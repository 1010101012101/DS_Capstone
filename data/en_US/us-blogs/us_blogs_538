ps.: I took that photo a few weeks ago, in the Tenderloin before going to that talk about Benjamin Franklin I told you about. What's really attracting me lately in my photos as I sort through them are the ones that are full of contrasts or contradictions. This image in particular really says more to me than I can describe.

If you know me at all, you know I'm not into getting stuff done just to be getting stuff done. Productivity in and of itself is overrated. It's factory-thinking. I'm not a factory. But creating the stuff I really want to create? That kind of productivity matters. So I try to choose my projects with care. And given my propensity to juggle, the forms they take -- the books, the canvases -- can occupy space in my head for a very long time. The zine, for example, has been on my list since last summer.
You see, he wanted the phones back to keep communication with the child, and to keep any evidence found against him. This man is angry that his actions have been interrupted, not repentant.

The portions here are huge, and Whit and I have been struggling to clear our plates at every meal. In Guatemala, it is considered rude if you don’t finish everything on your plate so we’ve been clearing them at every meal. I have to be more diligent about going into the kitchen and helping them when they serve my plate, because I’m getting stuffed from all the food.
There’s a much higher probability that with such a large unity government, and with (the Iranian) Mofaz at Bibi’s side, that a strike against Iran's nuclear weapon production facilities is very likely.
We ended up sitting next to the only two girls in the entire theatre that weren't excited to be there. They were constantly complaining and making fun of everybody for being excited. It took all my willpower to keep from asking them why they came. To top it all off, the girl that was complaining the most was a total arm rest hog. Her elbow was totally hanging over my side of the seat. I had to practically lean on Kelsie to keep from rubbing arms with this complainer. This was the only down side.

Bottled: Kernel Galaxy IPA
The basic ingredient is a board with a path drawn out on it. One simple way to do this is to draw a big S on a piece of paper and then a second S alongside, and to divide this pathway up into little squares. Or you can draw a path around the outside of a square (like a monopoly board) or a circular path. Circular paths lend themselves to games where you need to do more than one loop of the board and/or where you can change direction. I have used circular games where I'm trying to encourage a child to work on memorizing something, whether it is multiplication questions or sight words or homophones. One question/word/example is written on every square and whomever lands on it needs to answer the question, read the word or use the homophone in context. Using a small circle and doing several loops on it we can practice the same ten facts over and over.

Of the five men arrested, four were involved in the Occupy Cleveland movement, according to their Facebook profiles, a news story, and a federal criminal complaint.

A convoluted tale about a bunch of spies doing a bunch of spy shit in exotic locations, the film could be seen as a veiled screenwriting exercise on how to fill-in the gaps between the scenes that feature the beautiful Soledad Miranda behaving in an excessively leggy manner. From where I was sitting, anything that didn't involve Soledad Miranda lounging while leggy, holding a gun while leggy, or performing tasteful nightclub stripteases while leggy, was–to be blunt–a colossal waste of time. It's true, the script does manage to squeeze some of Soledad Miranda's legginess into the plot on occasion, but the film has way too many scenes involving middle-aged-to-elderly men plotting and scheming over the ownership this stone that can apparently turn everyday items into gold.

Next door to the Million Dollar Theatre is a wild place called the Farmacia Y Botanica Million Dollar, which has in addition to Jesus and Virgin Mary statues figurines of El Diablo (Satan) and The Grim Reaper. In addition to the incense and votive candles are green penis candles and red vagina candles. This is religion a la Burger King - "Have It Your Way", divinity and sex objects galore, a real action kind of place, y'know. A few steps away is the legendary Grand Central Market where you can buy any kind of food you like and then some. I saw a lot of cabezas (cow and sheep heads). I think I saw a few pig skulls, too, which reminded me of Rory Calhoun in "Motel Hell".

Kirsten Dunst reaches a turning point in her career with Melancholia. Her performance is unlike anything she has delivered before and as one of the main characters, she carries the film masterfully. Dunst plays Justine, the sister getting married at the start of the film. Quite the wild child compared to her sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), Justine lives in her own world and battles her depression even on what should be her happiest day. Dunst holds nothing back in her role and it shows, even enough to get her the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. She transforms herself from the lovable, uber-sexy bride to the deeply depressed and deeply disturbed sister that cannot eat, but spews hate towards her lovingly naive sister. It is this performance that should launch her career in new and bright futures, depending on where she decides to take off next.
"28. There remains one matter which must not be passed over in silence, and that is, to remind the priests of the whole world, as Our most dear sons, how absolutely necessary it is, for their own salvation, and for the fruitfulness of their sacred ministry, that they should be most closely united with their Bishop and most loyal to him. The spirit of insubordination and independence, so characteristic of our times, has, as We deplored above, not entirely spared the ministers of the Sanctuary. It is not rare for pastors of the Church to find sorrow and contradiction where they had a right to look for comfort and help. Let those who have so unfortunately failed in their duty, recall to their minds again and again, that the authority of those whom "the Holy Spirit hath placed as Bishops to rule the Church of God" (Acts xx. 28) is a divine authority. Let them remember that if, as we have seen, those who resist any legitimate authority, resist God, much more impiously do they act who refuse to obey the Bishop, whom God has consecrated with a special character by the exercise of His power. "Since charity," wrote St. Ignatius Martyr, "doth not suffer me to be silent concerning you, therefore was I forward to exhort you, that you run in harmony with the mind of God: for Jesus Christ also, our inseparable life, is the mind of the Father, even as the bishops that are settled in the farthest parts of the earth are in the mind of Jesus Christ. So then it becometh you to run in harmony with the mind of the bishop" (Ep. ad Ephes. iii.). These words of the illustrious Martyr are re-echoed throughout the ages by the Fathers and Doctors of the Church."

Barb didn't miss a detail. She really did a wonderful job tying together the colors in the designer paper. I love how she used the brown ribbon, brown cardstock layer and brown ink on the butterfly. The lacy ribbon edge, popped up saying and the popped up butterfly with the sweet little pearl center makes this card a real winner! I can't wait to see what she will come up with next.

I added a few basic pearls in the centers of the flowers and then I stamped my sentiment. I decided to dry emboss the pretty in pink layer in the middle of my card. I used my final press embossing folder- I sometimes do this just to give that little extra something to my cards and I'll left that border a little bigger around the edges.
The soup is something legendary though. It’s like a ratatouille, and you can add extras, or change things around depending on taste; I added some smoked sausage that I had just to bulk it up, but even without that, it was plenty bulky enough. I also admit to using olive oil rather than fry light, but I can’t imagine it making much of a difference to be fair, and rather than a fresh chilli (which for some reason I couldn’t find in Tesco), I found some frozen squares of minced chilli in the freezer cabinets – very useful! Some Weight Watchers people will probably be recoiling in horror, but then I’m not looking at losing weight especially. Sure I could do with trying, but I don’t want to pressurise myself – also I am surrounded by some true diet nutjobs who think about every gram of fat, every calorie, whether it’s a complex carbohydrate or not, and frankly, that shit bores me and it takes the joy out of food. I enjoyed this soup because of all the big chunks of various veggies, and knowing that I was getting some more veg in to my diet made me feel healthier, even if that weren’t necessarily the case.

Cream’s and Blake’s remarks point to what could be termed a remediation of research practices as print and digital interact, and both their talks highlighted searching as perhaps one of the most significant reconfigured practices. And indeed the concept of searching has undergone major reformulations in the digital environment. While accessibility and quickness of obtaining results are often seen as digital archives’ main advantage over print, a key benefit of digital collections resides in their enabling users to traverse immense areas of texts multi-directionally. Put another way, what seems radically different about searching in the digital world is not merely unprecedented access and speed, but rather the ways one can alter search strategies instantaneously, shifting not only the search terms employed at a moment’s notice but also the temporal and spatial coordinates in which those terms are placed. This capability expands the ways we are approaching the search as a strategy, opening up new conceptualizations even as we retain the habits and training we acquired working with print. As Wired magazine’s Kevin Kelly has observed: “What search uncovers is not just keywords but also the inherent value of connection…Search opens up creations. …As a song, movie, novel or poem is searched, the potential connections it radiates seep into society in a much deeper way than the simple publication of a duplicated copy ever could” (Kevin Kelly, “Scan this Book!” New York Times, 14 May 2006).
Things that public schools teach:
You can adjust the spices based on your tastes and what you have on hand. Curry powder is a blend in itself, but I like to beef it up with extra cumin (a favorite), and turmeric because it's good for you. Oh, and don't skip this recipe just because you don't have fresh ginger on hand. Just skip the ginger (and maybe use dried instead?). As far as vegetables, I used cauliflower, spinach, and halved grape tomatoes this time, but it varies every time.

I absolutely LOVE how this has turned out. It was my first attempt at princess seams and they are so flattering! I don't think i need to make any changes to the pattern at all, which is a first. This muslin was made out of an old sheet and it isn't obvious from the pictures but it is a bit faded and washed out so sadly not really wearable i public! I kind of wish I'd gone straight for fashion fabric now but I'm to chicken to not make a muslin! My chosen fabric for this is a print, but i really like how it looks here in a solid colour, plus this would give so many more wardrobe options! I have a feeling i will be making many of these. Also, this version is not hemmed and you can see that it it quite long on me...i can just about get away wearing it as a tunic-style top, so I can see that by modifying the pattern slightly it would be quite easy to turn this into a tunic or even a longer dress. In fact, Ashley is in the process of attempting something of the sort. So many options!
So, to be clear, you ultimately don't need to be going seven miles a second to begin with. You can alter your velocity on the way up however you please...but in the end, you'll have to end up spending at least as much energy as you would've going 7 miles per second initially.

In both meteorological and anecdotic terms, this story was a slow burner. It began on August 4th when temperatures in the capital reached 35°C. A temperature rarely seen in Paris, but not exceptional in France. That first day, we just took cool drinks and slept with the windows open.
Betty Francis, known as Betty Draper in seasons one and two, is a former model with a college education. She gave up her career to raise her first two children, Sally and Bobby, and was forced to do it again when Don felt threatened by her independence. Betty remained in the subservient housewife role, taking care of Sally and Bobby, carrying Don’s third child, and tending to his every desire. However, we quickly learn their marriage expires and Betty moves on to her second unhappy marriage with Henry Francis, a political figure. Betty’s character represents the 50’s ideal woman, with no real role, but her boredom drives her to regularly visit a psychiatrist, showing us that there is more to this ice princess than what meets the eye.

4. Hold a drunken intervention- Nobody likes being told they have a drinking problem. Especially by other drunks. So next time you host a party, invite one friend to come over later than the rest. When everyone is good and sauced, the other friend will be arriving. But when they do, you will all be sitting in a circle of chairs, waiting for them. A keg will be in the middle, some people will already be passed out, and you will be dancing to Lionel Richie’s “Dancing on the Ceiling.” When they approach you, yell over the music and tell them, “We need to talk about your drinking. It’s gotten out of hand!” Before he can angrily reply, chug your entire beer, and burp in his face. If he storms out of the room, you win. If he doesn’t, you lose. But at least you can still go back to drinking.
The enemy charged the bridge, but your Lanterns held them back until the bodies were stacked knee deep. Distracted, the enemy leader was struck down by Matsu Barbosa! Yet, the leader was unbelievably strong, surely blighted by the power of the Dark Oracle, and she turned and slashed the brave Matsu with a lethal blow. Now this next part you might think I’m exaggerating, but I am as truthful as Ikoma Katsu when I say that I believe I saw the very Thunder Dragon form in the clouds to bless the heroism and sacrifice of the Lion Deathseeker. Nearly dead, but inspired by the void, she ignored her wounds and cut down the enemy leader. Who luckily exploded like a Yobanjin, right in the middle of the enemy archers, scattering them!

It’s cold, it’s raining. Having so many people to talk with tires me!! I’ve been used to the exclusive conversations with John. Not turn taking! My older daughter comes over too. Don’t get me wrong, I love seeing them. But there seems so much to say on all sides. Somehow the essence of our conversation becomes distilled to such pithy sound bites they lose their quality and context. All these wonderful places I’ve seen jostle with newsy items about work, children, social gossip, other members of the family who have spoken with my daughters while we were away.

The episode proved to be interesting before anything even happened. First of all, Adam Levine’s shaved head was doing really great things for him. That man just never looks bad, I’ve decided. Cee Lo, however, opted for a laced up V-neck shirt (if you can call it that) and a wig. This look was doing nothing for him, but it was amusing. In fact, he barely said anything without laughing at himself. And finally, I don’t know what Christina Aguilera has been up to during the filming break, but she looked AMAZING! Good for you, Christina. Good for you.
We don’t know how it happened. Last year, I painted an aged Desoto in a pasture in Cotter, Arkansas, during a Plein Air competition that I was judging. Outdoor Painter magazine (an online home for Plein Air magazine) published my painting in its announcement of this year’s competition. None of those in charge of the event know how the picture got lifted–it is not included in their Facebook albums. At any rate, I’m very pleased and proud to be published again. I just don’t know who to thank.

With your beer goggles firmly affixed, Midnight's at its best this time around. The band's honest brand of heavy metal gone black is a complete homage to bands like Venom, Motorhead, Mercyful Fate, and finds itself best amongst friends, clinking beers and waves of hair in constant motion. A cleaner production this time around, Satanic Royalty begins with perfect pacing as the title track eases you into the driving NWOBH influenced "You Can't Stop Steel." Catchy leads, hook driven rhythm guitars, sing-along lyrics and pumping drums pen Midnight as catchy and credible as heavy metal can get.
Yeah. It was basically full of the kind of dehumanising, exploitative stuff you’d think would have gone extinct the way of circus freak shows by now.

There was a lot of criticism of Bec's hair and dress on Facebook. Personally, the dress was not my style (too much like a doily), but I loved the much-maligned veil and hairdo - anything inspired by the 1920s wins my heart, and I thought Bec looked great.

Keenan Allen is a special player with a very bright future. This was the first time I have seen Allen play and I came away more than impressed. Allen is a gifted runner in the open field and it is easy to see he has the vision and overall ability to create yards after the catch. Allen posesses a good frame at 6-3 205 lbs and will look to develop more size and strength in subsequent seasons as he is only a Sophomore. Watching Allen it is plain to see he has exciting ability to create plays in the open field. He is an extremely effective cut-back runner who shows a unique ability to see cut-back lanes and read/follow his blocks nicely. I don’t believe Allen posesses break away speed but that is not to say he can’t beat you deep/stretch the field and use his big frame and body control to shield himself from the defender and the ball. From what I saw in last nights game, Allen also runs very crisp routes and is very sudden in and out of his breaks as he does a good job keeping the defender honest. It was also encouraging to see Allen working hard out on the edge to block for his team-mates and it was obvious to see he takes great pride in this part of his game. Allen still has room to grow, but the future for this kid is bright…he may already be the best WR in the Pac-10. Keenan will go onto become the best WR to come out of California since Desean Jackson (Eagles), it will be fun to watch him and QB Zach Maynard develop chemistry over the next season or two.

Which is why on the train last night I tried to pull away, to break off the kiss, to save it for later. I was getting too worked up too quickly and we both knew it. Fortunately there was hardly anyone on our car, but still. If it weren't for the rattle and hum they all would have been able to hear my breath speeding up, catching, coming out on a sigh that was going to go rogue and turn moan any second now if I wasn't careful. The way your tongue probes, circles, thrusts and withdraws…you've got my nipples hard, my clit throbbing, my whole body yearning for yours. And you hold my face in both hands the same way you do when you shove your cock into my mouth. And that makes me want nothing so much as to be on my knees in front of you, right now, and it's all I can do to stop myself, and then you pinch my nipple, close to the wall where no one can see, and I gasp. I'm trembling, I want you so badly. You start a rhythm with your lips and tongue on mine and I receive you into me greedily, gratefully, and it's silly but I’m actually lightheaded just from this, just from kissing you.

In true MIA form, we all gathered poolside; watching the girls (and occasional guy) trot down the runway wearing vibrant and flowy teal/nectarine/electric blue pieces. The crowd was ultra chic and this made for great people watching. I saw some amazing outfits on and off the runway.

Yesterday, in what was described as a ‘friendly merger’, the CBOE Stock Exchange (CBSX), an all-electronic exchange created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and four market-maker partners in 2007, is acquiring the National Stock Exchange (NSX), the latest exchange merger as more trading goes electronic. Terms weren’t disclosed. The transaction, which should complete fairly swiftly, would bring data systems and business operations from both exchanges together into one platform.

While I didn’t do much in the artistic category this week, I did work on the book I am writing, which is in itself another sort of artistic venture. I started on this story late in 2008 while in college, and have been writing and rewriting the story ever since. The initial inspiration to write this particular story was very strong, but how does one keep the inspiration going past that? After six years of working on a project, how do you muster the inspiration to stay excited about it? Somehow, I do. It’s a problem that can also apply to just about anything in life–projects, training, working on your dream job. So here are a few things I do that help me stay inspired and keep working at it.

Scottish football fans have had something of a reputation in the past for being, um, “passionate” about the teams they support, most prominently the fans of Glasgow teams Celtic and Rangers. While one can appreciate a little mindless healthy competition between gaggles of admirably supportive fans, the fur starts to fly far so often between these two groups that it’s impossible not to ignore it. We’re at the point that national news is headlined by stories of letter bombs being posted to members of Celtic FC (designed, as stated, “to cause harm”, as letter bombs generally tend to be), sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with international events of real standing. All this over a sport designed with friendly competition in mind.

This is not what I set out to blog about today. I started to write a post, read it back - and then decided to delete it. One of the things I find particularly satisfying about writing a blog is the way it challenges you to examine what you think.

If the weave was tight enough, the basket could hold water. It swelled and kept the water in and the owner cool on a hot day. Woven mats kept your seat on a stone softer; kept your food from touching the blanket used for a “table” cloth.
I am lucky. I’ve been able to release this tension through walks, through tears, and — at the beginning — through screaming. I have not passed all the landmarks of grief — some people experience their worst pain at eight months, others need two years just to regain their equilibrium, and of course, there are all those firsts that are yet to come: the first Thanksgiving, first Christmas, first anniversary of his death — but perhaps the worst of the storms have passed. Or I could be fooling myself. This sad but not terribly painful stage I am going through could be just a hiatus, the eye of a storm, and the forces of grief are gathering themselves for a new onslaught. These months of grief survival, however, have taught me that I will be able to endure whatever comes.
When I’m in a meeting, either one-on-one or with a group, and people start acting French, I have to try really hard to zen out. To not let it bother me. To relax my shoulders and not count all of the minutes of my day that I am losing because everyone has to take a turn at saying pretty much the same thing—unless there is a debate, in which case, everyone needs a turn at expressing his or her own opinion and we can count on sitting around that table for a good hour.
Last but not least, Jessica sang “And I’m Not Telling You” by Jennifer Holiday. Once again she gave an absolutely amazing performance. You can feel that “goosebumps” inside you. She blew away everyone tonight with that performance and the judges actually liked it and gave her a standing ovation. Randy said the 16-year-old songstress is “phenomenal.” Steven said it was “another winning performance,” while Jennifer said it seems like it’s going to be a real race to the finish…with a performance like that there’s nothing to say…it was a real moment. Randy said this is one of the hardest songs to sing…” you got up there and slayed it…you are phenomenal! “.

The DA revealed that the problem extends to the amount government is spending on travel, restaurant expenses and accommodation. The DA asked a generic question to each national department and, of the 19 departments to have responded to date, between March 2008 and September 2009, a total cost of R1.7-billion has been incurred.
So do ponder on this … … there are so many possible subplots, you might just … er, lose the plot? The trick … make complex seem simple.
Instead of focusing solely on the benefits of immigration, which is namely to sustain the population and economy, the government should look at the entire problem from a holistic perspective.

It is hard to accept that a better quality of life is within reach and is yet still being denied to me because of bureaucracy and procedure. But I am going to suck it up and carry on regardless. This is my life – difficult as it often is – now, and so I am going to live it. If and when help comes – because, who knows, I may never get the treatment I need, especially as growth hormone is expensive and may not be considered vital to me, given that I have survived this long without it – then I will be grateful. In the meantime, there is plenty to keep me going, and even the odd synchronicitous event to remind me that life is more mysterious than we generally give it credit for. I’m going to make the most of all the things that give me pleasure – music, books, writing and family – and keep trying to put one foot in front of the other with as much verve, vibrancy and vivacity as I can muster.

Here is where you will put what you have planned into practise. So you know what looks you are going for, you have found some common ground, you have also mentally penned some questions to ask during the shoot in order to stimulate expressions and you are confident with your equipment, I then explain to the customer that I will need to do the test images to make sure that I have perfect images ‘in camera’. this allows you to get the settings you require as well as relax your client and ease them into the shoot. Once I am satisfied that I have the correct settings I then start the conversation off and before you know it you have ended the shoot.

Another major factor involved in how adults perceive teens is emotion. In the teenage years, hormones increase to make all the changes for adult life. A side effect is increased emotions. The emotional teen is a sterotype to many adults. And they're often written off with a "This too shall pass." I appreciate that message, and sometimes it's neccessary, but it can come off as patronising. Sometimes. the message a teen really needs isn't "Deal with this, until it gets better," but just a simple acknowledgement. "I know it hurts."

When I finished dry heaving, I kept walking. I called Shiro and told him to come pick me up. I think he was feeling guilty from earlier drama so he did unquestioningly. I got in his car, told him I didn’t want to talk about it at that point, and asked him to take me to the grocery store because at that point I really needed to have something in my stomach. I feel even shittier when my blood sugar is low, and since that is one aspect of the situation I could control, drink/food seemed good. I got fruit punch and a bagel (I wasn’t sure I could keep solid food down at that point, but got the bagel anyways for later), then we went to Shiro’s place where we both kind of conveniently set aside drama temporarily because I was totally overwhelmed and basically having an emotional meltdown.

Granted this project is not costing the taxpayers money--presumably. I'm sure some taxpayer expenses were incurred in the logistics surrounding the transport of the rock, not to mention possible road damage. However, a major emphasis has been made that the rock installation is being fully funded by private donors.
But ... beliefs that limit our actions and thoughts can be just as devastating as positive beliefs can be empowering. So there comes a point where each and every one of us has to look at our beliefs ... and challenge them.

But what makes Michael Kitchen ultimately so sexy may be simply his timing: the myriad, slightly syncopated pauses as he speaks, the subtle hesitations, alterations and reconsiderations in the movement of his face and body as he reflects, questions, listens, watches. This is a man uncommonly alive to every moment in its particularity. This is the basis both of moral strength and, for me, of sex appeal. Graying and craggy though Kitchen may be, slight of stature and soft of voice, these traits serve less to camouflage than to highlight the thrilling contradiction of his crackling vitality.

Play is a fabulous way to learn. It engages, focuses, and socializes us. Games require various grades of discipline and a balance between competition and community spirit. They provide a context for concepts that might otherwise be presented as isolated, sterile specimens in a subject/unit/lesson curriculum structure. Playing poker we practice memorizing and applying a rather arbitrary hierarchy (hand ranks), we touch on probability, and do simple money math (making change and bidding within our means). Spades and Pinochle are more of the same, with a more complex system of play and points in place of the money. Monopoly (our version has a Star Wars: The Clone Wars theme) involves oodles of reading and intensive money math. Battleship introduces a coordinate system and challenges us to innovate and test search strategies. Master Mind is a recent favorite which requires a very focused kind of logic. I Spy, Chess, Tic Tac Toe, Set, Fluxx, Aquarius, the zillions of online games available (Ragdoll Physics games are a recent favorite), video games, run-around-and-tag-people games, target-shooting with bows and arrows, imaginative role-playing -- ALL games require thinking and many games exercise specific, broadly applicable skills. Kids can never play too much.

A book signing will follow the performance, and every child who attends will receive a free "Shlemiel Crooks" book plate. Although this will be the only performance at Merkin Hall this year, the Kaufman Center has already decided to present the play again next year.

Former Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjonovich once said “never underestimate the heart of a champion” and Winston Churchill once said “never, never, never give up”. Such is the nature of human beings that some refuse to be down for long. To date the greatest 100 meter runner in history, Maurice Greene (Bolt has a few more titles to win) rose up from the depths of being defeated. By contrast, multiple record setters Leroy Burrell and Asafa Powell, were unable to find victory when it mattered most. One of my favorite sayings (at least I think I said it first) is “it ain’t how fast you run, it’s when you run fast”. Meaning that regardless of how fast an individual is he/she has to be able to do so when it matters most. It is those intangibles – desire and ability to perform at one’s best under pressure – that make most champions.
46NYC had the goal of raising $5,000 over the course of the night. Unfortunately, some of the costs to put on the show were much higher than anticipated and there were other unseen costs that crept in...but that didn't stop 46NYC. 46NYC has pledged, as a business, to cut a check to Reece's Rainbow in Ryan's honor for $2,500 and have reaffirmed their willingness and desire to continue to advocate and raise funds for him. We continue to be amazed at their generosity and perseverance...and the amount of fun that they can pack into anything!

The next three chapters focus on sex discrimination and equality. Serena Mayeri explores the equal protection jurisprudence and the judicial interpretation of American constitutional law in relation to Fronterio v Richardson (1973). Martha Minow interrogates Vorcheimer v School District of Philadelphia (1977), unpicking conflicts in feminist approaches to single-sex public education, the current state of such schools and the often contradictory justifications for them. In United States v Virginia (1996) Katherine Bartlett investigates the way in which equality was conceptualised in this challenge to women’s exclusion from the Virginia Military Institute ( a state supported single sex school), taking an approach based on a more nuanced interpretation of equality than the traditional same or difference approaches.

Apparently this “angel” allows people to even refer to him as God (i.e. YHWH), refers to himself as God (i.e. YHWH), takes the credit for God’s covenants with the patriarchs, takes the credit for the exodus, accepts and even initiates worship of himself, and has the power to give and take life, produce offspring, and build one’s name among the nations.

As it stands, if the policies were to change tomorrow without proper consultation it wouldn’t work. There would be no point decriminalising a drug addicts actions and sending them to a hospital were they may not want to get clean and the hospitals having no power to force rehabilitation upon them. Despite how idyllic it may sound. Although the system now is equally not working, as the amount of drugs in prisons worldwide is undeniable and if society can’t stop drug users taking drugs in a secure prison what hope have we got to try keep them clean in society.

We were up early and we decided to drive into town. Peter Brennan had suggested we take the big green tour bus around Dublin because you can hop on and off all day. So we were on a big green double-decker bus as we toured around Dublin. At the end of the day we concluded that it was probably the best way to see Dublin and make the most of our limited time.
A large portion of my accompanying video for today's story was shot by Hellen Osgood. When initially viewing it, I was disappointed that the running commentary by her husband Harvey was audible through most of the footage. However, on reviewing it and listening to what he had to say, I found his insightful thinking to be the best part of the event and much more interesting than watching the courted stonewalling her courter. His commentary was unintentionally very funny, offering much needed comic relief to a rather tragic affair. Below are some of Harvey's pithy remarks. Please be reminded that at the time he made them, we all thought this was a marriage proposal.

As a geography teacher, I am happy to say that all my students from school know lots of things about earthquakes, and in a weird way, I hope that this will help and encourage them when it comes to revision for their GCSE Geography exams, nothing like practical and hands on experience to put learning into context! Especially since all schools have been cancelled today. Myself and my neighbour were actually out at the bazaari yesterday and felt a few tinyshakes. Had we not been together, we probably would have both thought that we had an inner ear problem, but because we were both experiencing the same thing, we guessed an earthquake might come soon as tremors are often the sign of more to come. So I knew this morning when things started shaking a little in the house and my usually very lazy cat and dog suddenly jumped off the bed and looked at each other, before deciding it was ok to return back to their sleeping positions a few minutes afterwards. Animals often have a sixth sense for these things. Then my neighbour called to confirm that it was indeed an earthquake.
Layout and Atmosphere: If you approach from Burlington Road, you will see a big sign on the side of the building with the Tango West name. They have taken over full or partial responsibility for the hall, and so have a good deal of control. As you go in it feels more like an upmarket village hall or school hall than a gym or health club as you might expect from the name. There is an entrance hall with the kitchen opposite you, the loos on your right behinds some felt screens with notices, and the dance hall on your left. You have a bit of space to sort yourself out and take your coat off. The dance hall itself is quite large, more or less square, and has a pleasing wooden ceiling with a peculiar construction I don't know the name of but which reminds me of a sort of hammer-beam, only going all the way round to make a square. I think it's really some sort of steel suspension thing. The floor is the same colour but a different pattern, and in very good condition. You are asked not to wear shoes that may damage it, and heel covers are available. Refreshments are to your left, along with a sofa, under a sort of partly-curtained gallery, and there are plenty of chairs set around little tables on the other three sides of the room. They warm it more with I think a red gauze curtain under the gallery, and little purply fake tealights on the tables. There are no chairs alone or against the walls.

The story is told from multiple points of view and sometimes that doesn’t work for me, but in this context it was brilliant. You not only get to see what the victim is thinking but you get to experience every side of the story and it really helps pull you in. I won’t lie one of the POV’s is very disturbing and I almost skipped those parts but I read them and it gave the story a whole new level of creep factor.

Until I learn how to kindly and humourusly convey my life here, it really is a stretch to blog about things that are fun for me to write about.

My mother was always very strong and strict Catholic throughout her life. She had the most simple, child like faith I think of just about anyone I’ve known. Every night she would get on her knees by her bedside and say her prayers…rosary…novena, etc. She was actually quite upset when I left Catholicism, and it took her a long time to get over that and realize I hadn’t left God, but had in my own life gotten closer to Him.
Michelle sent me an email in March 2010 saying, "Good news! Best discussed over the phone." She told me two, possibly three editors were interested in MAY B., something I never expected from my very non-commercial book. It was amazing to talk with three people who loved my work, had shared it with others in their office, had thought through ways to strengthen the storyline, etc. The work editors are willing to put into a book before even knowing its theirs is amazing. In the end, I decided to work with Nicole Geiger at Tricycle Press. After a combined ten rounds of edits, line edits, and copyedits, the book was ready to go.

The exhibit ran through the beginning of 2002. The gallery began printing and selling the photos, donating all proceeds to the Children's Aid Society. By Christmas Eve, the gallery had sold more than 30,000 prints. A book was produced. Eventually a comprehensive website was created, where every photograph was archived and made available to the public. A video archive of oral histories joined the photographic archive online. The original exhibit toured the United States for nearly a year.

But it got me thinking.

The award days were not over yet. Today the primary school held their "Best of the Best Assembly" and I was very proud to sit there and watch my little Kitcat receive her very first Academic achievement award. I thought it as cute how they had a photo of each child projected onto the wall behind the stage as they came up to be presented with their award. Seeing as she is in a Prep/1 composite class, Kitcat's achievement is even more impressive, although not totally unexpected because the teacher has been telling me all year how Kitcat does her Prep work very quickly, then asks to do the Year 1 work and often finishes that even before most of the other Year 1 students. Kitcat also received a $15 book voucher with her certificate, and she is looking forward to going book shopping with me.

Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, 20 always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Our final (full) day in New York was another busy one for us as we still had plenty of Nabeela’s list to go through. We started off with a walk through Central Park. Central Park is a massive, landscaped park in, well, the centre of New York. It’s rectangular and is sized to fit within the Manhattan grid system and is well worth a visit. Whilst cars can drive through bits of it, it is possible in many areas to not hear the sounds of cars whizzing past – so it’s a relative oasis of calm in a crazy-busy city. We wandered around the lakes and the Jackie Onassis Reservoir (not that impressive, just a bit puddle of water really). Nabeela was her usual trigger-happy self whilst I was my usual sucker-for-taking-photos-for-other-people – I could make a career out of this. Nabeela has become very proficient with our Micro 4/3rds (a mini-slr) [link to wiki on camera-type], spending loads of time tinkering with the settings to get the photo she wants. I remember when we first got the camera (as a wedding present from my Khala) that I figured I would be using it most – I think it has turned out to be Nabeela that has in fact.
I have been reading as many of the suggestion pages for a successful shop on the Etsy forums as I possibly can. The first thing they all said was Google your shop name and make sure it doesn't come up a bunch of times in the listings before you start....humm...I had already started so, scratch that, lol.

As I approached the lectern on the first day, I noticed he was holding twenty or thirty pages of quarto lined paper, closely written in a very even hand. I can still see that writing vividly now and could pick out his style from amongst any number. There was not a crossing out or an addition in the margin; I can't even remember if there was a margin down the side. I don't think so. He didn't believe in wasted space.

Julia gets freaked out so much that she starts crying, and of course Larry thinks it’s his fault – you’ll have to excuse him. He is just a true blue simple country boy from the sticks! I just love the look on his face here:

Rejecting Maisie’s idealised portrait of Melancolia, inspired by James Thomson’s poem The City of Dreadful Night, Dick decides to work on his own painting on the same theme, which will draw on his knowledge of life and his own feelings of despair. As his model, he takes the angry Cockney girl Bessie Broke (“Stone-broke, if you like”), who faints with hunger on his doorstep and is taken in by Torpenhow. It’s hinted that Bessie may be a prostitute, especially in a late scene where she is seen walking the streets in her finery, but this is never actually stated. However, there is a scene where she offers to live with Torpenhow, saying that she knows he will not marry her, but would be willing to stay with him just until he meets “Miss Right”. The lonely Torpenhow (a moving portrayal by Walter Huston) is tempted to agree, but Dick steps in to stop them getting together, sending his friend away.

When I left Tracey Baxter's copy of Hounds Of Love at a Southampton bus stop in 1985, Kate Bush was not the rare beast she is today. A new album? Not to worry, there'll be another along in a minute, a bit like the bus we got on not realising the bag we'd put down for a just a moment was never to be seen again. Kind of like Kate today really.

It’s the same concept Jesus expressed to the religious elite of his day: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.” (Matthew 23:23)

Yes, we are that easy.
Then in his later statements he said: “We will work with the U.N. and other world leaders to ensure that terrorism is brought under control.” I saw my president saying this on TV.

I do not fear Islam. But I will fight it. I will stand strong as a heathen, and make them remember, should they strike me, why Everyone the world over, especially the Christians, but even some Muslims, fear the craft of the Vikings to this day. My forefathers came from our frozen lands as Vikings in order to preserve their culture and religion, leaving behind so much beyond the two hundred years of their war. Now we, the sons and daughters of those Norse/Germanic people, must be ready to rise again, to hold sacred shield, and defend ourselves and our children.
The letter is dated 28th June 1984. Two months earlier, the Daily Mail had run a story about Skoal Bandits, an American form of snus made by US Tobacco Inc. who were due to build a factory in Scotland. Shortly thereafter, ASH's director David Simpson started a moral panic about this smokeless tobacco product which ultimately resulted in the EU ban on oral tobacco (1992). See Chapter 4 of The Art of Suppression for the full story.

LPR which has the capability of checking and gathering plate number in swifter ways than an officer can perform in this regard, and it serves as most important tools for force multipliers ever found for law enforcing. If used in proper ways, LPR can bring about spectacular performance in the matter of law enforcement and thereby turning into a useful tool.

Far from saving the future for their children, I would suggest to you that, since World War II, conditions of life have been introduced by those who hold power over us which are calculated to bring about the destruction, at the very least in part, of those very children, the native people of Europe. Meanwhile measures have been introduced intended to significantly reduce the number of Native European births.

The initial taste was only faintly acidic and more on the savory end of the produce spectrum. Although most will claim which berries and citrus their wine tastes most like, I would go on a limb to say this was more like a light and lofty melange of tomatoes, mint, and black currant. This interesting little pairing went so well with a simple dish of turkey meatballs and tomato sauce that my wife had prepared. As the wine lasted through dinner into dessert, I made a simply dessert out of merely a glass of wine, and a 70% dark cocoa chocolate bar. Sinfully delicious with just enough creaminess to combat the gentle acidity of the wine.
Le Chateaubriand fell short of my expectations. The atmosphere, the service, the dishes, none of it screams, or even nonchalantly mentions in passing…”Top 10″, or even”Top 50″. The meal is good value, as is the alcohol on offer, but the whole package feels unsatisfying and a bit disappointing.

We also listened to a rich woman's lawyer talk about saving her property from one such intrusive road-project, by installing a "modern roundabout," and we then watched a little video about the roundabouts, which keep traffic moving and save energy and so on. GPATS board member Jim Burns immediately said it was a good idea... and by my calculations (noting the map where this rich woman's property is), I figured out that Burns is her County Council representative, so he knows which side his bread is buttered on, as my grandmother used to say.
So when I heard that Katherine Langrish had written a story imagining what might have happened if one of the merman's children had gone to try and fetch her mother back, my first thought was that I wanted to read it, and my second was to wonder whether I could cope with a happy ending. I'm glad to report that I could.

Part of me believing it was always something that I’d done
Honestly, I think over the years I have become so different from my family that I am unconsciously looking for similarities. This may sound sad, but it’s not. I love my family, each and every one. They’re a special bunch and I can appreciate all of their peccadilloes. But it seems the more we live our own lives, the less alike we become.
When I first started really exploring the world of beer -- beyond the big-brand, ubiquitous beers that adorned the bars of Ireland at the time -- one family of beers that really hit a home run were the strong Belgian ales, particularly the Abbey and Trappist beers. Westmalle (usually the Tripel) and Chimay (Blue or Red) were the norm, as they were fairly readily available in the likes of The Porterhouse, where most of my beer exploration of the late 90s was carried out. My lust for these beers waned over the years as I began to prefer hop bombs, and I began finding them a little overly sweet. But I'd have one now and again, particularly if I found myself in Belgium. But for some reason, until recently I had never tried the Rochefort beers. In fact, it's kind of weird to realise that Rochefort were the only Trappist beer that I haven't tried (or at least not that I can recall)!

I created the cylindrical focal bead pendant from translucent polymer clay, using an image transfer technique. The image depicted is a rose mallow bush.

Koons has been the subject of several previous lawsuits for copyright infringement. In the late 1980s, he created a series of sculptures for an exhibition entitled the “Banality Show” (“Banality”). In doing so, he commissioned large three-dimensional reproductions of images taken from such sources as commercial postcards and syndicated comic strips. Although many of the source images were copyrighted, Koons did not seek permission to use them. In separate cases based on three different sculptures from “Banality,” two district courts concluded that Koons's use of the copyrighted images infringed on the rights of the copyright holders and did not constitute fair use under the copyright law. See Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 934 (1992); Campbell v. Koons, No. 91 Civ. 6055, 1993 WL 97381, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3957 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 1993); United Feature Syndicate v. Koons, 817 F.Supp. 370 (S .D.N.Y.1993).

Just goes to show why I never get my hopes up. If you expect the worst, then when it happens you can deal with it accordingly knowing that this is how shit was going to work out in the first place. But on the rare occasion of life going opposite your shitty attitude, it feels pretty fucking great! This is not the latter.
Funny thing happened the first week of last month. I was paranoid about not doing my dishes and making my bed. I mean, I publicly said I would, so then I got super panicked if I didn’t. Then the panic wore off and the laziness slipped in. I would say that most days the bed got made somewhat (no, I didn’t always put all those freakin’ pillows on it). I can honestly say that the kitchen during the month remained a lot cleaner, but the dishes did not get done every day. More like every other day.
Jack Wagner got all 8s for his samba with Anna. His memorable year was last year when his daughter showed up in his life and told him he was her birth father. No details or anything, but he was touched by it and thrilled to have her in his family. She and his other children were there cheering him on. Apparently she bounded in before a concert and told him. That's a lot to deal with any time but right before going on stage! I wonder more about all this. Jack and Anna danced to one of his songs, which I'm not familiar with. Actually, I don't know who he is. Just read his bio and know why. I never watched General Hospital or Melrose Place. That explains it. (24)

I decided it was okay to list my phone number in my response because it is listed as a contact number in my dreamhorse ad, so this person already has access to that, but not my full name or address. And of course, the same precautions apply if I were actually to be contacted by phone about Sassy, although I doubt this scammer speaks good enough English to be able to pull of such a scam over the phone.

Actually, I shouldn’t be that hard on the show. The appeal of it is relatively straightforward and no more trashy than Daleks.

I am actually reading Generation X by Douglas Coupland, since next Wednesday it's the book up for discussion in the book group. I've never read it before, and I don't know why, since we've had the book in the house for years, and isn't it one of those books you really need to have read? Our copy is the early edition we bought when Coupland came to read at Manchester Waterstone's Deansgate. Its pages are laid out with the drawings and definitions of contemporary phrases positioned down the side of the text at strategic points in the story, rather than as footnotes ('CONSENSUS TERRORISM: The process that decides in-office attitudes and behaviour'). It's a lovely thing, a piece of art - which is not at all surprising, of course, since Coupland is also an artist. But what's really capturing me is, once again, the language and the insights - here's a character's description of Toronto: 'a city that when I once visited gave the efficient, ordered feel of the Yellow Pages sprung to life in three dimensions'. And the humanity: the relationships between his three thirtyish characters, friends dropping out to try and find a deeper meaning in life, are touching.

In response to this, we can only reply that laws, treaties, and the like are human constructs and therefore open to being changed by human efforts on the basis of human concerns.

So I am making do by having the French subtitles turned on and translating on the fly – how is that for peculiar in the US, hmmm? This works pretty well but it is a real bitch when something doesn’t translate well, or when the sentence structure is totally rearranged, or I have no freakin’ clue what the word evenis. But on the other hand, there are moments when it’s actually funnier in french. Such as when one character is referring to this chick’s ass, coming across the word “haunch” just cracks me up. Why? Just the word. Say it over and over again while picturing a well-formed tush and leg and it just sounds funny.

We went around, climbing the scree and fallen trees until a path opened to us. The ground climbed and soon we found ourselves looking down on the valley. Far away we saw the sea glinting on the horizon. We turned and the land was flat and empty. But the sun was like a marble, shining down on the hard scrabble sand that lay for miles in front of us.

However, cloud storage is not without its limitations. Some business and/or government departments have concerns or even specific requirements around the retention of data within geographical or political regions. Some companies may insist that data is not stored in certain countries, while the likes of government departments may even insist that data is stored in within its political and legal control. Furthermore, the security of the data within the cloud itself needs to be verified before a company commits to the solution. Isolation of data from other companies and the control of access to an organisation’s data must be clearly controlled and ensured by the vendor. Finally, it must be remembered that with cloud storage, there is a dependency on the internet links and as a result there is a clear read/write performance impact that must be considered before adopting any cloud storage solution.
Paul was told of a new revelation coming his way. He was also told that he would have to be a witness of it. That word “witness” is from the Greek word martur from which we get our English, martyr.

As I’ve mentioned before, I recently started a new job. And as contrary as it may sound, this has actually meant that I have had more time to read. When I was unemployed and staying at home all day, I found other things that I could do instead of read, but now that I’m at work, my list of acceptable activities to do during a down moment has shrunk. But it does include reading. So I have been reading. And I have used this opportunity to reread some old favorites as well as catch up on my list of must-reads. Not surprisingly, both lists include books written by Brandon Sanderson. I have read everything that he has written now, except for his Wheel of Time books and I have thoroughly enjoyed his novels. He creates complex characters and puts them in impossible situations and allows them to grow and do amazing things. But what I love most about Brandon Sanderson is the incredibly inventive magic systems he creates for his books.

The US President also praised Arab citizens in countries such as Libya and Egypt for having the courage to seize their freedom from unruly dictators during the Arab Spring. One thing is for certain, even though Abbas’s bid for statehood will ultimately fail, the glaring hypocrisy of Obama’s foreign policy towards the Middle East has become embarrassingly obvious. The continuous violation of Palestinian human rights by Israel is without a doubt on par with some of the crimes carried out by regimes such as Gaddafi’s. America’s decision to veto does nothing more constructive than epitomise the image of politicians who openly talk of peace, but inadvertently promote war. With the Presidential elections looming next year, it seems Obama’s domestic political aims have trumped his international responsibilities. Never mind the Israeli war-planes continually bombing innocent civilians in Gaza Obama, you may be able to sway a few hundred on-the-fence voters with your pro-Israeli stance.

Rightly praised as an instant classic, Pete Townshend reaches high and (mostly) delivers on the amazing journey of a deaf, dumb and blind boy “Tommy” Walker. The Beatles had taken small steps in turning Pop Music into certifiable Art with Rubber Soul and Revolver. Sgt. Pepper was a big advance, using recording technology to enhance the listening experience, and The LP suddenly was no longer a couple of hit singles with a lot of filler. Tommy was a giant leap forward in taking a complex story line and weaving a musical tale around it. Pete seemed to expound on and slightly alter what the story really meant through the years, but the spiritual essence never changed. This is Townshend’s baby as much as Mrs. Walker’s.
The Battle: Both of these novels have strong openings. Greatshadow hits us with action from the first paragraph, quickly setting the stage for what promises to be very fun reading. Hell Train builds up a bit more slowly, but that's because the story is modeled after the style of the old Hammer horror films. I absolutely love how the first chapter, in which our protagonist arrives at the Hammer studio, is itself like a typical Hammer movie: the studio is in a secluded mansion, oddly quiet, where our hero meets a beautiful but enigmatic woman, while subtle hints of strangeness add to the gothic feel.
Now, it had always been recognized that the Greek of the New Testament was different in many ways from the classical language of the great Greek writers. Scholars tried to account for the peculiarities of this ‘biblical Greek’ in various ways; some, like Richard Rothe in 1863, suggested that it was a new ‘language of the Holy Ghost’,’ invented for the purpose of expressing divine truth. We do not, of course, deny that, in whatever language the New Testament was written, it would certainly be in one sense ‘a language of the Holy Ghost’, when we consider the good news and divine truth conveyed to us in that language; but the discovery of these unliterary writings in the sands of Egypt quite reversed the previous opinions of scholars, for they turned out to be written in much the same kind of Greek as the New Testament. The Greek of the New Testament, in fact, was very like the vernacular Koine or ‘common’ Greek of the day; the ‘language of the Holy Ghost’ was found to be the language of the common people – a lesson which we should do well to keep in mind.’
Though I’m restricted to a list of 33 suggested wishes – probably to keep out the crackpots who yearn unrealistically for the betterment of mankind, or similar nonsense – there’s a lot of good stuff to choose from. For example, number one is to win the lottery within two weeks; number two is to win a big prize on an instant-win scratch card; number nine is to win enough money to never have to work again; number 18 is to never have any more money problems; and number 21 is to win lots of money in the lottery. Not all of your dreams have to involve cash, though. Number eleven will get you a new car, number 15 will make you the owner of property that you can rent out, and number 33 will enable you to stop working and live off a substantial monthly income.

I popped out for a walk to clear a headache that Paracetamol just wasn’t shifting fast enough (and when there was no Ibuprofen in the house either) and discovered that at some point between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, my regular bus stop on the way to work had… burned down. Wonderful. I’ve yet to work out if a car had slammed into it and caught fire or if it was just one of the most random acts of arson this side of the North Sea. Thankfully, drivers still recognise it as a stop, even after the charred remains of the shelter were carted off to wherever dead bus shelters go. Further into my walk I made the spontaneous decision to get the next bus into Durham because I hadn’t been there in YEARS and chances are I probably won’t for a few more afterwards.

I learned these lessons at the literary knee of Mr. Monteleone and his contemporaries. I was a wet-behind-the-ears writer and the word from mutual friends was that I was green but I wanted to learn. So people like Tom, Craig Shaw Gardner, Charlie Grant, Lisa W. Cantrell, Brian Lumley, and more people than I could name here gave me advice, tips, pointers, that in one way or another pointed me to the topic I’m talking about today.

If you want subtitles to display for just that portion of the movie, and not all the way through, enable the subtitle checkmark for it, and in the subtitle language selection, select the second “English” track. The first one (#0) results in subtitles for everything, the other one (#2) results only in subtitles for the non-English parts of the movie.

One national poll – allegedly commissioned by Brussels – shows the New Democracy Party of Antonis Samaras holding onto its share of the vote, while Pasok has dropped from 19.8% to 15.5%. The Nationalist schism Golden Dawn was also seen to have enoyed a slight increase in popularity. If Pasok leader Venizelos has had sight of this poll, it would explain his desperate call, earlier in the week, for a ‘Grand’ Coalition….naturally, including him. In fact, I’m told that both main Party leaders know they are unlikely (based on the current numbers) to make up a majority of the votes cast. (The survey was leaked by a foreign Embassy in Athens, widely though to be Spain’s).
I remember the first time I flew anywhere. It was to Italy and I was eight years old and very, very excited. I probably wore my poor parents' ears half off with non stop questions about what it was like to fly through a cloud, and asking Dad if he could ask if I could see the cockpit. And I did. I was allowed to stand just outside the door for a few minutes to gape in astonishment at all the dials and switches and wonder how the hell anyone could possibly make sense of it all - I was expecting something like a slightly more complex version of the dashboard in the family Ford Cortina. Try asking that now for your eight year old and see where you get. No, you plug them into the in flight entertainment system and order a glass of Pinot before doing the same thing yourself. And now, according to Dick Puddlecote's comment, because of the man with the flammable crotch if you feel the need to go and release the products of that Pinot too close to landing time you'll now be told to hold it in. Presumably allowances will be made for people with medical conditions who are on diuretics, though I wouldn't be surprised if this meant handing you a jubilee clip. You'll have to tighten it up with your fingernails though, because there's no way they'll let you have a screwdriver.

If Commonwealth Act No. 671 is still in force and effect the question arises: how long and for what period will said Act continue to operate? As I have already stated, I believe that the delegation of emergency powers was made coextensive with the emergency resulting from the war, as long as that emergency continues and unless the Legislature provides otherwise, Act 671 will continue to operate and the President may continue exercising his emergency powers.

The study concluded that reusable bags had lower impacts than single use bags, but these benefits were highly sensitive to the number of times a bag was re-used. Not a surprising discovery, but more surprising was the fact that despite having the lowest impact on litter, and being made of renewable resources, paper bags had the highest environmental impact due to the energy embodied in their production. You can read more about the study and conclusions here and here. Since reading that, I’ve been carefully hoarding any bags (especially paper) we receive for re-use, and giving a bit more thought to the kind of bags we do use, or perhaps could use.

As I mentioned before, the Forces of Beauty series has the vampires as businessmen. The hero of the first book owns a hospitality and entertainment company who meets his lady in Crete at one of his resorts. (BTW, hubby and I stayed at this particular resort and I had it in mind when I wrote the location.) In the most recent release, A Vampire in Paris, the hero was in the first book as a secondary character and I had to give him his own love story. The company he works for is also owned by an ancient vampire who just might show up in a future book and he is one of the company’s best security investigators. You never know where the inspiration comes from! The heroines in both are “older” women, quite accomplished in their own professions but doubt their attractiveness to the “younger” men, until they find out who these men really are.

“And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him. Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.” (Matthew 17:1-9, KJV)
So, as I wrote late last year, it was amusing to see the furore created by some seemingly minor changes to this much loved brew among its biggest and most loyal fans. ‘Career VB Drinkers’ as they called themselves were falling over each other to have a crack at the Big House for daring to tinker with their cherished amber nectar. Letters to the editor pages were packed with Johnnos, Blueys, Knackers’s and Shags’s willing to renounce their ‘religion’ and threaten to switch brands because CUB had ‘changed the recipe’, ‘watered it down’ and even ‘switched the beer to XXXX’ as one melon-head claimed.

Here is a photo of a piece of the hand dyed wool felt. It is a 'salmon' colour. Hand dyed felt has irregularities in colour often, which adds to the beauty and versatility of the piece. I wanted to use the commercially dyed brown for the back of the scapular, as I wanted uniformity of colour. For everything else, I was happy for colours with some irregularity. The piece you see above is what I bought to make my Sacred and Immaculate Hearts...when you see the images of the Sacred Heart and Immaculate Heart below I have used for my designs, you will see how the irregular colour suits the hearts perfectly.
It has improved tremendously, actually. I’ve always loved performing, but there was definitely a time when I knew less. It’s like anything; you grow with it. All the different elements behind it: going from being able to create the right space around you, adjust to being on the road, and having the right people around you- in terms of the band and people working for you, having more knowledge of my instrument, and being able to connect with the fans. I find that when time goes on, I really find myself enjoying it more and more every tour.

I'm 37. I love my 30's- despite the enormous pressures and stress of 'it all' (insert your own itall) I have felt more confident, grounded and happy with myself in the last seven years than anytime before. Whatever stresses come my way, and they are plentiful, with love and other drugs I have weathered it fairly well. The thing that shows wear and tear? My skin. I'm a white girl with blue eyes and freckles. Any damage done from sun or stress to skin like mine ends up looking haggard quite quickly. Every shadow and indent on my face stands out against the background of pale Irish skin. I've worn sunblock pretty religiously since about 15 or 16, and I eat as organic and whole foods as we can on this tiny budget, but I can't erase the exhaustion and late lights/early mornings of the occasional life crisis and nursing and co-sleeping and raising four kids- I didn't nurse Ian, but raising him along with his Momma and Mr. Curry? Yes.
The calorie counts on these things are not accurate, since I didn’t enter age/weight stats, so I’m sure I did a decent job of sweating off some calories today. The owner of this gym remembered me from when I stopped in to check the place out, and his sweet golden mix is there to cheer on all the gym rats. The time I went (around 4:15) was pretty good-not too crowded at all. Naturally, I was the biggest person there working out, but people just stuck to their own routines, which is just fine with me. There was one gal who was a little on the bigger side, but boy, she was just powering through that elliptical work out–very inspiring! My new sneakers worked out pretty well, but I can tell I have some breaking in to do. And my knee did well overall, though I felt a difference every time I upped the speed on the treadmill. Ouch!

We (umm, I mean the children) are gathering about 20 eggs per day. And no, we don't use that many, but I am able to trade for fresh milk. This morning I've got two quarts of yogurt in the dehydrator and I've been making butter as well. I'm not getting as much milk as I was earlier in the year, but right now that's about all I can handle. I'll make more yogurt this week and then make yogurt cheese! Yummy! It's great with lots of added herbs for a cracker or bread spread.

The football season is firmly in tune with the seasons. It starts just as the summer is about to wind down. Those late summer evenings fade into autumn chill and then onto winter frosts, as surely as the tricky winger loses his interest as soon as the rain starts lashing down and the pitches begin to soften. The season has its youthful enthusiasm, those heady days of optimism, with everything ahead of us. We head on through it's mid life crisis, and the players are no longer shocked by defeat or stunned by their own successes. Towards the end of the season there's a weird sense of adjustment, of acceptance, that feeling that there's nothing to be done but to accept where we are, and what we have achieved.

The new devotional books are AWESOME. The boy woke me up in the middle of the night, and when I finally got him back to sleep Saint wanted to go out. While Saint was out, I fell asleep at my desk–NOT comfy at all. Saint has this habit of knocking on the door by bouncing the top half of his body off of it. Yeah, let’s just say, when I woke up in a puddle of drool, I thought the sky was falling there for a second, and I was WIDE awake. I couldn’t go back to sleep after that, so I was up till like 2:30 reading and looking over the new books. Anyway back to the story. The books have a page for praise reports and this morning the girls got to write about how God heard our prayers and fixed up Saint.

If you want proof check out Austin when the Texas State High School Championships come to town in May. The stadium will be packed and rocking with thousands of Texans who will show up to see the BEST that Texas high schools have to offer. The California State High School Championships will get the same treatment in June – packed stands and raucous fans. You see there IS lots of love for the sport here, but fans have been conditioned to see the best perform when they pay their money! Be it the Texas Relays; last year’s New York stop on the Diamond League, or the Carson meet in Los Angeles or several other “big” meets in the U.S., ticket sales are hard to push when the fans believe they are getting less than what the sport has to offer.

Why is he a great 1970's dad for all that? You can't understand most of what 1970's dads say either. Another reason is encoded in how Woodward's belle triumphs over both father and suitor through sheer her unyielding womanly wiles and will, and thus earns her Newman -- then and forever. That's the sign of a loving patriarch who, for all his assertive grandson-craving, clearly hasn't fostered fearful children. There's no indication of physical abuse in their faces, no ominous chords in the score indicating he might slap someone at any moment. His tantrums and demonstrations of force preclude all resorts to mundane physical or mental abuse to get his way (unless you count hollerin' - but since Woodward's not at all cowed by it, you shouldn't). I'm sure there's students of feminism out there who would object to his sheer ungainly macho manner, and maybe they're the reasons so many movie, TV, commercial fathers all talk in these high, wimpy little voices.
How is everybody doing in this freezing weather?
January brought some visitors our way...a very fun brother/sister duo. She lives in Ohio and he in Alaska...they are super close and super fun and we LOVED having them here for two weeks. While they were here, the need arose for Joel to go to one of our bases. Rather than me and our visitors just staying here, it worked out that we all got to go (our kiddos staying behind with our very good friends). I had never actually even been to another base before, so it was really neat to see it all up close and personal. Joel was very busy the whole time getting the float plane there up and running again. It was very rewarding to be able to test it out on our last day there...his first time to fly in a float plane.

Looking at it all spread out, there's definitely some Romanticism going on here. And as long as we're getting literary, I'll go ahead and say that the central American story from its early history - and some would say, to this day - is a combination of picaresque and bildungsroman. The young, upstart nation, making its way, forging forward, breaking the old rules along the way. America is a D&D character. D&D, although enjoyed globally, has an essentially American nature to it when played in old-school ways. And, if we acknowledge that, why not construct an 'American' setting? That's Wampus Country.

Hearing this, I gave her a smile, put my jacket on and hurried to leave. “Good luck with that” I said and left with mixed feeling of bittersweet.

For book publishers, the relevant market isn’t readers (direct sales are few), but booksellers, and Amazon has firm control of bookselling’s online future as it works to undermine bookselling’s remaining brick-and-mortar infrastructure. Amazon controls every growing segment of the industry: online physical books, downloadable audio books, online used books, and e-books. Amazon commands about 75% of the online market for print books, and 60% of the e-book market (a percentage that decreased from Amazon’s reported 90% two years ago, as a result of agency pricing).

For many years I was responsible for the administration of “IBRA Radio” in our church. We purchased an outdated shortwave transmitter with antenna and everything from Radio Sweden (SR), to be sent to Chapare in Cochabamba, Bolivia. The people in the villages there used to produce cocaine, but with the help of Sweden and other countries, the inhabitants there were able to start farming instead. The radio was used by IBRA for education and contact with people around in the jungle. “IBRA Radio AB” was founded in 1955 by mr. Lewi Pethrus, the founder of the Swedish Pentecostal movement. “IBRA Association” was membership based that attracted a lot of supporters. In the beginning they even had one hour in Swedish, but the main targets were programming to local radio stations all over the world. Today they transmit from stations FEBA and FEBC. They don’t have their own transmitters.
Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar—each was a master of war. Each had to look beyond the battlefield to decide whom to fight, when, and why; to know what victory was and when to end the war; to determine how to bring stability to the lands he conquered. Each general had to be a battlefield tactician and more: a statesman, a strategist, a leader.

are just some words that have stop wording. They’re either overused, nonsensical, gross, or some combination of all three. And of course I’m going to list them for you because come on. It’s both words and complaining. It’s pretty much the crux of what this blog is about.
Today my "picky" thoughts are running wild after listening to a broadcast on foster care. My sister and her husband, after having two children of their own, made the decision to take babies into their home through foster care. A noble thing to do. In essence, they are "picking" children who may feel "unpicked". Each child is brought into their home and cared for and loved as their own. They are given the very best and an abundance of love! The message overflowing in their home is, "You are worth it! You are chosen! You are picked! You are not disconnected or separated. You are part of us."
After the break, Chefs Daniel Boulud, Gilles Verot, and Mark Fiorentino prepared Liberty Farm Duck Tourte with Figs and Rillettes de Lapin Aux Olives (Rabbit with Olives). Daniel Johnnes, Wine Director for The Dinex Group, paired the dishes with Philippe Foreau Vouvray Demi-Sec (2003). The rillettes was my favorite tasting by far! Chef Verot is a master of Head Cheese, and we were able to taste his Fromage de Tete. Head Cheese, in my opinion, is like coffee. You have to have it often, and the taste grows on you. I was just happy that this was served after my lunch break. Head Cheese for breakfast is asking a lot. Next, I tasted Spiced Seven-hour Braised Leg of Lamb. Both tastings were served with Chateau Pradeaux Bandol Rouge (2002). After amazing tastes from equally amazing chefs, I went to a seminar on cheese by Ihsan Gurdal, a fine cheese, meats and specialty food purveyor. He travels the world to find amazing products to sell in the U.S. I never realized how competitive and tricky his business can be. It makes sense. When a small cheese maker in a tiny village in France has a small amount of cheese to sell, you have to have an amazing connection with that farmer in order to get him to sell to you. It was an eye opening talk, and tasting cheese and wine during was icing on the cake! To end the evening, Chef Scott Conant prepared an amazing meal for a small number of us in a private room at Alto. Of course, the food was amazing, but I loved the fact that during the cocktail hour Veuve Cliquot Rose was being served. What better way to start a meal? (FYI, Veuve Cliquot is one of my favorite things in the world.)
There are a couple of possible solutions to these DDR4 signal-integrity challenges. The first and simplest solution is to allow only one DIMM slot per DDR4 memory channel and allow only single-rank DDR4 DIMMs. The problem with this solution is that it increases the number of SoC memory channels for a given memory capacity and thus drives up the SoC’s pin count, cost, and board-level real estate.
I love going to visit her except for one thing. She’s a feeder. She’s a pusher of the food variety. She insists that I don’t eat enough. She scowls at my portion sizes and insists I have seconds and then thirds. It’s ironic really that this tiny slip of a woman eats bigger portions than me. How cruel is that?!! You may be skeptical and believe that at night I slip into the kitchen and eat a family pack of Mars bars to myself. Alas I would LOVE to be able to tell you that my excess weight is due to binge eating. I would love it because if that was the case it would be possible for me to slim. It’s not the case however. Yes I do eat chocolate and biscuits but hardly ever in excess. Not enough to account for the extra weight I carry. Unfortunately due to a combination of a medication I have to take daily and a wonky polycystic right ovary no matter how much salad I eat, no matter how many kilometers I walk in a week my weight frustratingly stays exactly the same. Exactly. So I guess this blog is about my journey towards learning to love the body I’m in because I’m stuck with it. I will however, continue my research on how I can transplant my brain into Jennifer Lopez’s body. That is one endevour I won’t give up on!
Am I over-analysing? Do I have a drink problem? I should be the one in control, not the wine, so I guess that makes it one, if it’s a problem to me.

After a time, though, even the fights become so absurd that they lose their splendor. The endless parade of kicks, stabs and gunfire turns what would started out as a brilliantly stripped-down effort into a variant of the Simpsons rake gag with internal bleeding. Indeed, the sequences eventually turn downright comical in their interminable length. Nowhere is this more evident than when Uwais and Ruhian, so excellent in their isolated scenes, come together for a climactic fight that drags on for so long I kept expecting a bikini-clad woman to occasionally walk in front of the camera brandishing a round number on a sign. And though the matching concrete floors and walls facilitate some clever axis inversion on Evans' part as his camera bucks and turns, the drab uniformity of the slum building only makes the parade of martial arts moves more repetitive and droning.

Richard Nixon kicked off his historic comeback in 1966 with a column on the South (by this writer) that declared we would build our Republican Party on a foundation of states' rights, human rights, small government, and a strong national defense, and leave it to the "party of Maddox, Mahoney, and Wallace to squeeze the last ounces of political juice out of the rotting fruit of racial injustice."

It is now safe to tell you about an exciting mission that took me and two friends deep into the shady heart of 1940s Vienna...
Something had changed over the last week, since I’ve left. I’m not sure whether it was the fact that I was leaving everything behind and testing my strength, or whether it was because I realised that it would have never have worked out anyway; maybe I went back for the wrong reasons. Either way, I’ve somehow installed this personality that knows that it wants and doesn’t give two hoots about who tries to get in the way of that. My confidence levels have shot through the roof and I don’t hate anyone anymore. Hate is wasted on the insecure. It feels so good knowing that I will get what I want and I can give it everything. Not everyone in the world became successful from within this business. Yes, I will have to work a lot harder and fight some harder battles, but it will happen.

Kaleb has some medical issues. He has a Gtube, an inguinal hernia; he has had cardiac problems, and has only one kidney. But more than all that, Kaleb is strong, he encourages others with his beautiful smile and he is a fighter. He is our little miracle, our little “Pumpkin”; he is our very own STORY OF FAITH and the greatest present any mother could ever ask for.
Having packed up it didn’t take me long to get a lift back to Glencoe with a girl with a delightful Scottish accent (she must have taken pity on me because there had just been a brief shower!) Ken, who’d driven there to get some wine and beer for the meal that I had by now confirmed, met me where I was dropped off.
Part of my problem, I realize, is that I really want to understand the news. I want accuracy, not just speed. I want, dare I say it, context, not just headlines. I want, in other words, what TV news is not designed to deliver.
There was a time when Tim Burton was one of my favourite directors. But things took a turn around about his remake of Planet of the Apes. Personally I don’t think he’s lost his talent, as at the very least he has one or two moments that shine, but I think he’s become very comfortable in what he does and doesn’t want to push himself. However in Dark Shadows I saw the potential to push him self once more; sure the first trailer didn’t fill me with hope but I was still hopeful.
Here’s what this means in the world of kidneys: He can still get this next chemo, which is scheduled to start on Thursday, but it needs to be further dose-modified. If his GFR dips below 30, which we assume it will next month, he either has to stop this particular drug or (maybe — this hasn’t been confirmed yet by his docs but it makes sense to me) get dialyzed after each dose. We’ve already explored the possibility of doing only two of the three drugs in his protocol but have been told that their effectiveness lies in the specific combination and leaving one out would render any of them much less useful. So it’s sort of an all-or-nothing thing: either we stop chemo altogether or we continue and add dialysis to the mix.
“This method has excellent benefits, because it may encourage retailers to stock and sell your book, because the risk is transferred back to you.

For the sake of clarity, this concept is not usually stated so harshly, or so clearly. The basic idea is that our thoughts create our reality, right? So if we accept as inevitable a family history of heart disease, then we create the possibility of it existing for us. Conversely, if we were to not accept it, then it won't happen to us. Everything exists because we manifest it.

The open air pool, which doesn't use much chlorine, is the main feature with charming changing rooms and showers and alongside is the glass fronted bar and restaurant. Being quite a prude, I was a little self conscious of showing off an eight month baby bump, in a much too tight swim suit, in front of people eating their lunch! But no one seemed to notice - even as I squealed with cold, it certainly didn't feel like the 24 degrees it was meant to be.
This is simply a chicken tortilla which is topped with the ensalada(cabbage) that compliments most meals. Like many dishes in Nicaragua, the chicken is deep-fried in corn oil. I recently asked a woman who was frying plantains if she ever uses olive oil. She said:
Not a great deal going on in the house but I was really excited to get in some pieces from my statuary/planter line. Can I just tell you how gorgeous these pieces are!! Anyone who has ordered these has been so delighted with their purchase, saying how they are even prettier in person and that is so true! I love the look of old stone planters and statuary but the beauty of these is that they are a fiberglass/resin composite so you can lift them with one hand! There are some cheap imitations which are pretty bad but the quality of this line is bar none.
I couldn't help but notice that Gregory Dark seem to share Rinse Dream's disdain for the audience's erection. The way Mr. Dark would insert shots of Jack Baker carrying on like the demented jackass that he is during the sex scenes has led me to believe that the crafty filmmaker would rather be concentrating on the film's story. And let's face it, if it weren't for the crazy hairstyles, chichi handwear, and scrumptious lingerie the sex would have been unbearable.

Each success should be savored. Roll that thing in your mouth like a big piece of sweet hard candy –the good kind not the kind nobody likes –and instead of crunching through it and swallowing it, let it slowly melt before you reach for the next piece.
The kingdom of heaven is mysterious: There is no telling when we will brush up against true Kingdom. We might be in the middle of our everyday tasks and run upon a move of God that is unlike anything we have ever seen before. We might simply be walking home, and over there in the corner of a yard under a tree, where we least expected it, will be something more valuable than anything we have. We just thought it was another hum-drum day, but this is the day that changes our life.

Then I used my immersion blender to puree the sauce for a smoother consistency. You can also use a blender or food processor for this step if you don't have an immersion blender. Or...get an immersion blender! I love mine. No need to worry about transfering the hot sauce from the crock pot to another appliance when you've got an immersion blender, you just stick the immersion blender in and tah-dah- smooth sauce in seconds! Best of all, you won't create more dirty dishes. Who wants to take apart and wash a blender? Invest in one of these instead: Cuisinart CSB-76BC SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, Brushed Chrome (See all Hand Blenders) I use mine all of the time for soups, sauces, salad dressing, and smoothies. I love it!

Charlotte has also recently started eating solid foods. Before she was born I thought for sure I'd be the mom to make her own baby food. And then she was born and I went months without getting any sleep and then I went back to work (and still don't get uninterrupted sleep). Needless to say, I don't actually make her food. I buy organic Earth's Best because it is so much easier. But mom guilt still tries to get the best of me by making me feel bad for not making Char's food. I try to tell myself it's okay to buy her food (It's organic. That counts for something, right?) instead of making it because that just gives me more time to spend with her. But to be honest, I'm just too tired to make her food and there are just not enough hours in the day to do it all.

Today, we hear a lot about being like Jesus or being “Christ-like”. There’s even a song written by Rich Mullins called “It’s Hard to be Like Jesus”. Preachers, and consequently believers, talk about Christ-likeness. As individual believers we are told that this is our goal; to be like Christ.
3. On the other hand, I have not been able to match the number of books going out of this house with the number of books coming in. This is a cardinal rule in the library business.

First off, question your assumptions. High school does not look the same for every student, and the high school years will not look the same for every unschooler. Some end up taking some courses. Some get intrigued by a subject and read college-level textbooks that Mom found for $1 on the clearance shelf at Half Price Books that have been gathering dust on the shelf at home for more than a year. Some learn skills on their own by following interests that lead them into jobs that become careers. And some do a combination of these.

The global war, which should be called the Third World War due to the number of fronts and countries being attacked by the Zionist Axis, has killed more people than the number of Jews alleged to have been killed by Hitler. Unlike the Shoah færy tale with its mythical gas chambers, lampshades and soap, the holocaust of Libyans, Iraqis, Afghans, Somalis, Serbians, etc etc is real. The true figure of Jewish deaths in the Second World War (from all causes, mostly natural or US/UK inflicted, but excluding those fighting in the Wehrmacht), was fewer than those murdered by Bomber Harris' terrorist RAF raids on Dresden. The Muslim world is more aware of this reality than the cowed and zionised nations of Europe and the west.

He just wants what is rightfully his, what he’s earned through the years. He’s a very proud yet humble man, qualities to be admired. He wants to make a living through his remaining years through the music that he loves, nothing more and nothing less. He wants to get away from the need for help from Sweet Relief. He wants to STAND on his own two feet, and get the world to perk up its ears and listen to what he has to play and sing.

The day after we got back, it was cleaning and prepping for Passover, followed by cooking the day after. And what do you know, I got sick (probably from the plane ride) and had to do all of that work while feeling pretty crumby. Instead of taking it easy, I opted to run a 10k race, which made me even worse, keeping me out of commission from exercise and cooking for over a week. I was even sick on my birthday ( April 9th – in case you need to send me a belated gift). Instead of birthday cake (even the Passover kind), I was eating whole wheat matzah with avocado, tomato, and cucumbers. Even though it was tasty, it wasn’t exactly how I wanted to celebrate.

Another factor they should consider is the details in the apparel and accessory they wear. These can influence their over-all look.

Someone had cut the padlock that secured the door of our unit and had dumped all of my Christmas decorations on the floor. After the initial shock wore off, Sverre and I concluded that they must have been drug addicts, or someone like that, for nothing of value was taken. The old laptops, the winter barn jackets, the sled...nothing that could have been easily transported and sold was gone. Instead, all that was missing was a box full of cheap Christmas decorations from Nille, the Norwegian equivalent of the dollar store.
I told my grandmothers just how delicious it was, knowing that neither of them would be impressed since they both thought of lobster as ‘trash food’.
In this year's version, the habaneros (100, including 15 donated by a proud guy sitting at the bar last night) are the first thing you notice, like a punch in the mouth. I braced, imagining that this was only the first wave, with pain and awe to follow. Remarkably, the heat died and the sweeter stout came forward. It didn't spark going down, and it didn't collect on my palate; but to the last sip, the first contact always brought a shock to my tongue like static electricity.
In Bree, you must listen to the Fireworks Announcer and fire off the correct rocket. You’ll also find a few Hobbits who ask that you find good places to shoot fireworks to drum up support for the shows. If you participated in the Treasure Hunt event and remember the berry-gathering quest, then you’ll get a sense of how irritating of a quest those Hobbits send you on.
My next step is to get exercising again. It can't be a marathon, or a run at all for that matter. I can’t do anything high impact - it must be strictly non-weight bearing or it causes flare-ups - and I can’t push myself too hard or too fast for the same reasons. I can’t afford to mask pain so I will listen to my body. I know from experience that all it takes to promote those endorphins is moderate amounts of exercise to get effects.
Woo hoo… A new post! I should be writing this in my knitting blog, but I’ve just not had any inclination to write for that blog in a long time. In total, I have three blogs now, and it’s a bit overwhelming for me right now.

That took time, but on the plus side, all the blogs I did sign onto are ones I will truly enjoy re-visiting.

I had a fitness conference all day on Saturday in San Antonio. Normally I'm super pumped to spend a whole day doing fitness stuff, but this year I just felt bad about spending a weekend day away from my girl. It's bad enough I don't get to see her very much Mon-Fri, but when you add a weekend day on top of that it's just plain awful. So instead of fully enjoying my fitness conference, part of me felt super guilty for not being with her. Luckily, I got to take yesterday off and I spent lots of time giving my baby extra snuggles.

So now this week, here I was knowing I was about to write the end of Book Three. But everything was different this time. The scene was outlined. I knew exactly what would happen and how. I had had my eureka moment about a week earlier when it became suddenly clear to me that what I thought would be the final scene wasn't right and that something else needed to be there instead. That was exciting. But now here I was, needing to write the last 1,500 words and...I just wasn't doing it. For a couple of days I came up with all sorts of excuses -- it was the weekend, my son is home from uni and he might need me, I have to call my parents, etc etc. Then on Tuesday I had a quiet day to myself at home and I knew this was it. This was the time to get it done. But first I had to sharpen my pencil. Then I had to unload the dishwasher. Then I even had to check Facebook one more time. That's when I knew I was in trouble. So I got out my old bag of tricks and tricked myself into sitting down. Deciding I wouldn't write, I would just reread the last thing I had written. That was enough to get me there. And then, two hours later, I was done. Did I cry? No. Did I punch my fist into the air and shout Yes! ? No. Did I run around the flat doing a happy dance? Not even that. I did...nothing. I felt...shamefully blasé. My first reaction was "Okay, good. That's done. Now I need to do......." but then when I realised that was what I was feeling, I started to worry. What does this mean that I'm not crying and excited? Is it rubbish? Is it boring? Will I have to trash the whole thing and start again? And if I do, what then? What about all the plans I've made, people I've told? Oy. What a headcase I can be.
Remember, hyperlinks to pointless unedited text are great, but really long strings of URL gibberish that make reader's browser display funny because they run off the page are always better. When in doubt, it's best to just paste thousands of words in one big undifferentiated paragraph right in there like a texty skyscraper of unanswerable intellectual doom. Otherwise no one might read it.

1. Describe the beer in what it looks like, smells like and tastes like using no more than 3 words for each area
Then on Saturday, Preston participated in his first Pinewood Derby race and made it to the District race. He was so excited. He got a little trophy and is so proud of that thing. He named his car "The Rook" which I thought was appropriate as it was his first race. You know, a Rookie?
SNL returns for Season 37. No cast changes, with the exception of Nasim Pedrad being promoted to repertory player. Alec Baldwin hosts for a 16th time, breaking the record for most all-time he had shared with Steve Martin.

As for critics, there are some I admire and take seriously and others who are idiots and I just dismiss.
Not so in the medieval times, where the religions, their faith, and especially the status of scripture and prophets were in focus. And, of course, there were no Israel-Palestine conflict back then. Most of the Muslim polemics were actually focused on Christianity and their religious claims, though they often also lead to reactions to Judaism and the Jews. See for example Ibn Hazm, who is one of the more known polemicists.
Mass Effect 3 is a third person shooter with simple RPG elements and weapon customization. Shepard is the leader of a squad of three. You can choose two AI controlled crew members to take on missions. There is an emphasis on conversations between characters leading into huge amounts of dialog. The choices you make influences how major or minor events will play out.
I've been working on my photography skills. I've had this fancy- smancy camera for a few years now, and have never used it up to it's full potential. This year, I've made it my mission to get learn all that it has to offer. This week I have been playing with my "focal" settings.

Talking of which: Ken Livingstone – Labour. Fucking hell. No way. Complete hypocrite, anti-semitic mental wanker. Oh a liar too. Tax dodger and newt fucker (poor things split before he even gets the jollies on!). You want a man who fucks newts up the arse to control your tube? (no doubt he’ll be very keen to see lots of anal sex for small animals and pre-pubescent children) He’s so far up the unions arse that he can see out of their collective and deluded arse.
ON REFLECTION
I think I can make it more real by defining that worm. It is from the Greek word skolex that means maggot.
As I mentioned yesterday, as part of this month's challenge I have recruited the help of a few guest bloggers to share some new information for us to learn about. The one you'll meet today is a friend of mine from college, and I am so excited about what she has to share with us. Please welcome Andrea!
I've loved this band right from the off, having seen their first UK show at the Metro Club in Oxford Street. I was blown away with their enthusiasm and sheer electric showmanship, and for a while they were the darlings of the music press, set to be the band that The Strokes never quite became. They disappeared from the radar of the music press pretty quickly, but I've always kept a keen eye on their career. Stir The Blood is the Bravery's third album, and much like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, there is a real maturity and sophistication to the sound on this outing. They are also experimenting a little more electronically, and the result is pure dynamite!
That won't be a normal thing once I get settled in; I've just got lots I need to do while I'm getting up to speed, and I lose track of time etc...
Well I had high hopes for filling last week with interesting blogs and book reviews (thrilling!) but then my life just spiraled into oblivion and soon I was on a plane to Seattle, napping on Kamel's shoulder.

But as Whitehead and his organization sponsored a legal action aimed at crippling a president, it would seem reasonable to trace the trajectory of Whitehead’s ideas and his career. In this case, there is a fairly straight-forward story about his theocratic ideological roots. The story can be found in Whitehead’s books and speeches, those of his close colleagues and founding documents of the Rutherford Institute.

After we moved here and decided (months later) to let our cats outside (they were inside-only for the first two years of their lives) Clark stayed out one night - we couldn't find him - and the next morning he was out back looking like he felt horrible. He could barely walk, was shaky, didn't want to eat or drink, and all those lovely things. We took him to the vet and the result was like what just happened but it had been longer since he lost the fight so he was worse off - his temperature was 105.
So I am going to have to dedicate this post to my best friends John and Lauren. Quite simply because they tell me all my dating stories are so comical and classic that I should write a book. I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but there have been some comical points to my dating life. I mean I have dated A lot, and when I say a lot I mean a lot. I once went an entire weekend without buying or cooking my own food for any meal for 3 days strait. Except maybe breakfast on one of those days, but hey I’m a sucker for some oatmeal with a banana. I got the nickname at work of 50 first dates because of all the dates I went out on and then never spoke to the person ever again.

The china set has service for eight. There are a few missing teacups but everything else is in beautiful condition. I'm estimating the china to be from the late 1930's to early 1940's but I'm going to have to do some sleuthing up the family tree to know for sure.
At last, I presented my Java project in class. It was a joyous event where I got to feel smarter than everyone else for a brief period of time. My teacher was most impressed by my programming skills and even more by my deep and archaic knowledge of elementary level grammar.

1) Fruits and veggies. (duh)
To the heterosexuals – If you’re heterosexual, you NEED to become comfortable with the opposite sex’s genitals and all that comes with them. Masturbation, morning erections, menstruation, nocturnal emissions, cramps, erectile dysfunction, hormonal cycles, feminine hygiene products, odors – you name it. And the more comfortable you become with it all – the better you’re going to be as a partner AND a lover.

Indeed, the most growth in abortions is occurring among the Hispanic population in America, not our comparable-to-Europe segments of the population. He also went on to point out that you can find microcosms of these ideas in American itself. The American Northeast is fairly secular, and yet New York has a 40% rate of abortions among all children conceived in the city.

In these moments, it is difficult if not seemingly impossible to back up, take a breath, and assume positive intent. After all, what positive thing could a child be trying to do if they throw something or yell at you, or if they show emotions such as anger, frustration, and sadness? Well, there are a number of possibilities:
Injectable and oral forms of supplements are available. The injectable types may be more useful for those with deficiencies due to problems with absorption. B complex products vary in terms of components and dose level contained within them.

As we got to the taxi stand, my heart lifted a bit as there were people waiting. FB explained that I was in labor and could I please have the next cab. No one said yes or no, they just ignored us. Thanks friendly people of the 6th arrondissement! (insert massive eye roll) After waiting a few minutes, I spied a cab letting people out across the street outside the famous Café de Flore and told FB to run for it. I ran across the street after him holding my giant belly yelling (in French) "I'M IN LABOR, I'M IN LABOR!! PLEASE GIVE ME THAT CAB!!" I arrived just in time to have two young men cut in front of me, get in the cab, slam the door shut and give me the "too bad for you" shrug as the cab sped off.

So, when I have managed to find a spare few hours to fully immerse myself in writing, reading and watching, what have I been up to? Brainstorming mostly. Ideas have been coming thick and fast so there has been a lot of planning and drafting going on rather than actually creating, but of course this is a preliminary step in the right direction. Nobody of serious means can just plow straight into creating simply for the sake of creating, because as soon as they do, they will quickly find themselves at the point where their idea has no direction and for their own gratification only. The result of which will be bad writing and a waste of the time I am clawing away to find in the first place.
But it does show how silly this is all getting, with Bob grasping at anything no matter how flimsy to try to ”win”. The whole point that I am making, and which Bob seems not to grasp, is that none of this is magisterial. The opinion of these editors is not magisterial. Period. They have no office in the Church, no commission from the Church, no sanction from the Church, no explicit endorsement from the Church. Their contention that the seventeenth century documents concerning Copernicanism proceeded from the “Roman Pontiffs” is just their opinion and has no authority. There were plenty of other Catholics during that same period pointing out what I and others have pointed out more recently, namely, that the position against Copernicanism “(a) was promulgated only in disciplinary documents, not in formally doctrinal ones; (b) was never promulgated directly and personally by any Pope, only indirectly, through the instrumentality of the Vatican Congregations of the Index and the Holy Office” (Fr. Brian Harrison, Roma Locuta Est - Causa Finita Est).
Prayer is a way to be with the divine — from the prayer born from need, where we use words to express our needs, to the deeper prayer that takes us beyond any words into the oneness and silence within the heart. This video is about the simplicity of the “Prayer of the Heart”:

Here are the possible tradeable cards that I picked up with the five. The 2009 Jay Bruce Upper Deck Starquest is the black ultra rare parallel. The one I might keep is the 2004 Fleer Announcing Greats Jon Miller featuring Cal Ripken. I like Jon Miller more than most because I never got to go to a ballpark and hear a home announcer, so ESPN Sunday Night Baseball was my home game and Miller's voice just means baseball to me. The final card is a 2006 Topps Heritage chrome refractor Jose Castillo. I am not a fan of the Pirates and I think the 1957 Topps design is among the worst ever for Topps sets, so I am not real sure why I chose this card. But I did so now it is up for grabs.

Let's face it. Writing fiction is not only difficult in all the technical aspects, but it is difficult emotionally as well. You really DO care about what people think. You're putting your creativity out there to be scrutinized and critiqued, ignored and praised. Most of the time conflicting emotions abound.
Who was pretty fair about evenly taking turns between the two types of stories. In the second season there was more of an emphasis on the sci-fi, even though from today’s vantage point, the historical tales of the Hartnell era seem to be the ones that hold up better. When the show wasn’t featuring the Daleks, its sci-fi wasn’t as strong, which speaks to how tight of a concept the Daleks really were way back then. But since sci-fi is an ever-evolving artform, it dates itself in ways that these old historical stories tend not to. Back in 1964, “The Sensorites” probably seemed like a pretty cool story, especially to
A bit earlier, I mentioned Maths, and how EEVL expanded to include that subject when we joined the RDN. When it comes to information resources, maths is a peculiar subject. What we found was that the EEVL Internet resource catalogue was fairly good at directing non-mathematicians towards quality maths resources, but almost completely useless at directing mathematicians towards relevant resources.

Unlike the UN Security Council, no country has a veto right at the 193-member-strong UN General Assembly. However, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding and only serve as recommendations to the UN Security Council. This makes Thursday’s document more symbolic than policy making.

Blair’s comments came after The Washington Post reported that US President Barack Obama had embraced predecessor George W Bush’s policy of authorising the killing of US citizens involved in terrorist activities overseas.
On Wednesday the White House released an Executive Order in response to ongoing developments in Yemen. Declaring a national emergency to deal with Yemen's "unusual and extraordinary threat" to America's national security, President Barack Obama has threatened to initiate financial sanctions against any party that "obstructs the implementation" of the Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) power-sharing agreement. Except the administration's decision rests not on the foundation of democracy, but on the unstable base of hypocrisy and neo-imperialism.

Despite the fact that the last time I've ever "performed" in front of an audience was in the 3rd grade dressed up as a spider with a trumpet, I absolutely had to go. Vagina? Monologues? Females only? Hmm. Mangina, check. Shit to monologue about, check. Female, - federally? Sure! Check. Manginas have monologues, too. The way I figger it, the history of Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues is rooted in using this verbatim theatre to challenge taboos around sexuality and to heighten sexual empowerment. And this has stemmed to trans women also, with pieces like They Tried to Beat the Girl Out of my Boy (and Calpernia Adam's Beautiful Daughters, which explores the trans female experience). So what about actively challenging prejudice and discrimination when it comes to trans men, also?
STORYLINE
Light Bulb Alley is a three piece Rock band that formed in 2007 in Montreal. The band draws upon 60s Garage Rock, 70s Punk and newer groups such as King Khan & BBQ Show for their influences. Fronted by Allister Booth on vocals and guitar, Karlo Sno on bass and Ockert Greeff this three piece band played for a few years in Montreal building up a fan base. After about three years, Light Bulb Alley signed to Ricochet Sound a label that also features music from Montreal’s Garage Rock legends The Gruesomes, The Hook Up, The Gerry Alvarez Odyssey and Fuad & The Feztones. In 2011, the band recorded and released their album The Sound of Things. The sound on the album can be best described as “Swampy, Punk, Psychedelic, Live, Country, Blues, Trash. Melodic, & Dirty jingles to listen to on your rocking chair! “ as stated in the bands biography on their official website. The album contains songs such as “Pepper Spray”, “Long Time Coming” and reworked version of Bo Diddley’s “Who Do You Love?’ which puts the songs into a new context. Recently the group added a new drummer Sébastien de Champlain to their line up.

As I was driving to the hotel I checked to see where is the closest Five Guys. I could SO go for a good burger right now. You know how far? 870 miles. Honest to God. I mentioned it to the people at the front desk and one of them had never even heard of Five Guys, and the other person (who had lived in DC) said the closest is in Colorado. Really? Crazy....
1) Kitchenaid Mixer. If you bake, she makes life feel like a cool breeze on a hot summer day.

In this segment of the Thoroughbreds for All symposium, we see three riders (Eric Dierks, Kerry Blackmer, and Steuart Pittman) from the Retired Racehorse Training Challenge in an even-more-challenging situation. They each hop up on an unfamiliar, fresh-off-the-track, OTTB in a very charged situation, and they ride them. The horses are typical just off the track condition — while they’ve had a bit of let-down time, they have not been in regular horse tack, retraining has not yet begun. As if that’s not enuf, there are are probably 200 people in bleachers watching, clapping, laughing, talking–oh, and a loud microphone with occasional feedback.

The national media has been quick to pick up on this story and has been decidedly anti-Petrino (a quick Google search on ‘Bobby Petrino’ will confirm this). Perhaps neither of those facts is very surprising—our culture (and by extension, the media) is always interested in a juicy story about the misdeeds or failure of public figures, and Bobby Petrino has never been very popular with the media anyway (ESPN’s Pat Forde has been on a personal crusade against him for years).
Again, roller coaster ride. Something that has happened all through this pregnancy. When do we finally get a break? Got to the office and we were taken in quickly. First step was an internal (ugh) and she always did different tests to be sure something else wasn't causing the bleeding & cramping. OMG I really don't think the speculum (sp?) has ever hurt so much in my life! At this point she felt everything was caused by remaining tissue from Baby B ... man you have no idea how much it kills me to say that. Next the u/s machine was flipped on and our little man was wiggling all over the place. If I didn't know better I'd think he was saying "nah nah gotcha!". Everything was checked and it was bascially - seeing *nothing* was good news.

In this case, the job had been planned for a while. New heating/air-con for the office, and because the contractors were pushed for time, or didn't like heights, or something, and didn't want to take the old outdoor units down, or fix the structure for the new ones, I apparently volunteered to do it. Amazing the number of things I volunteer for without being aware of them. So this morning, first job was a bit of snow clearing and gritting, by which time the big green thing was warmed up and ready to go.

Having some final work duties to perform I left the Museum on foot with my colleague Renato Grieco and we enjoyed a brisk walk back to the Schweizerhof as the first drops of rain fell on Lucerne. Tomorrow would be upon us sooner than we’d know. Upon entering my bedroom I noticed the red backpack with prominent logos of the Swiss Convention and Incentive Bureau (SCIB) and Ovation. What a thoughtful and useful gift! Beside it was a nice presentation from Luzern Tourismus, along with a precious bagful of delectable chocolates from the workshop of Max Chocolatier, a boutique producer with a retail store adjacent to my hotel. If Tolstoy were alive he’d certainly give a shout out to this most stunning shop with a commitment to “experience chocolate for the first time”.
What stands out in my mind is what Luke recorded in his gospel in 24:39. These words are directly from the mouth of the Lord, “Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself, handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.” Those who deny the physical resurrection are calling Jesus Christ a liar.
Next, we need to be mindful of when we are resistant to change. This is extremely hard for us as adults, as taking a step back during our own thinking process is a difficult task. Simply ask yourself, “am I making this choice because I believe it is the best one I could make, or am I making this choice because it is the easiest one for me to accept.” Something that is easy to accept causes less dissonance, but dissonance occurs because you have something conflicting with your constructs. When you get that feeling of dissoance, try to find out way, and please… do not be afraid to admit your faults.

No - it's the ability to hold all the plot threads in the reader's mind and cope with the incidental spirallings of imagination along the way. The invention is just too prolific.

However, on night of the event, the store actually sells only 43 copies of the book (which is actually a higher than average number for an event), which brings in $1072.85 (43 x $24.95, the cover price of the book). The author signs another 30 for stock, and the bookstore returns the rest. We're assuming that the 30 he just signed for stock will sell, by the way. They usually do. So that another $748.50; gross earnings for the night = $1821.35. Now let's adjust the expenditures to account for the books returned: 73 books x $13.18 = $962.14 + $400 for promotion and $72 for the employees. Total actual cost of this event = $1434.14.
I am annoyed that because of the intensity of first 7 episodes, giving the last episode a kind of “breather” feeling did mess up the ending to a certain extent. If I were to consider an alternate ending to the series it would be one more full of drama and sorrow just like the other 7 episodes in the series have been, but again I could not say whether that ending would have been better or worse. I might give it a few days to consider my feeling further but right now I am still confused.

Archiving the mundane doings of millers and merchants was tedious, but at least it was safe. As Arki heads off on a mysterious mission into parts unknown, in the company of the coarse, bloody-minded Syldoon, he is promised a chance to finally record an historic adventure well worth the telling, but first he must survive the experience!

New Year's is upon us, and of course so is another feast. In my family you 'go big or go home' as the Americans say and as we haven't cooked a big meal ourselves yet all of Christmas we are taking over New Year's instead with a big turkey dinner England style which is tradition here for this holiday.

Now, after nearly two decades under the gentle administrations from the greedy kleptocrats at the ruling African National Congress, the country’s crucial clinical research sector is in such serious decline that only 0,15 percent of the entire health care budget now gets allocated to health-related research and development projects – instead of the 20 percent required to help educate the next generation of clinical researchers, warns the Academy of Science of SA (ASSAF) in a little-noticed report , published on April 22.

There is also the important fact that you can't see the back of the building, and the north side only partially, and that much only with some effort. One can always wave a hand and say, "Maybe the house looks different from the back, like it was only partially remodeled or something. The conservatory and the ballroom with its big windows and French doors? Back there somewhere, on the other side of the house." I think many people find that to be a perfectly satisfactory explanation, if the question occurs to them at all.

Staying ahead of the next step of the journey as each new procedure or treatment came upon me. I exhaustively researched the “what comes next…what to expect…what can be done to minimize adverse effects.” I found ways to go through chemo without most of the side effects (with the support of my brother who embraces integrative medicine) and with my nutrition support and nutrition IVs and peptide injections. I used cold caps to preserve my hair. They were a challenge: 33 degrees below zero, they froze my hair follicles so chemo couldn’t get in. Every 3 weeks for months, I would wear those cold caps for at least 6 hours. It was uncomfortable and unpleasant, on top of the chemo, but we managed to laugh through a lot of that because the distraction from the cold helped.

Last week is a week I hope I'll never have to repeat. Ever. Everything was going swimmingly on Monday - I even managed to sneakily cut two more Swoon blocks while my kids were happily playing. We have school holidays happening in our neck of the woods for another 5 weeks or so, so my daytime sewing time is rare, and this does NOT happen very often - the kids-happily-playing-and-me-quilting thing. Anyhoo, I managed to get both the blocks cut, and then sewed all my HSTs and flying geese together that night.

Non-commercial, marginalized blogger that I am, I wistfully admire the cool professional work done every day by professional journalists, particularly those who cover the New York City political scene. And, as they work hard, this fortunate group also enjoy the opportunity to play hard, as members of the Inner Circle, an organization of NYC reporters and journalists, that annually puts on a black tie event, the Inner Circle Dinner, at which they trenchantly satirize the City of New York powers that be, and are answered, in kind, in a theatrical performance by the Mayor and his (and no doubt some day, her) own inner government circle of advisors and minions. Although I have never attended, I am always fascinated to learn about this event. This year, I was pleased to learn that veteran NYC political reporter Dominic Carter---who had, through a series of unfortunate personal and legal issues, experienced a fall from grace, but who apparently has now resolved/recovered/re-emerged, and is back on the NYC scene as a reporter for RNN-TV and newsblogs---will appear in this year's Inner Circle show, "Pre-Occupied", performing as former GOP Presidential candidate Herman Cain.

As a traditional psychotherapist, Dr. Brian Weiss was astonished and skeptical when one of his patients began recalling past-life traumas that seemed to hold the key to her recurring nightmares and anxiety attacks. His skepticism was eroded, however, when she began to channel messages from “the space between lives,” which contained remarkable revelations about Dr. Weiss’s family and his deceased son. Using past-life therapy, he was able to cure the patient and embark on a new, more meaningful phase of his own career.

Dogs come and go in our lives. They live such short lives compared to us, spanning a time when little may change or much may change in the rhythm of our own daily lives. Perhaps the loss of canine companions in some way prepares us for the loss of other loved ones, and reminds us that nothing is permanent. Their constant loyalty and devotion also serve as a reminder, that life is short, and we’d best love unconditionally with all the energy we can muster in order to enjoy life and bring happiness to others. Ask a dog: what else is life for?

Another visitor, Alf Doten, was less impressed. Arriving one October night in 1862, he and a friend dined and slept in the tavern. The next day, Doten gave it a scathing review in his private journal:
“Too often the discussion about women’s choices (stay at home, go back to work) ignores the role of fathers. To achieve meaningful equality, we need to push for a society that values fathers who strike a balance between their career and their family life too. Women shouldn’t have to be equally uninvolved parents to reach their goals; they should be able to ask their spouses to step up too.”

She stalled at some traffic lights, and whilst re starting the car, three other cars honked their horns and overtook on not only the wrong side of the road, but a traffic island too. She remained calm, I became incensed at the other drivers. She stalled, she did not drive in to someone elses car, she did not drive across a crossing with people on it. However, you were the ones breaking the law and endangering peoples lives.
It feels weird, usually I am desperate to get everything done, and can never get on top of anything because I am running around after the kids, but today, I can get things done and have been looking forward to getting things done, but it is too quiet. Crazy really, is there just no pleasing me??!

The most crucial problem is price. There is no unified world gas market and enormous Asian demand—not only from a hungry China, but also from traditional exporters like Indonesia, Malaysia, and even UAE and Saudi Arabia, who’ve crippled their domestic sectors with consumer subsidies—means it’s a sellers’ market. So while prices might be astonishingly low in the self-sufficient US, they’re almost seven times higher in India and higher still in Japan (cue the F-word: Fukushima). This means in India coal is still far cheaper and more attractive.

If you are one of the unlucky-lucky ones, there will come a time in your life when you will experience great emotional pain, and/or immense inner conflict as a result of the loss of a loved one or some other major life crisis. With this great pain can emerge the catalyst for embarking on a journey towards personal development, maturation, and eventually, for a few chosen ones, self-actualization. That is, becoming the person you were meant to be.

Then there’s the local white witch, Miss Hawthorne, played to utterly kooky perfection by Damaris Hayman, a character that’s sort of emblematic of how much fun this story is. Another great character is Professor Horner, played by Robin Wentworth. He only appears in Episode One, but every single utterance that comes out of his mouth is priceless. It’s almost a shame he wasn’t kept around for the rest of the story. Words escape me for how perfect Roger Delgado is here. But then, words always escape me for how good he was as the Master. There have been many Doctors, and there have many fine debates over which is the best, but anyone, with any amount of taste, must surely admit that Delgado’s Master has never been bested

I experimented on various types of laces - cotton was fantastic, but boy did it soak in the paint and the colours were extremely vibrant. When it came to my favourite choice of lace, guipure, I opted to water the mixture right down and the results were perfect, still maintaining the shimmer. Of course for my project for Creative Inspiration Paints, I used a brighter hue than my normal tastes, as I really wanted the colours to show in my blog posts. I must add, I certainly am not disappointed that I opted for the brighter version!

Old man winter has finally stopped by to pay Dallas a visit and I thought it’d be a great opportunity to bust out the crock pot and make some chili and cornbread.

And other than baking and shredding the chicken, the most effort I exerted in putting this together was opening a can or bag and dumping it in!

For know this, everything that you know now in your life today will soon be an upturned. Much of what you have grown accustomed to will no longer be the way.

Many of you have done this many times before, for it is just as it was long ago and again similar today.

Pause for a few seconds after your exhalation, relaxing the abdomen. Then, keeping your throat open, allow the inhalation to flow in through the nose. Because of the stronger exhalation, you should be able to feel the inhalation being drawn down effortlessly into the lower chest. Count the length of the exhalation, the pause, and the inhalation. At first, try to make the exhalation at least as long as the inhalation; do this by shortening your inhalation, as in the previous exercise. (Unlike the previous exercise, in which you breathe at your normal resting rate, your breath here will be both longer and stronger.) Eventually, aim to make your exhalation more than twice as long as the inhalation and to make the pause after the exhalation comfortable rather than hurried. Since asthmatics find exhalation difficult, it may help you to imagine the exhalation flowing upward, like a breeze within the rib cage, as the breath leaves the body. Repeat five to 10 cycles of this exercise. As with all the exercises, I recommend you take several normal breaths between cycles.

The lowlights on The English Riviera are thankfully rare. Trouble’s tart vocals head wistfully into a swaying doo-wop beat, with typically smart lyrics such as the cute tautology of "There’s a tear in your eye / And there’s no ‘I’ in tear".

It’s called for boycott of China due to killings of dogs and cats etc.; Japan for killing of whales and dolphins. So using/killing of dogs, cats, whales and dolphins isn’t ok, but it’s ok to use/kill other nonhuman animals. You aren’t being consistent if you think that all animal are equal but you call for boycott of those countries for those reasons. How can non-vegans be against use of cats, dogs etc. but have nothing against use of other nonhuman animals? That’s breathtaking inconsistency.

Aberrants, Dokirin warriors and shaman, and Humanoids, as well as the Blue Tree, were all pulled along into the Void, and Delver took the craft up to the Aelbaan starship in orbit in the High Aether. Being Aether-based tech, the Void craft was undetected by passive sensors, and allowed the Black Pearl and all of her occupants to become noncorporeal and slide through both Force Field and Hull. As undead, the crew and fighters acted to take control of the main bridge, and in three Turns (30 minutes) had secured that second-most important position on the ship. However, before the last Aelbaan collapsed from Vampiric fields, he was able to launch the craft on a predetermined emergency course.
once they were finished with me in triage, i was taken to the or. i met with the anesthesiologist and she was really nice, as was the nurse assisting her (thankfully, not the same as the other nurses in triage). having the spinal administered was really uncomfortable. i didn't like it at all... but that said, once it was done (and it was done inside of 5 minutes), all was good. they brought mr wannabe into the room and he came up to me, rubbed and kissed my forehead and held my hand and that made everything better... i love my mr. wannabe! before i knew it, they had started and within minutes, adam was born. for as long as i live, i will never forget this moment in my life. having dr. love deliver him, hearing those three words "its a boy!" and hearing adam belting out his first cries... honestly the best moment of my life. i cried like i've never cried before. both mr. wannabe and i stared at each other in amazement that we had a son. i was SURE we were having a girl! so much so that he remained nameless for the day. mr. wannabe was taking pictures over at the other table where they were checking adam out and showing them to me. it was unbelievable seeing the pictures and i just couldn't wait to see him in the flesh. the paediatric nurses handed adam to mr. wannabe for the first time and that's when i saw the tears in daddy's eyes too. what a moment...what a day! adam was wide eyed and blinking lots because of the bright lights. he weaseled one of his hands out of the swaddle immediately and started sucking on it ... i don't know why, but i thought this was the cutest thing i'd ever seen! after the 3 of us spent some quality time together, mr. wannabe took our little man out to meet our parents who were waiting outside the operating room and then brought him back to me so the three of us could hang out until dr. love was finished putting momma back together. once he was done, we were in recover for a few hours and then put into our own room where we remained for the next 4 days.

Born on September 20, 1989, Harry Skelton is the son of legendary showjumper Nick, who almost became a jump jockey with David Nicholson before going on to represent his country in six Olympics. Not surprisingly, Harry grew up surrounded by horses and he learnt to ride on the same pony as his father, Oxo, and took part in some of the top pony showjumping competitions as a youngster. Skelton enjoyed a summer with Reg Hollinshead when aged 13 prior to a spell at Richard Hannon’s yard after leaving school. He joined Paul Nicholls’ yard, where his older brother Dan is assistant trainer, in October, 2005, but continued to show an interest on the Flat and took part in the Bollinger series for amateur riders in the summer of 2006. After partnering a handful of Nicholls’ runners as an amateur, Skelton took the decision to turn professional on New Year’s Day, 2007, and he partnered his first winner under Rules when scoring on Temper Lad in a conditional jockeys’ selling handicap hurdle at Exeter on October 10, 2007. His first full season as a conditional yielded 14 winners but it was a quick-fire big race double in December, 2008, that saw Skelton rise to prominence in his own right. Just days after guiding Niche Market to success in the valuable BGC Silver Cup Handicap Chase at Ascot, Skelton partnered Nozic to victory in the Grade Three Rowland Meyrick Handicap Chase at Wetherby. A superb campaign reached further heights in April, 2009, as Skelton once again linked up with Niche Market to triumph in the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse. Skelton’s best season came in 2009/10 with 31 winners – his biggest victory of that campaign came on the Nicholls-trained Beshabar, who romped to an eight-length success in the Grade Three Heroes Handicap Hurdle at Sandown. He also had his first John Smith’s Grand National ride aboard Niche Market in 2010 and returned to finish fifth on the same horse in 2011.

Foucault focused on the way certain areas of “knowledge gained authority and believability within dominant social formations” and sought to expose the regulation and control of the human body by the medical fraternity (Cregan, 2006: 46). Through his study of the treatment of the mentally ill in the eighteenth century, he noted that the power structures involved in their care, sought mainly to remove those exhibiting abnormal social behaviour from society (Cregan, 2006: 46).This removal of undesirable’s from society subjected them to social control in the form of medical treatment.
“Next stop Marsh ‘Arbor, Habaco.” The ferry captain’s solid Bahamian voice echoed through the launch. It took Annabelle right back to her teens. With their Miami traffic, what a miracle the Islands still sounded Colonial.

Elon’s greatest run of success came during the 1970s and early 1980s under head coaches Shirley “Red” Wilson and Jerry Tolley. Wilson had been a veteran North Carolina high school coach before taking the Elon job. He would coach there for ten seasons, winning five league titles and making the NAIA playoffs in three of those years. Wilson then left to become head coach at Duke and was replaced by Tolley, who had been his top assistant at Elon.
The set is pared down to a collection of abstract shapes: Venetian blinds in the background for Monsalvat, a suspended disc for the Grail hall which doubles up as the backdrop for Klingsor’s castle in Act II, and rows of painted Buddha figures for Kundry to unwrap in Act III. A register of the Grail knights is printed on the raked stage apron, but apart from Kundry briefly trying to scrub off the name of

In every traumatic event, there sure are people who will bear various traumas in their lifetime. Each person has a certain threshold over something. With overwhelming destruction to properties or loss of loved ones brought by natural/man-made calamities or armed conflicts, some can transcend the situation while others cannot. It basically depends on how strong the person who faces it and supplementary to that is the quality of support system he/she has. Resilience is true to all, but we exhibit it in different extents. We bounce back from a traumatic event at our own choice, at our own pace.
“After that,” Pitcher continued, “we’ll have to see.”
Rangikura is a primary school with children from a wide range of backgrounds, which according to their website is -
This session will cover some of the background of spirits made from apples, peaches, pears and other fruits, and the ways these spirits were historically made and consumed. The session will also explore today’s realm of American-distilled fruit spirits, from the rich character of aged apple and peach brandies to ethereal eau de vie, with an emphasis on the ways these spirits are produced and a look at some of today’s most distinctive distillers of fruit spirits. Panelists will also discuss the use of fruit spirits in cocktails, from classic drinks made with aged apple and peach brandies to special considerations that should be taken when mixing with eau de vie.Location, date, time, etc. to come in early March. All I know for now is that I'll be back in New Orleans' French Quarter this July 25th-29th.
Not okay.

Meanwhile, a separate analysis confirms what most of us already suspected: The proportion of cutbacks was higher in newsrooms than it was for the industry as a whole – twice as high by the calculations I will share in a moment.
We were all given free tickets so Mum and I took the boys for a look on Saturday afternoon. A heap of people camping out there but not entirely what I expected. Seemed like a bunch of backpackers trying too hard to be hippies and just smoking and drinking and missing the whole point of the beauty of the area. But they seemed to be having a fun time so it was all good. We just had a bit of a look around and then sat and listened to the music and watched the boys dance and chase around the place for an hour and then came home. Apparently some of the kids from the local Woolaning community danced at sundown and that would have been nice to see but we did not head back for it. The music did not stop all night! But they had a groovy didgeridoo or synthesized didgeridoo track playing from sunrise for about an hour and that was nice to wake up to. It reminded me of the guy and his band that play the Mindil Markets with a great combo of hip hop sort of music and the didgeridoo and clapping sticks etc. It may even have been him??
It's been a week since I've been back from CHA. I really don't know where the time goes sometimes. I really MEANT to blog sooner! (How many times have you heard that from me lately? lol)
Elizabeth, I can't even begin to imagine how many hours were spent stitching all of these together. We will treasure them forever! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I don't know what I did in some other life to deserve these people, but I am glad that I did whatever it was that I must have done. I can't thank you enough, my friends, for all of your support and help. I hope you never find yourself in this kind of situation, but if you ever do...know that I will be there for you without hesitation! There truly are angels among us!

I didn't. I took it for granted until the clouds took it away.
