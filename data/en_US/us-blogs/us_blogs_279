The Jewish leaders were not interested to believe in a just Jew as their Messiah. They rather wanted to live under occupation and suppression of the emperor of Rome. Whom they served.
While I loved unicorns, I can only think of one story I've read that even included unicorns. It's interesting because there are some things I love that I never read enough of and yet others talk about them all the time. Another example is elves. I hear people talk about how they are tired of certain types of elves in fantasy and I love fantasy but haven't read very many novels with elves and personally I would like to read more.
But do not panic! Judging by those interviewed on the Imagine programme and the poll on the right of this blog, there's still a healthy market for paper books. The unicorn sees books becoming works of art in their own right, sold in the equivalent of antique shops for big prices to collectors, or auctioned off to Russian oligarchs to display on their coffee tables between the caviar and the samovar. Authors who are selected by publishers to provide the content for these beautiful books will still make a living, selling less books at higher prices maybe. For those authors, the book itself will be an important part of their product, even more so than today. So Bigwig Author need not be scared. And Bigwig Publisher of these new works of art need not be scared. Nor should Bigwig Agent, who will bring author and publisher together in the old way.

"Unlike other critics of comics," Mr. Wigransky writes, "I possess a first-hand knowledge of them, and unlike even those critics who argue in their favor, I can say that I was once an average, normal comic-book fan and reader, during the war and before it. Therefore i feel that I am more qualified than people like John Mason Brown and Dr. Wertham in criticizing them".

And while they were sparked by the images before me, many of my sketches pulled from themes I've visited time and again. Like the vase, which reminded me of the sketches I'd made for some beaded vessels with voids back in 2008 while at Penland. Which were originally inspired by a burl wood, turned bowl I saw in an exhibit at the airport while traveling. I look at these sketches, and I can clearly see the burl wood in the textures, though I'd plan to reinterpret it with beads.

Speaking of which, I've pretty but nixed the karate kid idea. In fact calling it the karate kid has put the final nail in the coffin for that project; I'd been carefully avoiding calling it that. Not because it's a bad idea and, given my knowledge of karate and, well, of being a teenage girl, I think I could make a good job of it. The problem is it would be far too easy to turn it into an autobiography. I'd start it with every good intention in the world then think "ooh, maybe I put in the story about that class where...." and I'm sure you can see where this is going. So bye bye karate kid, hello Death's Journal. No one could accuse me of only having one idea anyway! You can read a first draft of the introduction here, which starts to show what I'm thinking it'll be like.
Antifa, though impressive in its ability to occasionally motivate and organize reasonably large numbers of dysfunctional and unproductive youth, does not seem to be in possession of any of the characteristics that might award it some determinative influence on the trajectory any particular European state will take with respect to Islamization. Whether or not any given demonstration will take place is ultimately determined by the government of the country in question, though in hiding behind Antifa may to allow that government to shrug and attempt to avoid responsibility for making said demonstration impossible.

Anyway, it was a little unorganized as I had to guard two pews for Hibernians marching in the procession, trying my best to stop a whole slew of octogenarians who were trying to sit there, most of them with canes, one of them even blind. I didn't exactly feel comfortable asserting my authority over these people, and nobody was really going to listen to me anyway. But even though the Hibernians and Knights of Columbus bickered for a little while over who needed to sit where, and that two seats in the second pew needed to be saved for Justice Scalia and his wife (who I don't think showed up), eventually everything got settled just in time for the ushers to start spreading the word to each other that the Archbishop was coming through the door at any minute.

You are more likely to hear the characteristic call of a Chiffchaff before you see one.

The only time they stop moving is to go in to their characteristic two note song.

I liked the conversational style of writing, but some of the comparisons and slang may be outdated in a few years. There is so much information packed into this book, I may have enjoyed it more if I had just read small bits at a time. Each woman's story is only a few pages long, and complete in itself, so maybe I should have spread out reading them to be able to enjoy each story more.

The plague struck only the Aztecs. The Spaniards, who had developed an immunity to smallpox during repeated childhood exposures, were spared. The implication in the eyes of everyone who lived through the Aztec epidemic, McNeill argues, was the superior power of the Spaniards' God over the Aztecs' deities. "The whole history of the New World hinged on that episode," McNeill says. Suddenly he realized "there was a whole history that had to be written.
In 1972, the School Sisters of Notre Dame (SSND), Baltimore Province, over the objections of fellow sisters, released Gramick from her teaching assignment at the College of Notre Dame so that she might pursue a career in “gay” politics starting with the formation of Dignity/Washington, D.C., and Dignity/Baltimore. She later joined the (Marxist) Quixote Center which served as the staging base for the establishment of New Ways Ministry in 1978, and its many front organizations including the Catholic Coalition for Gay Civil Rights, the Center for Homophobia Education, Catholic Parents Network, Sisters in Gay Ministry Associated (SIGMA) and the Conference of Catholic Lesbians (CCL), the last two organizations directed at the recruitment and political networking of lesbian religious in Catholic active orders.

Anyway, I’ve digressed. The reason I began writing this post was because as we listened to music to decide what song we wanted as part of the ceremony and what song we wanted as our first dance (David had originally wanted “Blue’s Man,” by Alan Jackson but changed his mind, we were dancing to the music in our living room. It was romantic and sweet, and reminded us both of how excited we are about the wedding, but mostly about our marriage. We’re both starting to get really excited about things. As we narrow down some of the finer details of the wedding it’s becoming more REAL.
Senesh (1921-1944) was a Jewish parachutist who was captured by the Nazis and their collaborators in Hungary in 1944. After subjecting her to months of torture, through which they tried and failed to get information out of her about her mission, they executed her by firing squad.

Class War in Ireland had a short-lived existence in the early 1990s but this document gives a real insight into the organisation. Running parallel to the UK based Class War it was an interesting group which although strongly inflected by anarchism saw itself as ‘a working class revolutionary organisation’. On its demise members became involved in a range of other groups on the Irish left including community groups and the Frontline Collective.

Part of the beauty of a blog is that you can talk about whatever you want. Whatever you feel. On this blog I've talked about all kinds of nonsense just for the sake of talking about it. If I felt the need to make a blog related gesture on behalf of the millions of people who don't know I exist, I'd be more likely to go the cathartic route, and write something reflective about the tragedy.

The road to Winfield is a dusty, bumpy little bugger of a dirt road. It takes every bit of 40 minutes to drive the 12 miles, from where it leaves the pavement. And the last two-and-one-half miles has runners on it, headed either toward Winfield, or back toward the Hope Pass trail. Poor bastards…it’s dustier than a desert sandstorm on that heavily-driven stretch of road. While driving in, we saw Andy running the road back toward the Pass. He was being paced by Derek! That was good, because he hadn’t counted on having a pacer that early. At that point, we heard that he was somewhere around seventh place in the race. Now that was exciting!

They are constantly updating their displays and the treasures are all new every month!

The Eater websites, including Eater LA, Eater NY, Eater SF, etc., have long been the bottom feeders of the food blogging world. They traffic in gossip, rumor-mongering and celebrity watching like a food-world National Enquirer.

And they do all of this without any apparent interest in actual cuisine.

It is interesting to note that the court did not find that the defendant had lied, at one point the judge stated that Aisha was 18 but later acknowledged that she had in fact attained that age at the time of Mohamed's death. Indeed the fact that Mohamed married Aisha while she was a child is largely undisputed and accepted as fact by most Islamic scholars. Marriage between an older man and a pre-pubescent girl was not unusual in Islamic culture during the prophet's life and remains so today in some Islamic countries.

Listen up everyone, this year's Mumford equivalent have made themselves known. Okay, okay that might not be an entirely correct statement, but it makes sense, on a par with the many other inter-band references that have naturally sprung up to begin 2012. Dry The River haven't been under this 'hype' bracket for nothing. 'Hype' being the forever clichéd word that never seems to panic the band, only the fearing gaggle of fans that intend to call the band their 'own' for as long as they can. The London five-piece have been around for a while, perfecting this debut seeming to top their list of priorities, obviously all paying off when they were nominated for BBC's Sound of 2012 and finishing this very awaited offering.

We live in a country where payday loan shops charge their victims fifteen percent interest for a two-week loan. On an annual basis that comes out to 390 percent without figuring in the compounding, and most of their loans do get compounded week after week as the working poor fall deeper into the pit of usury. These heartless bastards can work right out in the open because they paid off our politicians to make sure there’s no law to stop them. They even put up billboards and neon signs to bring in more suckers. Does it really matter whether such companies are American or not? They couldn’t do more harm if they were owned by Al Qaeda.

I enjoyed reading the poetry and stories of Shel Silverstein because they always seemed a little bit different. I distinctly remember finding and hugging my mother at the end of Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls because I could not stop crying. When I finally did, I went back to the first page and started the book again -- I just had too. Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson and The Cay by Theodore Taylor are books that I remember, again, because of the emotion that I felt with them. I always liked Dr. Seuss, Berenstain Bear books, and the Little Critter stories by Mercer Mayer too. I could go on and on.

Still not okay and feeling it was one of those failed pieces...I began ripping parts so as to save for future collage. Somewhere in this process, I liked the shapes and stopped to stitch the vessel back together again with a few pieces lost (brown paper backing). I rather like it now and realize it speaks to the memories I've been holding/letting go. In a true sense it was like unearthing sacred parts of my life...go figure?

Long hours, incredibly heavy volume, frustrations, stress… all of those things that go along with a true kitchen experience.

In a time when the line of horizon is made out of the multiplicity of visual signs that compose a choir of autonomous voices interrelated randomly, the quest of a dynamic dialogue with the everyday imagery intends to disrupt the passive position of the observer, and to invite to the possibility of renewal of subjective experience by reflexive expansion of self-knowledge through resacralization of signs.

I agree with the author that the gay issue should never have been made THE dividing issue in morality and religion. He says there are much more important worries: Disease, hunger, racial intolerance. Agreed. And I say– ”Hmmm, intolerance. . .” Why is it an issue at all? I suspect it’s a good, polarizing issue that clearly defines who is in power and who is not. The issue is heated, and that means money get involved.

The first week of not weighing was difficult for me because I knew I had done exceptionally well with food and exercise. I wanted to see my accomplishment in numbers, but I had made a commitment to stick to my plan, there was something exciting about not knowing how much weight I had lost so far. I could tell my clothes were starting to fit looser, pants that didn’t button were fitting again. All of this kept me motivated and on the second week I added some cardio into the plan.
Gradually, our culture will find mother-son relationships more acceptable. The younger generation will see that this changes. In 2011, many of the Academy award nominated films featured difficult mothers (The Fighter, Black Swan, and The King's Speech). In the acceptance speeches, however, many of the winners thanked and paid tribute to their moms. Tom Hooper, who won best director for "The King's Speech," thanked his mother for giving him the idea for the movie. "The moral of the story is," he said, "Listen to your mother."

At this point we proceeded to tell the ticket agent to reconsider and change his answer. Ha ha.

And I cried within ten minutes of taking my seat. I think I have some post traumatic stress related to the flight.

Eh, not bad. I expected something much more off the wall. The 8% ABV is imperceptible, and there isn't a hint of the standard Belgian yeast flavors. It feels a little fizzy as well, but in general it's pretty good. Not hoppy or bready, just kind of light in feel despite the color and alcohol.
The CM of supposedly Chinese Penang has only 1 thing to do. End Apartheid. Not host dinners, fly around to Australia and prevent would be politicians from entering DAP or local politics because they’ve got a nepotism and shameless term limitless family bloc Xian fundo b.s. thing going on there. Detestable little men tend to not use nepotism granted CM’s mandates to end APARTHEID, but do ask for 750K funerals from their sworn enemies who put their fathers into Kamunting instead are unprincipled and shamelessly thick skinned! They had half a mind to kill these 2 nepotistic term limitless DAP 4th world style ‘family-business style politicians’, and now they are in the Dewan asking for 750K funeral funds which the taxpayer paid? How 2-faced can a politician get? How can anyone who thinks this way be trusted? And then look at the massive failures to keep campaign promises that helped them win. All forgotten? Go flying around on taxpayers fund now while disregarding Bumi-Apartheid?

Ok, so everything I said last week still stands, but I also had an epiphany watching her do The Climb this week that, if I can telepathically communicate it with Hollie, could be a total game-changer for the pint-sized BriTexan. See, The Climb was awesome. Those of us who remember her from last season knew it would be, right? But it was even better than I hoped, for the first time everything came together for her – it was a complete performance – and as I watched her up there I couldn’t help wondering why. What is it about that song that turns Hollie Cavanagh from an impressive vocal spectacle into a compelling artist? That’s when it hit me: Hollie Cavanagh is a country artist. Here’s this girl that they’ve been branding as a Mariah/Celine-like pop diva when in fact she’s this little country diva. I probably should’ve put it together when before this both of my favorite performances of hers were Carrie songs, but for some reason this was the one that let me see it. Behold:

“God knows our hearts, and we glorify him by having attitudes of heart in which he delights….And if others work for us, we need to think of them as equal in value as human beings made in the image of God, and our heart’s desire should be that the job bring them good and not harm.”

Whiskey writes about why conservative women don't get it, which I would generalize to why conservative women and men don't get it. The article under discussion is one by Kay Hymowitz, Where Have All the Good Men Gone?, which uses feminine shaming language and logic to indict today's young men for refusing to "man up", put away childish things, and get married. She of course ignores the nearly complete inversion of sexual values over the past 40 years or so, the existence of no-fault divorce laws - together with the fact that women initiate upwards of 75% of all divorces - man-rape in the divorce courts, the decline of the middle-class wage, and that so many of the women who want men to man up have, in the colorful words of the manosphere, ridden the cock carousel for a decade or more and are thus wholly unsuitable to be the wives of men who have a shred of self-respect as well as to raise decent children.

The methods used by Tamil Nadu police are not unique to the Southern State. From Bhopal to Jagatsinghpur to Kalinganagar and Lanjigarh, and behind the scandalous jailings of two persons for circulating Mamata’s cartoon or behind her jailing of several people protesting the eviction of the Nondanga slum near Kolkata, the thinking and the modus operandi of the State is the same – to criminalise dissent.

A rivet carefully defined as either a) a fragile egg that didn’t hatched, or b) egg shells left by a gap. Females lay their nits in the hair roots much near the head (less than 1 mm) where the incubation is less complicated thanks to the heat and humidity. If your child has lice, why look for other natural cure for her condition? Only tea tree oil can help him stop the infection for good.

I know that some analysts are worried particularly of Saudi Arabia being taken over by Al Qaeda or a Sunni version of the Iranian Islamic Revolution. Calm down. Besides my gut feeling (which is rarely wrong), the overwhelming majority of people speaking out and calling out for a revolution are people who want democracy and civil rights and not more of our current Arab tradition based adaptation of Sharia. My theory of why that is, is that Al Qaeda has already exhausted its human resources here. The available muttawas, are career muttawas (fatwa sheikhs) and minor muttawas (PVPV) of convenience both paid by the government and do not want the current win-win deal between them and the government to sour. So it’s unlikely that they would actively seek change. Actually quite the opposite, they will resist and delay as much as they can. Fortunately the winds of change can’t be deterred by a PVPV cruiser.
In 1926 Effie Knight decided to purchase a new Ford Coupe from Gaskins Motor Company in Nashville, GA. The car sold for $696.00, including finance charges. She put $208.00 down with the balance due over 12 months on an installment plan through the Standard Motors Finance Co., Inc, of New Orleans, LA. Effie gave her employer, W.H.E Terry, as a reference on the loan application. Effie paid off the loan on time and received a “favorable” letter of appreciation from the finance company.
Boy am I glad I stopped drinking coffee before we started the cleanse. Holy HORRID headache! Yesterday my head hurt so bad by 3rd hour that I thought I was going to be sick. I came home from work and got right into bed. Yuck. Some ibuprofin helped, and I know that's a no-no on the cleanse. So I'm pretty happy that I got through what I hope is the worst of the caffeine withdrawal before my body is longing for the other junk that it's used to! Kids, DON'T GET ADDICTED TO CAFFEINE!

He relate to sinners like a friend, though He Himself was without sin.

Top Ten Most Influential Christians isn’t a personal commentary about who should be on the top 10 list, but rather looks at the result of a recent Christian based survey. This book examines the results of the survey, gives a historical examination on who those people were, and some of what they said and did too. It’s not that people don’t know who they are, but rather they don’t know enough about them. Because of this, Ken Lambert and others give/source historical information regarding various figures within Christian history who made an impact; though not all of them necessarily in a positive light.

Our visit with my brother, Rog, was a bit bittersweet. He was visiting as he's moving...from Japan...to Germany. At least Germany is closer than where he's been living for the past 6 years, but I still wish he was going to be closer! The girls soaked up as much Uncle Rog time as the possibly could...he picked them up early from preschool during the week while he was here and they got to stay home with him for one whole day. They were in heaven and can't stop asking about him and when he's coming back. We don't know when we'll get to see him again, but thanks to Skype, the girls can at least "see" him from time to time!

I find that I have a hard time boasting in my infirmities, but I’m learning to accept that there just are things in my life that I’m not going to be able to overcome without being totally surrendered to God’s will. In truth, what God needs from us (myself included) is for all of us to get out of His way so that He can do the work in our lives He needs to do…and until we do get out of His way…the thorns that are in our flesh are going to continue poking us.

While my new book INTRUSION-A Keeno Action Novel, is a fictional read, and full of action, it nonetheless does raise a flag on this very issue. I recommend it for entertainment purposes alone, but if one is interested in a “what if” scenario – the ultimate in terrorism, I suggest buckling down with a few cups of coffee and reading the book in one or two goes. It is a story about a Canadian crime fighter by the name of Keeno McCole, who heads the RCMP or Royal Canadian Mounted Police Anti Terrorism unit, and who takes on a terrorist attack of massive proportion against Canada. In the process of tracking down the perpetrators, McCole and his team trip across the plot to beat all plots – plans to micro-chip all Canadians. And by the way, this is the first book in the Keeno McCole crime-fighter series – so you’ll be seeing more of him.

I am proud to call her San Antonio's first Poet Laureate," Mayor Julián Castro responded to the determination by the Poet Laureate selection committee. The announcement follows the Mayor’s State of the City address where he called for San Antonians to “be bold and invest in the city’s future” through education, early childhood education in particular.

With three other foodies, I munched my way through seven delightful courses that showcased Mattias’s talents. We also had an opportunity to chat with Mattias as he plied us with these treats, and to learn about what makes him tick and the philosophy behind Radisson’s Filini concept.

Well, they took 12 months instead of 12 weeks to finish The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron, and that’s how long they took to finish Walking in This World, too. For the past year, the 4 Chicks have walked and talked their way through this second book together. To celebrate this completion, and in the spirit of Cameron’s many excellent creative exercises in her books, I inspired the 4 Chicks to hold a “Letting Go” fire ceremony, burning their fears, frustrations and other negative feelings that might otherwise block their future creative paths, as well as a whimsical “Dream Planting” activity, articulating their top three creative dreams for the future and giving them fertile ground in which to grow.

The speaker of the Danish Islamic Association thus held a wonderfully neutral speech that everybody could digest without becoming constipated – or almost. As for me I found it rather in-digestible that he embraced “THE ARAB SPRING” and all the wonderful popular uprisings in Arabistan. Did he mean that one in Bahrain ? Or did he talk about the tens of thousands of Libyans who were liberated to death by NATO´s Operation Unified Protector and Al-Qaeda mercenaries under NATO, MI6, and CIA supervision and command ? The racist genocide on the Tawergha and tens of thousands of Black African Libyans and Black African migrant workers in Libya ? Did he mean the small protests in Saudi Arabia or did he talk about the massive unconventional and illegal war that is being waged on Syria by NATO and Gulf Cooperation Council member states, that so far has resulted in thousands of dead and maimed Syrians ? Or maybe he meant the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt who obviously believes that Islamic Banking and inviting the IMF to Egypt is compatible ? And what diversity are we talking about in Denmark, which has one of the most restrictive immigration laws among European countries – where a spouse has to deposit what amounts to 20.000 USD for seven years to get permission to live together with the husband or wife ?

The third day was my favorite. Again waking up to views of snow capped mountains, waterfalls and the beautiful cloud forest below was a winner. This morning we had coffee in our tent. After breakfast we started heading up again. Our first stop for the day was the Runkuraqay ruins, which is a tambo, a resting spot for the messengers. They actually had tambos every seven km so the messengers could quickly relay messages either orally or using a quipu, a type of abacus using colored strings with nots which only royalty could understand. After finding out a little more about the Incas we carried on up to the first pass where we did a ceremony. This was a traditional ceremony that the Incas would do to make wishes and leave all of their bad demons behind. We had to find three perfectly shaped coca leaves and fan them out. We also took little pebbles from the river. Circling around a sacred rock, Percy made a speech and then one by one we all blew on our leaves, made wishes, layed them on the rock and covered them with our pebbles from the river. After the ceremony we carried on down the mountain to the sound of Percy playing his flute. It was such a special moment.

For men are not, like women, bullied and nagged by the great houses of Parisian couture. They have no tradition and no accepted standards to guide them. At the most, the tailor’s sheets may let fall a hint or two from time to time; under the sketch of a man in canvas trousers, rope sandals, striped jacket reaching to knee and straw boater draped with constrasting scarf, for example, we may find these words of restrained advice: ‘a sailing holiday along the Breton coast calls for the appropriate outfit.’ A friendly suggestion, no more: should the holiday-maker prefer to set sail in pleated shorts and jumper with a border-pattern of shrimps or lighthouses, no eyebrows will be raised. And it is precisely this freedom which gives to the male costumes their freshness and excitement: while none can foresee how they will finally appear, few, once they catch sight of them, would allow a single item to be changed.

I believe you travel through life on a carpet ride named, “Attitude.” What’s your ride, and, is it sweet or sour? I think life is one great big banquet table, where you sample this and you sample that. You spend a little time at this station, then at that station, then you move along. As you move along, time moves along with you as your constant companion. Then, soon enough, before you know it, you come to the end of the feast. What happened so fast? Everyone thinks the same thought near to the finish line. Did I squander my time, or did I put it to good use? Only you can be the judge.

Friday was the last day for a coworker so the office threw a breakfast potluck for her. I made hard boiled eggs for the occasion but rather than leave them plain I dug out the food coloring and vinegar and dyed the eggs. The leftover dye looked too fun to throw out so I experimented with some microwave dyeing on a skein of Pendleton wool I had lying around. Not all the colors took but those that did gave it a dusky rosy purplish cast with sections of blue and green. I can see this as the beginning of a very slippery slope if I want to go that direction.

In “Audacity,” the senator wrote that such believers insist “not only that Christianity is America’s dominant faith, but that a particular, fundamentalist brand of that faith should drive public policy, overriding any alternative source of understanding, whether the writings of liberal theologians, the findings of the National Academy of Sciences, or the words of Thomas Jefferson.”
In 1912, after she called him “the Old Maid of novelists” in a scathing review of his new book, Marriage, journalist and author Rebecca West met and fell in love with H. G. Wells. The often-explosive affair that resulted lasted for some months, until, in March of 1913, Wells — 26 years her senior and already a married man — broke of their relationship. West was distraught, and responded with the following intense letter.
“Amnesty International believes his support for the opposition candidate prior to the 26 January, 2010 Presidential election may have made him a target. There are reports that others have been abducted by paramilitary groups and state agents as far back as 2006,” AI said in a statement.
I've been too busy trying to get caught up with yearly albums to think about it much.
Whenever my kids have had to do school assignments looking at our family culture and tradition, we are sort of left out in the cold. We're American. We don't really have any deep ethnic or cultural roots. From what I can tell that's common in the South, whereas in New England some people were more tied in to their Italian or German or Scandinavian roots (I'd love to know if this is your perspective as well).
Riz Ortolani’s score, which is pretty tender at times, has a short moment that fan’s of the Cannibal Holocaust soundtrack will recognize. Not that it’s a complete tune or anything like that, but there’s a small build which Ortolani later used on Cannibal Holocaust and if you know that soundtrack you will find it. Following the violent beating of Florinda Bolkan one can hear the song Quei giorni insieme a te, performed by the domestically renown Ornella Vanoni. It’s a delicate piece written by Ortolani and Jaja Fiastri which definitely set’s a sentimental mood for Bolkan’s dying moment… but just wait for a moment, things are about to get kinda strange here. I’m more curious about the funky shit-kicker Crazy, here performed by Wess and the Airedales, the same funky ass shakers that played on stage in Umberto Lenzi’s Orgasmo 1969 and Paranoia 1970. The same version of Crazy (originally written by Armando Trovalioli), which is heard on the soundtrack to Dino Risi’s Vero Nudo 1969… Now take a guess who wrote the screenplay to Vero Nudo? Jaja Fiastri, the same who wrote Quei giorni insieme a te with Riz Ortolani. Just another reason why I love Italian genre, it’s all interwoven and connected to and fro for all eternity through captivating intertext.
I am no financial guru. Like many in my generation, I have lived for today, and never trusted anyone over 30. (I still can’t accept that that group now includes me.) Saving for tomorrow was boring, old school, and the future would take care of itself.
spring green - wool belted - Princess Coat, the inside is all lined with a beige pink, rayon crepe. I have been wanting one of these forever! Then we went to Goodwill where I got this really pretty double strand pink Aurora Borealis necklace. Then we had some lunch over at Clay's Smoke House BBQ where I had the catfish. The bonus for today: We had sunshine all day! Also sorry for the wild pics of my super stuffed apartment. I had my pics all nicely cropped on Picasa but for some reason they would not come over to my blogged cropped no matter what I did.
While I was pregnant, Scotty & I made Wednesday night, our night. A night to cook together and spend time together. The only rule was that everything we made had to be fresh. Fresh pasta sauce, homemade noodles, fresh ravioli, samosas, ice cream, curry sauce, and chutney, to name a few. We had some incredible meals, and some disasters. We’ve had a nice 7 month break, but it’s time to start it up again. First up, is something simple, basic and fresh to get us back in the groove. A classic Caesar salad with some avocado tomato bruschetta on the side. Yum Yum.
This is no veiled sexual innuendo. I love hotdogs. I love wieners. I love frankfurters. I could stuff them in my mouth all day long, if it wasn’t for the calories and nitrates. Yum!
The smaller man then beat her again and ordered them to shut up - and then took her clothes off and pulled off his pants, saying he wanted to rape her. He also said he would “murder her husband when he came home”. The bigger man however stopped the smaller man from raping her. Her husband then also phoned her on her cellphone - and the gunmen demanded to know what he wanted to know from her. She explained that he 'was probably close to getting home.' The men then grabbed her cellphone and ran outside with it - waiting to ambush and shoot dead her husband, she said.

So what does all this mean for Good Burp? I don't know exactly, but I do hope it is positive. I will continue to attend beerfests and report my findings. And I will still attempt to try as many new and different beers as possible and write about my adventures with beer.
So boom. There we go with that. Maybe I am an idiot for being friends with someone like this.

“Icon is a company that loves to see others striving to be different and the TTXGP is just that,” said Kurt Walter, Icon’s brand manager. “We felt that Brammo Racing had the whole package, with a great company, staff and rider, which made for an easy decision to sponsor their efforts.”
Most of the translations come from these two volumes of Heine's writings, edited by one of my former teachers, Jost Hermand, and one of his former graduate students: Robert Holub, currently Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst:
Having traveled fairly regularly in Europe and Latin America, I decided I wanted to try something new. I was aware of the budget allocations for successful grant proposals, so I started evaluating my 'top 10' in terms of scheduling and pricing. I narrowed my regional preferences to Africa and the Middle East fairly quickly, as I have limited personal experience in those areas, and believe they will be most beneficial to my students. After careful consideration, I selected a trip to Iran for this summer's adventure. I went to work, researching the country, looking at lesson planning ideas, and crafting the grant proposal. By the time I submitted the proposal, my excitement had reached fever pitch, and then the wait began . . . .

The second round had games running. One was a multi-player Hordes of the Things hosted by Sam. I fought on the side of Tarzan and his mostly animal minions, losing horribly to an alliance of Conan and Jason and the Argonauts.
I hate the way that a refrigerator looks when the front of it is covered by magnets that companies give you for free as advertisement!! A refrigerator is not a city bus stop bench! I want my magnets to match my decor in the kitchen or at least be impossibly cute! My kitchen is off white and gray with green accents (rental house... we aren't allowed to paint so I threw in some green for color!) but I would still use these in there because they are so darn cute. They will make your fridge look all happy!

Friday - We went out for dinner at Shoeless Joe's. We shared a plate of calamari as an appetizer & for dinner I had Montreal Smoked Meat Poutine & Andrew had a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. Both were delicious & we had leftovers to eat for lunch the next day.
The best way my students have illustrated this fluency in the first semester is by using the AP-PARTS acronym to analyze primary sources and documents. This strategy is one of many offered by College Board for preparation of advanced placement students. I use this strategy because it best fits the grade level of my students, encourages them to use their writing and application skills on a higher level, and best applied to my subject area.
The girls from the Bistro Volnay have been murmuring tasty tidbits about their new restaurant for months now, and finally the gorgeous new place, just steps away from the maison mere has opened its doors. Les Jalles, as it's called, is an elegant and beautifully designed room with vintage lights and furniture sourced from England, plenty of dark wood and ceramic and looks more like a gentleman's club than a dining establishment. In fact, it doesn't look much like anything else in town. Open from 7h30 am for breakfast (pastries, home made jams, etc), and for lunch and dinner, it also has a speakeasy type bar upstairs festooned with Tamara de Lempicka style paintings of flapper era girls and headed by "the most incredible barman" says Magali. Look for this to be the hottest and most talked about opening for coming months.
“In the face of the sense - widespread among men - of menacing feminization, rites of proving or demonstrating one’s virility are multiplying. With the assistance of a context dominated by wars, the tension between what is threatened with extinction and what both formerly has been and now is suppressed is exacerbated, and relations of substitutability between the phallus and the gun are instituted.
The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) took place in Tunisia (!) November 2005. Prior to that (2003) a conference in Geneva had tried to make the UN a major player in the DNS system, but failed, mainly due to opposition from the US and EU — who both doubted, and rightfully so — that the UN bureaucracy was up to the task. The new conference was sponsored by the EU, who eyed an opportunity to weaken the US-based ICANN and grab control over the European part of the Internet.
When Ted Thompson and Mike McCarthy looked at their team they saw that a major upgrade was needed on the defensive side of the ball. The loss of defensive end Cullen Jenkins in free agency coupled with Mike Neal, Jenkins replacement, being injured most of the year and playing ineffective, really nullified Clay Matthews III pass rush ability. Teams would focus on stopping Matthews III since no one opposite of him, either defensive end or linebacker, was a threat to put pressure on the quarterback. The loss of Jenkins also effected the run defense since Neal, Jarius Wynn, Howard Green and CJ Wilson didn’t do a good enough job to take on blockers which limited Inside Linebackers Desmond Bishop and AJ Hawk.

Sometimes I let my mind drift. Actually, it’s my chief talent. I’m a fiction writer so my mind drifts continually in scenarios that will only find existence on a printed page. I do believe writers who are able to write their fiction with verve and imagination while compiling the journalistic style of blogging with flair and professionalism, are the truly talented among us.

Sanjeev and I travelled on a bike to Kollam as per the guidelines from my friend Sreekumar. Following the information, the celebration would commence in a temple named kottankulangara Devi temple that was on the left side of the highway. We could see woman dressed with beautiful dress and jewellery on bike and inside the car. It resembles a good celebration I said and even women are going to see this with new attire. Sreekumar joined us at the temple and was the narrator of the show ahead. He resides near Kollam and is well verse with the places and celebrations.

Faster-than-light travel remains impossible near Earth, deep in the galaxy's Slow Zone--but physical laws relax in the surrounding Beyond. Outside that again is the Transcend, full of unguessable, godlike "Powers." When human meddling wakes an old Power, the Blight, this spreads like a wildfire mind virus that turns whole civilizations into its unthinking tools. And the half-mythical Countermeasure, if it exists, is lost with two human children on primitive Tines World.

sunburn, and a waxy buildup on her skin, the Sphynx has become a popular pet (among cat lovers of certain tastes) and a staple of popular culture. Austin Powers’ nemesis, Dr. Evil, commits mayhem with his beloved Sphynx Mr. Bigglesworth at his side. A series of children’s books called Bad Kitty (by Nick Bruel) features a Sphynx cat called Strange Kitty. And in an episode of FRIENDS (The One With The Ball), Rachel brings home a show quality Sphynx named Mrs. Whiskerson, whom Joey insists is not a cat at all, Gunther suspects to be some kind of snake, and Ross claims must be inside out. Though not an ideal pet choice for everyone, the Sphynx has truly earned her swag.
So, as I said before, I almost died. Here is what actually happened.
So I figured the worst of it was over.
The paper is from K&Company, buttons are from MFT, ribbon is unknown, and the flower is a Prima. Copics were used to color the kitty, and her collar was made with Platinum Stickles. Did you notice the little paw prints on the PP? I thought that they were cute. :)
Sam forced her trembling legs to move, ducking to avoid the low overhang on the door, and entered a small room mostly filled by a large wooden table. A fire crackled merrily inside a stove, scenting the air with cedar. A pot bubbled and a wide assortment of dried herbs and flowers hung from the ceiling. Despite her nerves, Sam felt somewhat comforted. It was like a rustic cabin in the woods, not nearly as unfamiliar and scary as she had expected. As long as, of course, it didn't fall out of the tree. Abby and their father crowded in behind her and she shifted to give them room. Abby's hot breath hit the back of her neck.
I went online to research water-efficient top-loaders. Consumer Reports gave several of them high ratings (as it had the front-loaders two years ago). But the consumer comments presented a very different picture. Average satisfaction was two stars out of five, and quite a few people were pretty heated in their criticisms.

They arrived at a gorgeous mansion with an awesome koi pond. They will be posing as art installations at a dinner party where the other girls will be guests along with grammy winner, Estelle. The Brits especially are overjoyed to meet her because she is from England and successfully made the move to America and became popular here. Annaliese did really well in the shoot, as did Sophie and Eboni. Everyone else struggled. Kyle had to wear butt pads, which really pissed off some of the other girls because it gave her somewhat of a booty tooch advantage. Alisha promised drama at panel if she gets eliminated over Kyle.
Can honestly say I wasn’t expecting that.

Bronwyn continued: “The welcome video on EdFringe.com says: The Fringe was created 65 years ago when eight companies who hadn’t been invited to take part in the international festival, in the true show-business tradition and in a flash-mob style decided to stage their work anyway. On a tradition of open-access and freedom, to have censorship issues from the Edinburgh Fringe Office themselves seems to go against this ethos they claim to abide by.”

It wasn't long ago that the only person most of us knew with autism was Dustin Hoffman's character in Rainman. Now, almost everyone has a friend or family member with a child with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The current statistics say that approximately 1 in 110 children in the U.S. are affected by some type of ASD. This can range from Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) to severe autism. This number is up 13% from the mid-90's. We're not sure what has caused the increase. From my reading, it seems to be a combination of things.

I bet you come to the same conclusion if you approach the matter rationally and logically. I’d be happy to talk to you more about my views on these pieces of legislation further! Just let me know!
We profess to be a Christian nation (the Founders must be rolling in their graves) yet we seem to abhor the body "made in his image and likeness" (see, I remember my catechism) and deny the amazing feelings it can produce. It's enough to make one's head explode!

That got me to thinking about the novel, Lucifer’s Hammer, I had also referred to in the post, and the fact that the comet in the novel was never actually called that. Within the story, most people simply called it “The Hammer,” while the scientific community called it “Hamner/Brown” (after the guys who discovered it). But it was called “The Hammer Of God” as well, by a small-but-very-loud religious minority. Ironically, that “small religious minority” damned near finished off the human race after “HammerFall” – but for the inspiration of a single heroic figure, crying “We used to control the lightning!” as his plea against that final nightfall.
City officials claim they ran up $235,000 in legal expenses in the injunction. The City was represented by the Toronto law firm of Gowling Lafleur Henderson which fielded a team of seven lawyers in the day and a half of court hearings in early September.

Zaven Paul Panikian: Born in Cairo, Egypt, to Armenian parents on February 9, 1948, Zaven Paul Panikian migrated to Australia in 1963 and settled in Sydney. Paul worked in government and legal positions, followed by small businesses. He joined the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC in 1969 and served in Sydney Lodge from 1970. In 1996, he was a part of the formation of the English Grand Lodge of Australia, Asia, and New Zealand, and served on the board as vice president. He was elected to the position of Grand Master by the Board of the Supreme Grand Lodge on October 7, 2008. Paul continues to work from Sydney where the Grand Lodge is located. He lives with his wife and four boys not far from the Grand Lodge and Sydney Lodge. His research interests lie with what impact mysticism has had directly and indirectly on humanity, and on the Rosicrucian quest today, considering what impact it has on the arts, culture, education, etc.
Of course not. Conor has something much more horrible to fear, something much more difficult to fight. There’s a focus that comes with tragedy, a loss of anxiety that isn’t so much courage as it is the realization that, when all is said and done, some monsters are really very minor.

I received an email from an ex boyfriend the other day saying that he’d just watched The Artist. He’s one of those guys who feels no remorse when it comes to watching pirated films; I think secretly he is a bit of a pirate because he drinks rum too. I’ve adjusted my position on piracy since the advent of those annoying adverts. Piracy does not fund organised crime or terrorists; FACT. And FYI I would steal a handbag, a car and candy from a baby.
Many years ago when we were stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City, South Dakota, we were invited to a casual dinner at the house of some friends. We were served a simple but delicious taco salad unlike any I’d ever had before. It didn’t have meat, but I found that with this salad, I didn’t miss it. It was by far the tastiest taco salad I’d ever had. I nabbed the recipe and made it many times over the years, tweaking and fiddling with the ingredients until I ended up with a version I liked even better. I served this taco salad for lunch when the Sparky Bloggers were here last week. They insisted they must have the recipe, so I figured I might as well share it with the whole Sparky Nation. This recipe is simple enough that even non-cooks can pull it off and look impressive, and it is great for hot weather when you’re pretty sure you’ll die if you have to turn on a burner or heat up the oven.

Another futuristic and fatalistic novel? Think again. This is not just a hypothetical situation. Saramago intended to reflect the situation of our current society. We don’t think of ourselves as blind and yet we only see what we want to see. We only fight for ourselves without thinking of the consequences this will have on other people. Our societies are just as fierce and selfish as some of the characters in the book. We don’t realize that staying together and helping each other out is what will save us.

HOW IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?! Who does these things to their children? Part of a parent's job is to protect their kids, and dressing them in clothes that call negative attention to them, sexualize them, and disrepect them and those of us around them who have an ounce of class and decency, does the exact opposite. Why do things like this even happen? Apparently the idiot wind is blowing really strong in my part of the world.

I’m also looking forward to seeing my Zumba students make progress toward their goals and having fun during that one hour of their day. And last, I’m looking forward to traveling a little this year and making a trip back to Mississippi to teach and host world-famous belly dancer, Ms. Tamalyn Dallal.
The 24 hours of the pooram was a real phenomenal and eye-opening experience for me. I can truly say that this magnificent force of nature will leave people enthralled, thrilled and scintillated for a reasonable part of their lives and that may be the reason why they come, every year, to bear witness.

Don’t get me wrong, some parts of our lives are exactly the same. We both have friends that we love to hang out with. We both have to contribute around the house. I clean it up, and Kizzy makes it messy again (and smelly, if you know what I mean ). And we both have to work.
We headed up to Olathe, to celebrate my dad's birthday, but he had meetings. So, really I was able to give him his birthday present and talk a little before he left. Chris so kindly watched over Ben and Kira while mom and I took the younger girls shopping with us. We went to the Book Sale at the Library, Michael's, Ulta, Party City, Chic-fil-a, and Children's Orchard. Instead of making the girls all matching skirts to match Cecilia's blessing dress, I bought the girls jean skirts and white shirts, and cecilia has a white dress that I'm going to change up some. So, now I'm going to wait for my lace to come in and I'm going to use that and some ribbon to dress up the outfits and make matching hair bows. That will do, I hope! I'm trying to make life easier, instead of incredibly hard. I don't really know how to sew THAT well! Speaking of Cecilia though, I have her going home outfit now! Leah picked the sweater, so I grabbed the matching jeans and we already had two shirts at home that would match, so the hard part is choosing which shirt for her to come home in. I've got her clothes in drawers, diapers and wipes stored, and her bed next to mine. Now I just wait a couple of months to meet her!

If we look at it analytically, if we look at it historically, we quickly find out exactly what it is. Political Correctness is cultural Marxism. It is Marxism translated from economic into cultural terms. It is an effort that goes back not to the 1960s and the hippies and the peace movement, but back to World War I. If we compare the basic tenets of Political Correctness with classical Marxism the parallels are very obvious.

Transworld, who offers the Terry Pratchett Prize, is a huge publisher with lots of resources. A £20,000 advance is easy for them. It is still very generous. But there is a word of warning. If you win and your book is a flop, it may be difficult to become published again. It is a massive advertising campaign for both Pratchett and Transworld.

Murray does discuss graphic representation and how the way the numbers on the side and bottom scales affect how the results appear and are therefore interpreted. He is careful to label his scales to be comprehensible but in the old fashioned linear way. Perhaps he isn’t at fault for this because I spent a couple of hours looking for visual scales which would present percentage data in a way that made better visual sense. Perhaps they don’t exist, so I was compelled to create one and perhaps a whole new way for the visualization of data.In the old style percentage chart seen above from page 160, Murray presents a standard and well done linear percentage-style graphic view of the information but it misrepresents the data. We have all seen thousands of charts like this, but they are all flawed. The reason is that in some sense the data is logarithmic and when going from low percentages like 1% to mid-range percentages like 50%, the data goes through a fundamental change of character. I made the chart below, which would correct that distortion. It consists of two logarithmic charts running in opposite directions and meeting at 50% midpoint with their end points set at 1% and 99% respectively. The extremes are not at 0% and 100% because logarithmic graphs run to infinity. The chart seen above could be extended indefinitely by adding more logarithmic cycles at each end. When a single cycle is added to each end it would make the chart run from 0.1% to 99.9%. [Click here 0.1% to 99.9%. for a more recent and better drawn chart.]

Zinc acts as an antioxidant and this is one primary reason why it is so helpful against acne. Antioxidants help to clear the body of toxins and free radicals. These can cause various problems in different areas of the body, and in the skin these can lead to pimples and acne breakouts. Keeping the skin, the largest organ in the body, clear is only too important. Zinc helps to keep the skin clear and healthy and prevent the build-up of these toxins and free radicals, therefore being proactive and helping to prevent acne breakouts altogether.

This 1987 Caldecott Award winner has a wonderful vintage feel. A sat through all 30 pages without any problem thanks to the large illustrations and short sentence structure. The language is very simple, as if a young child were narrating. Page by page, it describes all the wonderful benefits that come with having a tree. "Even if you have just one tree, it is nice too. A tree is nice because it has leaves. The leaves whisper in the breeze all summer long." The illustrations alternate between full-color paintings and black and white ink sketches. Their simplicity is the perfect match to the narration.
So if a company’s margin is 15% for instance, that means its net income is 15 cents for every $1 dollar of sales it makes.

They are not in the same class this year but me and Little G's mom have been able to get the too together for a few play dates!!!! Lemmer(aka Brian my husband you know the one I shacked up with) we really like this boy. Little G is fun to be around and has manners and best of all he has a little brother Gracies age so she doesn't drive him insane!!!!

Romney, of course, is no Bush, not even as hard as the Obama Campaign will try and portray him as such, he doesn’t pull of a cowboy hat with any panache, and is more comfortable in a business suit, which is fine – one can issue a stern threat in a business suit, still be seen by the European’s as despicable, and well, keep the crazy’s at bay, even if they only offer a small threat to a school of flounder in the Pacific, does it matter?

I’m sure some of our friends and family don’t agree with us about not trying to enforce a Because I Said So policy with HB. (Though not my mother; she raised me the same way.)

Through their grip on power, the Slave Masters have amassed wealth and enriched themselves at the expense of the poor. And in order to perpetuate their rule and enslavement of the people they turn one tribe and one religion against the other as is seen in Kenya, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, DR Congo, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Algeria, Egypt, Togo, Liberia and Congo. They install their children as successors instead of allowing democracy to work. Faure Gnassingbe of Togo was installed as his father's successor and so did Joseph Kabila of DR. Congo who replaced Laurent Kabila, his father as president. There are clear signs that Gamal Mubarak and Major Muhoozi Kainerugaba will respectively replace their fathers as presidents of Egypt and Uganda.

I like to be positive. I believe in the power of looking at the bright side of things. I like to use this space to write out my thoughts and feelings and in some way it helps me to write them out in a positive manner, because if I do that, then I find it easier to believe them. But today, I need to take a step back from that and acknowledge that I’m having a hard time accepting everything that has been happening. That I am not feeling very positive or hopeful. That I need to take the hurt and the anger out and leave some space to sow new dreams. It hurts.

It was a surprise... My daughter and I made all the arrangements before she arrived in St Rémy... fortunately she had a few days before her birthday to acclimate. She woke up that morning to a very excited pair suggesting she hurry up, get ready because we were going to Paris to do our celebrating... It does sound crazy to travel two and a half hours on a train for a lunch but when you are Australian and in the habit of long haul travel... a couple of hours is a mere bagatelle... besides where better to start a new decade than in Paris...There are many glorious ways to spend a day in Paris... many restaurants, many arrondissements... and so much to do and see... Some days are all about history, some days are full of culture and some are more about discovery but this day was all about pleasure... we were celebrating not sightseeing... we were playing grown ups and ladies who lunch... Champagne, delicious food and... perfume were on our agenda...

Not everything in F1 is aggressive, extreme, radical or innovative. In fact in many areas the car’s are very close in general design terms.

Sarah runs the photography studio at Viables that opened earlier this year. After I wrote a blog post about the new studio I contacted Sarah to ask if I could attend a session with my husband and little one. We had a lovely time and the photo’s came out so well. There are some awesome pictures of my little one, I just wish I was more photogenic! Typically my little one wasn’t playing ball that day so after 30 mins we had to stop the session. However, Sarah made us feel so welcome and the shots that came out were very natural and exactly what I was looking for. The session was also very reasonably priced and I get to keep all of the shots taken from the session. Sarah even gave me a letter of permission that allows me to use them for printing, etc.
3) Don’t give them reason to worry. If your dog is a alone-at-home barker, one way to diminish barking is by conveying to them the idea that it’s no big deal to be home alone, and that the home is a place of rest. You can help your dog understand this by not working them up when you come and go. Don’t say “ok, honey, Mommy’s going to leave now, but you just stay home and be a good boy!” Nonchalantly pick up your keys and go without a word to your pup. When you come home, practice no touch, no talk, no eye contact to help your dog understand that it’s no big deal when you come home either (I realize that this takes a lot of self discipline, but it IS worth it to your pet!). Feel free to love and cuddle your dog like crazy when they are being calm. Your goal as pack leader and authority figure is to promote calmness in your canine (this is what pack leaders do in the wild).

As in all stores in China, haggling is expected and encouraged, and be ready to low-ball them with your initial offer (I would say, 25% of the asking price). Of course you’ll get their requisite aghast look, but don’t worry…. this is all a ploy, and part of the ritual.
I don’t know Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and I don’t know enough about Liberian politics to predict with confidence where all this is heading. What I can say is that promoting democracy by picking heroes is a risky game. If our governments want to support democratic consolidation in places like Liberia, they would do better to eschew the search for “soulmates.” Far more important than these shiny personalities are the humdrum agencies tasked with protecting civil rights, channeling citizen participation, and constraining authority no matter who’s in power. If you’re going to champion someone, don’t make it the charming leader who spouts the buzzwords diplomats and bankers want to hear. Instead, make it the honest cop, judge, or civil servant who sounds like her neighbors.

I found this interesting tidbit in an article documenting Scholten photographing Wild Bill Hickok about September 1865 according to an article written by George Ward Nichols for Harper's New Monthly Magazine. "Hickok and another former army scout Dave Tutt had just been in a classic western shootout on the public square leaving Tutt shot through the heart" as is retold by Donna A. Beardsley, "Two Resource Materials for Teaching about the Old West." Nichols arrived on the scene on Army business and documented the story which other newspaper sensationalized adding to Wild Bill's notoriety.

While the other detainees were released, however, Chong was “forgotten” by DEA officials and left in his cell without food or water.
The Man Who Wasn’t There
In an NBC Politics article published yesterday entitled ‘Analysis: Kevin Bacon Theory of Politics overtakes 2012 campaign’, contributor Micheal O’Brien discusses CNN Deomocratic strategist Hillary Rosen’s recent comments about Ann Romney’s career choice and singer Ted Nugent’s recent comments about Barack Obama and the upcoming election. More specifically, he talks about how each party is trying to tie these comments somehow to the presidential candidate of each respective side, even though, there appears to be no connection beyond basic party affiliation. Mr. O’Brien does not compare the two beyond his assertion that fallout of surrogate comments happens to both sides, but the drawing of an equivalency is sort of inescapable, and in this way, I feel that this article, by nature, speaks to a broader argument.
Everything has to stop sometime, doesn’t it? People live, then they die, and they are, in a way, forgotten, aren’t they? Someday, the Universe will end, and everything will return to what it was before the universe was created. Yet, if the Universe has no edge, yet it’s always expanding, what is past the Universe?
The result is a beautiful “set” where there were just mismatched pieces before.

The thing is...the friends I do have? Amazing. Some of my favorites are at work with me--and I get to spend a mandatory 40-hours a week with them. So that's fun-- unless I become good friends with someone of the opposite sex and then there is gossip everywhere and people start judging--to the point where I feel I need to cut ties. Or maybe a friend whose reputation isn't stellar and I get lumped into the negative with her just because she's one of my favorite people.
Because it's a belief, that's why.
Cut one potato in half lengthwise. This will be the body. Cut the other potato in half horizontally. This will be the belly. Brush the large potato stamp with black paint, and stamp as many penguins as you like. While the paint is drying a little, brush glue underneath the penguins and sprinkle with salt for snow. Brush smaller stamp with white paint, and stamp bellies (black paint does not need to be completely dry). To finish, cut beaks and feet from orange construction paper and glue on. Add googly eyes, and voila! You've got yourself a whole herd of happy penguins!

Tex has been trying to do everything but his science experiments earlier in the week, leaving them for Fridays. This works for him because I can be more involved on Fridays, and he can pound out the other book/computer work faster if he isn't stopping to do experiments throughout the week.

Her cover identity is as a waitress in the Pork Pit which is owned by Fletcher. Gin also loves cooking and reading, although we don’t see her doing much reading this time. She insists that all emotions are a weakness but she’s very loyal to Fletcher, Finn, and all her other friends. She’s also lusting after Detective Donovan whose partner she killed earlier.
As we don't have snow, sleighs or anything else that's in the original Jingle Bells song, Colin wrote some alternative lyrics for Aussies. It's sung a lot in schools at end of year concerts.

Fellow beer blogger Mudge has a theme to his blog, and arguably articulates his views in more adult and less puerile manner than myself, and that theme is clearly the smoking ban. I don’t wish to alter the theme of this blog nor intrude on another’s but I occasionally find myself in agreement, occasionally in disagreement, with dear old Mudge.
So I was a little bit excited a while back when out op shopping I came across a "Boobah" iron on motif. I kept it hidden from him and have waited trying to think up the best possible way to utilise it.
Penang, as with Victoria, lacked natural resources. Both had to build on their human talent to be competitive to better internationalise in engaging globally. There were prospects to strengthen the value chain in the respective economies by building on global supply chain, without either having to relocate industry.

It feels like rejection. And- I ought to be able to deal with this, I ought to get the job- I find my lack of control distressing. I need to accept that I am not in control. So the spiritual growth stuff which I do has value.

After a calm and civilized cup of tea (“you’ll be a while yet,” reassured the mid-wife on the phone who was later proven wrong) we picked up my bag and left. As we drove away, I could see the silhouette of my Mum and Dad who were visiting us from Australia, kneeling on their bed like kids, looking out the window.
In different ways, each speaks to the suspicion and unease that the idea of "anarchy" stirs. Anarchism might be interesting and, compared to other currents of radical and socialist thought, an attractive "libertarian" alternative, but anarchism is still linked with violence, utopianism and rebellion in equal measure. Do either graffiti artists or their audiences realise that the circle scrawled around the A is actually an O and that the symbol stands for "anarchy is order"?

Penang and the port city of George Town is a four-hour car ride just to the north of Kuala Lumpur. Penang makes claim to a number of UNESCO heritage sites, rated by NY Times as the number 22 on the “Must see list” in the world, and boast the best Asian cuisine in the country if not the world.

What about irrational phobic fears? For many years, mine was spiders. I’m over it for the most part, although truthfully, I still don’t like them. I can either ignore them or at least remove them from my personal space and go on with my day.
First off, I want to thank you for the love you gave my awesome guest posters while we were gone. I hope you liked that series, because I think we'll need to bring it back! I'm also still blushing at your kinds words on my Getting Older, Can I Do This Gracefully? post. It was a toughie to write (vanity much?), and I certainly wasn't fishing for compliments, but you made this almost-40-year-old *choke* feel great. Check out the post if you haven't already, it also has a pretty sweet $100 giveaway of fancy-pants skin products!
Ah yes, the arrival of Fashion Week means that it's hard to refuse giving your own next season wardrobe a little bit of thought. For me Spring 2011 will be all about carefree dressing. But I mean real carefree dressing, as it's an important priority in spring and summer (and one that is very fresh in our minds with the warmest season just drawing to a close). Carefree dressing in that slightly Charlotte Gainsbourg way that says 'comfort and necessity will triumph.' I've noticed that with the current trends comes a lot of praise for austerity and minimalism, and I'm as head over heels with the Celine look as the next person but it strikes me that this doesn't always equate to honest comfort. In the Spring time button up shirts can't always be relied on when the temperatures rise. And a light skirt is less likely to be at the forefront of your mind all day than a strict pair of high waisted trousers.

Sounds kind of trite, but I was at the grocery store last weekend and had already decided I was going to make my first batch of chili since last winter.

I remember wondering how this would work, how we could sit next to each other in the front seat of a car for 20 minutes every morning and afternoon and retain the same veneer of restrained civility we exhibit in the office. I wondered if we would talk, or listen to the radio, or simply sit in silence as we commuted down the highway.

Not a one. Work with me here: for a movie like this to be successful, you have to have at least one person in it that you recognize; someone whose face you know was a good actor or actress that has been in other successful films. That kind of a reassurance would go along way in something like this. But... Taylor Kitsch? Lynn Collins? Sure, Willem DaFoe and Thomas Haden Church are here, but in voice only. I wished we could have at least seen their faces instead of just two very entertaining and expressive actors embodied by rubbery CGI aliens. Is it just me, or does a story like this at least deserve someone to look at onscreen that's a familiar face? Star Wars had Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, how could it have hurt John Carter?

He know loves sitting in his exersaucer and playing. He is constantly moving some part of his body. He is like a little worm, even while swaddled he can roll over. He rolls, scoots, kicks, and punches constantly.

I watched 'How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days' and thought I'd tinker in a little 'How To' list myself. Can I just say MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY IS SO HOT! The first points 1-4 would not be applicable to him, of course. They are only relevant to The Husband when I am trying to avoid Special Love. Which is quite often. And will certainly be tonight. The Husband is out at an Awards Ceremony which he insists is very hard work with all the networking that has to be done when in fact it's just a jolly with free wine. Bastard. He will miss the last train then come in smelling of booze expecting a jolly with his wife. NOT GONNA HAPPEN. Anyway, he's left bedtime all to me and that's how I came up with the idea. I have just been in the horror movie which is putting 3 kids to bed. Nightmare On My Street. Or The Bed Time Project. Or some other crap title that I am trying to make funny.
The Crucible is not Prothean, remember. It is a Reaper design and, like the mass relays, it is a test. The mass relay signals that its time for a reaping. The Crucible signals that its time to stop. There is enough time during the Reaping to construct it. Everyone else who has attempted to do so has failed, even the Protheans as Javik explains.

Obtaining a statistical overview of Muslim crime in the UK is very difficult, due to the extremely low quality of the data available, and the problems involved in their interpretation. Every three years the government releases a breakdown of criminal convictions by race. These summaries offer a significant amount of information to the student of crime, but not, sadly, information that is useful in a consideration of Muslim crime. As such, we must look to other sources.

I am seven years old. My mum, my brother and I have just watched a cowboy and Indian film. It suddenly occurs to me that the Indians are the same colour as me and my mum is not the same colour as me. I say to my mum, Mummy why aren’t you the same colour as me? My mum says, Because you are adopted. I say, What does adopted mean? My brother scoffs; Don’t you know what adoption means. He’s eating a giant-size bowl of cornflakes. He eats cornflakes for nearly every meal.

Gather up your materials. So far, I'm under $30 for all my supplies. Not counting the chair, it just showed up in my shed one day, looking for a makeover - and it's getting one! It looks like the last owner had painted it a brown color, and rubbed some more brown stain all over it. But the chair was sturdy, good bones - and that's what you are looking for. We don't want to go crashing through it after we put this much time into it! Take a peek:

If you were judging Nier purely mechanically, it’s easy to see why it attained the mediocre review scores it did. There are a very limited number of environments to explore which you spend a lot of time backtracking through. The environments are pleasant enough, but not that interesting. The enemies are repetitive. Combat can be a bit clunky. Most of the magic spells are fairly useless. The AI partners you pick up over the course of the game are completely useless. Most of the game’s quests involve either killing things or fetching things. Choices you make don’t matter. And the “real-time” mechanic for growing crops is just ridiculous.

Working in one of the small SVDP clothing stores we own I was witness to a sweet miracle. One afternoon a young mother and her five year old son came into the clothing store I was working alone at. She was a very sweet girl with this cheery voice I can still hear if I stop to listen to it in my mind. Her little boy was bouncing around the store and so excited to see each item we had hung up. Mom was on a mission to find her son some warm winter boots. I helped her find just the perfect pair and offered her to take them to the counter so she could keep looking hands free. At one point the little boy showed his mom a beautiful dress but one you would wear to say a prom. It had lots of pretty bead work on it. She lit up and said oh that is so beautiful and I think I will save up for it and buy it for myself. She held it to herself and twirled around in the mirror. The little boy had to keep touching it and asked his mom why she would not buy it now. She explained she needed to save up for it. Now mind you the dress was priced at $5.00. It had a few flaws on it that had me price it so low. She found the flaws as beauty marks.

I’m like that with thrillers. There’s some deeply unpleasant aristocrat enfolded in a lithium prison somewhere in my brain that makes me want to sneer at all genre literature, and an equally disgusting Guardian-reader in the next cell muttering about the responsibility and potential consequences of any fiction that has an MI6 or CIA agent as its protagonist. But fuck it, I don’t care. I love Kingsley Amis, reactionary pulp writer that he could at times be. I adore Graham Greene, especially when he most resembled an adolescently agnostic Catholic. I grew up reading Ian Fleming, racist and rape-fantasist, and if anyone ever asked me to write a Bond script my cremaster gland would probably explode. Len Deighton, Joe R. Lansdale, James Ellroy, John le Carré… they’ll all do nicely, thanks.

Turns out, the end didn’t want me. I awoke the next morning, jittery and disoriented, and spent the next two days vomiting incessantly. Rather than becoming determined to try again and this time succeed, I concluded that although death would mean an end to the pain, somebody like me did not deserve to escape it. I was born to hurt.

I was really in not writing mode when a reader emailed me about his breakup and my blog. He said, and I quote, “I liken your blog to Adele’s album (if you know it, 21 it is called) … Shit hurts, but then it will get better. My friends tell me this, but I don’t listen, yet when I hear (read) a complete stranger blog about it, I know it will be alright.”
So yeah, I had plenty of photos ready to edit well before midday. I had started them, but then it was time to head out to pick the children up. Then we went for a walk and when I planned to sit down again to try to sort through them, we noticed the time was nearly the time to get going for the darkroom. Which also nearly ended up as a wasted journey as we didn’t realised the reception was closed at 7pm, so there was nobody there to let us in. We tracked someone down though, so we ended up getting something done. However, my first film had nothing on it, which annoyed the hell out of me. Luckily, I’d had 2 films to develop and the second was fine. But still, it’s horrendously annoying.

The song, recently given a spooky reading by Cage the Elphant, sadly still speaks to 21st century American racial relations as evidenced by the tragic death of Trayvon Martin in Florida in February of this year. While the evidence in this explosive case has not all been assembled, the fact that George Zimmerman* could walk away free after killing the unarmed youth he pursued against the advice of law enforcement is shocking. The coterie of far-right reactionaries willing to "philosophize disgrace" piles insult upon injury. There is no question that Zimmerman chased, shot and killed Martin and it is my belief that if there are any mitigating circumstances, they should be argued in front of a judge and jury, not played out in a media free-for-all.

Ya know how people always say “I wouldn’t be caught dead reading that kind of book,” or “I wouldn’t touch that kind of movie with a ten foot pole.” For my wife, it’s western movies.

One of the things that appealed to me most with this book was the combination of magic and nature. Sure there was plenty of magic and curses and invisibility caps going on, but there were also poisons made solely with herbs, antidotes and practical remedies. Reveka spent the entire book relying on her know-how and not some magical solution to her problems.
I’ll share the positive first. Dave and I were married this past Saturday, March 31.

To hear, from the comfort of your sofa, one of the most eloquent lecturers the art world has ever known, the late Kirk Varnedoe, surf over to Charlie Rose's archives. The conversations with Varnedoe are still available online, and I think my favorite is the hour-long rebroadcast of the talk about MoMA's 2003 Matisse-Picasso exhibition. During this show, Varnedoe (former chief curator at MoMA) is joined by his successor John Elderfield. I've said it before, but I was lucky enough to listen to Savannah native Varnedoe in person and he truly was an amazing speaker.
My favorite part, though? It means it's one less thing I need to carry around with me every day. Which is particularly helpful as my best friend teases me about carrying the world around in my backpack.
I know, I know, I really need to read Room. And I will - I already own it but in the meantime The Sealed Letter actually has caught my attention more. It's based on a scandalous court case of divorce in Victorian times with accusations of rape, adultery and secrets. I just know I'm going to love it.

The Guard returned his footsteps heavy with purpose to find his key on the ground. He cursed picking it up. Just then another guard called the first for the changeover. It was all so perfectly timed that Coal dared to even breathe. He had taken the risk of coming here not even knowing if there was a way out. There was no space beyond his reach; he could scale the highest walls, picking locks always staying on the tail end of the beast. Coal had a reputation to uphold and he’d heard the whispers of this door so deep in the high imperial courts that it couldn’t be reached by any quick fingers, as his brothers were known to each other. Coal looked around he was crouched in a dark corridor with no light other than the crack of the door behind him. He looked into the endless darkness and straightened, moving forward slowly he felt along the walls and floor. The imperialists often set traps for fingers like himself. His entire body dripped he shook his head, Coal like his name had black hair and deep eyes, he was tall for his age and blended into any crowd. He was not so much handsome but had a more silent and disturbing air about him that made people unconsciously avoid him. He came to the end of the corridor and felt another door in the dark, he fished out a set of hooks from a hidden pocket and began searching for the key hole. After a frustrating period of time he realised that the door didn’t have one. Stumped he searched again this time methodically running his fingers in lines across the door from top to bottom what’s more the door was made of concrete.

For those living in Hawaii, Alaska, and California, the three most seismically active states, earthquake insurance may seem to be a requirement. However, even in those states, many homeowners haven’t purchased the extra coverage that would protect them from large losses. According to the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), which provides the majority of earthquake coverage to California homeowners, only 12% have purchased earthquake coverage. In Alaska, which is one of the most seismically active areas in the entire world, this number is only a little higher at about 33%.

So those were the things I officially named as my New Year's Resolutions. I also want to lose weight (who doesn't) but I couldn't make that an official resolution because 1. that would jinx it and 2. I would be super embarrassed when I didn't lose weight. See, if you announce it out loud that you're going to lose weight, it makes it that much harder to do. You have to trick yourself into doing it, by making it a secret resolution. (Other forms of self-trickery that I enjoy include, but are not limited to 1. Wearing clothes that are too big for you so you feel thin and 2. Setting your alarm clock ahead by 15 minutes and then hitting snooze when the alarm goes off. ) I've still been working towards that secret goal of weight loss, and with very little success (related, perhaps, to the sucess of my dip resolution?).

In better news, Brad found one more calf in the field, at least two weeks old, born after the mamas and babies had been sorted into separate pastures for breeding.

My husband took some amazing photographs which were published in the local paper along with the story. In order to walk down the street, it was necessary to climb through the white van, as the road was completely blocked. We spent a long weary night working with the county surveyor, the electricity board and emergency builders to ensure that the house was safe to go back into and secure. We were a little astonished to be asked to give an assurance to the listed buildings person that we would not convert the hall into a garage now that we had seen that a car would fit into it.

In 1937, there exists a law (Act 1639) which bars native non-Christians from drinking gin or any other liquor outside of their customary alcoholic drinks. Cayat, a native of the Cordillera, was caught with an A-1-1 gin in violation of this Act. He was then charged and sentenced to pay P5.00 and to be imprisoned in case of insolvency. Cayat admitted his guilt but he challenged the constitutionality of the said Act. He averred, among others, that it violated his right to equal protection afforded by the constitution. He said this an attempt to treat them with discrimination or “mark them as inferior or less capable race and less entitled” will meet with their instant challenge. The law sought to distinguish and classify native non-Christians from Christians.

Be aware, of course, that even the best of plans might not work out. When I launched CHRONAL ENGINE, I brought along an extra extension cord for my computer as well as an extra-long VGA cable (I didn't have a wireless/remote mouse for my computer and I've found that ones for the projector are a bit iffy). I also had masking tape to secure the cords against people tripping on them. That way, I figured, I could stand at the lectern and operate my slides myself. I had also prepared a Prezi presentation using the laptop (not cloud-based) version, because I knew I wouldn't be able to get Internet access.

It takes twenty minutes for my pc to warm up, if I rush it then it goes a bit crazy - security icons flash, warning of great peril, inferring that I'm not protected and that world's going to end, or some such... so I start repeatedly clicking on things and swearing... and we all know that repeated clicking is never going to help in a computer related incident...weird windows pop up... the timer thingy whirls around and around... this morning I had to log off and start again.

First, here is an astonishing image of our dear planet (click on it to see the detail) that I ran across in the The Blue Marble: Earth post over on the Metousiosis blog:
I had to stop. Obviously some of these thoughts I did not question or take seriously. But I did question why I would speak to myself like that. I know the importance of exercise and eating right. I know I want to take care of myself. I know right from wrong. So why is it that I could hear those thoughts? Why would I talk to myself like that?
I'm in good hands I'm gonna be home soon
Of course, there isn't anything like the bond between a mother and her first born son. He loves me wholly and completely, as I do him.
Last night the PNM held their walkabout in St Augustine and scoffed at the hysteria coming from the govt. The Keith insists that the purpose of UNConfidence 2012 is merely to inform the population. Rowley faced questions about gay marriages (which he sidestepped), sustainable development (which he deflected with reference to encouraging more young people to come back to the Public Service….how you getting rid of the old ones?) and the way forward for the party. The PNM is clearly in campaign mode. Moving from community to community to drum up support, not for the UNConfidence vote. No one under any illusions about the party winning the motion…people are more concerned by what will be revealed as a result of the motion. But the PNM is obviously attempting to bolster support for a brand that is aging and seeming to fail. What plans they have in store for their next fifty years of growth and development are still very much up in the air. This party is going to need to rally more than the faithful if its going to be a force to be reckoned with come 2015. And Rowley acknowledged much of this. In between discussing the party he did manage to throw some barbs at the ruling cabal.

Usually at the mention of nightmares they shy away and pull faces, until I tell them about the nightmare I had. It was a few years ago now, but that doesn’t matter, I tell them of how I’d dreamed of a horribly monstrous grave digger – and I'll do a swift impression so they get the picture! I tell them how I woke up in a cold sweat but instead of letting the bad dream worry or frighten me, I made good use of it - I scribbled it down on a scrap of paper by my bed.
Well....the girls did.

There were a couple of vacancies that affected the industrial lease market; one was Express Scripts vacating 71,000 feet at 4500 Alexander. The Wildfire TV series lease expired in Rio Rancho at the Fulcrum building and that brought 68,313 square feet on to the market.

In the old days, monsters were always a metaphor for The Bomb; these modern ones were definitely a metaphor for something, but I couldn't quite work out what. The gringos' carpet bombing and chemical weapons seemed to be causing more damage than the creatures themselves, and a lot was made of a huge anti-alien wall which the US authorities were building all along their southern border. There was a bit of talk about how the U.S was 'imprisoning itself'. I suspect the message we were supposed to come away with was that the Third World, despite all its poverty, violence, and scary viruses, is actually no more of a threat to us than a swarm of aggressive walking squid the size of office buildings. Or something.
Despite all that we launched on time and all seems to have gone well! If you are interested in how the show went you can read my report on the FIBIS website which includes photographs and a video interview with myself.

US regulations require the federal Alcohol Tobacco Tax & Trade Bureau (TTB) to preapprove all alcohol labels used in the United States. Companies wishing to sell any form of alcohol must apply to the TTB for a Certification of Label Approval (COLA). Through this process, the TTB reviews the label for compliance with federal regulations.
Often in times of worship, we experience God’s gentleness and comfort. But Undone Worshippers experience altogether different meetings with Him… It is only in holy moments, marked by discomfort and soul-searching that we encounter the Lord Almighty in all of His greatness, majesty, and awesome splendor. It is in light of this that we realize our own weakness and can honestly say, like Isaiah, “Woe is me, for I am undone!”
In this lesson, we will look into what Jesus said about prayer as He discusses its outward forms and instructs concerning the inner reality.

I didn’t have my iPhone with me for my first sighting but I did this time. Though hard to see in the photo nearby it’s high left on the main tree trunk. I had never seen one before so twice in a few hours seemed particularly peculiar. Once Lorri Hare, the head of the Humane Society, got to the Cave I asked her about this strange occurrence and she said for some odd reason albino squirrels were common in that part of Kentucky.
To any rational person, this argument in favour of immigration to pay for pensions, services or anything else is total lunacy, which is merely storing up problems for the future.

It's like my blindness makes them blind to seeing the "real" me. They don't see that I'm smart, capable, out-going, professional, or social. All they see are these blind eyes of mine.

And there I was. A week later - yesterday, in fact - in Taunton. And first I met another Tweeter (sorry, can’t do Tweep), Nicki (@waysidehealer) at Brazz for a quick cuppa. And she was as lovely as I expected. And we swapped teabags (as you do) – my Yogi tea for her Pukka – and talked social media and healing and the universe and so on.
*To prepare plank, soak in water, juice or wine at least 2 hours for grilling, 30 minutes for oven baking. Pre-heat plank in the oven or grill until the surface is dry.

I enjoyed both of these at the Amundsen Bryggeri & Spiseri, also in central Oslo. Neither of these two draughts set me back as much as the bottle of Nøgne Ø IPA. Still, at about 100 kroner (12.50 euro) each, they would have be the end of the end of the fun, as I'd already maxed out my monthly tasting budget.
Its been three months since I was brought down by work to live in a city which over the years has stolen my heart and now being able to live here I realise just how fortunate and blessed I really am. For me personally this has helped me grow not only in my independance but as a person as for many years now I have wanted to move out into my own place and fend for myself . No more mom and dad making sure the fridge is stocked, I have to remember to get all that I need which sometimes is a mad dash to the shops:) It has shown me how to budget properly and use my money wisely, that being said I have still managed to keep my social life somewhat active. I have proved to myself that I am strong enough to be on my own and become more comfortable in my own space not relying on having to be busy so that I don’t sit alone.
The prose poems of H. P. Lovecraft, disguised within what appears to be a sinister occult tome; this design is a play on Lovecraft’s own imaginal grimoire, the Necronomicon. Arabic and English are poised side by side, expressing the themes and characters of the interwoven tales. The reader feels he/she is immersed in mystery, due to the bizarre symbols influenced by multiple ancient cultures. The occasionally unorthodox structure, and deliberate obfuscation, challenge the reader to explore the book as an aesthetic object, a machine of arcane sensation. The book is bound in black goat, and contains a large letterpressed folding plate.

I actually enjoyed the first half of Pamela. I’m utterly fascinated by characters with a strong moral code, especially when adhering to that moral code alienates them. I liked it in The Crucible and I liked it in Pamela. It read like some sort of late night exploitation flick, as Pamela keeps dodging advance after assault after advance from Mr. B and his increasingly odious lackeys. My particular favorite moment was when Pamela actually managed to escape the mansion that served as her prison, only to break her leg and receive a concussion in the attempt. After considering suicide to end it all and protect her virtue for good, Pamela is brought up before Mr. B and the foul Mrs. Jervis and tormented even more. I saw her as a little Determinator of virtue, hellbent on getting out of this bad situation and back home to her parents. And, best of all, she actually claimed her own virtue (and this was, at the time, seen as something more valuable to the upper classes!) and questioned the culture that led to Mr. B (albeit without ever saying a bad word about her mistress, the one that spoiled him). Despite the writing, which could be repetitive and sentimental, I actually cared about Pamela and wanted to see how she would get out of this bad situation and strike out on her own.
But I need to provide some background - I've been a huge fan of both Lou and Metallica at different times in my life.

As a result of its unnatural structure, your body processes the amino acids found in aspartame very differently from a steak or a piece of fish. The amino acids in aspartame literally attack your cells, even crossing the blood-brain barrier to attack your brain cells, creating a toxic cellular overstimulation called excitotoxicity. MSG is also an excitotoxin, and works synergistically with aspartame to create even more damage to your brain cells.
This week has been strangely out of time. I've had the cold that's been all over town - not as bad as some have had it, thank goodness, but bad enough that my nose is raw from tissue and I want to sleep all the time. In the interests of doing the things I mean to do every day yet somehow don't, I've been using this calendar/list website. I like it! It's clean and simple and crossing things off is satisfying. I know I could probably set this all up inside a calendar program or something, but I like it this way. It's not one more thing to figure out, it's just typing and clicking and actually watering the plants.
I’ve mentioned the bridesmaids. Aaah the bridesmaids. I personally tingle with joy when I see the bridesmaid’s dresses. You’ve got a Bride and she’s picked her closest friends to stand with her and help her during “her day”. These are obviously women she loves dearly but one should never EVER underestimate the psychopathic nature of a betty. Bettys will tag photos of friends looking minging on Facebook, bettys will talk behind each others backs, bettys will get jealous, bettys will compete. It’s taken me 28 years to find an exception to the rule and I’m still looking. If you think I’m wrong look at the classic bridesmaids dress. If the Bride has hot friends she will find the most unflattering cut in the most diabolical shade imaginable. She will pretend that it’s actually a fashionable colour but forgive me for asking when mint green, peach, lilac, lavender, baby sick yellow, greige, beige brown etc became acceptable shades for anyone without a pension? Combine the putrid shade with the regulation bridesmaid cut-to-accentuate-the-arse and even the hottest betty will look suitably awkward.

This rather bizarre ruling meant I didn’t get to Perth as the game was switched back to the Tuesday. My distraction at checking my mobile phone under the table at the swank restaurant was picked up by my acquaintance who wasn’t the slightest bit amused. Especially as the game went into extra time and Hearts waited until three minutes before the end until netting the winner. Punching the air with my fist and shouting yes several times wasn’t quite the romantic end to the evening she had anticipated…
One of the things John and I love most about traveling is meeting new people and Costa Rica is wonderful for that. We have met some amazing folks here in Playas del Coco. The Ticos that we meet in town are happy and helpful and always with a smile; Alfonso, the cashier at the Auto Mercado, who helps us find the items we need, Misael, the taxi driver who takes us home and helps with the grocery bags, Nareer the pool boy who loves to chat, Rafa who speaks very little English but always eager to help. Rafael, David and Freddie, the guys on the fishing boat who work their butts off to ensure we have a good time. These are just a few of our new friends. Even with the little Spanish that we speak we are able to communicate and get along here.
There's plenty of climbing all over London, providing you don't mind climbing indoors on synthetic rock. Personally I always preferred outdoor climbing on the grit stone edges of Derbyshire or in North Wales. But I had to start my research somewhere, so I interviewed Mark 'Zippy' Pretty, one of the top UK climbing coaches today. Here he is route-setting on the climbing wall at the Swiss Cottage Sports Centre.

Unfortunately, this business went under some time after it opened, but the location is dear to my heart. I spent many an afternoon in the Cannery as a child and teenager. In fact, the whole wharf area was a always a big draw for me. Teeming with life: pungent smells, delicious food, beaches, seagulls, boats, Alcatraz, exotic dialects, interesting people walking around from all walks of life - from all over the globe, tacky souvenirs and tourist traps..................it was more than my youth could desire. So I came here with my family as a child and escaped to this place when I could as a teenager with my BFF's. It was fitting that I make some kind of over the top display to make my mark.
Alison Weir is one of the best pop historians writing today, as far as writing accessible and entertaining books that also have their facts straight. I'd recommend any of her books, but this is the newest, and would be great for fans of The Tudors or The Other Boleyn Girl who want to get the real story of Anne Boleyn's sister.
Now we’ve arrived at a place where even Tweeting is taking too long. There was huge wave of negative publicity directed at members of Congress who spent more time thumb-wrestling their BlackBerrys than paying attention to the recent presidential address before a joint session of Congress.
I used about 200g to 300g pork. I don't know whether this portion is called tenderloin of what ??? but it's a long strip of pork with visible fats and it is used for making sweet and sour pork. If you buy your pork from butcher, tell him you are making sweet and sour pork. If from supermarket, the package will usually labelled it "for sweet and sour pork".

I’m sure that Stalin’s secret police, or the East German Stasi, kept themselves busy with people’s hate crimes or, in their case, ‘crimes against the people’ (i.e., crimes against the state). All Government setups tend to grow in size and power and thus become bureaucracies. That is, before other people on the outside come to realise that they are manufacturing their own ‘hate crimes’ or whatever the alternative happens to be.
The ranunculus bulbs arrived a few weeks ago, and I’m hoping to get them out next weekend, where they will still face nights cold enough to get them going, but hopefully not too many of those cold nights. In addition to this, we’re also hoping to get some ground tilled under to facilitate early plantings (peas, lettuce and spinach).
After being given the heave-ho, The Squires were given the opportunity to set foot in the recording studio and have careers in their own right which - presumably with few other options available - they took full advantage of. "Games People Play" had recently been a hit in America and was chosen for the band as a crossover single, but it failed to attract much attention in the UK despite several critics predicting a hit. In fairness, whilst this run-through of the track is faithful, it's a long way short of being the best version and fails to make much of an impression.
Internationalization
Back to ethics. I think that the only reason for having a flat ontology over any other is ethical. And I don’t think you can separate ontology, epistemology, aesthetics, and ethics – yes, for practical purposes they may be distinct, but each implies the other when it comes down to it.

The headline coming out of the debate may well be Gov. Perry and immigration. It’s a complex issue that he has had to wrestle with as a border state governor, with no help from the federal government and often running against the grain of the party base here and there. Dick Morris tweeted that Perry won’t survive the immigration onslaught he experienced tonight. I don’t agree with that, but I won’t deny that he’ll have some ground to make up.

We did get out, though, to see an excellent version of David Copperfield at Bolton’s Octagon theatre. They captured the whole story so well. I’m sure even people who had not read the book would have understood.

I went to my lame as HELL dentist appointment this week to have my three cavities filled. I kept gagging while the dentists were working and it made me remember that I have a very strong gag reflex. I feel really sad about that because it means that I'll never be good at sucking dicks like a real slut. When I got up from the dentist chair I had sex hair. It's a shame that I'll be going to have all of it shaved off in like two weeks.
A decade later, the authors of that study are gone in name but their spirit of unending wars is alive and well within the Obama Administration’s recently announced “Defense Strategic Guidance” as part of “Sustaining US Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense,” Where Clean Break offered what was then a radical Middle East military strategy, Obama’s DSG identifies US military priorities for the 21st century to “confront and defeat aggression anywhere in the world” with an emphasis on the Middle East and Asia-Pacific region as the “greatest challenges for the future.” (Panetta, 1-5-2012)

I've seen alot of stitchers finishes of the Sarah Elizabeth Brook sampler and I've got to say, I've kicked myself a fair number of times for not getting the chart when I had the chance at the retreat this past November.

We have had him for a week, and he is nine weeks old. he seems to have only two “settings”, so to speak. His “sleep” setting, and his “play with ALL the things” setting. I prefer the sleep one, as it contains less painful claws.
The week seemed to only take 2 days to fly by, can not believe how fast the days seem to go. Today our neighbors from across the street came back to the park, and we had a nice visit. They have both been fighting the Big C, so it was good to get to spend some time with them, now that things are looking better. They have a house in town, and do not live here any more, but hope to spend more time visiting. We went with them to dinner at a Mexician restaurant, fun time, great food. I had the special, which was shrimp wrapped in bacon, and a seafood enchilada. That was a really great dinner. Everyone was happy with theirs, but the my shrimp were out of this world.
Meanwhile in this weeks episode, more focus was away from the track than on it. Ace managed to gain a small upper hand against Michael in his not quite clear plan regarding the race track, gambling and something or other about making money. Personally I find Dustin Hoffman a little hard to take as a gangster. The guy is 5 foot 5 inches tall and looks even shorter. He ought to have been given an ashtray like scene, himself. I’m not sure about this quiet menace. Although on the other hand the scenes where he spoke to Michael were great so maybe I am sure about his quiet menace.

The same could probably be true with bin Laden’s body. It’s highly unlikely that, even if Warren were right about the location — and again, there’s very little chance he is — he would be able to find a body bag in the bottom of the deep sea.

We can pretend we don’t care about community, but in fact it is quite literally impossible not to. We can be a total curmudgeon, and refuse to even speak to our neighbors, but our withdrawal has no effect on the fact that we live surrounded by our community, and it is certain that any one of that community would call 9-1-1 if they were to see our house afire, without evaluating our curmudgeonry before doing so. So would you, you old curmudgeon.
Venturing into the uber cool neighborhood of Williamsburg in Brooklyn can be a little overwhelming for someone seen as a hipster to outsiders. If you love the hipster culture (which I most definitely don’t), Williamsburg is your kind of place. The Knitting Factory seemed to be a magnet for the hipster crowd on the final night of the festival. It was nice to see the band Guards step on stage in their very anti-hipster vibe and play a raucous set of good old fashioned rock and roll. Their music very nicely mixed raw rock and roll with some pop sensibilities. They had a tinge of the Cold War Kids to their performance. The Guards definitely took charge of a hipster-laced crowd in Brooklyn that night.

My strategy was simple, making use of a couple things I had lying around my fridge, which regular readers will probably recognize. I started by making this pizza dough recipe from Smitten Kitchen, which was easy and straightforward yet unquestionably awesome. The crust came out perfectly crisp and the crumb wonderfully soft; the only thing I’d change next time would be to roll it out a little thinner.
But we couldn't keep her.
Why does there exist a fear of pain within me? Logically speaking, it would be because I have felt pain in the past, found it to be unpleasant, and therefore do not wish to have it re-occur. Further logic would indicate that the more severe the pain, the more severe the fear.

The first part of my answer is that you study the worldview through the eyes of the real-world history of the Magical View Of The Universe. This is in contrast to the view of the Magical View Of The Universe you can see through the eyes of The Scientific View Of The Universe. It's all about Shifting Point Of View, an exercise writers do everyday, three times a day at least.

I use my pizza cutter for many things. I cut quesadillas, sandwiches, pancakes, waffles, spaghetti, you name it. I use it all the time. My latest use for my pizza cutter is to chop herbs. It quickly chops leafy herbs from a coarse chop to a fine chop. I like it better than using a knife because I just cannot seem to do it like they do on TV. They make it look so easy.
They also give a revealing insight into the role of his wife, Emma Beal, recruited as his £45,000-a-year ‘office manager’ when he became Mayor.
This lovely monument is to Sarah Morley from her devoted husband. Sarah, only twenty-nine, gave birth while at sea and died just a few days later. My husband and I were admiring this beautiful and touching, yet tragic memorial when a gentleman walked over and spoke with us for a bit, telling us that it was carved by Wedgwood. Checking the cathedral’s website, I learned that, indeed, it was done by Wedgwood designer John Flaxman.
Decrease the oven temperature to 200°F. Place the baking sheets in the oven; bake until the meringues are crisp on the outside but have a marshmallow consistency inside, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Check the consistency by poking into the bottom of one meringue pillow. If the meringues start to brown, decrease the oven temperature to 175°F. Remove from the oven and let cool completely on a wire rack.

The really big ideas in digital marketing are starting to slip away from digital shops. Could that be the real reason why digital specialists and their apologists have given up on the "big idea?"

This history is further illustrated through three interviews published in the book: With Susan Rapilye, a descendent of one of the earliest European families to settle in Brooklyn, with John Muir, founder of the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment, and with Lennard “the Chicken Man” Thomas, who operates the Union Street, Carroll Street and Third Street bridges that cross the canal.
The Simpsons Movie – I still can’t quite believe that this was finally made. It’s going to make an ungodly amount of money. All I hope is that it’s funny, and that I don’t have to see it amid an audience of screaming children. And that there's a lot of Moe.
* Are your publishers open to all your ideas or do you have to censor yourself because of your target audience? Are some issues still considered too risky or taboo?
“But my car, my cheap lager, what’s going to happen to it?” I begged.

Redemptive blog traducement are important to earning income with a micro-niche journal.

The 'negative space' in art is the room around the subject, which is sometimes called 'positive space' then. The room around the subject in food photography is often filled by props and side elements. And the props and side elements can become subjects on their own supporting the main subject - the food. In general one would not call this negative space, because it is filled with 'side' subjects, although it is possible that this background and side elements work as negative space in some way. More obvious is the negative space, when it seems to be 'empty' too.

Early 1900 English Tudor buildings dot the landscape. I have drank so much tea i have to head to the hotel. On the way I come across this beautiful guest house, built in 1934 as a boarding school for the English expatriate children.
The interpretation that the spiritual gifts are given to the visible Church, and that these gifts are not signs of individual salvation makes sense in light of what the writer goes on to say:
We are not where we should be.

Many times, I break up my cool gray sequence slightly, though you may not notice.
Today we gathered at the Asian American Cultural Center with several other Asian Organizations including VSA, TASA, RAPS and RCC to discuss and learn about the different ways that stress, nutrition, and exercise affect our bodies and our mindset! Among the issues discussed were the importance of and methods to relieve stress, the history and usage of traditional Asian medicine, the significance of diet and exercise, traditional forms of Asian exercise. We also got to much on some delicious carrots!

Pey Berland’s reputation is that of an intelligent and wise man, who enjoyed immense powers but also remained modest and took great care of those in need, right up until his death in 1458. In the following years, this chapel was built at the exact spot where he was born in Saint-Raphaël:

Before I plunge into the technicalities, let me first say that the job of the interviewer is to provide an opportunity for storytelling. And storytelling is an ancient art. It’s in our bones and in our blood. Only recently has oral history played a lesser role in the human experience, but we’re still incredibly primed for it. Have faith in your interviewee! She has a voice. Your job is to help her find it, coax it out, and convince it to join the chorus of stories needed to drown out the single one.

The following week - and I'm not making this up - they had an LGBT party at the White House. Please tell me that LGBT activists in the States expect more than a Whitehouse shindig? He then awards honours Billie Jean King and Harvey Milk. Nice, and welcome for sure but I feel underwhelmed. On and on we go. Federal law which apply to everyone are included (which seems patronising) and in the case of care costs for seniors is insulting given the massive issues that face LGBT seniors. The list largely comprises of making speeches, saying he doesn't like things, and making the occasional video. These are not achievements, they are sound-bites. Judged by actions rather than words, with the exception of repealing DADT, Obama has been a massive let down for the LGBT community. What does he offer for the next term? Nothing according to this. Quite astonishing. He also has the brass neck to state that DOMA is unconstitutional and they won't defend it in the courts. That doesn't mean it won't be found constitutional in the court, and nor does it stop the law being in force right now, affecting millions of Americans this very day.

Grimoire is the second album from Belgian composer Pepijn Caudron, who specializes in bleak, creepy soundscapes that are balanced between modern composition and dark ambient electronics. Caudron arranges clusters of minor-key string crescendos with bits of piano, discordant processed horn blurts, bassy electronic drones, sampled voices and snatches of operatic singing. The music is nerve-wracking and intense, placing one continually on edge as its strained strings seem like a prelude to murder, madness and horror. On "Wrak," the tension-building rhythmic scrape of the strings soon gives way to a chaotic, tumultuous pile-up of noisy percussion, chattering voices, and horns that seem to be screaming in anguish. Caudron's music alternates between such intentionally ugly dissonance and stretches of eerie beauty that are no less unsettling. (Thanks are due to Carson Lund for making me aware of this great album in time for it to make this list. He compared it to an aural horror film, and that's very apt indeed.) [buy]
Well the red rose is to celebrate Sant Jordi Day (or St. George). It is rumoured that in the middle ages there was a dragon eating all the animals around the small town of Montblanc (which is about 70 km from here). Once the dragon was finished with the animals he wanted to eat some people. So each day they would draw names to see who would be sacrificed so the dragon would not attack the town. One day the princess’ name was drawn. So the king of Montblanc had to sacrifice his daughter in order to save the kingdom. Well, just before the dragon was about to take off with the princess, Sant Jordi strode into town on his horse and slayed the dragon. When his sword went into the dragon’s heart, blood shot out and where it landed on the ground a red rose sprung forth. Sant Jordi plucked it and gave it to the princess, who was by this time completely smitten with him. She wanted to marry him but he turned her down, as he said he needed to continue on in his quest to rid the world of dragons. (Pardon me if I have some of the details wrong but it was told to me in Spanish). So that is why they give roses here, since 1436 apparently.
When I finished the brochure I got my very first 12pc. set of Copics (which I still have today). The president of the company is Ken O'Connell, who was my drawing professor the next term at the university. That was over 8 years ago. Over the next few years I did a couple more projects for Copic and shortly before I graduated they offfered me a full-time job as the graphic designer. Thus my employment with Copic. Slowly, over time, I moved from the graphic designer on to being the product specialist and getting to travel, meet new artists, and help others learn how to use their art supplies.
At ten o'clock at night we heard a knock on the door to our room. We opened the door to see a tray with fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and a dish of ice cream with chocolate raspberry drizzle on it. Decadent and delicious. Before we left, we bought a bottle of the drizzle. Wow, it is good.
It's not as though we don't have the time. Those long, drawn out moments take minutes. Or even seconds. But for most of us it's not something with which we had much experience in our own childhoods. How many times did you have an adult just sit with you and gaze with wonder at your face while you were awake?

The Tuanku also hit out at Hindraf leaders for claiming that “ethnic cleansing” occurred in Malaysia, saying that it was an outrageous claim, which had damaged Malaysia’s image.
The Sharks are currently tied for 9th, just two points out of the playoff picture. The Anaheim team hasn’t played well of late, and neither have the Sharks but they are overdue for a winning streak. Fans hope they can start that streak and keep it going for Monday’s game against the Ducks.
As for the best use of browned butter? In my opinion, that has to be in the financier. These Plum & Hazelnut Financiers – crisp and chewy of crust, rich and moist of crumb – owe their sublime, nutty, caramelized flavour to browned butter.

Unfortunately, Guan Eng kept talking about the benefits to Penang people within a short time during his term, for example, giving RM100 to senior citizens. This can never fulfill the needs of people nor enhance the standard of living.

Bail is one of the ways the poor are kept incarcerated and people with money get released. Some activists refuse to post bail as part of their moral or political stand. For others, the choice may depend upon the situation.
So all the kids are home from school and playing quite nicely together--much to my surprise! But I can't say I want school to be canceled again tomorrow!
It's made me realize, certain things you can't control, and its pointless wasting energy and time on them, instead put that time and energy into something you can have an influence on. Life really is too short! So with giving myself a talking to (several times), I have decided to give it a go, yes of course I'm still worried sick I will fail, but if I don't try I will never know, and so what if I do fail. Yes of course , I'll feel bad about it, but at least there is not another "what if" to add to my already very long list.

I'm a total noob at this (a key reason I was seeking an agent!) and don't want to miss the chance of my book being something really wonderful. Although I'm not afraid to embrace new technologies, I believe traditional publishing is better for many reasons. I know a good editor is worth her weight in gold and can do to a good MS what a good Art Director can do with a bunch of disparate pieces of art and copy.
