“OMG, I’m glad that hour’s over,” said Michael Johnson, 47, a vice president of an manufacturing firm based in the US. “It was such a pain in the ass refraining from doing anything destructive and selfish during that stupid hour. But now that we’re all back to normal, I’m happy to be spending energy needlessly, throwing away household waste indiscriminately and generally being a prick with the planet,” he continued, while adding that his chemical and manufacturing plants will be stepping up its factory operations in Asia and Africa despite slow demand for their products, simply to spend as much energy as possible and release as much pollutants into the air and water as they can.

“What I Do?” This is one of my favorite lines I use, and always spoken with a hard southern Bill Clinton accent, when I ask folks why they are pissed about something I said. I am the type of guy who will ask a question, in response to comments people make. I will respond to comments I here in the grocery line,at work, in a tavern, or at a family Christmas party. Nobody gets a free pass on publicly made comments.

What is expected? Usually we see damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes hit the ring / square / sawtooth / rectangle epicenters within 24-48 hours (possibly 72 depending on the amount of frequency injected into the area). Usually the strongest parts of the coming storms hit these spots directly… we should see tornadoes form and move directly to the scalar square areas . Damaging winds and hail (again with possible tornadoes) .. the strongest parts of these storms.. will hit the RING epicenters.
Milan Petrović: Slavic languages have three branches, so in ideal case at least one language from every branch (preferably the one that is spoken by most people) would be required, i.e. Russian for East Slavic branch (this is the language in which most titles on Slavic religion are written in), Polish for West Slavic branch (language spoken by one of the most numerous populations of Slavic pagans), and Serbian for South Slavic branch (language that allows one an access to every language of central South Slavic language system and also the language in which most of the papers on Slavic religion and customs in Balkans are in, closely followed by Croatian and Bulgarian).
Here's a quick pic of a bracelet I just made so I can wear it tomorrow. What do you think? It's not a great pic I know, but to explain, one string is silver chain and glass beads and the other string is just glass beads.
Third, when you are done bowling, leave the area. Don’t hang around the counter where you were bowling. There are tables and chairs you can socialize at. If you feel you have to continue hanging out at the counter, move around to the other side. It’s very irritating to have someone standing, and blocking the way, to us trying to put your bowling balls back and preventing us from storing our purse or bowling bags. We like to place them under the counter, under the racks of bowling balls. We also like to have something to drink while we are bowling. We could not do that yesterday, because the previous group was hanging around, and had the counter filled with their stuff.
Early in the morning, I was late again for third problem base learning discussion. I was worried about myself actually in this sense. I am trying to figure out and yet I knew it where the root of the problem arises, but it seems like I was not dare to face it in reality. I was trying hard to nullify or better to say was hoping to reduce this bad habit. Due to personal procrastination, this will leads into affecting my punctuality system. Dare to said, this was a totally a bad habit. Shame on you, try to put this back off. There is not a good things to practice with somehow will even cause you more harm in future for the time being.

This is a driving force behind my desires not only for my own life, but for the parenting decisions I make. This is also the fundamental force behind the Christian parenting advice and teaching I will present here. It isn't to suggest it is the only way, or that other ways of parenting or wrong...but only that I want to ultimately do what is BEST for my kids, not simply ENOUGH. And that starts with me. Sometimes that takes slow and painful change within myself. Truth is, I'm a sinful human being still being perfected. (Shocking revelation, I know!)

My current obsession and collection is of tiny, very old, little bisque dolls. I find a lot of them at the flea market or antique stores. But I don't like to pay too much for them - just a few dollars each. I always think I'll make them into jewelry pieces, but have a hard time parting with them!

Jordy doesn't really understand the game so we just let her pick a guy and move it around the board...Well let me tell you when she landed on Neleah's property and Brad said "Princess doesn't have to pay" Shit really hit the fan then!! Neleah just about lost her mind!!! Before she stormed out of the room in a rage screaming "It's not fair, Princess never has to do anything!!!" we had to whisper to her that Jordy was not really playing...That seemed to calm things down a bit and Neleah was able to breath again.
guides are good value for money, containing something like thirty two pieces of information given by Tom about the various parts of the tour plus extra exclusive information in videos, sketches, picture galleries etc. for each of these, but having decided we would finish going through the guide whilst we had our tea at the end of the tour (as I noticed several people doing before we went in) I wasn’t impressed to discover that by the time we finished the tour the battery was about to give out. We therefore had to give up with the guides about half way through. If I was going on the tour on my own I would probably

The Junkrestore Vintage Market Sale this past weekend was a big success for everyone involved and was tons of fun! There were a couple of big items that had a lot of blog buzz around them that I was really hopeful would sell, but sadly didn’t, namely the Damask Dresser and the Chevron Dresser. Both of these great pieces are still available, so contact me if you are interested in them.

It's been quiet some years ago that the the Principality of Andorra had an entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. They wanted to participate this year but their entry arrived too late at the EBU. The artist that should've gone to Dusseldorf would've been Paul Bence, an Australian born singer who was raised in Spain. Despite the fact that his song "What comes next" was turned down for the contest both the single and the album became a big hit in Spain and France, the neighbour countries.
He was back in his place for Part Three at his table by the very front of the stage.

In HypnoBirthing Classes we do various fear release exercises i.e. we tackle the fears that the parents hold so that they can move on positively to the fantastic birth that they are going to have and the parenting adventure ahead of them. Often parents talk about how they are going to cope and say, ‘I don’t even know what to take to hospital’. I have just finished working with a second-time around couple for whom the memory of carrying various items of paraphenalia around hospital is still strong. Personally I remember calling my mum in a panic towards the end of my pregnancy because I had no idea what I needed to buy for my baby and then she started to bamboozle me with words such as romper-suit and babygro. She may as well have been speaking Hungarian!
We packed up and went to school as usual on Tuesday morning. This time, however, I went in with Ashley, and Trent went back home with Samantha. He was so awesome to take off those two days. There was some teasing about the pages of instructions about when Sammy needed to be to preschool and when she would be home and what time he needed to be where to get Jon to and from school, but the truth is that he asked for all of that to be written down. In a small bit of confession time, I had a minor panic moment going into that school with Ashley. It was strange and discomfiting not to return home with Sammy. That is a totally strange reaction I know, but it only lasted a few minutes and off we went.
For the most part, Owen sleeps from about 7:30pm until 6:30 when I wake him up. Weekends he'll sleep until 7 or 7:30. Allergies, sicknesses, and teething have been disrupting this a couple of nights a week. And if he's wide awake - he will not go back to sleep without a bottle. I know he doesn't need it, he knows he doesn't need it - but he gets it because I'm tired and what else can you do at 3:00am?

They are all divided right down the middle between the hypocritical and meaningless divisions of Left and Right. And they all have small oligarchies running that show who – because they protect their positions – utterly fail to represent their constituencies at large. Republican, Democrat, Labour Party, Conservatives, UMP, Socialists, Labor, Liberals, and PASOK, New Democracy. The people they represent – all of them – are the people with the kind of money, organisation, and communicatory power to make a difference to opinion generally, and elections in particular: globalist multinationals, banks, media conglomerates, Internet Service Providers, and bureaucrats.
What’s remarkable isn’t that Barrionuevo cites these sources; for the most part, I don’t even disagree with the points they raise. Instead, it amazes me that Barrionuevo doesn’t quote anyone willing to frame Cristina’s reelection in a more favorable light. There’s certainly no shortage of local political observers who recognize that Néstor and Cristina made life better for a lot of Argentines, and that this might have had something to do with this past Sunday’s results. Even Clarín, arch-enemy of kirchnerismo, was willing to credit decreased unemployment and increases in personal consumption as major factors in Cristina’s victory; the people “voted with their wallets,” one of the paper’s commentators announced. (If you’re curious about the government’s relationship to Clarín, check out this earlier post.)

The Supreme Court has just shifted what will determine the entire future of our political landscape. We have a rare opportunity, due to the size of this change, to focus the national debate on the landscape itself. If we miss this opportunity, or get it wrong, our political discourse may be even more severely compromised than it already is, and for decades to come.

It's so foul it should be a curse word, the nasty kind that my parents would have pulled out soap and ordered me into the bathroom for. Shudder.

However, as the provider of sanctuary, and very substantial financial, military and logistical support to the insurgency, the ISI appears to have strong strategic and operational influence – reinforced by coercion. There is thus a strong case that the ISI and elements of the military are deeply involved in the insurgent campaign, and have powerful influence over the Haqqani network. This relationship appears to be of a different nature, or at least order of magnitude, than suggested by most studies. However, this assessment has been shared with three experienced Afghan analysts and two senior western security officials, who concur with the principal findings.

All told, between the free-form and formalized discussions, this group of eight 5-year-olds spent 40 minutes discussing great paintings. Forty minutes! I was prepared to ditch it at any time, but we kept right on going until I felt I detected the beginnings of restlessness. But come on! That's almost as long as a college-level classroom session on art history, and in our version, no one was dozing off. We never made it to the clipboards.
If you don't have a Ph.D. in psychology and lots of time to spare, stay away from tyrants. If you have to deal with tyrants, remember this: Even though they're desperately unhappy, they become arrogant and dogmatic through the exercise of their tyranny. You will rarely get a tyrant to see reason. They live in their own rabid empire. Tyrants like and expect abuse. "Plank on head" is the only language they understand. Don't negotiate, don't accommodate, and don't try to please them. The more you try to do for them, the more it affirms their power of manipulation. It's sad to say, but you should never cut the suckers any slack. It's bound to backfire.

With detached shock, Mesdan realizes that some of the blood is dry and some of it is new.

But $2.5 today, given comparable sales, is a very decent price. I love this location because you can walk to town, the train, Binney Park and Old Greenwich school (even the church across the street if you’re of that persuasion) and, as noted, it’s beautifully made. broker open house is tomorrow and I’ll report back if they’ve installed black lights and painted the master bedroom purple since I last saw it but otherwise, well worth considering.

Thanksgiving when I was younger meant ten hour-long car rides to Maryland, where all my aunts, uncles, and cousins met up for a feast my grandparents presided over. Honestly, I don't remember what we ate--although I know it was classic Thanksgiving fare--but the multitude of cousins running around the house was something I enjoyed. That, and the scrumptious sticky buns my grandmother made the next morning.

As an artistic person, this one is fun for me. The kids enjoy it, which makes my life easier. I would hate to have to force Art on my kids. I would, though, because I feel that education should be well-rounded, and education without The Arts is lacking in cultural importance.

I walk up to Rachel, lying in the ambulance on the stretcher. Her eyes are closed and her chest is moving a little up and down as she breathes weakly. I pull the blanket off her, to find a bandaid covering a huge hole just under her breast bone, where she'd stabbed herself. I gasp, tears fall down my face and onto her cheek. Her eyes flitter open as she feels the drops. The paramedics bring more bandages and medicine to clean the wound. I wait for them to tell me to go away but they don't. I hold her hand as they drive to the hospital. Her sobbing mother sits in the front.

At the time, I felt that a human produced Internet resource catalogue, which involved paying people to catalogue Internet resources into a slowly-expanding searchable and browsable directory, was not only not what we should have been mainly concentrating on, but was also something doomed to become redundant in the near future. Not only was cataloguing the best parts of the Internet an almost impossible task, but the resulting product failed to answer typical searches in some subjects, and also, it was an extremely expensive exercise to employ people to catalogue resources.

Coffee was always hot, and we’d cook tasty foods and eat fruits and discuss how awesome it would be to create a female commune where our men could visit but we, primarily could be left to our own devices to knit and sew and make soap and tie-dye and grow fruits and veggies and let our children pee in the bushes and have red-cheeked meltdowns without a single raised eyebrow.
Look, I know that we all felt a little something, Hipsters can't even deny that despite how underground it was. But still, we are taking this way out of proportion up here.

The tenants in our North Carolina rental probably had more "damage" than us.

It's tough experimenting with sour beer like it is with clean beers because they take so long to age. This is why I've started doing lots of smaller split batch's and 1 gallon batch's. This way I'll have a huge variety...eventually. I love it! I have something like 44 gallons of Sour or Brett beer aging in my house. At some point some of that beer is gonna make it into bottles! I'm actually thinking about using one or two of my 5 gallon kegs for funk and sour beers. Oh boy...what have I got myself into?

Smith isn’t alone. An investigation by the New York Post revealed that another toll booth operator pulled in a whopping $102,670 in 2011, $40K of that money coming in overtime. In total, as the Post notes, there are at least 24 New York and New Jersey workers who have raked in more than $80,000 as “public” workers at a job that requires us to hand them even more of our money.

And now the big boys are computerizing and outsourcing all the white collar jobs to India.

We have been counting down the days to the cast removal since Cowpokette had it put on. It really went by fast. We had our moments. Cowpokette would throw total fits about nothing, and I would just walk away. But she got used to that hot pink body cast. She didn't let it bother her that the other kids could run around and play. She would just hang out and be good. We went to a friend's house and played some home run derby. Cowpokette just played with some sidewalk chalk. The other kids all played on a slide, but that didn't stop her from having a ball. She just had a great attitude about it the entire time. She loved to hang out on the floor with the dogs. She would watch Barbie movies all day long and always have a dog next to her. It was sweet. Okay, so she didn't watch Barbie all day...we colored Barbie too. And we had potty breaks, and story time. Cowpokette also loved to go play at her friend's house. Her friend has a cool Barbie house. And lots of Barbies. Cowpokette talks about how many cool Barbies her friend has. It's so cute. But then it was time for the cast to come off..... Cowpokette was very excited. She kept saying, "I get my cast off?!" She was looking forward to taking a bath. That is all she talked about. This is Cowpokette looking a bit worried and her Doctor. He is a nice guy. Then it came time for the Doctor to cut off the cast. That is when her face really changed. That is her look while he was cutting it off. That "I'm not so sure" look. But it didn't take long to have the cast all cut and pryed open. There it is all cut up. She was still kind of worried. The cast came right off. She was really nervous about moving. She was REALLY stiff. She screamed when we did an x-ray of her leg. She stood on her leg just a little bit while we were there. Her leg is a lot shorter than the other. She has to "walk" on her tippy toes. But she doesn't walk at all. I am just now getting her to stand. I try to support her under her arms, but she just doesn't want to even try.

It is a system of moral principles that affect how people make decisions and lead their lives. Ethics is concerned with what is good for individuals and society and is also described as moral philosophy. The term is derived from the Greek word ethos which can mean custom, habit, character or disposition.

Sadly he was prevented from stating the unarguable fact that if the current situation continues this generation's own children will live to become a minority on their own homeland. It was clear that his opponents were waiting for him to try to make the statement and were under orders to prevent him from saying it. As soon as he began leading up to the point they all started loudly interrupting him with various attacks and diversionary arguments, and regrettably succeeded in distracting him. Their actions show how sensitive this fact is and how vital it is that we get it out to the public, for the establishment do not want it said as they have no defence against it.

Some of the testimony after the expert resource witnesses was pretty over the top, railing against the drug war generally instead of criticizing specific bill provisions, and about a dozen speakers in someone inevitably proved Godwin's Law. But a significant number of (very different kinds of) people showed up at 7:30 in the morning, mostly to criticize the bills.
The value of this photo essay though, is that it transcends the subject of military vehicle design. When push comes to shove, we see the problem, we see that a solution exists. And then we see the British response. Crucially though, we find that it was concocted by senior officers in the Army, devised by British industry, accepted by civil servants, authorised by ministers, approved by the Treasury, endorsed by Parliament (which has a select committee look at it), and lauded by the media.

Jules then demonstrates the break from his identity – he is an assassin, but rather than kill in a context that expects it, he specifically doesn’t. The impulse for this are bullets that should kill him but do not. This could be looked at as religious salvation which brings Jules to a path of penance. I look at it somewhat differently: Jules sees bullets that should kill him and do not, and sees that he is just a role in a structure, with events taking place according to the demands of the structure. He should clearly be shot, but it is necessary for this structure that he remain alive. This is no different from countless movies where major characters are the target of hundreds of bullets at close range, yet somehow the bullets always miss. This is solely because of the position of the roles, a major character shot by minor insignificant characters.

My away from home work has been rough for the last few days. It's been busy and the patients are really ill which always makes my job more stressful. Plus, being Easter weekend, there are a lot of people not happy about being hospitalized and away from their families.

At the risk of going all David Copperfield on you I’ll try and keep this brief – I was born in Port Macquarie, a small town on Australia’s mid north coast. When I finished school, I went to university in Newcastle and completed a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Film. After graduating, I spent the next ten years trying to break into the film industry. On the eve of my 30th birthday, I came to the conclusion that I might never make it as a filmmaker so I better think of another dream career. Becoming an author had always seemed more intimidating than making movies –all those pages and words! – but I figured I should try. It was certainly a cheaper way of telling stories. The idea for Winter’s Shadow was inspired by a sunset jog through a cemetery where I encountered a teenage girl taking photographs. I started thinking about the girl and what if something odd was revealed in the pictures she’d taken and by the time I got home the story was there ready for me to begin writing. Even though I had the idea for the story, getting it into a novel was a tricky and sometimes painful experience. A lot of words make up a book – much more than a screenplay – and I agonised over every single one of them. As soon as the draft was done I sent it out to various literary agents. I was lucky enough to get signed and subsequently be offered a 2 book deal with Pan Macmillan. Winter’s Shadow was published last year (2011) and the sequel Winter’s Shadow is coming out May 1st this year (2012). The sequel expands the mythology introduced in the first book and is a much stranger, darker tale. I’ve just begun outlining the third book which expands the scope even further. Think Lord of the Rings to The Hobbit in terms of scale.

We must realise that Jihad is a pillar of Islam and was described as its peak by Sayyidina Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam). It is the thing, which Allah (Subhanahu Wa ta’ala) in the Qur’an states that gives the Ummah life; indeed Umar ibn al Khattab (ra) stated, “There is no izza (honour) without Jihad”. Hence any misunderstanding of this vital concept would have huge ramifications. Hence, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of Jihad and make clear these corruptions, which have been propagated by the Kuffar, their agent rulers and their “scholars”.

Call God an alien if you want, he did come in a highly polished bronze ship called “amber” in Ezekiel. The truth is he (one in energy of masculine and feminine no sex just a way to express the being) has been watching and knowing our hearts. He cast asunder the middle wall of partisan within us and between us as individuals so that we are all called to be one in spirit with him. Many are called but few are chosen. Many will run to him in this final day and claim their love and he will say, “Get away from me, I never KNEW you”. You say you seek truth.

The "cruel and abhorrent apartheid system" is further exonerated by the following staggering truth. At the start of his BBC documentary series "The War of the World", Harvard historian Niall Ferguson makes the telling statement that the 20th Century was one long war of savagery motivated by racism among other things. What the Japanese did to the Koreans and the Chinese, what the Turks did to the Armenians and the Greeks, what the Russians did to the Slavs and Polish and other minorities, and later to the poor fleeing Germans, what the Nazi's did to the Jews and the Polish and many others, what the British did to Dresden and Hamburg and the Americans to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, what Mao did to his own people, and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, what Saddam Hussein did to the Kurds, what the Hutu's did to the Tutsi's and the Balkan peoples to each other, was in every instance motivated by some form of racism! The attacker viewing his enemy as an inferior race, or as Ferguson alledges, "vermin"! Whether Ferguson's thesis is correct is the reader's to decide, but one obvious fact strikes you if you are an Afrikaner: We did not make his list! We truly feature nowhere in six hours of 20th century sordid savagery! And that while the "racist abhorrent apartheid system" had all the means at its disposal - a pretty mighty army - and while its people had every reason to feel "justified" doing it, considering what happened to colonial Europeans throughout the rest of Africa.

Unfortunately, this post sexual feminist revolution compelled women to enter the work force with this mindset they should not only compete with men but act like them, out earn them and convince themselves they don’t need them. The grand result of this revolution waged by the likes of Gloria Steinem, Kate Millet, Chris Weedon, Bell Hooks and other horrid, male hating women is a generation of barren, single women because the gender roles have been thrown into chaos. Since 1976, the percentage of women in their early 40s who have not given birth has nearly doubled and marriage is on the decline. As Atlantic Kate Bolick wrote “Gloria Steinem said, in the 1970s, “We’re becoming the men we wanted to marry.” I doubt even she realized the prescience of her words.

Y'all, Pod and I have become absurdly attached to those little tree seedlings I got for free about 2 months ago. ALL of them -- all eleven -- have started to bud, and it's become a part of our daily routine to check out each one to see how they have changed from day to day. For a while, it looked like only a few would survive, but in recent days, the remaining 3 that we had written off have started to show signs of life. I think we have to thank this strange spring weather, especially these long, soaking rains that are completely uncharacteristic of Central Texas -- even in the spring -- for the fact that our little seedlings are thriving. Most have multiple leaves, although only one -- the Arizona Ash -- has grown substantially. It's probably twice as big as it was when we first got it and is covered with leaves. Amazing.

Now there was some news back in December that rocked the hip-Jewish world. Matisyahu shaved his beard.

I am reclaiming myself. Trusting my goodness and my divine mission.”

It is very difficult to differentiate between a narcissist and a psychopath. One of the keys to telling the difference is to remember they have very different thinking processes going on in their psyches, but manifest some similar characteristics. The narcissist has a conscience, feels normal emotions and may be a person in a lot of emotional pain, even though some of them inflict a lot of damage on others. Some narcissists can also offer something positive to society. Life would not be as entertaining without comedians and actors who are narcissists trying to get attention. The psychopath has no conscience nor normal emotions. Psychopaths and narcissists have widely differing intentions that manifest in similar behaviors.

For a spinner, Anil Kumble hardly turned the ball much. He did not possess a great amount of turn or variation but relied more on bounce and pace (typically the weapons of medium pacers and not spinners) but even then, this lion-heart from India emerged as one of the most successful bowlers of all time. His unusual action and bowling method made him virtually unplayable on wearing pitches (as Pakistan discovered at Kotla in 99). In a long and gritty career, Kumble revived spin bowling (along with Warne and Muralitharan) and claimed every Indian bowling record in the book. By the time he retired, Kumble was the third most successful bowler in international cricket history.

On Sunday we went to the Ceramic Showcase at the Convention center in Portland. Saw some inspiring work! Off to Long Beach, Washington after that, taking Hwy 30 along the Columbia River to Astoria. It was a lovely, leisurely drive on a perfect sunny day. Our destination was the Adrift Hotel on the beach at Long Beach. The hotel was recently remodeled using the eco-friendly up-cycling ideas. I think that crates screwed to the walls for shelving is not very creative. Reminded me of using orange crates back in the day for our bookshelves. The hotel provided free use of beach bikes (for two hours). Off we went for 1 1/2 hour along the asphalt path through the beach grass. We attempted a ride on the packed sand, but the resistance of the sand, as well as riding into the wind, proved too much for us.

And thirdly, because while some of the media attention geared towards Harry Potter has been about the media attention the books and films have been getting, I am grateful for the critical attention children's literature now gains. All the broadsheet papers now review children's literature and British university English departments frequently have undergraduate modules in children's literature, even those without an Education department; this I think is crucial as children's literature is being viewed from an aesthetic perspective rather than a utilitarian one; that is the pleasure of children's literature is being examined rather than its use in teaching reading.

By the time Rancid finished, it was getting pretty dark, it had stopped raining for the most part (yay!), and you could feel the crowd energy rising. The crowd was definitely made up mostly of Rise Against fans! We stood around waiting, feeling the occasional cool rain drops on our face, breathing in the tons of secondhand marijuana smoke (there were seriously TONS of people smoking weed! I was amazed at the joint to cigarette ratio, since there really weren't many people smoking cigarettes at all. We were even offered some for free, though we turned it down of course. ;-) (Seriously, we did turn it down. Unknown dealer=bad idea!)), hearing the intermittent chants of "Rise Against!", and waiting with excitement. We worked our way right up into the front of the crowd, where we'd have a good view. When they finally came on, the crowd went wild! I was very happy to have the earplugs that we'd brought (always a good idea to have at concerts!). We had a great time, jumping up and down, singing along loudly, and getting bumped into nearly constantly by people. I've never really been in "the pit" at a concert before, and it can get pretty rough. You have to be aware of the people around you, keep your arms up to easily protect your head and upper torso, and not mind being squashed against multiple people! Except for one jerk who literally smashed into people with no care for injury, everyone was really cool though. The worst injuries I got were frequently squished toes and a fairly light elbow to the throat (and in the latter case, I instantly had a complete strangers hand on my shoulder and a concerned query if I was alright. As I said, most people were really cool. :-)). It also helped that there was very little real moshing, and when there was we were careful to stay out of it! At the closest, there was only one person between us and the barrier in front of the stage. It was really cool to have the lead singer actually that close, and singing straight to those of us right in front! :-D We ended up moving to a safer location later on in the show, when the aforementioned jerk moved into our area, but it was still a good spot.

But there I was at the end of the evening standing in front of a capacity crowd in the Maroney Center at SFC waiting for Tim Mcloughlin- writer and editor of the series- to present a plaque to the winner of the 2011 Brooklyn Non-Fiction Reading Series.
So where do we start? Well we can start by hiring a leader – a CEO – to run things. That should be PRIORITY ONE for 2012. It won’t be in time to impact London, but it could be for things going forward. And that expensive, fancy, full of verbiage, job description aside, what the organization really needs is someone with vision; able to hire competent people capable of carrying out the vision; and able to delegate without micromanaging so that things can actually get done.

So what other factors might shed light on the cougar population? According to Dr, Maurice Hornocker, a respected cougar authority, “There may now be more mountain lions (another of the cougar’s many names) in the West than there were before European settlement,” so it makes sense that the cougars might be in the process of expanding its range. (Some estimates put the population of the cougar in the Western United States at more than 30,000.) Also, cougars are extremely adaptable animals. Prior to the arrival of Europeans to the Americas, they occupied virtually every ecological niche. The protection of the cougar and the explosion of deer populations also argue in favor of its expanding range.
When I deleted my Amharic blog, most of my friends were unhappy. However, I couldn’t help it. But then two years later, I created these new blogs, each different from the other. Now, I blog almost daily. And I don’t think I will delete any one of them. But you never know.

I recently got the Ovals Sizzix Die, so now using the oval Embossed Designer Frame is so much easier. No more cutting out the oval shape by hand! The medium sized oval is the perfect size for the outside and the smallest one fits inside the frame. (as does the Wide Oval Punch)

Since he is so much taller than the twins, we mounted his hooks on a 1x4 scrap wood which I painted with leftover paint. His scooter folds up and will fit inside the basket too. These baskets will hold anything!
We headed to Khao San road (the infamous backpacker district) where we joined the thousands of Thais and foreigners in a huge street party. There was music, drinks, delicious food, and torrential water beatings. We had purchased water guns along the way and while we put up a good fight, the buckets of ice water won every time. Aside from the water, there was a clay paste that (mostly Thais) were rubbing on people's faces. Since we'd watched 'No Reservations: Thailand' prior to our trip, we knew to expect this and thus my knee-jerk reaction to smack any stranger who touches my face and neck was suppressed.
Another mystery to me, is why, on the 30th of January, I started posting up my versions of Dickensian Facebook update statuses. Certainly it had something to do with the fact I finally got around to watching "Great Expectations" (the 1946 version) a day or two earlier. But, truth be told, I did have this film recorded for about six months, so it wasn't like it was "Dickens Week" on the TCM channel or anything.

Your brothers and sisters of the stars are flooding the planet in greater numbers, far more than any government of any nation can keep up with. And they could not possibly anyway, because they are basically protected and hidden. So, you say, “Well, when will Disclosure come?” And it comes from the people, again. It comes from that full recognition. And yes, it comes from your star brothers and sisters making their presence known.

All this to set you up for a real simple pasta dish. The simplicity of the dish leaves you with a flavorful experience that is tough to find in anything anymore complex than this recipe. All you would need are two roasting dishes, an eggplant and some garlic. Hey wait ...try to get the best pasta. I like fettucine or linguini :)
So back to my story, I was feeling very tired, very weak, with a sore throat and a throbbing headache starting up… and it was only Thursday… I rifled through the bag looking for this “cold” bottle and found it. I only looked at it long enough to read 쌍화탕 (ssang-hwa-tang) and wonder if I should drink part of it or all of it before I just downed the thing and passed the fudge out. That stuff works miracles. I had to take another pill for the headache later on, but otherwise I slept quite well. By morning I was not completely better, but I felt more like I usually do after a week of misery and fever – i.e. recovering. It didn’t taste too bad when I had it – there is a bit of a sting to the after taste but it’s tolerable. I was pretty desperate and feverish at the time though, so it could be awful for all I know. Apparently you should have 1 bottle a day and it will take care of most mild colds.

I had an epiphany yesterday while driving alone to a pizza shop. (Yes, God speaks to His children at the most ordinary of times.) I've always loved change. I've craved it and even sought after it. In the past decade I've wrestled through the truth that some of my yearnings are steeped in discontentment. But yet I also know I'm simply just fond of newness more than the average person.
To quote Frank Valli and the Four Seasons, “Oh what a night…..” Vince Vaughn on the glass, Jeremy Roenick all choked up and misty eyed, Duncan Keith toothless, Patrick Kane with the game winning goal; Chicago Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup!!! Finally Eric Fergusson can shave his beard and Kathy Hart can shave her armpits (of Chicago’s WTMX Eric & Kathy fame). The only thing better would have been to win it at home.
So my earlier response did not go as far as it really should have. Part of the answer as to why not fairy castles with the Pink Tower is because such activity takes the child away from reality at a time when they most need to connect with what's real. At the 3-6 level, Montessori is very focused on helping the children connect with the real world around them. It's why they are given child-sized brooms and sponges--so they can do these real life things on their own. And why they are allowed to engage in food preparation--so they can do these real life things on their own. The sensorial activities help them connect with the world around them through their senses. And so on. Making fairy castles with the Pink Tower does not help them do a real life thing!
Procter & Gamble (USA) topped the list of largest users with 167 design applications received by WIPO in 2011.

We realize that many people are hoping they will know the date of Christ’s return. In fact for a time Family Radio fell into that kind of thinking. But we now realize that those people who were calling our attention to the Bible’s statement that “of that day and hour knoweth no man” (Matthew 24:36 & Mark 13:32), were right in their understanding of those verses and Family Radio was wrong. Whether God will ever give us any indication of the date of His return is hidden in God’s divine plan.
It’s no secret that we live in a society that encourages materialism. As a matter of fact, often times we identify our own self-worth with what we own. The more we consume, the better we feel. The less we get, the more we feel deprived. What kind of message is this sending to kids and to each other? It’s no wonder that kids often grow up to spend themselves right into debt. Nonetheless, do we express love through buying lots of material things for each other, or do we just become less spiritually connected? As previously mentioned, gift giving can be positive (i.e., it gets us to think outside of ourselves), but I personally believe that our society puts too much emphasis on what we own. Besides, who really needs all that meaningless stuff anyway? It just becomes clutter that most of us don’t quite know what to do with. It’s just a diversion that side tracks us from any real spiritual purpose in life. Eventually, most of it just ends up in a landfill. How good can that be for our planet?

worse than you are being told. Did you know that there are 100 million working age Americans that do not get up in the morning and go to work? No wonder why it seems like there are so many people that do not have jobs! According to the federal government, there are 12.6 million working age Americans that are considered to be “officially” unemployed, but there are another 87.8 million working age Americans that are not working either.

Insoluble fiber, however, draws water into the colon, speeds up intestinal transit time, and results in a softer and larger stool. Wheat bran, which can irritate some cats’ digestive systems, contains insoluble fiber. Carrots, pumpkins, zucchini, sweet potatoes, spinach and celery contain more insoluble fiber than soluble.

I met up with Becky to arrive at head office together and then also met up with Joanne when we (eventually) got to Oxford street after thinking we could walk from Kings Cross to head office in the end we got completely lost and admitted defeat and got on the tube and then had a cheeky bit of food before the event!

Why did we go, knowing all this? It’s mainly for my father. He’s been hankering for a trip to Austria probably ever since he saw The Sound of Music, and in his twilight years, I understand it would mean a lot to him if his grandson came along. So there it is.
Ultimately, my design was just a study of minimal Helvetica compostions on a uniform grid, and there was no way I was gonna clutter the design with stupid mini band photos like Metallica's designer did! I wouldn't have even had room. The Metallica booklet gets a full three spreads, while I had to cram all the lyrics and album info into one, hence three claustrophobic columns.
Well, first of all – as the last verse states, “They are (were) terrible and dreadful..”. Secondly, it was in this same region that the satan-child, Cain, reigned supreme as Sargon of Akkad – click here to learn more. It was in this same region where the revengeful Cain established the first false gods, and by doing so obscured the simplistic purity of God’s wisdom on earth. The many false fables and myths that originated in that region, and which later infected the minds of men in other parts of the world, is today known as mythology.

What he needs now is more maturity (as a writer and person), and a better editor, to strip the chaff from his writing. Given how excellent some of his wordwork was in certain parts of Airplane, that would not have been - nor should it be - difficult.

Yeah. Miss Responsible was SO FREAKING ENGROSSED in writing this here blog post on the ACTUAL 2 month anniversary of being here that she left her kindle sitting on the seat next to her on the train. Talk about dedication to my writing.. Needless to say, I was a little preoccupied when I got home that night. And pretty darn sad, too. Which actually led to a random bout of homesickness – the best kind – the kind where all it took was seeing a black lab on the train platform to send big huge tears from my eyes and big huge sobs from my mouth. But I was glad for the catharsis; I don’t think I had cried in over a month.. and sometimes you just gotta.

If the veneer of 70,2% is stripped away, we see that the combined 412 542 failed and passed pupils who didn't receive university endorsement, now have to face two problems. Firstly, the economic environment in South Africa is extremely youth unfriendly as the discussion report "Confronting youth unemployment: policy options for South Africa" by National Treasury established. Firms are hesitant to hire pupils coming out of Grade 12 due to their lack of technical skills.
In fact, if you go back to Connolly's terrific book, you'll see that the pram is only one of the many Enemies of Promise.

The end game of this CIA-created scenario is not clear, yet.

It is like the Star Wars se-up of a corrupt Galactic senate (The Cabal) going to war with a Separatist faction of its own creation (the CIA) with clone soldiers fighting fabricated battles to bring the Galaxy under martial rule (Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran).

Stanley Baker stars as Jack Truman, a CID detective investigating a series of fire attacks in the city who is suddenly transferred against his wishes to help deal with the burgeoning problem of young offenders – or rather, to try to stop them before they become repeat offenders. The Dearden and Relph films are classic examples of trying to have your cake and eat it – not just using popular genre and star names to bring audiences to watch difficult subjects, they also try to give the impression of neutrality by trying to show ‘both sides’ of every issue. However, they are usually loading their arguments, or at least are clearly doing so by modern standards, just as Truman’s motives becomes increasingly compromised by his attraction to Cathie.
Yesterday I finally received word from the attorney I engaged: he is not interested in taking the case. That’s not beyond what I expected except I didn’t think it would take him so long to answer.
4. Eat at the Clover Grill. As the Tex part of @TipsyTexan would say, "it is legit." Also, I love the way they marketed their ice cream. Go ahead. Have 9 inches of fun and yum. However, be aware that much of the marketing in New Orleans in overly sexualized, and given what I study, I have a pretty high tolerance. Just be aware that it isn't kid friendly, and referring to sexual acts or body parts in all contexts is pretty normal. Also, don't be surprised if you see half naked men and women in the streets at all hours.
God poured out His wrath for my sins, but His Son took it in my place. The debt that was owed for my sins was paid – but Jesus Christ the Righteous is the One Who paid – and He paid it in full! “It is finished,” He said, and, because He was telling the Truth, I live! I have eternal Life. I am justified before God!

One of the downfalls of man is that he protects himself by wrapping himself in his own preconceptions of his own self, and this manifests in many ways, it can manifest in a person seeing himself or herself as a picture conjured up in his/her mind that isn’t real, it can manifest in the desire to prove oneself to the world, it can manifest in various forms of denial (like denying the reality of one’s situation) and so on and so forth. But the manifestations are secondary to the cause.

At that point, cooperate with law enforcement or they can make your life pretty miserable. "Where's the gun?" let them have it if they ask - and they will... "Please wait over here" you should... "Do you have any identification on you?" give it to them... "What was the mugger wearing when he ran off?" tell them. These are the folks who will be writing the initial and possibly additional reports. Of course, they may not like that you won't answer more specific questions about the actual incident, but it's your right not to... and if you're otherwise cooperative with them, they'll remember that.

The Miami Dolphins were next up at #8. Needing a quarterback to groom for the future trumped the fact that there was bevy of talent still on the board. Ryan Tannehill is certainly talented, but only time will tell if he’s top-10 talented. With pass rushers like Melvin Ingram and Quinton Coples available. With potential Brandon Marshall replacement Malcolm Floyd sitting there, Miami choose Tannehill. Athletic and strong armed, his physical attributes aren’t as much of a question as his experience. Tannehill started only 19 games at quarterback for Texas A&M. He did do so under the guidance of Mike Sherman. Sherman just happens to be the new offensive coordinator for the Dolphins. Miami is banking on that familiarity and his raw skills equalling eventual success. Unlike top two picks Luck and RG3, Tannehill will likely start his NFL career on the bench.

I started writing my current work-in-progress because of something my dad said. Or, rather, something my dad wrote. He keeps a blog where he chronicles family history, his own opinions, and a little bit of everything else. In one entry, he wrote about the magic of books and how they saved him when he was a poor boy in Eastern Kentucky. They took him places, into other countries and other times. I decided to write about a little boy in Eastern Kentucky who discovers a magic library. That's all I had, really. Little boy character based mostly on my dad meets magical library in the woods. Notice, I didn't say anything about a time-traveling library.

How is it that people with a same sex attraction feel attacked and condemned by religious representatives? Because, regardless of whether anyone wants to admit it or not, they equate the homosexual act and behavior with the homosexual person! They see no difference, but outwardly, against the public, the church would be happy to demonstrate that they distinguish between the concepts of ”sin” and ”sinner”. If not, the whole Christian concept is at stake here. I mention Christianity because that is the religion that most clearly has set as a key issue to exterminate homosexuality from the surface of the Earth! And the evangelical Christianity is all aware of this.
Blanketed by clandestine darkness, Corina outlines her plan. "We have to be seen together, often and publicly, you OK with that." He is, his crush on Cindy waning as he gets to know Corina better.
She heard me loud and clear.

Rinzler risks aiming at trying to sound trendy and winding up like the preachers who marketed denim-clad bibles to the Jesus People in the hippie era; that is, packaging tradition for mass appeal. However, Rinzler's audience like that of Jesus or of the Buddha lives in cities more often than in monasteries! Rinzler wants to go into the dive-bars, the cyber-cafes, the cubicle, and to show how Buddhism can calm, can soothe, and can rouse.
The incident last month before President Barack Obama’s trip to the Summit of the Americas in Colombia involved Secret Service and U.S. military members who allegedly consorted with prostitutes.
Among other hilarious things happening in February, I decided to take up Tae Kwon Do with one of my bridesmaids, Becca (or as I like to call her, Fecca Buerch). I know you’re probably thinking that it is really random, but actually Becca and I had wanted to take on TKD for a while and Groupon presented us with the opportunity! Upon our first class at TKD, I loved it so much and was so into it I literally almost passed out. I never realized how good of a workout it was and I absolutely LOVE IT! I thought some of you may not believe me that I did TKD, so again here is a photo of me in my get-up for proof. Pretty legit, huh? We wanted to continue our studies at Master Chong’s but unfortunately it is almost just as expensive as a car payment every month, so we respectfully declined. Becca and I did however learn how to count to ten in Korean and learned our first moves in the poomse! Go us!

On the other hand facilities management people are responsible for energy, cooling, lighting and other aspects of a data center. It’s their responsibility to ensure that sufficient supporting infrastructure is always available to support the data center. As we have seen that power consumption is linearly related to device’s utilization there need to be synergy between IT management and facilities disciplines. However that is not the case. IT capacity planners analyze the impact of business demand on underlying infrastructure and forecast the capacity requirements. The impact of forecast on the supporting Infrastructure is not in the scope of their work. On the other hand, facilities teams usually don’t consider the impact of business demand on the supporting infrastructure. To summarize both disciplines work in isolation and rarely feed information to each other and this results in situations where you run out of power and data center migration becomes the need. Other than financial implications this impacts business services and unnecessary overhead which could have been avoided.
Vicky was sweet and filled the canister with Godiva chocolates. I enjoyed learning a little more about Vicky and the products she likes based on the gifts I received.

This week, I was fortunate enough to meet Sharyl, from Sharyl's Jewelry. We generally converse over email and it was so nice to actually meet in person. We met in a local park and were able to chat while we watched the kiddo play. It was a wonderful way to spend a morning.
So, if your favorite fascist-supporting white male writer is “un,” how do you make him viable? Oh, I know! Make him gay. Ish. But this is typical leftist crap. “Feminists” champion women’s rights . . . unless that right is to be a stay-at-home-mom or any other role that fits their “traditional gender role” tripe. Oh, and it’s tripe. When “feminists” aren’t trumpeting the rights of women to . . . well, never marry, have countless abortions, and receive “free” birth control, they simply ignore any and every abuse of women around the world.
The first step that I’d like you to focus on before you start making any kind of decisions is What is important to you? I’m going to tell you the order of importance that I personally have in my mind. Faith, family, Business. That’s the order that I live by.
After my lovely trip to London I went to Blackpool with my best-friend EVER...We spent all day at Pleasure Beach, the rides were really good and at the end we both felt dizzy and sick. That means we had a VERY GOOD time at the theme-park lol. We went into the Dungeons, Ballroom and went to the top of Blackpool Tower. It was a very enjoyable experience, I'm soo glad I went with my best-friend!!!

There was Vicky - slim, blonde and with a smile that could light up the geography room. Two decades later, I was still comforting male friends pining over her.

Forgiving the minor garbled sound, I absolutely LOVED this release. It is, in my opinion, the best offering of a Toho film I have gotten from the Tokyo Shock label. I hope that I can get my hands on their release of GODZILLA VS. MEGALON, due later this month. By all means, if you haven’t done so yet, GRAB THIS DVD! IF for nothing else, the AIP audio track is the main reason to get this. Considering how downplayed this was, you might want to get it as soon as you can! The extras are fantastic as well. They more than make up for the lack of an AIP video edit (which again, as far as I remember was NOT all that different than the original cut).
My sense of fashion always revolved around what I could wear based on the physical aspects of my body. No more and no less. The idea of changing my body shape either meant eating less and exercising more, or with the high metabolism I had, just eating more to gain weight to my skinny self.

Why did I enslave the world, you ask? Were the Republican candidates too mean to me? Fiddlesticks! The problem was the average Republican voter. You folks at those debates hollering at poor Wolf Blitzer that he should let that uninsured guy die. Or shouting down Juan Williams, when he asked about race-baiting in South Carolina. And you just about lost your minds, whenever crazy old Ron Paul said something about maybe not invading a new country every year. You were out there talking about automatic weapons and bombing Iran and those darn gay folks, and how it should have been Sarah Palin running in 2012... and somebody, some actual, intelligent human being had to try to get your vote. I did my best.
13) The Fat Duck (Bray, England)
“The achievements, thus far, are meaningful as we had undertaken thorough planning. In the third quarter, we attained 5.8 per cent (Gross Domestic Growth) and (God willing) possibly five to six per cent (growth) for 2011,” the prime minister said when closing the BN Youth Job Fair Grand Finale 2011 here today.
I don’t remember if I asked my sis-in-law whether she’d be telling her Mom and Dad about the autopsy results. I know she never told them, and what I found very strange was that my mother-in-law never asked. I couldn’t imagine having lost my son and not wanting to know how he’d died, but she never asked me and I never brought it up. To this very day I don’t believe she knows. Again a lesson in how everyone is different.
Emails are apparently not difficult to intercept, and so this raises the question of whether or not sending an unencrypted email represents a public disclosure of its content. Given the widespread use of email to send confidential information the assumption by most people was that it does not represent a public disclosure. The circumstances in which material on a website is a public disclosure is probably of less significance to most organisations. However there was clearly a need for guidance on how accessible (easy to find) a website needs to be before its contents can be deemed available to the public.

The meal was ending, and an uncomfortable silence descended upon us. We had only agreed upon dinner, and we both didn't know what to do next. Christmas Eve was approaching and he told me he was going to be spending it alone.
If we read the testimonies of the Apostles in Acts and the New Testament books, we find that they differ from one to another in the graces of their Spiritual gifts in some ways, but they seemed to be functioning a lot in most of the Gifts of the Holy Spirit. They also loved their Lord who died for them so much, and they gave their lives for Jesus Christ till the end of their lives.

First it had to be bright enough so she could use it to see with her failing eyesight, but not so bright that it was the brightness of a regular lamp. I searched high and low for just the right nightlight. I went to stores where I tried out high priced lights, and I went to drugstores where I found moderately priced night lights. But, none of them fit the bill.
I think my eyes started to open to the prospect of me having a future in the music industry when I began to sign my records, but at the moment this whole experience is still very surreal to me and I’m still coming to terms with what I’ve achieved so far! The real wakeup call however, would have to be being featured in TILLATE magazine and MIXMAG. These are two publications I’ve been reading since I was 17 so to see myself picked from thousands to be featured is truly amazing.
I decided to take this blog in a different direction and while I may post here from time to time, I will mostly be posting on my new blog, Making My Way to Healthy.
This issue affects the MOSS sites to be rendered fine. The good thing of this that it’s very small fix to apply on the master page to have your SharePoint sites rendered correctly – you need to set the IE7 compatibility explicitly.

I had already watched the Victor & Rolf documentary last year, but this year I caught Chanel and Jean Paul Gaultier. Especially the latter made quite an impression as Jean Paul Gaultier is just about the nicest person in fashion. Unlike many other fashion houses, they create everything in the Jean Paul Gaultier building in Paris. Everything from buttons to special kinds of crocheting. It's very impressive. The documentary comes at time when I received a postcard from a very dear reader of mine.
recently we’ve been calling them “HAARP clouds”.. long ribbed cloud formations like ripples of water….. up until this point it was speculation.. BUT….. here we see these HAARP clouds listed in a HAARP MIT researchers public files from MIT…… check it out.. you decide… and make SURE to walk the parent directory !!!
And why is everyone always so angry and annoyed at the other person? It’s just as much your own damn fault for moving in the opposite direction as the other guy. I know, you think, "everyone should dodge the same way as me". But that’s being a little egocentric, no? Granted sometimes both of you end up laughing about it. And it becomes a grand story to tell.
Unfortunately she hasn’t pleased everyone. The Aborigines were furious when she danced on Ayres Rock, which is a sacred monument in their ancient culture. They likened her performance to “defecating on the steps of the Vatican” and demanded her immediate repatriation. Chastened by their disapproval, Alizee was at pains to deny that she had shown any disrespect.

All I can say is even if you have to save up for a few months, it’s worth it in the long run. I pay $35/month right now, plus tax which brings the total up to $38.33. For that I get unlimited data, web, and text plus 300 minutes a month. $49 will get me 1200 minutes, and $62-65ish will bring unlimited everything. I’ll never go back to a contract phone again.

Well, that is all for today!
Nonetheless, I did a fair amount of work on Dunkin' and because I am quick-witted and know virtually every joke that's ever been uttered my brand of humor (such as it is) matched the tonality of Dunkin' Donuts in those days and I was welcomed into the fold.
Well, let me try to come up with something I liked about tonight’s episode. Um…uh…I got nothing. I usually like Naomi’s storylines, but her sudden affection for PJ came out of nowhere. Also, Adrianna continues to be alive and that is just not acceptable. But I do like that Vanessa tried to make everyone believe Ade’s crazy side had returned. So what did you guys think of tonight’s episode? Leave your TwoCents in the comments below!
A fine day was had by all.
I didn’t write this review as an Animation Wednesday because I’m not sure if I’d recommend Durarara!!- yet. The potential is there, but frankly, there’s not enough there yet for a solid judgement one way or the other. There’s plenty of individual things to like here, but so far it lacks the kind of hook that pulls me back weekly for a show. It also includes sequences involving online discussions of events, presumably between the characters, but the various screen names and unclear levels of understanding of how well those involved know each other render them nigh-impenetrable. All in all, it’s an interesting start, and I hope it goes somewhere good, because the potential is there.
I really need to finish The Evening News by Arthur Hailey. My voracity for reading comes in spurts. Sometimes, the desire just stalls for a while.

I can feel a difference and I know it’s as much the exercising that I’m doing as it is the diet regimen. Of course I miss bread (carbs are allowed, but in small doses), but what I miss most is fruit. No, fruit isn’t forbidden, but it does have a lot of sugar and therefore not as important as veggies. The cleaner diet that I’ve been eating over the past two weeks has had some good side effects, though. My face seems clearer, there haven’t been any bouts of heartburn (with the exception of eating an entire, raw bell pepper my second day into the program), I haven’t had major sugar crashes sucking all of my energy and I haven’t had to deal with that uncomfortable, my-pants-are-too-tight feeling from eating too large of a meal – Note: This feeling will happen if you drink boatloads of water right before eating. It goes away quickly.
Seventh, as a result of point six, this election really and truly is (imho) the most important election in the last fifty years. We are standing at the edge of a precipice, and there is little time for turning back. Either our next president cuts programs, agencies and spending, or we go over the edge. This is not a time for merely standing on the sidelines. This is not a time for merely watching and hoping. This is a situation. ”Houston, we have a problem.” We must make drastic changes, and I firmly believe that any one of the GOP candidates will do a better job in Washington than Obama has done. We do not have a choice. We have a duty, and sometimes the duty of an American is a difficult one. Sometimes there’s not a “good choice” for getting out of a pinch. Sometimes we have to be willing to make tough decisions, and without a doubt, if it comes down to Obama and a not-so-conservative candidate, we must actually choose between the lesser of the two evils. God will change this world, and each election year where He gives us an opportunity to prevent immediate self-destruction, we must take that opportunity as He is continuing to do a greater work in our culture. And culture-building will make a difference.
Please do not keep this to yourself.
However, here in South Africa, it seems that those people don't quite exist yet, and that medical 'developments' are running a vastly different course, if not a whole different race.
I must admit that cutting all of the tiny little holes in the piece of card did challenge me, and there are a couple of places where I didn’t cut quite carefully enough and it tore, however I love the overall look of it. I backed the cutout on a piece of red handmade paper and glued the whole lot to a plain white card. I printed out the greeting on the front as my handwriting leaves a lot to be desired!

I found these musicians over at hitRECord.org. Been hanging out there whenever I get a few minutes lately, mostly listening to mix of interesting music. HitRECord.org is "an open collaborative production company" (founded by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) where anyone can share their ideas & creations. Find an idea, make something, other folks then get inspired to riff off of that creation ... and the ball just keeps rolling. Everybody feeds off each other's muses and all sorts of fascinating stuff happens.

We eventually get to the check-in point which in a community centre, and has a roof and some heat, and hot drinks and snacks. We’re greeted by an extremely camp man, with too much joy for this dull and rainy day, and we’re then told that we have a choice to make. There are no seats left, and we can either have purple wristband that allow us guaranteed access – standing-room only – at the front of the stage, or standby wrist bands which I think means that if any invited guests don’t turn up, we can have their seats. We choose purple, I haven’t queued that long to ‘maybe’ get in.
As we approached Progressive Field, I tipped my cap to Bob Feller and dug through my pockets for the tickets that had been printed forty-five minutes prior. The National Anthem was being sung and the pyrotechnics crew was shaking off some of the rust that had accumulated over the prior winter months.

In the forty-first minute of an FA Cup tie with Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday 17th March, 23-year-old Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed to the ground with no-one around him. It was immediately apparent that something serious had happened. The game stopped, later to be abandoned, as emergency medical staff ran onto the pitch. He had suffered cardiac arrest. The other played looked onwards. The Spurs player Rafael van der Vaart fell to his knees and started praying whilst a defibrillator was used to try to restart Muamba’s heart. One cardiologist who was at the game as a fan ran onto the pitch to assist. This doctor accompanied Muamba, Bolton manager Owen Coyle, club captain Kevin Davies and the Bolton and Spurs medical staff to the London Chest Hospital where his treatment continued.
So, not a fun time, though certainly could have been worse and I'm equally definite that, if all goes well next week, this pain, and the discomfort ahead will be worth it in the end. I have to admit to some degree of excitment at getting things sorted out and the, hopefully, positive impact it will have on my life. I just have to get through the next few weeks and months and get myself back to normal, or, better than that in fact.
and when we are done
Next up was The Kernel and Brew Wharf Collaboration made with a trio of super alpha, pacific jade and sorachi ace hops. I liked it but some felt that the sorachi overwhelmed the other two hops.
The difficulty I face with living with two hard-gainers is obvious: They need to consume as many calories as possible in order to maintain and/or increase their weight, when I am doing the opposite. Well, not quite the opposite, I certainly do not “limit” my calories but I do try to eat portions that more reasonable in size than those for a person who is consuming 5000 calories a day! Thankfully, the three of us are all meat-eaters and our nutrition plans allow us all to eat as much naturally fed/raised meat as we like. I am an avid hunter and therefore we have access to wild game year-round. The challenge, is that all of the other good stuff that is in our home is off-limits to me. Wouldn’t I LOVE to eat lasagna and shepherds pie a few times a day! lol
My third working space is the dining room, which is pretty much surrounded on all sides by book cases overflowing with books, a large table, which in seconds can morph from being a recognisable dining table to a cluttered mess, littered with paper, notebooks, files and laptop, which only I can make sense of!

Another reason is that some people assume that because it’s number one, it’s probably a real hit, but as for me I had mixed feelings about the movie. When it comes to books with themes deriving from a post-apocalyptic idea, the book will always be more powerful than when it’s formed into a film. Obviously the story has to be condensed in order to fit the typical 2-2.5hr time frame, and that is where you lose many aspects of the story. Not only that, towards the end you just start looking at the time wondering when it’ll be over.
I'm looking forward to incorporating this image into the assemblage-book. I found that I have a real affinity for the trickster and am curious to see what the finished piece looks like.
I ordered each hen a different color saddle. They were just too cute. These seem to be well made, and I only paid $5.00 per saddle, including freight. Here's where I ordered them from:
Once you’ve marinaded your tempeh for a bit preheat a cast iron skillet over medium to medium high heat with about a tablespoon of peanut oil, (or any oil will work). Throw in your tempeh slices (save that marinade!) and cook for about 5 minutes. Then put in about half of your marinade and flip your slices. Cook for about 5-10 minutes more until the marinade is about gone, and put them rest of your marinade in (and flip your slices). Cook until the marinade has disappeared and the tempeh is nice and browned, but not burnt (maybe 5-10 minutes more). You’ll probably want to stand by those slices flipping and stuff so that they don’t stick.

The woodwork in the rooms is interesting, the tree house concept sort of faery-like, but in the end the consensus was that the place is way overpriced at R750 per person, dinner and breakfast included. The folk running it are friendly and engaging, but are clearly in need of some professionalism.

Can't wait to run into Fuzz this summer and be thanked for being me. I just realized I never told him I created this because of him. Guess I need to do that! Hope this is something you find you can use.
I painted my frame cream color. Then I added my mother's name to the frame. This was the first thing I glued to my wreath.Then I made a regular old bow out of purple ribbon. I glued it just below the frame and added a flower to the middle of the bow. Then I just glued on flowers til I got it looking the way I wanted. I added a bit of bowdabra bow wire to the top for hanging it.

In the interest of being seen as fair-minded, bipartisan, ecumenical, unbiased, and an all-round decent American, I have been searching my mind for things about America that President Barack Obama likes.
I’ve written about this topic before. But in the light of the recent take-over bid of the last form of free news (the Internet), I feel it is imperative to repost these critical news items. Most Americans are completely unaware of this new law and are completely unaware of the complete tyranny within them. This new law, called the National Defense Authorization Act 2012 , is so treacherous that Democratic leaders such as Carl Levin (Chairman of the Armed Services Committee) were stunned and outraged by it. The Act is so treacherous that the ACLU, normally Obama’s greatest ally, said, “President Obama’s action today is a blight on his legacy because he will forever be known as the president who signed indefinite detention without charge or trial into law.”
I tend to think that one could fall away and remain in that state as long as that person refuses to repent and turn away from their sin to be renewed. The book of Revelation tells us that many will turn away so I am not to far off in my belief.
Can any "ethical" "professional" journalist contradict himself and make such a fool of himself in public? Have these people no self-respect or respect for the thousands upon thousands of people raped and murdered since their Governments helped put the ANC in power? Or are they just too shy to admit that they had funded and supported a murderous ruthless terrorist organisation?

So what's it like? Actually, pretty damn good - and nobody is more surprised than me. It's sweetish and malty with a long bitter finish and a proper, lacing head. It won't set any hophead's hair on fire, but It's a decent 'brown' session beer. Importantly, it doesn't taste like homebrew - I'd be happy to sup this down the pub. For some of the night, anyway. I forgot to take the original gravity, but it's something in the neighbourhood of 4%, though anyone reading my tweets on friday night may have thought I was on something stronger.
My response to judgment may be short and rude. “I find you particularly masculine”. “Fuck off”. Actually, at the moment this is an aspiration. I have not got there yet. I get upset, or I withdraw. It is possible for me to improve my sense of self-worth and entitlement, to make it more appropriate. I am entitled that you keep your judgment to yourself, and use the correct name and pronouns. And, in one case when the woman later revealed her own vulnerability, I could open and relate.
Are they different from you? Yes! is the somewhat surprising answer. And look! This is from when Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli were really young and huge TV superstars. Next, it's Farrah talking about being famous and worshiped. One girl says she loves Farrah "because she looks like my Barbie doll!" Also: girl stars speak out about random things! And Kristy McNichol comes out against child abuse:

Quite how this will manifest itself is interesting given the fact that we only have five league fixtures left! Rather than this I suspect most of the focus will be on money and the contrast between our frugal, penny wise neighbours and the way they’ve enhanced their squad with money found down the back of Bill Kenwright’s sofa whilst we’ve splashed cash like water in pre hose pipe ban days and paid over the odds for all and sundry. There are examples which back this up I’m afraid. Nikica Jelavic, a transfer window signing has scored six goals for Everton in ten appearances, Andy Carroll, who cost over four times as much, has seven in 41 games! No doubt the subject will have added resonance because of Thursday’s announcement that Damien Comolli, who had a big say in our transfer targets, is to leave the club?
There are times when only a Janet Evanovich will do, and a rainy Maine day usually is one of them. She’s written so many of her signature comedy-romance-thrillers—almost forty, at last count—that if you haven’t tripped over one of them already you will soon. And when that day comes you’d be well advised to stay right there on the floor and start reading.
After washing out the stabilizer and setting the fins aside to dry I was all set to sew them onto the fish body. I couldn’t find one of the pectoral fins. So back to the sewing machine to redo the missing fin. Usually when this happens I find the lost piece as soon as I finish the replacement but not this time.

I'm fighting my sleepiness with a cup of instant coffee. It does serve its function in that capacity. I haven't replaced the coffeemaker yet. There's been no opportunity for it yet. It will wait a while as long as I have the instant coffee, I just have to get a better brand. Much as I dislike drinking it, I'm sure that will make a difference.

We ordered Welsh Rarebit (it was warm and contained cheese – an easy choice) and pints of Guinness, and squeezed ourselves into a tiny table in the corner, as the unconscious beast was blocking the way to about three tables, and we didn’t have the heart to wake him.
*He is currently sleeping from 8 to 8. We've had some weird days and nights lately due to those stupid molars coming in.

Writing is something I feel I must do. It is the only thing I feel I “must” do. I trust that it is by design of some great positive energy beyond me because, no matter what, I always wind up writing about it.
According to an account written by the The Baltimore Sun's Don Markus, an van with a Bud Light logo carrying beer for pre-game party ran over a fire hydrant. The accident set off a chain reaction that ruptured the water main for the basketball arena.

I painted the blocks with acrylic paint and used ModPodge to add the Basic Grey paper from the Indian Summer line.

I finished off the piece with a few buttons I found on the clearance rack at Michael’s.
Well that's it Christmas is over, just got to get New Years eve out of the way and we can hopefully have a good beginning to the new year as the end of this one has been pants. Paul has had so much bad news over the past fortnight that I feel what we need is to go to sleep and wake up in 2012.

I am receiving such delicious requests for imagery that delights me, and I am having fun trying to keep some circular motif within each design to go behind the hands. A few more logs have been brought indoors in preparation for clocks to come and Tui has the arm-aching task of sawing clock-slices from the logs.
I had a problem finding red and blue papers to match though, because it's colours I never use together, and never buy red papers, but I found the red one in an old paper pad that I think came free with a magazine months and months ago, and the blue patterned and plain papers are from a 12x12 pad that I got in The Works a while ago (same time as I bought the white paint I used yesterday:). They are by Kit 'N Kraft and I must admit that they are not very good quality (a bit on the thin side), but at £2.99 for 25 sheets of 12x12, they were a bargain, so I got 3 different pads lol. I would of got more but there was only 3 different ones.

Please check back soon for an update, I apologize for not updating since the first of January. January, as you can imagine, was extremely hard and we were so ready to flip the calendar to FEBRUARY. February was a month filled with so many sweet family moments and for that we are grateful especially after the 2 months we had just come out of. I can't believe we are already 9 days into March and am just not sure where the month of February went. I promise, coming soon......an update (and pictures of course!!!) of our family during the months of January and February.

The last thing I want is for someone to come to my blog and feel like my life is, in any way, better or more productive or more beautiful than theirs. Because it's not. We are the same. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that you have it WAY more together than I do. The important things, I have to remind myself, are to love what I do, take care of my family, and serve others. If I'm having an "I'm the janitor" kind of day I'm not going to go out of my way to make it look like I have it all together, because it's okay if people think you're the janitor. I still have to work on "kinda liking it", but hopefully this is a small step.

Most girls don’t want to be pretty anymore even if they understand what it is. It is ironic that 40 years of women’s liberation has succeeded only in turning women into a commodity. Something to be used up and thrown out.
Peeling back the years, I find more records of vice in San Samuele. Giuseppe Tassini, the Venetian historian, tells of a certain Orsa Diedo committing adultery with a local clergyman while her husband was away in Corfu in the 1380s. The same clergyman soon after seduced a Lucia Barbarigo. In 1468, Tassini notes, it was necessary to take legal action against the whores who had invaded the streets between San Samuele and Santo Stefano.

But simmering inside me these past couple of months has been a personal crisis that I had no choice but to finally address. I hesitate to write about this here because it has the potential to offend, but I imagine others have dealt with this same anxiety before, and sometimes it’s nice to hear that another soul can identify with your experience, right? So, here goes:

For the first time in a long time, I feel like it's really Friday. Like I accomplished a lot this week and I earned a Friday. I think I'll use this weekend to get some more work done, maybe even be proactive and get some of next week's tasks accomplished. Or, maybe I'll take a break :)

Faced with revolution in the streets, strikes, civil unrest and the sheer terror and murder practiced by Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC), the white government simply capitulated in order to achieve "peace." Westerners need peace. They need order and stability. They are builders and planners. But what we got was peace of the grave for our society.
After riding all the rides (some more than once), we finally decided to call it a night around 9pm. At this point, we were all filthy, tired, sore and hungry! But we made the teenagers happy and heaven forbid you have grumpy teenagers! Jon and I had fun too! It was nice to be able to go and spend time at a park like that and not have to ride the bumper boats and kiddie rides while trying to avoid meltdowns from the little kiddies.

So iIf you’re not sure if you or someone you know has Anti-Government Phobia, one thing to look for is a personal grudge against the federal government. Some of the reactions to the propaganda spread by the patriots cause the patient to “imagine hidden links between unrelated events…weaving these…distortions of reality into a complex delusional web…leading straight to the federal government.” With any more exposure the patient then, supposedly, shows signs of paranoia as they withdrawal from reality with a powerful “us against them” mentality.

A story on May 24, "Pa. liquor often cheaper than in neighboring states," was an example of sloppy analysis and virtual propaganda. Of course, you can find instances when Pennsylvania prices might be cheaper on a particular item. With the 18 percent Johnstown tax, though, prices won't be cheaper overall or cheaper all the time.

PS. The issue of Jews as a minority group can be addressed without explicitly calling them by name. E.g. by discussing how to deal with ethnic minority groups in general. I've done so before, and I'll get back to this. This is a way of keeping the berserk emotions of the chimpanzee crowd in check. Of course, sooner or later someone will bring up the Jews (be it the husband or the wife) if it's an open Internet debate. The brains of all the participants subsequently switches into red alert mode and nobody's able to think clearly anymore.

The 19 halberdiers are enough for four stands of Spears, leaving three extra figures--almost enough for a fifth element of Spears. I have another three figures left over from my original set, so that's enough for nearly six new elements of Spears. And if I include a standard-bearer, that leaves me just one figure short. By the way, the reason I want to have an even number of this element is because in HotT, a second rank of Spears adds a combat bonus to the Spears element in front of it. Therefore, six new elements is better than five, which means I need another figure or two.

Tom Wright for Everyone:
This morning I just typed "magic systems" into the search line on Google and found this great article from Brandon Sanderson. I've never read any of his books, though I think Mistborn is on my TBR list. This article mentions his first experience on a panel at Worldcon on the topic of "How does the magic work?" His first thought was "it has to have rules." But everyone else on the panel adamantly disagreed, stating that with rules comes a loss of wonder. Well, in trying to defend his stance, and in reflecting later on the alternative position, he came up with this law:
70 years ago today, the United Services Organization (U.S.O.) established its Camp Shows division. (Note that this was over two months before Pearl Harbor. It was already pretty clear where events were headed). Vaudeville had already died nearly a decade earlier. Its biggest stars now worked in films and or in radio; of the thousands of other performers, those who hadn’t prematurely retired were now hanging on by their thumbs. While it’s become well-known history that stars like Bob Hope, Al Jolson, Martha Raye, and practically everybody else began entertaining troops in our theatres of war in WWII, it’s probably lesser known that the U.S.O. employed countless out-of-work former vaudevillians: singers, dancers, comedians, acrobats, magicians, etc etc etc. By 1944, the U.S.O. had over 3,000 “clubs”, making it by far the largest vaudeville circuit that had ever existed.
If you read the book I sent you and Kim, you’ll understand why he goes by the name of his deceased twin brother, Jessie. The difference being, he spells it differently on purpose, as he’s not the real Jessie Garon Presley. It’s the same reason that Aron is misspelled on the grave @ Graceland. His name his entire life was Aron, not Aaron – as on the grave marker. He’s too superstitious to have put his real name on a grave that he’s not in.
He then went on to oversee the deployment of other officers in the 1990s, including Jim Boyling's spying on Reclaim the Streets and Pete Black's undermining of anti-racist groups including justice campaigns like that of Stephen Lawrence's family.

One of the first wraparound covers in comics, this George Perez confection is too much for just one facing! In this story, the original seven Justice Leaguers become mind-controlled by the Apellaxians, their very first foes, and the subsequent members are forced to battle the founders. The highlights of this cover for me are Green Arrow in the lower corner, taking aim at Batman above and Flash smacking the snot out of his buddy Elongated Man! The low points are Aquaman, clearly about to get flung aside by Red Tornado and… seriously, Black Canary and Hawkman against Superman? Yeah, good luck with that.
Higher compression ratio. Here, we are limited by autoignition of the gasoline – knock. That is, if the gasoline engine compression is above about 10.5, unless the octane number of the fuel is high, knocking combustion occurs. This is annoying and if persistent, damage to the engine can occur. Thus, gasoline engines are limited in their efficiency by the inability of the fuel to smoothly burn in high compression ratio engines.

In addition, slow aid delivery gives the international community in general a bad name. The UN and NGOs get flak in the media. Our donors get suspicious and edgy. We get given less money.

3. Look for stretchy fabrics. Fabrics that have even a small percentage of lycra (the skirt I have on today has just 3%) have significantly more give than those without. A little stretch can make the difference between 'fitted' and 'tight.' There's certainly no point in wearing a comfy empire top if you're stuffed into your skirt.

Again Colonel 'F' and Colonel 'B' said that late in 1942 or early in 1943, the KGB received radar technology. They claimed that this information from the Fifth was assembled in the form of photos, diagrams and written explanations by him and Blunt...The clarity and visually descriptive nature of the technical data supplied by the Fifth was a trademark of his. By comparison, Rothschild demonstrated in his book, Meditations of a Broomstick, how he took great pride in all areas of his work for MI5 in supplying exact illustrations.

The customer service guy was horrible. He asked me what I already answered and finally I just clicked off and called Comcast directly… The answer? Prices have been raised all over the board even on people who signed up under special offers??? Can they do that? Hmm well we had no yearly contract with the service, but doesn’t the special offer constitute as an agreement? I say, YES!! When I told her to cancel my acct she then tried to get me to stay based on other promotions such as lower cost airfare and hotel deals??? First of all I don’t need to pay overpriced Internet to get those deals and second which should be first I can’t trust the special offers after this??? So I am calling tomorrow and canceling…
The dark period in the building’s history was during 1957 to 1964, when it was part of the CIA’s Project MKULTRA experiments into mind control using drug-induced techniques. The Institute’s Director Donald Ewen Cameron was recruited by the CIA who conducted experiments using LSD, and various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His “driving” experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced coma for weeks at a time while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements.

There are no obvious sub-par options. Besides not having any faction clearly under or overpowered, the options between your own troops lend themselves to all kinds of playstyles. A unit one player would never field is another player’s mandatory. Just take a look at tournament rankings and lists. Every faction is in a top ten list, and if you check two same faction lists you will probably have almost zero coincidences.

We talked about options with Ethan's bowels not being the best. Option 1 was switch from Creon to Pancreaze (both pancreatic enzymes.) Option 2 was do a fecal elastase test (collect his poop for 3 days) and see if he just needs a higher dose of enzymes. Option 3 try adding sodium bicarbonate to his enzymes and see if that helps his enzymes get past his stomach and into his small intestines so they can do their job. The doc wanted to try option 1 first. I was all for shooting right to option 3, as it has a few benefits beyond lowering acid in the stomach.

Richard LaGravenese wrote a brilliant screenplay – he did Sara Gruen proud – but I guess I should have expected that from the guy who wrote the screenplays for (amongst others) The Fisher King, The Bridges of Madison County & The Horse Whisperer. This movie had me gripped with the suspense (pretty tough to do when you know what should be happening next cause you read the book!) & I loved Reece Witherspoon as Marlena (still not so fond of Pattinson, though that may be just a prejudice against him for his silly vampire movies). If you haven’t read the book, please do so & if you aren’t fond of reading (or can’t be bothered, lol), watch this movie! It was excellent!!

This rosy cheeked man and his wife just happened to take a seat directly behind him. I never heard or even noticed them arrive,I can't imagine why (haha), but just like magic there they were. And just like magic and a prayer answered he reached up and tapped Preston on his shoulder. Oh how I wish I had a video of his expression as he turned,to see who was addressing him while he was busy being fussy. This angel dressed in red said "Preston have you been good this year?" He could not find his ability to answer but his face sure showed how much he hoped so!
“I mean, I have some junk in the trunk, if that’s what you’re asking. Child-bearing hips, that’s for sure,” was my response. I really wasn’t prepared to defend my body this morning – especially after spending the past week and a half eating and drinking whatever I wanted while I was on vacation.
So I’m keeping it on a week.. it’s my vacation you see..
At first, we (my mother and I and other people not in her family) assumed that she had some sort of developmental problem so it was okay for her to act out. She has been like this since I knew her (when she was 3? and sat on my finger, leaving it crooked and butt-ugly), so I kind of assumed that she was slightly pampered and maybe it would go away after a while. I was around 10 then.
The whole gang down by the water.
Every once in a while I make a meal for the sake of eating something but not really expecting great things from it. Every once in a while those meals, simple as they may be in preparation and ingredients, surpass all the expectations I never had. This meal was one of them.
This was what I felt last Sunday when I went for my groceries. A holdup!!!! Yes you read it right. A Holdup!!!! Grocery prices did really go up. I felt like we the end users are being robbed of our basic needs. Manufacturers and sellers know that no matter what the cost be, we the end users will purchase it as they are part of our daily existence and can’t live without them. On the other hand they’re right. Maybe some items we may be able to forego but the very basic needs we definitely can’t do without. So there you go--- we are their willing victims that fall into their hands. How about the budget we have been making for the whole month to end up finding out that the budget we have, won’t be able to buy all the things that are listed down on our grocery lists and they are the same lists we had last month. I only do my grocery once a month so any increase in prices between these dates is quite a shock to me especially when your budget for this month is already done..
I want to get this out quickly folks. I’m exhausted and headed to bed. It’s just coming up on 10 PM in Moscow, but we made it here in time for festivities.

Well if your anything like me....A LOT. Our garage is my computer room, lounge room, gym and of course my craft room. I've been lucky enough to have a couple of days off work and I though I'd take this opportunity to get in and do some serious cleaning up. With 25 years of crafting under my belt, I've collected a lot of stuff (all good I tell ya, I might need it or I might go back to it). I had boxes in boxes and still more storage containers of all different shapes and sizes. I was well over due for a major organizing fit and with the amazing discovering of plastic shoe boxes that were brought in a pack of 10 and came flat packed from Bunnings (Hardware Store). So with 40 boxes made up, I was going to tackle this massive chore. I did go and buy 3 more compartment organizers and 10 more clear lunch box size boxes before I started.

When Brad and I had our Broiler chickens processed I had been very hesitant to eating one yet.These chickens became like pets to me, and would greet me every morning.

While out there I discovered that we have one flower on our giant pea plants… and of course I was thinking of just giving up on them and pulling them so I can plant the squashes. So of course we are starting to get flowers now. So I’m not sure if I should go ahead and pull them, tossing them to the chickens then; and planting my squash or give it another week?

“Col. now Gen. Devens is a native of Cambridge; graduated at Harvard college in 1838; commenced the practice of law in Greenfield, and for some years was associated with Mr. George T. Davis; afterwards, under Mr. Fillmore, he was U.S. marshal for Massachusetts, and for most of the time since has occupied a constantly growing position at the Worcester bar. He commanded a battalion of the three months volunteers, and re-enlisted for the war, with the appointment of Col. from Gov. Andrew. A brave soldier, a gallant and handsome bachelor, and a gentleman of first abilities, his promotion will be hailed with satisfaction in camp and in parlor, by his brothers of the law, and by all the people who know him.”

Its most conspicuous features, the great towers, will serve as landmarks to the adjoining cities, and they will be entitled to be ranked as national monuments. As a great work of art, and as a successful specimen of advanced bridge engineering, this structure will forever testify to the energy, enterprise and wealth of the community which shall secure its erection.”
God is not God unless He is all-powerful, all knowing, absolutely in charge. If God exists only as God because of support given from other intelligent forms, He is not God at all (Isaiah 44:6; Romans 3:4; Revelation 1:8; 21:6; 22:13).

Two things stood out to me, while I was watching The Vow.
If you’ve ever done fitness training, you’ll know that when you start, it’s a really hard slog. There were days at training when we’d finish and I was physically sick because my body had been pushed. But we had to give 110%.There were times when it was raining, and I’d train. There were times when I was tired, or sick, or not feeling like training, and still I had to turn up. There were many discouraging moments when the hard work didn’t seem to be paying off; for example, even though I had trained well, I would not perform on game day. Or I’d bomb a try that I’d scored a hundred times at training.
I had a lot of fun with these. I was working on refining this tumbler form and incorporated three different techniques for the surface decoration. I have silk screened slip transfers, ez-screen print transfers (which are essentially unmounted silkscreens with wider mesh) and sgraffito. The botanical imagery was created from my own drawings and the water tower image is from a photo that I took here in Chico of one of the downtown water towers. These are probably my favorite pieces from the concentration and I am looking forward to exploring this some more now that I am home.

The grand finale
1. Not taking the story too seriously
I'm not sure what changed my mind with these. Part of it was that I was wanting a pair of straight-legs with a more interesting wash than my Joe's jeans, and part of it was that I just really liked the cut of these. And get this: while the model looked pretty good in the photos, and I could tell there was no posterior flattening action going on, I figured these jeans would actually look better on me because my butt is rounder than hers. And I was right! Take that, twiggy!
The gorgeous papers are MME Everyday Flair and I think I'm going to need to buy more already! I've used some more of the scrim to add texture, some satin ribbon and sewn the sequins and beads. I love the clean and simple sketch for the Sugar Bowl this fortnight!
As we entered 2012 God comforted me with this verse found in Ezekiel 34:16 “I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak.” This transition in life leaves me feeling weak and my faith small. Crying at the drop of a hat and praying over big decisions, I am reminded once again it is God who is in control and I need to have greater faith and more patience. The verse in Ezekiel reminds me God is the tenderest toward those who feel weak. In The Bruised Reed, Richard Sibbes writes that “Christ values us by what we shall be.” God takes something little in our eyes and develops something of great value. What we see as a little plant becomes a mighty tree, what the world sees as a little stable, becomes the birth place of a King, and a pearl small in size becomes something of great worth. He has promised to strengthen the weak, take my small faith and lack of patience, and develop them into something of great worth. He also has promised to take the small 3lb baby I had 17 years ago and develop something of great worth in him.

I remember once we were in a foot chase and I ran one way another officer runs another. The next thing I hear is Taser deployed. I run to that officer’s location and I see the officer standing and the suspect on the ground. The officer had one hand with the taser and the other with a cigarette. He was like he is not going anywhere! I was like yeah that is obvious but have you checked him for weapons or a gun. Dumb ass.

The point I am making is this...the book worked for ME! I loved it! I get up every morning and I thank God for placing this book in my hands and for helping me to see what HE sees in me. I thank Him for giving the author the words to convey HIS message. Is every woman in this world insecure? NO! Praise God for that! I was. I am not now! My prayer, after having read this particular book was "Lord, if there is another woman that feels the way I have for their entire lives...place this book in their hands and let them lose themselves in scripture the way that I have. Let them see what YOU see in them."

We the People of America ARE the militia. Those that call us terrorists do so out of their own fear and at their own peril. Why? Because THEY are the illegitimate ones.

This is the treat with no name, borne of a spontaneous amalgam of hazelnut chocolate spread, sweetened condensed milk, biscuit bits, nuts and rum.

Through his study of the treatment of the mentally ill Foucault highlighted the fact that in this new version of the mechanistic body, (mind/soul no longer connected to the body) that disease and illness were beginning to be defined in medicalized ways that removed past religious connotations and social controls from diseases such as leprosy and epilepsy by placing them firmly in the hands of the medical profession (Cregan, 2006:46, Lupton, 2003:6, Turner, 1996: 63).

Said the judges: "Its simplicity was its elegance." As the victor, Mr. Huebbe will get to return to the grill for the New York Food and Wine Festival in DUMBO this fall. Well done, sir, well done indeed.

This procedure takes about an hour, all told. You are completely empty; not having eaten anything for 24 hours will do that to a person. Thanks to modern medical science and a small compressor you now also contain the cubic air mass of a military weather balloon. Combine these factors with the unmistakable aroma of vaporized ass growths and you are now primed to cut the fart of a lifetime. As soon as you wake up and turn over EVERYONE in the office will know what kind of a procedure you just had. And everyone in the parking lot. And passengers on commercial flights. And scientists aboard the international space station. It is both awe-inspiring and humbling.

Though it was a nice experience but that was not my kids' type of pancake that they will fancy having it again.

No wonder words failed in some of the commentary. But even when faced with lesser challenges, the broadcasters did no better than the vox pops - fantastic, stunning, brilliant, beautiful - they all said the same until I thought I would scream if I heard "down-to-earth" again.

The cost of one stamps is 45 cents and your wedding invitation will probably cost at least 60 cents with so many inserts adding to the weight. To place vintage stamps -- assuming their denominations are all between 1-30 cents -- you will need a huge envelope to get to the total you need to mail one invite. And remember that an oversized envelope will also add to the price of mailing.

This is like the ‘Islamic science’ case. During the early Middle Ages there were indeed many great scientists in Islamic countries. But that was all in spite - not because - of Islam or the Koran. They were scientists who just happened to be Muslims as well, just as in our example of nice and moderate Muslims that they are moderate or nice Muslims in spite of Islam, not because of it. Their niceness or intrinsic moderation tells us about them as individuals, and little or nothing about Islam or the Koran itself.
In the New Testament it is no different. In 1 Corinthians Paul wrote that we are His Temple, a fragrant offering. In Hebrews we are to offer the sacrifice of praise. In Romans 12 we are to offer ourselves as living sacrifices. Jesus said that the life of the disciple is to be one of self-denial, taking up a cross, and following him. Peter said we are to follow closely in the footsteps of Jesus.

Speaking or praying in tongues is one of the more controversial gifts of the Holy Spirit (as per, 1Cor. 12 ff) because many see praying in a language you don’t understand as a demeaning of our persons – especially our intellect. After all how can it be prayer at all if you don’t know what you are saying? How can spouting what appears to be a bunch of gibberish be called prayer? This mystery can only be understood if we properly understand that man has been endowed with a capability to transcend the natural – that capability is embedded in what scripture calls the “spirit” of man.

The most alluring and mysterious part of the human body for me is the brain. I'm fascinated by it. Not in a scientific way, although I do do my fair share of reading from a layperson's point of view. I'm more attracted to the idea that we still don't know how capable and developed our brains are and it's very unlikely we ever will.

Instead of asking a question if now is a good time or talking about racism from a perspective that only adds ambiguity and confusion to the issue in order to spare somebody’s feelings, why can’t we have an honest discussion about America’s racial disparity. How is it possible that even in twenty first century America an unarmed black teenager can be murdered by a man who, if rumors of his compulsion to call the police at the site of an unknown black person holds true, obviously has a problem with black people and can walk away from the scene of his crime with the murder weapon? How does that not bring to mind the history of pre civil rights era of a place like Mississippi or Alabama when racism was so rampant? Why don’t we talk about the fact that something like half of the white population were tired of hearing about the Trayvon case just weeks after the boy was shot and Zimmerman remained free while more than eighty percent of the black community felt otherwise?

"You know," the seller suddenly spoke up, "I'm sure this is a rare typewriter and it can fetch some money. But I don't know enough to fix it, and perhaps you could? Even if it turns out to be seriously damaged, you could still keep it as a decorative object. And if you fixed it, you could sell it and make a nice profit! Actually, someone offered me thirty francs for it this morning and I refused. But you... you can have it for ten."
We went to the middle school field, where I walked the dog around the dark, bushy perimeter, and he set up the tripod in the clear center of the grass, which was this night lit silver by the moon. Too bright for good stars. Still, he decided to try all different exposures, and maybe get some pictures of the moon, and maybe the lights of houses on the surrounding streets, which looked glittery as stars through the shifting black branches of trees in the wind.

Journalism was never enough to communicate the essence of this world and so, a few years ago, I turned to short fiction which has demanded of me new levels of commitment; it is much slower, more difficult and satisfying than journalism, and requires a search for truth that is not always important for newspaper or magazine writing. Producing records and concerts requires the same search for perfection; the refusal to accept the fast track, but rather to look deeper and more slowly at people and to reflect their personality only when you understand, or think you understand, where they are coming from.

While the ladies (there was not one brave male in sight) were strewn about the room in various stretching positions waiting for class to begin, in walked an incredibly handsome man. He was tall, slender, tan, and quite fit. He reminded me of a young Sean Connery in his early Bond days. And like some of the early Bond beach scenes, he was wearing shorter shorts than I had ever seen on a man not competing in an Olympic sprinting event. Bright orange shorty-shorts and a tank top revealing his well shaped arms, he enthusiastically rallied us into three lines and began leading us in stretches. I will admit I didn’t understand half of what he was saying. I was grinning ear to ear, however, completely motivated.

This is the paradigmatic south Indian dish, made from lentil and rice flour formed into a batter, poured into a great thin circle like a pancake, and quickly cooked on a big griddle.

Wednesday morning I arrived and did Colton’s feed. He finished the entire thing in 20-25 minutes no problem. That’s my boy! So, they were comfortable saying he could do full feeds by mouth as long as he did it within 20-25 minutes. Colton was happy about that! Both babies were scheduled to have surgical consult at SSH before they left for their hernias, so they did this at BCH and with Keltie they were concerned about the “hardness” of her “hernia”. So, they schedule an u/s on her hernia to get a better look at it. Come to find out…her left ovary had made its way into her inguinal canal and that’s what they were feeling! The surgery team came up to speak with me and explained that due to the nature of the organ being in the canal, they had to do surgery within 24-48 hours. I was petrified. They were able to push the ovary back up (with Keltie screaming – the poor thing!) so they were okay waiting until Thursday to do the surgery. That started a flurry of activity and me meeting with the anesthesiologist, surgeon team, etc…. I couldn’t believe my little 5lb miracle was going to have to be put under for surgery and I was so afraid that it was going to impact her progress with her breathing and being off of any breathing support. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep much that night.

I haven’t enjoyed very much of what I read in The Great Omission. That’s not to say it’s a bad book. It has it’s moments. But something he has said twice so far has intrigued me, “To drive the point home I often put this challenge: I do not know of a denomination or local church in existence that has as it’s goal to teach its people to do everything Jesus said. I’m not talking about a whim or a wish, but a plan. I ask you sincerely, is this on your agenda? To teach disciples surrounded in the triune reality to do everything Jesus said?” ( Dallas Willard, The Great Omission, 61, cf. page 73). I think that most preachers are afraid of teaching obedience because they are absolutely terrified that they might actually be teaching some sort of ‘works righteousness.’ But I think on this point I am in agreement with Willard, and he has said this several times already in the book that ‘grace is no opposed to effort, it is opposed to earning’ (61, and elsewhere).
But anyway this now connects the dots, as it seems that the ghost of her unborn little brother is now haunting her. Well…that’s a pretty horrible and stupid plot – kind of like something you’d see on Are You Afraid of the Dark. Or rather, the outtakes of Are You Afraid of the Dark, not even good enough to make it onto that show. So I guess it fits with the theme of everything else in the movie being horrible and stupid just fine.
Before dating and marrying Joel I was not heavily into sports. In college, I went to football games to socialize and to do stadium cleanup and then maybe topped it off by going to a few other random sports events along the way. In high school I was a cheerleader and spectator for all of the sports my brothers played.
You read that title and wonder how budgeting or bills could ever be bliss? Maybe not ever. But by putting an effective action into place, that totally rocks, is a GIANT step in the right direction! It can be all the difference in getting bills paid on time, knowing what's coming and going and maintaining a successful budget!
It’s fair to say that this beer split the crowd and, to be fair, that is not a situation peculiar to Myrniong. The match with the dessert was close to perfect for me and it seems by the licked clean plates that I was not the only one in that boat.

The more appropriate line of inquiry would be to ask why the chain of command didn’t use the power they had to ensure that Gottlieb, et al., conducted a thorough investigation, instead of leaving the holes outlined above.
The above is two collections of rocks. The first collection includes agates and crystals and quartz. The larger collection includes round beach rocks and grape vines.
Literally. I got back from Utah two weeks ago and have been sick ever since. The day after we got home, I was hit with a bad head cold. Then came the bladder infection. And now I'm fighting a severe sinus infection on both sides and an ear infection. Hoping the heavy-duty antibiotics I started last night will kick in at any second. All this after months and months of great health. I had the best winter I've had in years, with only one very minor cold. I've been taking care of myself and my emotional health and it's been paying off.
I’m very much open for pain medication if I’m not handling it very well but I would much prefer a medicated free birth.

And the concept of “dating” as a vehicle to see if this is the “right” person… Just about everyone I know says you just know when it’s the right person. I know that was my experience, too – before I even knew if he was available. I assumed he wasn’t, but I still knew. And if God created Eve for Adam, then it makes sense to me that we really are created for one person, and we’ll know when we meet that person. I’m not a fan of the whole “soulmate” concept, but I do think there is a hint of truth to it.
The midlevel murderers (field operations) of JFK would include CIA guys like Richard Helms, James Angleton, E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, David Morales, William King Harvey and David Atlee Phillips. Deputy Harry Weatherford is a good candidate to have been on the Records Building as a sniper. Influential mobster Johnny Roselli was especially close friends with the CIA’s William King Harvey, a rabid Kennedy hater. The most likely mafia godfathers involved would be Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante, particularly in the Jack Ruby murder of Oswald and perhaps in the JFK Assassination as well and other murders in the post assassination cover up.

Sandee is more forthright. He told the US congress that numerous references were made to World Cup attacks in closed-frequency radio broadcasts and telephone intercepts this month in Mauritania, Algeria, Mali, Pakistan and Yemen. Information confirms that several venues will be targeted, some simultaneously, others at random. Reference is also made to the possibility of a kamikaze-type attack."

When people think of Italian cooking, most think about pasta and pizza pies. However, there ar so many more dishes and influences that inspire those dishes. The history of the Italian people, as well as Italy’s geographic location, both contribute to the types of food. Italian culture is shown through its cuisine.

So that's the plan. I'm also trying to be really good about strength and cross-training during the week and so far, so good. This week's training is very similar to last week's except I'm running 5 miles as my week day runs instead of 4. Here's what it looks like.
I'm tired of medicine being the bad guy. We should all be grateful. The death rate has gone down for a reason. I firmly believe that God led man to discover modern medicine. That being said, I think people also need to allow their bodies to do what they do more often than trying to control their bodies. Ie: elective inductions for convenience. Inductions for health reasons do not apply, but inducing at 38 weeks is just unnecessary. The chance of having a c-section after elective induction is higher than after spontaneous labor.

So here we are. Three or four weeks of antibiotics, and we hope for the best. Everything I've read about Lyme disease suggests that it can be hard to treat, and even harder to know for sure when it's gone, because some of the symptoms can linger on long after the disease is cured. But at least we know what it is now - it's very unnerving when your child has unexplainable symptoms and nobody can figure out what's wrong with her. At least now we know what we're dealing with and we can do something about it. Of course we've also read lots of horror stories about the possible complications, which can be scary if you let it, but we're trying to keep our heads on straight about that. We'll just keep telling ourselves that the serious complications are rare.
There isn’t much of this going on in today’s world! There is a lot of fixin’ our thoughts on things that are none of these. You hear parents yelling at their kids for foul language, when the kids get it from their parents; you see people at work trying to get by with whatever they can, instead of working to the fullest of their ability; society is full of pornography – not only the hard stuff that wrecks marriages and families, but soft porn, watched on tv, seen at the movies, displayed on magazine pages until we become immunized to its effects; fidelity in relationships or marriages is thrown out the window – after all, if it’s kept hidden, it’s ok, right?; violence in video games, movies, loss of life taken lightly – we are honoring the horrors that our military face on a regular basis – things that mess with their heads for the rest of their lives; bodies are thrown from one lover to the other for instant gratification; babies are ripped from their mother’s womb, deemed an inconvenience from a sexual act that most likely should not have taken place anyhow; deceit is prevalent all around as times are hard and people fear for their survival, yet refuse to let God handle it all; lying is used to get us out of anything we don’t want to deal with; rage runs rampant from the highways to our homes. The list goes on and on….
This is my Camellia bush! Aren’t those flowers just gorgeous? Oh, yeah….did I say I love flowers? LOL it is hard to make a card without flowers and hard to be around my house and not see them.

This one is a metallic pink in color. You can feel the mica/glitter but that’s okay (well it’s okay if you don’t mind).

Ishmael goes on to study at the University of Tehran but subsequently dropout to pursue full time work as a professional leftwing revolutionary. His party agitates against the Shah, organize a clandestine movement, and wage a guerrilla war with the Cuban Revolution as their model. Of course, they were eventually outmaneuvered by the Imams. But more than the standard academic postcolonial valorization of exile, My Father’s Notebook gives us a glimpse into the lost promise held by the possibility of a genuine revolution in Iran.
When I asked the guys what music inspires them, they informed me that “Bobby is heavily influenced by Nirvana and Abner Jay, Leo is really into Titus Andronicus and Manchester Orchestra right now, Zach is jockin’ GDP, Nasty Nas and Lagwagon and Bill is into Discordance Axis, Pig Destroyer and Regina Spektor.

Christina: If there is a secret to doing it all well, then I'm not quite sure I've found it yet. For me, it's best to create for Midnight Snack right when the ideas pop into my head.

“Gastro, is one of those funny words,” Sarah and I discussed this at length, “Too often it gives places the excuse to add £5 to the menu and serve sub standard food,or it tries to turn pubs into formal restaurants. Our one simple mission is to serve great, affordable pub food in a friendly environment. Luckily, we’ve landed on our feet with the brilliant Matt Perry as our chef. He aims to create simple yet appealing food, making everything from baking bread to homemade ice creams. Even with using the best local ingredients that are fresh and seasonal, we were determined that every dish on the menu would still cost less than £10.”
Hayley leant her head back on the sofa and sighed outwardly. All she wanted was some recognition for who she really was. Except, of course, that wasn’t all she wanted. What she desired most of all was to have her daughter back in her arms; her daughter belonged just as Laura had insinuated – with her parents, her real parents.
The specific gravity finally dropped below .01 and I made the first re-rack of the pinot. There was a 2 inch layer of sediment on the bottom and probably a half gallon of left over wine from moving from an 8 gallon to a 6 gallon carboy.

Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Saute chopped onion for about 5 minutes, until softened. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring. Add chipotle, cumin, oregano, tomatoes, and stock. Simmer for 10 minutes. **At this point, the cookbook tells you to puree the whole thing, but I didn't like it super smooth. The next time I made it, I coarsely pureed about half of the soup and preferred the chunkier texture.** Return soup to a simmer, add chopped chicken and bell peppers, and simmer until chicken is tender and peppers are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add lime juice. Correct flavor with lime juice and salt as necessary. Serve with toppings! Serves 6.

And in the last few minutes of the game, Finland rallied hard and was able to score 5-3, winning the game! Still, it's the best finish for Slovakia, fourth this Olympics. I admire their moxie for going all out and rattling the best teams out there! The Finns also get kudos for a spectacular comeback after a rough experience this Olympics.

Hold each moment of your life tenderly in your hands. Stroke it, cradle it, sing it, live it, feel the joy and the sorrow and the person that you have become, that you will become by this collection of ephemeral fleeting miracles in your life. Wear them like a cloak around your shoulders, a reminder that life is a gift in all it's colors and textures. The moment is now. Don't waste it. It will be gone too soon...
And here’s the kicker, the thing about sex for me: The intensity of my sexual receptivity is directly proportional to my perception of a man’s overall acceptability as a life mate. Not as an object of desire. Not as a playmate. Not as a boyfriend. I’m wired to desire long-term, growing-old-together kind of mating and that’s even when I consciously think “I don’t want a relationship.”

Another whole month gone by with nary a word on this blog. That's the bad news. The good news is that I have TONS to write about, I just drop into bed exhausted every night without having shared a single little bit with you.
Literary fiction: The focus is on character arc, themes (often existential), and the use of language. I like to compare literary fiction authors to runway designers. The general public isn't mean to wear the clothes models display on the runway. They exist to impress the other designers and show the fashion industry what they can do. Literary writing is a lot like that, but on a more accessible level. Many dismiss literary fiction as "too artsy" and "books without a plot," but this isn't true. At least not most of the time. The plot is there; it's just incidental. Literary fiction is meant to make the reader reflect, and the author will almost always prefer a clever turn of phrase over plot development.
