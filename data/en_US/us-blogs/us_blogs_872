Sometimes we may not be seeing the results we expect from our prayer because God has a purpose for the thing we pray about that we do not fully understand. But it may be, and perhaps more often is, that we diminish our role in the whole thing. We are always looking for Elijah’s lightning bolt fire, when maybe God asks us to be the spark for the fire. Tabitha made clothes for widows, she literally clothed the naked and brought life to her community in a manner that 1,000 prayer meetings alone could never do. Maybe we’re too busy ‘naming and claiming’ stuff that we forget that God named us and instructed us to bring about his kingdom through our actions. Just as a miracle without the gospel is dead, so is faith without action. We have castrated our religion; we only want the big-show fix and forget about serving Jesus in every action. By emphasizing prosperity (and I’m not just talking financial) we have robbed the gospel of the truth that God always loves, always blesses, always perseveres in good times and in bad.
Budgets were twisted, obfuscated and selectively quoted, departmental spending figures were deliberately witheld, all for political advantage. These figures now 'belong' to Cameron (and his mate, Gideon) and they can see the damage in black and white.
A critique levied by RPM party boss Boubacar Touré, among others, is that the new cabinet shows too much influence from neighboring heads of state, particularly Blaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso. The most senior cabinet member, Sadio Lamine Sow, placed in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has served as a special adviser to Compaoré in Ouagadougou for several years. The new Minister of Communications and Information Technology is Hamadoun Touré, who as spokesman for the United Nations mission in Côte d’Ivoire last year was seen as someone close to Ivoirian President Alassane Dramane Ouattara. Notably, the cabinet includes several “Maliens de l’exterieur” — like the prime minister himself, these are migrants who’ve spent much of their professional lives abroad.
She tells me over and over again, that she’s homesick. But something which she said to the visiting nurse, pained me. I had never heard her say this before. When the nurse asked her a question, she came out with her usual, “Well, I’m not from here. I’m from Wisconsin. I love Wisconsin. That’s where I want to die. She quickly corrected herself, when she said, “Well, I want to live there too.”

Earlier this week The ODI asked you to send in some questions and there are so many great questions! There is of course no way to answer each one but in this bonus podcast we answer several of the common questions that were sent in and provide you with our initial thoughts about the finale.
For example, a person involved in a low-level crime, such as underage smoking, drinking or loitering, may not realize that the crime isn't serious enough for them to be hauled off to jail. Instead of standing their ground and accepting a lecture from the law, they may try to run or even worse, may react violently.

It is hard not knowing where you come from, or who you look like, or whether you share the same personality traits as a family member, or what happened in your birth mother’s life to drive her to make such a difficult decision. It is frustrating. There was always someone talking about family history, family trees, ancestry, heritage, family resemblances and similar. It is hard not knowing whether your birth mother or biological father is dead or alive. These are all thoughts that fill your head. Endless thoughts…. Endless questions. And at that point, I was never sure I would ever find out the answers or know the truth about any of it.

I love seeing her interact with my children. The way she rocks Connor and sings him to sleep. How she can captivate Aidan while reading him a book. And the joy in Aidan's face when she gets down on the floor to play with his zoo, cars or boat with him.
Article 2 The term “places of origin of agricultural products” refers to the relevant regions, in which the plants, animals and microbes as well as their products are produced.
When we arrived early on Saturday morning, there were already several older kids jumping into the quarry and empty beer cans scattered about. They were jumping off of two large, flat rocks that jutted out at different heights over the deep, clear, green water. When stone is quarried, the cutters make straight cuts at right angles, creating clean drops often as high as a hundred feet in some quarries, depending on the amount of accumulated rainwater. The bottom of a quarry is solid stone. Rain and surface runoff flow into the pit, creating a reservoir of clean but greenish rainwater. It is strikingly beautiful in a strange way because it has a green glow in the sun and a mirror-like surface reflecting the shear stone rock faces.
Once again, it pitted mothers against mothers, waging another battle in the Mommy Wars about who is a better parent. It is from these Mommy Wars that lead women to feel so much guilt about simply not feeling as good as another mom because her parenting choices are different.
I was wary of the black clouds south of us, so I did not want the boys to do their usual walk to the coop. I estimated we had 15 or 20 minutes until the storm arrived. Curtis agreed to drive them and, as we hoped, the hens had roosted early. The door was closed and the boys sprinted back to the pickup in the rain. By the time they drove back to the house, large branches were coming off cottonwood trees and floating through the air. My 15-20 minute estimate was seriously wrong…I later learned the storm front was moving at over 60 miles per hour.
When Maclaren-Ross’ isn’t regaling the reader with accounts of meeting the famous (“I glanced around and as I did so Graham Greene himself appeared quite silently in the open doorway. I was startled because not even a creak on the stair had announced his approach. Seeing me there gave him also a start, and he took a step back. He was wearing a brown suit and large horn-rimmed spectacles, which he at once snatched off as if they had been his hat.”) or expounding about his rambunctious nightly adventures, he writes quiet – and beautiful – stream-of consciousness prose. It feels like the reportage of an observing spectre. Here he is in the End of a Perfect Day, sitting sedately in the reading room at the Plaza Mickey Rooney, watching the world around him: “I settle down to write, someone plays the same tune over and over again on a piano in the games room. Men step over your feet with plates of cakes and cups of tea slopping into the saucer. One trips and drops the lot. Shattered china and a steaming brown puddle on the floor. An incredibly old man with a purple nose peddles newspapers: Anyone like the latest? A lance corporal asks me for a light; some men start singing to the piano; a girl of about 16, daughter of one of the servers, sits down in the next armchair and talks. I kissed her once under the mistletoe at Christmas and she’s never got over it. It’s impossible to work here, I decide to go back and type out what I’ve written.” And what this Bloomsbury flaneur and colossus of freelance literature has written is a spectacular body of work.
That was after we'd gone to Dangar's Falls, where, I discovered only long after the event, Tracey was a life-time sufferer of vertigo.

** That’s the way he said it, and I like the way it sounds. The doubling up of “show” is interesting. What he is saying is that he participates in a lot of shows, but the amount of work he shows in those exhibitions is sparse. This for him was based in Minimalist aesthetics/politics. It also, for me, fits into the aspect of his practice of “not being there,” but in a way that absence is present. Much like leaving empty “breathing spaces.” That is a sound installation tactic everyone thinking about putting art out in a space to be looked at should take to heart.

The founder of the state of the “Republic of Macedonia”, as was vested constitutionally the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (fYROM), the name with which it became a member of the UN, he served two ties as its President, a position from which he handled with great skill the wheel of the battered ship in the turbulent west Balkans of the ‘90ies.
How much worse is it when an ‘eminent ‘ ‘impartial’ judge publishes a damning judgment against an entire country, the State of Israel, full of lies, false accusations and fabrications. Judge Goldstone’s report which accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity, caused hatred against the country , destroyed its name and the reputation of its army, one of the most humane armies ever to reluctantly take up arms.

While working in Las Vegas, Cassandra met Elvis Presley who convinced her that she should go to Europe to pursue a career as a singer and actress. She did just that, landing a small part in a Federico Fellini film called Roma. She also toured Europe as lead singer of an Italian rock band called I Latins 80, incorrectly called I Latins Ochanats on many online reference sites. Good luck trying to research the band using that name! For you die-easy Elvira fans (sorry for my lame attempt at Elvira humor), here's a sample from that group's 1972 album, which was called Foglie Gialle All'imbrunire, or Yellow Leaves at Dark in English.

Thumper: It is not fear that stops me, it is the presence of the predator. There is a difference. It is important for me to stop long enough to recognize what is threatening and then to move on once I know what it is and the threat is gone. You need to look at what scares you. You have to be still to do this. If you are running you will not know what you are truly running from. And then you need to go back to enjoying the splendor of all things beautiful that surround you.

The final side uses a Protractor stamp from Jenni Bowlin which I also thought was perfect to tie in with the teacher theme. I don't remember where the banner diecut came from but I used dimensions to apply them to the block then added two Baker's Twine bows on the end. Then to fill in some gaps I used more of the daisy stamps from Renew, some gems plus a tiara sticker.

Although the sidewalk was destroyed and possible damage caused to the Underwood Playground located near this site, as well as two residences that lost power, fortunately, no injuries were recorded. The lack of communication from Con Edison with elected officials and residents about the explosion is unacceptable (aside from residents whose homes had to be searched because of the blast, and the 23 people temporarily evacuated that night). Also, improved coordination with Con Edison and the Department of Sanitation should be made a top priority as this holiday season begins.
Comment: Dr. McGuire admitted that I submitted my paper, but did not seem willing to acknowledge the legitimacy of anything I might say of an intellectual nature. Far from giving the student an encouraging response on salient topics, she contined to seem oriented toward putting me in my place — reminding me that I had to submit to her orders regarding a meeting, the IRB, and so forth. I would think that surely, by this point, a good instructor would be sensitive to the student’s potential loss of face — that his responses thus far would provide a clue that he might feel backed into a corner, in terms of grades and basic self-respect.

At this point, Guy Maddin might be one of the most mythologized figures in contemporary cinema. In each of his films he is everywhere and nowhere all at once. Nearly all of his more recent films feature a Guy Maddin, often played by Darcy Fehr. I haven’t seen Cowards in a while, but I do think that there are some common links between all of these Guys – they’re typically observers, spies, voyeurs, and despite all they’ve seen, they retain some sense of childish innocence and naïveté. And, unfortunately, few of these Guys end up where they’d most like to be. Maddin is in his early 50s now, but his fictional Guys remain pretty much the same age. I’m curious to see whether or not Maddin will continue mining this particular period of time, or if he will eventually shift to an older, more experienced Guy.

Most importantly, is that in both works this approach to character allows for a freedom in dialogue that would not exist if they were restricted to the codes of verisimilitude. In Hamlet, the two friends are insignificant, of little depth, notice, or introspection. Stoppard’s play has them speaking in long passages about free will, death, and all matter of subjects in great detail. We have a vague sense of Rosencrantz distinct from Guildenstern, with the latter smarter and more knowledgeable, yet they are in other ways indistinguishable in terms of traits, with the two often getting themselves mixed up as to who is who. Similarly, the distinctions between the two killers are almost insignificant. One is racial, the other is that Jules is smarter than Vincent. Vincent has a drug problem, but for all we know, so does Jules. That both sets of characters remain unmoored from reality allows them to speak about anything. The dialogue of the killers has already been mentioned. Here would be an example of one of Guildenstern’s many erudite speeches:
When you tell someone you hate them and that they’re gay when you KNOW they are NOT. If you give that person a GOOD and LOGICAL explanation or reason WHY you think that, it’s sharing your opinion. Why do you hate them and think they’re gay? Did they do something unforgivable and do they dress, act, talk, etc. Like they are gay? Can you even answer those questions? I bet if you’re calling someone any of those things, you can’t answer them, huh?

The Gallup poll also indicates that more stay-at-home moms tend to have a lower over-all education level in addition to a lower over-all economic level. This is definitely NOT to say that stay-at-home moms are incapable of either. However, I firmly believe that it’s a compound problem: Some moms start with a lower level of education (no degree), meaning that they are not able to find high-paying work outside the home. Because they can’t find high-paying work, they are not afforded the realistic choice to work outside the home, since the cost of child care is roughly equal to or higher than the income that she could gain at her level.

It’s disheartening to any up-and-coming playwright to see how much of the legitimate American theatre operates on a “pay-to-play” model. But there are bright spots to report. The Dramatists Guild of America has recently enacted a policy that it will not publicize any production opportunities or playwriting contests that require submission fees. Many playwriting newsletters (such as The Loop for Playwrights) have adopted similar policies. And I’m pleased to report that despite the fact I don’t submit plays to any producing organizations that require submission fees (even the prestigious ones, like the O’Neill), I still manage to get my work produced--a lot (for example, I recently had several plays produced by the nonprofit Love Creek Productions in NYC, a theatre where I knew no one prior to submitting, have never paid a submission fee, and have never been asked to donate or help fundraise a dime). I also no longer support playwrights’ organizations like Chicago Dramatists that have gone heavily over to the “pay-to-play” model, and that hasn’t hurt my playwriting career, either (though I’m sure they’d rather I didn’t say that in public).

Although I've never seen this popular children's show, my understanding about the episode in question is that Buster goes to Vermont to learn how maple sugar is made from some kids who happen to have two moms. The moms say hello, welcome Buster into their home and that's about it. Perhaps that's what Spellings is so upset about - the idea that families headed by two lesbians might not really be that different after all.

Last year Dunn had perhaps the worst year of his career and made it look like the White Sox made a mistake in signing the slugger. He recorded all career lows in every major offensive category; Batted .159, hit 11 homeruns, 42 RBIs, striking out 177 times in 122 games played. His OPS was a career low .569 (career .902 OPS), OBP was just a meager .292. Through 27 games this season Dunn is batting .250 with 8 HRs and 22 RBIs including a key 9th inning 2-run blast against the White Sox on Saturday.
So how have I managed this . . . I remove the moss that sits atop the soil under the two African Violets and soak it for at least 10 minutes. I then drizzle a very tiny bit of water (carefully avoiding the leaves) on the soil, and replace the moss back where it was. I also place the plant near a window but not directly in front of it and rotate it ever week to ensure all sides of it are receiving a bit of Mother Nature.
Option: further grate the mixture in the bowl of your food processor with the blend attachment to get a smoother texture to the mixture of grated potatoes and onion.

The day began early and my eldest son kept me company. Because of the huge retrenchement on art (although it doesn't hurt me personally, i don't have any allowance whatsoever) I thought it would be fun to stretch a clothesline with my little drawings hanging on it. Support your local artist, was a sign also hanging on the clothesline. I had some nice linen on the table with my larger drawings, some paintings and greetingcards, businesscards and free commercial greetingcards. Perhaps i was a bit too enthousiastic, because at the end i heard that my table was a bit too full and the clothesline wasn't appreciated for being disorganized. I agree with the table, a bit too much for sure LOL, but i chuckled about the clothesline. Hmmm some artists are taken themselves very, very serious without any humour. Don't get me wrong, i take myself also serious as an artist, very much so, but it's good to laugh about yourself also i think. There are too many swollen headed people on this planet.

The kind of love that makes a person stay up all night to drive out to a hurting friend. The kind of love when someone lives on hospital food and sleeps on a waiting room chair just to spend as much time as possible comforting a loved one in the hospital. The kind of love that causes a parent to get up in the night with a scared or sick child. The kind of love that causes a pastor to pray for someone. The kind of love that a teacher shows when she will not let a student fail. The kind of love that is mittens to a homeless child and food to the orphans belly. The kind of love that causes strangers to share and pray for each other’s hurts in the blog world. The kind of love that is in a baby’s laughter and complete trust in his caregiver. The kind of love that is in answered and unanswered prayers.

"Rest assured," he said, "in the event of another public emergency our response and coverage will be more robust and in line with the gravity of the situation." In the near future he plans to meet with elected officials and fire and police officials to hash out an emergency protocol that would give local governments the ability to get emergency information on the air right away.

For those of you who are following our harrowing adventures in Homeschooling on Facebook, this is pretty old news. But – we decided to give Homeschool a try over the summer, and then enroll Auston in a VPK (free for all 4 year olds in our state) for the school year and supplement with Homeschool. Ultimately, we’d like to give Auston the chance to try both types of learning and see which he excels at and prefers.

The last chapter in the book was interesting to me from a different perspective. It talks about pain management in the elderly, especially those with dementia. My mother is a geriatric nurse and I used to work at a nursing home. Here I also got some of my previous knowledge confirmed, I also learned some new things. My mum encouraged me to touch my residents. She has always pointed out the importance of human contact in caring for others. This book also emphasizes this. This is something I’ve taken with me to my teaching career. I know that there has been a lot written about how you have to be careful when touching a student, but I firmly believe that patting someone on the shoulder, or hugging a girl who is devastated because her boyfriend has broken up with her, is something that we SHOULD do. So there. Anyway back to the pain management of the elderly. The book points out that many of those who suffer from dementia might also be in pain and that this pain manifests itself as increased “dementia behavior”. The patient appears restless and disturbing, but it might actually be pain, or lack of stimulation. To me this is fascinating because I have listened to my mom preach this for years. She is a strong believer in less medication is better and that stimulation is necessary.

All swirling galaxies operate according to this new law. We don’t see “funnels” in space because, just as in the case of tornadoes, the funnel cloud doesn’t usually touch down. Most galaxies that are swirling appear like dark funnel clouds that begin to form but never touch down. Further, we are observing a process that would in many cases take perhaps thousands or millions of years, as compared to the seconds it takes a tornado to strike.

You’ll notice that things are a little out of order this morning; that is, the sermon has been moved forward and is seated before the singing of the chief hymn. Well, it’s quite suitable for the First Sunday in Advent. This is a season for preparing for and receiving things that are out of sorts. The unlimited divine is found within the limitations of created status. A virgin has a baby without knowing a man. Angels deliver the message of birth, not to royalty, but to filthy shepherds as the first pastors for the manger king. The innocent One pays for the guilty. And there’s so much more. The chief hymn for this morning, attributed to the fourth century Ambrose (with the later help and padding of Martin Luther), it walks us through the entirety of the Christian story with simple, eloquent style. So let’s view the portrait and THEN let’s sing it.

A healthy nail has a specific shape—slightly raised in the middle, then curving down a bit at the tip. So when you see a nail with the exact opposite configuration, that should be a clue that all is not right. “It’s called a spoon-shaped nail, and it’s a symptom of iron deficiency anemia,” says Dr. D’Anne Kleinsmith, a spokesperson for the American Dermatological Society. As with many health problems, it can take months of iron deficiency before the problem shows up in the nails. And when the anemia is corrected, it will take awhile for normal-shaped nails to re-grow.

Here’s one thing the numbers make very clear- Republicans dodged a bullet when Sharron Angle was kept out of the race. Only 24% of voters in the district have a favorable opinion of her to 63% with a negative one and in a hypothetical head to head with Marshall she would trail 47-40. The fact that Amodei polls 20 points better than Angle really makes you wonder what would have happened to Harry Reid with a serviceable opponent.

First things first though. Who was Pey Berland? Pey (Pierre, or Peter, in Gascon) was born in 1375 to a father who was a labourer from Avensan and a mother who was a peasant from Moulis. In spite of these humble roots, he was educated by a local notary before being sent to a clerical school in Bordeaux after the death of his father, then to university in Toulouse. Returning to Bordeaux, he became a priest in Bouliac to the south-east of the city around 1412. He went on to become secretary to the Archbishop of Bordeaux, travelling around France, Italy and England in this capacity, before Pope Martin V appointed him Archbishop of Bordeaux on August 13th 1430.

Another species currently getting a lot of attention from humans are dolphins. An international panel of scientists has announced that these slippery sea-mammals should be classified as non-human persons. While I’m all in favour of giving them greater legal protection, I worry that uplifting their status might give them ideas. Dolphins are insatiable sex maniacs, and no tourist beach would be safe if they acquired a taste for human tail.

I’ve actually been there, but only for about 8 hours, most of which were spent in the airport. Being in the coffee industry, this city is Mecca (one of two Meccas anyway). I need to actually spend some time there bouncing from coffee house to coffee house and mingling with the locals. It seems like a city that is somehow more progressive than the one I currently live in, and that idea is intriguing.

That's my take. However, I'm looking at the whole situation from a basketball sense. Money wise, he would bring in a few bucks for a number of years. Despite the Cavalier's inability to put a decent team around LeBron, Cleveland was rocking downtown on game nights.

The actual ownership structure though is a touch more complex. The grounds originally belonged to the local Teycheney family who, come 1920, no longer wanted the racecourse on their land. In response, local dignitary the Marquis du Vivier founded the Société Anonyme de l’Hippodrome du Bouscat (a limited company) and, after joining forces with some like-minded friends, purchased the property, which was subsequently leased back to the Société d’Encouragement de Bordeaux. Finally, in 2000, the local town council acquired the grounds for a token euro, and the new owners invested heavily in the infrastructure of the racecourse (from the changing and weighing facilities for the jockeys to a revamped “panoramic”

But while week one comes with a resenting knowledge that similar must be endured again next week, week two comes with, yes, more to deal with shitness-wise, but also a hope that week three – our well-won week off chemo – will be better, bringing with it blissful freedoms in which we can actually do stuff and go places and do work and eat out and see people and get dressed and wear make up (not that eyeliner is an especially good look on P).

Aarhusians I Am Bones are one of the seminal bands of their generation. Many of Denmark’s new favourite bands cite I Am Bones’ unique brand of quirky lo-fi rock as a major influence. Musically drawing on the slacker rock of Pavement, the screaming of Frank Black, the aggression of Nirvana and the lazy funkiness of Beck (and yet more than a sum of their influences), they’ve received critical acclaim in Scandinavia and Germany alike.
These chemical molecules travel to the brain damaging the serotonin inhibitors from recycling. Antidepressant drugs are producing serotonin only in the synapse. Naturally, serotonin usually recycles itself over and over again, basically producing more and more. But when you are taking prozac, zoloft, praxil, or luvox that recycling pattern is eliminated, so instead getting constant does of this monoamine neurotransmitter these drugs will just give you an impulse from the receiving nerve. You will feel less depress temporarily until the serotonin becomes depleted. Yes, depleted so you’ll become anxious for more serotonin and the doctor ups your dosage.

So why would the Thai government even consider sending so many refugees back to Burma considering the circumstances and the detrimental affect it would have on the Thai economy? The relationship between the two countries has always been rocky ever since the first Burmese attack on what was then called the Kingdom of Siam in the 1500s. The modern governments have been trying to maintain good ties through trade and mutual support, and Thailand even supported the entrance of Burma into ASEAN, despite international outcry. Burma, at times, has accused Thailand of supporting rebel troops who take refuge in the camps and periodically attack the Burmese military. Could this be an attempt for Thailand to show its cooperation with the Burmese government by returning its people, and more importantly, delivering the ‘rebels’ into the hands of the military?

NTV’s The Trend. What trend? The only thing I see trending when it airs is boredom which is unfortunate since the show is presented by one James Smart. The sad irony is that James Smart isn’t even well dressed to start with. His questions are lame and un-smart and he picks topics on events that happened decades ago, for instance bringing Robert Alai on the show. I do not refute that he probably saved mankind with his famous scream that reportedly rebuffed an Alien invasion; or that the US thought the self-proclaimed ’22 year old’ was the human version of Power Puff Girls, who also have a cute but formidable Super Sonic scream. But why bring back something that happened and trended months ago? I will forgive anything, except typos and backward people. The trend is the latter and the fact of the matter is #TheTrend is a tragic imitation of Aljazeera’s #TheStream.

It was certainly one way to prepare them for what was ahead. For all that the emigrants to Australia had so much further to go, they were actually well looked after by the arrangements put in place by the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners (CLEC) with required lists of clothing, specified dietary standards, a surgeon to supervise their health and a matron to take care of their other welfare. Education was often offered but not always availed.

This leaves an aircraft with a slated 37-ton capacity over 1,780 nautical miles coming in as a sub-30 ton machine, compared with the 20-ton capacity of the RAF's C-130Js. But then the C-130Js are currently priced at £38-40 million, against the A400M which at current euro exchange rates works out at £98 million – well over twice the price for considerably less than a fifty percent increase in load-carrying capacity.

Coping with Chloe is a sensitive, touching, sometimes humorous portrayal of how grief and bereavement affect people differently but it's also surprisingly intriguing and this, for me, is its greatest strength. I love the ambiguity of the story, the fact that the reader can interpret Anna's experiences in different and personal ways.
The premise of Julianne Snow’s new Days with the Undead appealed to me at once because it is told as a survivor’s diary, reviving the oldest and original form of plague narrative. I remember reading Defoe’s Journal of the Plague Year in college, and many of the passages in it — the people being bound to their beds so they would not run naked and feverish into the streets screaming; the heaps of bodies; the fire — remain with me to this day. So it is with considerable delight that I see Julianne Snow reviving this form in her debut novel. Worth checking out!

Britain’s educational establishment is similarly dysfunctional. In an effort to promote egalitarianism, the “Conservative” coalition has decided to legally persecute middle-class children by putting the socio-economic background of potential students ahead of their intellectual capacity, thus ensuring a larger pool of disadvantaged students who will subsequently, and quite extraordinarily, be allowed to use iPods “to help them concentrate” during exams.
The Royalists sense an opportunity to roll it up but somehow lose their "luck of the devil" General in a freak 'I read it in the rules' moment of DBR history - an odd/even roll on a troop type in an enemy/friendly bound that results in a push back being turned into a kill (or something) when 'the moon hangs over yonder tree'. To his great and ever lasting credit it was the Royalist player pointed this out to a bemused group of DBR players who were lost in the complexity of DBR arcane law. Reading the various sets of DBx rules is sometimes more "legalese" than common wargaming sense but the upshot was that the Royalists were suddenly within a hair's breath of going demoralised (see below, the Royalist General had been in the top left corner bit is now 'gone' to Parliaments amazement).

Thor: Thor is one of the characters I connect to the least, and honestly it’s still here too. I liked his scenes with Loki, his frustration with his brother and his true wish to connect with him, to bring him back from the edge. His remorse for what was happening to the Earth was genuine, and he had some great lines and fights in the movie. Do I think he was a stand out in this? Not really. For whatever reason I just don’t click with Thor. I’d like to, and I liked his story just fine, it simply didn’t pull me in the way everyone else did. His entrance to the movie was great though, except kind of a lame way around the bridge being destroyed: they just used dark power to do it. Meeeeeh.

In the future, teens rent their bodies to seniors who want to be young again. One girl discovers her renter plans to do more than party--her body will commit murder, if her mind can't stop it. Sixteen-year-old Callie lost her parents when the genocide spore wiped out everyone except those who were vaccinated first--the very young and very old. With no grandparents to claim Callie and her little brother, they go on the run, living as squatters, and fighting off unclaimed renegades who would kill for a cookie. Hope comes via Prime Destinations, run by a mysterious figure known only as The Old Man. He hires teens to rent their bodies to seniors, known as enders, who get to be young again. Callie's neurochip malfunctions and she wakes up in the life of her rich renter, living in her mansion, driving her cars, even dating Blake, the grandson of a senator. It's a fairy-tale new life . . . until she uncovers the Body Bank's horrible plan. . . .

Is it appropriate to send Editor X an advance copy of my novel as a gesture of friendship? How do I make it clear that I sent it because he loves books, not because he has connections? My friendship with him is very important to me, and I want to make it on my own, so perhaps I shouldn't send it at all. But maybe he'll be offended that I didn't think of him when gifting copies...! What do I do?You're probably over-thinking this. Editor X will not expect you to send him a free copy of your book; if you decide not to, he won't be offended. All editors know how many friends authors have, and know you can't possibly give all your friends free copies. (Also, would it kill them to support their friend and BUY the book?)

“Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame” (ver. 19). What is reproach? What is confusion? What shame? Reproach is that which the enemy casteth in the teeth. Confusion is that which gnaweth the conscience. Shame is that which causeth even a noble brow to blush, because of the upbraiding with a pretended crime. There is no crime; or even if there is a crime, it doth not belong to him, against whom it is alleged: but yet the infirmity of the human mind ofttimes is made ashamed even when a pretended crime is alleged; not because it is alleged, but because it is believed. All these things are in the Body of the Lord. For confusion in Him could not be, in whom guilt was not found. There was alleged as a crime against Christians, the very fact that they were Christians. That indeed was glory: the brave gladly received it, and so received it as that they blushed not at all for the Lord’s name. For fearlessness had covered the face of them, having the effrontery of Paul, saying, “for I blush not because of the Gospel: for the virtue of God it is for salvation to every one believing.” O Paul, art not thou a venerator of the Crucified? Little it is, he saith, for me not to blush for it: nay, therein alone I glory, wherefore the enemy thinketh me to blush. “But from me far be it to glory, save in the Cross of Jesus Christ, through whom to me the world is crucified, and I to the world.” At such a brow as this then reproach alone could be hurled. For neither could there be confusion in a conscience already made whole, nor shame in a brow so free. But when it was being alleged against certain that they had slain Christ, deservedly they were pricked through with evil conscience, and to their health confounded and converted, so that they could say, “Thou hast known my confusion.” Thou therefore, O Lord, hast known not only my reproach but also my confusion, in certain shame also: who, though in me they believe, publicly blush to confess me before ungodly men, human tongue having more influence with them than promise divine. Behold ye therefore them: even such are commended to God, not that so He may leave them, but that by aiding them He may make them perfect. For a certain man believing and wavering hath said, “I believe, O Lord, help Thou mine unbelief.”
You might be asking yourself, "Who cares about the community? I don't care about those people, I just want to see the ratings." And you're absolutely right in asking. I don't think Yelp is going to fold just because the communities are less loyal, less active, but I know that I'm going to shift how I categorize Yelp. Yelp to me is turning into a search tool, a very useful one at that. I frequently listen and read Jason Calicanus and Fred Wilson's blogs and podcast, and both of them use Yelp (mobile too). But I've never heard or read of Jason or Fred commenting about feeling right at home with the Yelp community. Most of the comments are about the search features. I too really like the search feature on Yelp mobile. I can drive into a new location, hit find close to me button, and start weeding it through. However, one time late at night, Yelp recommended that I get dinner at the Yellow Rose, the gentlemen's club. I declined that recommendation. The numbers geek inside me really likes that you can get more data. While there is more noise in Yelp data (variability in reviews), if I didn't know the source, I would rather look at the reviews of 100 people instead of 5 people. Statistically, more reviews are more favorable.
If possible, have the list owner write the emails and endorsements. If they’d prefer, you can write those emails in their names and just have them edit it until they feel comfortable putting their name on it.
Was it a sign? Was it an omen? OMG, what if I'm supposed to back out? Pre-wedding jitters? You bet your butt.
To prevent just that, I stuck some Glad press-n-seal plastic wrap over 3/4 of the bowl, leaving just enough space to get the whisk attachment in and move it around, so that the flying bits of butter and sugar would hit the top of the plastic rather than coating everything around the bowl in its fury to whip butter and sugar together. Plan A was going along just fine for the first five seconds and then Grrshwislsgnjtsoiht!!!!! the plastic wrap got sucked around the whisk and I looked up to see that the front of my t-shirt had bits of butter and sugar stuck to it, as well as Mei’s face and shirt, Patella’s back and head, the counter, the ceiling, the wall, and couple of things on the counter. I nearly cried. Why couldn’t this work?

Ok, I will admit that some plays do not translate well when read in a droning manner by a high schooler being forced by the teacher to read out loud. Just remember that Romeo and Juliet were teenagers themselves – passionate and hot-headed. Forbidden love is the most desirable, especially for teens, and Shakespeare knew it.
In mid-May, pins of each beer were tapped in Woolwich, South London, and I was one of a dozen or so people to take part in a blind tasting of them. Beer style purists would have disappeared in a twisted spiral of smoke at the extraordinary diversity of beers all supposedly brewed to the same quite distinct style. There were some awful ones, some OK ones and some fabulous ones. Some of the latter were from the people you would expect, others were surprising (it was supposed to be blind - I made a note of what they were afterwards). I'm not going to go into more detail now, because I want to wait until we taste them in St Petersburg and compare the effect of the journey.
Equally he needs to enhance Theo Walcott’s improvements. Too many of his detractors highlight his inconsistent performances without recognising his improved productivity. That would increase with consistency but Walcott is often underappreciated. A balance to me, would be three or four players hitting double figures as well as Theo and van Persie.
So here I go to inform them about this award but before concluding this, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all my Blogger friends for encouraging me time n again with their valuable comments n reactions....and my special thanks to all those friends who don't write their own Blog but do like to read Blogs and give their views.

And after these few weeks, with having no name to call myself, I feel almost completly connected with God. I understand him better and I feel that my gifts have increased. My love for people has developed into this overwhelming feeling, one that I can’t even explain. I do not regret my decision to cut myself off from all forms of religion. I am just a lover of Jesus.
Imagine that you have planned a huge surprise, and it leaks out before time – how will you feel? Ditto is the situation with Anurag Basu, the director of Barfi!.
The approach taken with the HCR legislation is based on a not unreasonable calculus, and is the kind of compromise we get in a representative democracy largely co-opted by powerful economic interests who now have full citizenship after Citizens United v.
there is also the nuclear radiation issues of the Dai-Ichi nuclear plant in fukushima. a silent and deadly killer. radiated debris is now being spread throughout japan by bureaucratic idiots without common sense. these fools are taking known contaminated trash and debris from affected areas and moving them to various incineration plants throught japan and having the debris burned. burning releases minimal particles. the most dangerous is the ash from the contaminated debris. i wonder where this concentrated and deadly-distilled ash is being placed ? landfills ? recycled somewhere ? hindsight 20/20 ?
Thirteen years of Labour governance have certainly taken their toll. Andrew Neather's revelation that Ministers had deliberately encouraged immigration in order to "rub the Right's nose in diversity" and for a "political purpose" proved what many people like myself had strongly suspected - that immigration wasn't about economics, but social engineering and the destruction of Britain. Around 2.3 million immigrants have entered the United Kingdom legally under Labour's administration, that's more than a 50% increase on the ethnic minority population residing in the UK in 2001/02, according to the Office of National Statistics' figures:

In the bloody aftermath of the attack, the world was left awestruck in how well Iran countered the offensive. After witnessing the debilitating injuries Iran caused the US the smell of blood coming from a wounded prey turned China, Russia and India into unrelenting prisons.. Hundreds of thousands of Russian and Chinese sleeper agents within the United States were activated. The Chinese triggered the kill switches they built into all US civilian and military computers and electronic devices and the US military quickly realized they should have taken their US made only mandate more seriously. The rise of globalism and the intricacies of the global financial markets was another Achilles heel. China unleashes their assassins mace launching attacks on US military bases and naval assets in the Pacific within a matter of hours.

She is always participating in challenges, offering us wonderful inspiration with her awesome talent! About a month ago, Karen had to have surgery for two brain aneurysms. She is still in the hospital and we are having this blog to inspire more of you out there to send in some cards to Karen AND to her family that is caring for her too! So hope you feel inspired with our little hop for you today. Below you will find all of the links to all of the girls participating...these are from the CSS Alumni group and the Design Team from Gina K Designs. Enjoy and be inspired to send a card or two in!
Using a screw and some glue David fixes my guitar which broke on the bus and I strum a few tunes. He shows us pieces of jade carved into the shapes of faces and animals, explaining slyly that they have been taken illegally from nearby Mayan ruins. Leaning in close with a mischievous glint in his eyes and a hint of rum on his breath, he tells us that he knows where there are much more of these precious ornaments and that he plans to export them overseas on the black market for lots of money. His wife and daughters roll their eyes as though they’ve heard this plan a thousand times before. I sit back

Beiswenger is looking for damages of anywhere in between $1.05m and $5.25m, but that’s not all. He’s also looking to block the forthcoming Assassin’s Creed III and future releases in the franchise. That was a mistake that has led fans to “review-bomb” his books on Amazon. Review-bombing is the “art” of maliciously writing a scathing review for an item or giving it the lowest possible rating purely to spite the author or artist. Well, that’s my definition of it, at least.

Throughout the church age, here is what God said of the two witnesses who operated within the churches. We read in Revelation 11:6:
The problem here was that the victory conditions for this scenario depended on numbers of figures. First side to kill 50% of the opponent´s troops would win. This meant the Evil player had to kill 12 figures, while the Good side only 9.

I'm enjoying looking through these photos again, and re-living a special time. We have not braved the busy roads this Easter, and have been interspersing a bit of work with a bit of relaxation at home. I'm feeling saddened by political events next door in South Africa, and rather depressed about it all, so luckily found the time to escape into the blog world for a little while.
The purpose of the event is to inform the public about safety concerns, and a table and tent for the Building Bridges Bike Day will be located in the center of the Green Market at Grand Army Plaza on this Saturday afternoon. Participants will coordinate between the local riders and pedestrians to create a greater awareness of rules, regulations, and safe streets in New York City.

Late one night, after some hellraising, Tom and his girlfriend Abby (Mary Larkin) are hanging out in a graveyard because they’re so cool and that’s what you do after running an old square off the road of an evening. Whilst basking in the warm afterglow of roadside carnage and the death of random members of the 70s public, Tom finds a frog and decides that he will take the little fellow home to his mother (aforementioned British comedy icon Beryl Reid). Now this may seem like an odd gift for a mother (or indeed a British comedy icon), but, it transpires that Ma Latham (Beryl Reid) is in fact something of an occult dabbler and frogs are like boxes of chocolates or Heartbeat DVDs to her, so when Tom arrives home to the stately family pile old Ma fresh from a séance is thrilled with her son’s thoughtful gift. Equally impressed, family butler Shadwell (George Sanders) helpfully comments that this particular frog is a rare kind of frog that is particularly advantageous to black magic rituals and we then learn in a spectacular display of confusion and vagueness that the family home has a mysterious locked room that his father once raided in order to learn the secret of immortality, and then he died there, presumably without learning any secrets pertaining to immortality. Like any decent teenager this kind of jive is like whining guitar music to his ears and despite things not ending well for Da Latham Tom badgers Beryl Reid until keys are handed over and he then enters the locked room to discover the secrets for himself. More confusion and vagueness follows in the form of a series of unspecific visions involving Beryl Reid probably selling baby Tom’s soul and some other suitably 70s stuff and then Tom triumphantly exits the room of devilish magic proclaiming he now knows the secrets of life beyond death.

The St. Louis Rams are Indianapolis Colts both together were the worst teams in the NFL last season. They tied for the worst records and therefore it was a coin flip who got the first pick (It’s not really a coin flip, but the means does not matter). The rams ended up getting the second pick. The colts went ahead and made everyone aware that they were going to take Andrew Luck. One of the highest rated players coming out of college for a long time. I think since John Elway and Peyton Manning. Andrew Luck is considered pro ready after his play at Stanford. Robert Griffin III won the Heisman and became the next elite quarterback to come out of this years draft. His college play and his combine workouts made him another player coaches with quarterback concerns were drooling over. The Rams sat back and waited for the best offer. The Rams have a young quarterback in Sam Bradford that they are happy with (so am I) and know they just need to get him some weapons and support. The Redskins stepped up and the Rams made the trade and gain the 6th pick in this years draft, 39th pick in this years draft, and first round picks for 2013 and 2014. Thus setting them up to have two first round picks in the next two seasons. The Rams went ahead and used the 39th pick but not before they re traded the 6th pick for the 14th pick and the 45th pick.That 45th pick they traded for they went ahead and traded that for the 50th pick and the 150th pick. If I haven’t lost you yet these are all good moves. The Rams moved back only several of spots, appeared to still get their man, and gained more draft picks.
"Gluten is ubiquitous."What are the odds? I haven't posted about a word in weeks, nay, months. Three hours after posting this, I run across the word for the second time today, in the book review and in a random magazine in the doctor's waiting room. Coincidences are the spice of life.

I like to keep a couple of these podcasts on my iPad at a time. If things are going “crazy” around the home, the best strategy is to sit down and read a story with them but sometimes I might be in the middle of cooking dinner or bathing a baby and I just can’t get to it. These podcasts are the next best thing and my children will listen and watch with rapt attention. While the podcast is no substitute for my own story time with the children, they fill the gap with a bit of peace. My children have sought out particular titles and found other books by the authors featured as a result of watching the podcasts, and they each have their favourite stories that we watch again and again.

Pigovian taxes - those taxes that adjust the private costs of consuming a good with the true social costs - are popular in the alcoholic beverage market. Brewers often complain of excessive taxation: that the current level of taxation adds up to more than the social cost and is, in fact, punitive.
I’ve been reading a lot of ‘doctrine’ books lately. You know, books that explain things, teach things and so on. This book was refreshing, because it was story, and I devoured it.
There was no person to represent her from her wonderful current preschool, because all the preschools on the island are private, and therefore not even obliged to even accept children with additional needs (you may or may not be aware that Jaime was already asked to leave our first choice of very expensive, exclusive preschool, apparently because she wasn't potty trained. Not because they had grossly underestimated how much time and effort it might take to include a child with special needs, and decided they didn't fancy the task after all. No. It was just because she wasn't fully potty trained. Honest).

I have also heard that sometimes dreams are the basis for stories or novels. I know I have had some of those dreams. They are the ones we remember for years. For example, the dream about being at a university on the moon, eating lunch. Seriously, I actually had that dream. Or the one about travelling to the future where we all lived up in the clouds because we trashed the planet in our own time. It appears I am a science fiction nerd even when I sleep. I did try to write a story about the one with the college, but haven’t gotten far on that.

I am typing while I wait for my “dog pikelets” to cook. They aren’t actually my dog pikelets…I am home alone dog sitting while Steve does the fortnightly shopping 50km away and have 2 sulking dogs who haven’t had a walk yet. Much like children, dogs can be somewhat distracted from actively sulking by waving food under their noses and so after heading out to let the chooks out of their coop and having feral cats follow me the whole way looking pitiful and having seen them catch rats the other day thus earning at least something in return I decided to give the chooks, cats and dogs a bit of a cold morning treat. I headed in to the cupboards and discovered that there wasn’t all that much there that would interest a cat, dog or even a chook. We have reached that time of the fortnight where shopping becomes less of a chore and more of a necessity. I had to get creative with what was available…1 large container of out of date thickened cream (still smelling fine…)…3 free range eggs that our hens have decided to spring on us of late…1 tin of tuna found at the back of the cupboard…2 semi floppy carrots found in the crisper (note to self “CLEAN THE CRISPER”!…sigh…) add a bit of Self-Raising flour and a bit of left over lard from making pork pie pastry to fry it all in. An instant human heart attack but bliss for animal-kind. They don’t look all that bad and 4 of them have disappeared into the dogs so I think I am on to a winner. Consider that my recipe for hump day. Technically these would be fritters rather than pikelets but I have the ump with New Zealand (home of the fritter) at the moment for selling themselves to the highest bidder (in this case China) and for allowing themselves to be the food laundering capital of the world. Your reputation is plummeting New Zealand and if I check a label and see “New Zealand” on it, I won’t buy it because it is a veneer for “Chinese Import”. Almost all of our frozen vegetables are routed through New Zealand from China to give them a fake façade of clean and green and New Zealand is allowing this to their own detriment. That’s why these are pikelets (still semi-New Zealand but like Pavlovas and Anzac biscuits… WE MADE THEM FIRST! ;o). There you go…I couldn’t let a Monday go past without having a bit of a rant albeit a small one (I will say this for the last time this post… Time machine people…that is how I can jump around from the past to the present so easily…)
Big Daddy brought Spawn to one of William's baseball games last week. I looked at him, for just moment, and watched the man I used to be married to lovingly hold his progeny and talk softly, sweetly to him. I saw him pointing out the action on the field to that little product of his and Secretary's ill-begotten romance, that human being born out of a dirty cluster of lies and deceit and cruelty. I wanted to approach him and ask him, "How long until you run away from this one? How long before you decide he's too much work? How can you sit here and act like you're a man, a father, in front of the children you abandoned?". He stayed for a little bit, and then left. Left for his new life with his perfect wife and their perfect child. Henry was at the game with me, and as we were packing up to go home I asked him, "Did you talk to your dad?". Henry shrugged, and said, "Well, I was walking over there to say hi and he turned around and left."
As stated I like the Illyria run of episodes quite a bit better than most people. That’s ok, I’ll allow for personal differences. I am however a little confused how You’re Welcome was the 1 rated show by other people. It certainly isn’t bad, but man is it not the best. Cordelia returns and that’s kind of nice, but Cordelia was in four seasons of other episodes and many of them aren’t ranked so hot. I was prepared to see it rated higher, but not all the way at the top. I’m much more in the new, than revisiting the old. Now I will shake my head in disgust.

There's so much that goes into making "Caged Fury" a trash classic, from the gratuitous nudity to the only-semi-choreographed action scenes to the tone-shifting madness of the plot. If I was forced to pick a single factor that seals my love for this movie, it would have to be the acting. Performances run the gamut from "stilted" to "hammy" to "hot fuckin' mess," and they are never less than delicious to watch. Erik Estrada has put the better part of a decade between himself and "CHiPs" and it's a little difficult to buy him as a roguish male lead, but that doesn't stop him from continuing to rock Ponch's cocky attitude. For my money, Richard Barathy's Dirk is the more amazing hero--he's a judo-chopping, high-kicking, brick-breaking force of vintage action movie manliness. With only four IMDb credits to his name (including a turn as "Karate Biker" in the Lorenzo Lamas vehicle "Snake Eater," which I highly recommend if you love testosterone-fueled idiocy as much as I do), Barathy makes his sole leading-role appearance a memorable one. In a sequence that tells you most of what you need to know about "Caged Fury," Dirk is in a pagoda, outfitted in a karate uniform, breaking bricks with his bare fists before hopping onto his motorcycle to go dole out some fist-flavored justice.

24 hours of sobriety did something strange to me.

The fear that sobriety could turn me into an observational comedian was enough to keep me drinking.

Now the funny news. The term “native speaker” means ‘monolingual’: all the native speakers to whom second/foreign language learners have been compared since it became standard practice to do so are monolinguals. Given that language learners are becoming multilingual – those who already aren’t, that is – such comparisons reflect the belief that ideal users of language are monolingual (rings a bell?). Indeed, multilinguals who become multilinguals from birth are not native speakers of their languages, because multilinguals across the board are also routinely compared to native speakers, and you can’t compare a thing to itself. Even funnier, multilinguals are not non-native speakers either, because they are also compared to non-natives. Makes one wonder what multilinguals are.

Also, I'm looking for writing buddies! The easiest way to get to the 50,000 mark is to engage in some friendly competition and get support and encouragement from other crazies who have decided to take this challenge on. If any of you are interested, check out my NaNoWriMo profile and friend me!
Connect with someone and brag to each other. Don’t compete with each other, celebrate each other’s success. Jon Acuff calls it the “bragging table.” Jon gets together with a friend to enjoy bragging sessions.
South Africa won a huge war against the combined forces of mighty Russia and communist Cuba, because it was a fair fight. the South African Defence Force had the superior motivation, determination, the superior strategy and equipment. Our men had superior training under the command of the best tacticians and experts in warfare. In a fair fight where it was strength measured against strength South Africa had to win against the strongest military forces in the World, because at the time South Africa was recognised as the third strongest military force on earth. There were numerous other factors of course, such the fact that we knew the terrain, our vehicles and equipment were developed and tested for the terrain and for the particular battle, we are the masters of guerilla warfare, and many other factors. The fact remains that it was a fair fight where the strongest, best adapted, best prepared and equipped WON!
On a quest, I am trying to rein in my thoughts and desires. Seems they become somewhat big and unmanageable. So I thought back and took a look deeper. The journey is never-ending but the goals got distorted. Many times they become the goals of those around us. So here is a simple list for now (just fishing related):

As one of the few studies of MAOA that lays out such racial prevalences, this study is quite an enigma to me. One might expect a study of nearly 1,500 subjects to more accurately reflect reality than smaller studies, but the study apparently discovered no subjects with the 2-repeat allele, which has a markedly greater association with violence than the 3-repeat allele that has received so much attention. Other studies, like one of 1,100 American males by Guo et al, found that 1% of American males possess this allele. MAOA is on the X chromosome, of which females have two, giving the Sabol et al study well over 2,000 chromosomes to examine. Therefore, I would have expected about 20 or so chromosomes to have the 2-repeat allele, instead of none.

I think, in part, this may have been because I was trying to do too much. I had multiple POV characters - one of which was a child - and was trying to tackle themes like faith vs. reason. I can also see now that I didn't clearly identify what was at stake for my characters.

As we enter the 24 solar cycle, it is predicted that the sun spot activity is going to be the highest it's ever been in recorded history. The last time the sun had a major solar cycle it created the great geomagnetic storm of 1859 known as the "Carrington Event" after astronomer Richard Carrington. This solar storm electrified transmission cables, set fires in telegraph offices, and skies all over planet Earth erupted in red, green, and purple auroras so brilliant that newspapers could be read as easily as in daylight. These bright auroras pulsated even at near tropical latitudes including Cuba, the Bahamas, Jamaica, El Salvador, and Hawaii.

At a recent family dinner, I served something I haven't made in years, and consider a little retro — stuffed peppers. Do people still make these? Maybe I'm just out of touch because I'm not that fond of peppers, and don't cook with them very often, but I have to admit, they were good.

Those untouched by grace do not get it. They are the ones who come before God with a laundry list of their accomplishments and gifts and achievements talking out loud to God and saying, “God what can I give to you?” They have to do this because, as people who have everything already, there is nothing left for God to give them. They don’t need his grace because they don’t want it. They don’t want his grace because they don’t need it.

Nine lives, of people living in different places and having different religious beliefs and practices, yet dedicated to a way of life based on their religion. Some ascetics, some prostitutes, and some somewhere in between. By telling their stories, Dalrymple makes it possible to catch brief glimpses of Indian “religion”, without imposing too much of a Western framework on it.

In rules terms we have the usual division of time into turns and rounds, plus simple mechanisms for tiredness, weight, darkness, lack of air and gravity, doors and traps, and of course awarding experience. And that's it. The lack of detail here is also likely due to this being a playtest draft and the core target audience - the OSR - being creative enough and experienced enough to know exactly what to do next. That said, after reading through this one pdf, even a non-roleplayer ought to have the itch to get started and enough material to feel the way in, step by strange step.
It reminds us that God is on the side of healing. He healed through Jesus, He healed through the disciples. He has healed people throughout history. As we pray for God’s healing and blessing, we know we’re praying according to His will. He is willing and He is able to heal.

Jaxon's personality is starting to show through. He has become such a little giggle monster! He loves to play peek-a-boo and laughs at every funny noise you can make. I can tell I'm going to have a man who likes to throw temper tantrums though. The past couple of nights at dinner time he keeps arching his back when I try to put him in his high chair and he starts to fuss looking at Jake and I eat. I spoon fed him some milk and he did a pretty good job with it! He'd open his mouth real wide when the spoon got near him. Even though more than half of it ended up on him and not in his tummy, I think he's ready to try cereal. When Jake gets back from San Francisco we'll give him some oatmeal cereal.
* Speaking of simplifying....we canceled our cable. I can't remember the last time we did not have cable. It has been almost a week now. I was dying the first night. My hubby was at work and he got a lot of texts from me complaining. It is getting better. I've been reading or spending more time on my iphone. Most of the time though, I'm so tired I fall asleep on the couch by 9 anyways. ha. We also have Netflix. Eventually, we will probably get Hulu. Anyone have hulu? What do you think?

The next day our sweet nurse Kate arranged for another pediatrician to pay us a visit. Dr. Reuter completely made up for the former pediatrician’s perceived lack of compassion. Here was a man who lovingly took my newborn daughter into his grand, gentle hands, held her close and softly stroked her tiny head full of dark hair. To this man, Nora was a baby, not a diagnosis. Instead of taking Nora into the adjoining room to examine her, he asked if he could examine her right there on the bed, that way William and I could both be present. My heart swelled with emotion and gratitude as Dr. Reuter proceeded to get down on his knees to get a better look at this sweetest of babies. He understood our concerns and took the time to answer our questions. He wanted to know all about our journey to that point with genuine interest and compassion. The comfort and love that emanated from this man was just what we needed. He was a true Godsend. As he left our room, we both got emotional, thanking God for sending Dr. Reuter right when we needed him.

"Edward Enfield sets off on his latest cycling trip, carrying few preconceptions but plenty of wit, along the banks of the Danube from Passau to Vienna, taking in castles, churches and good food along the way. As Edward amply reveals in this charming book, there is no place from which to see a country that is nearly as good as the saddle of a bicycle." Acquired (at very low cost) because of a trip along the Danube planned for next year. Very short, easy to read, gently humorous and mostly interesting. It isn't terribly informative about the tourist sights, but if I ever wished to go on a long-distance cycling trip in Germany or Austria, I'd probably take his advice. But it's even lighter (and shorter) than the Stephen Fry above, so I'll be attacking something with a bit more heft next.

We shoveled for about an hour this morning to get the driveway clear (our neighbor did the sidewalks with his snowblower; gotta get him a sixpack!), and I made the mistake of taking the Jetta out to get the snow off it out in the road...didn't I get it stuck just as the ambulance that had been sitting down the street for half an hour wanted to leave? Yes, I did.

‘Samaras has also said he would reject a coalition administration, but has nevertheless been a bit yes and no about it. In many ways he is right to be equivocal: with perhaps nine Parties likely to win seats in the new Parliament, it is impossible at the moment to foresee all the possibilities. But I understand that Samaris would welcome a Coalition without PASOK.’

When I am present, I feel like a giant child – like I have no concept of proper social behavior.

If 10 to 15 people are on vacation to Florida, then vacation villas are considered best compared to hotels. As there are so many people they may require 2 to 3 hotel rooms to stay while all the people can stay in one place in vacation rental homes. In such a way they can save money and enjoy the vacation.

There can be many generations of carriers in a family without anyone being born with the disease, and being a carrier 'will not cause you to be ill or shorten your life in any way.'

Things get even more complicated when she meets her father for the very first time--and he's in a coma. As Janie uncovers his secret past, she begins to realize that the choice thought she had has more dire consequences than she ever imagined.

The 'military occupation' nonsense is comical, since the majority of those who identify themselves as 'Palestinians' live under full 'Palestinian' control, in Gaza and in area C in Judea and Samaria. But putting that aside, from Mr. Areikat's statement I assume that he and the 'Palestinans' would thus have no problem whatsoever with Israel transferring those members of its population who identify as 'Palestinians' from Israel to their new reichlet, correct?

Jesus said that the poor would always be with us. We will never solve poverty. We will never solve these natural disasters that occur with amazing frequency and severity. But perhaps the reason the poor will always be here is to remind us that we have an obligation to love. And we need to love. We need to love strategically, and we shouldn't do anything that exacerbates problems. But I do believe in love. And when I'm standing before Jesus, I don't want to give Him all the reasons why I didn't love--because it was such a basketcase it deserved it, and it was to teach the people a lesson, and it was to let the state fail because it was already a failed state--I want to simply be able to tell Him that I did what I could, because I knew I was His hands and His feet here on earth.

Additionally, where will this demand for private information stop? Will employers demand access to your bank account to ensure you are properly managing your money?

It turned out the man was from Hong Kong and had studied business at some New Jersey college. After he graduated he decided to work for an American company for one year to get experience. He got a job as a sales agent at Quill, a job to recruit new customers. He put on the best suit he knew to get, put the contracts in a business bag and started walking the hood. In my building he started from the bottom floors and was kicked out from every single space (they are mostly carpenters here, with no fancy Epson printers). Undeterred by the failure, he continued on till reached the top floor. Me.

As I matured and witnessed and cheered Israel’s survival, I learned more about the rich history of Jews in America. I read with a shiver of pride George Washington’s Letter to the Jewish congregation in Rhode Island. Heartened by Israel’s “Never Again”, I knew with certainty that “Never in America” was an absolute. I read Jewish biographies like Harry Golden’s For Two Cents Plain, books about urban Jewish childhoods. I envied the survival instincts of these, my religious forebears.

7. Three minutes later, an SUV pulls up and this really fit dude pops out of the truck and comes barreling towards us. I see that he has his fist cocked a little. I put my daughter down and send her to go and play, which she was grateful for. I could feel just how tense and anxious she became. This guy comes up and started screaming at me. Before fatherhood, I would have gone at him, but I have been trying to change that part of myself; violence is a social ingredient that I am weaning myself from. When he finally paused, I asked him did he think that yelling and threatening me was going to do any good? I then asked him why neither he nor his wife had asked Miriam what had happened. I then asked them, “If I were a white dude, would you still think that I pushed your daughter?” That stopped them. All this time that the silly adults are going at it, little Miriam is clinging to her mother’s legs, terrified. “Your daughter fell, and I helped her up.” I focused on the mother: “And if you weren’t so busy looking at your phone, if you were actually parenting, you would have seen what happened. Better yet, it might not have even happened if you were playing with us.” Then I looked at the dad: “I can appreciate your concern, but if this is how you react to situations you know nothing about, you might get hurt. If this was two years ago, I would have beat the shit out of you for yelling in my face and pretending like you were going to do something.” I then bent down and asked Miriam if she was okay. She looked at her parents, and then at me, and nodded. I took out a wipe and wiped her scraped cheek. “Does it feel better now?” She nodded. I gave her dad the dirty wipe, and went to go and play with my daughter.

As with every other season here in Michigan, I am always reminded how much I love living in such a naturally beautiful state, as spring time sets in. My reminder today came in the form of a family of geese (3 babies sandwiched between mom and dad) as they made their way across the street in front of me. However, beyond the spring time, this time of year also brings another celebration of Michigan –the “Night for Notables.”
Daddy has already been to Zuma, on behalf of work. He gets to dine with his international suppliers at these international restaurants and end up eating some of the most delicious meals. After which he comes home and raves about it to me and my mother. Now my mother can’t be too bothered by this but me being my daddy’s daughter, sharing his enthusiasm for food, cannot help but drool when I hear all this. Luckily for me, daddy knows me well and he agrees that we must gorge on a meal at Zuma soon. Given my mother’s serious dislike for Japanese, this day was not really planned.
Digital tools, for example, are transforming our conceptions of and theorizing about “archives” as well as our actual use of these repositories, be they material or virtual entities. Similarly, digital facsimiles are exercising various effects on our understanding of original documents. Our digital environment is shaping the kinds of archival projects being undertaken, the methodologies used, and/or the types of research questions posed. Interactions between the digital and the archival are creating new paradigms or inspiring shifts in existing models of document preservation, audiences, access, and more. The advent of the digital archive, for instance, has afforded a ready means for humanities scholars to engage the public in their scholarship. Finally, digital tools and platforms are addressing and reconfiguring questions concerning the economics, equity, and accessibility of archival materials.
I printed the bee's from Create A Critter and stamped the faces with Peachy Keen's Cornies faces. The frames were cut from Accent Essentials and I cut an extra one for a template. With the template frame, I lined it up over the bee where I wanted it and traced it. I then cut the bee into a square 1/8 inch smaller than the frame and glued the frame to the bee square. The flowers were cut from Mother's Day Bouquet and I added brads to the centers. For the center one I stamped the sentiment. I made the matching envelope using a framed bee, a decorative strip of paper which I added a punched border to.

Well for one thing it would be in The O2 in Dublin but we get Julian’s thoughts on how Ireland would create an entertaining while at the same time different contest from those of recent years.

When they apply to open a Mosque the authorities think it is something harmless, like a local church. They hide in the comforting illusion that Islam is “a religion of peace.” But underneath the rulers are capitulating, betraying us to an enemy who will visit vengeance on our next generations for wrongs committed by these same rulers who invaded their homelands in Iraq and Afghanistan in an unjustified invasion and bombed their women and children! They think they can make Muslim countries Western and assimilate everyone here!

We moved Nutty into the infirmary coop this past week. She still ate fine. She walked around. She had a heat lamp focused on her all the time, which she enjoyed. If the heat lamp was turned off she got upset, and so I left it on all the time, and she stood right under it. She was pooping fine. The issue was in her reproductive tract, not her digestive tract.

This is why teachers in China stay on the important lessons for a LONG time and devote an entire 45 minute class to ONE PROBLEM. And also why they don't care about the right result as much as the questions, the explanations, the findings, the relationships, the connections, the examples, applications, contradictions, advantages. They write something on the wall and ask the students: is this a sick or a healthy 'patient'? Meaning if they are looking at a right mathematical statement or at something faulty. They play DOCTOR and try to find what's wrong and how to cure it. And as in real life, there are more than one solution, and they have to discuss why some are different and which can be more adequate.

I'm about 24 weeks pregnant. I've had it pretty easy this time, first trimester was relatively cruisy, just had some indigestion and tiredness but nothing like the constant nausea (and occasional puke) that I had with the girls. I'm in second tri now and I am starting to feel the effect of the third pregnancy.

Have you heard of Eats on Feets Community Breast Milk Sharing? well that was all started by my poop-stirring midwife!!! To me, Shell is nothing short of amazing and I cherish every time we get to hang out. Google her and check out all of the wonderful, informative and controversial stuff she has started with her 'audacity' to match milk donors with milk recipients without any money being exchanged anywhere! ;) ANYWAY, milksharing and wet-nursing has been around since the beginning of time but because of the fear of human contact that society has put on us, both entities have all but disappeared. Milk banks are charging up to $5 per ounce of breast milk. Can you imagine? This makes banked-milk more expensive than formula! I couldn't charge for something that I know can help sustain a life. There are so, so many benefits to breastmilk. I am thrilled that there are so many mamas who are not buckling to the formula companies. (I have had the honor or helping two such mamas). I should say that I did supplement with S1 and S2 and they turned out just fine. However, S3 got no formula at all, and S4 has had no formula either. When you know better, you do better, IMO. If for any reason I need milk for S4, I will be checking Eats on Feets before even thinking about heading to the grocery store.

To be honest, Phantasm gave us an original story, great characters, a perfect villain, and so many surreal, other-worldly moments of out-there imagery and hallucinogenic moments of outright strangeness that to merely watch it is not enough. To see Phantasm is to get caught up in the (nether)world it creates in and of itself.
"An agreement was reached and an addition was built onto the rear of the grocery and made into a tavern. You may note that I refer to one establishment as a tavern and the other as a saloon. This is not accidental. Gelhausen's was a dark, bad place with men sitting around. I do not know why, when beer was again legal, that Grandma always had me go to Gelhausen's when she wanted a pitcher of beer. There was a side door at the rear and a separate tap for take-out. It cost a whole dime for a big pitcher of beer.

I am going to head out of work a bit early today. My first stop will be the gym (I think I will run to Alanis tonight) and then I need to do my weekly grocery shopping. I know there are many people that like grocery shopping, but not me. I used to like it better, but money is soo tight right now. I don't get to pick new things to try...just keep to the essentials. But things will get better...and I know they could be worse.

Finally, the clothing you wear to bed can affect the quality of sleep you have. Rough fabrics or heavy material can cause irritation that makes it difficult to fall and remain asleep. Wearing fabrics that are comfortable can cure this. One such fabric is nylon. Nylon Nightgowns are light and breathable. They allow free movement and do not hinder natural sleep positions.

''The concern that the Coalition has is that there's an enormous power imbalance in the supply chain, between the big supermarkets and smaller suppliers and where that market dominance is detrimental to suppliers in the longer term, consumers will also be disadvantaged.'' To say there's an "enormous power imbalance in the supply chain" is just the most extraordinarily wild understatement, but it's hard to imagine the Liberal Party actually doing anything about the situation even if they were in government because of their business-friendly attitude and their economic-libertarian tendencies. The National Party would huff and puff but in the end the views of the larger partner in the Coalition would win out. The Labor Party is unlikely to do anything because if it did it would be blamed for any price increases felt by consumers. It would fall to the Greens to support the agricultural sector in Australia, but they are unlikely to lead a majority government for the forseeable future. In coalition with Labor their views would also be smothered. But what can government do, anyway. Probably not much.
Dorado Films' DVD features a solid 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer from a reasonably decent source print. There's a little bit of dirt and print damage evident, and some very minor color shifting issues, but otherwise, it's quite stable, with solid contrasts, good detail, and no obvious cuts or missing frames. Audio is English 2.0.
How amazing that a catchy little ditty like this could land such a punch? It speaks directly about getting wasted and its shitty consequences, but can't seem to decide if it's worth it or not. In one line, booze is the cause of misery and isolation, at another the singer proudly announces he and booze get on just fine. This is an alcoholic's theme song if there ever was one.

The past year especially has been a time that God has brought a slew of new friends and contacts into our life and it’s almost like He knows what He is doing. I find it ironic that I didn’t realize that it was Ash Wednesday until the restlessness inside of us got so intense that we made the decision this morning that today was the day we were going to make some drastic changes and start to simplify. Now, don’t judge us because what is drastic to us might be commonplace to you…nevertheless, we know we are about to get our butt kicked with an early spiritual, emotional and physical spring-cleaning of sorts. God needed us in this place and has worked on us for over two years using authors, friends, family, pastors and leadership.
The fact is that CO2 is not a pollutant. CO2 is a colorless and odorless gas, exhaled at high concentrations by each of us, and a key component of the biosphere's life cycle. Plants do so much better with more CO2 that greenhouse operators often increase the CO2 concentrations by factors of three or four to get better growth. This is no surprise since plants and animals evolved when CO2 concentrations were about 10 times larger than they are today. Better plant varieties, chemical fertilizers and agricultural management contributed to the great increase in agricultural yields of the past century, but part of the increase almost certainly came from additional CO2 in the atmosphere."
4:48pm. On the train. Lego houses scattered across the altiplano. Mini-golf mountains undulated along the panorama’s outermost border, illuminated bronze and ash orange as the sun began its dip behind the horizon.

Happy Spring!! Ok, so I know that Spring is technically NOT here until the 21st, but when North Dakota is getting RAIN instead of SNOW and ABOVE freezing temps, it calls for a celebration!! The 21st marks the first day of Spring, and I will be having another jewelry party on the 26th!! I'm looking forward to bringing out some of my new *SPRING Collection* and then....if I don't sell everything....putting it online! ;-D I believe we're all ready for the birds to fly home, delicate buds to bloom, and the gentle smells of the earth being awoken again after a long, cold Winter.

After the co-op, we head home. Bram has some nursing while R puts together sandwiches and huge salads for lunch. After lunch, I clear the dishes while R and Bram begin some floor time. Bram’s gotten so good at rolling over and grabbing his toys. He’s started to vocalize a lot more now, and we really feel like he’s grasping the baby signs that we’re teaching him. It seems like we’re on the verge of some big “firsts.” The three of us enjoy stories, toys, kisses, and songs together. When we can tell that he’s getting sleepy, we head outside. Bram has gotten comfortable taking his long afternoon nap in the stroller, so R pushes him all around while I go for my run. We’re out and about for well over an hour. The weather is beyond perfect. We see so many of our neighborhood friends playing with their families, as well. Life is good.
**edit** This post isn't particularly about winter, or summer, it was just an example I had floating around in my head. I just wanted to share that negativity abounds, and recently I've heard more and more of it specifically about winter. But there are a lot of things I try to change my perspective on: cranky holiday shoppers, cashiers who look oh-so hateful, someone else's tension & negativity over a looming deadline, those "toxic" personalities who can't say one good thing at the office. I always try to find something to point out in each of these situations to help change the perspective to a brigher note. I'm not always successful. **end edit**
The second course of Salmon and Fried Egg Sauce was also beautiful - and here you can see much more Japanese influence: a gorgeous slab of lush salmon, cooked and cured in lime juice and vanilla bean, sat on top of nori puree (that also contains caviar powder, Marcel remembers at the last minute), fried egg sauce with pickled daikon in the shape of cherry blossoms, with compressed kumquat and compressed radish for textural contrast and lovely bursts of tart/bitter to counterbalance the savory/sweet/sour of the other ingredients. And some micro basil and coriander flowers for garnish to evoke the spring.

Mercy has changed a lot over the course of the series, and it really shows in River Marked. I love how she's changed, through her relationships with Adam, the pack and her other friends like Stefan, and also by the events she's been through. River Marked shows us a more emotional side of her than we've really seen before, and also shows the strength of her relationship with Adam. And while we don't see too much of the rest of the beloved side characters, they still have some little developments going on in the back ground. I'd be very surprised if Stefan doesn't end up playing a more central role in the next book with some of the snippets we have here.
You may not be able to thank God for losing your job, but certainly even when you have lost your job you can still thank God in that situation. Why?

And no I do not want to turn you into a mush or push over….In business as in life I need you strong, positive and well rested so that you can take on anything or anyone!

My overall point of quoting the above critics is to perhaps convey how being high up in the press circle might make BRONSON more opaque, which is a sad thing to have to say, especially about ROLLING STONE magazine which, as I dimly recall, used to have its finger at least in the same town as the counterculture's pulse. A sleek, younger journal like SLANT nails it beautifully however in this piece of knowing, liquid mercury prose from Nick Schager:

Insomnia – Insomnia is something that started around my first pregnancy as well. I think it started with bad sleeping habits after my oldest was born. Instead of tending to his needs and returning to bed, I would stay up, smoke, watch television and eat. As I continued these habits, my sleeping routine became nonexistent. However, as I was doing this, I didn’t really realize what I doing to myself. I have spent the past decade and half taking sleeping meds off an on, both prescription and over the counter. In 2004 I was even put on Seroquel for insomnia! That is a medication used for schizophrenics! It worked well for about a year but after that I began suffering terrible nightmares and took myself off it. Now that my diet has been changed, I’m off sugar and have only one cup of caffeine in the morning, along with increased activity level during every day, I’m starting to sleep much better now.

In fact I carry my camera with me so often that in some department stores have asked me to keep my camera in my bag or leave the store. *Sheepish grin* (In addition I suggest never to make a scene in a store. It is not good for your business nor theirs and may even destroy possible future business relations.)

It has taken me a couple of days to figure out why bin Laden's death is so strange for me. I think it has something to do with the way we have come to accept death so easily in our society, as a logical outcome of various battles between good and evil all over the globe. And I think it has much to do with what that acceptance says about us as a species and us as a society.

To unschool is to live. That’s it plain and simple. It’s to feel the fire in the belly and your mind explode; it’s to sit in the living room on a snowy night with a cup of tea while reading your favourite book until wee hours in the morning. It’s to wake up at 5 am to watch the sun rise and then go back to bed. It’s having that stranger sitting beside you become your best friend for the next hour. It’s going on a crazy adventure to listen to your favourite author talk in the next city. It’s volunteering at the art gallery or anarchist bookstore. Its life: anything you want it to be.

Pete and I not only share the addiction of writing and love of the printed word, but we both submitted our books in the James Twyman competition (ongoing) to find the ‘next top spiritual author’. It appeared to us separately and together that the contest had to walk a fine line between maintaining energy levels required to bring a thousand authors into the fold – via a series of ’rounds’ – and the competitive nature of eliminating 99 percent of them. We have both completed round one (voting round), but as of today await confirmation whether or not our books have made it over the first hurdle: enough votes!

It's a rather expensive one-day read, but it's a book you want on your shelf, if for no other reason than as a memorial of the lost Jewish children featured. Only a handful of the artists and poets in this book actually survived to liberation in 1945. Sadly, the rest either died in Terezin or were murdered in Auschwitz.

Details. Interpretation. Make it your own. This painting could take place at any time you wish. This could be 1400AD Japan. Back then, maybe it was custom to hold a stern face (instead of smile) in appreciation of an appealing opposite sex individual? Maybe owning a pitchfork placed you as an elite of the times. A British couple visiting the Land of the Sun. Make your own stories. Have fun with it. Imagination. Who’s to say those ‘art historians’ are always right?
Fred had missed all the downsizing because of a fortuitous decision to take a walk. The soothsayers no longer wished to own a caravan. Upon realizing this Fred strolled over to the east side of his mountain summit. Normally this valley would be bound by fog and nothing would be seen. However, on this cold clear day all could be observed. As he gazed downward into the eastern valley he saw the kingdom of the Count of Computing. This kingdom, from where Fred could view it, was neat and organized methodically.
So we threw a medieval banquet in the bookshop.

I used the wear red stamp from the Darkroom Door 1920s Chic set and attached it wth an eyelet and added some thread. The post mark stamp is is from the Tim Holtz French Marketplace set. The rose was made using the Mini Tattered Florals die and I used my Melting Pot to coat it with UTEE. The ribbon and lace are from my stash and I dyed the lace using Black Soot DI which I pressed onto my craft sheet then spritzed with water and dipped the lace into it.

The music of the spheres includes all objects in relation to each to other. That great tanda was a whole universe orchestrated together in that moment. It was "the music of the spheres." Perhaps we should not discount ideas that Plato so readily believed. Perhaps this early cosmological theories that entwined astrology, mathematics and music should not have been so fully discounted.

Or maybe taking a cocktail approach to non-alcoholic drinks would make some juices more interesting.

Joe Woods of Poetry Ireland gave each poet the briefest of introductions, leaving their own voices to do the talking. Andrew Caldicott kicked things off. A former Dub, now well settled in Wexford, I became familiar with his work a few years back from the mutually encouraging ambience of the Poetry Ireland forum (a resource which seems to have unfortunately lost some of its brio of late). Andrew's work is considered, crafted and concerned with the shadows of history, travel and family. He read a body of warm, poignant poems, sourced from the soul, but with their feet firmly in the physical world.

OK, back to the skirts. A flirty, figure-hugging skirt that shows a little leg will give you back your feminine curves without sacrificing comfort. For today's outfit I chose my swingiest, most comfortable A-line top as a starting point to illustrate what I mean. The skirt I selected to counteract the loose-fitting top was this pencil skirt, which hugs my hips and does wonders for my bum. Though my actual hips aren't visible under the long top, the line of the skirt continues to taper where it emerges beneath the top's hem, which hints at the shape that's going on underneath. Sure, if you're 21 years old you can just throw on a micro miniskirt and you're done, but the over 30 crowd needs to be a little more subtle in our approach. So what you're looking for are skirts that suggest your shape without suggesting too much else.
So what does Jesus mean here? Well he means that there are many people, even righteous people, who will encounter the truth but either because of their own limited understanding or blatant ignorance, or perhaps simply because the time for them to understand the concept is yet to come, will come into the truth, which is the word of God, and not understand it. This passage also shows one of the reasons much of the Bible was written by the disciples, because they understood a good deal about Christ and the truth that the common man didn’t. To shorten things up a bit, everything in the bible is truth and is put in the bible for a reason, including the passages in the old testament that seem to be illogical at a glance. As for the pi issue, did you read all of the website or just skim it? Considering this also happened in several other comments above this one I think you skimmed it. When the writer of the article you were reading said “God revealed that pi is in fact 3, and we should alter our scientific usage of this ratio accordingly.” he wasn’t listing his opinion. He was listing a popular solution that some people have come up with to make sense of the passage in Kings. If you read past that part he goes on to give a rebuttal to that proposed solution. “Ow, for crying out loud! Read Romans 1:20, 1 Cor 2:10, 1 Thess 1:25, “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good,” 2 Tim 2:7, “…the Lord will give you understanding in everything.”
My friend and Fort Lauderdale artist, Nolan Haan, is at it again! If you recall, Nolan paints theses amazing pieces of cinderblock walls....on silk!! Now, he's forayed into talking photos of what he calls "unintended abstractions." I'm in love with the composition, texture, and colors that he captures in his photographs. These would look so amazing blown up, printed on metal, and hung in a loft somewhere in the city.
This is a fan video, and bravo to whomever made it! It definitely whets the appetite for more videos and fan-based art….and, of course, Outlander books. (Last time I checked, the conclusion’s in the making.)

Three drizzly, cooped-up days passed that left Izzy and Hen with nothing to do but help unpack boxes. The worst part was that all but five of Izzy’s precious books were travelling by flat-rate post, and wouldn’t arrive for at least another week. She read and reread those five until she had memorized every sentence. Just when the boredom reached a level that made her think she’d rather go to school than spend another day with nothing happening – something

In the first online freelance writing company I signed up for, I was victimized by fraud as the virtual company refused to pay for my compositions. I realized that there are such scams out there so I learned to research first before I signed up for another one. The next I got, I’m still writing for up to now. It’s just that the pay here is so excruciatingly low that everytime I submit an essay I felt like a beggar asking for a small piece of bread. Especially when I learned that they are earning big time with what I write from the prices they offer in their website. Bastards!

My middle name is Lynn. Vickie Lynn. I was adopted at birth and my mom told me that the name Deborah Lee was my name at birth. Debbie. I was always confused as a Debbie or a Cindy growing up. I don’t know why. I had a common face. A common Debbie or Cindy face. My mom went on to tell me that she called me Vickie Lynn because she had a baby doll when she was little named Vickie Lynn. Seriously, a baby doll named Vickie Lynn? What the hell was wrong with her?

I called upon fellow bikers, similarly in a woozy haze, a possy to take on the otherwise slovenly day. Greg and I set forth first, he upon Billy’s steed, a 70 dollar Walmart hardtail with few redeeming virtues beyond its postmodern interpretation of brakes, and I upon my muddy specialized crossroads, fresh off my worst day of riding yet: this will remain an untold saga, but suffice it to say there was an absurd amount of frustrated ululations, imprecations, and masculine dominance rituals directed at the bike that usually left the bike firmly lodged in the bushes. The last straw was running into the only blasted holly tree in greater Great Falls region. I went home and promptly bought a helmet. Anyways, the bike was muddy and worn. I’m starting to get more and more stares when I’m cruising the streets not, as I hoped, because of the level of sexiness I feel whipping through DC, but more likely it is the deplorable state of my bike. It’s the same way people stare at you when you are walking around with a King Charles Cavalier in your arms: cold looks of “why do you own that thing.”

Benjamin Franklin argued that the social contract/constitution should be renewed every generation. Is now not the time to do this? But how? We can’t vote them out. By them I mean the career politicians, those who are indistinguishable but for their tie colour. We have no real democracy. The Diceyan concept of Parliamentary sovereignty is now defunct. Parliament is self serving, its mandate is hollow and built on lies. It is time to put something above the cretins that milk their expenses, a code of conduct that is binding on everything they do – a codified constitution. By demanding that we change the method and form of our government we create the ‘event’ that the foundation of most constitutions spring from. In the way that Americans look to their founding fathers for inspiration, we should look to the Levellers, not the Glorious Revolution or Cromwell. We must change Hart’s rule of recognition to something we recognise and we re-write the contract. As I have said, we can’t vote them out. Turkeys won’t vote for Christmas (hackneyed, I know). I’m not advocating an uprising, more mass demonstrations, less velvet more cashmere or tweed.

Moorside school in North Halifax today welcomed unbeaten Halifax professional boxers, Liam Walsh and Scott Gladwin for a charity fundraiser for Marie Curie. Both boxers live in North Halifax and put their unbeaten records on the line when they fight at North Bridge leisure centre on Saturday April 14. The kids were really excited about todays event and after a pad demonstration involving Liam and Scott the kids were invited to do pad work and then spar with the pro's. The pep talk from Liam about discipline and dedication in the sport of boxing was very well recieved and maybe, we may have some future champions in the making.

The Deep Tissue Massager comes with four interchangeable attachments: deep muscle, four finger flex, accupoint, and raised bump. My favorite is the deep muscle one, but they are all useful for different areas of your back or different aches and pains you are working on. It also has a variable speed feature to adjust the intensity, which was nice because the higher speed was a little too harsh around areas like my shoulder blades and spine, but worked great for getting at areas that usually need a little more work to feel relaxed. It is powered with a cord so you don't need to worry about getting new batteries all the time and the cord is nice and long too, so you won't need to be in an uncomfortable spot just to be next to an outlet. It is very easy to use and my kids have been having a blast giving massages to each other and me.

And I thought I'd successfully put the kibosh on any more of the white stuff falling by getting Jas fitted out with proper, sensible (i.e. German) winter boots* and ordering myself some equally sensible (although not German**) winter boots to try and keep me upright in the slippy conditions (so far I've landed on my rump twice - am now avoiding that particular spot).
Other times, though, people borrow or construct arguments against different than/to. These include analogical arguments (“You can’t say different than because you can’t say differs than”: this paraphrases Strunk and White) and pseudo-logical arguments (“Than can only follow comparative adjectives or adverbs like whiter or faster”; “You can’t say different to because to means moving together”). An extreme example of this misapplication of logic is to be found in the frothy fulminations of the Queen’s English Society:

Sources claim that John McCabe of McCabe Builders and Anglo Golden Circle fame has contracted to sell a site at 11-15 Arlington Street in St James’s in London SW1A 1RD for in excess of GBP 20m (€23m). The site believed to be this one described on the McCabe UK website has planning permission for up to 14 apartments but it is understood that the present intention is to develop seven apartments, each with a gross internal area of 2,000 sq ft. The relevant planning application is understood to be 00/02615/FULL available here. Apartments are fetching in excess of GBP 4,000 per square foot in Mayfair at present but Arlington Street, a stone’s throw from the Ritz hotel, would be considered a less valuable secondary location within London’s borough of the City of Westminster; the speculation is that these seven apartments would fetch GBP 2,500 psf or GBP 5m a pop. The buyer has not yet been revealed. It is understood that McCabe is selling the property under NAMA’s auspices.

Spanning four decades, from 1968 onwards, this is the story of a fabulous but flawed family and the slew of ordinary and extraordinary incidents that shape their everyday lives. It is a story about childhood and growing up, loss of innocence, eccentricity, familial ties and friendships, love and life. Stripped down to its bare bones, it''s about the unbreakable bond between a brother and sister.
Before then I heard one or two songs but not really paid them much attention but the second I started the album (Fourteen Autumns and Fifteen Winters) it all fell into place. The opening number (Cold Days From The Birdhouse) started up really quietly but I knew something great was coming. The second I heard the vocals I knew I'd made the right choice. Predictably the song exploded into noise and although I knew it was coming it made me smile so much and still does every time - it's that good.
However, subconscious racism can extend into any number of areas of one's life, including, it seems one's sexual preferences. Within the last year, on an internet forum I was accused of sexual racism when I stated that I have never felt sexually or romantically attracted to a non white male. To some, such as him, it would appear any number of sexual eccentricities are acceptable, provided that they are multicultural.

At the same time, my level of physical activity has accelerated quite a bit. As I'm spending more time in my body than my head, really listening to it, I hear that it wants to move and work, for the sheer joy of it. I have taken up running with a zest I didn't know was possible. For most of my life, physical activity was something I thought about doing, felt like I should be doing, but didn't actually want to do. Now I look forward to it, and find myself having to temper my enthusiasm so I don't OVERdo it. I've also been working in the yard, gardening. I planted pumpkins, and they sprouted! My arms are sore today from pulling up weeds. There is an incredible level of satisfaction in all of this.
I started with a base of brown bazzill and layered with white (pierced) and then a piece of Hey Birdie DSP.

I cut it out with small oval nesties (and added a little sponging), matted with Rose Red and some lighter pink bazzill. Finished by adding a small cream prima (thanks to my friend Michelle), a Kaisercraft pink rhinestone and of course a cream bow!! :)

Under the proposed legislation, Ottawa would concentrate its effort on environmental assessments of “major economic projects,” according to background information obtained by The Globe and Mail. Provinces will set their own level of oversight for smaller projects. It was unclear how federal and provincial governments will determine which projects require federal assessment and which require only provincial consideration, though those that cross provincial boundaries will remain federal matters. Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, who leads a province that has seen a boom in mining and other resource extraction projects in recent years, said the new policy would eliminate unnecessary duplication between federal and provincial regulation efforts. …
A quick scan reveals that Japanese cinema is particularly abundant. There are a dozen films by Mizoguchi (most on HD) including The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum, The Life of Oharu, Utamaro and his Five Women, and The 47 Ronin; 17 by Ozu (more than half on HD); 9 by Oshima (nearly all on HD); and over a dozen by Naruse. Suzuki, Imamura, Shimizu and Teshigahara are also represented. And Kurosawa is the most generously available of all, with around 25 titles.
I once did a brief stint at a publishing house concerned primarily with the cookery, beauty and gardening type of paper-wasting exercises. I used to get dizzy just looking at the mercantile florescent sleeves and cover-jackets, and often found myself in the backroom sorting through old, discarded and out of print copies where I chanced upon a number of poetry collections published in the 1990s. One of them, now sitting beside me as I write this, was that of W.B. Yeats. I learned a lot about Yeats while reading other poets, who always and unanimously hailed him as a polyhistor and the laureate of modern romance. In turn, I felt I couldn’t read him for fear of being disappointed, but when I chanced upon his selected poems in an Oxfam in Islington my curiosity got the better of me.

Read: Yesterday I read a survey done by The Jenkins Group, an independent publishing services firm, that shows millions of Americans never read another book after leaving school. It also said 80% of U.S. families did not buy or read a book last year. I find this tragic. I believe reading makes for well rounded people, who are less egocentric and able to empathize with the plight of others. They read stories about other people, become educated about situations in their community and around the world, get out of their own heads and into the head of a character in a story. Reading broadens worldviews, allows opinions to grow and evolve and inspires action and creativity. Plus, it's fun.

Also, the use of the number “seven” to describe the quantity of components is a little misleading. If you count the three different cheeses as separate entities, what you’re actually getting is a ten-layer burrito. One could even make the argument that the tortilla itself should count as a layer, bringing the constituent total to eleven. Why, then, is it not named after a larger and presumably more desirable number?

I googled it when I got home and discovered that it is usually sold through high-end department stores (Marni?) and probably cost $200 new. I got it for $15 and it is pristine. I like it so much that I have a little crush on it.

Last year, the team failed miserably in clutch situations, while this year, it seems like they do their best work after the first two men have been retired in an inning.

New York’s 167 runs scored with two outs rank second in the league to the Phillies’ 168. However, the Phillies have played 88 games, while the Mets have played 87.

I liked this novel, especially as Riley actually learns from her mistakes this time. Riley tends to have a chip on her shoulder and an extremely low self-esteem, but refuses to listen to anyone around her when they try to help. This time, she learns to trust others and actually listen to them, and I liked that she grew up a little—her bratty attitude is toned down a lot in the novel, which was a major plus, making me enjoy her character a whole lot more than in previous novels.

Once we arrived in Chicago, we got some deep dish pizza (can you go to Chicago without doing that?), checked into the hotel, and grabbed a few hours of sleep. I wasn't nervous at all, surprisingly. The next morning we woke up early, around 5:30, and headed to the hospital. We found the parking garage right away, and note: you do have to pay to park. Which...am I just small town spoiled? Paying to park at a hospital? Valet is actually cheaper, so I recommend that, and obviously that has the advantage of delivering you right to the door.
However, they DID tell me that I was eligible for a ‘pre-approved’ auto loan to the tune of $30,000, if I wanted to buy a new car!
A brief moment of silence follows and then a new voice comes over the radio, “Sutton here, the Sergeant Major and I are loaded in the deuce and a half. We report that, for the most part, the road way ahead is clear. About a mile east you are going to come to a roadblock manned by some hard cases, mostly armed with bolt and lever action deer rifles and a few semi auto civilian rifles, with a couple of 12 gauge pump shot guns. The Sergeant Major and I convinced them that refusing us passage or attempting to charge us a toll could be hazardous to their health. They have agreed to let us pass, but I would be on the lookout for a double cross if they think they might obtain an advantage. Rangers lead the way, Sutton out.”
Splendidly, CHRISTMAS VACATION doesn’t force any idyllic finish – Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) kidnaps Clark’s boss (Brian Doyle Murray), who realizes what a cheap prick he was by refusing to give out Christmas bonuses, the SWAT teams breaks into the house, Uncle Lewis lights a stogie, igniting the toxic sewage and blasting a plastic Santa Claus into the sky as Aunt Bethany leads them in a chorus of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

I began to suspect this long ago when my Bharatanatyam teachers had trouble pinning down provenances and answering questions about origins. Given the Indian high esteem for ancient-ness (older the better), this was inconsistent. Being able to cite one's lineage and origin is, almost literally, everything.

One big but unannounced (and possibly inadvertent) change is in the detail of the wording: what was a constitution now becomes just guidelines. This is a potential nightmare: under these proposals the BFS committee will lose the ability to vote for changes to the procedure, but since the rules will now be just guidelines, the administrator can make up new rules on the fly as they need them, as long as they don’t actually add them to the formal rules. So we’ll end up with the awards being run on a series of unwritten and informal – and thus inconsistent and unaccountable – rules. I’ve seen that happen in the past, and it wasn't pretty.
God, who is holy and perfect, presents the Standard to which none of us could measure up. Evidence of our sin and guilt is apparent when held up to the light of His holiness and righteousness. We have no righteousness in front of Him. Because of our sin and guilt, a sentence has to be served. Someone had to pay for the wrongs that we have done.

There’s no 3D time here where I am, and it’s difficult for me to give you or my partner messages that are synchronistic to the reality you live in. Instead, we often give you information about the energies and the potentials that are here and not something on your timeline. So that is what this particular message is about.
I love this series. Our hero, John Taylor is forced to go back to the Nightside, when a young girl is missing. Nightside is the deep, magical heart of London filled with otherworldly creatures, gods, angels, demons, maniacs with shotguns, immortals and where reality is ever-changing and magic abounds. There are so many bizarre characters, some you come to like, some you hate and some you run away from. The Nightside series take pulp fiction an extra step & meld it to the supernatural and the weird sci-fi realm. No matter the scope of danger, Taylor finds himself in the middle of it, and in the end, no one messes with John Taylor, though some have tried.
The New Statesman’s exclusive George Galloway’s conversion to Islam seems to have quite a few people upset, not least Gorgeous George himself. But is it a big deal? Why do people care? And what does it have to do with his ability to serve Bradford? In my opinion, nothing. So why are people so bothered about his alleged conversion?
We see this particularly at the beginning of 1 Kings. After describing in chapters 1-3 the brief, but bloody, power-struggle that led to Solomon’s establishment on the throne of David, the next two chapters stress two crucial features of his reign: the peace and prosperity that accompanied it, and the source and greatness of his wisdom.
So, in the next few weeks I will be preparing to make a move to the store and out of my garage...I . Am. So. Excited. I can hardly stand it!
It’s no secret that I’m a stubborn bitch. I’m a Taurus so I’m very bullheaded. When I’m right I’m right. You have to PROVE me wrong. Sure I know I need to be compromising in a relationship, & I am (I think?). But you need to be compromising too. If you’re really bullheaded then we’re going to clash. A lot.

There are times when certain segments of the American population really disgust me. I am sure everyone has seen this absurd brouhaha over the show ‘All American Muslim‘ and how a passel of ignorant, inbred hicks in Florida pressured big name companies to drop their advertising because Muslims were not being prtrayed as murderous terrorists. Fine. If people want to scream ‘freedom of speech’ till the cows come home, go right ahead. You can go declare to the world what a hateful, intolerant bigot you are, and I ALSO have the right to think you’re a bunch of small-minded morons. Oh, and I can say that too, because it’s MY freedom of speech.

I am also scared and quite tense, but I have great confidence in my trainer, and her skill to help me relax, and I have watched him being ridden by her often, and he looks so happy and unstressed that I know I can continue to develop my confidence with him as well! He is such a terrific horse, he has such try and an honest work ethic. My love for him is great as well as my love for all my horses!

I don’t know why certain anniversaries loom so large in our lives, but for whatever reason, the anniversaries of grief are immense. At the beginning of my grief over the death of my life mate/soul mate, a minister friend told me that always on the anniversary, even if I’m not consciously aware of the date, I will feel an upsurge of grief. This is only my second anniversary, with perhaps dozens still to come, but I can already see the truth of his words. Grief comes from somewhere deep within, somewhere deeper than thought, somewhere deeper than volition. And it keeps track of time.

Elvis effortlessly exploded nationally on television in 1956 on the Dorsey Brothers Stage show, in glorious live black and white while merging the black and white cultures in one song delivered with a religiously fervored sexuality and The King returned in an riot of colour, leather and sweat, wringing everything from his soul to earn back that national and even global acclaim.
“Why? Most leaders have not experienced an organizational culture that requires values alignment as well as high performance. Without relevant role models or “on the job” training for managing values AND performance, organizational leaders don’t know what to “do differently” to do those things effectively.
I believe that the people who understand the most about group dynamics aren’t the ones who do the most talking. The silent ones are essentially outsiders, and as such we can better observe the finer points. This outsider views most groups as embarrassingly bad theatrical performances in which the same players perform the same painfully shallow roles before the same silent and unexpressive audiences, sometimes for years. Whatever good I possess—and I see this as being true of most people—isn’t likely to appear in the context of a discussion group.
The hair is clearly out of control, and I truly don't know what to do with it, so, I present you with this question:

For me it’s a sign of Büchner’s genius that the play manages to convey so much on so many levels. Yes, it’s about a struggle of political ideas and practices, but there is also the psychological struggle between the main protagonists, intensely played out at points.
It seemed that as I was driving home from work, at peak hour of course, whichever direction I went there was no way to go around it. I had heard this much from the radio’s traffic report: left (accident), right (accident), forwards (lots of traffic, and another eventual accident awaiting closer to home), and backwards was a no through road.

In the past, I have made some pleated purses, homemade candy, crocheted scarves, clothes, I can't remember but a variety of things. This year I actually started a box of stuff that I come across or make for the auction. When it is done, I put it in the box. That way I won't have to remember where I put it all. This year I am making freezer paper tshirts, a table runner with appliques, a bag, and a few other things. I will post pictures after I get them all done. So far I have one tshirt done. It is really fun for the kids. In fact I think they like it the most. Every year we have raised about 400-500 dollars. That pays for our camping sites and part of the food. It works out for everyone I think.

A local radio station, like all local radio stations, sees fit to offer us the latest news in the area whenever it rears its ugly head. Where I live it may as well be the head of a Gorgon, because it seems there’s not a week goes by* where someone hasn’t emptied a gun into his wife or killed a baby with his truck. The latter happened this week, and as ever, Real Radio North East not only posted the story on their website but also linked to it on every social network they can be bothered with, including Facebook.

Among all the activities carried out by Michelangelo Buonarroti (architect, painter, sculptor, writer and humanist), he preferd being a sculptor.

This Kat was looking forward to a more rigorous discussion of the meaning of 'communicating the work in public' in s 107(2A). She notes that the Copyright and Trade Mark Enforcement Notebook for Trading Standards Officers prepared by the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT, whose self-stated 'primary purpose is to protect the United Kingdom’s film and broadcasting industry'), available here on the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO), website states (at 8) that:

For instance, you can begin by sheltering your finances from predictable market developments, reducing exposure or totally diversifying out of de-stabilizing markets like real estate, commercial commodities, and most stocks. Instead of being unpleasantly surprised, benefit from those same predictable market developments. For those that would benefit from it, shelter your finances from the default exposure to tax and court liability by using the most conservative protections built in to those systems. For those valuing debt relief, explore conservative negotiation options, perhaps including the possibility of filing bankruptcy- not as an imperative, but as a precaution- and just explore it. (By the way, as I have been explicitly telling folks for years, as the lending markets further de-stabilize, having a good credit score may not matter as much when there are “suddenly and surprisingly” not any lenders left to lend.)

This is Mussolini's famous prophecy about the 20th century in the Enciclopedia Italiana. It came true with the aid of the modern-day Left and their love of big government. To underline that, note that in 1900 the ratio of government spending to GDP in Italy was 10%, in the 1950s 30%, and it is now roughly 60% (Martino, 1998). In this prophecy, Mussolini rejected Marxian socialism because he disliked the Marxist notions of class war and historical inevitability but modern-day Leftists differentiate themselves from Marxists too.

It’s also noticeable that many of the people who come in to watch the football are never seen in the pub at any other time of the week. Pubs might be pleasantly surprised by the amount of business generated if they made a positive virtue of not having Sky rather than simply keeping quiet about it.
They became best buddies. They have seen one another every Tuesday night and Sunday afternoon since they were a few months old. Their bond is much like most cousin's. They are fist fighting one minute, and hugging the next. They are the duo we all love to be around, and everything they say and do is funny. Except when they are breaking glass candle holders and trying to chew on the pieces. True story.

It didn’t hurt that the book within the cover was fantastic. (And has an awe-inspiring twist partway through.) And then I waited for Harkaway to publish another book. And waited. And waited. Sure, he’d occasionally mention on Twitter that he was working on something, but his Tweets (though enjoyable) were no substitute for a second book. And then, finally: Angelmaker. And I was not disappointed.
Stay tuned....more pictures tomorrow.

The other challenge that I kept coming back to was celebrate the occasion. Which was use green, white and one other color for any occasion. So my sneakers are green, white and blue. I keep thinking I should change the occasion to sneaking by to say hi, or something like that.
This has the feel of an app that's been rushed out to establish the pair's undoubted authority on the subject rather than creating something that would be really useful to the consumer. There's some great advice and some interesting suggestions for wine pairings I hadn't thought of such as cloth-bound cheddar with a mature sparkling red and Gorgonzola and red Lambrusco - just not quite enough of it.
Stamps: Noble Deer, Sentiment from Hero Arts
There was a storm named Katrina, and people started teasing Katrina about it. One day, my classmates and I were on the school’s old-fashioned swing. It was a Patio Glider Swing made of metal. It had two benches facing each other, a roof over it, and a connecting floor. Katrina got on the swing and an idea hit me. I stood in the middle of the swing and rocked the swing saying “Ahhhhh nandito na si Katrina! Binabagyo na tayooo!”[3] My classmates started laughing. I kept doing this until Katrina left. Other people started doing this every time Katrina got on the swing with them. Okay, I don’t really remember if I actually started all of this. Maybe I didn’t. Maybe I saw someone else do it. But I remember doing it, and I remember other people doing it too, and of course it was immature and mean, but when I was young I thought it was a justified punishment for demoting Raisa to a horse.

From the fan’s point of view the outcome of the draft is going to be the future of your franchise and many dedicated fans, like myself, invest lots of time scouting, reading draft guides as well as being glued to ESPN and NFL Network everyday until the draft. The draft makes or breaks their team’s outcomes in later years. Thus, bringing an extremely high excitement factor to it, not only to the fans but to the personal that work so hard for their team. Many general managers either make or break their jobs over the NFL Draft, if you are a GM and have two or three bad years of drafting prospects and evaluating talent then you are more than likely to be let go.
It’s no accident that both Moneyball and The Blind Side were made into highly successful Hollywood movies, which performed well even in countries where few people follow American sport. The storylines, the characters, the ideas, are so strong that you’re drawn into a field you might never otherwise have explored. Despite yourself, you discover that you care.

The rainy season has been in full swing during the past few months, but this does not stop us from escaping onto the river every Sunday for our dose of Nature's sanity. Rain and thunderstorms are not a problem for us, as the riverine trees provide natural umbrellas along the riverbank - here we shelter, and enjoy the effects of sheets of warm rain on the surface of the water.

It feels very strange to be back! I almost don't want to believe that all the dust may be settling for fear that some new major event will occur! Here's a quick rundown of the last month in no particular order:
When I was somewhere between six and eight, I was gifted with having to deal with a very tough Father. My Dad was a Marine, MP and Police Officer. As you can probably deduce, he was a tough guy with a tough attitude. When it came to learning how to swim, his idea was to dunk me under and scare the living bejesus out of me. I wanted to swim, but at a much slower pace. Nope. His ideas were always better and came in his time, not mine. This wasn’t only for swimming, but also involved everything he “taught” me. Riding a bike, catching a ball and all else was an intense experience where patience was placed on the back-burner in lieu of “flooding” or exposing me in a very serious manner. Needless to say, it didn’t work as I was scared half to death rather than having a good time. Today, the eight-year-old boy is still frightened half to death. He talks to me with anxiety and panic attacks. It’s up to me to harness that little boy and give him re-assurance and love. The present day Shaun is supposed to be in charge and be the adult to the little boy, but I tend to allow the boy to control the situation.
Squeezed between all the articles of anguish, attack, darkness, evil, hatred and strife, there is yet one more section to read. In Healthy Living, you can learn how to do this and that to support a balanced life and to live longer. As an older adult in midlife, I have wondered of late if this is life now, why would I want to live longer?
What’s Wrong with Smoking: It’s a free country

While they will drink water when it’s available, mice can live in a dry habitat, getting all the water they need from the food they eat. In the wild, mice eat seeds, roots, leaves and stems, beetle larvae, caterpillars, cockroaches, and carrion, but they prefer seeds and grain. Although mice can live on crumbs, typically they eat 3 grams of food per day (10-15% of their body weight), or about 8 pounds per year. When human food is available, those foods high in fat, protein, or sugar are often eaten in preference to seeds and grain. Some of their favorite human foods include bacon, chocolate, butter and nuts. Mice are naturally curious, and do not hesitate to sample new foods. They will even eat glue or soap, if the soap contains animal fat.

In my memory box I also have a postcard which she wrote to me from Ireland. On the postcard she wrote: Dear Pauline, I am sending this from Ireland where a number of donkeys are used for carrying light loads. This dear little fellow is taking a rest in the field. Hope you are very well. From D F King. The postcard was sent while she was overseas for an extended trip in 1958, and I’m guessing the Welsh dragon probably dates from that trip too. However the other two treasures may have been from a different trip.

"Here's to the Hunter" could easily have been sung by Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra, each taking a sullen chorus in this sullen, sinister story of an encounter between a drifter and a woman living alone. Not that it would've been a hit, but it would've been a respectable album tack, and that would've provided some validation and some royalties.
Therefore, angels are only servants–spirits sent to care for people who will inherit salvation.

This book is mostly set in & around Melbourne, one of the most southern metropolitan city and therefore, due to wind direction, one of the last to die. The story opens on New Year’s Day with the expected TOD (Time of Death) being sometime in September. We follow a number of characters with their own way of coping with this certainty of a messy death within a few months.
One more round of thanks and then I have to go tend to the other tradition-- making a dark chocolate raspberry cake with fresh whipped cream. Parenting-- as I don't have to tell those of you with kids-- is really the most humbling activity in which one can partake. To say I made a few errors along the way is like saying... oh somebody help me here, what's a ridiculous funny analogy? Uh... well it's to say that Springsteen wrote an occasional decent song here and there. The mistakes I made using my patented Error & Error Parenting Technique (TM) could fill many tomes. Along the way so many of you stuck by us, helped me through the first shitty divorce, the second shitty divorce, and many questionable decisions in between. I thank you more than you can ever know.
This film is supposedly a documentary that chronicles a ten-year quest by a professional tracker to determine the migratory habits of Bigfoot and to acquire irrefutable film documentation of their existence. It's actually a collection of nature photography that wasn't quite good enough to make it into the PBS and Mutual of Omaha programs, intermingled with out-of-focus shots of guys in fur-suits and rubber feet.

I am conscious of eating the McDonalds being foolish, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it "wrong" necessarily. It was more of an unfortunate decision. One that I will probably make again in life. Wrong is just too black and white. You might find this analysis tedious and unnecessary but I am believing more and more that this is key to making permanent change. Rooting out these underlying thoughts about my eating behavior, identifying a language and phrases that reinforce the way I want to think about eating - it's important.

First of said conversations was during a basketball game with five of my best friends. We had realized at this point, that these trips are less about basketball and more about just getting away with people that we love. Three of us had left the game and parked at a local watering hole when I brought up the fact that the only challenge that I’m experiencing with college is that I’m only doing it for myself, which doesn’t make much sense to me because I don’t even want it.
Second thought, she’s a natural beauty. She doesn’t need to get ready this early. This girl is fierce, hands on hip fierce.

Ben the Bodyguard is a grizzled, streetsmart Frenchman who knows about the seedy side of things. He has made a living keeping things hidden that need to stay hidden. Ben's most unique biographical tid-bit, however, is that he's an iPhone app.
And God help us all, it's everywhere there is any patriarchy left at all.

I seriously think I have watched this trailer like 100 times, uhhhh. And I re-read the 7th book a few weeks ago, which I have never done...I'm a nerd. Anyway, I just love HP and I CANNOT wait to see the movie, whenever that may be.

I'm utterly hopeless with male themed creations and really struggle to get them just right! Lucky for me we had a fantastic sponsor this fortnight that help me get my mind set on the Challenge!
We are reminded in John 3 that “The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can’t tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can’t explain how people are born of the Spirit.” And I share this because we need to remember we cannot command the Holy Spirit to do this or that for us.
I love my cats. I really do. Anyone who knows me will tell you, I put them before me and before a lot of other stuff. I decline overnight invitations for fear they'll be lonely and unfed, I rush back from a day or evening out to make sure they have food and are ok, I nurse them when they are sick and cuddle them when they feel like it.
What I know for sure is that no matter which path I chose, no matter which direction I go, there are people who will always be cheering me on, helping me, walking with me, and lending a hand when it's necessary, whether I know it or not.
And my boys? They’re all excited. They will be coming out for a visit about halfway through. Ty may even try to schedule a gig or two there so they can stay a bit longer. Collin is excited about the beach and Camden can’t wait to ride the Rockin’ Rollercoaster.

S: Erm, ok… So tell me; how did we do with the community leaders?

Sharpton said Martin's parents endured "insults and lies" Monday over reports that their son attacked Zimmerman.
Is God truly sovereign in your life? Do you believe wholeheartedly that knowing and serving Jesus is the more important than anything else? Are you willing, along with the apostle Paul, to voluntarily become a slave of Jesus out of your love for Him?
I had hoped to do this giveaway prior to Christmas. I had hoped to include a fun little interview with the author- one of my oldest and closest friends, Jim McCann. But book tours and holidays have kept Jim a little busy and it just never quite came together.
Taylor said he wasn’t privy to internal Fire Department conversations, but that the ESDC had received assurances that the department could do its job despite the closed bridge. (Hagan further pointed out that the ESDC notice neglected to inform people the bridge would be closed for two years.)
Then I got this funny visual about when I was a little kid (not that I'm that much more mature now) and having a tiff with my younger brother about fighting over some toy. You know, both of our hands on the toy pulling back and forth screaming "Mine!", "No, mine!".
I’m tired of the word games and the moral double standards. Fuck that shit describes my sentiments exactly.
For the tables, I sewed 12 foot long table runners, and we laid them over the top of plastic table covers. I really try to stay away from those things, but because we had so many tables to cover, we needed something very inexpensive...thank goodness for the Dollar Tree:o) For the centerpieces, we had mason jars with pink and green glass beads, with a tea light inside, and twine wrapped around the mouth of the jars. The flower arrangements were in large pink goblets.

The apex predator of this isolated world was Haasts Eagle, the "Tiger of the Sky," a massive airborne meat eater at least triple the weight of the Bald eagle. It was not so much a soaring bird as my local eagles are, the Haasts had a stubbier profile on it's ten foot wing span designed for flapping flight, propelling it through the tight forest canopy at speeds in excess of 50 mph. It's striking power was calculated to be roughly that of a cinder block dropped from an eight storey building. The length of it talons and ferocity of grip was on par with the Bengal tiger. While this bird was thought to be an example of aboriginal mythology by the first European explorers, modern DNA science has rendered ancient Maori cave drawings accurate, a man eating eagle did exist on the New Zealand Archipelago.
