What telephone plan to sign up with, which electrical company would be more advantageous, where to invest the pension money, which school was the best, which family doctor, the lowest interest on the mortgage. And they all affected her little world: what was best and most beneficial for her and her family. Endless decisions to make, and you still never knew if you had made the right ones.

For example, a sister whose motherhouse is in New York reports that the elderly in her order are dispersed in secular nursing homes where access to the sacraments is limited. Many sisters say that it is common in their religious orders for sisters chosen by leadership to give a“reflection” in place of the homily. And they say that strange rituals often replace observances of the Church’s liturgical practices.

Under Operation Fast And Furious, there was no plan or means to track the weapons after their sale. Licensed gun dealers were coerced by the BATFE into making repeated bulk sales, even when they expressed grave concern about the persons buying the weapons, including known felons. Federal cash was provided to the straw purchasers when they did not have their own money.

Leticia Velasquez is the editor of a new book, A Special Mother Is Born, which gathers the inspiring testimonies of parents who were given bad prenatal diagnoses, or found themselves unexpectedly the parents of a child with special needs. Read an interview with Ms. Velasquez here. (Special note - I have never liked the term 'special' mother/parent/person used to describe parents who have children with disabilities. It's just a personal thing for me. I don't feel special. What I do feel is very, very blessed.)

MOM: How many times have you seen this movie?
I had been interning throughout my junior and senior years. My last internship was with CNN’s Showbiz Tonight. I was able to score an interview with CNN for a freelancing PA position, but with the dive in the economy there was a backlog. So, I went on the internet and looked for a job position, even taking a look on Craigslist (small piece of advice: when sending your resume on websites like Craigslist, only list your city and email address; watch out on how much information you give out.) I set a goal that once I graduated I was to submit my resume to five positions a day. It was a bit tedious having to tweak my cover letter almost twenty-five times a week but it was totally worth it!

To illustrate just how much it matters, let’s consider together one of the most famous debates in Christian history. It is a debate that centers on one, tiny little letter. When the early church was working out its orthodox understanding of how God the Father and Christ the Son interact, they introduced a specific term. They said that Christ was homoousios (of the same substance) with God the Father, meaning that they were both, equally, and fully God. But an opposing opinion voiced by the Arian heretics claimed that Christ was not homoousios but homoiousios (of a similar substance)—in other words, that Christ was not God, but very like God. The only difference between the two words (homoousios/homoiousios) is that tiny little ‘i’—called an Iota.

The nose on this is sweet and perfumed with lots of fruit and floral notes. I get pears, rosewater and fruit cocktail. The palate surprises with a dry malt early on cushioned by the perfume which then fades into those syrupy, floral notes that were on the nose and then a quite sweet white grape juice. The finish is a slightly malty rosewater reduction.

I settled on participating in more challenges (like OLW and DCM). The first challenge? Finding another one to play along with, as I don't always manage to make things for the two I already do! How on earth can I drag out enough inspiration to join another?
If you are a person that loves to observe birds near your home or when you travel, Mr. Lovitch has written a book that will put you up to the necessary pointers to become a real birder. He will in a concise way explain to you what’s the best way to approach birding. Step by step the reader learns and at the same time gets the recommendations to be successful when trying to find the bird species that he or she might be seeking to watch. It displays just the pertinent and necessary illustrations and photographs. The text content is clear and highly informative. You’ll find approximately 180 pages of interesting information! This book brings good lessons for new birders!

This high rise apartment complex sits right in the middle of the new TISS campus–because they built it and were able to keep it for over a year despite TISS objections. TISS always owned the land but they were not pro-active enough regarding removing the settlement. After time, they lost the land

Suspiria (Dario Argento, 1977) - "Argento is excellent at using lighting and design to create the film's unsettling tone. He frequently focuses on closeups of the film's women... as they confront the strange events surrounding them. Faces mean a lot to Argento, faces in various contortions of terror and uncertainty, faces with eyes widened in fear and mouths gasping breathlessly. Agento films Suzy with colored lights washing across her face, especially hovering around her eyes, emphasizing her deer-in-headlights stare. It's obvious that he likes exploring the vulnerability of these women."
The PTA request represents a continuation of the program that was partially funded from PPF funds last year. Budget cuts continue to leave no room for art instruction at the school, but the mandate to include such instruction in the curriculum remains. The PTA membership and school leadership have had good results with fundraising and believes strongly in the benefits that the program brings to the environment at the school. The committee’s recommendation is less than last year’s because of the increase in competing requests.

Let me say a few words about each of these.
Paul focuses first on his own conduct among them. He sought to distinguish himself from the other traveling philosophers of his day. He reminds them that, although they had experienced persecution for speaking the gospel, they were bold to share the gospel with them, even though the threat of more persecution was present. He continues by saying that they are not those who seek the praise from man, but God because He is the One ‘who tests our hearts’ (v.4). If God searches their hearts and they are entrusted and approved for the gospel their motives must be pure (1 Cor. 9:16-18; Gal 1:10).
I don’t remember how we came across this idea but we take all of our old vegetables-not moldy gross-just the ones that are wrinkly or brown. We also save our egg shells and throw those in also because they are high in calcium. During the week when we are cutting up veggies for salads or dinner we save the ends and freeze them to use later for soup. Today Drake, my live-in life partner, is putting it all together and cooking it up to make vegetable stock.
The US occupation forces established a boundary between Haiti and the Dominican Republic by taking disputed land from the latter. After the US left in 1934, Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo – in an event known as the Parsley Massacre – ordered his Army to kill Haitians living on the Dominican side of the border. In a "three-day genocidal spree", he murdered between 10,000 and 20,000 Haitians. He then developed a uniquely Dominican policy of racial discrimination, Antihaitianismo ("anti-Haitianism"), targeting the mostly black inhabitants of his neighboring country.
I had a very aggressive fermentation, with foam everywhere, so next time I will use foam control drops. The current plan is to let this sit in primary a month, then transfer to secondary for three months. After that I will keg it and let it stand for a couple more months before bottling and long term storage in the cooler. I'm thinking this should be ready for Thanksgiving 2009 or Christmas.

American brewers are creating many ‘extreme’ brews to celebrate the intoxicating character of hops and playing a game of ‘one up’ to challenge beer perception and ultimately redefining consumers tastes. As a brew advocate and self proclaimed ‘hophead,’ I like finding the harmony in chaos. Any brewer can pitch in loads of hops into their beer, but how does it play with the other ingredients?

There's a sense of delicious chaos that pulses through the script of Julius and Philip Epstein, one that almost no comedy gets as right as this one.

1:40pm. Open eyes. Some force greater than max volume on my iPod brought me back to life. The DVD menu screen’s soundtrack was repeating. It’s decibel level was louder than the actual movie, not sure why. As far as I could tell the obnoxious intro that tried to pack a war’s worth of cinematic anticipation into its 30-second score had been playing over and over and over ever since I consciously went unconscious. I had been awake now about two minutes, which meant it took four soundtrack loops for me to realize the bus driver had abandoned ship to kick dust around with his co-workers outside. We had been left to marinate in bad B-film music. I was rose to shut off the musical Chinese drip torture amazed that this idea had not occurred to anyone else. As I gave cheek to the blank-eyed woman beside me and stepped into the aisle, I was passed by a German girl with a violent determination who had obviously endured more than four soundtrack loops and was now visibly shaken as she barreled toward the front cabin to end the madness. I sat down, curled into a ball, and once again rewound my Podcast to block out the world. “…On the subject of predictability humans and coins are kind of similar….” The whole ridiculous soundtrack situation exemplified an unfortunate characteristic of the Bolivian people: for so many years they’ve contented themselves with so little that it now goes against every grain in their personality to demand a better situation.
When I was a little kid, I'd lie in bed at night and lift my hands up above my face. I could just make out their dark outline, and to be sure they really belonged to me, I'd shake my fingers around and watch them blur in a half-crescent streak. It was reassuring to know that I controlled their motion, that they obeyed what I told them to do -- like I had to convince myself that my hands weren't these totally separate, alien entities.

In a piece of comical and cliched rhetoric last night, George Osborne said, “This is proof that, in the current global situation, Britain cannot waver from dealing with its debts. This is a reality check for anyone who thinks Britain can duck confronting its debts.” OK, I think we’ve got you there George, although if you want to stick in a wake-up call or three, feel free. However, as The Slog and thousands of others predicted from last Spring onwards, there simply is not a big or diversified enough UK private sector to drive an economic recovery for Britain – hence Mervyn King’s latest QE splurge, at a stroke wiping out the total net Coalition spending cuts fivefold.

Get Rihanna to beat Chris Brown back or anyone on behalf of Rihanna then. Chris did not hold placards and try to destroy Rihanna’s career at the concert, also the beating was in private and we do know that in private people can be very different, so to be fair and equitable, the beat-back could be done in private as well. This public attack via placard is unprincipled and has nothing to do with what happened. Attention whoring on the back of Rihanna and Chris Brown’s spat perhaps?

We're doing "fine" here. Considering what is going on around us. When the first big quake hit, around 2:45 in the afternoon on Friday, I ran to Gray's room and grabbed him out of his crib. We've had plenty of earthquakes in the 2.5 years we've been here, but this one was huge. Gabe started crying and calling for me --I got him too and we huddled on the stairs away from windows and light fixtures. The two big boys were walking home from school and came in while the house was still shaking. They thought it was exciting. I yelled at them to "GET BACK OUTSIDE!" because I'd just been told if you're outside, you're supposed to stay outside! I sat on the stairs praying: "Please protect my kids, please protect my kids, please protect my kids..." It seemed to last forever (around 5 minutes I've heard) and then the aftershocks just kept coming and coming. They're still coming.
But, is that really true? In Josh Beckett’s mind, I suspect, he’s worked his butt off at this game. He’s pitched through pain. He’s delivered in big moments. He was the pitching force behind Boston’s World Series. He’s endured the pains of the game -- the slumps, the boos, the insults, the injuries. So he doesn’t want to sit in the dugout every stinking minute of every game … so he wants to take his mind off things on his day off by playing a little golf … so he doesn’t have the talent to entertain reporters and doesn’t feel like making the game look like it’s the most fun he’s ever had in his entire life … so he doesn’t want to perform Seppuku every time the Red Sox lose a game …

“It is striking that the very first word of the entire book of Psalms should be this one. Surely it is far more important (this is the second question) that we should be righteous, or obedient, or loving, than that we should be merely happy? Yes, in the short; but from his original creating of his people right through to his final redeeming of them, Scripture is clear that God’s long-term purpose for them is that they should be blessed. The psalmists celebrate every foretaste of that heavenly promise.” (20)

There is no question that this book is violent, violent, violent. The characters live in a world that breeds violence and they are forced to play the game. This book works because it is so relevant to the issues that young people see plaguing their world, and their feelings of helplessness in changing anything. Except, young people can exact change (just look at Kony 2012)…just like Katniss can challenge President Snow with a handful of poisonous berries.
Any one of these parts would have made him the highlight of the picture. With all three, the movie is utterly and wholly his, and it's easy to see why he was a Kubrick favorite. It doesn't make sense somehow that Kubrick and Sellers would be such a perfect match, but it's undeniable that they were.

Eventually the bombshell came. I was looking for a much loved and much worn t-shirt. “I’ve had a bit of a clear out. The scruffy t shirts are in the bin. Why not wear one of the new shirts I bought you that you’ve never worn?” It’s not all bad. Some aspects of living with a bird are pretty good. The sex, basically. Regular sex.
DESCHUTES BREWING unleashed a deluxe imperial stout called THE ABYSS upon the world at the tail end of 2007, yet in such insanely limited bottled quantities that I didn't even hear of it. Last year's THE ABYSS got out there in just about the right amount to both start a cult of believers (myself included) and to ensure it was limited enough to help generate a little supply-and-demand hype action. While the beer obviously speaks for itself (we rated last year's a 10/10), the marketing worked as well. This year, late 2009, DESCHUTES has let a lot more ABYSS unto the world than ever before. There are tons of bottles at my local BevMo, Whole Foods and at speciality retailers, all around a $11.99 price point, which is more than worth it in my book.

I did have a disappearing 9 patch block in mind when I bought the fabrics mentioned in my previous post. I came across this block by accident but thought it was cute. I believe it's also know as "9 to 4" because it starts life as a 9 patch, and ends up as 4 blocks. I decided that I was going to use 5" squares for this, although you could make them bigger or smaller according to preference.

Then, between two parables about feasts Jesus gives the very literal instruction that instead of inviting friends and family over for dinner you should invite the poor, the disadvantaged, and the broken. While this instruction was intended for a culture where you would know everybody in your town and regularly walk by one another’s homes with always open doors, it certainly still applies to us today in that we should show hospitality and kindness to people without distinction. In fact, we should go out of our way to show generosity and kindness to those who others would ignore.

I have noticed that there are a lot of insecure men and women out there who use flirting as a measuring stick to determine their value or desirability. As well, these same individuals also use flirting as a way to make their SO’s feel equally insecure and constantly feeling as if they could easily lose that person b/c the other party is constantly seeking to show that he or she has the ability to “move on” to greener pastures if they chose. They show this by constantly opening themselves up to other attractive persons of the opposite sex in front of their already SO’s. The only people who fall for this line of *thinking* are IDIOTS.
In 1971 Troughton published another paper treating C. hallstromi as a valid species; but two years earlier, following detailed studies of its breeding and offspring, Dr W. Schultz had proposed that it should be incorporated within the domestic dog’s species (Zoologischer Anzeiger, 1969). This was widely accepted, and today the creature is most commonly considered to be a long-established feral breed of domestic dog (as is the dingo), although a few researchers still favour its delineation as a separate species. Taxonomically, it has been classified variously as Canis familiaris dingo, C. lupus dingo, C. f. hallstromi, C. l. hallstromi, and C. hallstromi.

Well in 1996 when the Telecommunications Act was signed, it changed the game. Now anyone with the biggest checkbooks could come in and buy up many media outlets in the same geographic area, thus controlling what we heard on radio, saw on TV, and read in the newspapers. Then the internet and its power had not been realized by the masses, but was factored into this act along with landlines. This was the proverbial “nail in the coffin” for black radio as we knew it.

Just a word about locked and unlocked phones. Those deeply discounted phone that the carrier sells you new come locked up tighter than a drum. They are subsidizing the cost of the phone to make the price more attractive to you. The last thing in the world a carrier wants is for you to take their cheap phone and put it on another carrier’s network. That gets them nuts because the real money they make is in the monthly fees they know they can collect for at least 2 years. I say at least, because inertia keeps a lot of people using their same phone on the same network for the same monthly charge even after the contract expires, That’s just gravy for the cellular carriers.
Ohhhhh! I totally forgot about those. Here are a few of them. The photographer did a nice job considering what she had to work with. I hate what I'm wearing.

Sort of the dark inverse of Bluto, Del Toro's performance in Vegas is terrifying and darkly heroic, even to the point of terrorizing waitresses and destroying things for no reason and howling primordially in Las Vegas hotel bathrooms, vomiting all over the line between wild man acid head and just general asshole. When he likens del Toro's Dr. Gonzo to the last of the buffalo--a unique one of a kind original--at the end of the film, you finally begin to understand the relevance of what you have just seen. From thence forth drugs will have to be done on the sly, indoors, at shows or other safe havens. The days of giant monster men carving their carnivorous hallucinations large into the flesh of the mainstream are over. The gonzo method, apparently, includes leaving no bridge unburned behind you, only strings of draconian laws made to ensure no one pulls the same shit you

The main point of this blog is not to side particularly with one view or another – although you’ll clearly see where my personal instinct lies. If mental health professionals are sometimes mistakenly convinced or temporarily convinced that reaction to cannabis use is consistent with mental disorder; it must be accepted as reasonable that police officers will sometimes think this. Especially, this is the case where police decision-making must occur within minutes or seconds, rather than in an MHA interview which can take an hour or so. It has sometimes become necessary to ‘section’ people under the MHA for 28 days to fully work this stuff through.
Finally, remember that you need to think about the embellishments that Sherri Hill dresses are known for. These interesting dresses are full of glittery objects, patterned fabrics, and interesting ruffles and underskirts. Make sure these embellishments enhance your figure or your overall look before choosing them to go on your dress. With this advice, you can go out and conquer all the dress options that are out there by picking out the dress that is absolutely perfect for your figure, your skin, and your style. Make sure, too, that the dress serves to play up your personality by making you more confident in how you look. You can really be the belle of the ball if you pick out a dress according to these guidelines.

I'm usually quite sanguine about Spring Summer trends but this year I am buying into this one. Walking into clothes shops lately and seeing all those pastels lined up on the rails in all their macaroon tinted glory has literally made me feel like a kid in a candy store. I'm on the lookout for pastel shades in icy tones that suit my skin tone - ice pink, mint, lavender and ice blue - and then I want to wear them altogether! Something in my brain has snapped with the opening of the first daffodils here and I am suddenly craving lots and lots of colour. Or maybe my senses have just been fooled to think that all those sugary shades hitting the stores right now and delighting my eyes are going to fizz on my taste buds and delight my palate instead when I get around to wearing them.

One, because it is a good watch, and pretty quick, though I did take a few breaks while watching to let more of it “sink in.” And second, because it’s a great conversation starter, but impossible to have a conversation about it unless others watch. And while I wouldn’t mind having coffee with you all to chat about some of the things brought up and discussed in the film, I think it’d be even more useful if it became part of a large global or at least national discussion.

The context in which the revolution took place would be a pretty good place to start. Up to the 1930s, Spain was a largely preindustrial country controlled by wealthy landowners, the Catholic Church, and a series of monarchs and military dictators. Meanwhile, revolutionary fervor was brewing. Through the turn of the 20th century anarcho-syndicalism grew popular in rural Spain, and to a lesser extent in cities as well. The industrial sector was particularly rife with labor conflict. Strikes were a regular occurrence, and were often violently broken. Many thousands of workers were jailed or killed in numerous strike-busting clashes with bosses, police, and the military. In

Internal divisions in the heart of its province may be the last blow for PPP.
At this point I'm less interested in explaining to them the physics of things like rockets. They aren't that interested in abstract ideas such as propulsion, gravity, and resistance. They're more interested in stomping on a bottle and seeing how high they can propel a tube of paper. I'm hoping that experiences like this stick with them and they find interest in learning how those things work when they're a bit older.

"A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of custom."It may be partially that our sense of injustice and unfairness is sharper and more sensitive when we're children because we don't have a long history of thinking about much of anything, much less whether something is fair or unfair, wrong or right. It's all new to us, and clear and fresh. It is only over the trail of living that we learn to develop long habits of "not thinking a thing wrong" or unfair even when it is...it is then that we become susceptible to the illusion of the "superficial appearance of being right" or fair.

David O Russell initially made a name for himself with the idiosyncratic Spanking the Monkey in 1994, with his follow-up the low-key and equally quirky Flirting with Disaster (’96), then the superb Three Kings (’99) and the overtly droll and sadly unseen I Heart Huckabees (’04). While The Fighter is ostensibly a boxing film, it actually can rest quite assuredly on the shelf with Russell’s prior self-puncturing character studies, and it is indeed crafted with a potent mix of directorial dexterity and razor sharp acting.

Wagner International AG & Others v Earlex Ltd [2012] EWHC 984 (Pat) is a decision of Mr Justice Floyd on 18 April in the Patents Court, England and Wales. Though not a major ruling, enriched by profound pronouncements of legal principle, it is nonetheless instructive for the tidy and efficient manner in which the trial judge marshalled the evidence -- and as a reminder of how easily a claimant patent owner can sow at least some of the seeds of its own defeat in court through disclosure of its own prior art in an exhibition. Wagner's patent was for a paint spray gun with venting passages in the air cap which relieved the problem of back pressure to the air source. Earlex made a spray gun which, according to Wagner, infringed. Earlex denied infringement and counterclaimed invalidity.

Observation: When we look at the early church community, it is easy to get lost in the altruism of the apostles and their ability to share all of their wealth. However, I think if we forget about the prosperity preaching that is all too prevalent in today’s world, we could preach about the fact that we need to get back to giving of our first fruits to God. This does not just include our paychecks, but if we started to get back to giving the first tenth of our paychecks to the church, maybe the other first fruits would start to be given as well. I know I am using the literal interpretation of the word “tithe” here, but I hope someone will correct me if I have incorrectly interpreted the scripture in any way here.

I really do spend way too much time in my own head. I am thinking off the cuff now, but I think it makes for one huge ball of paranoia within. Sometimes I just hate me. My ways of thinking are always different than other peoples' ways of thinking. Yesterday the lady I work with told me that sometimes I am cranky. She later said she was "kidding," but I didn't think so. But while I thought I just get quiet when I'm cranky, the fact that she said it makes me think otherwise. Then she said that she "understands" because she knows I deal with the fallout from fibromyalgia and I never feel good.

Kant’s revolution has practically defined philosophy, certainly popular philosophy, ever since. From the German-language transcendental idealists, psychoanalysts, phenomenologists and critical theorists to the French-language existentialists, structuralists and deconstructionists to the English-language phenomenalists, language philosophers and, yes, cognitive scientists, it is hard to find any major philosophical movement of the last two hundred years that does not reflect the influence of Kant. He is one of the few canonical philosophers, whose influence can be seen in the views of the general public, including a great many people who have never heard of him or who do not appreciate that their own views are substantially Kantian. His message that our own minds broadly condition “how we see things” is congenial to a modern world of great cultural, ethnic and political diversity (notwithstanding the fact that Kant himself thought that the rational mind, qua rational, was the same for all).

Verity and I are also pleased to announce we have just covered our 100th wedding!! We are both overwhelemed with the response and feedback we have recieved. After starting our business only 2 years ago we feel so proud to have accomplished this goal! We will be doing a large feature and newsletter about it so keep looking back to hear more! Here’s to the next 100!!

Ok, I mean Eat IT! The benefits are the same as above but you could do this yourself at home and not need anyone to help you. I think most people are generally aghast at this idea, but it’s not so uncommon in other parts of the world. In fact there are many rituals and ceremonies that involve this, and are a way of welcoming the new baby into the community and celebrating its safe arrival. If you google this subject you can find many recipes and ideas from simple smoothies to bolognaise!
I wave over the carriage driver as a pace ahead of him, looking for a long flat surface of stone. I look for a candidate for what will serve as my shelter while I work.

Fortunately I realised my mistake before turning up at the store, so instead I had a little time to start painting a deffkopta.
Sunday was a beautiful spring day. We threw together a picnic with the turkey leftovers and other goodies and went to the National Historic Site.
At the end, I caught my breath in my throat it was so beautiful. I also thought about how fateful it was that I had just had this out of body dream-like experience the night before and now I was watching this! I couldn’t help but see similarities in my falling into the deepest reaches of sleep and how she describes having a stroke.

"I needed a light fantasy after reading a horribly depressing book with a wimpy heroine. This book fit the bill. It is a delightful story I thoroughly enjoyed. It is not a childish story. I would read a sequel in a heartbeat and I do think Lord Arkus' story should continue. Very well written and is very imaginative. I highly recommend."
Apart from this, there were issues over delayed payments or minimum guarantee by both parties and financial matters pertaining to entertainment tax adjustments in the revenue sharing formula.(Business Standard)
pretty much know what I thought about this performance. Tight, pacey, thrash-tastic fun. All their original tracks were on display in this short set and Troops of Doom was the cover of choice to make the crowd wanting more as they exited the stage to make way for Malaysians, Adokshiny. 4 fists.
So as I got ready to leave the house, I noticed that CPT left his phone charging. Oops. He's gonna need that. So, I drove on up to his work, looked around FOREVER for parking, and eventually found where he was. He didn't even realize that he'd left it at home. But he was SO grateful that I'd brought it to him :) I was happy to do my good deed for the day, and that it had been for my sweetheart!

dad-of-three has amassed an estimated £42million fortune as founder and chief of TLC Group, which provides services for the elderly.

And then our sister got sick and I reminded myself that life is short and beautiful and that I have to make the decision again to live and love abundantly.
And then, there are the things that I can’t turn around – no matter how hard I try. And part of this weekend will be about accepting that and then coming to grips with how I am going to survive without becoming bitter and sullen.
He announced that the grassroots movement just filed 21,700 signatures to force a recall election of his state senator, Republican Dan Kapanke, a supporter of Walker's union-busting law now blocked by a judge's restraining order. "He's the first to go!" Anderson shouted.

Feeling what I am feeling,
The Catholic thing was in fact probably the least arbitrary feature, it served a practical and strategic purpose until the start of the last century, whereas proper hereditary succession was thrown out the window when parliament invited foreign monarchs because the true heirs were deemed unsuitable - yet we lose one not the other, when both concepts are seriously out of step with society
The most popular kind of instruments in medieval Russia were thought to have been string instruments, such as the gusli or gudok. Archeologists have uncovered examples of these instruments in the Novgorod region dating as early as the 1000s. Other instruments in common use include flutes (svirel), and percussion instruments such as the treshchotka and the buben. The most popular form of music, however was singing. Bylinas (epic ballads) about folk heroes such as Sadko, Ilya Muromets, and others were often sung, sometimes to instrumental accompaniment.

I stamped the butterflies on white card stock and used colored pencils, blending stumps, and odorless mineral spirits for the shading. After the shading was complete, I went in again with a brown colored pencil and added some darker coloring which I left without any extra blending for some contrast.

There are two modes of listening, either at the computer, or on a mobile device. Bizarrely, these companies charge more if you listen on a carry around device with a tinny sound rather than a big computer you can connect to stereo speakers and blast away your songs in all their sonic glory.

Wait. Listen. Let me see if I can adequately confer how mind blowing this cake is. Because I know you. You'll just sit there, reading, clearly drooling all over your keyboard and never once get off your derriere to make this cake. What a disservice to your belly. This cake is sinfully good. In fact I said a prayer by the time I took a third heaping slice in one night. "God,..." I cooed innocently, "please watch over me, and don't let this go to my ass. Amen." What! World peace as a prayer rarely works.
I've gotten lost several times in a city I used to know like the back of my hand. I'm now terrified of driving and am hunched over the steering wheel like a little old lady with sweaty palms and a racing heart whispering "ohmygodohmygodohmygod." Related, I've discovered my two kids are afraid of riding in cars, especially when going up and down steep hills, of which there are many in Seattle. They both scream at the top of their lungs and Lucien yells, "IS THIS HILL ALMOST DONE, MOMMY?" It makes errand-running super exciting but is not helping my driving nerves any.

My two young daughters love to play dress-up. Most of their play jewelry consists of elastic string and small plastic beads, which unfortunately do not hold up to much pulling and stretching. This bracelet made from ribbon is not only fun to make and easy to personalize, but it also stands up to the rough play of young children!
Having our van well stocked is handy in many circumstances, maybe we forgot to pack something when going camping, or -as just happened the other day- the kids fall in the river while out canoeing and would like to change clothes before going home, or we are out in the state forest picking blueberries and we get stuck and and hungry. And then also should we ever need to evacuate quickly (hard to imagine but possible I am sure) it sure would be nice to have some extra things in the van. I wrote a post about all the things that we in our van which you can check out if you like.
“Solomon was a pretty messed up guy when he died. Having read Ecclesiastes often, life is not about being nice or being bad, because all of us have sinned and have fallen short of the glory of God, according to the book of Romans, chapter 3:23. I hear your sarcasm but I like your perspective in your other articles much better because they spread hope and encouragement. This is just my opinion and I don’t mean to step on your toes. There are a lot of people out there that look through the glasses of despair and irony and sarcasm. Don’t misunderstand me, I know these things exist and there are people who are living double lives but it doesn’t mean I have to join the crowd. I enjoy your positive articles tremendously. In a world that touts out so much negativity, your articles were a shining light, so I’ll pass on this one. Ciao, Patricia”

How does he keep me when I think I might not be a Christian?
People like these, wherever they’re from, love to claim that the American founding fathers – who produced the greatest, most powerful and most enduring democracy in human history – were a bunch of atheists; the only problem is that nothing can be further from the truth. The fact of the matter is that our founding fathers were overwhelmingly Christian; and the one or two who weren’t (such as Benjamin Franklin) readily acknowledged that the Christian religion was a good thing rather than a bad one.
Hello lovelies! I hope you had a wonderful weekend. We had a pretty low key one around here with lots of naps. I wish we had been busier but I think it's good to have a relaxing weekend every now and then. Plus, I'm headed out of town next weekend so I will get my fill of busy then.
There is more about her visit and her novels on Bolton’s blog (which is very nicely designed, by the way). I am uncertain about reading Bolton’s new novel, which deals with a modern-day “Jack the Ripper” copycat murderer. I, for one, am not ready for another “Ripper” novel.
On that basis, Suarez did not, and does not have a chance. It doesn’t matter if he is eventually exhonerated by the FA or in a court of law. As far as the general public are concerned, Suarez is, and always will be a racist. And that just isn’t fair.

Those of us who lived here when Prospect Heights was a crime-ridden empty area remember what it was like. We knew where we wanted Brooklyn to go based on where we started. But the people who moved in just ten years ago, they liked it the way it was, and they don’t want it to change. But this is a snapshot. It is not the end of the movie.”

No specialist yet. Not for another month or so but at least I am walking. Watch me go!
This one is my Sketch Challenge for Challenge Heaven, where I am on the Design Team. I'm not entirely sure about this one... it's the light colours with no contrast I think. I like it, but I think I should have used a darker background maybe. I like the photos though, they remind me of a very happy outing. The letters in the title are interesting. I found an old cheap fake scrabble set in a charity shop, with these little letters. They are plastic tiles with sticker letters. Well, who could pass that up? Perfect for titles :-)

In the late fall we began to receive humanitarian aid shipped into the city via UN convoys. At first excited that we might eat a potato or a piece of fruit, we soon realized that this aid was not enough to ward off hunger pains and certainly was not nutritional by any means. The first distribution of humanitarian aid ranks as one of the most exciting and disappointing events of my life. Eagerly standing in line we waited for the basement door of the building next to ours to open, signaling the begining of the food distribution.

Kira meandered around the clearing beyond the well, waiting. Her long dark hair hung loose down her back and blew in the breeze every time she turned around. The minutes ticked by and the night grew longer. But, still he didn’t come. Kira tried to keep the disappointment from her mind. She really thought that he would meet her. He seemed like he had wanted to, he seemed like he had agreed. But, finally, she had to admit that he wasn’t coming.
Meanwhile, I go through the motions, and hold to routine. (I am not sure whether to be grateful for or shaken by the fact that the world is so immune to rupture; that the world, despite personal upset, plods dementedly ahead.) I attend to my papers. I submit invoices. I manage inventory. I pay the bills. I try, and I fail, to sleep.

Grief-stricken and determined to grant Finn's last request, she rushes to leave immediately. But she only gets as far as the driveway before running into Rusty, Finn's best friend since third grade and his polar opposite. She hasn't seen him in ages, thanks to a falling out between the two guys, but Rusty is much the same as Honor remembers him: arrogant, stubborn. . . and ruggedly good looking. Neither one is what the other would ever look for in a road trip partner, but the two of them set off together, on a voyage that makes sense only because it doesn’t. Along the way, they find small and sometimes surprising ways to ease their shared loss and honor Finn--but when shocking truths are revealed at the end of the road, will either of them be able to cope with the consequences?

#183 Chuck Crim - The show must go on, here with Chuck Crim, who is one of the more anonymous guys of the pack. After a decent rookie year in 1986, Crim led the league in games pitched in 1988 and 1989. Though he pitched very well in those years, the high innings total took a tole on Crim, and his ERA went up and up until his retirement after the 1994 season. What could have been without the high innings? Who knows?

One suggested name that also was in contention was Banga-pradesh, the pradesh( province) part seeking to specify that it is not a ‘desh’ or nation by itself and to underscore its unquestionably within-India-ness. Others suggested banga-bharati, a not-so-ingenious rip-off from Rabindranath Thakur’s Visva Bharati. It might as well have been called Delhi-Bengal or Dilli-Bongo, to make the attachment to the heart of Mother India ever so tight. Among the list of alternatives were Bawngodesh and Bawngobhoomi. Both had inadequacies that mired names like Bengal or Bangla – a pretension to a quarter-baked wholeness that flew in the face of the reality of indelible trans-border connections. Another alternative ‘Gour-Bawngo’ harkened back to some mythic continuity to an older name for a certain part of Bengal. It would have been inadequate, regressive and plain fictional, in the present context.

I wrapped up my second D&D 4e session in Goodman Games Mists of Madness adventure module last week. It's a full module by Harley Stroh that only costs $2 (disclaimer- I bought the pdf during a recent sale at rpgnow for even less) and is for 1st level parties which is just what I needed. It is advertised as being 32 pages long, but after subtracting the OGL and advertisements is only around 25 pages in length. The adventure follows a well worn plot as the party must defeat a band of evil cultists before they can summon a lich. WARNING- there be spoilers ahead.

Sometimes you feel like you are living yet dead, when your body roams the earth freely doing all of life's daily activities, but your soul, it keeps wandering in an unknown world screaming out to someone to hear you, to hear you, hold you, lend their shoulders to cry on, wipe away your tears... you cant set yourself free nor can others... if they might hear you or not... but then, you realize there is no one who will set you free no matter how much you scream out loud or in silent echoes!!!!!! No ones going to see you even if your cries are loud enough... yes sometimes they might see you but not the real you... they'll all see you the way they want to... and deep inside that battlefield of rain-forests somewhere you are a tangled mess of intertwined vines and you can help but just remain invisible!!!

The paintings stop short of representation, they only hint at it. Or they feel like stopping short in exploration. Like reproductions of Abstract Expressionist paintings mechanically enlarged- all the details are lost, smoothed out. Most serious painters loath the misreading of a painting. The type of comment like, “that looks like a metallic tit with a dent in it.” And while Morris does not court such Rorschach-ing, she does accept it, and has moved away from titles in order to further free up a viewer’s interpretation. Back to the masses, and how they handle abstract art that isn’t decoration, viewers often tend to cling to a title. But this isn’t just the public, everyone is like this. If you feel like you don’t “get” a piece of art you feel stupid, especially if you are one of the initiated. So if a piece has a title like “Lavender Mist” you tend to think it is about that. And then it almost ceases to be abstract at all. That Pollock isn’t a bunch of nonrepresentational, meaningless drips, it is a painting of mist, and now I can like it because now I know what it means. This plays into what Walker points out in his essay on Morris when he is discussing painting’s relationship to other paintings, “In other words, paintings are read in and through reference to other paintings begging the question, once abstraction has acquired legibility is there such a thing as an abstract painting?“ The question of abstract painting having legibility is in relation to other paintings but also, I feel a legibiltiy in relation to a meaning or intreptation. If an abstract painting is only understood, or ‘read” as being related to another painting, than it is a reference, a sign. It is nolonger an abstraction. So can abstract painting exist then? The answer is bluntly put as “’Hells Yes.’” Especially since, and this is certainly the with case with Rebecca Morris, there is no one true answer, reading, interpretation or comparison to be made. One way this is achieved is her adoption of a coded numerical system to catalog the paintings. Essentially this titles the work even less than “untitled.” This further abstracts the painting as lauguage of any type, save that of painting, has been removed. There is the code, the numerical structure, but that is a hidden device for personal reference, and so it is not part of how the viewer would experience it. This also calls into question the whole notion of labelling art at all. Should these paintings have any tags at all for viewers? No date, no title, no medium. Don’t worry about it, just look at the painting. How often do people hang art they own in their homes with wall labels? They have all the documentation filed away, but it is not a part of the piece, so it is not hanging on the wall next to it.
I'd also like to see more local content in literary festivals, especially for first-time authors who haven't necessarily been journalists in a past life. And networking opportunities: wouldn't it be great if we feted new authors at social events like we do actors and sports stars (though I personally wouldn't have a thing to wear!).

In the case of the Sept 29, 2011 Fukushima-Daichi NPP fallout maps for Japan, the link no longer leads to the pdf, but instead to a lame “Error 404 – Not Found”.
a. Eph 5:26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, Eph 5:27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
And final suggestion: I'd like to see more attention to ingrediants. Depending on what I'm making and for whom there are occassions when I don't think the quality improvement warrants the extra cost of certain things. But, when I'm making something that is essentially booze, i.e. a martini, I want something better than mediocre gin, which is what we were dealing with. The selection was a hodge-podge of miscellaneous mainly low-end product.
And part of me gets the feeling that she still doesn’t get it. So I add:
When I see you staring at me from across the room and I roll my eyes and turn away – that’s a good indication for you to NOT COME NEAR ME. When me and a friend are clearly in the middle of a deep conversation - NOT A GOOD TIME. When I’m on a date with a guy and he’s gone to the bathroom, THAT DOESN’T GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO COME AND TALK TO ME.
Sloe gin is a classic and usually made with sloes picked around November after the first frost but I faked this process by freezing my sloes for a day. Once defrosted prick them with a fork and fill in a sterilized glass bottle. Add sugar and alcohol, in my case vodka rather than gin, and mix up. Agitate once every day for about 4 weeks and after that once a week for another 3-6 month. Over time the colour of the concoction will change to a deep red. Strain and keep in the dark.

In addition to the current and former TSA officials, one drug courier is currently in state custody, and another drug courier is expected to surrender tomorrow.

The Communist Party of Australia dissolved itself in 1991 and David McKnight was the editor of the CPA paper Tribune for some time before the party closed up shop. The CPA rump became the New Left Party for a while and David may have been associated with that. One day I might ask him.
As the next election approaches, it may be that we see a growing number of odd looking individuals lurking at the school gates, if so, you need not worry, they are only after your kid's vote!
I feel that US crude will hit 100 driven by traders trying to push short sell stops
If war comes, we may see the bizarre spectacle of European patriots supporting a war of aggression against Pakistan as a reaction to the propaganda of the Zionists leading us into war. The Establishment have created Breivik and groups such as the EDL to form a solid support base for their wars. Europeans will die as a result of the coming war. Pakistanis will die in their own country, provoking anger in the colonies, which may spill over into bloodshed in our homeland. The Zionists who will gain from this will be safe in their well-guarded communities.
These are just a few I saw at Home Depot and Target.
To me, this journey is all about Light. Energy. Yes, there’s the mass arrests coming up. Yes, there’s the Liens and the Fed falling and the G7 banks falling, and the euro crashing and the underground bases crashing, and all that. But I find it much simpler to get through all this by remembering that I am Light. The most important thing I can “do” is to shine it. However that might be. And the most important thing I can “be” is to be that Light. See myself as the High Vibration being that I really am. Not a body. But Light.

“That’s right, Bantum, remember what happened to Ibis. It almost killed his arm.”
The Magician stands between the primordial mother, hidden beneath the surface of the water, and the primordial father, with his sun and infinite lemniscate. The two trees are the doorway between the spiritual and the corporeal world, and the Magician, cloaked in the brown of earth, is handing us a Metatron’s Cube (or a Phoenix’s egg). The dark of the abyss shows in that under the Magician’s cloak we only see black – there are no facial features.

So those who criticize economic stimulus measures aren’t looking at the real economy. With retail sales soaring, particularly motor vehicle sales (thanks to Obama’s Detroit auto bailout), the consumer has again been growing the economy. Retail sales are growing at 5 percent plus annually, just like in pre-recession, boom years. Core components excluding gasoline and auto sales showed widespread strength. Standouts included building materials & garden equipment, furniture & home furnishings, electronics & appliances, and clothing, which tells us home buying might be next on their list. Declines were seen in miscellaneous store retailers and in health & personal care.

"It's hard to believe anything with a beat could grow in a landscape as otherworldly and physically inhospitable as that of Iceland. Mother Nature, in all her harshest majesty, is the headline act here. She is not easily upstaged. Nevertheless, in a small rehearsal space on a snowy, windblown side street in central Reykjavik, a local band called the Sugarcubes is busy proving that rock & roll is not only alive and well here but mutating into shapes as odd and wondrous as the geologist's paradise outside." David Fricke, Rolling Stone, July 1988.

Bela has been doing pretty darn good. I'm amazed by her.. as usual. She dosn't want to be held back any longer! She begs me to go to the park, got to the store, get back to anything normal. We're taking it slow, but she's been out to the park a couple times when it's been not too busy and she's so happy to be sitting in the sand with her shovel in hand. Sometimes it's like she didn't skip a beat. She has times still though where she seems tired, or grumpy, or like something bothers her but she just can't quite tell what it is. But overall, oh my gosh! 3 weeks post-op and she's a rockstar! I'm just so darn proud of her, for doing something so hard and for coming out of it so well. She tells everyone that she just got her heart fixed and sometimes even shows them. I'm never quite sure how to react when she pulls her shirt right up. It's like she's actually almost proud of it, as she should be, but I cannot understand how at 4 she feels that way instead of just being plain old mad about it. We've talked with her a lot about it, so I hope she understands to the best of her little ability. Sometimes I think she understands it all better than I do! She's eating a little better this week too. The only thing not improving much is her sleep. She's up all night and moans and tosses and turns and climbs in bed with us and continues to moan and toss and turn. Last night I sorta lost some patience with it.. I love snuggling with her but I really don't sleep when she's in bed with me. But she gets so sad when I put her back in her own bed (which is about 2 feet away from mine). I think she's getting spoiled, but how do I not? I don't know what to do..hmm. Hopefully with a little more time she'll start sleeping more. For some crazy reason I'm still awake. Of course she's been sleeping great since 8...

The universe is very clever at orchestrating wonder when we least expect it. For Estée Lauder, one of those moments occurred during her travels. “I’d picked up a green leaf in Palm Beach one day, deeply inhaled its scent with wonder, and knew I had to recreate that scent.” The resulting fragrance was Aliage, a timeless green chypre released in 1972 that continues to inspire.

A few things to note before reading:
They focus on form not substance, taking away old laws such as the Internal Security Act, while introducing more questionable – although untested ones, such as the Security Offences (Special Measures) Bill. The same focus on form underscores the government’s last-minute conciliatory offer of four alternative locations for Bersih 3.0.
People seem to dig these vintage TV Guide ads - and why not? They're powerful memory triggers, especially for those of us who grew up in the pre-cable, pre-Internet Stone Age of the 1970s. This advertisement for the U.S. network television premiere of Ed Hunt's Starship Invasions is a great example. I was always the first one in my house to grab the new TV Guide when it showed up in the mail, and immediately pored over its pages, looking for cool stuff to watch, so I could plan my schedule accordingly. I remember being pretty damned excited when I came across this particular ad in my weekly review of the magazine.

I know I have been non existent in this blogging world lately, but i haven't had time to do anything lately with this jewelry stuff. It's taking over I swear! Anyway I thought I'd share some of our pre deployment pictures with you, and I promise very soon I will be back in the blogging world I will definitely need the support of my fellow wives to make it through this deployment!

She checked on everything and then told me that if by Friday nothing had changed that we would try a homeopathic remedy and see if that got things going. She told me there is a reason this is happening and to soak up all the relaxing I could. After my nap, I completely agreed.

Amos 2:1-3… God roars against Moab… “because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime” (KJV)… Moab was a descendent of Lot… (Genesis 19:29-38)… Moab became indignant with a friend who had befriended an enemy (2 Kings 3:7-27). The king of Moab sacrificed his own heir to his false god… This act sickened everyone who saw it and the battle was abandoned. Here… God judged the holding of grudges… They crossed the line when they were not satisfied with an enemy’s death… they wanted to inflict further hatred by burning the bones. We sometimes manifest this same spirit when we see someone in a trial and we say, “Serves them right.”

Haidt is a liberal who wants his political tribe to understand humans better. His main insight is simple but powerful: liberals understand only two main moral dimensions, whereas conservatives understand all five. (Over the course of the book he decides to add a sixth, liberty/oppression, but for simplicity’s sake I am sticking to his original five.)

The rest of the meet was rather ho hum in comparison, as the lack of big names showed. The Golden League should be a bit more careful in scheduling its meets - especially as it expands next season. With several National Championship meets being held within the next two weeks, it might be prudent to avoid scheduling too close to these meets. Just food for thought.

“Did they kill him?” Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) asks Catwoman in the trailer, presumably referring to Batman. Blake is seen throughout the trailer, indicating his role is more important than that of a mere street cop. Some have speculated Gordon-Levitt is the new Robin recruit, others are saying he may be subbing in for Batman himself (if true—OMG!), and others yet wonder whether Blake takes the codename “Azrael” as part of his effort to help Batman.
The question then becomes what’s so bloody special about human beings? Why would someone think we were different? Strikes me as particularly arrogant, as arrogant as claiming we have ‘souls’ and animals don’t.
It was nice to see this old quilt. As you can tell, the fabrics are really old. These were the only types of quilting fabrics available to us in the 1980s. I still don't like prints and the plain fabrics were polyester/cotton broadcloth. There were solid fabrics in cotton available in quilt stores but the prices were quite high. Poly/cotton broadcloth had a huge variety of colours to choose from too, whereas the cottons were extremely limited in choice. Things sure have come a long way.

The biggest revelation of this episode was the presence of No One and his relationship with Anja’s deranged flatmate. Is this the Truth Terrorist? How many disciples does he have? I’m not so keen on serial killers who network so this was a bit disappointing if I’m honest. It smacks of producer-logic to me: if one serial killer is scary, then a whole heap of them must be terrifying. Plus, it seems so unlikely. How would a serial killer even go about getting disciples, advertise on Craig’s List? Our disciple’s plans for the morrow don’t bode well, especially if he keeps swishing that sword around. On a serious note, I hope the BBC4 programmers are treading carefully with what’s ahead as a maniac on a violent killing spree is not an appropriate thing to show in the midst of the Breivik trial.
Everyone is totally loving New Orleans and I am loving getting to show everyone around and seeing their reactions to everything. priceless! We managed to luck out and catch a bus back right away, but instead of hopping out at Providence House, we got off at Winn Dixie and did our grocery shop for the week. Lots of fresh fruit and vegetables went into the carts and we are ready for breakfasts and lunches! I love that Winn Dixie is walkable from the hotel.
I am a huge fan of Regency romances, and yes, they definitely inspired me. In the novels of Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer, the romantic heroines frequently have younger sisters who are minor characters, popping up only for a scene or two - just long enough to offer decidedly snarky opinions on their sisters’ love lives. In A Most Improper Magick, I wrote a novel from a youngest sister’s POV, making her the true hero of the story and giving her magical adventures of her own that take place alongside her older sisters’ romances…and of course she’s more than ready to take charge of her older sisters’ love lives, too!
So now I want to know from you. Honestly and openly - I can handle it all, really - go have a look, come back and tell me what you think.

We kept the little collar we bought for Miss D (no, we didn’t name her that, but we did call her Doxie now and then) and Ella put it around her stuffed dog’s neck.

“We’re very sorry, especially to all the ‘Beliebers’ out there, and particularly to those who attended the concert, that this had to happen,” said Ng Chong Wan, a representative of the concert organiser SkinnyGirlz Sdn Bhd. “The timing could have been better, of course but really, you can’t help it if mother nature decided to turn you from a little boy into a mature man while you’re on stage, performing in front of 15,000 screaming fans.

Somewhere in all this, the name of the main character (Mason McGee) was changed to Atticus Higginbottom.

In the October, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had to wait until January for a biopsy, by which time they could not operate because the cancer had spread to her liver.

Dash didn’t disappoint me. Totally focussed on the retrieve – “dashing” out at a great speed to the dummy and returning to me (also at great speed) to deliver (most of the time) to hand. Of course she is still not steady and had to be restrained after the shot and throw until she was calm and could be released, and still a bit noisy, but very accurate in her marking and with a fabulous hunt in the longer grass, keeping to a really tight hunt with persistence that I have rarely seen in such a young dog. I’m delighted with her, apart from the excited squealing when she takes off. I’m confident that will improve with time and training though.
What I also saw was that there will not be any ministry coming up to work on our limitation , the land. Our land is limited, we have to daringly come up with a fix or limited population.

SENIOR civil servants could be benefiting from personal income tax rates as low as 2% using controversial pay deals that cost the country tens of millions of pounds in lost revenue. Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, said last week his department had identified up to 2,000 officials who could be minimising tax because they are paid through companies or agencies, rather than the government payroll.

After last week’s Dair kiss, things are a bit awkward. It’s so interesting when all of the relationships on this show are up in the air. Anyway, in order to salvage her and Serena’s friendship, Blair is hell-bent on demonstrating she is strictly friends with Lonely Boy. Apparently, when Blair is in LOVE, she avoids the person like the plague. I never thought of that but that’s kind of true. Good thinking Serena! (There’s a sentence I never thought I’d write!) Blair then decides to spend the day with Dan at the stage/fake play of his book, where coincidence! Lola is playing Blair’s part. Of course, immediately after arriving, Blair starts to make fun of everyone there. The bit about the headband was particularly well –thought out! The two “friends” bicker and annoy the crap out of each other all day (you know, the usual) until Blair has to kiss Dan to prove to him that the previous kiss was just a fluke. Who would have thought the kiss would turn out to be so HOT! But alas, Blair is not convinced… Until, Dan has to go when he receives a call that his new manuscript has been erased…

Debt ceiling poll: Voters with Obama: Most Americans would like to see a mix of spending cuts and tax increases be part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling, a new poll finds, aligning the majority with President Barack Obama’s position. Of those surveyed for a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday, 56 percent said they want to see a mix of approaches used in an agreement to raise the debt ceiling. The poll was conducted overnight Monday, as Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) voiced their views on the impasse in negotiations in back-to-back televised primetime speeches.

Southern Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell (died in 2007) may have been the first leader to recognize the potential for linking dispensational Christianity with Zionism and harness its combined power into a political movement with loyalty to the state of Israel as its primary and passionate mission. In the early 1980s, Falwell called his fledgling army “The Moral Majority.” It was later referred to as the “Christian Right.” Today the millions of people who have made the present state of Israel the centerpiece of their Christian religion have been given the name “Christian Zionists.” (3)
Young, old or in-between, this is an experience will always remain in your psyche. However, I have found on my journey that it seems to be easier for someone who is younger to bounce back. Maybe it is because society does not expect someone who is past a certain age to make the mistakes that they do. Well, we all make mistakes – big and small – and not only do they affect the people around us; they also affect how we perceive ourselves.

An all time average of 117% and a today’s rate of 88% for large fleets perhaps provide one money trail found. The Intermodel Insurance Company reports that Noel Perry, managing director at consultant FTR Associates, Nashville, Ind., whose latest driver supply report gauged the shortage at 125,000 in the third quarter said, “We are almost certainly going to see an increase (in driver shortage).”

After a few days of being stuck in the house until Matt got out of work it was easy to twist his arm to take us to the Beach. I was amazed by the sand. It was like powder. Michigan lake sand is like dirt and crushed rock. I dug my toes deep and it was so soft and fine. I loved it. It was amazing!
Irena kept a dog in the back that she trained to bark when the Nazi soldiers let her in and out of the ghetto. The soldiers, of course, wanted nothing to do with the dog and the barking covered the kids/infants noises.

Once upon a time ... it was May 2005 and I was a senior in high school, dating a 22-year-old guy. I've already elaborated on how awkward that was at times, but it became espeeeeeecially awkward when Prom season rolled around. I wasn't even sure I wanted to go, but I felt obligated, being a super-cool senior and all. Plus, who doesn't like getting all fixed up to go dancing at some overpriced venue with a bunch of sweaty teenagers?

Ching played the exhibition for four months, then took vaudeville bookings on the Keith circuit. After a year, he was so wildly successful that countless imitators sprang up with similar names and acts. Among them were: Tung Pin Soo, Long Talk Sam, Han Pin Chien, Li Ho Chang, Rush Ling Toy, Chin Sun Loo and more than one of each of the following: Chung Ling Sen, Chung Ling Hee, and Chung Ling Fee. But the grandaddy of all these was…

But then there’s also the attempts to control Hollywood, both from the control of writing in screenplays (as reported by Truthout and I linked to here) to “bad luck” such as Clooney’s on the set of Syriana and perhaps what lead to Wesley Snipes stopping paying his taxes during the Bush administration, and even assassination, such as in the cases of Heath Ledger, David Carradine, and Ronni Chasen. This is for war economy propaganda.
On that note, I looked at my dissertation from my masters the other day and too be honest, I’d love to write it again because this blog has actually taught me how to write. I’ve learned about things like structure, style, context, the voice I should be using, and so much more. When I was writing my dissertation, I was too busy being distracted by Facebook, so I reckon that being distracted by my blog wouldn’t make a huge difference.
I reached Love+ mode in ~66 game days and the first thing I did was try to talk to her but she didn't seem to understand what I was saying. I think it's partly because my Japanese pronunciation isn't perfect and because my voice is rough and a bit abnormal. I've walked Nene to school a few times since I usually go to bed after 8AM but the game's in real time so it's hard to be there often since I'm nocturnal like a bat. I also feel insecure about making dates and interacting with her because I'm afraid I'll mess up and then she'll hate me.

The year has been so kind to Duke. I think he knows that he's loved more than anything, and that he is a treasured member of our family. When he came to live with us a year ago, he weighed about 50 pounds. When he went back to the vet a few weeks ago for his annual check up, he weighed in at a whopping 82 pounds! You couldn't look at this boy and think that he doesn't eat well or often!
"There were Great Ones of pure light who danced in the lands above the sky. Time did not pass for them, for there was no time. Distance did not matter to them, for there was no distance...but one day Others appeared in their lands and began to dance too. Instead of pure light, they were made of something different, and as their dancing grew stronger, their whirling forms began to cover the pure white skirts of the Great Ones with patterns of colour. And the colour was blue..."I'm always fascinated to see how other authors see the mythic beings I love, and Gillian's beautifully informative piece taught me a thing or two I didn't know.

But colleges and universities have failed to mitigate this phenomenon. For example, over the last few decades, the typical public four-year college has seen a sharp expansion of its support and managerial staff — from 5.5 per 100 students in 1987 to 7.5 per 100 in 2007. Colleges have also been reducing student-to-faculty ratios, and increasing spending on fringe offerings like gyms and student centers. As a result, expenditures per student by public institutions of higher education rose 48 percent from 1985 to 2009, after adjusting for inflation. Can we really say that higher education has gotten anywhere close to 48 percent better over that period?

After we have our measurement discussion, I always let them make cards. Those work as both a language arts and an etiquette lesson. My favorite thing to ask is "what advice would you give the baby." Those responses are always so cute and insightful. The cards can all be sent with a teacher or someone else who is close to the mom. I have had teacher after teacher tell me how appreciated those cards were.
On all fronts things had quickly gone from bad to worse, the beleaguered adventurers unable to halt so many attempting to skirt past them; more than dozen skeletons slipped by surrounded defenders, engaged then by the dwarves deeper in the entrenchment as Thane Fenris and Old Gorrak shouted out over the battlefield. Anselme and Leone had been further engaged by one of the minotaur skeletons, while Emma struggled to avoid becoming mired by so many foes–some taking to desperately grabbing at the barbarian where their blows failed to breach her considerable durability and vigor.

You presumably can actually think about drawing up a listing of the completely different relationship providers that are open to you. When you do then try to seek for extra details about the sites just to ensure you are happy with what they’re offering and so that you are happy with their providers as properly as finding out what others take into consideration them who have really used them. This might be a valuable means in finding out more about a relationship web site as a end result of a web site can solely let you know a lot, it’s essential to find out what individuals think about the positioning that have really used it. This might help you get a better image of a site.

Ask any Trinidadian cook what herb they must have and culantro (also called shadon beni - pronounced shadow benny- and bandanya) tops the list. We use it to season meats and fish (bound for stews, the grill, the frying pan or the oven), salads, soups, curries. You get the picture - anything savory. Its peppery, lemony scent is quite distinct and offers a level of freshness lacking in other herbs. Ok, I am biased. What can I say? It's been used in cooking throughout my life so forgive my sales pitch. Finding culantro in the markets of Queens was not a difficult task- look right next to the thyme and cilantro- but Minnesota is a different story altogether. I was lucky a couple of years ago to find it at the farmers' market. If not, try your closest Vietnamese store. (Last I checked, Sun Foods in Brooklyn PArk stocked it.) If you have exhausted all means and still cannot find it, then a suitable substitute in this recipe is the common cilantro. Whichever herb you use, I hope you have fun with this recipe and enjoy eating it as much as I did.

Bottom line I guess is that we all have a dark moments of doubt, depression, despair - everyone is different but for me figuring a coping strategy as quick as possible, sticking to it and being open & honest with those that you love and trust to share your feelings and concerns seemed to work for me.
The genius and subtlety of the writing illuminates Michael. He is not simply recounting his memories to the audience, a reflection of the action you see onstage. He is an active participant in the re-living of his memories, enlightened and transformed along with the people he is remembering. He brings the audience along with him, casting light into the furthest corners of the experience everyone is witnessing.
After some thought, it seems that this would be an issue for any trial, but not a preliminary point. The case of Graham v HMA 1969 SLT 116 seems to deal with the issue. Here a challenge to the competency and relevancy of a perjury indictment failed where the accused had answered a potentially self incriminating question in a murder trial without the judge cautioning him. The court held that, as perjury was a separate matter from the original offence, that it was entirely proper for such a case to be tried in the absence of a caution. The court said that the issue could be addressed at trial, taking account of all the circumstances under which the evidence was given.

Balls also change when it's cold. It can sometimes be referred to as "shrinkage." Which brings me to my next point. I can't take a cold shower even when it's burning hot. It's like a cat, they don't like water because they look smaller when their fur is wet, and therefor they are less intimidating. So I end up taking a hot shower, not only to avoid that "I'm dying of hypothermia I can't breath" feel, but also to protect myself if someone should happen to initiate a naked shower attack like in Psycho. Or if my mom happens to walk in.
Seeing little Bessie growing up makes me so sad my child bearing days are over. I do miss having such a little one in the house, I miss the breastfeeding and the sling wearing.

Footnote 30.04.2012: There is a little bit more flurry of activity about the pronouncement on the new Caliph. And perhaps it is enlightening (but predictable) that it has become some subject of ridicule and even vilification in some Muslim forums. It is also ironic that the only online coverage is by Muslims forums that attack the good King Abdullah as either unworthy (read too Western), a traitor to the Arabs, a CIA flunky or even worse, an Israeli-zionist agent on one hand, and on the other hand are a whole tribe of neo-con fundamentalist 'Christian' end-of-time Dominionist websites (like Jihadwatch) that have long eyed King Abdullah, being a direct descendant of the Prophet (pbuh) as a likely candidate for the Caliph.

Yet, something that wasn’t quite as well built up. That, for those of you who might be curious, was the relationship between Ansel and Sophia. For something so small and mostly trivial, it’s ironic that it’s the thing that irritated me the most about this book. Why it annoyed me so, I have no other reason than “damn you people who love without entertaining angst neither independently nor direct at each other to read about”. Needless to say, I’m quite confused too. But apparently my curse had some effect because the people who seemed the most upbeat suffered the most in the long run. I suppose this must be a signal from my latent psychic abilities. I should probably correspond with those soon. Anyhow, on the front that devotes it’s time to pursuing genuine issues seems to have become obsessed with the rather bizarre concept of souls in the story, which seemingly appeared out of nowhere, and while it did hold some relevance to the plot (it flaunted it, in fact. It was a bit like the setting, although in a more “look at this expensive new gadget” type way.), it didn’t really fit in with the rest of the story. Other than that, there weren’t any glaring flaws, other than the actual story takes a while to realise the direction it’s going, instead of just pouring in copious amounts of foreshadowing into the story. This is did occur, but it is not advised – plots often become rather giddy when exposed to large amounts of foreshadowing.
If I am confused about picking a book, I try to read the first paragraph or two, just to get a faint idea of what to expect in the book. During those times, I act a bit like an agent. Interesting first lines can hook me big time. Many times, after an interesting first few pages, the rest of the book has disappointed me.

I loved the opening of this episode. It was a stark (sorry) reminder that not all Lannister soldiers are evil, as the previous episode would have us believe. It was nice to see two men at arms having a conversation that I’m sure many fans have had- who would win in a fight between x and y? I was intrigued to see that rumours of Renly’s bed time preferences have spread as far as the lowly foot soldiers. Sadly, such merriment was short lived, as Grey Wind arrived to turn the poor soldiers inside out.

I wear it as a necklace now and it’s a bit quirky. But really, what other way is there to live this crazy life?

Update certain paperwork for our dossier that is set to expire next month. Do all of my Christmas shopping - because I know I will have zero desire to do it when I get home.
The Romans had little interest in adapting their roads to local topography. They cut through hills and mountains and filled valleys to build level roads.

We are troubled by circumstances. The disciples are out on the sea in a tempestuous storm and they look out across the waters and see what they think is a spirit. It was really the Lord Jesus. They were terrified with fear (Mt. 14:26 & Mk 6. 50). In the Book of Luke, we see Martha "troubled about many things" (Lk 10:41) because she was doing all of the physical labour. Circumstances cause us trouble.

The fact is the majority, if not all of “reality” television is not a reality. Indeed it is far from it. Episodes are staged. Scenes re-shot from camera angles.

No, probably not (well except your glares at random passerbyers but that’s not the point.

But I did go out to Queens yesterday to visit my friend Johanna, avid sewing machine collector and knitter.

Wow, today has been an incredible day. I guess I better start with last night to get to today... Last night at around 11:00 PM I went to my next door neighbor's house (she happens to be one of my very best friends) because she was having some landlord issues. Well needless to say, we were both upset and in horrible moods, but then the conversation shifted to spirituality and illness and the relation and honest to God, for a brief instant I felt no pain at all. I started crying because it was so foreign to me to have that feeling! It has been approx. 3 years since I have felt what it feels like to have zero pain. I couldn't believe it! We decided right then and there that we are going to be grateful for the blessings we have and we are going to be thankful for our trials and tribulations because without them, we wouldn't learn. We wouldn't grow as human beings... as spiritual beings. I was (I think I can speak for us both here) totally swept away with feelings of pure love and light and I could see her aura getting brighter and brighter by the minute. Normally I can't see aura's, but I could see my friend's! It was incredible.

The president would veto a measure to raise the debt ceiling if it doesn’t extend the limit into 2013, White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Daley warned that “markets around the world” would react negatively to a short-term measure offering less than $2.4 trillion in borrowing authority. “We’ve got to get past this debt-ceiling vote,” Daley said. “It’s time to get some certainty.”

We also recognise that the individual is best placed to decide for themselves what employment options are best for them. People without disabilities have that choice; to close and privatise Remploy factories is depriving disabled people of that employment choice.

Man alive, I'm getting awful at updating this. One of these days I'll just have to go through and post a whole bunch of songs. Now if I could just find the time to do that...
The first one up is the very first one I did, back in July of 2010. There were a couple videos available for "October Love Song" by Chris & Cosey, but not for the version I liked and none of the videos were very high quality. Looking back, I would rather have done a better clip but this was my experiment in how to use Windows Live Movie Maker (I taught myself along the way). It's a really simple slide show using some of my favorite artwork from the Pre-Raphaelite movement of the late 1800's. The time between picture flips is a bit long for my tastes now and it seems really primitive now but we all gotta start somewhere, no?
And although our nation has come so far, and I have truly had the chance to be inspired personally by these accomplishments, there is still work to do, bias to overcome, stereotypes to fight and racist groups to abolish, but at least the dream is still alive and I can't wait to see what the world looks like in another 20 years.
I'm slowly recovering, slowly getting back energy. S-L-O-W-L-Y. This is truly testing my patience. I want to go exercise, go to the zoo and walk around, take a trip. Heck, I just want to walk at my normal pace!
The Bar, it was clear, had heard enough from Nifong. In a devastating response to Nifong’s plea to dismiss some of the charges against him, the Bar accused the DA of asking the Disciplinary Hearings Commission “to undertake statutory construction, interpretation of case law, and semantic hair-splitting.” It ridiculed his citation of court orders from Judges Stephens and Smith, noting “that the content of each Order was based on Nifong’s misrepresentations to the Court as alleged in the Amended Complaint. Therefore, Nifong is effectively arguing that he can make false statements to a court which result in the entry of an order, and then use the order that is based on his misrepresentations to claim he committed no discovery violation.” And it correctly argued that the “Defendant’s contention that he was under no obligation to provide the information because no trial date was set necessarily implies that he was also entitled to withhold and never disclose potentially exculpatory information in any case that settled prior to trial.”

Its Pokedex entries say it moves so fast that it’s hard to see, and becomes invisible, probably due to it being the Ninja Pokemon. Despite May’s Pokedex entry in the anime, Ninjask doesn’t have increase evasion (although it does learn Double Team by level-up), and it can be hit by most attacks.
(Incidentally, Ezekiel 4:6 says to lie on your right side for an additional 40 days to bear the sin of Judah, so in all, god instructed the “son of man” from Ezekiel 4:1 to bear mankind’s sins for 400 days in all…)

So, I felt the success of this work was because I had allowed myself to become immersed in the process. As a therapist, I learned that in therapy, 'the process is everything.'' So... I'm seeing it is the same for my art, as well!
It amazes me every time I put this list together how much I have to reorganize. There’s always another item that I’ve got crossed off and moved to the bottom of the list or I can move down something else because I’ve made some serious progress on it. I have two major goals which I no longer have to even think about (everything’s planned it’s just a matter of time before our flights take off and I can seriously enjoy them!) and a few things that I’ve done all I can do for at the moment and just have to chip away at (like my loans or living situation).
My boys certainly have some after school activities, of course. I’m an American! But once I started researching “free play” for my book, I let them drop out of some, too. Goodbye piano! Goodbye electric guitar!
It feels brilliant - hugely rewarding and validating and encouraging! I learn a lot from readers... I actually changed the first chapter of The Hostage in response to reader criticisms. I'm very open to any suggestion that will improve on what I've written and sometimes younger readers offer a perspective that adults will miss.

A major lesson that I have learned is that in your own space, you can make of it what you will because it's your call. And so I've deemed my "formal living room" my official craft room. Since claiming this space a crafter's home, at first I really tried to hold on to that wallpaper. I really didn't want to invest in making too many changes, partially because I felt that as a creative person I must somehow be able to transform this space of mine without having to detour from what already existed. What I ended up feeling was major frustration. Although all my supplies were finally gathered into one space, the space did not feel like me; did not speak to me and therefore it was hard to craft in there. Another lesson learned.
I miss you all

I suppose we should discuss why you might want to add captcha to a form before we begin. Essentially a captcha’s job is to tell a human from a machine. Spam bots can and will target your forms. Apparently spreading links to improve search engine ratings is big business. Another less frequent form of spam is hawking products and services. I’m told that the targeting can be pretty indiscriminate, even spamming the lowly contact form. I even get a little in the comment section of this blog.
The Board of Discipline’s decision sends a clear and strong signal that the University does not condone such actions. At the same time, as the administrator of his scholarship, the University has separately conveyed to him that his undergraduate scholarship benefits have been terminated for the final semester as his behaviour was unbecoming of a scholarship holder.

To understand how this occurred, it is useful to review the history of the Irish and Tammany Hall, as well as the unusual political and social conditions in New York, the theater district and Manhattan’s West Side and decisions related thereto in the 1970’s which in many ways were critical to creating Hell’s Kitchen today.

It’s a story almost too painful to tell. From 1989-2003, Liberia was embroiled in a brutal civil war. Warlord Charles Taylor routinely kidnapped children, drugged them, armed them, and trained them to kill. When the war began, Morris was living at home with his family, going to school and living well—but his 11-year old world quickly fell apart. On June 3, 1990 his father, who worked as an engineer for the government, attempted to flee to a country farm. At the rebel checkpoint ominously called “God Bless You Gate” (meaning if you made it through alive, then God was with you), Morris watched as his mother, father, sister and brothers were slaughtered before his eyes, escaping only because his parents refused to identify him. Within a month the destitute orphan was caught by troops and made a child soldier. For seven years, he carried ammunition, killed people as ordered, kept drugs, and witnessed unimaginable atrocities.

Omni-dimensional dreams bless unreflective lives,
An atheist faces tragedy and yet it is marked by the altruistic (selfless sacrifice) of another human being. No longer can he consider ‘good’ a product of society because by what naturalistic teaching can he attribute to the action of someone else putting their life on the line for his own. Evolution offers no explanation.
Finally after walking for an hour the three humans came to the local grocery, where the parking lot was empty except for four cars.

Performances duly improved but results did not, which is why few foresaw their emphatic 3-0 victory over Crawley last week. That win spawned hope that the great escape may just be possible, after all. So a sell-out crowd of 5,173 bounced into Edgar Street – almost double Hereford’s average attendance for the season – with renewed belief. The majority were locals, but 1,200 came form Torquay hoping that they would be celebrating instead, as three points for the Gulls rather than the Bulls might have given them automatic promotion. As it transpired, a day of seesawing senti ments ended with disappointment for both teams.

You'd be forgiven for expecting this post to be about European baked goods - but no, it is that time of year when I have been called upon to create the impossible.
C brought 2 gallons of fresh milk to share and we made mozzarella and ricotta. I learned that the word ricotta means re-cooked – it comes from the Latin recocta, recooked, or from the French word recoquer meaning, re cook. This is because to make ricotta you reboil the whey left over after making cheese and add enough vinegar so that the last of the very fine curds separate out from the whey.

This bad boy is honestly my worst nightmare. All that spinning plastic makes me mental. BUT, parents swear it keeps their baby quiet and entertained for precious minutes. The music and motion continues for as long as 20 minutes and it even comes with a remote to allow parents to turn it off from afar after Baby has fallen asleep (or on from afar if you need to buy yourself some time?) As a sleep deprived, first time parent, I can see how all of that would be very appealing. Maybe even appealing enough for me to look past how much I don't like the way it looks...

Adding some new paint to the property is a small investment that may help it sell faster. Take a look at your property and pick out all the items that are not pleasing to the eye. Put away any small appliances. While it may be more convenient to leave that toaster out, it can make your counter look cluttered and small.
So look to your Movember man for glimpses of character. Does the moustache become him, or overwhelm him? Is he enjoying the hair and attention? Or slinking in the shadows? It’s not really about the moustache, after all. Character is everything. In Wodehouse’s world, a man can have a crooked face and a cauliflower ear, yet reign supreme. Just as it should be.
This is just a random blog to write. I'll dedicate it to my love, since he's the one made me better, in may ways, Though I'm always sick, he's always been there to make me smile. He encourages me to keep writing and to keep trying my best no matter what. He's been there, when no one else was and he still is. I cry a lot, from big things, little things, insignificant things, and pain, but he's still there talking to me and trying to make me smile all he can. He makes me strong. ^_^
The next few moments were a blur. Simultaneously, James, Emily, and William launched themselves at the Ashen girl, wildly and with the ferocity of a wolf pack. James’s knife flickered in and out of her guard, once perhaps actually hitting her. William snatched her by the arm and tried to throw a punch, but was batted out of the way by a blow from her sword-hilt. For some reason, the Ashen girl, though fully capable of killing all three with another blast of magic, seemed to be interested in taking them alive. She would have knocked William unconscious, but Emily managed a sturdy backhand blow to the face that seemed to faze the girl.
I think we have to have economic initiatives to build trade throughout Latin America, particularly with Colombia and Panama, now part of free trade agreements. I want more of that throughout Latin America. But that’s the first flaw, ignoring Latin America.

Now don't get me wrong, I didn't do a marathon (or snickers, whatever they are called now) but I did go round the block twice. Which I think is a great start. I walked a bit, I ran a bit. I didn't stop halfway round for a cigarette, (apparently that is frowned upon, who knew?) I nodded at other joggers as we went past as if we were all in some secret club together.

Students expect the classroom teacher to place greater demands upon himself. This is a message many professors do not like to hear. The contrarian dimension of my manifesto is an appeal to change our ways, as difficult as that may be for those of us further along in years.
History is replete with cases where private funds helped to bring about wonderful inventions. Take Apple, Inc. as an example. Although they benefit from IP laws, as does every other established tech firm, they’ve grown into the giant they are today by providing innovative products to willing consumers.

(Re-reading this review, I don’t think I made it clear how much I really enjoyed Anvil!. It’s one of the best documentaries I’ve seen in a long time, and certainly one of my favorite films of 2009, thus far. It doesn’t matter if you’re a metal fan or not – I’m not – it’s a terrific film, and though it will mostly be ignored or passed over theatrically, I think it’s going to enjoy a long life on DVD.)
However, I do believe that because of all the hype, there are people out there who will end their lives or the lives of others because of it. The world, as we KNOW it, will end. But not the world itself.

Now don’t get me wrong, ultimately, I have no reason to be pissed off. All of these things (in some way) I am sure are good things. But right now, I’m just kind of sitting here beating my head against my desk wondering why all things in life are so fucking difficult for me at perhaps the very last step in crossing this bridge from disaster to recovered. I guess you could call this metaphorical bridge “recovery”.
But I also had several critiques of the ad too. My entire group consisted of athletes of one form or another; several of us played sports in high school and continued to play intramurals in college and others played for school teams. Regardless, we all knew of Under Armour and used it when competing on our organized teams. We felt that Under Armour does a perfect job of reaching athletes by using pro athletes or incredibly fit athletes in their ads but what about those individuals that don’t compete in organized sports and instead, just play pick-up on the weekends with friends? They’re all in their 20-somethings, aren’t all in the best shape, and play just for fun and bragging rights. This group of people was exactly who I thought our campaign should focus on and my group agreed.

Even in our cities, places like Anchorage (where I am sitting, at present), one can see impressive natural features without having to look terribly hard. My 11th-floor hotel room has a commanding view of the Cook inlet. Not a boat in sight, either. What I love most is how the city, the most built-up, urbanized part of it, just dead-ends at the beach.

When I went to my sister's house for Thanksgiving I saw that she had picked up crochet again. I had been rolling this around in my mind too, and I had actually packed yarn and a hook for the drive (13 hours!) but discovered that I get car sick if I focus too closely on detail work or reading. {Sigh.} Lucky that the library has books for download as this makes the time FLY. The Lost Hero by Rick Riordan was entertaining for everyone. Anyway, seeing that my sister was back in crochet mode was all I needed to get myself going again. She gave me an awesome book that has stitches in it that I'll share another day.
The beauty of these pieces, especially the rugs, is that while they make a big statement, they are at home in a variety of settings, with many furniture styles. All of the rugs are hand knotted of 100% New Zealand wool and are available in a variety of sizes, including custom.
Woodwork. Oh dear. Nice teacher, old school Jack Hargreaves type and if I had my grandad's carpentry genes, maybe. But I haven't got a clue and I couldn't care less. Someone's got to make chairs and tables and desks and fucking high stools and benches I suppose, but that's not me, buster! I wasn't put on this earth to make things. Hammers, planes, chisels. I am not an artisan.

Beyond supercharging your love life, feeling thankful also can boost your health. Turns out that if you keep a gratitude journal, you’re also likely to exercise more, have fewer aches and pains, and feel more optimistic about life than if you ramble on about things that drive you crazy or don’t matter much. Even better, 15 minutes of daily gratitude can dramatically decrease stress hormones in your body.
When it comes to relationships and dating, how do you define mature? We’ve all, or most of us have experienced some type of break, a point in a relationship, or an emerging relationship (Dating) where there’s an end to things. Do you remember the old high school days where your friends or perhaps yourself would end a relationship? Yes, the day when your named got trashed or you defamed someone for the rest of their high school days. You were a teenager, you had an excuse to be dumb, naive and pretty much immature. The older you got, the more you claimed to have grown up, to have changed, to have learned from those young days.

After the merry-go-round of the past month’s fashion shows, with all their colour and noise, brilliance and bravado, it is customary to retreat with some relief to the relative normalcy of the high street, and to crave simplicity in quiet tailoring and seasonal staples. Uniqlo is one such haven: a calm, ordered arena of basics and fail-safes, well-made and affordable.

Update: I would note that Apple is in rarified air here, but it is not the first company to cross the $500 billion level; PetroChina, Exxon, Microsoft, General Electric and Cisco Systems have all visited this neighborhood before; but note that none of the others were able to hold above the magical half-billion mark. (PetroChina at one point had a valuation north of $1 trillion.)

After we went to a neighbor's house last night to bring in the New Year, we came home, got Alli situated in bed, and went to bed ourselves. Little M was quite active, so I had Dad-E see if he could feel them moving too... and he could! It was an amazing moment in the wee hours of 2012, what a way to start out the new year... both of us together feeling our little one moving around in my belly. Just wonderful.
That increases the chances that investigating judges will allow prosecutors a more detailed look at DCNS’s books to probe kickbacks in Pakistan, where 11 French submarine engineers were killed in a bomb attack, and Taiwan, where a number of murders and suicides have been recorded in connection with the sale of frigates to Taiwan’s navy. The details can be found here.
The view that the South African constitution legitimizes the race-based legal structure originates from the black governing elite: it is the political correct thing to say according to the black governing party for those subject to its policies. Affirmative action, however, can only be justified on an individual basis, that is in respect of individuals whose rights were in reality violated previously. These violated rights should be remedied by affirmative action and then only on an individual basis. Affirmative action cannot be used as justification for legitimizing a totally race-based legal system in which the beneficiaries can even be foreigners, provided that they are black, as is the case in South Africa. The purpose with the new constitution was to abolish a race-orientated legal structure, not to entrench it. If a government creates a legal structure which allows people to chant slogans openly to kill members of another race, that your job can be taken on account of your race, that your land can be expropriated on account of your race, that companies and shares can be taken over on account of the race of the owners, it is certainly one that also sends a clear message to criminals that they may attack the members of that race, who are legally regarded as untermenschen, with impunity. The structure in its totality is then oppressive against whites; the criminal consequences are just one element thereof.
He tells Lilly to take him to his hotel. On the ride he mentions Troubadour, the horse that paid 70/1, and asks her how much she got paid to let that happen. She tries to claim she was down on the horse but there was too much action and he asks "Do you want to stick to that story or do you want to keep your teeth?"
And just in case you ever wondered where I live.....this is it! This road is less than a mile from mine and I chose it because it's a nice straight stretch with a pretty desolate view. It's also near a small airstrip. I don't know why that matters, but I thought I'd tell you anyway.
When the summer is upon us, we must start looking into the trousers. Do we go long, short, bermuda or even shorter? These military green Dolce & Gabbaba denim bermuda shorts have a normal waist, (I can't abide low waist or even the ones resting curiously against all laws of physics by resting under the bum) are baggy, button down fly, multipockets and drawstring hemline. I find them quite funky, even if I am not very partial to this colour. You can buy them here at EUR 208
In the seven-year period before he came to Cal Poly, Paul Holocher served as the head soccer coach at UC Santa Cruz, Director of Soccer for Santa Cruz and its 5,000 youth players, and founded the Catalyst Soccer Club.

It is worth every penny that is asked for it (well, unless you are shopping at some yuppie gimmicky store that takes pride in gouging it's customers--I choose not to shop at these types of establishments, thank you very much!) I know that these small family farmers work hard to produce food of the highest quality and I also know that it is extremely expensive in order to be certified "organic". I am not saying that their food and products are not worth the price--I am only lamenting the fact that I am not independently wealthy enough to be able to afford to buy all of them.
The meeting tonight was held at the Prospect Park Residence. On Tuesday, a similar presentation will be made before a Community Board 2 committee, at Long Island University, Library Learning Center Room 515, DeKalb and Hudson Avenues, at 6 pm.
Jews, then, not only escaped the Nazis, or escaped Europe post-1945, and ended up in Israel; Jews also escaped the Russian communists and ended up in Israel. Jews today are also escaping IslamoNazi anti-Semitism in Holland and other European countries and are heading to Israel. And when they get there, they feel the wrath of not only IslamoNazis in Palestine, but also the wrath of anti-Semitic far leftists all over Europe and the United States.

This card is from a set of cards that came with the card base and the over layer. It's such fun to try and figure out what to do with these cards. (NOT) I first went through the whole stack and decided what over layer to put with what card base. Then I had to come up with how to decorate.

Poor choices are also the reason that a healthy animal is euthanized every two seconds in the United States. 61% of dogs and 75% of cats that end up in shelters are euthanized. Pet overpopulation is becoming an epidemic in this country because of backyard breeders and irresponsible pet owners who simply do not have their animals spayed or neutered. For each human that is born, seven puppies and/or kittens are born. Think about that for a moment. Do you think it is possible to find homes for all those animals? Of course not. Therefore, it is grossly irresponsible to refuse or neglect to have your animal spayed or neutered. This neglect amounts to mass cruelty, as millions of animals that should not even have been born die for no reason except that there is no home for them.

Say you have an old man who's grumpy and crotchety. He's always yelling at the kids to get off his lawn. Pretty cliche, right? You can almost see the prototypical old man sitting on a chair, or maybe a porch swing, in front of an old house that's badly in need of repair and a new paint job. You can see his manicured lawn, in contrast to the house, it's well cared for.. yet also a little neglected in spots. Maybe the grass is burnt in a couple of places.. the path up to his door has cement that's cracked, and there's some spots where some grass is grown through the cracks. Maybe his mailbox leans a little and has some cobwebs on it because he doesn't get any mail, not even junk mail.

A big-budget comic adaptation about six superheroes fighting to protect earth from a nasty demigod should be a ridiculous display of stock characters and confusing CGI. Instead, “The Avengers” defies your logical expectations of a Hollywood action film, giving you a brilliantly layered film that knows exactly what it’s doing. Whether or not you’re already a massive Joss Whedon fan (writer and director), prepare to bow down to his cinematic wizardry.

I kissed the base of her spine, then one of her stinging cheeks, and when she was relaxed, I hit her ass again, then again, waiting for her to relax each time, alternating the slaps with soft strokes to her ass, and then to her pussy. I’d hit her 3 or 4 times so that I knew it was stinging, then I would move lower and gently rub her wet pussy to comfort her for a minute. I made the slaps precursors to the pleasant, soothing touches. It didn’t take many choruses of that before she was squirming and breathing hard and hugging the pillow against her.

The Lie Lay Land is an album of mesmerizing patience. It was constructed with much care and much consideration, I think that is obvious, and it demands patience of the listener as well. Like all good puzzles, it requires dedication to solve, but also presents a worthwhile challenge. The oddity is that I couldn’t precisely single out any passage in any song to illustrate what I’m trying to say. The effect this music may or may not have on the listener boils down to the most minute details embedded in the songs. It’s not that a certain stretch of rhythm is particularly remarkable, it’s the little cracks that show up, expertly placed and nurtured, the tiny details which warp any sort of predictable, comfortable structure you might expect the song to settle into. And what’s more, I’m not even certain “songs” is the right word for what this record has to offer. My impression is that World’s End Girlfriend treats music in a singularly visual way. Listening to this I get flashes of color, textures superimposing and alternating, depth, all translated into sound. It’s not synesthesia I’m talking about here, it’s the feeling that this music is a sort of slowing down of light to the speed of sound. Tricky business to absorb and even trickier to put into words (which is, after all, just another form of translating, isn’t it?).
I hope all rulers will be like (his older brother) Tuanku Pahang who goes to the ground especially when the rakyat is facing an emergency. If all rulers can play this role, it’s very good for the country because the rakyat will see they have a last resort.
He has agreed to go to the Dr on Monday. She wants him to go for a "second opinion" in the hopes that he can at least accept some help with pain management. I hope to God and all that's holy he will comply. None of us are doctors and without some kind of professional assessment we don't know what to do other than be kind. Night before last was a bad night and he did reveal he has lots of pain all the time. He had denied it up until then. The key to selling this idea was that he had only seen one doctor, not gotten any treatment and since doctor's are human perhaps a mistake was made. Seems he's gotten quite heavy with a belly and his face is puffy. He can't hold anything down and falls down regularly. I hope it isn't cancer and that somehow he has imagined that's what he has. I don't expect that's true but I sure would love to see him proven wrong in this case.
“John, please,” I said, not wanting to argue or fuss over something so insane on this last morning, “let's just separate the bag and that'll be our goodbye. You've bought my last fix outta this place. That's a nice enough memory, no? Our goodbye we'll say in words or a hug.... not blood.”

Also we’re holding a Chrome Kids party in Buffalo Bar, Cardiff this Thursday (January 19th) with a bunch of our favourite DJs and Producers, all the info’s on the flyer above. It’s going to be the first time in over a year that I’ve got to see Stagga play (bedroom DJing not included) and not seen Monky since Electric Sheep last year so really looking forwards to it. Also Jauge is a fairly new artist who I’m yet to see play, I’ll post one of his new tunes below with the new free release that Falcon Lake gave us recently.

When do your pieces begin for you? With an image? A sentence? A concept? Or do you just sit down with your pencil and start to write. I think this is stemming from a knee-jerk assumption that a piece of flash fiction may not require the same amount of planning as a longer piece might. Is this correct?
“The Zionist zealots (neo-conservative Likud Party supporters who yoke Israel's interests to those of America) and rightwing evangelical "millennial" or end-time Christians, both raise the spectre of "Islamic terrorism" as a force that threatens free people everywhere. They know that fear destroys reason, leaving the individual's conscience in the hands of those who instill the fear. Similarly, Fascism and Zionism achieved their objectives through fear, resulting in the vast societal FEAR syndrome.”

With regard to the cover, I see that the book is to be published soon by 'Busted Flush' in the United States and that they have gone for an altogether different piece of artwork. I hope that in the same way that they've improved the way it looks, they'll give it a thorough proof-read and correct some of the mistakes. It's a small gripe, I know, but there are a large handful of errors in the production that should have been ironed out by someone at Max Crime. It shouldn't put anyone off buying their copy, but there are a few breaks in the author's fine flow that didn't need to be there.

“This is unfair for the yes camp, red is obviously more striking than green and will surely give an added advantage to them especially during their campaigns. green is hardly noticable and does not have any spark in it.” A blogger reacts.
Teaching to mastery also instills self-confidence in students because they learn they are capable of learning whatever new skills or material the teacher presents.Students who are immersed in mastery, in all subjects for at least three years, will become much smarter than comparable students taught in a traditional manner. Mastery-taught students will not only know more—these students will be far more proficient and faster at learning new academic material of any kindNancy pointed as prevalent in some schools and even homes and what Englemann denounces? It may not be like this everywhere, but I was THAT teacher, I made THOSE questions, and I believe I was part of a system where spiral and traditional (described by Englemann as non teaching to mastery) teaching prevailed. As for my homeschool, I'd try to do things differently.

The demo is sparse vocally with growls making an appearance in tracks 2 and 3 only. They add a more aggressive element beyond the music itself which gives a hard edge to the aforementioned theme of melancholy of each song.

That's right, S.E. Hinton, the author of The Outsiders (considered by many to be the forefather (forebook?) in the YA genre), will be at the Princeton Barnes & Noble tonight at 7pm. And yes, I'm well aware that Hinton has written many other works--but The Outsiders is the most awesome. As a book and a movie.
Christy and Julia are 43 and 45, respectively, so let's get real. In fact, some of us might feel a bit outraged that Lancôme dropped the stunning Isabelle Rosselini as the face of Lancôme at 40, for being too old, and picked up Julia for the same when she was older than that. One might think that's a step in the right direction, but not when Julia still looks under 30 in the ads. When does touching up turn into complete fabrication?

That was something Obama, in his own self-assessment, deeply wanted to avoid. He said he would never keep a job just for security. In early December, after one year at Business International, he quit. He also left the apartment on 114th Street and moved in with Genevieve. It was to be a temporary arrangement until he left for Hawaii over the Christmas holidays. When he returned, he would find another place of his own, he said. Their time living together did not go well.

These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.
