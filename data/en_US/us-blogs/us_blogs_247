Why shouldn't we, as a people, decide that education is more important than killing? That tax dollars are in our power to decide how to spend, that anything coming from the government is not truly a "hand-out" but a choice of how to spend our tax dollars for the collective good?

This is purely for vanity. I don't think it will magically make you get your pre-pregnancy body back. BUT it will have that flabby belly that for some reason you thought would just disappear after you pushed your little bundle out. Well unless you are amazing (I will hate you if you say you were one of these people) you now have a what could be 5-6 month post pregnancy belly that is now all deflated because there is no baby in there anymore! When you have your new baby appointments, put this on under your clothes. It will make you feel better about your body. You will LOOK skinnier even though it's just an illusion. Of course you could buy any type of corset type thing to essentially do the same thing but this is the "namebrand" one so it's the one I used.

More than 70 people packed the selectmen’s room at town hall Wednesday night to watch a meeting that lasted less than 10 minutes, according to The Enterprise. Unlike most of the selectmen’s meetings over the past six months, Cohasset Town Manager Michael Coughlin did not sit at a table next to the board members. Instead, he stood next to his wife a few feet in front of the first row of spectators. In a unanimous vote, the selectmen stated their intent to dismiss Coughlin after just six months as town manager. Coughlin has been suspended with pay until the selectmen take a final vote whether to fire him, which will take place in at least 30 days. Coughlin is not allowed on town hall property without prior notice. The selectmen, in accordance with the Town Manager Act for Cohasset, signed a resolution to remove Coughlin without cause. The board cited a difference in communication styles as the reason for Coughlin’s termination. The selectmen and Coughlin “do not share in common the same views as to how important manners should be communicated or as to the most effective manner in which those matters should be handled,” the resolution states. Selectman Diane Kennedy was the only member of the board to elaborate on the decision, implying that Coughlin tried to sully the reputation of other town officials. After the selectmen’s meeting, Chairman Edwin Carr met with dozens of residents and town employees in the town hall’s auditorium because some people wanted to voice their displeasure with the resolution to remove Coughlin. Coughlin and other residents will be able to address the issue during a public hearing March 13. The Town Manager Act allows the outgoing official to request a public session before selectmen make a final decision. Douglas Louison, Coughlin’s attorney, said his client Tuesday filed a request for a leave of absence under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. However, Louison said Coughlin’s request – which gives employees 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave – will not be accepted by the town because federal law requires that the person making the request must have worked for their employer for at least 12 months.

Colors I used: Regal Rose, Almost Amethyst (ret.), Daffodil Delight, Bashful Blue, Wild Wasabi for the stamped images, and cardstock. I also used Melon Mambo, Basic Black (on one), Ballet Blue (ret.), and More Mustard for some of the sentiments to bring up the color and accents a little more.

In August 2011 I found myself in a position I really had very little experience with. I was unemployed, and I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I was done with working in big companies, after some 14 years of corporate life. In November after an experience with my dog I had an idea, and started researching what I needed to do to start my own business. I had plans to start in January of 2012, and was going to use the last weeks of 2011 to get my business started. During this time, I was referred to CEED to a class called Start Smart.

I continue to pray for the patience to wait for the vision that you have given me. However, I must work while I wait, and I pray for both inspiration and motivation to do so. As I follow you through reading Scriptures and meditating on them, as well as through prayer, I ask for guidance by your Spirit, for direction in my life. Let me know what I am to be doing during this time. If you have shown me, then open my eyes so that I may see it.

Speaking of range, Marshevet Myers hasn’t long jumped since her collegiate days when she sprinted and jumped at Texas. Her 22’ 6” leap at the Tyson Invitational gave her the #2 mark on the season and moved her into #4 all time American indoors. Already a major threat to make the US team in the 100 meters, Myers is starting to look like a threat in the long jump as well as only Brittney Reese among current US long jumpers is in that class. It will be interesting to see if she continues jumping during the outdoor campaign.

I first contacted the clinic in the summer of 2010 and by the fall we were invited to go to an information session regarding IVF. After we attended the information session they told us the wait time to be offered treatment was between 4-5 months. It actually took us 1 year and 2 months for treatment to be offered. I eventually found out the reason for this was because I was not calling in my period which they require you to do so to stay on there waiting list. I have PCOS and do not get a period so it took at least 4 months of them not calling before I called them to ask them where we were on the list. Low and behold we were at the bottom and the lady explained if I wouldn’t have called I would never have been offered treatment. I explained to them my situation and I was put on birth control so I could call in my cycle and ensure my spot on the list. After that my tests (HSG, Blood Work) all had expired so I was benched again waiting to complete tests for treatment. This took the rest of the year and finally we were called in for treatment.
While it’s not a straight-forward memoir, Patriot allows us more than a passing glimpse into Vowell’s inner space. We learn why she likes the Underground Lunchroom and why she feels that Clinton could learn a thing or two from Nixon. She makes no bones about her nerdiness, her love of America and it’s history, and her eager embrace of the online political community - if only because it lets her vent to like minded people. (Which is really why we all like it, right?)
It’s surprising how different it feels to have our Governor give a speech where all of the statements make sense and the ideas flow logically from one to the next. Where the national media doesn’t deconstruct every statement, and where it’s clear there’s no major hidden agenda relating to his career. In short, a cogent speech, the focus of which is Alaska and not the speaker.

Now before anyone freaks out in the comments section, I'm not saying that all or even most priests and monks are gay. It stands to reason, though, that the Church was ironically one of the only refuges for gay people to avoid sleeping with the opposite sex and living a lie. It may be that the ritual of adelphopoiesis was a way to bond two men in a lifelong relationship that was superficially religious in nature, while everyone in the monastery was giving the pair a sly wink, knowing what was really going on.

The image below was another practice piece. It was some brickwork which I don't think turned out too badly. I realize that I need to space the bricks closer together and on the edges where it was pretty much obliterated the instructions were to use your soft brush and fade it. Well, either my paint was still to wet, my brush was too wet or I used to much pressure because I pretty much erased it. Another lesson learned.
That's why in 2006, Bavaria issued Dutch fans with orange trousers with 'Bavaria' written on them. It was a cheeky bit of guerilla marketing, and Fifa decided they didn't like it. The Dutch fans were told they had to strip and watch the game trouserless, or go home. This astonishing infringement of human rights became headline news, giving Bavaria infinitely more free marketing than if paying fans had just been allowed to wear what they liked to watch their national team. When I googled 'Budweiser World Cup' later that year, the first page of hits were all newspaper articles and blogs criticising Fifa's bully boy tactics on behalf of Budweiser. The official Bud site was way down the page.

In the final quarter there is a lot of pseudoreligious commentary that sometimes borders on platitude. Couple this with the imperialistic and exploitative free market approach of the protagonists and it sometimes makes uncomfortable reading. The religious philosophising in particular, though made integral to the nature of the story as the characters go on personal journeys, becomes wearisome. But this was the product of its time not written by a radical like H.G. Wells but a member of high society in a free market world of American Exceptionalism and Christian imperialism.

Joseph Leidy had written several articles about the earliest finds of Plesiosaurs in North America, and one of them was the disputed 'Discosaurus' in Alabama, possibly originating from the same beds as 'Zueglodons' (Basilosaurus). He was writing in the 1850s and one of the comparable early finds was from the Greensands of New Jersey, thought to have been of Late Cretaceous age. The specimens in this case were named 'Cimoliasaurus'; however, some of them turned out to be cetacean vertebrae of probably Pliocene age, probably some sort of a dolphin.

From the word 'go', it point blank refuses to conform to any normal standards of characterisation, classification, or type.

I don't claim to have the answers to what you choose to appreciate or how to get to a place that feels better than this. I only know that I don't want to get "sucked in" to the drama of what feels like endless debates in politics and on the news. So I'm turning the channel again! Besides, I can't escape "the news." I hear it from people around me, when I sign onto the internet, from Facebook and Twitter notifications and I don't live in a cave! But I do choose not to internalize all of this: this is an opportunity for me to know what I really want for me, my life, my community, my country and my world.

I read a ton and it was very hard to choose my FAVORITE! I ended up cookie-ying Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Winnie-the-Pooh for a couple of reasons. The first one is simple: I AM A COMPLETE Harry Potter NERD! Even though I'm a muggle I know a little bit too much about the wizarding world and J.K. Rowling's vocabulary tends to slip into my everyday conversation, earning me either a confused look or a look that says unmistakably, "Wow, you're a real nerd aren't ya?" So yes! Today I celebrated my HP obsession by painting the cover of my favorite book of the series on a cookie with food coloring. Me? a nerd?... okay, guilty!

It cannot be said that the Path of Probation lasts for any given amount of time…not an hour, a day, or a year. It is thus futile to seek to put Probation within a specific window or amount of time. This is oftentimes done incorrectly for there are those who do not feel comfortable and secure unless they have a specific and definite time slot for everything. They want to know when everything is going to occur, how it is going to occur, and why. While one is busy keeping all such information going on and alive in their mind, one easily overlook the importance of what is taking place of the event one is incessantly seeking to time.

So what's going on in my head at this hour? I have to admit that just now its mostly work-related. Not surprising I suppose, as its all still fairly new, but this new (part-time!!) job does seem to have taken over my entire life. I'm assuming the work-life balance bit will level out soon?
I became totally fixated with learning how to bead in this style, specifically the Peyote stitch. Within a very short time, I'd amassed a collection of Japanese seed beeds, silk threads and wax. And the tiniest, thinnest needles you ever saw. I pored over issues of Bead & Button magazine and taught myself as much as I could. I knew a lot of my work wasn't so good but I kept going because it was so much more fun to make things then to actually wear them.
That night, Bong Sook goes on and on about how much Anna sticks to Young Gul while Ga Young simply keeps drawing, her strokes getting more furious with each word Bong Sook says. Then Bong Sook asks where she spent the last night, guessing it was probably Jae Hyuk. Ga Young tells her she’ll be back in a bit and heads to Young Young. She gets a shock when she reaches there. Her bed is gone. She turns to the sounds coming from Young Gul’s office where he’s on the phone. Whoever he’s talking to, Young Gul calls Anna ‘cool’. As he’s heading out in the middle of the call, he sees Ga Young and hangs up, asking her why she’s here. She makes an excuse and explains nothing happened last night and it was just that she drank too much. Such stuff can happen, right? Then she tears up and her voice breaks as she asks him why he had to make it sound so degrading? She’s not his woman and he’s not her boyfriend. Young Gul simply laughs it off before telling her he has to go out now. She asks if he won’t even give her a little bit of time and he retorts, “Lee Ga Young and I? Do we have something to talk about anymore?”
‘I felt degraded but, at the same time, I was hooked on the excitement and craved attention’ Becky’s story is all the more alarming as she is not only from a loving home, but also a good student who achieved As and Bs at GCSEs.

The reason for the agile growth in the industry could be based on a number of causes. Firstly the technological advancements in avionics enabled airplanes to be more durable and efficient. This allowed traveling longer distances with lover unit costs. Secondly air transportation became more convenient due to increased safety and flight standards. Also global economics has a very significant effect on air transportation. The rise in the overall disposable income levels caused many people from different areas of the world to travel on airplanes with intentions to explore business and leisure opportunities. The act of deregulation, open-sky agreements, trade unions and specific agreements among governments opened new and unintended markets for airlines. Another reason is that the deregulation also managed to lower airfares by enabling competition in the industry. Customers responded to the overall decrease in ticket price levels by increasing demand for air transportation. We can name globalization among the most significant reason for the increase in air transportation. The effects are reciprocal. Both globalization and air transportation benefited significantly from this process.
And if I dream in a really crazy way I would hope to live in a new city every 2 months for 2 years. That would be my ideal coo coo la la lifestyle.

Each year feels like the gap to have kids gets smaller and smaller and the anxiety inside gets bigger and bigger. I don't know if I'll ever be ready for my dream of motherhood to come. Although, I do want it real bad... someday. Especially with that boy of mine. He's pretty much the greatest.

Both the Egyptian poem I found and Song of Songs are poetic celebrations of a young girl’s spontaneous love with a strong connection to the sensuous in nature and include the use of perfume. In the Egyptian poem she draws the man to her with water against her body and the symbol of the red fish and a mention of being drenched with a fragrant unguent. In Song of Songs, the woman’s voice similarly draws the man with a subtlety and mystery to her allurements. She compares herself to a garden with choice fruits for the lover to feast. And says…

The craft had skidded to a halt next a gas station, part of me inwardly smiled at the thought of aliens jumping out and complaining they just wanted to fill up and buy a soda before going on to Mars or Jupiter. The naval officers I was in the middle of had looks of pure concentration and crept towards the craft as if it might attack them, a disturbingly possible thought since humans had done their best to bring it down. Righteous indignation flooded my mind, what I had just witness was the arrival of advanced sentient beings from another star system and the first thing we humans do was try to kill them. It was one last bit of old-fashioned innocence that along with many other things were about end.

A Dutch decision in August 2011 (Heineken NV v Olm Brouwerijen NV) may, however, strike a word of warning to SCPs as the Court in this case found an alternative way to hold a third party liable for the filling of branded containers. Heineken brought a claim of trade mark infringement against a small Dutch brewer, Olm, for the filling of Heineken casks (bearing the HEINEKEN mark) with Olm beer and the sale of such casks to wholesalers and independent retailers. Whilst, as might be expected, the sale of Heineken casks by Olm was held to infringe Heineken's trade mark, the filling of Heineken's casks did not. Instead Olm was found liable under the doctrine of ‘profiteran van wanprestatie’—benefiting as a third party from a breach of contract.

Classes went well today too, though there were significantly fewer of them. Aural skills was boring (our teacher is pretty awful), and I had my salad for lunch directly afterward.

Creative nonfiction sells, but it also feeds our need for wisdom in a culture that increasingly rejects the ponderous methods of the past. Perhaps traditional philosophy is a relic, queer but interesting like old churches, dead languages, or monastics wearing habits on the street. But its focus remains. As long as people live, suffer, and die, we will have question, and will cling to the words that seem to answer them.

For the simple shrimp marinade, toss the shrimp with the salt, pepper, cayenne and lemon juice in a resealable large bag or in a bowl. Refrigerate for 15-20 minutes.
After that, I had to have two separate detailed conversations with customers about why we call Last Call and stop serving drinks before two o'clock. Of course in this case with these types of customers it's always my fault, even though not serving alcoholic beverages after 2 am in the state of California is a STATE LAW. Explaining a state law to a drunk person is usually a waste of time. They only hear the word "NO" and not the logical rationale behind it. Eventually you just have to walk away from those types of customers.
Sugar cookies might seem ordinary to you, but these, my friends, are not ordinary.
Although this outcome frightened me, for I was at an impressionable age, I didn't have too much sympathy for the demon's victim. It seemed to me, even back then, that it was his own fault for meddling with the forces of darkness, for aligning himself with the Devil. I grew up as a Christian and I was a truly devout child, utterly convinced that God existed and that his power was without limit of any kind. I assumed that omnipotence meant power without a single restriction. I was blissfully ignorant of the clever arguments of philosophers such as Anselm and Leibniz, who showed there must be a logical limit even to God's power (God, for instance, can't reduce his own power; that option is denied to him). As far as I was concerned, God could snap his fingers, if he chose, and the Devil would vanish into nothingness instantly. God could make time run backwards, cancel out something that had already happened, violate logic in any way he liked. God could do anything.
‘Well, you remember the year before last when we had all those storms, and thunder and lightning, and water, and all the stuff we planted got washed away, and we didn’t have enough to eat, and it was awful, and Nugg and Pugg and Fugg died, and we had to bury ‘em in the back of the cave?’

Part of the email I received from Constance, on behalf of the brewer:
Healthy belief: I can share anything I feel like, because my work does not define me as a person.
And I thought I would take the opportunity to have a little moan about pub names. You may have noticed it as a thread in some postings: some pub names are strange and wonderful; some are run-of -the-mill. But it seems little enough to expect the pub website to explain the name. And yet few of them do: too busy describing the food and the quiz nights.
I drew these in my Copic Sketchbook, with a 0.03mm multiliner, no pencil. Some of the finest lines did not show up when scanned, but these were really rough sketches/studies anyways.
I’ve also noticed that you have a better chance of lowering your bill if you talk to them online than if you talk to them on the phone. One reason could be the tone you give out when you speak. When you’re chatting online, they don’t know whether you’re mad, happy, scared, and so on. On the phone, if they hear that you’re angered, they themselves might get agitated and refuse to help you as much.

During that half hour I thought fast. My paté was made of pork, so the obvious accompaniment would be an apple flavour. Thankfully I had a bottle of cider brandy lurking on the kitchen top. I resolved to sear the paté in a little very hot fat, then pour on some brandy. The alcohol would evaporate rapidly, leaving a lingering cidery, brandyish aroma to complement the meat. At least, it would had not some unnamed, accursed drunkard drained the bottle previously. Assessment time again. Jack, I decided, would check the larder, which in a Sheffield terraced house is known as the ‘cellar head’ – the shelves at the top of the basement steps. A swift reconnaissance of this yielded some cherry vodka I made last year. I swept the fruit bowl and discovered an orange. Working on the logic that it gets very hot and so makes great roast potatoes, I heated goose fat in a thick-bottomed frying pan. I added a little vegetable oil too, in case my logic proved flawed. The paté would have to cook fast, and without sticking to the bottom, for this to work. Once the fat began to smoke I turned the block of paté into the pan and seared it on both sides, keeping it moving. Then I squeezed orange juice on and around it, followed by a decent amount of cherry vodka. The result was wonderful – a nicely-browned piece of paté, and a deep-fruity reduction with a bit of bite. I guess a chef might call this a jus, but I feel more comfortable with the term sauce, for such a quotidian dish.
And, I'm guest posting at Tiffany's, from Living Savvy today. She's got a fun Spraypainter's Anonymous Series, so go check it out. I promise it's more than just mindless ramblings.
Like all Cleveland-area artists, Marian aspired to have her works shown in the Cleveland Museum of Art's prestigious May Show. I found out when I checked the museum's database that she succeeded with four works: In 1948, she showed a zebra sculpture; in 1949, she showed "Spring Night" and a zebra; in 1950, she showed "The Champ." (Her son, my bro-in-law, had a painting in the 1960 May show; her daughter, my sis-in-law, had a textile design in the 1959 show.)
One of the things that popped to mind while reading was how big a kick I got from the scene where Locke tries on the uniform. It’s always a pleasure to see him work the details and such, and I’m pretty certain the Archon was duly impressed, although his reaction was minimal. He has the file, so of course he knows Locke is good, but I don’t think he realised just how good.
As you read over the quotation about patience, remember that it may help to remember that Calvin struggled with outbursts of anger his whole life…
I would love to tell you we are knee deep in snow here in Western Idaho, but alas (and with a sigh) we are severely lacking in the white stuff. Some would tell you this is a very good thing indeed. To those who despise snow, I say "humbug!"

This is just the beginning of the use of iCloud. iTunes on the Cloud is currently beta, and we can hope to see the magic in action sometime this fall (maybe September). And mind you, all this iCloud service comes to you at no cost. Yes, it's completely free. This might make Google unhappy, as we wait to hear about their pricing for their cloud-based-service - Google Music.
So remember.....my little battle with my husband and the toiletries? Well I received so many lovely suggestions and truly thoughtful feedback from you...it was wonderful.
We have started the cloth diapering - part time around here. Punkin is wearing one as I type. He seems to like them or doesn't notice a difference, but I think he does because he danced his little tushie off right after I put the first one on him. Apparently before he got to wear them he thought they were for Sissy hehe I tricked him good huh?

Yet he rightly responds that for any Christian, “pessimism should always be provisional.” So in his last chapter he very briefly proposes four factors that could lead to the “recovery of Christianity.”
Thanks to my school, I got a chance to visit the BMW Studio, Connaught Place and catch a glimpse of the BMW Vision EfficientDynamics concept car. It was a real treat to the eyes. Futuristic, efficient and environment-friendly. I hope it hits the road soon (the folks at BMW promised so). The sad part – it costs a shit ton.

Take the ancient words of Isaiah with you. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.” Oh, to know the mind of God! But of this I'm sure - the pain of your heart is no surprise to your Maker. He embraced it Himself.
“Goodbye Simmons,” he said to my back.
Behind the altar is an impressive carved marble reredos, flanked by Victorian statues of Mary and St. John, gazing at the figure of Jesus depicted in stained glass in the east window. This dates from relatively recent times, after the original was destroyed by an incendiary bomb exploding at the railway station during the Second World War. The beautifully crafted 14th century stone work of the south wall, with piscina and sedilia, survived desecration by the Luftwaffe, but shows signs of violence from an earlier age. Intricately carved figures in the tracery either side of the ogee arches of the arcade are all headless – the result of post Reformation Puritanism which saw such depictions as idolatrous.
But if that's what it takes to praise You
Here's the card I made for the midway reminder:
But wait. Less than ten seconds into the ending credits, Dominika Petrova, House’s wife, unlocks the apartment door and walks in. She flicks on the lights and announces to House that she has returned. She has some wonderful good news. She announces that not only does she love House and wants to continue to be his wife, but she is pregnant with his child.

However, a current study being conducted by Robert P. Merges, demonstrates that this viewpoint is mostly wrong - patents have not killed the software industry, they have not led to a slowdown in entry, and they appear to have had a negligible impact, if any, on industry structure.
Stop it! Right this minute, young lady. Today is NOT the day to be doing this to yourself, if you know what I mean. You are soooooo NOT skinny today. I'm pretty sure I saw you eat an entire carton of ice cream last night. In fact, you could easily be mistaken for a beached, bloated whale. So why would you even try? You really DO hate yourself, don't you?!
There was lots of applause from the audience and both boy and dog were showered with attention. And I was one very proud mummy.
(I know "literally" is a very overused word these days, excuse me....)
Had Sergio Leone seen Roberts bowl, Clint Eastwood would probably never have become the star that he is today. Roberts was the gun slinging cowboy of the cricketing world, intimidating batsmen with those penetrating and expressionless eyes. He was the first of the great Caribbean quicks, who helped West Indies dominate world cricket for over two decades. By the time, he joined Packer’s circus in 1977; Roberts was already one of the best in the world having taken 103 wickets in just 20 Tests at 22.56 as well as 17 wickets in 9 ODIs at 15.00. His pace was all about timing and accuracy and had no room for any showmanship. According to him, the measure of a good bowler was the wickets he took and not the bones he broke.
Moving through the rest of the museum, I continued to experience a wide array of emotions. In a section discussing the various caricatures assigned to African Americans, I first experienced a sense of surprise at my unwitting ignorance of the fact that Aunt Jemima, the Cream of Wheat icon, and other popular commercial icons can be perceived as racist since they depict the stereotypes of the black servant. I had honestly never even thought about that before. I also was particularly struck by an area discussing Jim Crow legislation that had actual laws from various states spelled out on a wall around the displays while a voice-over narrates some of the ridiculous mandates. At another point, I remember feeling shocked when looking at postcards and fishing lures depicting African American babies as “Alligator Bait.” Disgusting. I didn’t even know they made racist fishing lures, but I soon learned that there is a racist version of just about every item that you can want. It is amazing how much effort some people will expend in order to create a racist item; I mean, most fishing lures that represent fish or frogs or worms or crayfish are not anywhere near as intricate and detailed as some of those I saw on display. Crazy. Finally, while much of the journey through the museum shows the atrocities of racism, a few of the final exhibits do promote the hope for healing and progress. Here, the displays celebrate the accomplishments of countless African Americans and show examples of individuals working toward equality.
They were a success, nice and chocolatey and not too sweet. In fact next time I make them I would be tempted to add a little more sugar……..there’s always the possibility that I forgot to put any in at all…….but I don’t think so. But if so - it’s my age !!

BUT, I grew up in a lilly white suburb of a sunbelt city. “Pinko commie” was how my HS classmates often taunted me. I went to college in the mid west. I’ve lived in European cities too. But, when we got the offer to come here, I sort of made peace that it is my destiny to be a bright light of minority thinking and being in a sea of Sarah Palin’s “real America.” But that is a fantasy too, the “real America.” There are interesting folks and quriks and interstitial moments everywhere.
These two girls cross paths many times and we can see they both are forming a friendship even though they trust no one. Can they become friends and help each other recover from their pasts?

What are some of these infallible proofs? From our text in Acts 1:3, the Lord was seen of them forty days. Indeed it was not a once off thing. While we are thinking of the Lord being seen I would have us consider just a moment, what Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15:4-8:
-When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everyone will respect you.

If all goes well, I may brew it again some point soon, but with a few slight changes such as using a wild yeast strain or adding more flavourings (ginger might be nice??), but lets see how its goes first. My next batch of home brew is looking like its going to be just a basic English bitter (oooooh yes, I really know how to make things exciting :P) but I'm gonna try a few variations on what hops and grains I use so it makes it a tad more special. Right...enough of me banging on. To the beer!!

Remember that this President casts himself as being pro-human rights. Joining the U.N. Human Rights Council was one of his first foreign policy moves. Who else is on this "human rights" council? His pals, the Chinese. There are no conditions for membership and the usual so-called "reform" efforts to institute such conditions, crashed and burned a year ago, which means membership includes the Chinese, the Russians, the Saudis and other illustrious human rights exemplars.

One thing I’ve been struggling with since being diagnosed with Celiac’s Disease is my weight fluctuates up and down. I grew up playing sports through college and was always very health, ate right and never really had to watch what I ate. Now with Celiac’s Disease, I find it a constant struggle. I shy away from many of the pre-mixed boxed products due to ingredients I am just not comfortable ingesting, but as of late I have gained more weight.

I left school at 18 and got a job as a messenger girl on a national newspaper, which eventually offered me an apprenticeship as a junior reporter. The Deputy Editor, David Nathan, was in charge of training, and he taught me how to write clear, accurate and punchy English. I owe him a great deal.

"As you may have guessed, this machine is for the purpose of increasing the length of the path of the particles in any liquid or solid body -- a sort of stretching machine. Every particle has its own period of vibration, and to increase the length of the vibratory path one must get into tune with the vibration, so to speak. If one tries to increase the length of the swing of a pendulum, he must move his hand at the same speed and vibration as the pendulum. If we can push the particles in some way in their path so as to increase the length of their paths, we will reach the point where the size and speed of the particles will cause them to become invisible."

I know, easier said than done. It doesn't help that I spend two hours of each weekday commuting (yes, I am great friends with the 405). But when you want to do something, when you're chasing the thing you love doing, you just have to suck it up. Figure out how much time you need every day to write or create and squeeze it out of your schedule. It could mean giving things up. Honestly though, if you're not willing to sacrifice time spent watching TV or sleeping or playing video games here and there, it's probably not something you are crazy about doing. I mean, I have time to exercise. I could easily fit that into my schedule. I could get up thirty minutes earlier or take a run when I get home from work, but I don't want to make time for it.
On the whole, I am blessed with very good editors. I have had only a couple of copy editors (in around 130 books) who really botched things. One I had to have fired; there was no option. We went back to the unedited text and started again with a new copy editor. Most have improved the books, and several have spotted errors that might otherwise have got through to press. Of course, there are still errors in my books - and they are my responsibility, not the copy editor's responsibility. (It's like children - when they do well, it's their own doing; when they do badly, we blame ourselves.)

I've coloured the image with promarkers and flexmarkers and added my little Viva pearl dots as usual. I've used Bazzill thread to 'stitch' the bunting, adding a Hobby House pearl brad at each side. The big pink flower (under the image) is from a bag of Craftwork Cards chipboard shapes I've had for ages - I painted it with acrylic paint, distressed it a bit and then sprayed with 'spray & sparkle'. The pink hearts are 'waste' pieces from a Memory Box border die and the pink rose is from my stash.
Since Midnight Commander is free and available for virtually all versions of Linux, learning to use it now will put you a step ahead for the day when you get sick of being seen as a cash cow by Apple, and are ready to move on to a computer that runs Linux. Ubuntu Linux in particular has finally matured to the point that it is actually usable by non-geeky types, and the vast majority of the software in the Linux world is still free. I like free software, and I don’t like watching the “spinning beach ball of death” on my Mac Mini, so unless someone gives me a newer one as a gift or something (not likely), the Mac Mini I’m using now is probably going to be the last Mac I will ever own.
The Police too have been unwittingly seduced and have been known to kneel in strict observance in reverence to this unholy religion. The ordinary Policeman or Women? Well theirs is not to question why or they will face a disciplinary board faster than their feet can touch the ground.
Addy is sure about one thing; she wants to sock it to All American Insurance Company where it hurts the most – their pocket. God knows they have cheated so many of her worthy clients over the years.

Dearborn’s $28.2 million Intermodal Passenger Rail Station is fully funded through the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which allocated the money to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program.

My limited experience is backed up by the lack of advertising here, which in England is an important part of TV revenue.

The conflict between generations is nothing new as this painting shows with the daughter apparently being a follower of the Arts&Crafts Movement. This was a time when William Morris was seen as edgy rather than representative of stuffy middle-class middle-England. Shows where today’s edgy will be in a couple of centuries time.
Nothing is more shameful than the attempt of law makers to by-pass the provisions of Constitution. Earlier there were a tendency of political parties to appoint large number of ministers popularly called ‘Jumbo Ministry’, to accommodate everyone.In fact there was a Hindi movie titled ‘Aaj Ka MLA Ram Avatar’ (Today’s Member of Legislative Assembly). In that movie the Chief Minister appoints all the legislatures of his party and supporters as his Deputy Chief Ministers, as he had promised everyone in exchange of supporting him as Chief Minister. But all the Deputies had no Portfolios. He retained all the portfolios.
Here’s my take on this sketch! This sketch was was a little tricky for me, but overall it has a fun whimsy to it.
It would be forever
This is far from the X-ray of current-recession-era America that some of its champions claim it to be—but, taken as a romantic comedy-drama with never-fully-realized aspirations to topical relevance, it has its undeniable pleasures. George Clooney, as a frequent flyer whose profession is basically firing people, once again turns on the charisma (perhaps to the detriment of exploring the darker sides of his character). And Vera Farmiga, as his love interest, has never been more foxy onscreen—mostly because her previous directors (Martin Scorsese among them) have used her more for her ability to project desperation than Barbara Stanwyck-like sensuality. Folks, she had me melting in my seat!

The manual searching and comparison of fired bullets and cartridge cases became an impossible task to manage. There simply wasn’t enough manpower or time to analyze those exhibits according to the established protocols. A Canadian firm, Walsh Automation, offered a solution and soon every ballistic lab in the country had an automated system installed, known as IBIS (short for ‘Integrated Ballistic Identification System’).

The evidence Prof. P. offers for his claims concerns attitudes. What students say about their views is the foundation of his theory.

A self-selecting list helps to prevent you from sending to the spam boxes of readers who never add you to their contacts or who simply mark you as spam to get rid of the unwanted emails. On the bright side, these passive sign-ups may be a turning point, bringing in loads of readers who definitely want what you have! It’s up to you to know if that is the case for your newsletter.
While the premise may not sound like the best setup for a comedy, the script strays away from the doom and gloom of this lost spark and provides plenty of humor. There are sex talks, some quirky situational comedy, a little crying, and even awkward dancing from these film icons. Based on the trailer, the most interesting aspect of the humor of this film is that it seems that Streep and Jones cause much of the laughter while funny-man Carell plays the straight man. The Office obviously has great comedic timing so I hope the scripts gives him something to work with.
Detective Miller is looking for a girl. One girl in a system of billions, but her parents have money and money talks. When the trail leads him to The Scopuli and rebel sympathizer, Holden, he realizes that this girl may be the key to everything.
But what is "good will"? It seems to me that it could either mean "good" in the virtuous sense of the word, or, more specifically, Catholic. In either case, it expresses a profoundly anti-Christian sentiment. The notion that only moral or Christian people deserve peace and our prayers is anathema to everything Jesus ever taught. There is simply no sound reason for abandoning "love your enemies" simply because it’s closer to the Latin. The original Greek text recognizes this, and expresses "goodwill to all people." Ironically, the Latin is then actually a mistranslation of the Greek. This just highlights the fact that the possibility of human error doesn’t disappear when writing church texts. It’s hard to see what inherent reason we have for respecting this highly fallible process.

Sadly, we are no strangers to the concept of re-recording. To date every single recording we've done as a band has been scraped at least once and then re-done. It's an ugly streak but at the end of the day we rather have our record come out 6 months later than have a finished product we are unsatisfied with. Sometimes these things happen for a reason.

While Teagan cried, I got Ashlin in, the stroller away, then went back to Teagan and sat in front of her, at her eye level. I asked her to stop crying and to listen to me. That she can’t go running into the road, that she needs to listen and be a good girl or she won’t get to go to playgrounds with just mommy and her sister. She did say she was sorry, and said she’d listen.

But maybe it does make sense, because the first impression is by far the strongest; each and every subsequent interaction an individual has with your business then either supports and strengthens their first impression or undermines it. The more the first impression is reinforced, the stronger it becomes and the harder it becomes to undermine.

17 Dreaming From The Waist (5:26)
Thought I'd go out on a limb and post something that I'm supposing no one else will bother to listen to. That's fine - this one's for me but if you do feel so inclined I would beg your indulgence and ask you to give up a few minutes of this horribly rainy Bank Holiday to hear some of the greatest heavy rockin' in the known universe. Go on, I dare you. I know you won't regret it.
"You're just going to have to do your best," she said.
The other thing that struck me about the footage, is that there was little real condemnation of the terrorist attack by the Asians who were interviewed. Instead, they bleated that they felt they were being victimised as a result of it. The report states that there had been eight incidents reported that weekend, which were directly linked to the terrorist attack and that "most of these, in fact all of these have not been serious in nature" ie. probably verbal. To put this into perspective, the Strathclyde Police force serves a population of nearly 2.2 million people - hardly a vitriolic backlash. It is just typical that after a weekend in which a couple of Muslims attempt to kill many ordinary Glaswegians, the focus is on the suffering of the Muslim community, who were merely subjected to abuse that was not considered serious in nature.
These past few months have been ones of a bittersweet mingling of sorrow and joy. Sorrow at two heartbreaking personal losses, and joy in the delight of sharing my beloved grandchildren’s Christmas. I’ve been writing, but only in my hand-written journal; thoughts which perhaps are too dark, too close to the bone to share publicly. A thoughtful little note from another blogger has rekindled my desire to start blogging again, and I am thankful for his kindness.
So I guess tonight was a failure. Even though that’s the biggest deadlift I’ve ever seen a woman pull, and possibly the cleanest/easiest 20# PR I’ve ever seen, it’s not 400#. Yep, absolutely nothing to get excited about. Not until she can put her 215# Clean & Jerk and 325# Back Squat together with 5 more pounds for a 175# Snatch and 15# more for a 400# Deadlift—then you might see a little excitement from Elisabeth. Maybe she’ll execute a small fist pump or a whispered “fuck yeah,” or maybe she’ll just walk away and quietly revel in crushing numbers that some of us thought would never be reached.

March is also a month of birthdays. My mom's was on 5th, Beth's on the 11th, my mother-in-laws on the 12th, my dad's on the 15th, and Mike's was on 30th. It's an expensive month!

Since I generally have my film scanned to disc, I also have to hope they don't get any dust on the scan or film. Now, since I'm a cheapass when it comes to experimental projects, I just went for Costco- who usually does a great job and keeps the dust to a minimum while letting their negatives hang to dry. I still had issues with the scans produced from the film, but they really weren't any worse than some of the professional labs I've worked with in the past when I used film regularly.

This is at one of our favorite climbing places at school. It used to be an old rail road bridge. But the bridge became too unstable for a train to go across and so they moved it over and the old pillars still stand and are owned by the Lynchburg Climbing Club. It is just wonderful and so much fun to climb. On this one we definitely use rope.
I said to Kathy, “Just tell the students, ‘We know you really want this class and we are offering it even though we cannot guarantee that the program will run without crashing through the entire class. If it crashes, we will give you your money back or a free class at a future time when we can make it work.’”
That would have to be to just do it. I have this problem with my son all the time. He will sit there and stare at a blank piece of paper for hours trying to get the words to come to him. It's painful. I have to tell him all the time to just start writing and the words will start to work themselves out. Yes, he may have to go back and re-work some of the beginning because he wasn't “warmed up,” yet, but that's better than just sitting there. He always says how that will never work until he actually does it, so he always has to come back and tell me I was right.

From Michael A. Fletcher @ The Washington Post:
Here’s a truth I’ve learned after a lot of years in discipleship oriented ministries (and just from life in general.) Pain is often the front door Jesus uses to walk into someone’s life, sometimes for the first time and sometimes to drive greater relational depth with those who’ve known Him for years. That means we in the church should figure out how to stand at this doorway too.
If this is true, and the news does not reach the media, then the BNP are going to make this news public all over the internet anyway.
She smiled at the silliness of her thoughts—why would Seth be intrigued by someone as unmysterious as she?—and turned her attention back to the photos. The slide show had started over. There were the images of the abandoned sofa, the dogs racing beside the SUV, the joggers’ shoe prints, the expanse of the desert. Wait! What was that flare? She paused the slide show, clicked on the arrow to bring back a panoramic view of the desert she’d shot from the top of the knoll, and zoomed in to get a closer look at the flaw in the image. Oh, just the morning sun glinting off a distant car. If she decided to use the photo, she could use the smudge feature of Alexander’s photo editing program to remove the vehicle. Or not—the car did offer a human perspective to the alien landscape.
“I think it’s important to point out that Helen wasn’t doing this for any kind of self-aggrandizement. Far from trying to exploit her relationship with a famous person from the past, to sell books or whatever, she kept the experiences under wraps. I don’t know if she ever mentioned them to anyone besides her husband and me, and she told me precious little. That is, she had no motivation to fake this, at least not in terms of public attention or potential wealth. A pseudoskeptic might insist that she got an internal boost to her self-esteem simply by fantasizing a connection with someone significant, but I think that in that case she would have talked a great deal about it and made sure everyone was aware of her new importance.”

At no time did the defence challenge the authenticity or authorship of the documentation submitted.

One might hope that accepting full responsibility might mean Coleman is acknowledging that his behaviour has been unacceptable, and that he needs to change. It is more likely, however, that he is simply hoping that he can bide his time on the backbenches, and somehow engineer his way back to power. If that he what he thinks, he has made yet another serious miscalculation.

My first little project was a snowman. First of all I must mention the fabulous Ann Pickard who is often on Create and Craft. All of these designs are hers and I have tried to follow her instructions in order to make these little Christmas cuties....practice makes perfect I guess! So I used her techniques of making cones for body and arms and then a double cone so that his nose didn't fall out and just a disc for his scarf to keep it simple. I would ideally like to have done a different colour but was messing around with orange, black and white so just kept with that for the majority if what I made. What do you think? Honest opinions please....any tips anyone can give me would be gratefully received!

Light. Pure, golden light penetrated through my eyelids. At first, there was wonder. Where had the light come from? Then shrieks and screams came from the dark ones around me. They were screaming a name! I couldn’t understand why they were so afraid. I could almost feel the delicious light as it poured over and around me. It brought a warmth to inner soul as nothing else ever had. With my eyes still closed, I listened as the shrieks and screams died away. I could sense that I was alone…except for the light. Slowly, ever so slowly, I opened my eyes for the second time that night and felt my breath catch in my throat. He was standing there. I recognized Him even though I had never seen Him before. Jesus…

We'll be there for a day, then travel around South Africa, to the Waterberg Area, wine country, and end the trip with a few days in Capetown.

Mulcahy immediately sensed Wilson’s essential toughness, but there was nothing unusual about such men inside the C.I.A. and it was a characteristic that could be admired. Mid-1976 was a period of travail for the C.I.A., which was under attack in the press for its illegal domestic spying activities and under investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee for its foreign assassination efforts. Mulcahy learned, shortly after joining Wilson and Terpil, that President Ford had placed severe new restrictions on clandestine C.I.A. activities. Wilson and Terpil suddenly became more legitimate in his eyes: ”I thought it was logical that the agency would set it up this way and have their people on the street freelancing.”
Nonetheless, I was a little heartbroken...It just seems as though he should not only play baseball, but he should also love it as well. I appreciate his love of soccer and I can see that he really enjoys himself and is very good at it. I told him that we would wait to see how he felt this coming Spring, but if he didn't want to play baseball, that would be fine. I would just want him to replace it with other outdoor activities. I am a firm believer in trying to listen to your children and taking stock in what they have to say, even if it isn't exactly what you want to hear.
In this relentless attack on women as human beings, leftists crank up a phony “war on women” based solely on who pays for abortion and birth control (both are legal and readily available to women in this country, they just want tax payers to fund it, regardless of our own personal and/or religious beliefs). But as the recent video from Smart Girl Politics notes, women care about the economy, the Constitution, and a myriad of other issues (aside: one of the things that turned me off ’80′s feminism was an article about “women’s issues” that focused–and you can’t make this stuff up–on things that “issue” from a woman’s body. Reading that I became convinced that “feminism” was dedicated not to equality but to oppression, not to seeing women as people but to seeing them as “other”–the very thing that all the “isms” claim to reject but actually embrace–and exploit–with wholehearted and gleeful gusto.):

Ravenscrag was inherited by Allan’s eldest son Sir Montagu Allan who in 1942 donated the home to the Royal Victoria Hospital after the death of their last remaining child. The lavish interior was completely gutted by the new owners, only the Victorian ground floor library supposedly remains somewhat intact to how it was originally. Despite the great work that is carried out at the Institute, I can’t help but imagine what a great museum, hotel or tourist attraction this building could have been.
When I originally blogged the Many Masks of MSG I had not come into contact with Dr. Russell L. Blaylock, MD. He is a board certified neurosurgeon, who has written books on the topic of Excitotoxins. As I read through one of them, Excitotoxins-the taste that kills, it just overwhelmed me about the information presented I hadn’t seen in the over 30 years in the medical field. Even in nursing school, we never discussed anything like this. How can we be involved in “holistic” medicine when all we knew was give the body the four food groups and we could be healthy? Well little did I learn that the US Senate Bill 264 1936(read it) …… was published to tell us that the nutritional value of foods had decreased over the years---but it wasn’t publicized? Remember how wonder bread “builds stronger bodies 12 ways”? Over the time the label changed to “builds stronger bodies 9 ways” Then after that there was no mention of that on the label at all! Consider the fact that wonder bread (which I consumed as a child) was probably un-building my body 12 ways if not more. Take the process for making flour white. The last two steps are bleaching the grain----that’s got to be good for the body, right? I have heard from more than 2 doctors the following statement:

To fill out your impressions, I should add that it had only three forward gears, finger indicators, a single windscreen wiper that grew slower and slower as the engine laboured, for instance when driving uphill in the rain.

When I boarded the plane, I had two seats in the bassinet row, but they were not together. I did not want to ask anyone to move, so I had no idea what to do. I always hate when people board and ask me to give up my seat due to a lack of planning on their part. Well, karma did not bite me in the butt that day. The stewardess asked someone if that person would move, and I found two seats together. ;-) Yeah...then again wouldn't you give up your seat instead of sitting next to an almost five year old on the flight just to have a window seat? I expected there to be other adoptive families, but honestly, I didn't see other kids. The plane had not even loaded, and someone staring at me asked why Americans go to other countries to adopt instead of adopting their own. I saw a few smiles from people in the other rows, and thought.. ugh... it is starting already....

I am not a huge fan of the whole Thanksgiving meal, it's something I could easily (and have in the past) missed. I don't like turkey and I can make my own mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes anytime I want and well I want them like I want them, so it's easier to make them on my own. So Thanksgiving is my sister's holiday to host. This works out well for me so I don't have to fuss over a meal I don't care to eat. I also decided this year that Thanksgiving to me is allot like Valentine's Day for some people. Why am I being told to be thankful this one day shouldn't I always be thankful? I am a glass half full type of person, and I believe God takes care of His own. He won't let me down, and if He does it's something I just don't see at this time. So Thanksgiving is a non-holiday holiday for me. All this said (sorry I ramble) I was told this year to make an appetizer. Great! My Homemade Gourmet dips are on sale this month (you have 4 more days) and I ordered a bunch with my first order to have on hand. I asked my husband which he would like and he picked the Gusto Garlic Pesto Cheese Ball. It was super simple I left 2 cream cheeses (one 1/3 fat and one full fat) out to soften and then dumped them and the mix in the mixer beat for 1-2 minutes and dumped in a container. I was done! I got some wheat thins to go with it and cut up some broccoli (for my sister the health nut). It did not pair well with the broccoli after it set it was too hard to eat with the broccoli, and really I had that to appease my sister. The dip was what it's name says it's GUSTO! I could easily have made it into a cheese ball, but since I had to travel with it both to and from the dinner I chose to just leave it in the bowl. It had set nicely in the fridge overnight and would not have been too difficult to make a ball out of. So that was my Thanksgiving contribution.

The issue before the CAFC in Bilski was broadly stated to cover "what the term 'process' in §101 means, and how to determine whether a given claim . . . is a 'new and useful process.'" However, it became apparent early in the opinion that this broad question was going to be chiseled into narrower subsets. The court immediately began to formulate and set aside narrowing rules that seemed to spiral out of control halfway through the majority opinion, and ended up in a Jacobellis-like impression that a patentable process was like pornography: we can't define it, but we know it when we see it.

As a worked at learning to draw and animate, I thought more and more about what I was trying to accomplish as an animator. I realized that I wanted to animate fun characters, but gradually I also realized that I wanted to tell stories that made people feel real emotions. I wanted to make films as funny as Chuck Jones' Warner Brothers shorts, and I also wanted to make films that could make you worry over the fate of the characters, like "Pinocchio", or "Lady and the Tramp", and make you get choked up or maybe even cry over what happened to the characters, like "Bambi" or "Dumbo". Those things seemed like great magic tricks, and I was always searching for answers about how that was possible using only drawings.

If you are a young adult receiving financial support then sit down and talk with your parents about their expectations of you. Communication is key and all parties have to do their part. Why wait until the door locks are changed and your stuff is thrown out on the front porch?
How sad!
These two German lads have been sitting in Messrs Maguire all year. I guess with competition from the house beers and macros they never really sold, since they were being flogged at a knock-down rate when I picked them up to take away. Both are from Ankerbräu in Nördlingen. An odd choice of name for a brewery in thoroughly landlocked Bavaria.
The second question - "Whose is bigger?" - is even more ridiculous and superfluous, of course. It's the best equipped army in the world against a ragtag army of rocket launchers. Nonetheless, this has to be proven to everyone, both to them and us, over and over.

Have you ever had your picture taken and accidentally looked at the flashbulb as the flash went off? Then you are familiar with that “burned out” spot in your eyes. It usually clears up in a fairly short period of time. Now imagine having that burned out spot grow larger and larger until it covers your entire visual field. Then imagine that spot staying with you for months.

All in all, it was just a great evening. I'd like to thank Julie, Chloe and the rest of the Tor team for my invite! It was also fab meeting up with various industry/blogging types.

In 1978, Ed Koch replaced Abe Beame as Mayor. Although Koch had begun his political career as a liberal reformer and a bitter opponent of Carmine DeSapio, he had generally friendly relations with Jim McManus, and in fact in the one election in which McManus was challenged in 1984, Koch appeared at his victory party. Koch’s approach to his position as Mayor was to support development and economic growth in the City generally by privatizing City development efforts through leases of land to private developers who would construct projects. He thus sought to act as a cheerleader for economic activity, which revived in the 1980’s. One of his major projects was Times Square redevelopment, which involved the condemnation and purchase of land in the block between seventh and eighth avenues, the historical heart of 42nd Street and the theater district. It was proposed that the entire block would be condemned and acquired by the City and then or sold/ leased to private developers who would construct large office buildings with heavy City subsidies. In this way this central but deteriorated block now home to the same kind of urban blight of prostitutes, pimps and a number of pornographic bookstores as in Hell’s Kitchen in the 70’s would be replaced by a modern state of the art commercial district. The plan was bitterly opposed by the Durst and Brandt families who were the major landowners on the block as a waste of taxpayer money and totally out of character with the historical role of the area as the City’s entertainment center. However, the plan was approved by the City’s Board of Estimate and most of the land was condemned. By the time all the lawsuits challenging the project were settled, the success of the efforts to defeat the urban blight in Hell’s Kitchen was becoming clear, and many began to ask more loudly why such a huge government subsidized project was necessary, if on the next block across eighth avenue in Hell’s Kitchen, with Manhattan Plaza and theater row there could be such substantial development of clean entertainment uses without large government subsidies. It was rarely, if ever mentioned that, unlike the massive redevelopment plan for Times Square which was designed in an office downtown, the moving force for the redevelopment of the area West of Eighth had been the community and its political leadership—principally Jimmy McManus and the McManus Democratic Association. However, partially as a result of these considerations and the stock market crash of 1987, there were significant revisions to the Times Square redevelopment plan to include more entertainment uses, and ultimately to include the Durst family as a developer of several of the office buildings.

Of course there is no universal rule that applies to all on screen adaptions but for the most part I find the cinema trip a rather daunting experience. It is with trepidation that I go to visit these characters, to whom I have devoted endless hours; feeling their anguish, and saying their words with a fervent but silent voice in my head . I tend to leave my expectations at home when I go to the cinema as I assume disappointment is inevitable.

For the same reason that many agencies will set up social accounts, will create guidelines that ensure the brand identity and tone of voice is carried across these channels and develop and deliver content strategies, but hand the day to day control and updates back to the client. Those doing the job day in day out know their job. They know the issues. They know their audiences. They know their products and services. It’s a fast moving platform and responses need to be well informed and speedy to avoid a debate spiraling out of control while people wait for sign off.
But the move should be over by Wednesday. Good news, right? Eh, not really, I’ll probably be heading out of state to help my sister with her kids while she’s in the hospital recovering from giving birth to her fourth. I’ll be out there a month at the most, as she has had a very difficult pregnancy. And I love her kids. I’ll probably hate them by the time I get back home, but right now I love them.
This horrific operation still exists today and all this suffering is for something so superficial; fashion. China supplies the U.S. and Europe with half of their fur products.

Why the announcement by Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee that TSA agents, as well as armed police will now be riding on the buses of the Houston city bus system. No they are not taking in the sights of the third largest city in America, but will be performing random bag and purse searches, as well as pat downs.

Still, at this point adding another year seems to be more appropriate for statistical analysis or body maintenance than anything.

Rather, it's just another mile marker along the highway of life.

I was trying to decide what different fabrics I was going to use to make the dress because she had made it so cute with like 4 different coordinating fabrics so I hit up my sewing board on pinterest to get some inspiration and was over the moon with excitement when I came across a dress I had pinned, I knew without a doubt then what I was going to do.
So hopefully we will be purchasing these lovelies in the near future and then installing them ourselves! Yikes…Dan is really handy and many of his family members have installed laminate floors before so I’m pretty confident that it won’t be a problem. And we’ll save a ton of money. I’m so excited and I know it will really open up our room to get rid of the cheapo carpet. And then I can get a nice big rug so it’s still comfy! I will definitely update on our progress.
Fiona Looney’s script is very clever and endearing and I feel this play will run for many years in many different venues and will be well quoted along the way. I’m sorry now I missed Dandelions. The scene where the father is behind the newspaper, the son behind the laptop and the mother on the edge of the seat wondering what it’s all about works brilliantly. Three separate conversations ensue, but despite the interruption of technology and everyone doing their own thing, the closeness and love within the family still shone through. It’s a fabulous human story about our inability to straddle a number of lives and contentment or lack of with the choices we do make.
I’ve been thinking a lot about literacy as it is the goal of our school to improve on this area of learning over the next number of years. As a team, teachers and administrators as well as the Western School Board, we hope to take a balanced, holistic approach to improving literacy in our school. Being a parent myself, I thought I would share some personal thoughts on the subject with you all. Feel free to comment as you wish! Thanks for reading, and I look forward to seeing you all at Parent-Teacher Interviews. As always, please feel free to contact me at the school at any time.
How do your daily interactions nourish you? Are there disagreements or areas of conflict that could be resolved? Are there rituals of respect built into your life?

Easter. I have honestly been asking if it is Easter yet for the last three weeks, as I have no idea when it actually is and some kids down the street were definitely hunting for eggs in their front yard so they confused me. I guess it shows how big a deal Easter is for me...Time to ask Kyle a bunch of questions about Jesus and not really get it.

I don't like having to hold back. Don't like boundaries much. But all writers need to work within boundaries, and every genre, every age group, has them. You'd think historical fiction would have tighter boundaries than most. After all, we're constrained by the political or social mores of the times we write about, and have to work within the lack of inventions or technology that the facts give us. I remember the time I really really needed my characters to have a mobile phone and I had to create a convoluted method for them to know each other's whereabouts. Pah!

The idea of being powerful is basically Chronicle’s main thread. The movie’s three important characters are all fairly different. Andrew is a recluse and a loner with a pretty awful home-life. He is abused by his father and his mother is dying of cancer. Right away we can see that something probably isn’t going to end well with him. He’s bullied at school, is generally unliked by everyone he knows, and only has one friend in his cousin Matt. Matt himself is fairly popular, if kind of a stoner, but has a moral core that not even a bunch of nihilistic literature can break. The third character is Steve, a jock and prom king type character that is nevertheless charming and incredibly likable. The three of them stumble on a hole in the ground during a party that Andrew has unwillingly gone to, and they find something bizarre inside that gives them all superpowers.

When I read Isaiah on the car ride to the Mayo Clinic, I was reminded to not put my faith in men or things of the world. All things are created by the one and only Creator! When I was thinking about the procedure that my Father was about to have and how we were talking about how “lucky” he was to be able to get this done at the Mayo with the best Dr.’s anyone could ask for I remembered what I read in Isaiah; It’s not about the Dr.’s or the Mayo Clinic. My Father’s life lies in the hands of the Lord and he is using these Dr.’s to give my Father the best care. You can’t turn down great opportunities like going to the Mayo Clinic or any grand gesture that the Lord is giving you and using for his glory, but you must acknowledge your creator for all your good fortune.
There have been at least two radical-left publications named "Vorwaerts" (the German word for "Forward"). One was the daily newspaper of the Social Democratic Party of Germany whose writers included Friedrich Engels and Leon Trotsky. It still publishes as the organ of Germany's SDP, though that party has changed considerably since World War II. Another was the 1844 biweekly reader of the Communist League. Karl Marx, Engels and Mikhail Bakunin are among the names associated with that publication.

Like I was making eye-contact with at least a three-digit-number of people everyday, some smiled back, some didn’t, some waved me on, while some gave me blank stares. (Worst, of course, were the small number always in groups who would shout or whistle or call out just to attract my attention and then snigger about it, quite irritating.)

The previous post discussed an ethical dilemma presented by Peter Singer concerning the choice between saving some fancy shoes or a drowning child in a shallow pond. The conclusion was that charity is the best we can do within the given social structures, but that justice requires counter-cultural living. The way of following Jesus is not charity, but justice. It requires a radical reorientation of our lives away from token charity to a new kind of Jubilee economics.
I learned about body language and dialogues and monologues and timing. I learned the importance of comedy and tragedy, how each have their place, how each are essential to the overall plot. I learned how to pay close attention to what was happening around me, the entrances and exists, the spoken words of others, the unspoken emotions of each scene. I learned how to react appropriately. I learned how to fit into it all.

I mean what kind of homework gets much better than watching TV and reflecting on it and receiving others thoughts on the show. I must admit it is pretty cool.

This prevents a proprietor who has narrowed his claims during prosecution in order to meet requirements of patentability from then asserting the patent against any equivalent technologies falling within the scope of a surrendered territory.

Iris, our 20-something year old receptionist, is plagued with a lack of inquisitiveness. She seems happy to show up to work, do what she's always done, and collect her paycheck even when things are changing around her. As the offices go empty and her nameless colleagues seem to fall off the face of the earth, she doesn't bat an eye. When her boss demands that she immediately run strange errands and then, upon her return, has disappeared for days without word, she shrugs her shoulders and etches cryptic messages in black sharpie on walls, furniture, and anything else she happens across. Left to her own devices, she begins arriving at work earlier and earlier and starts spying on the hermit-like man who appears to be living in the adjoining suite. Iris wears her awkward, clumsy personality around herself like a coat, burrowing in deep, comfortable in her uncomfortable nature. She has this unnerving, uncanny way of making the strange seem simply mundane. And that's the trick to the story. That's what makes Radio Iris work.

As I was reliving that moment of feeling so stuck, so lonely, so not enough suddenly I saw the ceiling of that kitchen literally rolled back like clouds and all this light flooded that room. I felt myself literally lifted out of that place of “just not being enough” straight into God’s embrace. I was free of the darkness of that “secret place” that had driven me for so many years as I was consumed with God’s love.
“Then don’t, Bryan. I enjoy a little harmless playing, especially if it leads into somethin’ else.” Mara mouthed into his ear and exaggerated the end of the sentence for affect.

How does one review a true masterpiece? Clearly when reading and reviewing a series of books that calls itself ‘Masterworks’, this is in an important question. Ask someone who knows what they are talking about to name the 10 best classic science fiction works. The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin is a good candidate for that list. Ask someone to name the 10 best classic science fiction works by a woman author and The Left Hand of Darkness is probably number one.

Despite his warnings to others, La Trobe made notes on the recipes of these concoctions for his own personal use. One wonders if the aftereffects of too much ‘Julep’ were not causative of the ill description of the trip to Milledgeville in his book, “The Rambler in North America:
At the moment I'm in the middle of decorating Sophie's nursery and am about to order the cutest set of wall decals ever which I can't wait to share with you all. The only trouble is, I'm having a real dilema trying to choose the colours. Today, I've been stuck on the Pantone website while the girls are napping, trying to decide on colour swatches... mulling over what the difference is for example between 338c, 3375C and 3385C... it's been seriously doing my head in! Is one sample too blue or grey? Is another lighter or darker? What would go better with the pastel tones in Sophie's nursery?
And then, somewhere else, is a second version of myself. A thirty-something mother living in poverty in a third-world country, someone who has lost children to preventable disease carried in dirty drinking water, whose children don’t go to school, not because she has fancy notions of homeschooling, but because she can’t afford the shoes they need to walk there. Yet this mother sings while washing clothes, points out a flower struggling through a crack in the pavement, tells her children magical stories full of beauty.
Those who say what point change? generally quote the cost of accountability. But what is the cost without it? It’s not so much about creating charismatic leaders with unwieldy powers. We just need leaders. A Robin Wales or Jules Pipe are not the most well known citizens in Newham or Hackney by the man down the pub. But they know how to bring interest groups together and champion their area. Who governs? They do.

Anyways, pretending you already have that rosey floral or bat winged ensemble of your choice I highly suggest a valance or 'bed skirt'. In this lolita rundown of your bed fabrics consider it the petticoat, as in lots of frills, no so much as in 'it holds everything up'. Unessecary frills to hide unsightly bed springs? Oh that's gotta be in a lolita room ;D Decorative pillows is probably my best suggestion. You can buy these for $10-$50 and they come in all shapes, sizes colours etc. Best thing yet they are pure decoration. Go cheap and get the scratchy ones, you're not actually sleeping with them, it's just to make it look pretty. Decorative pillows on a bed can look truly cute and...well like a centre piece for your bedspread, buy a few and mix and match every now and again. Better yet pillows are an inexpensive, and without a doubt the easiest, sewing project you may ever embark on. Get creative! Apply an AP felt logo, string some pearls around the edges or tea dye it to match a classic champagne rose colour.
This is weird.
Our dinner was marinated grilled chicken, grilled by me, oven french fries, which I had like five of, yum, a huge salad with cucumbers and romaine and spinach and tomatoes and green peppers. And watermelon. And, only five children at the table! All the rest of them are at the youth conference. Paul and I, and five kids. It was rather easy to set the table, and wash the dishes. I still grilled lots of chicken, because we will eat it tomorrow.
For the most part these were written contemporary accounts of major incidents and alliances of the great nations which made up ancient Britain: from Cornwall in the south, through ancient Wales, Man, Anglesey, Dunbritton (Dumbarton), Strathclyde, Anglia (Northumberland) and Prydein (Pictland). Many copies were made and originals are now lost. It is accepted within historial circles that each ‘nation’ had its own chronicle and an original Pictish Chronicle existed as a separate series of documents held at Pictish church centres like Deer, St Andrews and in the Pictish capital, Forteviot. None survives.

I will say at first I was scared on if the product would cause streaking, orange skin or simply not last. Well, after using this product I have not been faced with any of these issues. I really think the mitt helps with having no streaking it really allows for a even application for the product. There was also a nice little paper with a detail of how many pumps you should use for each body part. For example, for the face use a 1/4 of a pump.

We have been talking a lot about snacks lately. Snacks, mindless eating, sneak eating and that ravenous I just got home from work get out of my way eating. I am not forgetting my SAHM sisters. I know how busy we are too. Isn't just easier to grab something quick to stave off hunger? The problem with those quick things is they are the least satisfying. If I grab a couple of cookies or a small brownie, I am usually hungry in about 10 minutes. The leader gave a very eye opening example. A single two inch brownie is about the value of 5 points. About 300 calories. Five apples hold about the same amount of calories with the difference of quality. Do I want that brownie? Heck yeah!? Am I going to eat 5 apples in one setting? Ummm....no.

Well here is the twist. A blow that equals or beats the 'to wound' score does not just tally up a hit like other systems. No. A wound blow will instantly kill a model unless you decided to take a Dreadskull from your pile and use it as a wound marker on that model instead. Depending on your strategy, that means a wounding blow may just kill a big thing outright without having to hack away at it for hours!
I decided to take the plunge with a friend, and did a few quick match games of 2v2. We played four games, and we won one of them.

The thing is, when a product review blogger is sent a product to review, it is expected that the item will be used fairly immediately and written about as soon as possible. But when a product like this requires constant use for two weeks up to two months to see any noticeable effects, that's kind of hard to do.
There is no way out of the room unless you write on the paper. You will notice that the “random” device sends most papers to the room on the left. Through the frosted glass you can see it is has the most markers. What else they don’t tell you is that it is staffed by people who know as much about the road rules as you do. This is actually a good thing: if you sound like you know what you’re talking about, they will be too scared to call your bluff. Otherwise whether they tick pass or fail depends on the time of the day, what they had for lunch, how bad their night was, or how bored they are. Behind the other doors lurk those markers who think they know the road rules, and those who think the ones who think they know the road rules have got it wrong. They will both fail you.
I was a pretty hairless kid until I turned one, and even then, my hair wasn’t somewhat long until I was five. I have a lot of hair, it’s just not super thick. And I have a tendency (which drives some people crazy, apparently) to like to cut my hair (No, I wasn’t the kid that would cut her own hair). I’m not the kind of person that goes every six weeks, but I’m the kind of person that when I go, I go all out and get something different done. When I was six, I had shoulder-length hair that I (read: my mom) got chopped off. Like, all the way off. I had an ear-length bob by first grade class pictures.

Just look at the impact of Afghan jihad on the Muslim world. The jihad of Kashmir started in 1988. Mujahideen who were trained in Afghan jihad, came back and fought in Kashmir. Also the Palestinian Intifada started in 1988. All those Mujahideen stood up against Israel who got trained in Afghanistan. Again, in 1988, those Chechen Mujahideen also revolted who had participated in Afghan jihad. The jihad in Checheniya, which is the longest jihad in the world, got a new life . The Chechens have been doing jihad since 1780, starting from Imam Mansoor, then Sheikh Abdullah Daghistani, followed by Imam Shamil and still going on. Even after almost 200 years, they have not surrendered. Afghan jihad gave them new blood and the movement for freedom became active again. All Islamic resistance movements in the world activated, from Indonesia, Philippines to Algeria, North Africa, especially in the areas where the enemy had occupied, like Israel, India and Checheniya.

I remember the day you broke Trevor Hoffman's record, I came home early from work to watch the end of the game on TV. It was an afternoon game, and if Jack were alive he would have been home from school watching with me. Watching you record the final three outs was bittersweet. I watched with tears in my eyes as you struck out the last batter—happy for your accomplishment but filled with sadness that Jack was not there to share the moment with me.

I've also had to drive my kids around to their various activities. All the events at my children's elementary school seem to have been scheduled for the next 2 months. Plus, my daughter is "graduating" from 6th grade so she has twice as many functions. I don't get the graduation part though. When I went into middle school, all I did was change schools; there was no graduation ceremony, no going out to dinner, and definitely no presents. Sometimes I think we over-celebrate our kids' accomplishments. What's going to happen to them when they get a job and they don't get a gift for completing an entire week of work?!
Something changed as the months passed. As E correctly predicted, I begun to get attached to Gino. It was not that I meant to - I don't want to give that impression. It was just that he was so kind and available.

The band has toured heavily behind their albums and gained the reputation as being an explosive live act. In 2010, The Pack A.D. released the album We Kill Computers, an album which took two years to make, but one that was recorded live to analog tape in under two weeks, it was also the longest gap between releases for the band. But this does not deter or take away from the album, one that was essentially born on the road and one that focused more on the bands Garage and Punk influences and it reflects that. The album featured songs such as “Deer’, “B.C. Is On Fire”, and “Catch” all add to the overall heavier Rock dynamics of We Kill Computers.

Mei Ling heads down the passage and right after the groom closes the hidden door, he is discovered by guards. He attempts to kill himself, but he is knocked out and drug away.

The IFE has been exposed as an avowedly anti-democratic organisation that supports the establishment by force of a global Muslim "Ummah". Effectively this would be a fascist empire that would murder all those who did not follow its direction. Non-Muslims and dissident Muslims alike would be killed. People who support such a notion should be labelled fascists because there is no difference between this concept and the Third Reich (except perhaps for the fact that even Hitler did not seek to forcibly change everyone's religion nor conquer the whole globe).

The hubbub subsides, but the 2wo girls next to me who rushed over to ambulance chase are still there as I take the last wedge and eat it's tepid goodness. The 1ne on the left is impossibly pretty and the 1ne on the right isn't, but makes up for it at random intervals by slapping the pretty girl on the back in a supportive way, but also with enough force to get rid of any anger she feels about having to spend time with this person and her inane stories. And also to suggest that whatever genetic gifts she missed out on in the looks department are balanced out by a genetic ability to mask low key hostility in a faux friendly manner. They both have the same T-shirt style on as well, black and sparkly, so I get caught up in whether their friendship is a continual game of 1ne-upmanship only 1ne person can ever win. The pretty girl though is depressed, since her boyfriend has just dumped her. She folds her arms and screws up her face when she begins her story as if she's dis-interested in her own words, but soon she's emoting as if she's just typed a combination of a semi colon and shift/0 on her computer. It's a completely over blown performance, worthy of an out-take from The Brown Bunny. As she raps up, she declares the problem with her ex boyfriend is that she loves him but she's not in love with him. Her friend is used to these McGrawesque nuggets of pondering, and barely stirs from her thickshake stirring, but I to this minute have no idea what that means, and the old man, a peripheral figure in my day until now, decides this is the moment to stare at the girls like Henry from Portrait Of A Serial Killer, and simply say to them loudly a 2wo word cursing phrase popular in Tarantino films. He then leaves, disgusted, and storms off into a chemist where he transacts as quickly as possible with the guy behind the counter, while the girls stand open mouthed, frozen in mutual horror at being dissed, and a small jockey like man 2wo tables over laughs so hard at Grandad swearing, he knocks over a coke and gives that poor unseen cleaner so much more to do later on in the day...
Audi R18 e-tron quattro is the name of the new Le Mans prototype that makes its race debut on May 5 in the 6-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps (Belgium) and fights for overall victory at the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans (France) on June 16/17. Audi unites two technologies in a fascinating way to create a new type of drive, which is also already being tested for future use in production cars: e-tron quattro.
Some people are arguing for a move up to Heavyweight. I think that’d be a mistake on his part, and he should instead arrange the dream fight everyone wants to see: Anderson Silva vs. Jon Jones instead. A superstar fight in catch-weight where they meet half way. Their match-up is perfect and it is a fight I am sure that every single MMA fighter wants to see.

Miki’s voice provider worked for Ki/oon records who are owned by Sony putting Miki into the same category as Piko. Miki also holds a somewhat cyborg look to her and like Piko is mainly cosplayed by women. She is an intermediate leveled cosplay. She has very long hair and like Piko a ahoge, though unlike Piko she has what appears to be fur as well as some shapes and patterns on her and her clothing. If you’re a beginner cosplayer don’t let miki’s costume intimidate you. Remember that cosplay is just for fun it doesn’t matter if your’s isn’t the best.

One of Ruby’s friends Leroy (Ving Rhames) talks to Fool about how much crap his family are in, including telling him that they are going to be evicted for not paying their rent on time and that his mother’s cancer is treatable but because they don’t have any money she is dying.

One could say I have given up. But that wouldn't be entirely true. There is some light shining through. Starting around late February/early March, a really intense apathy grew inside me regarding school, life, and music. I didn't practice the piano as much, I didn't listen to as much music, I didn't talk to anyone about anything. I pretty much stopped caring, and no it is not all better now. BUT, it is getting better. Here is how.
I am now 7+ years into this autism journey and I've come a long way in that time. That by no means makes me a veteran, but I'm through the beginning stages. I've done my grieving; yes, I grieved. I grieved, and I raged (oh yes. I raged), and I was filled with pure terror for weeks and months at a time. I had days of extreme "self pitying" lows, extreme "worrying about my kid" lows, extreme panic about the future, and all those goddamn what ifs and what ifs and what ifs again. Why did this happen? What did I do wrong? Is this my fault??? I ate tuna when I was pregnant. He got all of his shots. What should I have done differently? Why did this happen to him? To me?

Going around town to the openings last week, I contemplated the idea of not having art at the opening for a show at all, and just putting it up on Saturday for regular gallery hours. Not even as a smarmy conceptual “gesture” just as being blatantly pragmatic. You don’t want the work damaged, people have trouble seeing it, it’s all a big mess. But I think most people wouldn’t stand for it. Maybe graduate students who are just learning about the idea of nothing being more brilliant than something, but that is about it. And besides, you want money, and you have to have something to sell. Even if it is an arrangement of broken 2x4s and cinderblocks.
1. Character is more than talk. Anyone can say that he has integrity, but action is the real indicator of character. Your character determines who you are and what you do. Do you say you trust God? Does your actions prove what you say to be true? That’s why you can never seperate a leader’s character from their actions. If yoru actions and intentions continually work against each other, look to your character to find out why.

I had multiple moments throughout the show where I just felt my heart swell. They did a great job with audience interaction—handing out these cool light-up wristbands that blinked different colors throughout the concert, shooting confetti everywhere, launching beach balls from who knows where. Everything was choreographed like we were all at one big party together. And then there was the music. Gorgeous. Wonderful. Echoing off the Hollywood Hills. I love being around other fans and feeling like you're all there together, just completely in love with the performers on stage.
Ok I’ve had a week or so now to wallow in my own sort of bad place. I have come to some conclusions. I think I need a support group to get on track. I am going to investigate Weight Watchers and a Nutritionist some one recommended to me. I think I cannot go back and forth on this life change. It’s hard to do it alone and now it’s time to ask for help. I think having the support of you all out there in the blog worlds is also helpful. I don’t feel so alone in my struggle.
That’s because we learn how to write in school; and in school, writing is always done under what I call “performance” conditions: it counts—it will be read, assessed, graded. Even in most creative writing workshops and writers’ groups, the focus is on performance writing—not, in this case, to get a grade, but to write something good enough to get published. The problem with this approach is that it’s impossible to learn your skills and to improve them if you never give yourself a chance to practice. Most aspiring writers are doing themselves a great disservice by focusing on trying to write publishable pieces. They simply don’t have the skills they need to produce professional-quality work. Instead of trying to get published, they need to devote themselves, at least for a while, to practice.

After realizing that one travel agent's best ticket price was $1540, I decided to call another agent. After a few hours and three different flights, he found us tickets for $1511 almost $30 cheaper. Times three that saves us almost $100! Woo-hoo!
When a friend bailed him out, he was planning to move to South Dakota to avoid the charges and escape the pressures in his home. But that day, he went to visit the graveside of his friend and mentor, Randy, whom he had discovered dead in his armchair a few weeks before. As he mourned, he found himself crying out to Randy: “Are you in heaven; are you out there? Is there another life? Answer me if there is!” And as he stayed, tears streaming down his face, he felt himself pushed down to his knees, as he was crying out to God to show up. As he drove away from the grave, he saw Shane pass him in his truck, going home. Shane’s and Rickey’s daughters had become best friends, and Rickey felt like Shane had what he wished for: a good family, stability, happiness at home, faith in God. He pulled in behind him, and followed Shane to his home, then told him he wanted what he had. Shane was reluctant to take any credit for what he had; he knew that a lot of what he had was still being contested daily. What impressed Rickey was that Shane did not tell him that his life was tied up with a bow. He talked about struggles, failures, successes, and being committed to the long haul, with God, his wife, kids, job, and neighbors. Rickey was ready; he committed himself that day to follow Jesus, repent of the way he had been living, and take a whole new course.

A few days later, the argument is over. You've both had your say, and there is nothing more to do.
You haven’t lived until you’ve gone grocery shopping with six kids in tow. I would rather swim, covered in bait, through the English Channel, be a contestant on Fear Factor when they’re having pig brains for lunch, or do fourth grade math than to take my six kids to the grocery store. Because I absolutely detest grocery shopping, I tend to put it off as long as possible. There comes a time, however, when you’re peering into your fridge and thinking, ‘Hmmm, what can I make with ketchup, Italian dressing, and half an onion,’ that you decide you cannot avoid going to the grocery store any longer. Before beginning this most treacherous mission, I gather all the kids together and give them “The Lecture“.
And then I saw Jaws and all of a sudden being further into the ocean than where I could stand was unacceptable. Totally ridiculous of course.
My wife thought it was a bit mad that I was pushing my novel, WEE ROCKETS, only available as an ebook, when I didn't own an ereader. And to be honest, I felt a bit bad about that too. I'd bought a few ebooks for the Kindle app on my iPod Touch but they were a pain in the arse to read that way. And while I tried out the Kindle for PC app, I found that wasn't for me either. But this thing... wow. I'm currently blazing through Anthony Neil Smith's All The Young Warriors (bloody brilliant it is too) and have lined up a host of exciting ebooks when I'm done with it. Yesterday I was able to eat a big sloppy sandwich and read at the same time as the Kindle sat on my desk without me having to battle a paperback spine with my thumb. And I love the font size I picked for my poor, punished eyes.
Then there’s the extremely sporadically Miniwargaming’s WM/H battreps. They are great in the way they are made, fun to watch, but as a hardcore Warmahordes player I want more than just a “friendly” game. Don’t get me wrong, I mean hardcore as someone who loves the game, who basically stopped playing anything else because WM is THAT great, and who thinks, reads, and talks (or types) about the game a good bunch of time a week. Means I want more than just a recap. I want the players’ imput on lists, and advanced tactics whenever possible.

First there was to much stress related to the holidays: baking, christmas related stuff, etc, then came our holiday at the in-laws in Germany for one week. I spent the end of the last year and start of the new year in bed with a mean cold.
Thank you everyone for following me and for bearing with me during the occasional crazies! And thank you Miss Brook Anna!
This got me to thinking...what is my answer to that question? Even if you don't have kids, you could easily replace "child" with "Mom", "spouse" or "dear friend". How many of us are really willing to give up even one thing we love even if it means helping a whole lots of other people?
It’s kind of like Hemingway’s iceberg theory – you only see the tip of the iceberg, where the rest is hidden below the surface. One scene very early on that floored me is when the two kids, Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann and James Bentley), are sleeping in their room, and he hears her talking to a “ghost,” who talks back in a different voice, but you don’t really see anything but the back of her head from his perspective. So is she talking to a ghost, or is she really just doing voices, like he initially thinks? And when the “ghost” touches him…? That is brilliant, brilliant scare tactics right there, and it was at about that point that I realized I was dealing with something more than a garden variety horror film. The build-up to the movie, full of scenes where Nicole Kidman’s character hears things going bump in her big, spacious house, is rife with these kinds of techniques, these manipulations of the viewer, and it really shows a great mind at work here with the directing. Director Alejandro Amenábar hasn’t directed many other films, which is a shame.
What do you get when Little big Company, Lily Chic Events and Just call me Martha collaborate? A lot of fun and laughter and this lovely Christmas lunch created for baby Hugo who will be celebrating his first Christmas with his parents this year.The inspiration for the Christmas lunch came from the blue and white pottery called Delftware (Delft pottery) which is made in and around Delft in the Netherlands, since baby Hugo’s mum was born there. The luncheon was very intimate and fun with each guest bringing along a homemade favourite family recipe to share at the party.
Toll Note: Those using the E-Z Pass system get a discounted rate of $9.14, and Staten Island residents pay $5.48. There was some outrage in 2009 when the toll was raised, of course, but as we all know, you can't fight City Hall or secede :)
This supper idea was inspired by a "I don't feel like running to the grocery store so I'll make due with things I have in the house" thought.
Martin is a rotund little person who has an obsession with the movie The Human Centipede. Probably quite mentally ill from suffering sexual abuse as a child and constant haranguing by his mother as an adult, Martin's fantasy is to create his own 12-person human centipede. He sets out retrieving victims from the parking garage he works at, and his fantasy soon becomes a frightening reality.

What the hell is all of this plot doing in my Dwayne Johnson movie? Get with the program, folks – people don’t drag themselves out of the house on a chilly Thanksgiving day to watch a couple of guys wrestle with existential crises. They do it so that they can see the Rock blow a whole bunch of holes in a whole bunch of people. Thankfully, Faster isn’t entirely devoid of this type of action, and, as usual, Johnson is perfectly happy to play ball.

Once upon a time, one of my dear friends got it into her head that she wanted me to refinish a dining set for her. The fact that she lives 750 miles away from me was no deterrent to her…nor was the fact that she has never physically seen any of the pieces I have refinished. She was determined!

And menopause is making me sick. I believe it. Nauseous. My back hurts more than it has in a long time, and the exercises I do when it hurts aren’t helping. My knee pains me and today I made an appointment to go see an oral surgeon to see if he can save one of my very back teeth. My dentist said this guys puts a camera down in the gums and kills all the infection. I asked her how long I will need this back tooth for. 50 years? 40? 30? 20? She commented that if I left the office and got hit by a bus, all my dental work will have been for nothing.
“Thailand’s entrance into the ASEAN Economic Community is worrisome due to the freedom of movement labor in seven industries will have,” Pongsak told the business leaders. “The tourism sector needs to bring its labor force’s skills and knowledge in line with other ASEAN countries to prevent Thai workers from being replaced by foreign labor.

Oh, and that one adult book? It convinced me that adults aren’t any better than teenagers. In fact, I’d argue that Green and Chbosky’s characters are more real, more relatable, and more admirable than Levithan’s.

Yup! It's Stampendous! Saturday! Time to dive back into the April Recycling Challenge for the month! This month, if you recall, we are all about recycling things to use on our projects! For my card today I decided to reuse a small bit of tissue paper that came in a gift that was sent to me a super long time ago. I cut a small bit of the paper, ran it through my Xyron, and essentially created my own washi tape! Super easy and super fun!

This machine was purchased years ago from a professional typewriter repairman who has since gone out of business. Therefore, this machine works perfectly. I've put a lot of miles on it, and it still works every bit as well as it did when I got it. Looks just as good too. There are always several on E-Bay, so if you're willing to throw the bucks it will likely need to get one, I'd recommend one from a usability standpoint. And it doesn't hurt at all that they look good too.

Suzanne McLeod does a great job of explaining her world without lengthy paragraphs of exposition. I love how she drops nuggets in here and there, in a way that gives you all the information you need (but not necessarily as much as you might want), and that she does it in a very organic way. I think it’s hard to do this well, particularly when you write in first person, but Suzanne McLeod’s done a great job.

The moment I heard the story of a beginning from long ago, the city quickly transformed from a place of tourist interest to one deeply personal, imbuing the visit with poignancy I could only share from memories recounted by a tremulous voice and moist eyes, stories of beginnings that I’m told Allahabad once promised and delivered, of a persona it shaped long ago, of a personality it accepted as its very own, of a couple it introduced mutually, of a father’s force it helped gather strength from its early embrace of a vibrant youth who would later shelter many a dream of another and inspire a zest for life and lend their future a meaning.
Our little boy was delivered by c-section. He had a minor complication that landed him in the NICU for a few days after he was born in July of 2009. His birth was long awaited and full of much rejoicing. Yet with it came with disappointment and heartbreak as it hadn't looked the way that I had hoped for it to. My c-section left me in immense pain, and just trying to walk was excruciating. More than that, I was an emotional wreck still not having yet held my own baby boy in my arms.

To be honest with all of you guys, the thing with AA is that, she’s only a starlet. She won’t have the same level with people who made a name for themselves. Although AA would suit in that category (she becomes independent from her ate, btw), she can’t still prove her worth as an actress. The only reason why sumikat siya is because of numerous controversies. That’s the only way that would make her famous. She would do anything in may ways possible, to be the talk of the town.

Aren’t some folks like that? Aren’t some folks simply and utterly absolute obstacles to God’s grace? Aren’t there some people who will do nothing to make it easier on people to receive God’s mercy? The implication is, of course, that Pharisees and Lawyers actually made it harder on the man to get to Jesus. Doesn’t it rather boggle your mind that these people didn’t move out of the way so that the man on the stretcher could get to Jesus?
I am also intrigued by a new young adult novel by Nina LaCour. The story is narrated by a BOY named COLBY, who plans to spend the year after high school traveling through Europe with HIS best friend Bev. But first they take a road trip with Bev's rock band, during which Bev informs COLBY that she no longer intends to go to Europe. HE is devastated. The book has received several starred reviews and, although I've only read half the novel so far, I think I can say with assurance that this is a strong book and that young MALE readers will relate to COLBY's issues and would enjoy picking up this book.

At that time, I had no idea that there was any kind contemporary Christian music movement. I bought every Oak Ridge Boys album I could get my hands on and discovered that their music was not all country gospel sounding, but was influenced by many other styles as well. This was also when JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR came on the scene. I wanted there to be a Christian rock music genre and I became a fan of just about any pop song that related to God or Jesus. It thrilled me when songs like Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit in the Sky" hit the charts and received regular radio play. But the real contemporary Christian music scene was brewing and I didn't even know about it.

We all want to be number one, or even 100th, including authors it seems. There are so many best selling lists, but of course most of them only note the top ten or twenty and only so many can be in the top ten or twenty. Like...ahhhh..ten or twenty. But there is another ranking, a much bigger ranking and that is the All Powerful Amazon's ranking. It seems that since Amazon instituted the system 10+ years, it has become quite an obsession among both authors and their publishers and discussed in this NY Times article. It seems that some authors become a bit obsessed with their ranking, checking every day to see if they have moved from 1800th to 1700th place. And of course, as with every system someone come up with, it doesn't take long for someone to figure out how to 'game' the system.

In the chapter of Allan Sekula’s Dismal Science about his 2002 project Fish Story, Sekula talks about how major newspapers no longer cover the sea besides “stories of disaster, war and exodus,” a journalistic approach that compresses the sea into a “weirdly blasé and episodic faux-sublimity.” But his writing can also be creatively misread to describe voyages on cruise ships: “The sea is the site of intermittent horrors and extraordinary but tried expenditures of energy, quite distinct form the dramas of everyday life” (53). Doesn’t this sound a bit like Deleuze’s maritime model of smooth and striated space, where man intervenes with striation to distance himself from the threat of the sea’s formlessness?
Well, SOMEONE thought it was a good idea, and that someone was Independent International Pictures... which just happened to specialize in every single one of Adamson's films... that's just a coincidence though, pay it no mind.

But I’ll tell you, I do not want to be the country that having gotten to the moon first, turned around and said, it doesn’t really matter, let the Chinese dominate space, what do we care?

My earliest memory goes way back to when I was in grade school. Bonnie, my mother-in-law, was my fifth grade Sunday school teacher. She had several of us over for lunch after church. At one point during the meal, “Mr. Margo” was teasing us, and pulled out a $100 bill from his wallet (for the life of me- I can’t remember why). I had never seen one before, so I was completely impressed. That makes my first memory of him one where I thought he was kind, funny and … rich! Hah!

Mary from the Seattle Foodshed kindly gave me permission to publish the recipe. I have made a few tweaks to her original recipe, including pan frying the chicken in flour so that it doesn’t dry out (I’ve had bad experiences with slow cooked chicken breasts), which keeps the meat moist, and adding some extra vegetables. I find it so hard to resist adding potatoes to anything that’s slow cooked – they come out so well. Just make sure to cut them up small, as this recipe calls for a 3-hour cooking time.

Then things went south at the end of August, and have continued to spiral out of control. I won't get into the ugly details, because unless you work for my company in the mortgage business, it won't matter. This is my last week at my job - I was laid off/I quit. It all kind of happened at the same time - I quit about two days before I was scheduled to be laid off. So I'll finish out this week and start my new job a week from today. I'm very happy about the new job - it's a promotion and it's quite a bit more money. Both good things. I'm sad, though, that things didn't work out at the current place. I'm sad to be leaving my friends (who have all either quit or been laid off already, anyway), and I'm disappointed at the way my company has conducted itself since the incident.
Economically, there is no way these measures will provide a way out of the ever deepening slump. In fact, further austerity measures will only push the Greek economy even deeper into slump, pushing up the outstanding debt and making it even harder for Greece to pay it off. After falling 4.5% last year, GDP will fall by at least 5% this year (second-quarter growth was 7.3% down over last year). Unemployment is officially 16%, but more realistically is over 20% nationally (with over 900,000 unemployed). The northern region of western Macedonia, where an estimated 20% of small businesses have shut down during the recession, has an official unemployment rate of 22%. Health, education and other public services are collapsing. There is a process of social disintegration.

Okay, so where was I? Right. I've been busy. REALLY busy. I started work on Charles Dexter Ward earlier this year then midway through took a break to draw A Princess of Mars (that's right, I took a break from working on a graphic novel to work on a graphic novel - in my world it makes sense there's just less holidays) and now I'm back again on Charles Dexter Ward finishing that book off before Christmas and starting something new. It's been busy. And I've only had one book out this year (technically three books if you count The Lovecraft Anthology Vol.1 and Blankslate's Nelson). Last year I had two! But before you think for even one second I've been slacking off- STOP! I have THREE GRAPHIC NOVELS out next year, AND a mini-series (can't say anything about that just yet) and a 10-12 part weekly at some point in among all that.
ARE THERE NOVEL GENRES WHERE IT'S OK TO USE PRESENT TENSE? Yeah, actually--playing off the subject matter point, I've read a couple scifi and crime novels/thrillers where the author pulled off the present tense. However, that does not make it a less difficult feat to accomplish.

Bardi Johannsson: Bang Gang started as a duo with me and my friend Henrik (now in Singapre Sling). We did a self released 7" vinyl called Listen Baby. After that release and a couple of concerts we decided to take a long break. In the mean time I was working on some electronic music and got a female singer to sing on it, Esther. Our first two songs were signed to an Icelandic label and then licensed to East/West Warner in France. I needed a name for that project, so I called my friend Henrik and asked if it was OK to use the name, Bang Gang as I didn't think of any good name. He agreed.

I’d actually love to see a TV show based on Sela. About a week ago I participated in a podcast discussion with the World’s Best Podcast guys about how that character was sorely underutilized during the TNG years. It would be a great opportunity to see more of the elusive Romulans and get to know Tasha Yar a bit better as her mirror universe daughter discovers more about her roots.
The First Step is to extract all the remaining white meat for chicken salad. I wrap it snugly in a slightly damp piece of old linen towel (just the way they would’ve done in the old days for starched dress shirts that needed to “set” before ironing). Then it’s covered with waxed paper - or something a bit porous. Sometimes just leaving the package in a plastic bag open to the air is sufficient. Meat doesn’t keep as well if it’s deprived of oxygen. Just as you would do, it deteriorates more quickly.

The wedding was on the beach at Siesta Key. It was beautiful. Here are some of my pics (completely unedited!) from the ceremony:
Television stations and networks are also concerned to maintain audience “flow” levels, i.e., to keep people watching from program to program, in order to sustain advertising ratings and revenue. Airing program interludes of documentary-cultural matter that cause station switching is costly, and over time a “free” (i.e., ad-based) commercial system will tend to excise it. Such documentary-cultural-critical materials will be driven out of secondary media vehicles as well, as these companies strive to qualify for advertiser interest, although there will always be some cultural-political programming trying to come into being or surviving on the periphery of the mainstream media.
I forgive myself that I haven’t accepted and allowed myself to determine who I am for and as myself within the context of sex and relationship but have simply accepted the pre-programmed packaged experience of sex and relationship that has been delivered to me through society and my environment.

I am not going to dwell on DA Horizons, a business imprint, DA Revivals or DA Classics. We have explained these above and their relevance. I want our focus to be on DA Diamonds and Four O’Clock Press—the core of the Discovered Authors programs in respect of submitting authors pursuing alternative methods of publishing. If Discovered Authors cannot get Horizons, Revivals and Classics right for works which have been previously published, well, then there is little hope for this ambitious publisher.

Overall the key is this: take a risk. Try something you normally wouldn’t. A few opposites make a room feel just right. Keep your modern or traditional, but juxtaposing just a few elements enhances the style you already have. Don’t take my word for it – try it! Come into Slate with a few pictures and we’ll help you find exceptional elements to carry it to the next level. And because you can try nearly anything in the store on approval, there is no excuse to let your room sit stagnant!

If you’re a kid, it is easy for those symbols to be a seagull. If you turn those symbols upside down, the seagull’s wings flap. I worked this bird motif for a while. I had one gull flapping, I had one gull flapping and changing colors. I remember one ecstatic afternoon when I had successfully adapted the basic commands enough to do something that was not just an example from the manual. I animated a whole screen full of flapping seagulls, scores of them, all changing colors.
Method: Boil the whole potatoes in a vessel covering it entirely till it yields to slight pressure of the hand. Remove, allow it to cool, peel off the skins, and cut it into big pieces. Smear the masala powders and paste all over the cut potatoes with a sprinkling of water. Heat a frying pan and pour in the oil and ghee. When very hot, add the mustard seeds to splutter, black-gram dal to brown lightly, curry leaves, and then the onions. When the onions turn limp, add the seasoned potatoes, and fry over low heat turning over the potatoes frequently. Sprinkle in the coriander leaves just before removing from the fire.
In the late 1990's a hotelier called Peter Roberts retired and bought a property on the edge of the Dales in a village called Grewelthorpe. Somebody looking at his twenty acre garden - completely unworked - told him that it was an ideal spot for growing plants from the Himalayas. Thus an idea was born in the mind of a man who knew nothing at all about gardening.

This film is not only an excellent example of a renegade cop flick, but also the perfect example of why Eddie Murphy just totally owned the 80's. See in 1982 Eddie Murphy teamed up with Nick Nolte to do 48 Hrs., thus creating the buddy cop genre. Then in 1983 Murphy did a little comedy special known as Delirious which earned him instant fame and notoriety as a very edgy and very racy stand-up comedian. Homie was tellin' some jokes.

In 1820 Washington Irving, America's first short story writer, published "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" a scary little Halloween story in his collection, The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," along with another story from the collection, "Rip Van Winkle," is one of the oldest examples of American literature that is still read today. Set in post-Revolutionary America in the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, near the Dutch-settled village of Tarry Town, New York, the story concerns Ichabod Crane, a tall, gawky, superstitious schoolmaster who is smitten with Katrina Van Tassel, the prettiest girl from the wealthiest family. Vying for her hand in marriage is the brawny Brom Bones.

Thank you Mom for always having a plan B.
The clear fact is that the reason why French distinguishes between "sun" and "soil", between "soleil" and "sol", is that someone had the creative idea of adressing the sun in endearing and even belittling terms - a bit like St Francis who called him "mister brother sun" - which certainly no Pagan would have done, coining thereby "soliculum". And also, someone had the intelligence to see that if "sol" as in "short for sole(m)" was no good to distinguish itself from "sol" as "short for solo(m)", then "solilye" as in garbled for "soliculum" was still good for it. So, the socalled "language evolution" from Latin to French is a parallel that pretty clearly demonstrates, though not alone, the existence of creation and of intelligent choice.

With all this said, I have been sooooo bored at home. I did most of the cleaning on the 1st day I wasn't working. Today is day 2 & I'm miserable!!! I have been looking high & low for jobs. Anyhoo, I have taken it apon myself to redecorate the house. By this, I mean I've been looking online at different things to do, but I need more direction. I'm on a limited budget, so a big trip to Ikea is out of the question. I need some low budget, cute, DIY kind of things. So, if anyone has any suggestions on what websites to visit, please let me know. This would kill my boredom streak that has been going on today.

Unsurprisingly, my enthusiasm for this series comes mostly from my growing interest in farming (my parents both come from farms in Macedonia and Krista and I have a nice garden of our own at Small Pond) and my previous artistic explorations with our often disconnected relationship with the origins of the food we eat. Meeting these farmers would reinforce my opinion that they are an extremely important part of human survival: no farming = no food. Period. To emphasize this importance, I've had the farmers fill out a brief questionnaire about their farming life (how long they've been doing it, what they grow/raise, contact info, etc.), which will appear underneath their portrait.

Personally, I do not believe in Pure Evil. But nor do I believe in God and the ultimate Goodness of His Plan for all us, including the torturous path of the fate assigned to particular persons. So I'm having none of any kind of grossly deterministic consequentialism, the cynical sort included. If I had been trapped in Aron Ralston's spot, I would have died there. And if I had been in Mark Hogencamp's shoes outside the bar that night, I would not be standing here today in his shoes again, ladies footware this time around. I say it once more, these men are authentic heroes. No wonder all of his real life friends from around town are honored to be incorporated into Hogencamp's camp. I would feel just as flattered to be one of Hogen's heroes, as any heroism assigned to me could only be fictional.

Happiness, sadness, frustration, nervous, tired, anger. There are so many different emotions you can feel. Lately, I’ve been feeling lots of anger. Anger at my friends, family, sometimes even God. I know that I have no reason to ever be mad at God, He didn’t do anything. God says a lot about anger, rage, fury, etc., in the bible. In Psalm 37:8-9 God says, “Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret-it leads only to evil. For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.” God is saying when you turn towards kindness and forgiveness you will you will go to Heaven. God is never angry at us, no matter what we do, or say, as long as we ask for forgiveness we will always be rewarded with it.

I’m focusing on the positives, beginning with the most obvious: my five year old will be bilingual by the end of this school year. You can’t argue with the value of that. Instead of spending my time planning homeschooling and getting deeper in debt, I’ll be spending my time finding more work and climbing towards a financial situation that may not buy us homeschooling, but may eventually buy us some of my other big goals. I’ll officially move on from the limbo of what-might-happen to a more solid footing that acknowledges that one person can only do so much, and if that means delegating tasks (in this case, some of my children’s education) so that I can successfully achieve other tasks, so be it. And I’ll have some time alone with Bojey, to really deeply explore her interests and strengths, in a way that I’ve never had before.

Last week's get together of volunteers was really great. In planning for volunteer activities, it was really difficult finding a free location and also figuring out a way to get all of the fabric and yarns there. I finally decied to keep things simple for myself and do the get togethers at my home. However, living in New York, I have a small apartment. The lobby would have to do, and so I set up the bins of yarn in the lobby waiting patiently for volunteers to arrive.

It should also be noted that, like many modern-day Leftists Mussolini gained power through political rather than revolutionary means. His famous march on Rome was only superficially revolutionary. The King of Italy and the army approved of him because of his pragmatic policies so did not oppose the march. So this collusion ensured that Mussolini's "revolution" was essentially bloodless.

Speaking of birthdays, yours truly has a VIB (Very Important Birthday) coming up on Sunday. I am turning FORTY. I thought it might bother me, but nope. If it involves cake and presents, I am all in. Even if it means I have to get older. Actually, (tangent alert...) I feel really good right now. My 30's were great. I gave birth to 3 beautiful children, I moved back to the area where I grew up, I have friends, family, a church family that I adore....can't complain AT. ALL. Lately I have been running regularly.... which has caused me to start eating healthier... which has improved my mood and energy level too!

“He did not know how wide a country, arid and precipitous, must be crossed before the traveller through life comes to an acceptance of reality. It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it; but the young know they are wretched, for they are full of the truthless ideals which have been instilled into them, and each time they come in contact with the real they are bruised and wounded. It looks as if they were victims of a conspiracy; for the books they read, ideal by the necessity of selection, and the conversation of their elders, who look back upon the past through a rosy haze of forgetfulness, prepare them for an unreal life. They must discover for themselves that all they have read and all they have been told are lies, lies, lies; and each discovery is another nail driven into the body on the cross of life. The strange thing is that each one who has gone through that bitter disillusionment adds to it in his turn, unconsciously, by the power within him which is stronger than himself.”

We saw an endocrinologist this month. We were sent to him so he could monitor Rylee's growth hormone. After being in his office for 4 hours he told us that she was fine. He also cleared up some information for us that we didn't really understand. Rylee has some things missing in her mid brain. We weren't sure how this would effect her long term. He told us that, if it did, we probably wouldn't notice. The piece that she has missing doesn't interfere with the communication from her left side and the right side of her brain. Really the only thing he said that it might effect is that she will be able to use both hands easier than we would. He said that it shouldn't be something that we have to worry about. That was great news!

Im gradually getting back into the old routine, having been back at work this week. Im still operating on Jordanian time though and getting up 2 hours too early! Having said that, Im quite liking it as I can get on with things before the rest of the house gets up and gets going. I have just made (and eaten!) a traditional Jordanian breakfast of falafel, olives, zatar and oil, and boiled chickpeas with garlic and spices and of course lashings of yummy bread. This means no more cooking or any kind of lunching nonsense until our main evening meal. Im sure this is quite healthy and of course labour saving as I only have 2 meals to worry about! We just have some fruit and yoghurt if we get a bit hungry between times.

The summits of these mountains were not our objective on this occasion. We crossed the the Esk by teetering over the dry tops of its rapids, thankfully without falling in, and made our way back via a different, high-level path. The mountain tops were free of cloud. The air was sharp and clear and the peaks of the hills that surrounded us stood out in a continuous line, inviting one to walk along it: Scafell, Scafell Pike, Ill Crag, Eskdale Pike, Bowfell, Crinkle Crags. Not today. Walking the "Eskdale Horseshoe" will have to wait -but not for too long, I hope.
In terms of food, I enjoyed all we ordered. I ordered satay (skewered meat), nasi goren (fried rice) for my girls to share and a dish that looked like a sampler with various dishes in a small portion on a plate with rice. Some food was spicy, but I enjoyed it very much! If you have peanut allergy, it is advised to be careful as many Indonesian dishes have peanuts and sauce made of peanuts.

Firstly, we should recognize that the student suggests that the professor has a philosophical premise of duality and that there is a good God and a bad God and there is life and there is death. There isn’t anywhere in the conversation that the professor blatantly states that he believes in two Gods. If anything, the professor is coming from an agnostic’s point of view and wouldn’t have a premise of duality nor singularity because he doesn’t even believe in a God. It’s tough to make the claim that I believe that all atheists don’t believe in a God, because it seems that atheists and philosophers cannot come to terms with each other the specifics of what “believing in a God” specifically means. I say this in terms of Pantheism, which is explained well in the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. It states, “Like ‘atheism’ the term ‘pantheism’ was used in the eighteenth century as a term of ‘theological abuse,’ and it often still is (Tapper 1987). A.H. Armstrong says the term ‘pantheistic’ is a “large, vague term of theological abuse,” (Armstrong 1976: 187). With some exceptions, pantheism is non-theistic, but it is not atheistic. It is a form of non-theistic monotheism, or even non-personal theism. It is the belief in one God, a God identical to the all-inclusive unity, but pantheists (generally) do not believe God is a person or anything like a person. The fact that pantheism clearly is not atheistic, and is an explicit denial of atheism, is disputed by its critics. The primary reason for equating pantheism with atheism is the assumption that belief in any kind of “God” must be belief in a personalistic God, because God must be a person.”

“The Anabaptists spoke of corporate discipleship, but they emphasized Christ. Christ was the centerpiece. The Anabaptists were loyal only to Christ, and out of that naturally grew corporate discipleship and loyalty to one another. The Anabaptists did not write about loyalty to the church, loyalty to the brotherhood, or loyalty to God-ordained leaders. They did not make two commitments, one to the head and one to the body. Their unconditional commitment to Christ made all other commitments conditional.”*
Many in the beer loving community argue that ales below a certain alcoholic strength simply cannot cope with the perilous metamorphosis into bottled form without the aid of extra, character altering amendments (usually involving greater use of either hops, booze or both).
Kathryn Peale, the product of a New England background and a sheriff father, is the Deputy Bureau Chief in the New York State District Attorney's office. Jimmy Brogan, born and raised in Hell's Kitchen and a friend of Kathryn's since their days at Yale Law School, is one of New York's rising criminal attorney stars. Buoyed by their respective teams, these evenly matched lawyers—each with a strong streak of competitiveness, a fervent belief in their clients and an equally intense passion for the law go about creating two different stories from the same set of facts. As this up-close, behind-the-scenes look at the legal process mirrors the excitement of a championship match, it becomes evident that truth has nothing to do with innocence or guilt—at the end of every trial, the only thing that matters is what the jury believes. - ABC

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (January 15, 2010) – Mike White can’t seem to stay healthy—even when he’s not hurt.
As September approached the Armada began their transit back to Spain. While this latest attempt to defeat the English Queen and to purge England of any sign of any dogma or practice that was in contradiction to the Roman Church failed, the Spanish still had their ships and soldiers. They would return to Spain, refit and try again next year. The Spanish admiral, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, issued the command to commence the passage to Spain. The Armada would sail north, close to Orkney Island and the Ring of Brodgar, and round the northern tip of Scotland. After sailing west the Armada would stand out to sea and well off the rocky coast of Ireland. Once safely positioned they would turn southward to Spain.
Then we will know of a surety that all things do work together for good as we love Him and are the called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28).

Yesterday we went shopping at BJ's for our bulk items - Abby brought her dogs, like always. This time, she said she brought them so that the daddy doggy could sniff and find the things we needed to buy. It was cute. Abby was beside herself with excitement when she discovered that the puppy dog stuck to all the shelves in the store, and the cart, and some walls. She just couldn't get enough of it. :)

Nothing to show you yet, I just wanted a little break from paper mache, and I thought that cold porcelain might be a lot cleaner. I'll play around with it for a little while, but I think I'll be going back to paper mache and paper clay. Paper mache takes a little longer to dry, and it's a lot messier, but I'm used to it, and I know what my results will be -- usually ;-). Besides, I can recycle newspaper and paper bags for the paper mache.
...don't tell me you didn't sing in your head 'to defeat...the huns...'
Arrived at Palmetto Island State Park around 1:00 this afternoon. The roads were pretty bad getting here and things were falling off the walls of the coach that normally don't.

Revlon's Copper Penny - Another nail polish, but this one is effing beautiful!!!! It looks exactly like a brand new penny. It's kind of a half matte colour without a top coat, and with it is beautiful and glossy. The Revlon metallic polishes this season have been really fabulous.
