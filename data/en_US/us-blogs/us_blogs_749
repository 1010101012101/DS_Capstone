Any ideas how it got to be June already? Eeek, what happened to May? And April, too, for that matter? The good news with it being June already is that it's time for a brand-new Sketch For You To Try! This month, our sponsor is Stamping Bella! I'm super excited because on my mental list of images I wish I had more time to stamp with, my Bellas would be at or very near the top!
And here is a shot of her (camera zoomed out) where I am standing right on the water's edge taking the picture.
I received Year One of the two year curriculum, which included the teacher's edition and student text. Retail price for one year of Write with WORLD is $95., or both year one and two for $165; this also includes a year's worth of online support in the form of examples, writing prompts, and an online teachers forum for each year of curriculum purchased. It also offers your student a chance to be published on the site. Because the online support site is not yet live, I didn't get the chance to check it out, so I cannot say what-all will be available on the site.
I hope not to disappoint and be up and about soon enough.
You can leave now, my work here is done.
Well have a lovely day.

From lacrossetribune.com: “Our view: Jobs more important than politics” – Counting jobs — or the lack of jobs — seems to be a popular Wisconsin pastime these days, perhaps surpassed only for a few months in the fall by avid hunters obsessed with the way we count deer in the woods.
So Here are the pictures from the first page of Their Disney Mini Album Scrap Books we have been working on. Also the First Page of the Disney Photo Book I have spent many many hours creating on the Disney Photo Pass Web site. That book is not quite finished so the pictures are pictures of the Book on my computer not the actual book because it has not been ordered just yet. My Goal is to finish it this week and get it ordered.

“Emancipation of women”—that is the instinctive hatred of the abortive woman, who is incapable of giving birth, against the woman who is turned out well—the fight against the “man” is always a mere means, pretext, tactic. By raising themselves higher, as “woman in herself,” as the “higher woman,” as a female “idealist,” they want to lower the level of the general rank of woman; and there is no surer means for that than the higher education, slacks, and political voting-cattle rights. At bottom, the emancipation are anarchists in the world of the “eternally feminine,” the underprivileged whose most fundamental instinct is revenge.[16]
In this new chapter of his career, Osmin is now subjecting everyday men and women to his unrelenting, unapologetic and bizarre regimen. While the workouts are hard, the mind/body transformations are unforgettable as recruits learn what it takes to improve their lives and take charge using the tools and techniques only Osmin can teach.

My Mama loved food. Her deep south upbringing required it. Her Mama loved her and all of us with food too. With heaping tables of fried chicken, butter beans, buttermilk cornbread, slaw, collard greens, apple salad, broccoli casserole, crowder peas, jello salad and sugary sweet iced tea.
Paradoxically, we are forced to fund social programs for other nations at the very same time we are engaged in a heated debate about cutting social services and entitlement programs at home. It is a sad state of affairs that in the 21st century the world’s most strategic commodity is still being controlled by a cartel.
OK! It is a complete disaster again, the neighbor kids came over today and that's all she wrote.

Great article, Understanding the Ideological Divide Between Liberals and Conservatives: Is it Possible for Us to Get Along?, on why and how conservatives reject reality. A Bush Administration official derisively referred to the opposition as “the reality based community,” implying that Bushies were not reality-based. Of course they were not. Ideologues never are.

Then I went to the link & started to flip through the EIS. It starts out with some of the more palatable options: Mowing grass, falconry, etc. Then it really gets going: Removing trees & shrubs & destruction of freshwater wetlands. PlaNYC is putting trees all over the place to absorb storm water. But the Port Authority is permitted to do as it pleases. In the Bay, where there is a huge problem with storm water run off already, the airport is REMOVING trees & shrubbery & filling freshwater wetlands!

The Edenton Peanut Company was established in 1909 by members of the Wood and Shepherd families. By the 1930s, Edenton was the largest peanut market in the state and the second largest in the world. During World War II, Mr. James Wood of Edenton served as the president of the Edenton Peanut Company. Wood, for whom the company’s flagship product “Jimbo’s Jumbos” was named, shipped five-pound bags of peanuts to every service member from Chowan County he could locate. Many wrote thank-you letters back to the company? some to Mr. Wood, some to other company officers, and some just to the company. The collection contains thank you letters written in June and July 1943 from men and women stationed at bases across the United States. The letters contain descriptions of service life, geography, and social interactions of the time. (29 letters)
I tried calling my hot tub friend, but I knew her plane wasn’t arriving until 8:20 p.m., if it did arrive on time in this time of many travel delays. I called my husband who was on his way home from an out-of-town trip. He wouldn’t make it for three more frigid hours.
Exercise your right to peaceably assemble; occupy public space; create a process to address the problems we face, and generate solutions accessible to everyone.
Now, some of these issues are indeed economic ones. And it is totally cool to talk about the economics of children, the economics of families. It is important to do so, in fact. But boiling kids down to economics is wrong, just like it would be wrong to claim that society is a purely economic institution. There are human needs that are not all about the bottom line, and that is okay, and people should not have to choose between economic survival and their other human needs. Yes, like all people, children do function as economic actors in many ways, but that doesn't make them "goods" or "pets" or "luxury items." When people start talking about kids as if they were things, those people are demonstrating that they, not children, are outside the realm of civilized society.

So what we have here is a horny killer-robot in space trying to fuck with Farrah Fawcett and Kirk Douglas in silly pants. Yeah, that’s it and if you expect more than so you will be very disappointed. But the movie itself is quite good-looking and sometimes the sets have that stunningly cool seventies vibe that seemed very hard to stay away from during this time (the mother of all movies like that is the awesome Logan’s Run of course). Plagued with problems from the beginning, a Kirk Douglas who really wanted to prove to everyone that he wasn’t 64 years old and a slightly confused Farrah Fawcett. The only one taking his role serious is Harvey Keitel, which make him seem to appear in a completely different movie.

Now, this week, the nuptials of Diana's son, William, and Kate Middleton. It is great fun for many, I am sure, but I do wish the news media would refrain from referring to their relationship as a "fairy tale", which of course it is not. I hope it all goes off without a hitch and that the son will be luckier in love than his mother.

Battery life is the main one. It’s a tough debate because with that much power on board, what are you going to do? Reduce the power of the system or just put up with charging it more often? Sony has found some kind of balance, but ultimately there is no escaping the disappointment on this score.

I quite like having anthologies because if you open one randomly you’re not absolutely sure what’s going to crop up, which can lead to pleasant surprises. But they’re also unsatisfactory to read through from cover to cover because there are huge differences in style and substance that are difficult to adjust to on a poem-by-poem basis. Random access is definitely better than sequential for this type of thing, so rather than attempt to study it all, over the last fortnight or so I’ve been taking regular dips into this particular collection, and very interesting it has been too.
Even more important than your casual shoes are your dress shoes. They most likely won’t see as much wear, but when you have them on their importance is that much more. So making sure you have the right pair is crucial.

The Lord of the Rings is an artistic endeavor. J.R.R. Tolkien had no intention to commercial success. His livelihood did not depend on the success or failure of the Lord of the Rings. He was already well employed as a professor of linguistics when he wrote the book. His intention was purely artistic, even if the publisher’s was commercial. So if the publisher demanded a new ending so that it will sell better, Tolkien could very well make an argument for artistic integrity. Becoming a best seller was not his intention, developing an alternate mythology for England was. Tolkien would have pulled the book from publication if he thought the demands of change were too much.

It might be too big to define the act as bribery, so look at the bigger picture of corruption. The abuse of power by having Perbadanan Kelantan under the name of son-in-law for personal gain to perform hajr. Does it looks simple?
Getting noticed among the millions of other people all trying to also get their song on the fucking True Blood soundtrack or whatever. Most of the people making music right now couldn’t tell you the reason they are even doing it. I will go on record and say that 85% of the people who are writing songs shouldn’t be. They should be hiring guys like me, and Richard Buckner, and Simon Joyner, and Tim Bracy, and Jerry from Black Swans…people who know how to write, and then the rest of these bands can stick to what they know – playing guitars, and preening, or whatever. I’m happy to leave the interviewing and the photo shoots and the autographing of records to someone else and just do the one thing I’m slightly good at. I’d be very happy to be the JD Souther of indie rock. Or the Desmond Child. Take your pick.

It's a mix of Southwestern colors and it's the same color scheme that's on the model of my home (shown below) except that my front and garage doors will be the bottom orangey-red color instead of brown.
As the crowd slowly dwindled down, we decided to head back home. I think the bar we were at was staying open just for us because once we walked outside, they turned off all the lights and left, too! Outside we had a rock, paper, scissors battle for the change from the ticket. Ryoto, our Canadian friend Claudia’s boyfriend, ended up winning. I think that Claudia claimed the prize, though, since she had actually paid for his meal.
I have the unbelievable luxury of being able to pluck a horse, today Sovereign, from the pasture and slip on the bitless bridle and hop on bareback and head out for an hour ride. My mother was watching me slide on Sovey recently and she remarked that I don't know how lucky I am to have horses like this. She is right, I am lucky, but I do know it. I am SO grateful! I had ideas and goals about how I wanted to ride and these three horses evolved with me into my dream horses.
I am lucky enough to have a program called "Project Connections" at my school. During this time teachers and I team teach about about a subjects they are working on in class. We infuse art with all subjects! Teachers sign up a week or two in advance for a lesson. Sometimes teachers have an exact idea of what they want to do but need a little help organizing how to do it and are not sure what materials to use. Other times they tell me they are working on a particular subject and ask if I have any ideas for lessons. Together we come up with a lesson for all types of learners!!

I can't believe it's already 2012 (3 weeks into it even!). I've been crafting forever. I played for a while with wood crafts (bought the scroll saw*, the band saw*, the power sanders, etc.) more than 15 years ago. I still see some of my Christmas or "school" items in friends' homes and classrooms. =) Thank you to my very first customers!

We all gathered around the dining room table visiting and eating yummy hamburgers and sausage that my brother grilled, salad that my mom and I prepared, and chips and drinks that Kristin and Lee picked up. It was a team effort...and low key fun. We finished the meal with gifts and cards to celebrate the mothers at the table.

“Thank you, God,” Mister Rogers said.
God, how true is that? The Muse has been known to go silent for long periods of time when I blow off my work for something else, like closet cleaning or sufficient house maintenance to keep the health department at bay. As I look around this room, toys, baby wipes, sippy cups, a dishtowel (a dishtowel?), hair bows, books, and another dishtowel (how the hell did two dishtowels find their way into the living room?) cover this floor. The room smells funny. Everyone could use some clean underwear; I’m thinking we may have to all go commando. The Muse, however, had been keeping me busy. She’d been right there tapping me on the shoulder, whispering profane things into my ear.
They mound near the ground in early growth; then the slightly hairy stems reach upwards to 3 ft (0.91 m) in height during flowering. The tiny blossoms may be rose or lilac colored, or a creamy white; they flower from June until October. Yarrow blossoms grow in flat-topped composite clusters at the top of the stems.
I think it’s safe to say that FTK has made an impact on all those who have come in contact with it. Whether the impact was big or small, good or bad, FTK is growing and making a difference in the lives of many.

It began when a group of men persuaded a friend to take them around by boat. As they all differed in opinion about where they wanted to go it was decided they would each rent a boat from their friend and go their own way.

Most of the people there in the streets before the Keep appeared to be an average citizen of the newly rebuilt Stormwind. Tradesmen and women who would sell their goods, or people who provided food and drink to the workers, room and board to the travelers from afar. Indeed, nothing seemed to out of the ordinary except for the fact that a good portion of the people there wore red ribbons. On their arms, in their hair, around their head; this was the mark of the workers, the members of the Stonesomething guild who had crafted and shaped much of Stormwind to make it even more glorious than it was in the past. Today was as much their celebration of triumph as it was the people of the Stormwind’s kingdom all together.

Clearly, there is a great deal of activity taking place that seems to be partially designed to elicit anger, worry, fear and envy and the potential does exist for a human being to take advantage of these dark forces if they hold the keys of knowledge to do so. To people like Crowley, the HGA was an divine entity that allowed a magician access to the skills, wisdom and power of non-human beings. This is only one version, however.

Tyra Collete (Adrianne Palicki): The second most interesting character on the show for me. She’s the “bad girl” who is currently attached to Tim Riggins but seems to be open to just about any guy she finds interesting. She has a real problem with Lyla Garrity, but I think that has more to do with jealousy than any actual past event. She’s going to be an instigator, I can feel it.

The only two performances that I think actually brought something here were the ones given by Tom Wilkinson and Dev Patel. Wilkinson gives this very sweet, charming, and mysterious performance as a dude that always seems up to something but it’s not quite known and he plays that up perfectly. Patel is also very spirited in a role that sees him bringing out a lot of comedic energy in his performance, as well as always bringing me a smile to my face even if his romance seems to get very stupid and non-meaningful. Two good performances still don’t make up for a whole bunch of lousy other ones though.
Someday I'll write about that experience and how it impacted my life as I have all the letters to the editor, the newspaper articles and my journal from that very difficult time, but not yet. Off my soap box for today. :-)

For the question of duty cycle I transmitted an idling MFSK16 signal at 100W into test load and using an infrared thermometer I monitored the temperature of the switch-mode PSU and of the rear panel of the IC-718 transceiver. A sequence of 10 minute transmissions, with 5 minute receive periods, was done for an hour. The PSU case temperature rose from 23.6C to a maximum of 32.2C at which point the internal fan came on and the temperature fell to 28C over the next minute. The IC718 rear panel temperature rose from 26.9C to a maximum of 40C, and stayed reasonably steady from then onwards.

The Superstars Writing Seminar delivers a big dose of reality. Seven major authors got together to tell us what their world is really like. Although breaking in and making a living as a writer is not as impossible as we've been led to believe, it does take a certain mindset and a lot of hard work. It is a job and a lifestyle. It takes hours of practice, years of preparation, and a good business sense. As the sole proprietor of a small business, you must divide your brain into two parts. The artist and the marketing department. Feed them both. Many wildly talented people never make it because they only want to be artists and starve in a garret and all of those romantic notions.

During her last 12 years she was without the faithful support of her husband, for James Mott died in early 1868. She herself lived to the age of 87, active to the end, publicly & privately, in good causes. She died at Roadside & was buried beside her husband in the Fair Hill Friends burying ground in Germantown, PA. For more than 50 years she had dedicated herself to emancipation -the emancipation of the Negro from slavery; the emancipation of American women from an inferior status; the emacipation of the human mind from narrowness in religion. Starting from the equalitarian & libertarian principles implicit in the Quaker faith, she had broken through sectarian walls to become not only one of the first but one of the most consistently effective women every to play a major role in the American reform tradition.

Nunez-Tesheira is now alleging that the Integrity Commission failed to properly notify her of exactly what possible charges have been notified to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

And these dioramas don’t merely feature random groupings of figures, with, say, Americans in khaki over here and Germans in grey over there. No, every grouping is based on historical fact, on accounts of what actually happened in the battle. The St. Etienne diorama, for instance, not only shows German trench placements, including underground bunkers, observation posts, and machine gun nests, it also depicts such incidents as French military police turning German prisoners over to the Americans, an American mowing down a group of Germans with a Lewis gun, and a squad of men standing alongside the village church, praying over the body of a fallen comrade. It’s little details like that that really breathe life into the scene.

The problem is she landed in purgatory. And while it's not a fiery inferno, it's certainly no heaven. It's gray, ashen, and crumbling more and more by the day, and everyone has a job to do. Which doesn't leave Velveteen much time to do anything about what's really on her mind.

It's that time of year again. you've overindulged and about now you are swearing to never eat sugar again! Oh how I remember those days! I have family and friends asking me left and right what to do to detox their bodies. It is really hard to find a plan that works for everyone and that's because the same thing doesn't work for everyone...... most of the time! The good news is that if you reduce your intake of acid forming foods you'll have a better chance at winning the battle. The good, good news is that alkalizing foods are the same for all people. I thought I would give you a cheat sheet of alkalizing foods and acid forming foods. If you stick to the alkalizing foods you will reduce inflammation and be that much closer to more energy, less bloating and maybe we'll drop those darn holiday pounds : )

I'm a little confused - there really wasn't anything wrong between us. It just wasn't working out, and that's hard to accept. I think it might be easier if there was a big fight, or a third party, or an issue you just can't resolve. But this just...wasn't any of that.

I found her in the Orgrimmar orphanage. It was starting to get dark, and she and Matron Battlewail had the kids gathered around…while she read to them. Talbuk Luck. Of course. She was even doing her goofy Tahri the Talbuk voice, which was cracking this little troll girl up especially. She read through to the end, this silly sing-song rhyming story, and when she finished, Gurtash hopped up and shouted “Epic verse!”

Perhaps the mood was created by the horses at the front door. Or the rustic brick and stone structure itself. Maybe candles were the secret ingredient. Or was it the hospitality and presence of William and Miranda? Most likely it was a combination of all of those qualities.
She pummeled me with fake food. I was beaten.
Every circle has its end.
The judge was much impressed by "the public interest that lies in having and operating effective extradition procedures", but seemed wholly unmoved by the human cost of such streamlined administrative processes on individuals and families caught up in them. Nor did he seem to care about the violence to the rule of law and to basic civil rights that inevitably follows. But in any civilised legal system the rights of individuals must outweigh the convenience of the system. Humanity matters more than efficiency. It is absurd and outrageous that basic and sometimes ancient protections (such as the right to know the evidence against you, the right of habeas corpus and to bail) are set aside when the word "extradition" is invoked.

I was given that chance when I was assigned a story about the past, present and future of the building. In the course of my research I was treated to personal tour of the building from the Preston Castle Foundation president. As he led me through the huge building, I couldn’t help but think that although it was in need of a lot of work, it still retained its beauty and grandeur. It reminded me of a slightly disheveled cousin of the Biltmore House in Asheville, North Carolina, which was built by George Vanderbilt, one of the industrialist giants around the same time.
Poison Ivy… same reaction. I got a big dose of poison ivy while doing some yardwork and my arms and legs were covered. Quite itchy & bitchy, again I was up a few pounds and knew from my swollen fingers what caused it.
The Handbook contains the usual recipes one finds scattered throughout other books on preserves. It has, for instance, recipes for fruit butters, for chutneys, herbal vinegars, marmalades, jellies, jams, and pickles of various sorts. For those who just can’t keep booze out of the kitchen, there are syrups, sloe gin, elderflower cordial, sage elixir, and a rummy shrubb or two.
After a month long hiatus, it's time again for The Secret Recipe Club again. This month I was assigned Miz Helen's Country Cottage. Miz Helen is a southern gal living in Texas and shares her simple way of life. Her style of cooking is different than mine and full of southern influences, things that I'm not familiar with like black eyed peas and hush puppies, just to name a few.
But this arrangement was in breach of Parliament’s rules, which do not allow party-political fundraising in the House of Westminster, and Mr Cameron was forced to ‘unreservedly apologise’ after he was rebuked by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Sir Philip Mawer.

Bloody revenge
No one had seen what he did. No one else knew what went on in our home. In public, around friends and neighbors, he was laughing and playful. Many times people told me that he must be so much fun to live with. What a great sense of humor. You must laugh all the time.

Now I fell into the trap of asking “yes/no” questions. But Santa threw me a bone and added, “But I’m the airport Santa.”
I crossed the lot and arrived at my perceived obstacle ready to face it head on only to find a path right beside it. This path was quite literally a dry clearing under the umbrella of a big tree. Crisis averted! I was a little bit smug with satisfaction and quick to celebrate my triumph over doubt. That is when the message from the universe came to me loud and clear.
I recently saw someone on Facebook use "peek" instead of "pique." Yeah. If your interest is peeking, please stay away from my windows.

Last week I asked all of you which play by Shakespeare I should read this summer. And the winner is Macbeth. I’m really excited to read this one since so many of you said that you loved it. Thanks for all of the votes! I am hoping to catch some productions of Shakespeare’s plays this summer in London. If any of you know of some please let me know. It would be cool to read Macbeth and then to be able to attend a live performance.

These are some of the things that I noticed.
"I opened the door to Prescott and showed him in. It was the first time I’d met him. As he came through the door, he pushed me quite forcefully against the wall and put his hand up my skirt ... He was just trying it on. ... I just rebuffed him politely. He shrugged and winked and we all carried on"

This isn't the story of why I write romance. This is about why I love happily ever after endings and the thought of putting two people together. I'll sum in up in one sentence for you: Life is better when you have someone to share it with.
How has your background influenced your writing?
These are not the result of college degrees, career tracks, promotions or networking. They are not measured by Forbes or The Economist. They are measured by the only one who really matters in the end. And when He calls me home, maybe sooner, maybe later, I want him to tell me I lived up to my potential.

The next interesting thing about Cujo is that it has no chapters whatsoever. The book starts with “Once upon a time”, things start going, and it never stops until the end. Fortunately, there is an extra return space between paragraphs when the scene changes, so it at least gives a nice breaking point to leave and come back to. But, not having chapters, or any other mark indicating a break, is pretty rare. Especially for Stephen King. Most of his books not only have chapters, but have numbered sections within the chapter to even further break things up. I’m not sure what the reasoning for going chapterless was, but it does make the whole story kind of flow a little differently. It’s like one big long narrative of what happened “Once upon a time”. I know of only one other book that King wrote without chapters, but I won’t say which one it is until I get to it (but if you want to take a guess, feel free in the comments. If someone gets it right, I’ll give them 5 bonus points).
Your viewpoint shapes your thoughts, decisions, actions — and ultimately, your feeling of success. For example, have you ever wondered why people in some of the poorest parts of the world seem happier than those in the wealthiest nations? It’s probably because they view life through the values-lenses of health and family versus wealth and fame. Of course, those choices are not mutually exclusive. However, if you lose the latter you can recover, if you lose the former you’re truly lost. Remember a time when your perspective changed dramatically, such as falling in love or a death in the family. In an instant, your orientation shifted. What you placed in focus was different. The world may have looked brighter, or dimmer. You may have been prompted to action. If you just welcomed the birth of your first child, for example, you may start thinking about the quality of the local school system or have the impetus to leave work earlier.
I mixed up my take of the Pisco sour for the photo. In spite of its jizz like appearance, it is not a foo-foo cocktail.

Sandra Bullock also joined the ranks of the power-red gowns in Vera Wang. I kinda like the gown from the front, but it has a big bow right on the butt. I just don't think butt-bows are a good idea. This picture doesn't show it, but her hair was a mess (it was in some sort of a ratty/lumpy updo that I didn't like).
Paul McCartney, Beatle, is responsible for some of the most outrageously beautiful songs of all time – Yesterday, For No One (quite possibly my favourite Beatles song ever – certainly in the top five), Hey Jude and Eleanor Rigby for example; he also wrote some of the Beatles’ best rock tracks, including Helter Skelter, Get Back, Paperback Writer and the greatest opening track to a debut album ever, I Saw her Standing There.
“Of course, of course,” he answered (he seemed to be averting the topic), “But surely you need to talk to the witnesses first?”
I have been out of academic circles for a very long time. Probably Ian, who last I knew was at Berkeley, making a brilliant academic career, has had a hand in this remarkable literary ressurection. I read Powys when I was perhaps 20 years old, a dusty library book called A Glastonbury Romance, picked nearly at random off the shelves, because anything Arthurian, in those days, had huge magnetism for me. I read the book in a trance. Much of it was beyond me: it teased and disturbed. I was well aware that I had a bigger fish on the hook than my line could stand.
The study ‘Born Too Soon: The Global Action Report on Preterm Birth’ that was released on Wednesday ranked the US 131st out of 184 countries — between the Congo and Nigeria, and tied with Somalia and Thailand.

As a new client emerges, Ray finds himself in an impossibly large boardroom holding a check with enough zeros to finally lift him from his financial pit. The job seems easy enough: find Logan Ramsey, an ex-cop turned security officer who’s taken off with sensitive corporate information. But few things are easy in Ray’s world, regardless of the amount of zeros in the check.
My first stop looking for my new stride was finally daring to run in my vibrams. Though I love how they feel when hanging out, I'd heard such horror stories about achy calves and upset achilles tendons I'd been too scared to try. Particularly since I had a pretty serious achilles tendon injury in 2006. It was not an injury from running, but it's one of those old injuries that flare up every once in a while.
The Chemical Brothers – Further (2010): The Chemical Brothers are back, with an album that definitely ranks high up in their discography. The first two songs, “Snow” and “Escape Velocity,” complement each other perfectly and set the tone for this excellent house recording. Catchy beats and good use of layers and dynamics make this a fun album through and through.
On Sunday we went out to do some driver's training.
There has been many a quiet tear shed in the last few weeks... in quiet moments, just me and my girl.. in our special booboo chair. The place that I have sat and not only fed, but held, rocked, soothed, and cried with my baby when I could not ease her pain, for 2 years now. And there are more tears now, as I sit here.. tapping away at the keyboard.

It's a very different environment from my (and most) martial arts schools in my experience. For starters, it was an entirely male group--no women at all. And the guys mostly looked like my buddy The Hulk--big biceps, oozing strength. My build is more the lean, mean fighting machine--well, lean, in any case. It was a bit intimidating, I must say.
Stephen is dragged in front of the Sanhedrin (the Jewish ruling council) and is accused of speaking against the temple and Jewish traditions and advocating the teachings of Jesus who they believed came to change the customs handed down from Moses.
As far as attaching the sole to the body, what you want is called Goodyear construction. All you really need to know is that the upper is attached to the sole in a way that allows you to have a cobbler replace the soles as they get worn out. With your cheap brands, if your sole wears out the shoe is done. You’ll also see a lot of detachment of the upper from the sole in the cheaper shoes as well.
And so, shameless hussy of an illness-tart that I am, I’m bloody well going to exploit it. I mean, hell, I’ve paid my taxes, I’ve been a good citizen, and I’ve sure as shit got a few extra quid in the karma account. Hence, I’ve been embracing the shiny new services like Imogen Thomas embraces a chance to get on telly, and being every bit as brazen with it. This isn’t just The Bullshit, it’s The Bullshit iOS 5 – which I chose to match by turning up to this week’s clinic not with a notebook of questions to ask, but an iPad onto which I could simultaneously type the answers as The Curly Professor spoke.

Studio Sýrland was founded in 1988. They have 2 recordings studios. The second Album by The Sugarcubes, "Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week" was recorded in the studio, designed by David Hawkins (who worked for the Abbey Road Studios). Many of Iceland's greatest artists have recorded @ Stúdíó Sýrland. The second studio in Skúlatún 4, Stúdíó Írak, is Iceland's only specialized mastering studio for CD and DVD publications.
Great tenors can bloom in strange places but Gardar was born to sing. His sister Nanna a soprano is a professional opera singer and younger brother Aron is currently studying to be a baritone. His English mother Krystyna, a concert pianist, was a piano student at the Royal Academy of Music when she married Gardar Cortes senior and moved to the north Atlantic. Cortes's father was a world class Tenor in his prime with Domingo actually stepping in for him once when he was too ill to perform.
Formed back in early 2002 in Wakefield‚ The Cribs‚ twin brothers Gary and Ryan and younger sibling Ross first came to light with their debut release ‘You & I’ , a split single with Jen Schande on the Leeds based indie Squirrel Records. Following their signing to Wichita Recordings in 2003, they enlisted the help of their friend Chicago singer/avant-garde musician Bobby Conn, to record demos for their eponymous debut, subsequently spending a week ensconced in London’s Toe Rag studio capturing the endearing energy of their live shows.

My bipolar disorder is a blessing and a curse at the same time. Though it has wreaked havoc in my life, it has also made it impossible for me to tolerate intolerable situations, it makes it necessary to follow my heart. I can't fake my way through it like everyone else. I am constitutionally incapable of it. I wonder if that make sense? My weakness is my stregnth.
Before They Are Hanged is very character driven. We see far more of the world than we did before, but even through these travels – which are mainly focused on West and Bayaz' group; Glokta moves around, but we don't see him travel – the characters and their development and interactions remain key. While most characters show growth, in my opinion, Jezal dan Luthar shows the most. Not surprising as he needed to do a lot of growing up. But it goes beyond just that. He seems to find his better side and learns loyalty to other people than himself. This is mainly done through his interactions with Logen, who in his own gruff way seems to mentor him. I really liked the group dynamic in this party of misfits and I do wonder where they'll go in the final book of this trilogy.

4. Now press your seams to one side or open flat. You can press your seams all in the one direction or press darker fabric seams away from the lighter fabric. It's up to you. I like to go darker or patterned fabric pressed over to the darker fabric side or which ever way the seam wants to go. Repeat for all of your rows and be consistent with whether you're pressing open or to a side.
“And at that time – this is something that art historians and anthropologists know about – people were much less used to seeing images. They were rare and regarded as much more special than they are now.
One of these days, I'm going to write an actual blogpost....not just write about good deals I find on the internet. But there are so many out there! Today, Bart and I are going to Tanger Outlets to each get a $50 giftcard for $25....again, perfect for Christmas shopping! That was a Facebook deal that I got earlier this week (sorry, it's no longer available). There are just so many great coupons/deals out there to take advantage of.....and for someone who hates to pay full price, it's a dream come true!
Another activity to go with our theme was to actually act. We created a box of random items (toys, toothbrushes, sunglasses). Each girl selected one item and stepped into a team. Now they had to make a short commercial about all three products. This was great because they were all creative and sat in their groups to work (one team scripted it). We also did a fashion show where they were fashion designers with hats and scarves. We re-purposed the red carpet to be a cat walk and took their pictures.
Something was not making sense. What do you do when what you understand no longer matches the reality you are trying to operate within?
Feeling an unavoidable kinship at her situation, I laughed a little which did not sit well with her. “No problem ma’am, would seventy-five cents put you over the top?” I asked.

The SAFMA and the SAMC called on the governments in the region to commit themselves to supporting and expanding press freedom and the free flow of information in the digital age. “New media have enabled people to bring about massive social and political transformations. Yet, media freedom is fragile, and it is also not yet within the reach of everyone. Furthermore, as more reporting is transmitted online, more and more online journalists including bloggers are being attacked and even killed for their work,” Mr. Alam and Mr. Ketkar said.

Which brings me to my next point: have you ever tried a grilled avocado before? I’m sure you’re looking at me with a twisted expression of combined disgust and curiosity, but let me assure you that this is one fruit (yes, it’s a fruit) that loves to be thrown on the barbeque. Because of its soft, dense flesh, avocado seems to soak up that smoky grilled flavour almost better than any other veg I know. Plus, grilling brings out an unexpected nuttiness that a fresh avocado just doesn’t have. Try it friends, you’ll thank me.

The first segment of this three-hour Monday Night Raw was allegedly going to be the contract signing between John Cena and Brock Lesnar. As you might have predicted, that didn’t happen. John Laurinaitis came out only to be bombarded by an unfriendly crowd. Laurinaitis announced that, because Lesnar was late, the signing would be postponed until later in the night when Brock would show up. While John Cena stood perplexed in the ring, a shocking Hall of Famer returned just seconds after Laurinaitis’ announcement to give Cena a few words: Edge. Edge made his way to the ring and proclaimed that the John Cena in the ring wasn’t the John Cena that he once remembered. As Edge continued to give Cena a talk, the more he stressed to Cena that he has to win his match at Extreme Rules. The Rated R Superstar then abruptly left the ring.

Michele Bachmann: “I think that they recognize that the support has really dropped out of their campaign because of those questions. … When it came out yesterday, everyone said this is it, he’s done. … People just don’t see that there is an ability for him to be able to come back after that.”
Another cool aspect of unschooling is that Liam owns his own learning process! Truly, we all ultimately own the process for acquiring the skills we have, but chances are that we may not know it. Many of us have been led to believe that someone else, someone who may or may not even care about us, deserves credit for the things we learn, a la the bumper sticker that pontificates, "If you can read this, thank a teacher." What a load of crap we have bought into! Sure, we can be helped (or hindered) by other folks. But the responsibility and the credit for learning the things we learn, no matter what the venue, fall squarely to and belong solely to the learner, not the so-called teacher!
Scholars and historians argue that blackface was about creating a white identity that existed in contrast to Black slaves, and asserting power over Black Americans by relegating blackness to defined, extremely stereotypical character tropes. This was done through minstral shows, where whites painted their faces with black paint to perform.

Really, having had a few days to think about it and remember how much fun it was, I so want to move down to London and be involved in those kind of events all of the time.

The octopus inhabits many diverse regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the ocean floor. They have numerous strategies for defending themselves against predators, including the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and deimatic displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, and their ability to hide. An octopus trails its eight arms behind it as it swims. All octopuses are venomous, but
While this won’t make everyone happy an epilogue was something that at least I feel that is necessary.

After church I could catch a bus that would take me down Wisconsin Avenue and into Georgetown so I decided to give it a try. This trip went much better...thank goodness! When I was researching my trip I looked at a lot of guidebooks and one had a 90 minute/3 mile walking tour of Georgetown that I made a copy of, and I had it with me so I decided to follow it. It is beyond me how they thought this tour would only take 90 minutes, and I think it was closer to 30 miles--not 3. Did I mention it was also about 95 degrees? I decided to do it as a scavenger hunt and take a picture of each location as I found it. The directions were good, and I am proud to say I found everything. Here is the list of what I saw and I have the photos to prove it! :)
Few people say money, beauty, power, or fame — though since it is a Buddhist meditation teacher doing the asking, there is probably some self-selection going on. Putting those answers together — or reading them one after another like a kind of talking poem — evokes a feeling that I would call spiritual. Those words point to spiritual matters, and they are indeed important — to everyone in every society and culture. We are united by these universal aspirations; together they serve as a description of a life well lived, a life oriented toward wisdom and a higher purpose.

Take a look at yourself. What are your skills, what do you do best, who are you when you're able to be yourself and not responsible to the expectations of others? What are the most basic qualities you possess which you feel you can be proud of, which you feel may be of benefit to others in your environment? Is what you're doing right now enough to make you feel happy and fulfilled, leaving you with the feeling that you are making a positive difference in both your own life and the lives of others? Do you know makes you happy, or have you put those ideas aside, defering them for a fictitious future where everything will be better? Whatever you do, stop the wishful thinking and come back to earth.

It turns out that Becca isn’t her real name and that she’s a graduate student studying male behavior. The tape of Matt practicing on the blow-up doll becomes a viral sensation and Matt locks himself in his room for two weeks, completely humiliated. His friends try to get his favorite porn star Sunny Leone (herself) to help out a fan and she agrees to – for a price. The quartet and their friends raise the funds and it looks finally as if Matt is going to lose his cherry to a porn star. What could possibly go wrong?

On the way to our destination we stopped at the Suntory group beer brewery. Here we were able to learn how raw agricultural commodities such as rice, barley, and hops are converted into their local beverages. As there is no set drinking age in China this beverage has a common market all across the nation. This brewery is capable of making over 200,000 metric tons of alcohol per year. We learned the differences in dark and light products as well as saw their packaging facilities.
Nowhere is soccer more passionately embraced than at the World Cup, and Grassroots Soccer is going for the gold there, too – with 48 Skillz Holiday Programs designed to keep 5,000 kids safe and occupied during the 6-week extended holiday in South Africa, and Grassroots Soccer teams from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia playing in the Football for Hope Festival held between the semi-finals and finals, July 3-10.
I’m assuming the whole idea is to ensure that the game code is fast enough to execute inside one whole frame, before the VBlank occurs, to keep it running at 24 frames per second. If it oversteps the mark, it’ll have to wait until the next VBlank which will reduce the framerate to 12. This all sounds awkward to me, but let’s see how it pans out when I make a start on the actual game.
A lot of people object to the strange little monster seen in the laboratory, but I think it’s a marvelous addition to the picture! I’m also pretty fond of the piranha fish themselves, who seem whipped up into such a frenzy that you’re afraid they’ll just wiggle themselves into a heart attack or a stroke! And they make a funny noise:

Of course, the fact that he cannot say what is going to happen at this point seems to indicate that SOE is watching out for its own interests. Good for SOE. I’d rather see Sigil go elsewhere than see SOE commit to a deal that might harm any of its other titles.
Another coffee, another morning, not long after. This shop is somehow even more corporate than yesterdays, unglamourous, right in the heart of Paisley, tracksuit wearing mothers taking a break their most important clientele. 1ne of the kids is throwing spoons around like javelins. No one stops him, no one even moves, and he learns to run the world through pure anarchy and noise - bit like PETA in kid form. This coffee is far more acidic, for some reason, pure early morning airport, like a practice coffee. It's gluggy. I haven't had 1ne like that since the 1ne I had at a Manchester Truck Stop just before I went to Switzerland that was just glug with 2wo sugars. I'm flicking through the paper, but it's nothing but faux controversies and sad eyed celebrities emerging from rehab blinking into the light and calling their publicist. I was glad to get out of the front of the car I was in. Why they thought I'd be the one to make conversation, today of all days, I'm not quite sure. I hate being in the front of someone elses car, so tantalisingly close to the radio but never given permission to turn it on. When that person what is driving the car - as they say in London - is flicking through their own struggling roladex of conversational topics only to settle on hows work, the desire to hit the volume and tune out even if it's only Train on the CD player is hard to fight. How is work? It seemed like a strange question - after 8eight weeks, I couldn't even answer. I was still trying to remember after my 2nd cup of glug. This 1ne didn't have sugar in it, I thought I'd try my glug pure. The Scottish way. My family of course don't speak, and I hadn't really noticed them coming in. 1ne audiciously has a glazed donut, which is weird, because I hadn't seen donuts for sale. And I'd really like a donut. On such incidents, war can be declared you know. Of course, on the day of a funeral, how can you possibly wonder about sprinkles, you can't really kick up a fuss. But damn it all, if I'd like someone to to clock little Jimmy Javelin over the head. Hell, I'd do it myself, if the reward was a donut, but such is fate, of course, the procession must move on...

A link-up with former Ferrari team-mate Alain Prost at his team for 2000 was a disaster. There were no points, with ninth and last at the Nurburgring being his best result. There were 12 retirements, the Peugeot engine kept blowing up and the car was a slow as a Morris Minor. In Austria, Alesi committed the ultimate crime by driving into his rookie team-mate Nick Heidfeld, two weeks after Heidfeld had hit him at his home race in Magny-Cours. He was happier in 2001 with a customer Ferrari engine and there were superb drives in Monaco and Montreal to gain much-needed points for the ailing Prost outfit.

My face ached from my wide eyes. My jaw drooped so low I could feel the muscles stretch in my temples. Other than that, I didn’t feel much of anything.
While I prepped dinner, we enjoyed a light cocktail that I created and named the Caddisfly Nymph (after the little water bug upon which salmon and trout feed, and an indicator of healthy streams): 6 oz of Prosecco with a half ounce of elderflower syrup (sold as Flädersaft at Ikea) and a tiny splash of Peychaud bitters (for pinkness and herbal twang). It's flora and girlishness in a glass.
When Being Human began, I thought it was one of the most interesting and original ideas for a comedy drama that I'd seen in years. A group of supernaturals - a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost - find each other and end up sharing a house while attempting to fit into human society. It's an inspired set up for a TV series. I met the show's creator, the very affable and talented Toby Whithouse (see my interview here), during the filming of series 2 and we talked about where the show could go. Obviously, he couldn't reveal too much but he said that he was looking forward to exploring as many facets of human behaviour as possible; to use his characters to challenge the concept of what it is to be human. There would be temptation, envy, lust, joy. He would write about the angst that parents suffer about bringing a child into a world where that child will always be under threat; whether to fall in love with someone who is immortal and who will watch you grow old and die; how to live alongside people who fear and hate what you are; how to be human. That is, after all, the name of the series and what distinguishes it from all of the other supernatural series on TV. Which is why, with series 4, I was disappointed by the sudden change to 'end-of-the-world vampire armageddon' story arc.

Her notes were very helpful to me, actually, and I used many of them – along with feedback from Vine Reviewers – to re-work the entire manuscript for the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award when I submitted it this year. Since Carving The Light was named as a Quarterfinalist in the contest this time around, and since the reviewer from Publisher’s Weekly who read it did not seem to abhor the entire submission, I’m thinking that all of that advice put me futher along on the right track! My plan for CTL now is to take all of the feedback I’ve been receiving, re-work the complete manuscript once again, and then re-issue the book in paperback and e-book versions again. I’m taking a break from it first, though, because I want to let it sit for a bit – and because I have far too many other things to focus on at the moment!

So what we have is 157 dark, scary and unbelievably funny pages, much of which is narrated by a man hiding under his own bed. That might not scream "rock" at first blush, but the novel is infused, in its own way and very much on its own terms, with music. Emil is a borderline-obsessive jazz fan who takes maybe a little too much pleasure in his Miles Davis collection; Havard's musical tastes run toward playing Elvis Presley's "Hound Dog" ad nauseum and, at one point, buying a ukulele for no discernible reason. Kraftwerk's paranoiac "Computer World" makes a brief appearance, too, at just the right claustrophobic time.

Currently, no one is considering placing cameras in state-run or privately owned group homes. Office of People With Developmental Disabilities spokesman Travis Proulx brings to light why: the federal government has laid out “very strict restrictions on use of cameras in homes, because that would essentially remove the privacy people are legally entitled to inside their homes.”
When one has reached the point of becoming a true candidate of Probation, one is ready to be taught and conditioned to travel into other dimensions of time / space, and to reach into and function from a higher level of consciousness. A probationer must be able to make a sound, solid commitment to the fact that he or she is on the right path and have chosen the right path in life. One gathers knowledge from all that one experiences and subscribes to, including various religions and philosophies, as truth can be found in all. No label needs to be put on one’s chosen path. Losing that “need” is real and true growth. If this is done, the intellect can block the ability to intuit. When one intuits something, one knows that what is being intuited is true.

I had a busy Saturday. Jason G, who has a big workshop in his basement & garage, wanted to try building pumpkin-throwing devices for Jessica's little event in the fall, and his girlfriend was out of town for the weekend. So we spent the morning with Dan W, digging through piles of scrap at a junkyard in the ruins of a quarry facility outside of Pleasant Gap. We ended buying about fifty pounds of aluminum and iron bars, springs and the like, then hit a tractor supply shop and Triangle Lumber over near Jason's house. We met a couple of university folk back at Jason's place - Antonios whom I know from Otto's Tuesdays, and a guy named Jim who I think was at Jason's Superbowl party this year.

Now, if the discussion moves to what Romney said in Manchester, then that's another conversation entirely, and one that probably should be fleshed out. There are undoubtedly some people who could be working who choose not to, but there also will be people who cannot land a job whether it's "required" or not. It's not a simple debate with easy answers, but that's precisely why the debate should occur. But let's not obfuscate the real problem here: a man who's never known hardship seeking advice from his long-time companion who's also never known hardship about "ordinary Americans." And the counsel-giver has never worked in the public or private sector. That is the real issue here, and it goes to the heart of Romney's judgements and critical thinking skills.

It is when I’m not in communion with the Father that these guidelines begin to feel restrictive and more like pointless rules than guidelines that lead me to freedom. I know when my relationship with God is not where it should be because the things of the world become appetizing and the fact that I can’t partake feels unfair and restrictive. It isn’t about me following rules or not, it is a heart issue; where am I in my walk with my God? Am I in an active and healthy relationship with him or am I separated from him because of my sin, guilt, shame, etc.?

Initially I thought giving drug addicts a medical solution rather than just criminalising them was an in-genius idea. Giving power to the individual and allowing an addict to make a mature collective decision about their own health- if they wanted it. My interview with Gary Doherty continued to reveal that treatment plans are not at the right standard and how un-educated staff are about drugs: “Drug addiction is a grey area…the medics believe because addiction is partially psychological they believe it’s a psychiatrist job and the psychiatrist believe that addiction can be medically treated, so they believe medics should be dealing with it. But because it’s a grey area…no one wants to touch it.”

With work starting up again tomorrow, my summer and Lady of Leisure days have come to an end. This has been one of the more enjoyable summers. I celebrated my one year wedding anniversary with Mr. Incredible, I road tripped, gambled, spent time with my family, and did a whole lot of baking. Although I'm sad to see summer go, I look forward the cold fall season (even though that probably won't be until November in Texas), the holidays, and of course the baking that goes along with celebrating the holidays. So I bid farewell to my summer vacation with a bread full of flavors that remind me of summer...blueberries and lemons.

Free-market capitalism is a network of free and voluntary exchanges in which producers work, produce, and exchange their products for the products of others through prices voluntarily arrived at. State capitalism consists of one or more groups making use of the coercive apparatus of the government… for themselves by expropriating the production of others by force and violence.

Well I'm frustrated. I wrote this post last night, did all the links and it didn't go live, in fact when I checked it didn't exist, grrrrrrrrr. Been another long night, I did venture to the gym straight from work, so well done me. I then walked from the gym to Sainsburys which is only about a 7 minutes walk, to get some coke but they had buy one get one free, so I ended up with 4 lots of 8 cans and a couple of other bits. It was at the point of leaving the shop that I wished I had driven, lol. So an hour's session and two dead weights followed by my gym bag over my shoulder and handbag, ummmmmmmm, definitely punishment. Then I had to pop by my Mum's who is misbehaving for the Carers and whilst there I get a call from my Daughter who was scrapping with my Son over Chips! Seriously, is this my life, lol.........
I'll make sure to post pictures later on!

Or, if Brazil continues to heat up, and then explodes, a wave of desperate, unemployed people may resurface as low-cost servants.
If the current government is returned as a majority, I expect to see an erosion of the services and benefits that we take for granted as Canadians. And, our Prime Minister has previously shared his personal views on sexual orientation, before it was politically prudent to remain silent. He has eroded the office of the Status of Women, and has promoted aid programs that focus on abstinence, while ignoring women`s reproductive rights. There is currently no abortion law in Canada, as it was struck down by the Supreme Court a number of years ago - but a conservative majority might try to change this. In spite of the fact that Harper says gay marriage and abortion rights are not part of his platform, I simply don`t believe him. He voted against the recent Transgender Rights bill - which was passed, but then died as a result of the election. This government is completely lacking in transparency and accountability - I don`t think this will improve if they are given more power. Canada`s human rights record has been tarnished since Harper took office, and he has taken several large steps backwards with regards to environmental protection.

Also in the United States of America they have noted the danger social networks can do for certain governments when people can get mobilized by such electronic networks. They are also aware that in case in an other country an uproar happens their own people could get to know about it and ask them to react, while other while they would prefer not to interfere and not to spend any money to actions.

So, I started by coloring the sky, as shown in figure B. I colored with my BG10 and blended it all pretty with my colorless blender, without worrying about the leaves, since there is blue in green. The BG10 is so pale I knew that it wouldn't really affect the bright green that will go over it. See how much quicker coloring is, once I didn't worry about the leaves? I tried to keep the bulb tops white, as those will be pink and the BG10 would not make the pink look as pretty.

The grotesques that are Coraline's neighbours in both worlds - Miss Spink and Mis Forcible (voiced by French and Saunders) and Mr Bobinsky (Ian McShane) - are really OTT grotesque. And there are two things that work better "visually" in the book. One is the scene, in the cellar in the original, where Coraline finds that the concept of Other Father has been unravelled by the Beldam. He tries to warn the girl but is unable to stop himself from attempting to hurt her. In the movie, he charges towards her on his mechanical preying mantis in the garden and collapses through a bridge. It's spectacular but doesn't compare with the creeping sinister, clutching, open- mouthed, eyeless figure in the cellar.

This is when help started coming in. This is where the gratefulness also came in. We had family members taking our clothes to their homes to wash them. We had people putting all our furniture up on wooden blocks to try and prevent further damage. We had a support system and a shoulder to cry on when our insurance company denied our claim, due to the "flood" and the fact they don't have any type of coverage that would have helped us in that very situation.
After our first round, we went for a quick peak at the lower level before leaving. Slipping through the somewhat discreet door at the foot of the stairs, provides a completely different level of ambiance where a small bar oversees a dim dance floor with DJ. I love the juxtaposition of these two rooms and wish Paris would offer up more varied venues like this. Happy with this discovery, we settled in for an impromptu second round. In the basement, drink options are limited to a handful of spirits and mixers for basic well drinks. I had a rum and coke. No comment.

The worldwide Irish family numbers at least 50 million (some would say 80 million). The family analogy is a good one and merits teasing out. Why not do so? Take five or ten to reflect on where you stand on being Irish. Clearly you relate to Ireland – the Motherland – but is it confined to a feeling of bonhomie around St. Patrick’s Day? The chances are it’s something more than just pleasant sentiment (everybody empathises with St. Paddy’s Day) but actually defining what may be difficult. Now may be a good time to begin. Probably the intensity of your sentiments depends on the closeness of your links. Those born in Ireland, or the next generation, are more likely to feel strong affinity than somebody whose ancestors left Ireland in the 1850s. Have you traced your ancestors? Or are you close enough to the Motherland to count as an Irish citizen?
I'm naturally organised which helps, but its based on systems I've evolved over the years. This is in part as the children have grown or changed schools so my involvement in the day to dayness of their lives has changed. I've no school runs to do any more for example, which has made a huge difference to my working day. I'm still needed to be with them in the school holidays of course - which we genuinely all enjoy - and they've said that they value me being here for them at the end of the school day. It doesn't matter what I'm physically doing when they walk in the door, just that I'm there to welcome them home and listen to their day, able to deal with letters, forms and other issues.

So, it looks like we don’t need a motive to kill someone. Wow! What a great judgement. Only in Malaysia, I guess. What happens to the basic elements of crime – “the act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty?” . This is something I learnt in first year law studies. I did not continue to study law but I remembered this element. It is the basis for all crimes, and also to ensure just punishment.

In his post Seymour writes: «Accept that you will make mistakes as everyone does. If mistakes are so inevitable would it not be better to incorporate them into your creative process and use them as opportunities to be exploited rather than set-backs or even fatal flaws in the project». I think Seymour hits the point right on. Instead of getting irritated by or discard mistakes, we as creative persons, should re-examine what went wrong, and make the best out of it, either by seeing the mistake as an opportunity to learn or actually as something valuable to incorporate in our creative process – a new opening.

September 29th AM: CureSearch Walk in St Pete
Career wise, I have experience mostly in retail and education, including libraries. I worked in a great library in Lititz, PA as a circulation clerk and a program coordinator for infants and also spent numerous years a librarian for my church. I’ve also held three jobs that command no respect but demand nerves of steel and a very thick skin: school lunch lady, 6th grade teacher and substitute teacher.
I had to take the History Capstone, and ended up having a really great time. What better way to spend a Saturday morning than in a room full of pompous ass Historians who have been trained to look an historical events and analyze/break down/make fun of them to the most thorough degree.

While FWIW was unable to reach FGG spokesman Seth Faison for comment (not that we tried) Edgar Martins, as usual, spoke for him: “It’s all a bunch of horrible lies,” Martins insisted on behalf of Faison. “Horrible! My clients were busy as little beavers, keeping track of their profits and Andres’ whereabouts – do you have any idea how hard it is to keep track of a drunken skipper on a boat that goes 39 knots and has the seven seas to get lost in? – that they couldn’t possibly be expected to watch their old friend Bernie. The man was the fucking head of the fucking NASD, for Crissake! You think Walter’s gonna call him a crook? Lose a zillion bucks in fees? Go pound sand.”

Way back in 1899, Norwegian-born University of Chicago professor Thorstein Veblen wrote a ground-breaking study and critique of "consumerism" called "The Theory of the Leisure Class."

As this suggests, the letters bear on the work most powerfully when Beckett is looking away. And indeed he is most expressive as only Beckett can be when talking about an entirely different art form. The painting of Bram van Velde is, he tells Duthuit, “the afterbirth of the unfeasible”. His art “is new because it is the first to repudiate relation in all its forms. It is not the relation with this or that order of opposite that it refuses,” he says, “but the state of being in relation as such, the state of being in front of.” In this we can recognise the remove in which Beckett’s narration operates and in which the reader experiences it.

I believe that we are currently experiencing A Moment in History, that what happens in the next eighteen months or so will determine the future of our country, of ourselves, and of our descendants. As we all cope with this knowledge (I know I'm not alone in believing this), lines are being drawn, allegiances decided. Some of us are mentally assuming crash position, some are "stocking up on ammunition" (to quote a comment I read on someone's blog--I can't remember whose, but it may have been Opus'), some are working feverishly on next year's midterm elections, and some are watching and waiting and praying. All of us, though, are, beyond any shadow of doubt, patriots. We love our country, what it stands for, what it means to us.
About 200 studies have been completed that suggest that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables protects against cancer at many sites. People who eat higher amounts of fruits and vegetables have about one-half the risk of cancer, especially epithelial cancers.
Nathan's had a slew of doctor's appointments this month and this is the first week the whole month where he doesn't have something to go to. It feels good! On June 2, we had to take him to the ER for a high fever. They never found anything in the cultures they did so they sent us home! It was quite the miracle as far as I'm concerned. We have been to the ER 6 times and that has never happened before. We got out of there just after 11:00pm and we ended up stopping for donuts to celebrate. :)
I am sorry I never sent it out and never finished it. I am still in quite the funk.. personal / marriage problems have confounded my depression.. YES I've said it finally.. my depression is back :( with a vengeance. but I have not lost hope that i can beat it again.
The original version of this recipe calls for 1 cup milk or buttermilk, but I split the difference and use ½ cup of each. The texture of the batter was lovely, and I liked the slight tangy quality of the waffles, so I’d recommend that you try the same course of action.

Once they're on the cookie sheet and ready to go, freeze them again for 15 minutes before baking. Bake at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes. You gotta watch them! They bake up really quickly. I accidentally burned a batch!
As parents we want to teach our girls starting at a young age how important it is to take care of their bodies. How eating, sleeping and exercising right keep our mind, body, and soul happy. Of course, our little girls don't just want to listen to what we have to say. Girls understand more and are willing to learn new things, if you are more on their level. Go Go Sports Girls offers girls for so many different sports and teach our girls the importance of taking care of themselves.

“The more one judges, the less one loves.” (Honore De Balzac)
With the script… I don’t know. It’s encouraging me to be really slapdash, because I can get away with just throwing a boring, poorly characterised conversation on the page just because I need a particular point to be put across. But then reading over it is so much harder. It’s like the badness is condensed into a rolling sea of awfulness.

If ever a cat should have been a Parisian, it is Harry the Many-Haired One. Harry, he loves cookies. He loves sweets and chocolates. He loves pretty boxes and fancy things and silky ribbons. And he loooooves ladies who wear black and smell like Chanel No.5.
Detlef Hagenbruch, manager of the N.R.W. section of Freie Waehler, said: “One can see that a large part of the political representatives have not understood even the basics of our financial system. They ought to have understood that it is meaningless to pump ever more money into a system that is based on debt and credit. If they had understood that, they would also know why they could not under any circumstances vote for the ESM Treaty in its present draft—if they can read the text of treaties at all.”

The Witch has some SERIOUS over achievers in her garden right now. Yes folks, its that time of year again, ZUCCHINI and CROOKED NECK SQUASH is here!! Yay says the Witch as she pulls her first veggies out of the garden. Hooray for my beloved green zucchini and tasty yellow crooked necks! My mind swims with ideas on how to prepare these treats from the garden. But after a few weeks the song changes from YAY zucchini! to UGH! more freaking zucchini?? What the hell am I supposed to do with all of these???? After your friends and family have taken on their fair share you're still left with TONS of green and yellow fruits and the usual prep method of planks sauteed in olive oil until golden brown just isn't seeming as delicious as it did 2 weeks ago.
The following day finds the Turners on top of the hill, pouring water on the campfire, trying to figure out how to catch Avram. Night falls as they continue their search. Later as Hex and the boy ride atop the hill, the campfire blazes up once again. Hex tells the boy that his eyes must be playing tricks. If there is a fire, then someone is nearby, probably the Turners.
I have so much catching up to do including two trips, one with my sweetie and one with my mom and brother. Oh and a few garden updates as well!
I can try to fix the “bad girl” in me, and I can try to free the “good girl” in me. But focusing on either misses the point. It is not about mustering up the strength to follow the rules. Neither is it about throwing the rules out the window to prove that Christians can be cool. It is about KNOWING JESUS. We get to know Him more, we fall more in love with Him, and we are transformed in the midst of it all.

The Injera- which is rather like a soft, spongy tortilla- was a nice blank slate for the flavors, and we gobbled the food down hungrily. We had a tasty spiced tea to drink- hand-blended, by all appearances- and ordered some baklava for dessert even though we were all technically full.

As we shook hands at our first meeting, you left me a piece of string. It seemed ordinary and weak. But no, it was stronger than a rope but far less painful on my bare hands. It was far more flexible than a piece of strong wire. It turned out be very long too. Following it, I had many miracles and adventures.
With tight breeches and loose morals, the horse trials circuit is a hell-for-leather chase across the magnificent parkland of England's finest country estates. Flirtation is compulsory sport; love is a professional hazard. Silver-tongued charmer Rory Midwinter is quite at home in this hedge-jumping, bed-hopping world of competitive weekend house parties. Having been born into the saddle, and with a rock star owner as patron, he has no intention of settling down. Only his long-term groom Faith has other ideas. Tash and Hugo Beauchamp are the undisputed golden couple of British three-day eventing, but their mettle is put to the test by the arrival of The Devil on Horseback, brooding Kiwi rider, Lough Strachan. Lough holds the key to Hugo's darkest secret, and he intends to use it to access his greatest rival's beautiful wife.

I checked a few spots and saw no trout. Took a few more Starbucks sips. Burnt as always. I threw on my waders and gave a quick glance to my Redington and Cabela's fly rods. Not today, boys. There is no hatch. I grabbed my St. Croix ultralight instead, and tied on a Joe's Flies Woolly Bugger. I grabbed my plano boxes full of Mepps, Joe's Flies, and Rooster Tails. Browns and Rainbows reproduce here, out of sheer evolutionary will, lack of fishing pressure, and an instinct to eat anything that falls in the water. Sounds perfect.

The physical absorption process was begun by a simple touch and was irreversible. The faces of his victims could be seen embedded in his flesh and retain their identity and consciousness for several days at least, but are also able to access the creature's own thoughts. As previously noted, the Abzorbaloff also required the use of a limitation field (disguised as part of Kennedy's cane or the cane itself) to keep his absorption ability in check.

In college I painted coolers for "fun" money. I cannot tell you how many friends I helped out for their Greek mountain weekend getaways. It was easy money for me, and I loved doing it! I wish painted coolers were still "cool" among my grown-up friends. Sure would be nice to make some extra cash. Ho hum.

The fact is there's nothing ignominious about keeping one eye on the media - and fashion - when you plan your next magnum opus.
Danielle says, “If you’re going to realize your intentions, what you stop doing is just as important as what you start and continue to do. This is where “quitting” crosses over into enlightenment. Stopping = the white space. Stopping = room to run free and create from the deepest place of being without restraint or compromise. Stopping = more time for what matters most. You know how to go, go, go. Stopping, however, is the stuff of smiling Zen masters with all the time in the world.”

Anyway, Mary wants to work with disabled kids. Oh, and she reveals that she's a nymphomaniac named Nikki... Who's up next?
I remember her dark brown hair and eyes, but not much else. I was enamored with her, entranced, and I would follow her all around the area like a lost dog. So when she suggested a new game to me, which she called “Married,” I wasn’t about to turn it down.
Heven has no idea how closely death stalks her. She has no idea what I have done to keep her alive. I fear the day she learns my secrets, finds out what I really am. But even then I cannot stop, I vow to make things right. Finally her hunter will be hunted, Heaven and Hell, faith and sin will battle, and we will be victorious. But first, Heven must learn to be what she never imagined. I know her strength is there – I feel it. If we are to overcome all odds, she must push past her flaws – her frailties – to become much more.
The only other (strong) suggestion I would offer is to make this Onion Marmalade. It's more like a chutney, in my opinion. Whatever it is, it is the perfect sweet-sour contrast to all that starchy richness going on with a turkey dinner.

I found the book interesting but it lacked the punch Laymon’s books are famous for. Several times I found myself rolling my eyes because no one in their right mind would do the stupid things the characters did. Seriously, if I was being chased by an invisible sex-crazed maniac killer, I think I wouldn’t hesitate blowing the asshole away the first chance I got. One scene I swear was put in there just so the killer could rape the two remaining females in the story.
By the time we got the final stamps and were considered Permanent Residents, we mostly understood what everyone was saying, we knew some of them well enough to say hello, get a kiss and joke a bit and when we got that final stamp, we were hugged, kissed and sent off like children who had finally passed an exam.

In 2008 alone, there were over 90,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens which is obviously stretching the nation’s infrastructure, such as public housing to accommodate all of them.
However, it was always done a little here, a little there – never all at once. This gave the cabal a false hope that they still had a chance, even as their infrastructure crumbled.
Not to forgive any despicable act committed, but could any of this backdrop help explain some of their reactions and anger? Must we reduce our views of what happened to the last 4 years alone? Could we maybe just try to place everything in a larger, broader historical context?
How do you puncture that layer? Kah Walla, a political leader from Cameroon, spoke of empowering women across Africa but added that in the United States, too, the level of female representation in politics was a serious issue.

“Love is my mom snuggling with me and my dog kissing my face.”
One example is Henry C. Roberts, whose The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus saw print in 1994. After careful study of the quatrains, Roberts came to believe that Nostradamus had infallibly predicted a dramatic event in the near future: the election of Edward Kennedy as president of the United States. (You’ll find this prediction on pages 210 and 218 of Roberts’ book.) Any chance Roberts might have had at a reputation for infallibility went away when Kennedy died in 2009, having never gotten closer to the White House than a failed 1980 run for the Democratic nomination.
It was one of those beautiful days, with temperatures around 80ºF and lots of bright sunshine.
Again, this took a while to establish, so don't be afraid to take your time. It was important for everyone to practice both sessions in one day, since that would be what we are working towards, and also for them to recognize the importance of voice levels, book choice, partner choice, etc.

And then, I stared at my now-empty mealbox, and I looked at my life; how I'd wished our family had just a little bit more cash so that we can get into varsity; how I've always had a full belly; how I'd spent; how I'd perceived it to be mediocre, average, 'not bad, not good'.
Yesterday we took note of former Reagan State Department official Elliott Abrams’ piece over at NRO that went after Newt Gingrich on his relationship with Reagan. While voting regularly with Reagan as a young congressman from Georgia, Gingrich, claimed Abrams, “often spewed insulting rhetoric at Reagan, his top aides and his policies to defeat Communism.” Abrams then goes on to cite ” a famous floor statement Gingrich made on March 21, 1986.”

All in all, I don’t think this book was the greatest. It wasn’t exactly the worst either, which is good, but it definitely isn’t on my favorite books list, or even my educational books list. It’s on the not-worth-mentioning list. I’m trying to figure out if I should look for the second and third books or not.
Mr Hafez says Labiofam has stepped up efforts in recent months to work with other experts dealing with malaria. At a time of growing pressure on donors, suspicion remains.
The God of the Bible made the human sperm, the God of the Bible designed it and it was not designed to be emptied into an area that is filled with feces, there is nothing for it to germinate with, it will most certainly mean the extinction of the human race. My belief is that if the medical community would just step forward and just would share with the American people what happens to the male anus, the problems that homosexuals have with their rectums, the damage that is done, the operations that are needed to sew up their bodies if you will, and how many of the men don’t even give these stitches time to heal before they are back out there practicing that wicked behavior. Some are bleeders, men who are not turned off by ingesting the feces of other men.
This is a strong protection for community association directors. However, some states — even the District of Columbia — have specifically abolished that concept, and have substituted a “reasonableness test.” Is the action taken by the board reasonable under the circumstances?

and no matter how much the blackbird
Sometimes I curse my parents for moving to Arizona when I was a baby.
I don't know if I can chalk this up to pregnancy or not, but I've developed a little bit of a lipstick obsession as of late. Actually, I decided I prefer lipsticks to glosses about a year ago, but the sheer obsession has definitely heightened since becoming knocked up. Lipstick still fits even when nothing else does, and it's cheaper than a handbag. In most cases. Anyway, I figured why not highlight what I'm wearing on my lips as well? Sometimes it's the most exciting part of my daily ensemble.
As I flipped through the various glossies, deciding which ones I needed to recycle, I gazed upon the editorials and was just captivated by the photography, the clothes, and the evolution of styles in the ten years worth of magazines that I have.

The thing is, it’s not like that happened in a vacuum. It wasn’t an accident. It’s what TV wanted. And the conference commissioners were more than happy to comply with the request, as long as the checks rolled in. Now the panic has set in as the numbers decline. But who’s to say that the guys who drove the bus into the ditch in the first place are qualified to pilot the tow truck to pull the bowl season out of the ditch? Does anybody really believe they’d place the sanctity of New Year’s Day above a few more dollars?

Why the large chest, the wide mouth and nostrils? There is considerable evidence that Mars has an atmosphere but it is extremely thin and the pressure is very low. Now, says Major Randolph, since air occupies more space if there is less pressure, a Martian would have to take much more air into his lungs than we do and oversize organs would result.

His 1947 film Monsier Verdour saw him showing mass murder and the abuse of workers in an attempt to increase business profits. He was not afraid and for the times was quite daring. Though he atttended Communist Party meetings, he never actually admitted actual membership of the party. He was a principled man however because at the height of the McCarthy witchhunts he never betrayed any of his friends who he knew were, and continued to support and defend them, as they were forced to testify before the House of Un-American Activities Committe ( HUAC), the tide of his popularity was turning against him mainly due to the propoganda aimed at him at the time. It is possible that his independent wealth saved him, being part owner of the United Artist Movie studio, and he himself never got an invitation to testify, the witchhunters possibly afraid of the damage a brilliant comedian like Chaplin could inflict.

The hockey stick graph is a result of the now infamous computer model made by Dr. Michael Mann (of ClimateGate fame) and Dr. Bradley that generated this hockey stick no matter what numbers were entered into the model. The model could not generate known measurements when genuine data form the past was entered into it. Mann and Bradley tried to hide the raw data so that no one could verify their claims until they were forced to hand the data for the “hockey stick” over.

Day 3 , no pool this time and just as well, it was kind of rainy . So we ventured down to the beach area because oh by the way it was Fleet Week , one of my favorite holidays! The bars were super fun , the crowds streamed out to the sidewalks, drinks flowed and live music played. Then it was time to get lunch (which happens when you aggressively day drink) so I order a vegetable fajita (delicious by the way) and a margarita (the size of my head and also delicious ) so I was talking to someone across the table when all of a sudden ..owwwww I had leaned on the skillet they tell you never to touch and let me tell you, it is hot! So whatever we move on, continue to drink and about 4 hours later we are walking home and we notice a hole in my shirt – now because you are reading this it may be obvious where this is going but several drinks later it was not so clear! – so all 4 of us were like bummer and I was like well guess that shows me for buying cheap stuff . So I went to bed and read for a whirl then decided to change finally . To me surprise my tank top underneath had a hole in it as well and then sure enough I found a burn mark in a really unfortunate place! Yikes! Lesson learned do not touch a fajita plate! It will ruin your clothes and burn you!

Unimpressed and ready to burn the house down, my best friend, Joe, gave me the name of a guy who had serviced him...er...his air conditioner...in the past. I called the guy and, because it was the first real wave of heat that we had in the summer, he was pretty booked and couldn't get out to my unit for two days. Remaining unimpressed, I waited. And sweated. Or made my own gravy. Or whatever.

Not only is her bartering project genius, but I also love her approach to life and how she challenges the idea that our day jobs are what determines who we are. It is so inspiring to see someone who places an emphasis on our lives beyond the 9-5 grind, because let's be honest, not everyone can survive as freelance artists/bloggers/consultants and for most, taking on a full-time job is a necessity at some point. Having graduated earlier this year and now properly in the workforce, it has taken me a while to get into the habit of setting aside time for things outside of work. People like Malin remind me to take that time - to go running, take a dance class, cook a new dish, read a book (thanks for all your suggestions in the last post!), start a new project.

When God calls his elect into salvation, they cannot resist. God offers to all people the gospel message. This is called the external call. But to the elect, God extends an internal call and it cannot be resisted. This call is by the Holy Spirit who works in the hearts and minds of the elect to bring them to repentance and regeneration whereby they willingly and freely come to God. Some of the verses used in support of this teaching are Romans 9:16 where it says that “it is not of him who wills nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy“; Philippians 2:12-13 where God is said to be the one working salvation in the individual; John 6:28-29 where faith is declared to be the work of God; Acts 13:48 where God appoints people to believe; and John 1:12-13 where being born again is not by man’s will, but by God’s.

Weissbier (in German, Weßbier) goes by many names: Wheat Beer, Hefeweizen, Weisse, Weizen, Weizenbier and Hefe are common variations. But proper German Weissbier, no matter what you choose to call it, is a staple of sun-dappled Bavarian beer gardens and the drinking hand of anyone looking for that frame of mind, and is as strongly connected with a particular glass as beer styles get.
And the return of Jesus is near. we should live with a holy expectation and expectant trust that God is powerful and that He will make all things new and that Jesus reigns.
Normally I will get rid of red eyes in the pictures before I post them, but today I decided that it enhanced the effect of whatever it is that Saarah is going for. This face is one that I am all too familiar with. This face, which I believe is supposed to look somewhat ferocious, tends to make its appearance when Saarah is at her most goofy. It is usually accompanied by her holding my face, and a rather obnoxious sound. I haven’t been able to determine if she’s pretending to be something, whether it be an animal or a monster, or if it’s just plain silliness. I believe it’s just silliness, but I can’t be certain.
There are any number of moneymaking contests that focus on published books. Their M.O.: a huge entry fee, dozens or scores or even hundreds of entry categories, and the sale of additional merchandise to winners and honorees. Prizes are typically things that cost the sponsors little or nothing (website features, electronic press releases, vague promises of publicity campaigns). Judges are never named--and may not exist--and, although commercially published books are sometimes declared winners, the contests are marketed mainly to small press and self-published authors.

The plot moves between the experiences of Su-Jen in a new culture and the drama in her family. The story revolves around the clash of cultures, with her family’s customs deeply engrained in traditional Chinese culture and the world outside challenging their views on life, especially for the younger characters. I especially enjoyed seeing this through the eyes of a young girl, who seems an outsider in North American culture first, and then distant from her native Chinese culture as she grows.
Why would Zell’s inability to sense the supernatural make him a danger to everyone? When I think about it, I can assume that this ability is necessary for paladins, but this is vague and confusing. Further, why would he be so dangerous to others that he is forced into seclusion? Wouldn’t having the abilities of his comrades nearby make more sense? Why can’t the other paladins help him? What’s a paladin? Paladins are Medieval champions for others’ rights, so you can’t commandeer this term without clearly giving it a new meaning for your world.

Another thing I like better about the Tag system is the voice with which the stories are read. Maybe this is just personal preference, but with the Tag system, the Dora Goes to School book (for example) features Dora's, Boot's, Map's, etc. voices. The Poingo books are read by the same voice. The voice isn't annoying to me, but it isn't great either. The Tag system was definitely better in that regard.

Review: "It's a rare album that can be an adventurous fusion of many different and unrelated roots and yet still remain true to the origins of each disparate element. This band (whose name translates as "Roots and Leaves") manages it quite well. They are a quartet from Amsterdam. Mola Sylla comes from Senegal with his voice and a number of traditional instruments. Kaigal-ool Khovalyg brings the tools and throat singing of Tuva. Bassist Vladimir Volkov is a jazzman from Russia. Alexei Levin, also Russian, plays both ancient and modern instruments including piano and accordion.What comes of all this is something far different than the usual "toss 'em in a basket and see what happens" world fusion project we are so familiar with. It's remarkable subtle, a jazz jam with cultural roots. Each artist hangs on to his heritage or interest for dear life, exchanging glancing blows of idiom and tradition, but mostly just sharing what they know best and letting the other musicians join in with their own ideas. So we have Sylla singing in a west African chant, with Khovalyg adding a long, drawn out fiddle line around it, eventually joined in by a tinkling piano or sliding bass line. It occasionally bursts into an uproarious din, with throat singing, jazz piano and African strings all tearing it up in what can be strikingly bizarre or sometimes humorous combinations.But it is the more subdued moments that actually define this recording, as each man finds the disparate beauty of the others music, lends his own idea, and then sits back as the whole ensemble creates something new. Real Life of Plants is honest, simple, and even more remarkable, recorded live."
I’m starting off the New Year like I ended 2011, by working. After a great weekend with the Hubby, family and friends in Del Mar, Ca, I am back in my office working on new artwork.

This yarn is beautifully coloured, but like the dreaded Noro Kureyon, seems to be a spun single-ply yarn, with a fuzzy feel. It is 100% lambswool....so I suspect it will felt (there is a huge set of multi-language instructions on the ball band, telling you to hand wash, do not tumble dry etc). It may be ok for felting, but I didn't get palpitations with excitement and anticipation when I thought about what to knit with it...

“There was a time, not too long ago, when the very word “Hump” struck terror into the hearts of airmen, and well it might. Gallant youngsters, and oldsters, too, had given their lives in getting precious freight to China, in pioneering this largest of all aerial transport ventures. Known as the most hazardous of all aerial routes, its jagged peaks reached 20,000 feet into the sky; its 100-mile-an-hour gales forced pilots far off course, to crash on snowy peaks or into jungles so dense they hid all trace of plane and crew.” (ATC India-China)
Funny you should ask that, because I'm actually taking a 10-day trip to Hong Kong and Bangkok! My oldest brother is a journalist in Hong Kong, and this will be the second time I visit him there. I'm looking forward to visiting the crowded colorful chaotic street markets, the temples (where, last time, tiny Buddhist monks would walk up to me, smiling and gesturing, to invite me to see other parts of the shrine -- they were the friendliest faces I saw), the surrounding islands with their hiking trails through tropical forest, and the bustling nightlife. At the end of the visit, my brother and I are taking a side trip to Bangkok, a city he's visited before, though it will be my first time. These are the destinations that have been most on my mind recently, but other places I'd love to see are India, Israel, Turkey, and Morocco. And I wouldn't mind returning to London sometime soon -- it's been five years since I was there.
The fashion styles and trends today are greatly influenced by those from earlier generations and with this country being the “melting pot” that it is, those styles and trends are blended allowing further innovation and ideas for future designs. In the 90′s vintage style clothing was popular giving peoples appearance a sense of past and present. Today fashion is more originality then anything. It seems as things progress trends are constantly being reborn for example the snap back hat, which was a trend set in the 80′s by popular ball players and actors like Will Smith in the Fresh Prince have come back into style. Another vintage trend that comes into style for women are jumpers and garments that are pinched at the waste like once worn in the 50′s. Designers who are influenced by the different fashions today are Polo Ralph Lauren and Louis Vuitton. Jay-Z, Gemma Ward, and Wale are icons that are constantly mixing the present styles and adding more individuality to today’s appearance. In the fashion world one idea births another always-leaving growth. I look forward to seeing what fashion statement are coming in the near future and how the trends of the decades will be collaborated with the styles of the future.
A large scalloped square was die-cut from Whisper White cardstock to create a base for my focal images. The stamps I used are from The Crafts Meow Telegram.

Some shreds of curly paper were added below the leaves which I was inspired by the photo from Color Combos Galore Inspirational Picture which you will find below.

One aspect of my PPE that some of the older attendees at recent classes have commented on is my practice of wearing high-quality knee pads when I am going to do anything even remotely physically demanding in training (for me, this means even square range work, since it will invariably end up including something like the "D Drill" or some "run-and-gun" work, where I invariably end up diving onto my knees). I have knees as bad as anyone's, and far more damaged than most people's. I've torn both ACLs, as well as the meniscus, patellar tendon, and MCL in my right knee, and fractured the patella in my left. I cannot afford further injury in either knee if it can be avoided, if I intend to remain physically active and pull my own weight in the coming struggles. If you have knee problems (or even if you don't and want to avoid them), invest in high-quality knee pads and wear them when you train!

For some the challenge is Father Time, as age diminishes one’s abilities. For others its injuries that are shutting down their windows. And for others it’s a changing competitive environment that has found their once dominant performances challenged by others who have risen to their level.

Before we can properly direct our attention to the pseudo-science behind the baseless scare of climate change, we should first address the far vaster and more profound liberal scientific conspiracy at work in discussions of gravity.

DA Diamond is Discovered Author’s flagship imprint—meaning—authors do not have to pay a fee for publication. However, publication comes by way of an in-house critique team who evaluate books submitted into the Four O’Clock imprint (Gold package only) as well as consideration given to all manuscripts submitted to other DA imprints. Authors signing up with DA Diamond are doing so as per standard mainstream contract and permitting exclusive publishing rights for a period of five years. Royalties to authors are due at a pretty disappointing 10% on net sales.

Oh, Dumas, I love you, but your pacing… well, let me be fair. The D’Artagnan Romances are enormous books; the third installment, The Vicomte of Bragelonne, is so huge that it’s usually published in at least three different volumes (hence the ability to read just The Man in the Iron Mask). Add to that the fact that it’s a serialized novel, having been published in installments over eight months. It’s not meant to be read all at once. But that has never stopped me before; in fact, I powered through this to get to a digital galley that turned out to have been already published, making it a useless effort. (Man, NetGalley really needs to stop lying about publication dates.) So I can’t really be objective about the pacing. But that’s not to say it’s slow—it’s a bit slow at the beginning, as Dumas catches us up with our favorite musketeers and the situation in France, but once the four reunite and the plot gets rolling, it gets rolling. It’s fatiguing in one go not because nothing happens but because everything that could possibly happen happens. What do you want—a high speed horse chase? The fall of Charles I? Exploding boats? Jokes about cannibalism? Manly, affectionate friendships? Dumas has everything. (And God bless him for it.)
Enter Chia Takeda, a first year who wants the Literature Club to help her write love notes to a boy she's fallen for. The boy in question is Shuji Kataoka, apparently the dreamiest member of the archery team. Konoha reluctantly agrees -- or, more accurately, Tohko agrees and Konoha doesn't feel like contradicting her, so he spends the next several days composing the best love note ever. Unfortunately, he tells Chia that it's just something he dashed out over lunch, so when the note goes over well she asks him to write one every day. This wouldn't be so bad if she didn't come to his class each morning to get the note. Given that she's barely pubescent, this leads Konoha's classmates to speculate that he might be into lolicon, particularly Nanase Kotobuki who becomes deeply antagonistic towards him. (This being the first volume in a series, I'm guessing she's going to turn tsundere soon enough.)

Lily has her own idea. Lily tells them she is going to get married!- They ask her to who and it turns out it is to a musician in a traveling show that passed through the town last night. Everybody assumes the worse. It was very interesting to see how the ladies talk about the possible molestation of Lily in the very reticent era and place of the story. They assume at first the musician just told her he wanted to marry her to get her to sleep with him. There is a really neat twist here and will not spoil it. It is very interesting to see how Welty shows us the very different attitudes toward Lily of each of the three women.

What is so important though is that the British military establishment went to quite considerable pains to conceal its neglect and paint an entirely false picture of what was actually provided and its effectiveness. It really does tell us something about an establishment which is keen to applaud the exploits of "the few" for its own purposes, while allowing airmen to die needlessly in their hundreds and thousands.

I really like most black jelly-based glitters and New York Minute doesn't disappoint. I love the burgundy micro glitter mixed with the larger champagne glitter.. it's such a pretty mix. This glitter was really easy to apply and it spread evenly with little manipulation on my part. Pictured above is two coats of New York Minute over Zoya Freja, followed by one coat of China Glaze Fast Forward Topcoat. The only downfall to this polish is removal.. it was a pain to remove, but with most dense glitters, that's to be expected.

I framed the card with some scrap lace trim that I had. Gives it a Victorian feel, I think, paired with the floral papers. Have a nice day!
Directed by James Whale of Frankenstein and The Invisible Man, this fantastic adaptation of the stage show brings together original performers from the 1927 premiere, as well as latecomers from the first national tour and early revivals. Irene Dunne again plays a resourceful Edna Ferber heroine (see Cimarron). Here, she’s Magnolia Hawks, daughter of a show boat captain on the Mississippi River. After she marries gambler and leading man, Gaylord Ravenal (Allan Jones from A Night at the Opera), she gives up the stage. However, when he leaves her destitute, she returns to performing and becomes a star with her daughter Kim following in her footsteps.
I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. I am comfortable with that belief. It is what the Bible teaches. It is what society has decided as the standard since the founding of the country. If I suddenly declared that gay marriage, polygamy, marrying my favorite goat, or any other type of union was legal, then I would be forsaking the teaching of the Bible and what I believe to be morally true, and furthermore I would be taking a minority position against the majority will of the people in the country.

Samson had long hair and was a womanizer
Last week Noah participated in the local Special Olympics. He competed in two wheelchair races. This year, he had moved up an age group and was racing with older kids.

Happy to just be there and determined to just finish! He makes us so proud!

The cemetery is the largest in the city with around 250,000 burials. It opened in August 1869 and the first to be buried in it were two young girls. A lot of Belfast's prominent historical figures are also buried here. They include Sir Edward Harland, the controller of Harland & Wolff shipyard at the time of the Titanic’s construction, and CS Lewis' mother, Florence. Also buried here is the 15 year old boy believed to have been the first to die during the construction of the Titanic. Samuel Scott fell and fractured his skull while working in the shipyard in 1910. His body lay in an unmarked grave until recently, when a headstone was placed in the cemetery for him.
So, it is not the objective facts you and your family must consider, but your psychological grit and resolve to be positive and realize you’ve been afforded a life-saving opportunity.

This just goes to show you how involved students are in the activities on Erskine’s campus. EEB is run by students who try to bring in bands they know Erskine students are going to love. The Mirror steps in to get student’s questions answered by their favorite artists. Student photographers capture the moments along the way. It truly is a cool process when you just think about it. Yeh, we have faculty advisers but we really do get to make most of the important decisions for our organizations. It’s pretty neat and the product is one that is enjoyable for many students and faculty and staff on campus.

In neither style do you see players grabbing their character sheets as soon as they enter a new scene and shouting out “Anthropology! Archaeology! Botany! Cybe Culture!

Nearly everyone I am friends with in my life has always said that they hated me when they first met me. Apparently it’s because I am as about as approachable as a burning fireworks factory that is surrounded by landmines, velociraptors, and fundamental Christians. Which is, of course, not very approachable at all. But I totally get where they are coming from.

According to City Room, "The Central Park Precinct station house was originally built in 1871 near the site of the park reservoir keeper’s house. For the next few decades, it was used as a horse stable. It was converted into a police station in 1936. In 2001, the city built a temporary metal building near the station, and the precinct moved in so the building that was a stable could be renovated."

If Seventeen took the risk of showing actual girls in our magazine for girls, we risk coming off not as glamorous as our competitor fashion magazines. We are in the business of selling glamor for goodness sake. Again, the more unattainable that glamor is, the more likely girls are to feel insecure, the more likely they are to believe that they need to spend money on the products we’re selling. Get it now?
I quilted this one quite simply, following the seam lines about a quarter inch on each side. My walking foot decided to act up again. It's walking, but it might be drunk. Every time I crossed a seam the part of the foot that moves forward and back would get stuck back. The stitch length varies in certain sections where it was getting stuck before I realized what was going on. My fix? Every time I crossed over a seam, I would stop, tug that part forward, and keep going until it happened again a few inches later. It wasn't fun and my fingers were sore, but it led to a more satisfactory project than the alternative. I don't know why I have such lazy walking feet.... I love quilting like this (following the seam, not with an ornery foot) because the back of the quilt ends up looking just as nifty as the front.
The good folks over at Cooks Illustrated tried their hand at developing their take on the technique of no-knead bread. They made several interesting changes, including decreasing the water content, adding some beer and a tiny bit of vinegar to the liquids, and adding a tiny short kneading step during the loaf forming step after the initial long rise. This combination resulted in a rich, flavorful bread with a handsomely chewy crust. If anything, it is almost too assertive in having its own flavor; I might need to dial back on the salt on this loaf next time. This loaf has enough personality to run the show. It'd almost be wasted if used as a meal accompaniment and may well overwhelm dishes of milder character, but it works really well with a sweet spread or hearty sandwich filling (we tried egg and cheese and heirloom tomato, yum!). It's definitely worth a try if you're thinking of baking up a no-knead loaf. And certainly my husband was more than happy help me finish off the rest of the bottle of beer!
It's such guesswork...guessing what the demand for an item will be. I make my best guess, and hope for the best. My guess was a bit on the conservative side, when it came to what the response to the pattern "House of Blues & Browns Sampler" would be. In other words, I will not have yards and yards of brown ticking, and wondering what I'm going to do with it all! Nope, the dh will not be wearing any ticking shirts or undies!!

But obviously not disturbing enough, because I was a smoker for nine glorious years. I now get a sense of pride, when I see that the anti-smoking ads have re-surfaced, because I finally quit for the 12th (and final time). Please spare me the round of applause or pat on the back. I am a firm believer that quitters never win and winners never quit. Now that I stopped smoking I have to endure those golden years of life when you shit in your diaper & forget your name. Ya, ya smoking causes lung cancer, bad breath, wrinkley skin, etc. Pish-posh. Smoking has a major pro: rise in social capital.

I read day and night. The only time I stopped reading was after they turned the lights off and I couldn’t see anymore. This book, the Bible, was nothing like I expected. It was completely different than anything I had ever imagined. I was reading stories about things that I may have heard of, but had no idea what they were or what they meant. Now I was reading them for myself. The more I read the more I wanted to know. The farther I got, the farther I wanted to go.

Since we moved into our new dormitory last month, our trips to McDonald’s have reduced drastically – which isn’t a bad thing at all! I think I just heard my body breathe a sigh of relief. But yes, we pay visits from time to time, and try stuff like this spinach wrap with chicken. Delish, but warning for the braces tribe: not so good for the braces.
Anyway, my point is, that ever since this economy went to the crapper a couple of years ago, I've had to really get creative with having to cut back expenses and save money. At the same time, I didn't want our daily lives to radically change either. So, that's when the couponing came in. I also hit the department stores sales' racks, search consignment stores for awesome name brand clothes, and even joined a "resale event" for moms to bring in all outgrown clothing and toys, furniture, etc and sell it, and also buy stuff from all the other moms. It's almost like a high when I can find brand new Justice clothes for Miss Sassy for less than $5, or excellent condition Tommy or Polo shirts for Bubbalicious for just a few bucks. Craigslist has also been a really great place to find things we need for great prices. Just an example, to help with my new weight loss adventure, I found a brand new elliptical machine for sale on craigslist for only $50. Can't beat that with a stick! Now if I could just get my butt on it everyday, it might be effective. hehehe!
This anchor chart starts to deviate from the Sister's anchor chart. I noticed that, as I was beginning to write Teacher expectations on the right side, all of these charts would look exactly the same, so that seemed silly. I therefore started to branch out-- which the Sisters encourage!-- and added the orange "Choices" section. I find students referring to this a lot, so next year, I will probably change the entire right side to reflect the choices available to students during Read with Someone time.
Therefore, if someone asks you to go clubbing its strongly recommended that you 1. go with people you already know really well, as there will be no possibility of getting to know someone better due to the loudness of the music plus the darkness of the room will make it impossible for you to see a person face. 2. Keep personal items in a zipped up pouch tied across your stomach or chest to avoid being robbed. 3. Do not for any reason accept a drink or food from anyone, as it is likely you are not the first person to receive a gift of a drink or food from them as they are wanting to get in your pants and not develop actual meaningful friendship. 4. Keep sanitizer with you and frequently use it, as the amount of germs you will encounter will be the sum of if every toilet in the world was dumped into one giant pit and you were thrown in the middle of it and forced to swim your way out

These three efforts all failed spectacularly - tellingly none of them are even remotely part of any current discussion over their respective continuity points. There are two reasons for this. First, obviously, is that all of them are stupid. The idea that a group of eight middle aged men none of whom even look like each other were all younger versions of William Hartnell, who, as it happens none of them look like either is on the face of it ridiculous. Similarly, the sheer and massive weight of the implications raised by the claim that Gallifrey’s “present” is equivalent to 19th century Earth are in staggering excess of the ones raised by the Planet 14 comment in The Invasion.
And I had The Goat, The Sofa, and Mr. Swami for company on the rest of my journey. The unmistakable outline of the Indian Parliament building jumped out of the cover. A car lolled about in the street in front of the Parliament building, cleverly constructed out of letters making up the name of the author, R.

Why is your blog called Ocean Dreams? My blog is called Ocean Dreams because when I lived in Utah I dreamed of moving to Southern CA where I could go to school and have fun in the sun. To me the ocean has always been full of so many mysteries and through the years I’ve made so many memories there. After college I continued to live in Southern CA for 7 years and about a year ago I briefly moved back to UT. As of now, I spend my time in both CA and UT. I get the best of both worlds: my family and my ocean dreams. I always go to the ocean to pray, think, or find solace when life gets hectic and in the same way I wanted my blog to be a place of solace for myself and for my readers.

When I tell people what I do (mostly more creative, artistic friends) they give me a sympathetic frown. “Well, at least it’s a job,” they say. Or “You’re going to keep writing, right?” They’re shocked, like I sold out or that I work for “the man,” someone our English teachers warned us about. But I don’t feel the need to apologize or defend my choices. Do I have to starve to be an artist? Do I have to live in my parents basement until I’m 30 because I never have the money to move out? God knows freelancing doesn’t really pay the bills. You can sigh all you want – but I have a job and an apartment! And yes, I’m going to keep writing.

Christmas Day, we headed up to my parent's place from Dan's mom's house in Colorado Springs. We celebrated Christmas with the whole family and not even once did I struggle with sadness that I didn't have a kid, either with me or in my belly, that being the first time I could say that since my miscarriage in June '10. I was ecstatic.
In spite of all this, Dana allowed her son to visit his grandmother, even though he has already told his mother on several occasions to please ask her to stop barraging him with "bad questions" about her and his stepfather. About a month ago, CPS shows up at Dana's door with all kinds of accusation from the mother and now, her brother, Mr. Ph.D in social work!! After speaking with Dana and the kids and friends, she was convinced this was just a ploy to put a control Dana, so she closed the case. Again, won't go into any more details, too many and not so interesting, she gets served by her ex that he's going for custody of their son. She was beside herself and we all knew who was behind this web of lies and manipulation. I felt so badly for her, here was a good, hard-working woman who was betrayed by her own mother and now, brother. So tomorrow, we're off to Las Cruces, NM for the hearing, my honey and I will be testifying for Dana and she has an attorney who specializes in these matters that will be speaking for her 8 year old son. The poor little guy is experiencing all kinds of anxieties and fears that he will be taken from his family, so please pray for them or send good vibes out to the Universe. Peace out.

Making it to the semi-finals and beating Real, who had recently beaten Barcelona, are among Bayern’s achievements in the past month. Bayern has placed themselves in a terrific position to win the Tournament and claim the title of top team in the world. Chelsea will also suffer from the loss of their Center Back and Captain, John Terry, due to a red card received in the 35th minute of the game. Missing the guidance and scoring ability of veteran striker Didier Drogba may also hurt them. Because of these facts and missing key and influential players, I believe that Bayern Munich led by Veterans Frank Ribery, Mario Gomez and Arjen Robben, will win the Champions League against Chelsea.

We were at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park, in Berkeley when it all went bad. The park is kind of like a prison yard, especially during the Farmer’s Market: little pockets of the homeless in one section, families in another; skaters, folks who believe that Burning Man should never end, and people attempting to get you to sign something all dot the landscape. Tucked away, next to a fountain that has seen more piss than water, is a raggedy little park-ish play area that my daughter adores.

Maria was twelve now and had been keeping watch like this on the beach next to her home since she was five. She grew with a knowledge and respect for the sea instilled in all children on the island. They knew its power and marveled at its beauty. It was a playground to them on the hot clear days and a monster when the sky turned dark and grey, but none of the other children shared the same kind of fascination for it as Maria did. She shared a special connection with the sea, a secret kept between the two of them. On a night such as this, many years ago when Maria was a little girl she saw something she would never forget and would always search for from that day forth whenever the skies were clear and the moon was full and the waves were strong. It was when she was only five years old that Maria saw it.

The chiropractor told me that movement and exercise is Spooks' best friend. The better condition he has, the more limber he will be. That was kind of a no-brainer, but in Spooks' case, its even more apparent. Obviously it was going to take more adjustments, coupled with a good conditioning program to get Spooks' aligned again. I sort of expected that I would have to lay off competition for a bit, but the chiro told me that competing would be fine. It would be important to have him well warmed up and to keep him moving so he did not re-stiffen.

She turned around to get shots of the trail she’d just climbed and saw a glint of metal reflecting the sun. She squinted. What was that? A television? She found herself smiling—her first smile since Alexander died. She scrambled back down the trail. The television had been dumped a long time ago judging by the creosote bushes that had grown up around it, but footprints leading to the box suggested it had been visited recently. She took several shots from the trail, about fifteen yards from the television, then moved closer. The television had no screen, and she could see that something had been stuffed inside. A doll? She crept closer. Ten feet away, she stopped to take another photo, and the truth washed over her. Not a doll. Crammed inside the console was a child, a girl, her eyes half-eaten by some desert predator.

A wise man once said you get paid what you can negotiate. Not what's "fair". Not what's "right". So given that our logic then devolves into a Beat chest/dig-heels-in/get angry mentality, and we go down a road with no negotiated end. We have stasis. But I digress. Assuming we WERE adept negotiators, why couldn't we get a Southwest contract? Answer, same reason Delta couldn't. Same reason American didn't. We have a different debt structure to Southwest, and as debt service is approximately one third of an airline's overhead, (labor and fuel making up the majority of the rest) a disparity in this number is a huge factor in overall financial health. (Anybody paying attention this week will note the corporate bond market is heading south along with the DOW and NasDaQ, and so our counterparts in management are being faced with a progressively more difficult economic future.)

So what is the “third heaven”? It is the abode of God, and what the apostle observed was “unlawful for man to utter.” Such is beyond human understanding for there probably are no words in the human vocabulary to describe such a place.

Interested in using social media in your job search but not sure how? Here is a quick breakdown of some of the most popular social media sites and apps. Social media is so important when it comes to employment. Employers are now on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, just like many others. So why not utilize all the tools possible? Not using social media is like cutting a steak with a spoon, when you have a knife. Please, feel free to ask questions if needed.

We live in a time where we can get almost any kind of produce we want, anytime of the year. This isn’t necessarily a good thing, as much of this produce is shipped overseas and it is days or even weeks (scary!) before it arrives at our markets. This sacrifices taste, freshness, nutrition and price. By eating seasonally and locally (within your country) you will not have to forgo any of these things. Each season available produce will change. In summer, you will be able to eat fruits and vegis grown in your state or even in your backyard. In winter, as options become a bit more limited, rely more on grains and beans and frozen produce from the warmer months.
So, where did it all go horribly wrong for me this year? Well, for starters, I planted my sets in spring and then the weather was unseasonably hot. I've now read that some varieties just will not grow in hot areas or will only set one clove or no bulb at all. The other (big) mistake I made was to make the cardinal error of growing my garlic in the same bed as the year before - although I improved the soil with a top dressing of compost, the sets were still at the mercy of any diseases left in the soil from the previous year; this, apparently, can be another cause for no bulb. None of this, though, explains how the leaves grew looking like leek leaves - although the bulb also looks like a giant spring onion or green garlic. Hmmm, it will have to remain as one of nature's mysteries.

This is the riveting first-person narrative of Kvothe, a young man who grows to be one of the most notorious magicians his world has ever seen. From his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, The Name of the Wind is a masterpiece that transports readers into the body and mind of a wizard.

But to really make a killing, you need not just revenues, but profits. That’s why the low cost delivery and “build it once but resell it millions of times” model is so key. It was that very model that made Bill Gates the richest man in the world. It is what earned Microsoft 13 TIMES the rate of profit of the average Fortune 500 company in the 1990s and persuaded the Justice Department to declare it a “felony monopolist”. Gates recognizes the model very well, which is why his foundation is pouring tens of millions of dollars into charters. And you thought it was his altruism.

In another plea for us to go away, the selling agent told us that even if the appraisal comes in at our offer price of $320,000, they are unable to accept an offer of less than $340,000. That's a huge red flag that we are right on with our above assumptions. . .and when that day comes (and it will), Dave and I will march into their lending bank and show them proof of the square footage discrepancy and our attempts to purchase their home, thus preventing the owners from needing to enter a short-sale situation. The bank, seeing the problem with their mortgage and not wanting to enforce or pay for a foreclosure, would also be on our side.

One thing that was great about my ride was my new bike seat cover. River mentioned in the comments of my last post that she was getting chafing from her seat and needed a new one. I couldn't recommend it more! Mine is called a comfort seat and all bike shops have them. I have taken just the seat and pole to the shop before so they can put a new seat on for me. It saves taking the whole bike and is easy to get off using the quick release lever that most bikes have. Even though I was still slightly tender after riding, the actual ride was softer and more comfortable than ever. The gel seat cover wasn't cheap at $40 but my lovely lady parts think it was worth every cent!

Having all of that space just to simply over winter at the garden share would be a real waste. We've been up there a few days this week to clear all of the raised beds, and cover the two side beds for over the winter. The middle bed has been dug over and is ready for the cabbage and leek plants as well as some late salad.
I'm keeping careful track of what food I eat. After several years of fiddling about, I've finally become serious about entirely cutting out sugar and grains (insulin and blood sugar problems galore all my adult life, but did I think I needed to do something right now? Noooo!) and starting an exercise regimen designed to ward off osteoporosis, the dreaded side effect of surgical menopause.
P.S. Thanks again to The Newsmarket for supplying such amazing footage!
But it’s really not my place to judge, is it? Maybe it didn’t even occur to him that some of us might be bothered. Maybe he was so excited about what he can achieve creatively, that he couldn’t wait to share it with the world. He probably loves the idea of flying too. And so maybe I should try to lighten up. Maybe I should enjoy the fact that for a while I was really happy to see my childhood dream come true.

I'm about ready to throw in the towel and declare our home a completely sweetener-free zone, focusing only on fruits to satisfy our family's sweet teeth. BUT, that doesn't work when you have kids that are old enough to remember the allure of the frozen yogurt, jelly beans, candy bars, and Halloween candy they ate just weeks ago.
Presently I felt I'd had a good amount of exercise and should probably go in. I monitored the waves. I rode the swell. I held back from the breakers. I was carried into the shore, perfectly vertical, ahead of a wave. I landed, en pointe, daintily in front of the crowd. Just as I was at my MOST cocky, a wave I'd ignored because, after all, I was walking up the shelf on dry land, knocked me flying.

Now what bothered me was that the person sending out the cards did not put his or her name on them, which I felt was more than a little cowardly. However, I am not surprised, I have had my own unhappy encounters with a particular neighbor who likes to hide behind anonymity or call the deputy sheriff on me over areas I would have happily rectified or explained if he had the cojones to come talk with me in person.

The second time I made this I used full chicken breasts rather than halves, and they took much longer to cook, so it’s helpful to have a meat thermometer nearby (as I almost always do when I’m nervously cooking chicken). Cook time aside, everything turned out perfectly! I made this for my brother-in-law, who is a somewhat picky eater and – shockingly – claimed to have never tried chicken parmigiana before. He ate the whole thing, so he must not have hated it too bad!

Being a frugal, tightwad son-of-a-gun, I declined to take that good advice, opting instead to delete the remaining spices from the mix, and sticking solely with the orange zest, honey and "loads o' cinnamon" brewing model. I let the stuff percolate in the Mr. Beer keg for a couple weeks, maybe three, but was not encouraged when the yeast immediately dropped to the bottom of the keg in about the first 24 hours.

Ranka didn’t have anything as inspiring or cheesy, but she’d never have these combat skills either (she won’t need to because she’d have either the SMS/NUNS behind her, or LOL the Vajra swarms); she didn’t even have to fight along with her band (Lovely Bomber) – she just needed to get them space lolicons serving their prison time all hot-blooded. So, if I inserted Ranka in this episode, would she have stolen the show? She’s prettier than everyone so there’s that, but unless she sings Aimo out of context or something, that’s not quite going to happen.
We all start out ‘ordinary’ and to me that’s OK. Ordinary is just fine if ordinary means original, unaltered, as God intended. Ordinary in this sense is unique and FULL of potential.

As is usual amongst BYU fans, the excuses started immediately with the worst excuse being "the refs gave the Utes that game with a bad fumble call." Excuse me BYU babies, the refs also called a pass from Heaps to one of his receivers on 3rd and long a complete pass while the receiver was clearly bobbling the ball all the way out of bounds and never had control until he was completely out. That drive then led to a touchdown. So stop making excuses and buck up like Jake Heaps, your QB, who said "Utah played a great game and made the plays when they needed to make the plays." He earned our respect this weekend. Quit crying. No one call cost you the game, because as we recall, BYU marched right down the field and made an admittedly great strategic move by letting the clock run down to 4 seconds which meant that Utah couldn't get another play off, even a kick return. BYU was down 17-16 and had a field goal attempt right down the middle of the field. That would be the last play of the game and it was BLOCKED!!! That caused BYU to lose the game. Nothing more, nothing less. That is a fact.

The movie veers into “gross out” territory a couple times, and though it doesn’t entirely miss the mark with those scenes, they felt a little unnecessary. I thought the movie could have survived just fine without at least one of them (the shaving scene), but I’m probably pretty alone in that opinion.
A Dram Shop Notice is a special letter that tells the establishment or person who served the alcohol that a claim for damages is being made against the establishment, a description of the time, place, and circumstances giving rise to the claim, and the name and mailing address for the person making the claim. If the drunk driving led to not just an injury, but death, then you have a year instead of 180 days. Basically, a Dram Shop Notice will hold a bar owner responsible for not training employees according to the OLCC’s guidelines regarding intoxicated drinkers.

Associated with transience, remember, is a sense of time passing. That is why in hokku, things that are old or worn or weathered or broken are valued; they show the passage of time. The transience of hokku is also why every hokku is set within a particular season, whether it is mentioned in the verse or used as its classification. The seasons come and the seasons go, and what happens within the seasons is constantly changing.
For those who are wondering why I am still wearing a summer clothes in December, it is because my family and I live in a city that lies on a tropical island. Jakarta, Indonesia.

We are going to have plenty of gifts to buy together for our future real soon.

I am grateful for my job and for being at this school in particular. I feel supported by my staff, inspired by the students, included, valued, and honored by the school community.

Second, we realized the plan to spray paint the old light fixtures and reuse them wasn’t going to work, so we had to spend additional money on new fixtures AND I had to install them without killing myself. Considering that I had a difficult time flipping a light switch without getting a shock, my likelihood of success was rather low. Ultimately this ended up being the easiest part of the entire job, but the dent it put in the budget negates any personal triumph I may have felt about accomplishing this.
Panic ensues, shovels fly, Cathy remembered a bag of sand in the garage, and I managed to get it up the street into a clear driveway I'd seen when I was out taking pictures at sunrise.

For a long time, I hated this need, and tried to subvert it, going out with vanilla boys who were perfectly sweet, and sweetly perfect, and therein lay the problem. They were too sweet, too soft, and treated me too tenderly, or ones who somehow fetishized my size, turning me into a woman to put on a pedestal and cower under rather than a living, breathing woman. If it weren’t men building me up to an inflated size and importance like in Rene Magritte’s painting The Giantess, they were considering me a cuddly teddy bear of a girl, someone whose cleavage they could nuzzle up to, someone they could stroke and fondle, someone who could mommy them in a sexual way, but never slap and sting. That would offend their principles. I say, fuck principles, fuck propriety. What’s a hot-blooded kinky girl to do with her desire to bend over?
My personal favourite. This is totally my little baby! Worn at every possible opportunity, I think (hope!) it has become something of an icon. Easily customized (my favourite thing to do) with a few badges (or 15 badges...) or brooches to make it your own.

Someone--my mother, my grandfather, my grandmother, or maybe one of my aunts--told me the story when I was young.

I have enjoyed writing an epistle, or should I say I am enjoying, there is another section I’d like to write on a slightly different subject that I think will interlink with what is copied out below. And so the conlusion to what you are about to read will be included in that. I’ve enjoyed it not least because its tone has caused me to be a lot more specific about my position on things (in this case miracles and signs). The strangest part of writing an open letter such as this is the matter of audience. Who was I writing it too? Its evident that in the letter that its to those in a generally charismatic, spirit lead mould; however you’d like to put it. But obviously it doesn’t apply to everyone. I feel a resistant to getting too specific about audience – precisely because I’ve taken on a tone of authority when I know that when it comes down to it the is very much a plank sticking out of my eye. Also there is the fact that the epistle is not yet complete and in its current state it might leave its recipient deflated. Also I’m not sure that the forum even exists for this to be a real read-out letter and not just a study exercise.
