DUH!!! Isn't Jamaica Bay supposed to be a WILDLIFE REFUGE???? After they get rid of the gulls, what species will be the next culprit? After all, those jet engines "suck in everything". The cormorants maybe? They are awfully big birds and there seem to be a lot of them around. And talking about big birds, how about getting rid of the Egrets & Herons? We all know the golden rule of ecosystems: If one species is removed, another species will take over. So if the gulls & the geese are gone, there will be more resources available for whatever species moves in to occupy their niche. And that species may be even more problematic.

If you have never used sugar scrub before, get ready for some super soft smooth feeling skin. I love every one I have ever made, and my sensitive skin usually gets dried out no matter what product I use. Just take a small scoop and add a few drops of water, then rub between your hands before applying to your face so it spreads evenly.

For many years when people heard of my different roles like foster/adopt mom, advocate, volunteer, etc. I would be given a lot of great feedback. It’s nice to hear complimentary things. Do you ever hear mean things in your head? Does someone say you look pretty and then you hear in your head, except that extra 15 pounds I’ve gained; or someone says, you have such a lovely family, and suddenly you think, They should have seen that fight my husband and I had last night; what do these people know?! When someone says, Wow, it’s great that you give these children such a great home! Suddenly from out of nowhere I hear something not audible to anyone else, Yeah, they think you’re so nice. Did you tell them you are a murderer!?
Things got really serious when Jae Ha started mocking Hang Ah thinking of last nights event. That maybe she desired him and that she’s indeed in dire need of a man. Nappeun namja!! To make things worse, Jae Ha grabbed her hand and told her point blank that he doesn’t feeling a thing since he’s no woman to him. Bulls eye. Hang Ah’s tears just fell as words pierced her badly.

The game is a first-person shooter, and one that helped define the genre. You play as William "B.J." Blazkowicz as you make a great escape from Castle Wolfenstein. You have to fight your way through hoards of Nazis as you find your way through ten levels. Navigating through the levels can be troublesome because it's easy to get lost. Plus, you need to find keys to unlock certain doors. There are also hidden passages to find that contain treasures, ammo, and/or health. There's even a boss fight at the end, and I was terrified of this guy. To be fair though, he is quite terrifying with his two mini-guns.

I'm not sure when a Japanese funeral ends. The last time I went to what I now believe to be a prayer ceremony/wake, people just left when they felt like. This time, the son was speaking, when people just started to dissipate. When the lady I was with got up to leave, so did I.
I never thought of it that way, but it makes a lot of sense. I’ve said before that I don’t generally read category romance (Harlequin books) mostly because they’re shorter. I have read some and just because they’re shorter doesn’t mean they’re easier to write. In my opinion, they’re harder to write (but maybe I’m just long-winded).

Of course, if that is what he is arguing, it doesn’t make much sense for him to focus on the prayer issue. If he was dismissed on those grounds, then that may be indirect discrimination, but it would not be a whistleblowing case.
Oh, wow. Sallymandy of The Blue Kimono passed the Kreativ Blogger award on to me. I wish I could say that I was all nonchalant about it. But when I realized that by "Stephanie at Circle of Clothes," she was referring to me (it took a few seconds to process), I bounced up and down in my chair a little, and made an immature sound that goes something like "Eeeeeee!" And then I panicked for a few seconds, because I was all like, "wait, this means I actually have to do something."
Did anyone see where this year went? And in particular this December? I wish the first 24 days of December went by so quickly as a child! It is the last night of the year and I can honestly say this has been one of the most frenetic and topsy turvy years of my life. Christmas was wonderful but difficult too with various family issues, some old and some new. In the main though, both of the children and also myself were thoroughly spoiled. We ate so much and I put on more weight that I knew was physically possible in one week and we just spent time as a family which was wonderful. Management had to work a few days and is working tomorrow as he doesn't drink so he always does the New Year's Day shift. We'll be heading over to have lunch with him and get some much needed fresh air, even if it is raining! I swear I could be abducted by aliens, dropped back to earth and have absolutely no idea which time of the year it is - it seems to have been mild and wet for the entire year.
Out Of 3-Dimension is a slow, somewhat ponderous piece with some lighter, dancing elements. This comes quite close to the old Camel. Plenty of melody and although quite mellow, the opening is quite atmospheric. The guitar playing reminds of Greece.

Check it out. I have visitors from 107 countries. I didn't even know there WERE 107 countries! No one from Greenland has checked it out though. There's gotta be a scientist or two living in that frozen land, don't you think? I think they'd like to read about the goofy things my kids do. But I'm not going to get obsessed about it like Que!

This certainly doesn’t have the feel of a full-blown tirade against the West and it is too early to say whether this might develop into more anti-US statements from Atta and the Northern Alliance or become a wider demonstration from elements of the population. I’m guessing not, but presenting yourself as protecting Afghan sovereignty is in easy win at present – Karzai has spent the last year (and more?) poking the West in this fashion. It is not impossible that Atta is starting to build up his profile, perhaps as part of a presidential campaign bid– particularly given Karzai has been dropping hints of calling the election early – ie in 2013.

That was good preparation for the agent search, but before that commenced, I let the MS sit for 5 weeks or so, then revised the whole thing. It was ready (or so I thought), and in October 2009, I sent out my very first query – the agent at the top of my list who represented one of my favorite writers, Louis de Bernières. I was aiming high, and full of all the delusions of a new writer, and yet to become cynical, jaded, and doubting.

Even though he didn't ask I also told him my understanding of what Holly witnessed. He seemed a little surprised when I mentioned the near miss. This is what's is bothering me the more I think about it. Is the fact that she nearly hit my kids not in the police report?! Now I want to see a copy of it but my friends on FB tell me I may not be able to get until after the trial, if it goes that far. I'm thinking I should call the Prosecutor's office just to be sure they are aware of the near miss and not just the property damage. Do you know what kind of information I need for them to find the case I'm talking about? I don't know the lady's last name, I do know the date of the incident though.
Perhaps the largest delight of the show, however, is being able to take time with a large number of drawings and a few sculptures by Duncan Anderson. I hope to write a longer piece on Anderson’s work, but at the moment, I just want to highly recommend it. The drawings take us through a landscape of emotional states, transporting us not only through popular culture but also down the corridors of history. It is difficult to describe the poetry that plays out in these works. Sometimes, the work is simple and exuberant, a text graphic of the tobacco label “Skoal” with “fuck yeah” next to it. Other times, the work is dazzling and touching. There is always, however, a sense of forbidding comedy to the work. My favorite is a drawing that is just gold glitter and a few lightly traced lines. This is Swarm Reenacting in Homage and Fear the Creation of the Universe, a title loaded with so much at once, a sweeping metaphor of our place in the universe while an expression of childlike wonderment. Yet “fear” lingers over the proceeding. You don’t know why the intimation of “fear” has power, but it changes everything and fits perfectly. Take a close look at Anderson’s despondent Darth Vader, without his helmet and defeated. The title says it all, Lord Vader and His World Falling Apart.
Every man, woman, and child farts. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. But, still, it's gross, unladylike, and just plain eeww. I will always maintain my position on it, being the worst thing possible that I don't do.
My former housemate Elísabet – who is something of a sensation in her country, and only dates men half her age – writes very beautifully about sex because she is not afraid of what people will think. She says an orgasm is like a hand that reaches up inside her, grasps her by the spine, and shakes her like a rattle, an inch away from the death of one self and the rebirth of another. I have no capacity to write beautifully about sex. Often I am battling through the swamp of a dozen pints, the smoke of twenty cigarettes, and no sleep for days. The exercise is nauseating, and I feel like the young Orwell working in a small, hot, Paris kitchen.

Without the pictures, it's still a clever, twisting story, much in the vein of "Holes." The writing is solid and filled with bits of humor, even when things take a darker turn.

This is the clever part. If newco were allowed to play at Perth, and in doing so, as it is the same Rangers, in terms of players, staff, strip and fans, then newco would be slipping directly into oldco’s shoes and effectively claiming to own all of the assets, including the points accumulated throughout the season to date. This would be an attempt to blow a hole in the various regulations, rules and legalities which might be seen as blocking the way.

I've been told I'm too picky....but this is my life, don't I get to be a little picky? At one point I convinced myself to just send an email to everyone I've been matched to, but felt this really scary, tight feeling in my chest when I started to do it. In real life, not on eHarmony, I'm not so into looks, money or status, in fact I usually fall for the guy with the best sense of humor, who is happy to be fishing every day for the rest of his life (not that there is anything wrong with that) and who likes his dog better than most of his family.....but clearly that hasn't worked for me either, as I am alone.

Late December of 2011, the Los Angeles City Attorney filed suit against AHF arguing that putting the proposed initiative on the ballot would be too costly for the City–$4.4 million.

Then at U.S. Nationals we finally had some fireworks, as Shalonda Solomon blitzed the year’s fastest legal time with her 22.15 win. The real surprise, however, was the second place finish of Carmelita Jeter as her semi (22.24) and final (22.23) made her a serious contender heading into Daegu. A 22.20 win in Monaco during the summer (over Felix among others) solidified her credentials. And with VCB competing only once more before Daegu (off the grid in Budapest) and Felix not looking sharp, the year’s preseason favorites looked like they could give way to an upstart at Worlds.

The best show on Australian TV would have to be Four Corners. Often over looked because, well, it’s been on the air since the sixties, it’s an intelligent current affairs program on the ABC, and it’s Four Corners for crying out loud, it continues to deliver thought provoking journalism. While scripted Australian drama may not have offered anything worth writing home about this year, from week to week Four Corners delivered stories that were shocking, heartbreaking and easily some of the most captivating television of the year.

My father read this to my younger brother and I when we were kids. I loved the book, I loved the movies and it's a massive book which means it will keep me occupied for a while. There's nothing like a bit of Mordor to distract from the fact you're stranded, right?
I’ve managed to find a few more of Heaney’s poems from that time. I don’t have any books by him but he appears in a few anthologies. ‘Blackberry Picking’ is a very similar piece and, as I mentioned above, this is something we did annually. I can even remember my whole family going out blackberry picking though I think most of the berries that survived the trip home ended up being eaten with sugar – just imagine how bad that was for us – because I can’t see my mum making jam; perhaps once. ‘Blackberry Picking’ is also a poem about transformation, the key lines being:

looking towards their jobs rather than that of the people. Certainly the plight of the working class has not been addressed if anything they have been purposely marginalised, robbed of the ability to garner a decent wage and scorned by the elites of this country, as a rule the working class have been belittled, disparaged and demeaned, to such an extent that many now have no self-respect and that bastion of our nations strength exemplified by the worker and his estate, the worker the very backbone of this country, his living space now merely a battleground, a conflict zone, no longer a community, now merely a place in which one must survive.

As an experienced Hollywood insider, Maas was assigned by her studio to greet the young actress at the train station. She did so, but found the young actress rather uncouth. LeSueur, seeing Maas as a person of experience and sophistication, nevertheless asked the well-dressed scriptwriter to help build her wardrobe and shape a more glamorous image. Maas agreed, but found the experience challenging. She thought Crawford a “tramp.” The assembled crowd howled with laughter.
Take, for example, the popular view of the First World War.

Right NOW, today, we are enjoying our day off this week. The kids have practice every day but today and Friday, but that's skate day and we have plans for the entire day out. It's been raining, but the new patches seem to be working, no leaking! The Volvo is waiting for Matt to come home and check it out this evening, I think it's drivable until we get the part in. We are all healthy and the house is clean, laundry all done, porch swept, pets fed.
I don’t think my data set is complete enough to answer that accurately. In my experience it’s more than you’d think, but it does depend on the nature of the artist. Bands that are very competent and produce really good quality records but that don’t have some extra hook – great lyrics, a good backstory, a man in a blue suit covered in gloves – tend to do less well. People don’t feel as involved in supporting a release by their tenth favourite band. I think it’s a system that rewards people who are 1,000 people’s favourite act in the world rather than acts that 10,000 people quite like. I’m happy with this as I prefer the former category anyway.

Sadly, Lara's family can not afford to pay for her cremation. The hospital will cremate her for free, but will not return the ashes to the family. We are hoping to collect enough contributions from our friends and family to cover the cost of cremation so that Lara can go home with her family. The cost is approximately $1500. If you'd like to contribute, and I hope you will, you can paypal a donation to Timara Trenkamp Bolding at timara.bolding@adelphia.net or mail or drop off a check to either of us. If we receive more in donations than the cost of the cremation, we'll put the remaining funds into a savings bond for her two young children.

Now here's the odd thing. There was a stronger Younger's Bitter called IPA (you can see it in the table below). But, back in the 19th century, Younger had two Pale Ales: XP and XXP. According to a price list, the weaker XP was marketed as IPA, XXP as Export Pale Ale. So which should be stronger - Pale Ale or IPA? Answers should be sent directly to the BJCP.

And more importantly, they don't tell you how awesome you are.

The Mecha Robots, a different one everyday, was shown every afternoon in GMA-7 right after coming home from grade school’s afternoon session (the “pang-hapon”); just before the top-rated soap opera “Ana Lisa” (with its Roberta Flack theme “If Ever I See You Again“).
The "blocks" section includes 150 blocks divided into different sections: basic stitches, textured motifs, cables, ribbing, lace, stripes & colour, intarsia, fair isle, ripples, embroidery, beading and patterns for squares in the letters of the alphabet and the numbers 1-10. A few of the variations are quite similar (e.g. several of the "stripes and colour" blocks are just variations of the same stitch in different stripey colour combinations), but there's still a huge amount of information crammed into this section.
So is is another good month and we are definitely on the path back, plus good news in Europe as the Greek mess looks at least reasonably contained leaves me reasonably optimistic.
The barely audible thud and beep, beep, beep as the alarm was reset calmed Brodie's taut nerves as he leaned against the door to catch his breath. Laughing at his own paranoia, he stared at the 10 inch monitor that served as a window and watched the perimeter camera perform a sweep of the front porch, then continue on its panoramic journey to reveal the emptiness between the house and the forest.
I started with the purple heart, not because of Valentine's Day, but because of it's representation of the purple heart for bravery. To make the heart, I used a long piece of copper wire, strung it with random beads in purple tones and then bent it into the shape of a heart. From there, I just works one area at a time, letting the piece tell me where to go next, until it was done.
Whew! Well, soon it will be back to non-Christmas stuff and from what I've seen from scrolling through older challenges at these sites, I'll have a much harder time combining challenges. But this has been fun while it lasts! I'll just have to make lots more cards in 2012! =)

Our first place, where we lived for three years, overlooked a giant construction site where they basically took out half a mountain to build a big shopping complex. There were huge klieg lights on at all hours, so in winter at night we had orange artifical light streaming in the windows constantly (never remember seeing the moon) and the dynamiting of the rock was so loud that I had to push glassware back onto the shelves or it would start to vibrate off.
aaaand after: i painted the cabinets and backsplash (yes, i just painted directly over the stone!) white, and added some modern handles from IKEA. i also added pale grey baskets above the cabinets for storage, and hung an old wooden frame above the sink. i attached a sleek lampshade to the previous fixture for a more modern look, as well.

Shutting the Port of Oakland by the rank and file of Oakland’s working class is an opening blow using class struggle methods of direct militant action against the greatest imperialist power. To be victorious it needs to be followed up with armies of militants armed with a class program and clear understanding that only a workers’ government based on workers democracy can resolve this crisis in the favor of the working classes and oppressed people here and across the world. This task requires the building of local, national and international revolutionary leadership cadre united in a revolutionary workers international organization committed to the method of the 1938 program of the Fourth International.
I see the CSS as a minor faction with aspirations of growth; the advice on p. 126 of Stars Without Number tells me that the faction should have 4 in its primary attribute (probably Cunning – it’s a survey and espionage outfit), 3 in its secondary (Wealth, because it can afford to hand out constructive possession of scoutships) and 1 in its tertiary (only Force is left), which gives it 15 hit points. The CSS also has one asset in its primary attribute, and another in some other attribute; browsing through the lists on pp. 118-123, I select Covert Shipping/Cunning 3 (which includes Arion and the Dolphin), and Surveyors/Wealth 2 (which seems to reflect their official purpose as a Traveller-style scout service).

Following just behind Shannon are two of the New World Power members, each one of them armed. The third member of this trio stayed with the van so that he could follow her in the vehicle. And in his attempt to plan ahead, he actually got ahead of Shannon in an attempt to cut her off. This is due in part to relatively light traffic on the street and his thought that Shannon would continue to run down the alley, not through the buildings.
I came home and I told my husband this experience and turns out he too has been in prayer about checking out recovery for his own reasons. There are no coincidences with God and I feel like He is telling us that we need to be there. This has been a big week spiritually, I have seen so many answered prayers that I probably cried 3 times with joy. With my own fear layed out on the table, I go to bed tonight in prayer that I listen to what God is telling me and do what He will have me do and that I do NOT ignore His revelation to me.

The beginning of the book includes the basics of right angle weave with colored illustrations and arrows to show where to weave your needle and thread (or stringing material. These illustrations came in very handy when I got confused with the project directions. The illustrations are followed by "Tips and Tricks for Right Angle Weave by David Chatt." It's a list of tips for the more experienced right angle beadweaver. Page 8 is "Beading Technique Basics" and it covers topics like adding thread, ending thread surgeion's knot, other beadweaving stitches, wire techniques and opening jump rings to name just a few. Tools and materials are covered in the next section. I'm very familiar with these materials so I skipped over this section and went straight to the first pattern by Pam O'Connor, "The Cuff Crystallized."

Don't get me wrong, for these farms are very different from the olden days where, heaven forbid, a real, actual farmer would own and live on the premises. Here, the farms have been bought out by large companies that have converted the buildings into desirable barn conversions that local people can't afford and, for the crops, send in a locum farmer a couple of times a week to make sure things are still alive. For this reason, any old farm buildings can become quite neglected and a haven for pesty critters.

In my pre-Easter holiday planning, knitting was at the top of my list. I had my yarn selected and purchased, my pattern reviewed, needles selected and packed. And fabulously, I had another pair of hands to wrangle the children, and even drive. I knitted in the car, at the beach, over coffee, after dinner. In a few days I put enough rows under my belt to secure my conviction - this garment would not be abandoned.

Life is a choice. What we claim to believe must affect the way we watch after our families, our children, our humans in the boat. As for me and my family, what we claim to believe will not be collapsed by rulers or authorities, and yet we can’t stand to let the battle remain in our minds.
Chef Marcel explained that he wanted to bring the egg back to the nest at the end of the meal, and that's where the concept came from.

First, I’ll give you a recap. My 2011 goal was to run a 5K every month. That proved a little harder that I originally thought not because of the distance, but because of the distance I would need to travel in order to find a 5K every month. What started as an attainable goal ended up as way more than I dreamed I could ever do. I was not athletic as a child, a young adult or as an adult thus far. I knew trying to do this was a big stretch, but I made it my new passion.
All the Just Rite circle stamps are so fun to use them with all the different circle punches, nestibiliites or circle cutting systems and there are so many fun possibilities on how to layer them on your card or project. The project that I made today is a fun (and inexpensive (under $5)) gift for my children's preschool teacher. I created a little winter pail filled with socks and a matching card. I got this pail at Target for $1 and some socks to fill in the pail.
I’ve been out in some gales before, and this one is a good one! There were several times when the wind was strong enough to make walking difficult. Needless to say, I didn’t take many photos. Most of the wildlife was either laying low or being blown around so much by the wind that photography was close to impossible. When I did try shooting something, the wind make it hard for me to hold still. I did manage a few though.

Once a month I teach a bunch of children in the Icelandic congregation here in London. We play with puppets and sing a whole lot of songs. I like the songs, but these are the same songs I was singing when I went to Sunday school myself. I feel they're out of sync with the pop culture that kids grow up with today; the songs they're singing are older than their teacher. So I decided to apply for a grant at Christian funding foundation in Iceland called Kristnihátíðarsjóður, and thus focus on spending time writing songs. The idea was to write songs especially for the Sunday school. The songs I wrote are a little more pop and modern. When I was driving last year with my little niece from Reykjavik to Akureyri, I found out that the monkey song was her favorite and it was played 30 times on the way. My goal was to make a beautiful children's album that both children and adults could enjoy, with both a healthy message for kids but equally fun to enjoy musically. It's a fun project to work on because it's so totally different from what I'm usually doing. Instead of focusing on myself I love just working with music in general, recording and also writing music for others.
Ms Rush, her nonprofit employer Knowbility, and others in the disability, academic, and technology community launched an effort today to persuade the University to maintain and build on this important body of work.

In the last two installments, I failed to mention the important role played by the musical score. Indeed, John Williams created one of the most distinct and recognizable scores ever for this series. And with swelling strings, booming drums and stirring horns, makes the viewer realize how much more attached the emotions become when the music behind the scene is so stirring. Especially effective is the theme played between Vader and Luke, IMHO.

The truth is, we Americans love to talk. There are television and radio talk shows galore. Everybody seems to have something to say. The average American has 30 conversations a day and spends 1/5 of his life talking. In one year your conversations will fill 66 books of 800 pages a book. If you’re a man you speak an average of 20,000 words a day. If you’re a woman you speak 30,000 words a day. It’s like the guy who was asked, “Do you resent the fact that your wife always has to get the last word?” He replied, “No, I’m just glad when she finally gets to it!”

I do not stress this point out of any great devotion to an alma mater. Like Shakespeare, perhaps like Stevens, I’m a non-Oxfordian. I only wonder at what point the rules that apply to each one of us finally apply to the same chattering class which happily tosses these rules down on us. For if I were asked why Stevens thinks he can state that he went to Oxford when he did not, which, if it were the case, is a lie, and why he thinks he can write a memoir like Malaria Dreams with a timeline so scrambled that, outside other possible explanations, suggests a series of lies, I believe the answer is that he has enough contacts within this chattering class that any deep scrutiny can be avoided. While those of us outside this chattering class will have our smallest shortcomings punished with financial austerity, Stevens is given grace, because he knows people we do not.

At the time of making these offers and soliciting these services, JPSA urged that the accused be charged with the appropriate crimes of driving under the influence of alcohol, reckless or negligent driving and five counts of culpable homicide, but that plea was overridden by the Minister of Transport calling for charges of murder to be brought and the NPA obliged.
This room would have been the social centre of the house, heated by a hearth in the middle of the floor that was the symbol of commensality and hospitality as well as the literal source of heat and light. For several centuries the hall was loud with conversation and, probably, music, and alive with the comings and goings of servants. But the bustle is long gone. The house has not been lived in for some 200 years, although it was kept in good repair by benevolent Victorian owners who lived in a more modern house not far away. They ensured the survival of this spacious hall, lit by its two rows of tall Gothic windows, its roof is supported by great cruck timbers tied together by pairs of horizontal collars and curving braces. This structure creates a beautiful space and even in its emptiness, the hall at Stokesay is one of the most evocative rooms in England.

I was in a quandary about what to cook one evening. I had some sausages in the refrigerator and not much else. What could I make?

Two students at each presentation played the role of presidential candidates and offered their ideas about the issues they would address to the American people. And two more students presented amazing performances as the President of the United States. I wonder if there was a future mayor, senator, governor or even president in the audience that day…
All the protective instincts of a father had to be present in God, just as it was in Ron Lemming, Sr. But, God held back, knowing what it would take to save mankind. That was fortunate for us. But the son trusted the father’s wisdom, and with good cause. Three days later the father said, “Rise up, Son.”
Initially, they wanted to do a biopic about American poet Anne Sexton but couldn’t get the film rights to her life. They were both obsessed with music, in particular Anders with girl groups from the ‘60s. Douglas told her about how she used to work in the Brill Building as an assistant for infamous New York publicist Peggy Segal and that maybe they should do a film about it. As a result, Anders wrote the role of Edna/Denise specifically for Douglas. When it came to writing the screenplay, both women put a lot of personal details into it. For example, Denise’s relationship with Jay was reminiscent of Douglas and Scorsese. When Anders thought of Douglas for the film, she was looking for an actress to “embody all sorts of contradictions. I have to find the right woman to speak to other women.” However, the actress was worried about how women would react to Denise’s habit of getting involved with men who aren’t good for and tended to sidetrack her dream of recording her own album, “because women don’t want to think Edna would let a guy interrupt a career. But that’s the big secret: Women always think that being loved is much more important than being talented.”

For the first 15 miles, the two trails are completely different. They converge at Ilaniya and then diverge again at Lavi. The Gospel Trail bypasses the Horns of Hattin and the Arbel Cliffs in order to provide a gentler hiking experience. The Gospel Trail thereby skips some spectacular views which are on the Jesus Trail.
That’s because assaulting peaceful crowds in a public square demanding real democracy – economic and not just political – would remind the world of the brittle autocrats who brutalised their people demanding justice before they were swept away by the Arab Spring. And the state violence has already backfired. After police attacked a Saturday afternoon march that started from Liberty Park the crowds only got bigger and media interest grew.

He wore himself out and decided to take a nap on my sewing machine cabinet. That's when Star came out of no where and started stalking him. She creeped across the floor right up to where he was half hanging over the edge. (like he NEVER isn't hanging over the edge of whatever..) I caught sight of her and called her. She ignored me. I told her she better stop and I shook a bottle of advil at her because I've heard that if you put stones in a can and shake it it makes them stop their bad behavior but all I have close to me is drugs.

Possibly related, I think my lack of eating is causing me to get a bit irritable. I started my Invisalign journey on Monday of this week and the no snacking no soda combination is really turning my world on top of itself. If you don't know, Invisalign is an alternative to braces. It's a series of molds for your top and bottom teeth that in the end, will straighten them like braces. Except you can't see them. I've been wanting to straighten my teeth for years (yes I had braces, no I didn't wear my retainer enough) and when I saw a Groupon for a local orthodontist I decided to have a consultation. 1.5 years later my teeth are behind plastic molds. You're supposed to leave them in for 22/24 hours of the day, and I find myself paying much more attention to the amount of time it takes me to eat a sandwich and drink a soda during lunch. And of course you have to take the molds out before you eat, shovel food in your mouth, then brush your teeth and clean the molds after you eat. So I'm down to one soda per day (if that) and no snacking. Any time I think of eating something I think "is it worth it to take out "my teeth" for this?" Usually it's not worth it. Especially when I'm at work and I get to brush my teeth while folks are going to the bathroom. Gross, yes. If my waistline starts shrinking perhaps I'll see this in a different light. For now I'm chugging water and anxiously looking forward to dinner. Oh the perils of vanity.

(7) First, hardly anyone takes all the talk about hell being a place of fire and brimstone literally. The Bible uses a host of metaphors to describe this place, metaphors which would contradict each other if taken literally. So, for example, hell’s described as a place of total “darkness,” but also of “fire.” It is described as a “pit” but also as a “lake burning with brimstone.” It is described as a place of punishment, but also of total destruction. Sometimes the inhabitants are portrayed as being “cast out” from a dinner (in heaven); sometimes “cast down” into a pit; sometimes whipped as a disobedient servant. Sometimes they seem rebellious (“gnashing of teeth”), sometimes even sorrowful (Luke 6).

My mother was a very, very shy person and people thought she was quite abrupt and rude as her Finnish accent was very heavy and gave the softer Swedish language a sharpness that Swedish ears find difficult to appreciate. Once she had checked you out and approved you, she opened up and revealed an incredibly warm and funny person with an unusually big heart. She was fiercely protective of her children (me and my brother) and always ready to feed a hungry stranger. Children adored auntie Hilda, as her name was. She was very down to earth and practical, a no-nonsence/no-fuss kind of person.

The drama revolves on a legendary chancellor, Dik Yan-kit who gained the trust of the Empress Regnant (Mou Ze-tian) for being very helpful on matters, while that caught the jealousy of the empress’ nephew (Mou Sing Chi) who tried every ways (dirty ways mostly) to get rid of Yan-kit and with intention of having the throne. I like this kind of plot which would involves a lot of plans (either of brilliant strategies ones or even the dirty tricks ones). And yes, from this drama alone, we see how one goes against with another especially when having serious arguments over in the palace hall in front of the empress regnant.

And here’s what’s really dumbass. The cultural media portrays itself as wanting to make the distinction between commercial art and art that has no commercial reference. And yet it will only review books from regular publishers. Discussions of merit will range as far as obscure and forgotten *regular published* works and no further. That’s all fine and I’ve heard the arguments about how you *have* to talk about “event” books (I don’t buy the argument for a minute but I hear it and I’ll run with it) – just don’t pretend you’re talking about the fullness of art if you’re going to run that way.
But before we begin, a caveat: I BELIEVE (capitalized for emphasis) that in SOME cases, self-publishing is an appropriate choice-- such as books for niche markets, poetry chapbooks, non-fiction with a limited target market. I ALSO BELIEVE (again, capitalized for emphasis) that in the case of fiction, self-publishing should be the LAST choice, not the first.

In the future, talent leaders will find themselves managing fewer standardized assumptions and practices that can be benchmarked, as more emergent and fluid models force them to constantly adapt. The traditional, smooth intersecting processes of recruiting, on-boarding, developing and retirement that make up the hire-to-retire cycle will be supplemented by additional entry and exit points. During the next decade, we may find the hire-to-retire cycle itself should be retired, as new models of work and work relationships outpace traditional employment.

Supporters of the Conservative Party and David Cameron’s espousal of multiculturalism might like to consider some future trends. The problems associated with immigration are mass - too many - and where there are too many non-white immigrants there will be – indeed there are - too many cultural and racial antagonisms which cannot be solved or rather politicians lack the courage and the will to solve them. It can be stated unequivocally that permitting mass non-white immigration has not created some multiracial utopia. It is not going to either. In America, multiculturalism is pushing the country towards possible racial partition some time in the twenty-first century and will inevitably reduce whites to a minority. Whether an absolute catastrophe can be avoided in this country in the decades ahead remains uncertain. But some of the signs are not good. While one can remain implacably opposed to mass, non-white immigration, one can, in principle, tolerate some very limited level of non-white immigration, subject as always to the test of how the white indigenous population will benefit: lone immigrants have to adapt; they must learn English; they must adapt to our folkways, customs and traditions; they cannot live in ghettos (there are too few of them); and they can, with time, earn acceptance and respect.

As most homeschoolers know their are many benefits of homeschooling. Today I am focusing on one of them. Schedule, it's flexible! I had the intention this year of starting in Early August and adding a curriculum each week or every other week until we had them all incorporated into our days. We did start our math on August 5th and were consistent for three weekdays. Then we got a call that one of Rob's Aunt's passed away suddenly. She was the one I called during my first miscarriage. She was the one that we talked to about Rob's Mom's cancer. She was the one we talked to about the family drama was it important or silly? She was gone in an instant. We didn't even have to talk about it, we knew we were going to the funeral. I started to pack the math and then decided not to, most likely we would not have time and we had started early. It worked perfectly for us to stop and pick it up again on Monday the 22nd when we had been home over a week. We were able to take a week plus off part for travel and part for travel recuperation. Yeah for no stress!

Just know that I won’t be the one to make the first move. I leave the decision up to you. You’re the one who’s upset so you call the shots here. I tried making the first move by talking to you, and you’ve been avoiding me.

It was a long week. But I had a Friday night red-eye to Paris. I was so happy, though the flight was delayed and I couldn't keep my eyes open at 10, much less 11 or 12, and when I landed and my phone is not working. I had the usual bumps and miscommunications upon arrival. It is cold. And, after seven hours of wandering and picture-taking, I realize, I do not have the software installed to upload photos from my new camera. Hrmph.
As one of the first two participants in last month's inaugural event, I had the pleasure of choosing one of the designated ingredients for the next cocktail challenge. For inspiration, the husband and I looked to our garden to come up with an unusual yet workable element: cucumbers! Although they are in the same family as squash and gourds, and are commonly considered to be vegetables, cukes are actually closer to melons, my favorite summer fruits. So, as the Memorial Day weekend ushers in the summer season, we thought that a cucumber-y cocktail would be an excellent way of welcoming hot days and sultry nights.
A poison is a “substance that causes injury, illness, or death, especially by chemical means.” Going by this definition, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is truly a poison. HFCS is a highly processed sweetner made from corn that has been used since 1970. It continues to replace white sugar and sucrose in processed foods and is currently found in the majority of processed foods found in supermarkets. Studies have determined that Americans consume an average of 12 teaspoons a day of the sweetner. Here’s a graph depicting the rise of HFCS in our diets:

So it didn't have the layers that it has now--those all came up much later. The old picture book manuscript is kind of like a zip drive for the plot thread about the elephant's life, and then her keeper Hastin, when I added him, since they have kind of parallel lives.

If you have a passion, investigate it. See if there is anyone else who shares your passions. Groups are forming all over the internet. In some cases, there are chances to meet in person.
First off, I liked it. I liked it a lot. The story is about angels and demons, which is something I like to pounce on. Plus, the angel and demon are both guys, and both very hot (in the demon's case--literally). I thought the idea was a cool one, with both sides wanting the main character, Frannie, to be tagged by their respective teams. Once you've been tagged, it's an automatic ticket to that place. So if, say, a smokin' demon named Luc tagged you, you're going to Hell. If a drool-inducing angel named Gabe tagged you, you'll be hiking it on up to Heaven. The reason for these places to want her is... well, that'd be slightly spoiler-y.
The GOOD LORD GOD is my Light and my Salvation; I will fear no one. The Good LORD GOD protects me from all danger, I will never be afraid. When evil people attack me and try to kill me, they stumble and fall. Even if a whole army surrounds me, I will not be afraid; even if enemies attack me, I will still trust in My LORD GOD! The Only Wise GOD! The Only True GOD! The Only Living GOD! I have asked The Good LORD GOD for one thing; one thing only do I want; to live in the LORD’s House all my life, to marvel there at His goodness, in times of trouble He will shelter me; He will keep me safe in His Temple and make me secure on a high rock. So I will triumph over my enemies around me. With shouts of joy I will offer sacrifice in His Temple; I will sing, I will praise The LORD. Hear me LORD, when I call to You! Be merciful and answer me! When You said, “Come and worship me”, I answered, “I will come, LORD; don’t hide Yourself from me! Don’t be angry with me; don’t turn Your servant away. You have been my Help; don’t leave me, don’t abandon me, O GOD, My Saviour. My father and mother may abandon me, but The LORD will take care of me. Teach me, LORD, what You want me to do, and lead me along a safe path, because I have many enemies. Don’t abandon me to my enemies, who attack me with lies and threats. I know that I will live to see The LORD’s Goodness in this present life. Trust in The LORD, o my soul! Have faith, do not despair. Trust in The LORD! Amen!

ARTSblog had a new post recently that detailed the results of a ten year study on Arts patron behavior. And these findings should be of interest to any artist or person who cares about the place of the Arts in peoples lives. This is some of what the author had to say:
One thought that we had regarding this tendency has to do with what is perceived as "advanced" technique in this country. That is, when beginners dance there is a tendency to muscle the lead and follow in a manner that is rough and inelegant. So perhaps among more experienced dancers here, the reaction against that "amateurishness" is to move away from muscularity as much as possible, the result being on the other extreme, where the lead/follow become so much of a subtle suggestion that it is almost non-existent, and there is very little actually felt in the exchange. It is this lack of feeling that my friend finds unsatisfying. If I understood her correctly, she feels it's as if each dancer is expected to bear responsibility for their own energy without tapping into or feeding the others', and that makes her feel separated from her partner.

The rolls were golden and risen so I smiled back and reached for my purse, then jumped back in alarm as a small brown object landed with a thump on the table. The woman screeched and I took a closer look at the thing, then gasped. It was a sparrow.
When I write these messages each week, three and a half decades later, I am very much aware of the lessons I learned in that freshman year 7:30 AM History class about clarity in writing and still seek to be as clear as I can be each week.
As part of the TOS review crew, I had the opportunity to review a pilot copy of WORLD (magazine's) new writing curriculum. Set to officially launch this fall, complete with interactive website, Write with WORLD is written for use by middle-schoolers, and is a non-consumable text (which you have to love if you have 12 kids ;).
2. Don't crochet over the end. Most people are taught to weave in ends that way and it's an almost certain to destroy your project. It's soooo easy for the ends to be tugged at and pulled out of your project.
See you later with my first Inky Impressions challenge card - yes I know I said that yesterday too - but I never know what day of the week is which for which challenge - if you know what I mean - I'm amazed I get here at all sometimes!!
From Goodreads: Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol-- a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.
This spell forces a single creature not of this realm (other planar) to return to its plane. The creature throws against its Magical Strength and its Effect is compared to the caster’s. If the caster’s Effect is equal to or greater than the creature’s, the creature is banished. If the effect is less, the creature is unaffected. A caster may attempt a second banishment against the same creature at a cost of 4. A third attempt can be made at a cost of 8. If a third attempt fails, the caster is physically enslaved to the wishes of the creature he tried to banish - his mind free, but his body captive.

Tomorrow I have a 10-miler with my group at 8am. I even turned down a date tonight so that I could eat right and get to bed on time to be sure that I make it and have a good run. I’m so proud of me!
This steel sculpture, engineered by Cecil Balmond, begins Kapoor and Balmond's unexpected career as monumental sculptors to late British neoliberalism, but is less embarrassing than the hot pink 'Arcelor-Mittal Orbit'. A stretched tendon, it is both industrial and biomorphic, with the tautness between its opposed sides evidently a 'reference' to the Transporter Bridge. But looking at the Tees' surviving industry – the Bridge, the shipbuilding cranes, the curvaceous maw of the distant cooling towers, the intertwined tentacles of the nearby refineries - who can say that Kapoor and Balmond are better artists than these anonymous engineers?

They have done it. They have destroyed reputations. They have permanently ruined relationships. They have cut down a child's spirit and attempted to take away something that means so much to her... and have largely succeeded. They have no remorse and have no interest in reconciling or repairing damage done. And as of today... their actions have pushed an adult involved (not a member of our family) to abandon a job which she loves even though she did her best to love them and meet their needs.
For all of us who have solutions outside of the mainstream, institutionalized models, I really do believe the best way forward is to speak up! The more voices, the better. :-)
Also, my eyes? They cannot stay open. Being a Texan, I stayed up until 1am to watch the Rangers game... it was ugly and stressful and intense, and it made me wish I were in my bed asleep, yet I could not. stop. watching. So I went to bed at 1:30 and woke up at 4:50 to get ready for work to come in early. Yes, your math is correct-- I'm currently running on a whopping 3 hours and 20 minutes of sleep. My body? It is le tired. Honestly, I haven't had much sleep in over a week. Since the move, we've just been constantly going going going, either running errands or unpacking boxes or racing all over hell and back for pieces of our Halloween costumes...
We were only here for about an hour because it was rather chilly near the water due to the high wind and we were not prepared for the conditions. Once we decided to call it quits due to our hands becoming a little numb we headed out only to run into a police officer. His name was mike and it just happens that he was watching us for awhile and he wanted to let us know a little about the numerous birds that could be found at the reservoir. Turns out he is an amateur photographer and he pulled out his iphone and I have to say he had some of the most amazing photos of birds that I have seen taken on a phone period!! Granted he is at this park 12 hours a day for 4 days a week but still I could not believe that they were all taken on his iphone. He mentioned that he has come across the Wilson Storm Petrel, Red Tailed Hawk and a Red-winged Blackbird. We chatted with him for a good 1/2 an hour and we decided then and there that we would come back when we had a good portion of a day to spend there.
He stepped back as they reached the ground floor and the doors opened allowing her to walk ahead, ever the gentleman. In reality it gave him a chance to view her legs and arse as she walked in front of him. The sunlight streaming in through the bay windows made her skirt transparent and he caught a glimpse of a tiny white g-string hugged by two of the sweetest peachiest cheeks he’d ever seen. Looking back she caught the direction of his gaze and smiled, he looked up and their eyes blazed at each other caught in a momentary understanding of what the other was thinking. An invisible spark was lit and now was burning slowly.

Second, we must remind ourselves of what Christ has done on the cross. We will never want to face with our sin if we are not convinced we have the solution for it. That solution is Christ who has paid the full penalty for my sin and has credited me with his perfect life and obedience (Col. 2:13-14).
But once child 2, 3, and then 4 came along, nap time became null-n-void for me. It didn't matter that baby 4 and child 2 were napping. I still had child 1 and 3 to contend with, plus housework, phone calls, and organizing bills. Showers were few and far between for me for a few years. (I think there is a span of about four years where few photos can be found of me. lol) During those years, anyone aiming a camera at me did it at their own risk.

I’ve been pleased with the reviews I received on The Ride. Yes, I paused here to knock on wood. OK…it was the side of my head, but let’s not worry about details.
The thing that I struggled with at the beginning was that I wanted Allie to be a really gifted cyclist. As I started writing, I realized I couldn’t have Allie be the narrator because I wanted the narrator to admire Allie. That’s when I knew this would be the story of two girls, not just one. And of course Joe just showed up at the truck stop and Sadie was attracted to him immediately. I wasn’t expecting him, but there he was, and it was kind of funny to cram him into an over-crowded house where he wouldn’t be Sadie’s cousin at all, and he had enough of his own issues that he was there to stay. And Sadie couldn’t help falling for him…

Well…when I thought I was ready, Elaine definitely wasn’t. And when I was scared out of my shoes about failing again, Elaine decided to be ready. It was the easiest thing in the world. She practically taught herself with a little gentle guidance from Mommy and Daddy. So it is true – when they are ready, they are ready. Introduce the potty chair. Demonstrate the concept. Try – it’s okay if you fail. Just wait a while and try again. Don’t force it - wait for them to be ready. And then it will be easy.

Second, Keener notes the general character of the population of Jesus’ day, that is, his audience: “Most of the Roman Empire’s inhabitants were rural peasant farmers or herders. The literate elite often ignored this large population, but Jesus’ illustrations show that he ministered frequently among this class. Although Galilee was heavily populated with villages and boasted two major cities (Sepphoris and Tiberias), most of its inhabitants were rural, agrarian peasants.”
As I prepare for life after Corporate America, I am trying to leave my team at work with a few foundational principles to serve as guides for the work that they will do in my absence. I'm a big believer in guiding principles in the workplace; they are an absolute key to staying aligned with the required tasks no matter how strongly others may try to sway and distract you. The right guiding principles can be the difference between success and failure of any project or organization. It is critical to operate upon some foundation in order to build and grow.
I have adapted a few new philosophies too:

Pila was given the honorific title “villa” which was reserved for the rich and culturally avant-garde communities in Spanish Philippines. Sadly, most of the Villas has failed to retain its old character. Among the eight Philippine Villa’s, only Pila and Vigan succeeded in maintaining the original town layout and the important bahay na bato’s.

How did the church scandals happen? How could they have been so extensive? Why were the victims treated as culprits, and the culprits protected? Well, people made up their minds. They made a choice. People decided who to trust and what to believe. And anything they saw or heard that did not conform to those choices, those facts simply were not allowed to exist.
I'll just make a quick post, with my last (fav) pics from New York 'cause I don't wanna make you bored.. :D

My interest in comics was re-sparked recently. I’ve bought them on and off since the 90s depending on cash flow. Since childhood Batman has been the absolute pinnacle of superheroes to me. The Adam West show, Superfriends, Batman: The Animated Series, the live action films from 1989 to 2008, and beyond has made me a hardcore Batman fan! My latest enthusiasm lead me to take an interest in the DC animated movie Batman: Under The Red Hood. There is some background to offer with this review on Batman comic history. In the 1980s, DC Comics decided to mature Dick Grayson, the original Robin, into his own man and became Nightwing. Batman was now without a sidekick, and DC hurried a new Robin into the comics. His name was Jason Todd. After a company wide continuity revamp called Crisis on Infinite Earths, what was previously a poorly conceived Dick Grayson carbon copy was changed into a punk kid that divided fans. So, a storyline was developed where the fans would call a 900 number to determine Jason’s fate. The vote came down to about 72 for Jason’s death at the hands of the Joker. About twenty years later, the choice was made to resurrect Jason Todd as a Batman villain in the guise of the Red Hood – the Joker’s original criminal identity. This animated movie adapts that story, and I feel it delivers an excellent piece of entertainment. Of course, this comes from someone who never read the “A Death in the Family” or “Under The Hood” graphic novels.

It seems to me that the contextual communication is overriding the direct one. It is not what I am saying and what the energy behind my words is. It is rather who I am. You see, I am an adult and they are teenagers, kids. From their perception I am from the hostile tribe of grown-ups who don’t listen, who don’t hear, who don’t pay attention and who don’t give a damn about kids’ needs, feelings, inner worlds, opinions, perceptions…
Anyway I got an unexpected package from John of Pursuit of 80's(ness) the other day. In the package was a stack of 2010 Ginter and also six new minis. Theres no pictures today since my camera is still without batteries.

It was written just over 50 years ago, and therefore feels somewhat dated. The segregation laws described no longer exist – thank goodness – and people are more enlightened. However, there is no doubt that racism still exists, and this is one man’s account of his personal experience of it. It may not teach us anything we didn’t already know, but it is certainly interesting and disturbing reading.
The truth was right in front of Woodward. His refusal to see it made him a willing or witless collaborator in the ruin of the reputation and career of an honorable pubic servant, Patrick Gray.
All this week I looked around our yard, waiting to see those little leaves poking through the soil, leaves that would give way to pretty blossoms, aka the fruits of my sweaty labor. It wasn't premature. It's spring. Besides, everyone in our fricken neighborhood is a landscaper. I know hostas and other fluffy flowers are blooming. I can see them all from my window.
The foam was thicker than I thought it would be. Plus, it only took one pass with the paper towel to get all of the dirt and drool off. With other products this often takes me two to three applications to get a clean look...even better, the smell was very mild. All of these things equal l.o.v.e.
Buddha: Sounds good.
John Carter has received fairly mixed reviews (currently 51% at Rotten Tomatoes) and this is not without reason. The characters feel stamped out of an archetype cookie-cutter, the dialog borders on the contrived, its predictable, and ultimately, its become a well-trodden genre. Between 1917 and 2012, Edgar Rice Burroughs’ ideas have inspired hundreds of books and movies, and by now we’ve “seen it all before.” – So once again, it comes down to you. Will you appreciate this seminal work and all it went on to influence and inspire? Or will you be the next ignorant fanboy who says “this ripped off Phantom Menace!” (don’t worry, John Carter has no Jar-Jar Binks.)
Sam: Making a machine
Office Space is still some funny shit, and Dilbert...well, Dilbert used to be some funny shit, but while McDonald's is late to the specialty-coffee game by about 15 years, they're also still holding onto a late-90s office-malaise mentality that was never fucking true to begin with. Cubicle workers in office parks are not brave downtrodden masses to be pitied as they chug overworked and under-recognized through the faceless, soulless corporate machine. They're educated, middle-class, have access to the company gym, and need to stop bitching about having to ridé the shuttlé.
Some things have changed since I last worked here. In Kerry – and, the locals tell me, now in the rest of he Republic – you are taxed on the amount of rubbish you produce. As an inevitable result, people put padlocks on their wastebins to prevent other people putting extraneous garbage into their bins. There are also tax discs on rubbish bins.

Italy is in a world of hurt, no doubt. Despite all the talk of austerity and eliminating the budget deficit by 2013, recently released central bank figures from Banca d’Italia showed that the 2011 state budget balance actually deteriorated by 11.49%.

As I walk through into the living room, I look at my old and crappy orange typewriter. Beside it lays sheets of A4. Stacked with all the lines that have been falling from my head lately. Stories about love, the stars, unknown faces and whatever else takes me fancy. I begin to pour myself a drink.
Last year I traded some DS Quilts fabric on Etsy (probably not officially allowed) for a dress from Wild Olive Kids. I asked the owner for any advice to learn to sew dresses, and she said to pick a good pattern and practice. So I picked the Reese pattern specifically for its versatility with sleeves, ruffles, different fabrics, etc. I am so happy I did! I also bought two other dress patterns and plan to put them to use when it gets a little warmer out since they are summer styles.

Finally, wear gloves anytime you will be utilizing large volumes of rapid-fire rifle fire, as part of your fighting load-out. From inadvertently grabbing a smoking hot rifle barrel (been there, done that) on accident, to diving into a pile of rocks for cover (or landing on a cactus!), there are countless ways in a gunfight to tear your hands up, bad enough to make you combat-ineffective. Even expensive gloves are a cheap insurance policy, with the added bonus that you don't have to worry about adding camouflage face-paint to your hands. While there are myriad high-end tactical cool-guy gloves out there with high-impact polymer knuckles and kevlar reinforced palms, among other features, I still wear the old-school cool-guy Nomex aviator's
My niece is a fantastic musician and is a member of one of the North Lanarkshire Schools Music Groups. Their spring concert showcases the talents of around four hundred young people in the county. There was a range of different musical styles in the concert including jazz, rock, classical and traditional. There is a pipe band, a woodwind orchestra, a symphony orchestra, as well as a development group for younger children. Every single piece of music was delivered with professional levels of musical ability, timing and polish.

The old tale of Rumplestiltskin comes into play here. That mischievous imp came into the life of a young woman and tormented her to no end. The only way to put a stop to his antics was to guess his name, which she did. He promptly vanished, and his reign of terror was over.

The CCGPF has spent 4 months focusing on compiling the water quality data on upper Namskaket marsh and Hurley's Bog. Independent testing has been conducted for comparison purposes. Individual members of the Orleans' Citizens Peer Review Panel have been providing assistance in interpreting the results from the sources named in their report. To my knowledge this is the very first time that this information on water quality on Namskaket has ever been assembled in one report and disseminated to the public in a layperson format.

Honestly, the worst part of Earl was the anticipation and the ruckus it caused. People stocking up on water, canned good, batteries and gas. It took me thirty minutes to get to the pump at BJs. Which was totally worth it because I only paid $2.36/gallon!!! I don't know if anyone else out there has gas for cheaper but here that is great.

In 2011, a third of the charity’s youth programs saw a reduction in contributions. For another 31 percent of them, donations remained flat.

Luckily, before Freyfaxi could run me straight off the edge of a cliff, Begga caught us, scolded me gently for not scolding him harder, and led us back to the group, who had been waiting patiently for God knows how long. So we continued forth and Freyfaxi seemed to behave himself from that point on, presumably because he knew of the upcoming photo shoot:
Charities are anxious to be involved in government decision-making, so to step out of that conversation was a difficult choice. In his resignation letter, Farmer told Chris Grayling, the employment minister: “We have reached the point where we feel that the lack of progress in improving the system and the lack of willingness to consider more fundamental reform makes our involvement in this element of the process no longer tenable.”
Since we already had 7,000 pigs to work with and learn about, my little sister and I decided to show market lambs through 4-H, to diversify our livestock experience. Each winter, we traveled with Dad to pick out our show lambs. We worked through the spring to train them, and develop a nutrition and exercise program. During the summer and fall, we traveled around the state showing our lambs. This experience reinforced hard work, responsibility, persistence and gave us many, wonderful family memories. After 10 years of showing, our hard work paid off when my sister, Lynsie, won Grand Champion Market Lamb at the Illinois State Fair!
The job I quit in Las Vegas to move with James to the east coast was a full-time Administrative Assistant position at a corporate office for a hospitality company where I had worked for the previous 3 years. My current position is as a full-time Administrative Assistant for a hotel company and I directly support an International Head, Vice President, and more than a handful of Directors. I absolutely love my job and the environment I get to work in. The people are fantastic and the brands we represent are, without a doubt, the best of the best – in the world.

His doubt spanned more than a moment, more than a thought. He couldn’t shake the doubt off, nor was he about to blindly believe.
I told her “friends” don’t screw other friend’s husbands so no – you’re not my friend. I will tell you exactly what I told your buddy WC, you are not welcome and it would not be a wise decision to show up. Brenda was also upset, could see things only from her pespective as to how much she missed Rob and was so sorry he’d died. I told her I really didn’t give a damn how she felt, that I had a memorial to attend and that I couldn’t believe the selfishness or stupidity of both she and WC to be calling me the morning of the memorial. I told her she’d done more than enough damage and that I never wanted to hear from her again and hung up.
On a more positive side, let’s consider those ‘astrologically ideal dates.’ If I believe that I will achieve greater success by tying an important decision/action to a given date, and I proceed with positive expectation to that launch date… well, what is the outcome? I’m taking action. I’m proceeding with a high level of harmony about the present and future. I’m excited and full of goodwill and gratitude. Truly, with all of that on my side, can the future be in any doubt?
I am humbled.

Another subject I will touch on is something I mentioned in my “Opinions of the world around me” blog, and that’s the child aspect of it. I talked a bit about it but now I will go more in-depth with it. Just like men and women, children deserve respect as well. The problem is, neither of them gives it to them. Children deserve a lot more than we do because they are growing, learning and figuring out the world around them. They drive us mad, they make awe moments, they push our buttons, they make cute faces; it’s what kids do. Parenthood is one job that is 24/7/365 and is probably the most difficult but most rewarding job anyone could ever have; no matter whether you’re flipping burgers or the CEO of the largest company on the planet; parenthood tops it all. This brings me to a question; why is it that parents feel the need to disrespect their kids? The answer; I don’t know, every parents thinks differently.

Why all the press? Because Free-Range Kids is a movement whose time has come. We are a growing group of people who believe that when kids are allowed – expected! — to play outside, help out around the house and wrestle their way out of boredom, they grow up confident and happy. Instead of trying to Botox them full of self-esteem with trophies for losing, they get it the old-fashioned way — by actually doing stuff on their own.
-A way to tell if you got a hotspot is when you fail to get the message, "but you find nothing." However, that sometimes pops up even when it is the hotspot. I recommend digging in one spot three times. If you get the, "but you find nothing" message three times, move onto the next.

The first year apart was horrible. Everything reminded me of them. I cried every day. I felt like a failure as a mother. My whole identity — the woman I had been for ten years, stay-at-home Super Awesome Mommy Extreme, was being torn apart. I had made a huge sacrifice and wondered in every moment if it was the right choice. Was I hurting my children? Would they be happy? Did I do the right thing? And who was I, if not Super Awesome Mommy Extreme? (I wrote a column about that first year over at Literary Mama.)

There was one occupational hazard. When Kaminsky, who is five foot-nine, became the Underground Gourmet, he weighed 172 pounds and wore trousers with 34-inch waistbands. After a few years on the job, he had crossed the 200-pound line and struggled to wiggle into XL T-shirts and 38-inch pants. The wake-up call came when his life insurance renewal was denied. “The choice was clear,” he writes. “Mend my munching or fast-forward to Judgment Day.”

And then I thought it’d be interesting if one of the things the main character was OCD about was Converse. And then I just needed a reason why he would be obsessed with that particular brand. And then the light bulb hit – his name should be Chuck Taylor! To be honest, I’m not really sure how I got from that point to using a different color to match each mood. I think that was just a happy accident that came from trying to flesh out the character and how he would express himself.

I am blessed. I am a very rich woman. I love my family deeply, and I am loved greatly by my husband and children in return. I am blessed beyond this beautiful day. I am blessed in love.
As soon as I walked into my kitchen in my apartment, I realized that my weekend of eating out was over and I needed to go grocery shopping ASAP. My fridge was bare, aside from a tub of Earth Balance, mustard, marinated artichokes, almond milk, a half bottle of wine, and mini-tortillas. I didn’t have any cereal or fruit or anything to snack on. I went to bed pretty hungry last night (after eating my very last veggie burger from the freezer) and woke up without a scrap to eat for breakfast. I was forced to go shopping on an empty stomach–dangerous–and wait until I’d checked out to scarf down a vegan muffin and Odwalla smoothie juice box (which btw, I didn’t know they made in that size–a pleasant surprise).
So yeah, Monday, you suck!

Mickey's Christmas Special ... ABC Family ... 6 PM
Kobe is blessed with playing in a league where it is nowhere near as physical a game as it was when Jordan played. The NBA is catered to offense because fans rather see an offensive game than a low scoring defensive struggle. It’s like that in baseball, hence the American League adopting the DH. It’s like that in Football which is why we saw 3 QB’s eclipse the 5,000 yard passing mark this year while only seeing twice before that. Kobe still averages less points per game. Kobe has only scored over 30ppg twice in his career while Jordan has done it 8 times. Kobe is a prolific scorer but has only won the scoring title twice while coming very close to grabbing his third this year. Jordan won the scoring title 10 times. Kobe has one MVP award. He probably deserved maybe a few more, but never got it. Jordan won MVP 5 times second to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 6. Jordan probably deserved it every year from 1987-1998.
Machine Mole was very much Robert Wyatt's band. The name is a play on the french phrase for Soft Machine ( Machine Molle). It is a strange album. Lovely and odd at times. Ear wrenching especially on Side Two.
The theory underlying the book is that of “world systems” analysis, which emphasizes that capitalism is a global system that changes and mutates over time and therefore must be analyzed as a single unit rather than as a collection of nation-states. Crucial to this understanding is recognizing the global division of labor that forms the basis for a division of the world’s countries into one of three broad categories: core, semi-periphery and periphery, with the latter two subordinate to the core countries and the periphery the most exploited.

6. I love my job
UPDATE: Just got a voicemail from A letting me know that she’s been out of the house for two weeks now (which I knew) and she had issues with B bringing people around and trying to put their hands on her, and dealing with other violence, and had to get out. She said there’s no talking to her, she’s crazy – awesome. She also said that B knows they had to be out, she doesn’t know why she’s not leaving. This just solidifies our need to get the courts involved and this crazy person out of our life. Both voicemails are saved and will be used in court if necessary, although I don’t think it will come to that.
There are a lot of things in life that probably technically matter which I don't often get done. But I feel pretty good about the choices I make thinking about the way my infant son already recognized me.

All things considered, I think this confession, or something along the same lines, is the happiest medium between something as inclusive as “Christ is Lord” and as exclusive as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. It has all the essentials for basic Christian belief, it allows room for one to be captive to his/her conscience, and it isn’t unnecessarily exclusive. Moreover — and this is the important part — it provides a core of teaching that would allow Christians from different traditions and backgrounds to recognize each other for what they both really are: members of the body of Christ. It is, in sum, a tool for unity, rather than division.

When we seek to see the Spirit in others in this way, strangers as well as friends, we are taking the first and very necessary step to becoming aware of that Spirit. In many cultures, looking into other people’s eyes is the highest honor we can pay them. Becoming committed to doing this, increases our peace of mind while showing others that they matter to us, too. Honoring others in this way may not feel natural at first, but if they have crossed our path, this is what we have been called to do.”

The identification of these hotspot areas is essential for helping these endemic species to find a safe and protected habitat.

“The sources in Pretoria, which has maintained regular contact with Col Gaddafi, said the South African government was hoping to arrange an exile, possibly to Venezuela, Russia or Cuba, and had a plane on standby in Tunisia (not Libya). That could mean the leader escaping trial at the International Criminal Court, to which neither Cuba nor Russia is a signatory.” - (Full report here)

On the same day for the last six years, I skipped class to sneak into the intern’s lecture. I had the procedure perfected now. When the morning’s cleaning staff finished their last sweep of the castle, I was already in the shadows outside the giant double doors. I counted to ten. Then I hurried inside and slipped down the hall to the left.
Interns in the office can get fairly complex tasks that I have to explain and then do a few examples, etc. This will be difficult with a virtual intern. Hence, requirement number four: You must be able to work independently. You must have the intelligence to figure out what needs to be done and the confidence to then do it. Examples? I have no idea. I've never had a "virtual" intern before.
It has a really classic feel to it, one to dip into now and come back to for years to come. Pages are nicely laid out and the recipes are easy to follow. Every recipe is certainly not pictured, but the recipes where there are pictures make them very homely and do-able – the biscuits are the stars.
The weekend began with a Welcome Gala at Buddakan. At the Gala, I was able to meet two major influences in the culinary world: Ruth Reichl and Tom Colicchio. The three hour event was amazing – great food, delicious drinks, amazing setting, and I got to talk to Ruth?! And the weekend was just beginning!
In addition, I need to find a better place for our birds and located their nest box before they start laying eggs on the bottom of the cage. They seem to be inspired by this weather also and are showing signs of the egg laying behavior from last year. We never had any fertilized eggs so I don’t expect any this time but you never know.
Partridges’s life in the dome is something else entirely. Here there is order, and law. Teens are schooled, trained, and prepared for the day they will step outside the dome and reclaim the world.

I am watching my new ex batt girls - and trying not to think about the disturbing behaviour they are all showing me - like the piling on top of each other even though there is loads of room and a heater so it can't be for warmth...and the hunched, head down postures when flapping their wings - even though there is no longer a cage around them to stop their movements. :-(
I was at school the day they started the preparations. I was cleaning the room next door, when the teachers were asking the kids what part they would like to play. They left it pretty open-ended, but just required sticking to the recent learning units on Oceans and Dinosaurs. The boys all chose "paleontologist" or "shark" or "dinosaur." EVERY single girl said "I want to be a mermaid", then, it came to Hattie near the end. She said "I want to be a triceratops." She was the only one who was specific about the kind of dinosaur and the only girl who didn't go for the mermaid. Kind of radical for Hattie! After she asked for the triceratops role, 2 fellow class-mates, a boy, and a girl, both changed their minds and asked if they could be triceratops with Harriet. So, the class play was written around the triceratops family. I thought that was pretty cool considering Hattie is the most over-looked, quiet, shy, never making waves, never taking on leadership, kind of student.

A few days ago I was watching the Ellen DeGeneras show and Taylor Swift was her feature guest. She was well spoken, dressed to perfection, and of course her quirky charming self. She has this ability to make you listen to and believe every word that comes out of her mouth. That’s when it hit me. The Taylor Swift that my college friends and I used to belt out and dance around the house to is much more than a musician. My fashionista and PR brain kicked into action. I realized, I love Taylor Swift for two very different reasons. First, her fashion sense is impeccable. I would wear every dress I have ever seen her in. Second, she is a model for best practices when it comes to using the web and Facebook to engage an audience.
5. Staines' Trumpet Concerto in E
I used to hang out a lot with Val in the Playboy office in Park Lane. Val didn’t invite me to the lavish Playboy parties held in Stocks mansion though. His dad Victor did. Once, I was invited to a 24 hour party there, and was allocated a bedroom to sleep in for the night, but all I did was park my clothes there. The fabulous fireworks displays at Stocks were almost as impressive as the New Millennium explosions. I even went up in a helicopter ride at one of the parties and was sick too. The endless food and drink were lavish, and it was fun watching all the middle aged playboys frolicking in the hot-tub with bunnies young enough to be their daughters. Apparently, the sex/wife-swapping stuff happened in the bedrooms upstairs, but from my point of view on the mansion’s grounds, the proceedings seemed sanitised. All the playgirls had cleavages down to their toes, and the men generally wore a load of gold on their hairy chests, with shirts unbuttoned down to their navels. At one party I went to called ‘The 100 Most Eligible men in the World’, an Australian girl dressed up as Marilyn Monroe was resigned to not meeting her soul-mate at the bash. ’No wonder they’re eligible. Nobody wants them,’ she sighed, fighting off the coked up millionaires. I had to agree with her. I didn’t fancy any of the playboys, and they didn’t fancy me because I wasn’t a Pamela Anderson clone. However, a Viscount offered to drive me home. We had a good old bitch-fest about the party, which lasted all the way from the Stocks mansion in Hertfordshire to central London.

I want people to be comfortable, and I'm not going to tell anyone what to wear, but a sharp three-piece suit and a fedora looks a lot nicer than a pair of skinny jeans and a flannel. Hell, even middle class and poor people back in the day wore suits; they may have been lower quality materials, but they still wore them nonetheless.

Of course, the keener witted amongst you will already have guessed that very little in the way of creative endeavour has taken place over the last 24 months. All the great plans to make the creative stuff pay have - as usual - come to nought; although there was that rather appealing offer from the United Arab Emirates, sadly hastily withdrawn once they were appraised of the fact that those *really* *were* chicken fillets. Of course, with hindsight I might, given the desperate plight of the economy and the dire projections for the year ahead, have been wiser to have kept the old nose to the grindstone for those 480 or so hours and pocketed the cash for that oh-so imminent rainy day.

It’s the first time she wins a laugh from us, but it’s far from the last. Olivia is warm and forthcoming with her audience; she displays a quirky, irreverent wit, and reveals a more vulnerable aspect when she confesses to having nights during her illness where she would wake up in her bed, afraid. “I thought I was going to retire,” she says in her husky voice, “but then I realized I could never give into it.” You get a sense, she relies greatly on the members of her band whom she treats like old friends: Marlen Landin Chapman and Steve Real Y Vasquez are on vocals, Timothy McDonald on keys, her long time music director Andrew Timmons on guitar, Warren Ham on horns and vocals, Matthew Mc Kenzie on bass and Mark Beckett on drums.

I woke up on the morning of September 28, 1996 feeling as I had for the last several weeks, like I'd be pregnant forever and starving. Whenever I look back on that day a surreal and eerie feeling comes over me, knowing how oblivious I was to the events that were about to unfold. Not only was I going into labor that day, but I was going into a battle that had bittersweet consequences. A battle that I lost, but set me up to fight a war I intend on winning.
The upshot of it was that I found myself hired

When I got home, with the worst possible consequence playing on my mind, I decided to give Children with Cancer UK a call to tell them the worst case scenario and find out my options for deferring my place etc. Apparently I can’t defer my place with them. So a runner with a ballot place can defer, but a Golden Bond runner can’t??? Their reason was simply that they can’t guarantee how many places they will have next year so can’t guarantee me a spot. Surely they’ll have more than one to give away though? It seems totally ridiculous to me, so my plan of action if I can’t run is now to get hold of the London Marathon folk direct to see what they say.
As for Lil C?
I’m not going to go further because with Episode 3, which takes place 20 years on, people start dying. It’s enough to say that episodes 3 and 4 continue the supernatural mysteries and continue to be strong. When we get to episodes 5 and 6 (which is a two-part story that takes place 30 years after episode 4), we turn from mystery to the final act, which is a high fantasy angels vs. immortals throwdown with Rin as the prize in the middle. Rin has lost her mind (even though she’s immortal, she dies and then regenerates) due to a particularly violent death and long regeneration and the story is pretty melodramatic as a result. Mimi is now living in a temple filled with immortal women which would be a dramatic character change if we’d seen more of her pre-temple life. There are some things that work better with a longer history and this is one of them.
But some politicians clearly do not get bogged down in these gloomy prospects. The Tories are having a bunfight over who has the most influence via their bizarre backbench 1922 committee. Apparently it is too dominated by the old guard. The Guardian has covered it in detail but I particularly thought this bit deserved the unprintable response I uttered through my muesli. It’s about the Tories’ poor poll ratings.

So today, I saw that my friend Tony nominated me as a Versatile Blogger, and I realized, I’m never gonna get all this stuff on my list accomplished, so instead, I ‘m just gonna say that I am completely in awe anytime someone says they love my blog. For as long as I can remember, writing has been my outlet, my way of dealing with life. The more I follow other blogs, the more I see that I’m not as different as I used to think I was. I do share common threads after all. I don’t know why I always wondered if anyone could really relate to me, but I’m glad that I’m finding out that indeed, many people do. Maybe they don’t live in a zoo with 7 kids, 4 dogs, 2 cats, a few turtles, some frogs and lizards and fish, oh, and the bird, let’s not forget the bird who whistles all day because she’s sexy and she knows it! Maybe not everyone is drowning under a pile of stinky laundry that is forever in rotation but never finished in a house that is always in some state of remodeling. Maybe no one else is married to a man people call chicken who came home with a truck full of wild hogs on Saturday and bbq’d them on Sunday, but somewhere in all that chaos, it seems that everyone finds a point at which they totally get me, and hearing that makes this journey even more fulfilling.

However, those who aren’t close to this case when it comes to locale, will not have the same thoughts that O-towners have. Those who were there from the beginning. Those who frequented the same clubs that she visited. Those who stood in the parking lots at night after Casey Anthonys trips to her favorite bar, walked the same streets, went to the same school, lived in the same neighborhood. They will have plenty more to say. It hits closer to home. Clear Water is clearly not far enough. But does that place exist?

There are also sporadic protests for broader social issues like women’s rights – on 8 March 2012, International Women’s Day, there were 4 separate women’s movements holding protest marches in Nouakchott
There are things I would’ve done differently, but this is what we could afford to do. We’ll have to part from our furniture as we’ll be living in a furnished housing. It makes me sad to think that we won’t be with our furniture after this summer, but I am very looking forward to decorating our new home!
Not only is Chance Encounters an Indie read, but today is its birthday! I think this may be the first time I've been able to review a book on its launch day, a very fun milestone.

Lately, I've bought a lot of card stock because I was making some wedding invitations for a friend from church. However, my most recent purchase (and a little more exciting than card stock) was the Taylored Expressions Love Grows Here set. I love it! I plan to make some card sets as gifts with it. I can't wait!
The story published in the Enterprise reciting the slaughter of a family near Empire was all a fiction. It was understood to be such by all acquainted with the locality in which the alleged affair occurred. In the first place, Empire City and Dutch Nick's are one, and in the next there is no "great pine forest" nearer than the Sierra Nevada mountains, etc.
Jon Turner, Island’s current marketing director stretches out his hand. Great to see you, come in for a coffee and a chat? Stiff co-founder Dave Robinson wanders by offering a quick, Call me, lets meet for a coffee; the legend in his own lunchtime that is John (Knocker) Knowles – one of my earliest bosses when Island’s sales force was in full cry – proffers and affectionate but bristle-bearded kiss on my cheek. You look well, Cory – been ill or somewhere nice? Give me a call, come in and have a coffee. You goin' downstairs..? Its fucking loud, PJ Harvey’s just come on and she’s heavier than Zeppelin. Knocker grimaces and plods off into the night.
Can I just say these were absolutely stupendous burgers! Bravo Habits! Cooked to perfection, oozing with flavor, ingenious topping combinations! I know it's only our second burger but it is leading the pack.
The government's great many foreign-aid-funded schemes to replace these efficient farmers with thus far, some 1-million 'new black farmers' are proving to be a resounding failure. These 1million farmers are primarily subsistence: producing food for their own extended clans but selling very little excess food for use by the rest of the population.
Today was my 2nd 50 minute slot. I trudged through the rain down to the counselling centre, cursing for having to get up so early. My counsellor called me in and we started. For a while it was slow. My new counsellor is nice, but she often gives me blank looks which worry me that I’m either a. not making sense or b. actually a little insane. After a while she started to prod deeper and I opened up more about why I get annoyed with my housemates A + B. She tells me I need to confront them about how I am feeling. Yep, I know this, I’m just too scared to rock the boat. My counsellor pounced upon this fact and we talked through a full dissection of my life and why I don’t want to rock the boat for anyone.
So, God, I got it. Don't worry. We'll be okay. Whichever path is ours. It'll be okay. Very delayed or not. Walking or not. She's happy, healthy, and here, and that is amazing. Thank you!

There was a certain joy in sharing a part of you with the kids. Having an Indian teacher was a rarity in itself. But more than that, they used to get something new from each of the volunteers that walked into their class. Most surprisingly, I remember teaching them the ancient art of Pranayam because breathing exercises was actually part of their curriculum. And naturally, I grew very fond of them as we would start the day together singing ´Buenos Dias..´, doing all activities together and even taking them to brush their teeth.

The VSF from last year is still in boxes but I do really want to paint it. My Infinity ALEPH force has been usurped by my Nomads but it is the only army I have painted everything for, my loft contains the makings of a Pre-Heresy Emperor’s Children force (I don’t even play 40k but it appears to be a good challenge) and I have a German Panzer Army for Flames of War that may never see light again.

Death is another key element in this movie. Miron’s wife Tanya is dead early in the film. The Merjan rituals of preparing the dead for their last journey take up a chunk of the film. The journey to the river to consign the dead to flames and the waters of the river provides opportunity for “smoking.” “Smoking,” for the Merjans, is when intimate details of the dead are revealed to close friends to facilitate emotional release for the bereaved, a rough parallel with the Irish “wake.”

Lady Julianne Gatewick has been in love with one man for a long time and now she needs to show him but every time she tries he treats her like a child. Worse he treats her like his sister. She thought with him as her guardian she would have a chance but when it dwindles she comes up with a plan thanks to his outlandish Aunt she will find the way to seduce a rake.

Pours a nice dark amber to brown color with a decent head. The beers smells of excellent raisin, caramel malt, brown sugar, and a touch of citrus hops. All very strong overall. YES YES YES. The beer tastes of caramel malt, raisin, brown or white sugar, hops are very balanced, a pinch of sourness, and amazingly it finishes pretty quick. We actually starting drinking this cold, and let it warm up over time. I am absolutely loving the very English level of smoothness with the cutting hops to keep it from getting too sweet. I could see myself just drinking a ton of this beer. I love a good Old Ale, but this cat improved on the style with the hops and the sour. 5 Stars all day long.

It is also a rather bizarre story when taken at face value. Humanity build a stone Tower to Heaven, which angers the Lord so he destroys it? I’m sorry but, what? Even with the apparent sinful nature of humanity at this stage, Why would the Lord of the world give a damn about a stone tower? There’s no way it could ever reach Heaven, and that he would go to the extra effort to confuse humanity with different languages? for me that makes no sense, its no better than flooding them, which is something the Lord promised he would never do again. It sounds like a bad cover story for a larger more destructive reason.

Speaking of sunshine... we had NONE for the past three days. It was quite possibly the coldest, rainiest, dreariest, windiest May weekend in history. (Well, that I can remember at least.)
If we are to create the life we want, we must look within and understand our early childhood tendencies that stay with us until we learn different behaviour. When we explore how we felt as children, we tend to see patterns present in how we related to our mother and father. Our relationship with our mothers generally shape our patterns towards our inner world, the world of love, nurturing, self-care and sustenance. Our relationship with our father usually sets the stage for our relationship with our career and outer, social life.
But this is a whole different...uh...pot of soup. The deep, rich flavor of roasted butternut squash, the heat of curry and the light, smooth creaminess of coconut milk make for a delicious, silky bisque that is just incredible. With hints of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, my Curried Butternut Squash Bisque is an aromatic and colorful dish that should definitely be on your holiday table!
There is no seriousness in a woman’s thought, according to Nietzsche, and any profundity a man ascribes to her stems from his inability to see past her vain shallowness.[19] Playing perfectly into the cunning woman’s hands, as it frees her from having to indulge in the petty seriousness men are foolish enough to pursue:
How can awareness be raised about the many different forms of assessment that online learning enables? Graham Gibbs has warned against over-innovation – to the extent that students become confused by a proliferation across a programme – since an element of success is related to students familiarity with a mode of assessment.
Let's start this one on Thursday, because it's my wrap up, and I can start it wherever I damned well please...So yeah, Thursday - The Boys had a field trip to the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. I drove my boys, two other boys and another mom. The drive was the usual telling the kids to not yell. Oh, and I'd rented a minivan to transport us all, as my car is out of registration. I'd paid it, but it hasn't yet passed smog testing and I haven't had the funds to have it repaired. The last time I was in the city with a car out of reg, the second I entered Golden Gate Park, I got a $150 ticket. So it actually cost me less to rent a minivan. I will never buy a minivan though, because every noise is funneled to the wedge shaped windshield, and into my ear drum, piercing my brain. I hadn't been to the Academy since my own school days and the improvements are great. The Boys loved it, and made me promise to take them back soon, so maybe a spring break or summer trip? I skipped yoga, with the intent of sleeping in preparation of Friday, and instead had dinner at the restaurant and went to my parents' to tell them what has been going on in my life. I'd been dreading telling them, having been through Sis' divorce and how they handled that. They were very supportive and treated me with respect and like an adult. I was happy with the outcome, but didn't get to bed before midnight.
Whenever Adam is having exams at school, I find it helps to diffuse his stress with treats. I'll spend hours in the kitchen just so that on Monday morning when he walks into school, he will have loads of treats to share with his friends.

My book hasn’t been read widely yet but I have tried out some of the writing on young people and they loved it. They already had quite a lot of knowledge about Iraq, Saddam Hussein and asylum seekers and were certainly interested to learn more through a well told story.
The weather has been nice the last few days (60F yesterday and 55F today) so Jack has been playing in our backyard. He LOVES dogs and cats but last week the dog on the other side of us scared the crap out of him (he barks at EVERYONE when we’re out there). So Jack was out there yesterday and her FOUR! dogs came out. Jack was all excited and Nora was walking across the yard with him so he could see the dogs. I happened to be standing in our patio door (which is on the other side of the yard from hers) and Jack was about 10 feet from the fence when I heard one of the dogs start growling and then the others started barking crazy, jumping at the fence. They’re all little dogs (the biggest is a Border Collie) but Jack is only 2 1/2 feet tall so he was, understandably, scared.

I'd always thought shrews were a type of mouse, but evidently they're more closely related to moles. And like moles they are fiercely territorial, only coming together to mate. They have the greatest ratio of brain to body size of any mammal, including humans - and they need to consume their own body weight in grubs every day. One web site I came across, claimed that if a shrew doesn't eat for two hours it will die (I presume the author means if it goes longer than two hours between meals rather than actually eating for two hours!). And some species have venomous teeth, which no doubt the author of that website would wish me to experience for being so darn pedantic.
After a sweaty night with no AC we went and bought some more train tickets before breakfast, we then checked out of the hotel and went and hired some bikes to do a bit of exploring. For a bargain of 80p we had some functional bikes for the day and pretty abstract map to take us round and I got a free bamboo hat to wear! As we headed out of town, we got a bit lost because the map was terrible but an hour later we arrived in Tam Coc pretty sweaty but with a cool head thanks to my awesome hat. We stopped for a much needed drink and chatted with a retired American guy who had decided to live in Tam Coc, we were a little surprised to hear that very few people seemed to have a grudge against the Americans after what we had seen in the prison the day before. We then cycled to a temple and later a Pagoda through the beautiful paddy fields surrounded by Ha Long bay style mountains coming vertically out from the ground.
Well little guy, you are already two months old! It's strange how at times it seems like it has gone by fast but at other times I feel like you have been in our lives forever. You are growing up so fast and I am trying to soak up every moment of you being this little. I took you to your two month check up today and it appears you are much bigger than the average 2 month old. No surprise there really. You weigh 13 lbs. 9 oz. and are 24 1/2 inches long. Both measurements put you in the 90% my son! Dr. Jim says that you will probably be taller than 6 feet. I'm so glad that you are healthy and growing well.

We sat and talked and ate more fruit and biscotti and drank more wine and sparkling water for a little while and then people began to leave. Chaka was released from wherever she had been during the reading and was petted and attended to by everyone as they chatted and hugged and left. Nick and I gathered up the stuff we had brought, thanked Tom who thanked us, and it was quietly over.
Let’s get started with the ideas... My project is a two page layout. Hope you enjoy it.
Consider this: when you're watching Who Do You Think You Are?, have you ever thought they've made the research look too easy? Have you ever thought, hey, the celebrity didn't seem very excited (I recall someone saying this after the recent Tim McGraw episode)? Well, what if the scenario were this:
I am going to try those paper fortune cookies too.
Then I take that number, I write it on a piece of paper and I flush it down the toilet. Because all I really need to consider is the nickname of each team, and how that character would perform against its opponent in a real-world fight. So the sharks always beat the tuna, the leopards always defeat the wildebeests, and any dogs beat any cats, any cats beat any birds, and any birds beat any worms or insects (which explains why there’s no such thing as the San Antonio Silverfish or the Minneapolis Mealworms, except maybe in the Arena Football League).
I was an aspiring writer and poet myself. The brief venture into acting was a mistake, I saw that by then. But the work in the museum was a mistake, too. I was ill fit to type anything (no training, no patience, no precision) and was ill suited for 9-5 job (if I arrived to work before Noon, it was a lucky day for Museum).
Sloan, 5, and Jackson, 10, have stylish spaces with lots of special details to call their own. Sugarplum, 38, overhauled the bedrooms with the future and a budget in mind, and she gave the children lots of opportunities to get involved and personalize their rooms.
I said, "Treats?" And she forgot all about getting dry. When I put down her supper, she ate before going back to the job of drying herself. I caught her again in the towel, which didn't make her too happy, but neither was she too upset as I rubbed her off a bit more. When I scratched her (damp) back, she sat there and purred.

“On the way down the mountain, I stop outside Old Sonam’s yard in the upper village. In sooty rags and rough-spun boots, wearing the coral-colored beads of her lost girlhood, Sonam is sitting legs straight out in the dry dung, weaving a blanket on a crazy handloom rigged to rocks and sticks, bracing the whole with old twine soles pushed stiff against a stone. Her wool has a handsome and delicate pattern, for there is design in the eye of this old wild one. I admire her sudden grin, strong back, and grimy hide indifferent to the cold.
The world’s poorest billion people earn less than £1 per day (£360 per year) and the next poorest two billion earn less than £2 (£720) so the total income for the poorest half of the world’s population is £1,800 billion per year – just over half our nation’s debt.

Excited to proclaim not much has changed at the Dragon. I dropped in for meet the brewer night and it was pleasantly familiar. After a nice glass of Fort George North II (which the mug club was still in effect), the happy hour hasn't changed yet. Next up was a glass of Baron Rauchbier which was excellent. There is something about a easy to drink smoked beer that is just perfect. You get the heavier smoked/scotch flavors, without to much kick.

A few seconds later, and out came Tyler, into his daddy's hands, 12.48am - maybe twenty minutes since my waters broke. He had been moving himself, rotating his shoulders and turning in the birth canal, and I felt every single part of that journey. My husband passed him to me, through my legs, and I held him to my chest. My perfect baby. My perfect birth.
The word dimension derives from the latin word “dimenso”, human beings are allocated in what is known as the 3rd dimension out of the 26 that known to exist in our universe. The reason being for this is because of our ability to predominately perceive objects in 3D.

They did not wait long. Real steamrollered Athletic. After 11 minutes Ronaldo had the chance from the penalty spot to score his 44th league goal of the season. He chose the dinked shot and Gorka Iraizoz went to ground but the goalkeeper still had time to react and sto p it with his leg.

Mobile homes offer a fantastic option to the high price of housing in the USA. Mobile and manufactured homes are usually a great starting place for home ownership. A stepping stone to a condo or small home. As long as they are kept in good repair, these homes will last a long time. There are millions of homes still being used that were built over 30 and 40 years ago.
Which was fine with Kathryn. As hostess, there was much still to do, and some important details she couldn’t leave to the staff. She would come later. With a strangled cry, he thrust one final time, and she tasted him as the milky stream hit the back of her throat. Without losing a single drop, she drank him all in.

The final thought for this week on this passage is that David thinks of Saul in terms of his office and honors him in this light. We see this matter of honor mentioned in Philippians 4:8: “. . . whatever is honorable. . . .” But this principle is taught in a number of other contexts as well:
I'm still trying to understand 1. how he managed to get the poop to spray up and back like that, and 2. how Rich could go in and check Noah's poop (we require visual evidence at this point if he doesn't want to face down another enema) and completely ignore the shit spray.

It was so hard to muster energy for anything productive. My eating and exercise suffered.
This is something many in the Down syndrome community have pondered before me and will ponder after I'm done pondering.

But I've realized that it's not enough. I can love someone beyond reason, and even if he somehow, someday, somewhere, returned the favour, it wouldn't be enough. I understand now, how and why people can walk away even from those they love dearly. It is strange to never have had much at all but to realize that you need so, so much more.

A traveling exhibit known as Van Gogh Alive, tells the story of Vincent Van Gogh’s life through the chronicle of his paintings.

Sunlight blazed off the high, white clouds. Pevan resisted the urge to reach out for them, instead shielding her eyes and peering sunward.

Of course these four tastes work in harmony and the reason why sweet tastes so good is that it’s all a fine balancing act. For example, good chocolate has both acidic and bitter notes. We’re just not used to attributing those undertones to something “sweet.”
I really struggle with buttercream, it tends to split very easily for me. I love cream cheese icing because it is just as decadent but so so much easier to make. This recipe is based on the Jamie Oliver recipe that goes with his carrot cake.

Question for committee: "We know three innocent men were prosecuted for a crime that never took place.

The characters in the Galahad series are far from perfect, and that's obvious right away. But they're also sharp, talented teens who are bold and curious, and willing to take on the biggest challenge in human history. I loved the idea of discovering how teenaged characters would learn to rely on themselves and each other in order to overcome catastrophe.

It is my job, though, to help them develop rudders. To learn to navigate the seas of life, and that although they cannot control the weather, or the sea, they can learn to sail their vessel well. Somehow, I missed this lesson in my teens. Growing up in a somewhat authoritarian home, I had little say in many things, and questioning my dad at the helm was considered disrespectful. And if I am truthful, life as a cork can be appealing at times. There is a lot of responsibility in owning your decisions, and their consequences.
In a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson sent Sunday, Al Armendariz says he regrets his words and stresses that they do not reflect his work as administrator of the five-state region including Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Armendariz, who holds a doctorate in environmental engineering, apologized last week for his remarks. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, told The Associated Press that Armendariz has since received death threats. His resignation was effective Monday, when he informed his senior staff.

But it seems to me that I ought to be able to recreate that for myself, an interior space that can be summoned up when the voices of reality become too loud and insistent, when the work demands quiet, to allow those other fictional voices to make themselves heard. It doesn't matter how. Walking, exercise, music, daydreaming, gardening. Whatever it takes. The rituals might change from one person to another, or even with the passage of time. But they matter because the ability to touch silence matters in the life of a writer.
LESSON 7. Square foot gardening & pots. Square foot gardening sounds great, but I haven’t managed it here because almost nothing grows where I want it to. However, using pots it kind of similar – you fit the pot size to the plant(s), although you may start small and repot as the plant grows. And I can move pots to try to find the position the plants like, and as the sun’s path changes during the year I can also move the plants appropriately.
The man said, “Let me go; it’s daybreak.” Jacob said, “I’m not letting you go ’til you bless me.” The man said, “What’s your name?” He answered, “Jacob.”
Whereas the first half was all about floaty maidens with circlets, beautiful hair and slender arms picked out attractively by backlighting, the second half briefly became The Middle Eastern Baebes, which reminded me a bit of the incidental music of Gladiator and probably produced a collective belly dancing fantasy in the audience. It then returned to a nice bit of chanting about the circle of life in time to send us out to the pub feeling all winter solstice-y.
We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico.

These photos are back in our garden again, the bike looks great now and certainly makes people smile as we bike past them. Mind you they may be smiling as my socks are tucked into my trousers and Mr Sweetpea and I are giggling away whilst peddling around the village on it - this bike just makes you have a huge grin on your face :-) I still have to master starting off without wobbling around on the back for a few seconds and Mr Sweetpea telling me to stay still but I am sure that will come with time.

Bitter Child has little to do with experiences from my life and more to do with the tragedy in the lives of many people, especially women, who are in a relationship that leads to the birth of a child. Specifically, this poem is about the birth of an unwanted child and the helplessness and bitterness that define the flavor of the woman’s heart and, symbolically, her milk.
Patients getting emergency department services, observation services, outpatient surgery, lab tests or X-rays, but for whom the doctor hasn't written an order of admission, are considered outpatients even if they spend the night. Even if you stay in the hospital for a few days, don't assume you have been admitted. Ask about your status!
Syracuse DE/OLB Chandler Jones has seen his stock rise as scouts have gone back to the game tapes. I think he has a lot of Shaun Phillips’ qualities but he’s not nearly as fast out the gate, which is huge. It doesn’t hurt that his big brothers are UFC light-heavyweight champ Jon “Bones” Jones and Baltimore Raven DL Arthur Jones. Bloodlines help but they don’t guarantee success (ask Casey Matthews). Still, I think he can be a good player; I’m just not overly-excited about him.
What men and women think of this represenation and how do they act? It is known that television is an influential means of communication and the decay of Italian television I think it is particularly relevant nowadays in the way women act and even think.
Gosh, I feel more relaxed just reading that!
So after 18 months of being afraid, I have finally got my night walks back, all thanks to Archie. When the children are relatively settled and the kitchen is tidy, Archie and I slip out the front door, leaving Daddy in charge. We only ever walk for half an hour, but it's enough to shake his sillies out and to find my mojo again.
That's the overall framework. To turn this into a story though, we need to add a few layers, things like plans and reactions and revised plans, and each plan should create a new opposing factor which will add a new complication. (For a complication worksheet, see here.) This creates a recursive chain:
Lightly grease cookie sheet. Stir together flour, walnuts, cinnamon, and lemon peel. Beat granulated sugar and butter in large bowl on medium speed until creamy. Beat in egg and vanilla until fluffy. Gradually stir in flour mixture. Shape dough into 1 inch balls. Place 2 inches apart on cookie sheet. Press thumb in center of each to make indentation. Fill each indentation with 1/2 t jam.
KK: The added level of security we receive through an audit helps ensure that we are maximizing our investments and minimizing waste. By incorporating Sunday Select into the reports, the transparency enables us to pick and choose where we want the added coverage and where we do not. While most Sunday Select-type products are built using very similar rules and strategies, there are some that are more desirable than others. Having them audited and incorporated into the ABC reports adds a level of confidence and ensures consistency market to market.

I am rapidly becoming a sniveling, snorting Patrick Ness fan-girl. (Maybe that should be “fan-granny.”) When I gushed about his Chaos Walking series a while ago, I noted what I thought were some flaws with the third book in the trilogy. This latest book, in my opinion, is perfect, and I don’t use that word lightly. It’s shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal in England and I so desperately want it to win.
If Eve and her daughters gave birth like the planets, two at a time, one male and one female, and they were exceedingly long lived and always fertile, never entering into menopause, each one of these females may have produced a vast posterity. Just using an imaginary number and saying that Eve was able to give birth 1000 consecutive times, once every 10 months, during a period of 833 years, and supposing that she gave birth to twins each time, a son and a daughter, this would mean that she gave birth to 2000 children, of which 1000 were daughters. Those 1000 daughters, doing the same as her, would each give birth to 1000 daughters. This would give Eve 1000 daughters and 1,000,000 grand-daughters. And so on and so forth: 1 billion great grand-daughters, 1 trillion great great grand-daughters, etc. Obviously, these are just imaginary numbers, not taking into account premature deaths, etc.

From infancy, our culture teaches what it means to be a boy or a girl. From the colour of clothes to the toys we play with, the messages begin at a very early age. Young people are influenced by a barrage of messages to conform to a variety of expectations, to buy this widget, and to preserve a rigid set of values that stress the differences between genders. The world of make believe as it is presented on TV and in the movies - from thriller films to soap operas on television - has a big effect on the viewer. Even though the plot and characters are fictitious, the underlying attitudes and messages are not. They communicate cultural values, which shape the way we think and the way we interact. Understanding this, it is important to begin to unmask a double standard that is pervasive in our culture. The dichotomy is that we buy into the stereotypes that reinforce abuse, while trying to “root out” violence in our community.
Construction of the present palace began in 1645 under the fifth Dalai Lama, Lobsang Gyatso, an important figure in Tibetan history. Known as the "Great Fifth," he unified Tibet and made the Yellow Hat sect the state religion. The White Palace was completed in 1648, after which it was used as winter quarters by the Dalai Lama.

This is the time of year where I question my obsession. I don’t question it mid-season because why would you? It’s mid-season. That’s a given. Better off questioning the color of the sky or why velociraptors had to die off. One positive thing about my particular obsession is that the related joy or despair are good enough in of themselves: they need no introduction, require nothing in the way of justification and are entirely whole without any need for psychoanalysis, parental approval or any of the sloppy solipsistic reasoning that shoot wholly unmemorable articles to the top of time.com or newsweek.com’s most popular articles. I don’t need a news magazine to tell me my particular obsession is healthy or unhealthy or simply unavoidable. In this the season is pure: it just is. A 2-1 start can become a 12-1 season (see: last year) and any deeper emotional analysis between games one and thirteen are the equivalent of mental masturbation, i.e. entertaining and good enough for a couple of hours whiled away, but nothing of import has been accomplished.

William pushed himself to his feet, and stumbled into the dark opening. Unable to see, he fumbled within his pants pocket and retrieved a metal square. With his thumb, he flipped open the top then struck the wheel, hoping for a spark. The lighter stayed dark. He shook the lighter vigorously then struck the wheel again. It sparked and caught fire. The small orange glow illuminated the tight cave. William licked his parched lips, and descended down.

There is also a scripture reference for each hymn. I will then use the scripture reference to prepare a study over the scripture and truths from the hymn. Our study will always be taken back to the Bible.
This bit of counter is the first thing you see as you come in the front door, when you look all the way to the back of the house.

First let me say, thank you so much for letting me visit your blog, Laura. I write Christian Fiction, because I believe God gave me the talent to write. Writing takes me places I'll probably never go. Words carry so much weight and I want to touch people with the truth.

There’s nothing worse than foundation marked necklines or fake-tanned corset bones. By all means wear some make-up, just don’t wear enough that some migrates from your face onto my gowns.

And it illustrates what seems to be a growing trend in modern baseball coverage. In the last few years, but especially this spring, national baseball prognosticators have seemingly fallen head over heels in love with certain teams and players, starstruck like a pack of teenage girls gone gaga over the latest celebrity mega-hunk. And like those young gals, they’d much rather focus on what’s drool-inducing about these players than on the stark truths about their faults. The stories are enticing and romantic, but

Of course, this is assuming that Apple will once again add a number to the end of the next iPhone, but they may not. They dropped the number from the newest iPad, and they may continue this trend with the iPhone line, but otherwise the phone will probably be the iPhone 6.

These white residents saw treaty rights as “special privileges” given to the Ojibwe, rather than ways of life the government agreed to let tribes continue after taking swaths of their land. For several years, an Ojibwe fisherman or woman couldn’t get in their boat without violent rhetoric and sometimes physical objects being hurled at them. Eventually, when the public realized the decision was there to stay, they had no choice but to go home, and the Ojibwe just kept on fishing perhaps a little more proud of their traditions and the struggle to hold onto them.

Heat the olive oil in a large pot or dutch oven. Add onion and garlic. Cook until soft and translucent but not brown in color, about 3 to 5 minutes. Then turn the heat on high and mix in the tomatoes, tomato paste, peppers, cilantro, cumin, and paprika. Sauté the mixture for a minute or 2, and add the chicken stock. Bring mixture to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for about 30 to 40 minutes.

Dispersing with most of the Gothicism the series had hitherto become known for (even Batman Forever), Batman & Robin is a brightly coloured neon-lit headache of a movie. It kicks off with Mr. Freeze relieving a museum of its valuable diamonds. Which is a lovely old fashioned plot, actually. Not enough Bat-villains these days are into the whole stealing things these days. They just want to watch the world burn. Well, Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze is very old fashioned, all stupid puns ("ice to see you" and "stay cool") and rocketships which shoot off into the atmosphere. But Batman and Robin can't stop arguing for long enough to stop him. "This," says Batman, "is why Superman works alone." If this is what a functional DC Universe would have looked like, I am in no doubt that the Superman of which Batman speaks is the Nicolas Cage version:

My website has been down for a two days now. Well, let me rephrase. My website is up, but there is no info on it because the design was never transferred to my new server. I never received the email with the questionnaire. In frustration, I contact them today, telling them my site is down, and I need them to transfer my files, that they should have sent this email right after I made my payment since I had a customer service rep I was talking to at that very moment. The new rep responded rudely in a public live chat “SARAH do NOT blame us for your site being down, it is YOUR fault, not ours! We are doing EXACTLY what we are supposed to be doing!” Wow. Really?? I am taken aback. I will be so very happy when my site transfers over and I don’t have to deal with these people anymore. Moral of the story? Don’t host with BLUdomain. They suck.

We were doing the most basic stunt where I was sitting on my friend's shoulders. The camp leaders taught us some Very Complex and Scientific Way involving geometry and physics and just a touch of rocket science of dismounting this "stunt." It was absurd and ridiculous and also? Absurd. And I lost it. I started laughing like whoa. And then I needed to pee like WHOA. And all I wanted to do was get off my friend's shoulders so I could run to the bathroom.

The plot thickens and faith is tested as they find that they have gotten themselves involved in something much more complicated than simply the arrival of a centuries-old vampire: he is in league with gods of the Egyptian pantheon, who want the Archangel Gabriel's trumpet, and a powerful warlock with a demon lover who has the ability to travel between celestial realms. Deep secrets are unveiled and Sarah becomes attuned to her faith in ways she never knew possible, and with the help of her father, she uses what she's learned to help her friends in the battle they are now desperate to fight. The stakes have become very high, and Sarah's dreams are becoming more and more disturbing. Will they be able to stop the forces they have pitted themselves against? Are they even ready to pay what it might cost them to win?
