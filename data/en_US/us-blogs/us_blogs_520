And as for those who believe legacy publishing is less work than self-publishing, you need to go back to 2005 and read my blog. I worked much harder as a legacy published author than I do as a self-pubbed author. I also make a much better living now than I did then.
I had my list of wants which wasn't too large, top of the list was the afore mentioned Fall single, closely followed by the Sweet Jane 7", also the Raveonettes double pack and Rosebud by the Jezabels and I said to myself if I got those then I would be happy. I did have other things like The Slow Club lp but at twenty quid, it was a bit steep and a few other 7" which would have been nice to have.
Mdluli has since been reinstated to head the CID where he is in charge of the police’s slush fund, but Mkhwanazi told MPs on Wednesday that he was still the subject of a departmental enquiry. To date, no explanation has been given for the decision to reinstate Mdluli.
Boy, you two are sure busy responding to one another! I haven’t seen any comments from anyone else, though. You’re having your own private little hatefest. I have no problem with Star Trek or any other science fiction. I enjoy it, actually! What I don’t care for are the lies and misrepresentations you write about your sister. I don’t care for the bullying and harassment over everything she tries to do personally or professionally. When you can show me your credentials in social work, then talk to me. I’ve seen your sister’s. The only thing she’s trying to do is to bring an adoptee’s perspective to the original post and this one. Why are you here other than to stalk her? How is it you seem to know so many of her screen names if you’re not stalking her? The fact you found a new screen name she uses just confirms the fact you’re stalkers. The fact that she can’t remain anonymous when trying to address adoption issues and not you personally or by name is due to your rather bizarre fixation with your hate for her

Her idea of bloggers and real people having an innate populist talent for creating well designed and beautifully decorated spaces jibed with my own feelings. She also included personal back stories about each home she chose to photograph and write about, and this makes the book have depth. And that she traveled to each location, and each home, and got to know each space, each town or city, and each home owner, this certainly adds another layer of personality and richness."
The most recent one I've read is about David Andrews. His mother asked the coach if her son could be a part of the team, but never expected him to even practice with the team. He started practicing with them and they realized he was good. He could shoot. He shoots 40% from the three-point line.
On arrival at Burridge’s gravel car-park I could see manager, Paul Dyke, and club chairman, Barrie Becheley, talking with one another on the pitch. It was reminiscent of Roman Abramovich’s recent and well publicised visit to Andre Villas Boas, at Chelsea’s training ground. Not that Barrie was not here to question Paul on recent results. Nor was he here to find out why he cannot pry centre-half, Ryan Hurst and midfielder, Daniel Esfandiari away from work on Saturday afternoons. He was here for more practical reasons, to give Paul a black tool bag filled with a new set of steel pegs and Velcro ties for the goal nets.
The only things that went against the enjoyment factor was that the book ends on a massive cliffhanger and combined with the expectation of things to come, that makes the wait for the next book hard. The second point would be that the book also has revelations that gives answers but further creates questions that will leave the readers perplexed. But both these issues are minor ones and wouldn’t affect the overall reading experience.

What usually ends up happening is that I completely wear myself out. Thinking that I've earned it, I give myself permission to slack off for a while and recover. Since I've exceeded my capacity for responsibility in such a dramatic fashion, I end up needing to take more recovery time than usual. This is when the guilt-spiral starts.
As Secretary Clinton travels to Beijing, the moral credibility of the United States on the world stage hangs in the balance. Chen Guangcheng is the Gandhi of our time. He is a man of inconceivable bravery. Poor, blind, beaten and detained, he nevertheless possesses the surpassing backbone to stand alone against the crushing brutality of the communist regime. He is the “Tank Man” against the One Child Policy. He has done this on behalf of the women of China, who for 32 years have suffered the unspeakable torture of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization at the hands of the barbarous Chinese population control machine. Chen Guangcheng is a warrior for women’s rights.

Background: T. messaged me via a paid internet dating site. His photos were an example of what Mr. Darcy’s Camisole has termed “scenario b” – they weren’t artistic per se, but were just kind of blurry and weird so it was hard to tell in any concrete way what he actually looked like. However, his profile said that he had formerly toured as a professional classical pianist and that he was now in law school, which was a sufficiently intriguing combination.

I've gone a clean and simple design and used the fabulous Medallion stamp from Stampin' Up! - it hasn't seen ink for a while, but I thought it would look great in these colours. I stamped it directly onto the card in pink, then stamped it again on white card in orange and yellow. I cut the central sections out using my Spellbinder dies, adding a pink gem to finish it off. On the opposite corner, I stamped a "bit" of the medallion in yellow and then, using my stamp-a-ma-jig, stamped the sentiment.

I spent around $14 on supplies. I wound up needing slightly more than 1 skein of yarn as I used a 10" wreath form, not an 8" wreath form as the tutorial suggested. So, I have almost a full skein of the fuzzy green yarn left for another project, along with most of the ribbon, and a good portion of the fake flowers. I would say I used only $8-$10 worth of supplies. Not too shabby for a cheery touch of spring!

Instead, if you have suggestions for your husband, have patience. Talk to him, but don’t get frustrated and fight.

I wanted to create a very natural "earthy" look for Ardella, so I chose to not add any glitter to her wings. The veining in her wings was created by lightly drawing the lines in with YG95. I then coloured the wings in sections beginning with a base coat of G20 followed by YG91, YG95 and G99. I used the veins as a guideline for where I wanted shadows and highlights to fall to create some dimension. Although I used the same greens that were used for her dress, I wanted the wings to have a slightly different tone so I went over them with some browns in the E40 range. The addition of these browns toned down the intensity of the greens. For the very deepest shadows, I added some C10. (applied sparingly with tip-to-tip blending)

Yes, it’s true that watching pornography is a form of objectification. But it seems to me that the people who argue against pornography don’t have a very high opinion of those who are doing the objectifying. Surely, if I look at a picture of a naked woman and think sexual thoughts, that doesn’t mean that, as a result of that picture, I’ll have sexual thoughts about all women, right?

So the question is this: what would it be like to suspend the belief that there is a great being that lives in Heaven who is charge of everything? Because, isn’t it true that people wish for a God to exist so we won’t have to do the required heavy lifting here? And isn’t Heaven just a wish to escape Hell on Earth? Take that all away and you’re just here with yourself, and responsible. Doesn’t that sound like a better way to live? It sure would help clean up this mess we have here in the world.

After that, did we even notice the meal? Yes we did, though when the waitress came back and asked us what we wanted, we said, we're here for the Supper...she said, You'll split that, then? That seemed odd, but we figured she knew what she was talking about, and did she ever: the 'supper' came on one big plate, and it was a great pile of stuff! A man at the next table also got it, just for himself (his date got the tartufo pizza), and my hat's off to him, Diary: he finished it and mopped up the gravy! The sirloin was tasty and tender in a crackling coating of crisp breading, the gravy was smoky and flavorful, the grits were dense and delicious, the spinach was silky. The only disappointment was the biscuit; just barely warm, a bit tough, and for being called "sharp cheddar," it didn't really come through on the cheesiness. Still, 4 out of 5, Diary! I had a Southampton Burton Pale Ale with dinner, and it was quite nice, flavorful but not intrusive, and a good beer with the food.

MCLM still represents 3rd Force as it is supportive of neither old school camps, unfortunately RPK has mishandled what could be his peer – Anwar by for no apparent good reason (I’d say Anwar was too arrogant to meet RPK or somesuch, I had the same closed clique attitude from Pakatan too while indirectly showing interest for membership) supporting section 377B and effectively condemning private sexual freedoms of hetero and non-hetero comples married or unmarried.

In Canada, Shoppers Drug Mart (SDM) is a drug store that usually sells everything quite overpriced, in comparison to prices at Walmart and at grocery stores. The only consolation is that when they have sales, the price usually drops to below that of competitors. An additional perk is the opportunity to collect Optimum points for almost every dollar spent. Some purchases will give you extra points, depending on the weekly deal. Once in a while, you have the opportunity to earn 20 times the number of points if you spend over a certain amount – usually $50-75 CAD. Along with gift with purchases, the deals can become pretty hard to resist. You can collect points with an Optimum card, which you can get for free. You can earn additional points if you have an Optimum MasterCard for purchases outside of SDM as well Optimum points can be redeemed for merchandise value. After a recent 20x points event, I had enough points to redeem $85 CAD worth of merchandise from SDM.
Somehow, these all remind me of Dr. Evil’s minion laughing with him:

He so loved his Sister, Margaret. He knew Margaret was special…full of light and life and love. He knew he was blessed to be her brother. Jack never teased Margaret like other brothers do- he never took his little Sister for granted. He was Margaret’s partner, her playmate, her best friend, her protector and her comforter. She was all of these things to him, too. Margaret’s loss is immeasurable.
When I got the award for being the best trainer in the team, as I said it was a significant moment in my life. I got praise given to me by someone I respected, someone that was important. It was praise from someone who people wanted praise from. In much of our lives we are seeking, in fact, for this type of praise. We’re seeking affirmation that our lives, that what we’ve done with our lives, has gained the respect and praise of someone.

Over dinner at downtown Portland's Clyde Common in 2010, Grenier and former Nike designer Justin Hawkins got to talking about flat top beer cans, the metal cans your dad would open by puncturing two holes in the top with a steel opener called a churchkey.

I can think of only one reason why they are over here: it’s because we are not over there. The recession, combined with tourists’ fear of ‘unstable’ Arab countries, has left them bereft of customers so they have resorted to bringing their slippers, rugs, bags and trinkets to us. It’s a pity they didn’t bring some of their food as well.
Moreover, I like being treated like a intelligent human being, too, and not a dumb chick. It's so worth schlepping to a garage 15 miles from home to get that kind of service. I don't know much about car repair—but I am not completely ignorant of the working of a car (I've had jobs in the past fixing rather large machines.. and have a good understanding of mechanics) –I impressed a cousin a few years ago (he is an automotive engineer) by just knowing the basics of internal combustion--(intake, compression, explosion, exhaust)--Though why he ever thought I wouldn't have at least a basic (theoretical, rather than practical) understanding of cars is well, boggling.
Well, this is a small sample. Surely the policies of the free-market Republicans means that soon there will be scores of other health insurance companies chomping at the bit to get this man's business!

Watching horror movies when I was younger was, by society's standards, a transgression. It was something you watched at a sleepover that was going to scare you and even though your parents told you not to, but you still did it. Horror movies were something you whispered about, stole glances of the VHS covers and told your friends about when you wanted to scare them. So what's scarier than a horror movie where the line between fictional and real begins to blur?
I'm beat, so here's the conclusion in a nutshell: Once we had figured out the function of the space, the main pieces we needed and then the inspiration fabric, I have been able to sort of build a master plan. After deciding on the floral pattern, I knew I wanted a striped rug. From that, I knew it made the most sense to do a solid color on the curtains. The next step is reupholstering the arm chairs in a small scale print and making a skirt for the tv console with a more organic/flowy pattern, like an ikat. The next layer will be the smaller stuff: reupholstering and painting the rope benches, pillows for the chairs and the gray sofa, lamp shade changes, throws, accessories, etc. I'm not really even thinking about what I'll do for that layer until I get there and can see what colors and pattern scale I'm lacking in the room.

James O. Brown, best known to local poetry aficionados as The P.O.E., had already established himself in the GTA poetry slam scene before National Poetry Month 2012 rolled around.

@@@ I’ve always thought Regina Spektor was more hype than substance so I was surprised by this single off her upcoming album. Her vocal performance on this tune is really stylish. Her phrasing has some bounce to it and she’s sounds looser than on previous outings. The arrangement is also pretty hip.
Initiative is a simple matter for me. Group initiative and then I take in dex modifiers after. If the initiative monkey rolls a 3 and someone has a dex mod of +2 then they go one segment 1.

We followed the instructions inside my "passport" and made a bee-line for the info desk and I urged Pri to tell them she had the key to the city. She did so, shyly, and we were pointed towards the back where a group was already hovering around a man with a beautiful (but lock-less, sad, no actual key-turning here) music box. Buried inside were tags allowing us free entry inside the museum. There were only a couple left after we grabbed ours and as this was the Met's last day participating in the project, I was glad we had braved the wee hours of Sunday morning to ensure another key adventure!

The American writer Henry James lived here from 1898 until 1916. In the typically square Georgian hallway a whole wall is taken up with photographs of famous literary friends. I was pleased to come across a photograph of the young Virginia Stephen, later to become Virginia Woolf. Henry James was an old family friend of Leslie and Julia Stephen and a regular visitor at Virginia's childhood homes at Hyde Park Gate in London and Talland House in St Ives.

Some writers aim to keep their dialogue as realistic as possible, using pauses and dialogue which mimics real speech, almost like a script but this, like everything in writing, has its ups and downs. While it is good to try to write natural-sounding dialogue, fiction is not real life and the purpose of dialogue in a sceneis usually very specific. The trick is to try and balance this. Too realistic can include too much while too contrived can reduce the overall effect of your scene.
Universities need to standardize their graduate grading systems. University administrators need to request individual schools and programs to adopt the same grading system for graduate students. Grades may not be important for some firms, ie. universities looking to fill academic seats; however, most companies would like a graduate student's grades to reflect that individual's abilities and work ethic. It is difficult for a corporation to put any faith in this variable when post-graduate scoring systems vary widely between programs within a particular school, much less between graduate schools within a university (or between universities). For the same reasons that researchers use standardized measures assay an issue, businesses would like to universities to use a standard grading system for all graduate students.

There is, of course, another possibility, another piece of Borges-style magic. Bolaño has created an alternate literary universe, one peopled by obsessives, cranks and literary mediocrities. Goebbels once lamented that National Socialism seemed incapable of creating great art. What he did not understand, what he could not understand, was that such a thing was impossible, because great works of art can only be created by minds that are free to roam without restriction. In the Goebbels universe the only art that could exist is that of the oddities who populate the pages of Nazi Literature in the Americas.

Leave to prove in its tin for another hour, covered in a tea towel. Near the end of the second proving time, preheat your oven to gas mark 7. Just before you’re ready to pop it in the oven, sprinkle the focaccia generously with sea salt (I use Saxa), chopped rosemary and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.
I have found no more of John F. Watt's work after that date, but there is every chance that there is a great deal yet to discover... this outline dips into a writing career that lasted over thirty years and at least 57 novels. I hope someone out there will be able to let us know more about this fascinating author.
I am a Carolina girl who married her high school sweetheart in 2010!
It turns out that a future criminal with the improbable name of Frand Mattar had sent a bomb back in time to Central City in 1966, which would explode if a high-speed wave hit it; Mattar had a trigger that would cause this to happen and was blackmailing the authorities to force them to allow him to loot at will. Of course, there was another thing that could cause the bomb to go off; if the Flash traveled at super-speed. Thus the "chronal officer" had hypnotized Barry to make him believe that nobody in Central City appreciated his efforts, so that he would resign.
...I think Thomas Edison installed it.
May I say this concerning those who want a voice or the like? They have no faith. They do not believe. They want to walk by sight, not by faith which is absolutely contrary to the will of God in 2 Corinthians 5:7. “For we walk by faith, not by sight.”
Two things today-- and update (Ooo! Also a U word!) and something useful.
The Duchess wasn't perfect. I'd accidentally scorched the dead center of that quilt when attaching hot fix crystals (you can see this in the close up image above), but the first judge didn't even see the mistake. It was good to learn that judges won't see every mistake because they don't know where to look!
I watched the news this morning. Big mistake. There was a fire in a townhouse complex in Webster, TX, a small town close to the Johnson Space Center. A woman lived there with her 4 children. She was able to get out with one child. Firemen rescued another. 2 died in the fire. She and the firemen tried to get them out but the flames were too intense. They had pictures of the two children - a lovely 12 year old girl and a 9 year old boy. All of the bystanders including the mother could hear them screaming for help. How do you get past something like that as a parent?
doesn’t that make us feel a little bit

May 6 - we took the parentals to Berrima in the Southern Highlands. Dad's great-great-great grandmother testified against her rapist (a not-so-charming bushranger by the name of Paddy Curran) in court, and he was the first man hanged at Berrima Gaol in 1841 or something. So we went on a little pilgrimage, although it wasn't a family history session or anything. We had a lovely day. The sun was shining, the pies were plentiful and there's a patchwork store so mum and I were very happy.

I won't keep you in suspense any longer. For the song we believe best sums up the emotional devastation left in the aftermath of a failed relationship - all to a good beat - the winner is (drumroll please) Carrie Talick.

So, as is my habit, I go online and check the daily news. And I'm hit right between the eyes by these stories -- these all too typical examples of the way America is changing (coming apart at the seams). All this in just one unremarkable day (keep in mind that this kind of "unravelling" goes on almost every day):
I have been very busy working on something I am soooooooo excited about!!!! I am still crafting and loving it, and I am taking it to new heights! Almost a year ago, I knew that I wanted to make art that would be very sentimental to others. I had made a shadow box for a friend and the way it touched them just warmed my heart. I knew that I needed to take my talents in papercrafting and offer it to others. As some of you may know, I work full-time at a fortune 500 company and while I enjoy the work I do for this company, I don't get the sense of community that I get through papercrafting. So, my solution.....
Militant Islamic organizations and other hostile outsiders keep bragging about how they are going to colonize and conquer Western countries. They must be amazed by the near-total lack of resistance they face. One of the main reasons for this is that a heavily biased press of Globalists and Multiculturalists, who daily feed the masses a deeply distorted image of reality, where problems are the result of white racism and xenophobia.

You might be tempted to compare the sale of the “Winterwood” mansion in Adare with the sale of Updown Court, “Britains Most Expensive House” to which NAMA appointed receivers this week. Set on 58 acres, the 50,000-sq ft, 24-bedroom pile has five swimming pools, stables, tennis and squash courts, a bowling alley, a helipad and garage space for eight cars. The property is in Surrey, about 30 miles from central London. The property has its own website here and its owner, developer Leslie Allen-Vercoe had been trying to flog it for six years before NAMA appointed CB Richard Ellis as receivers. It is not known how much NAMA want for the property but reporting has suggested that NAMA paid just GBP 20m (€23m) for the loan underpinning it, and given NAMA’s core objective of recouping its purchase price there is reason to suppose the price will be in that region.

So it is that the Germans are again cutting subsidies, this time by a further 30 percent, in a plan which, according to David Wedepohl, spokesman for the German Solar Industry Association, " amounts to nothing less than a solar phase-out law".

Because we all need to remember the little awesome things in our lives, here's the blog 1000 Awesome Things. It was started by Neil Pasricha at a time when his best friend had taken his own life and his marriage was falling apart. It was a great idea and now the blog is not one book, but two.
This week's workouts were dismal. Dismal, I say! There was one bright spot on Wednesday when I got out for my very first bike ride since el baby-o was born.
I always managed to work the whole "the customer is not always right" to my advantage whenever I worked behind the bar. Granted, only the most awful customers would ever experience the wrath of my "the customer is not always right" bartender attitude. Nice customers always received my best customer service. I was always considered one of the nicer bartenders behind the bar at the club I worked at. As glamorous and fun as bartending in a strip club may seem, if you work behind the bar long enough in one of those places, it eventually starts to eat at your soul and make you bitter. The bitterness eventually comes out in the form of a "take no shit" attitude towards the customers.
This entire year has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. I made a giant leap and moved to Vegas. I've moved out of my parent's house twice before and failed both time. When things got hard, I'd just give up.

2012 was a crazy year…and album, that’s how hip-hop heads worldwide will remember it. Following in the footsteps of great DJ/Producer and MC duos like Eric B. & Rakim and Gang Starr, Statik Selektah & Termanology once again combine to form the powerhouse group 1982. The formula is perfected and flawless as Statik crafts the perfect sonic landscapes for Term’s more mature and sophisticated delivery; listen to the new single “Up Every Night.”
As their numbers grow, they are aided by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. La Raza, another anti-American Mexican organization, works directly for the overthrow of America. It reaches into the highest levels of our government starting with Alberto Gonzalez. US House of Representative Joe Baca of California supports La Raza. What does La Raza mean? "For the Latino race, everything, everyone outside the race, nothing!" LULAC is another group that supports the ‘Reconquista of Aztlan,’ or, the retaking of the American Southwest back into Mexico. Notice that Mexican president Fox dictates to our leaders what they will do with his 10 million illegal immigrants in our country. Notice 46 Mexican consulates in our cities around America supporting his people in our country. Notice voter fraud by illegal aliens now able to throw our local and national elections.
It’s not surprising if some lines feel culturally unacceptable now in a book that was first published in 1938, but it seems a real shame someone didn’t edit them out, because the substance of what the author has to say is timeless, thoughtful and inspiring.
The initial commitment is for 5-10 hours per week, with a strong likelihood of this increasing as the studio continues to grow. Hours are flexible and after an initial training period, much of the work can be done remotely. Pay is $10/hour or $15/hour in barter for classes, treatments and studio use. A combination of pay and barter is possible.
Parenting is still something we learn on-the-job, but most of us today don’t start learning it until we have a baby of our own. Like any new job, there’s going to be anxiety, self-doubt, and moments of feeling out of control. Add to that the fact that most of us have internalized, at least at some level, the vestigial message that being a “good” mother is an instinctive part of being female. Then subtract the very real day-to-day support of older, experienced women (grandmothers) and the hands-on help of younger women (12-year-old daughters). And finally, calculate in the reality that most young mothers now have jobs outside their home (or the nagging feeling that they should), add husbands who aren’t as fully engaged in parenting as they might be, and we’re looking at an equation that can only produce anxiety.
These insidious speech codes are brainwashing techniques that close off all avenues leading towards freedom of speech. They obstruct your pathway towards a true understanding in how your displacement is vital to the elitist’s plans.

The only character I didn’t get was Black Widow, there just didn’t seem to be anything super about her, and that has nothing to do with me wishing I looked like Scarlett Johansson. The only thing she really had going for her was that she was a spy, and that she was one hell of a fighter. James Bond is good at shooting a gun aswell, but no one has ever called him a super hero. I’m just saying. And it annoyed me how she was fighting the bad guys with a bloody hand gun. Thor has his hammer, Captain America has his shield, Hawkeye has his bow and so on. She has a hand gun! With probably no more than 12 bullets, so what is she gonna do when it runs out? Never mind, I keep forgetting it’s a movie; of course she never runs out.
No one needs a hand-tailored jacket. Or hand-welted shoes. But I would love to buy my clothes like this: have a long chat about style, fabric, fit, finishings, where the materials are coming from, be measured to an inch of my life, and know that someone will spend the next three months or so putting my item together. Compare this to how I have been, in the past, willing to spend four figures on a handbag made by someone I will likely never meet.

Then, he goes on to say that because of this, we (Democrats, I guess he's saying) need to put aside our disdain for the Citizens United decision, and just go ahead and support super PACs. He says that this election is too important to NOT support super PACs, and that while we disagree with the decision and want it overturned, we will need the money to compete with Republicans. I CALL BULLSHIT!!!

We’re proud of Julia for being so passionate about an issue — it’s exactly the kind of attitude we encourage in our readers — so we invited her to our office to meet with editor in chief Ann Shoket this morning. They had a great discussion, and we believe that Julia left understanding that Seventeen celebrates girls for being their authentic selves, and that’s how we present them. We feature real girls in our pages and there is no other magazine that highlights such a diversity of size, shape, skin tone and ethnicity.

However, all parties must then agree and sign the deeds if the house is to be sold. It is this provision of inheritance law that causes the situation frequently seen in the Spanish countryside and villages where six brothers are part-owners of a finca.
In March Far Guy had a real bad spell. During his April appointment I asked the question “When he cannot take the pain anymore and I call you how long will it take to get him in for a Nerve Block?” The answer was two days to two weeks. I frowned and shook my head. Far Guy said “Damn.” The Doctor suggested that Far Guy try the nerve block now..NOW?? okay!!

Tuesday: I wasn’t as tired as Monday, however I was still lingering on the fact that there were no leaves sizable enough to cover my novelty sized body.

So on the subject of Lemonade or at least a subject in the citrus family.... I wanted to share a recipe I found yesterday on Face Book. It comes from a blog called The Lettered Cottage,and the recipe is Key Lime Cake.Oh my goodness does it look yummy! It just screams Summertime! I just have to make this cake for our Memorial weekend get-together.
Here is my card sample:
I want to hear it all...the good, the bad and the really ugly.
The passionate Ruekberg rocker "Girl, Don't" ups the jangle factor, while his lovely "Easier" evokes "Something". Swirsky meanwhile pines for a pair of ladies named "Genevieve" and "Sandreen", with the former the subject of a string-laden pop confection, and the latter a very 70s-sounding tune that's just as much breezy Stevie Wonder as breezy McCartney. Elsewhere "On a Summer Day" lives up to its title with its carefree melody and some great vocal interplay between our two principals, and the vaguely funky "You Do Something to Me" draws its inspiration from Paul Simon's early solo career. And like the debut with "It's No Secret", the album closes in strong fashion with "Running Away", a piano and guitar number that shifts the focus from the girls-of-their-dreams to an inward look that casts all that came before it in a different light, a well-played turn that grounds the album nicely.

Each time I have seen news reports of the loss of a hometown's military serviceman, I feel sadness for the parents who have outlived their own child, I think about the loss of one with so much left to do in life and the tragedies and unfairness of war. But I admit, one thing I don't always think about are the widows. So many young service men are also married and end up leaving behind very young wives, often with small children, to grieve for them.
I don't particularly like romance novels. But because I spent nearly two years reading them, (shout out, Diana Palmer!) I have a working knowledge of what makes a good one and what makes a bad one. This makes me the perfect person to writes a clever and scathing review of a romance novel. But why would I do that? (Other than for the opportunity to use big, impressive, degrading vocabulary words?) Do you see where I'm going with this?

Mr de Klerk, 75, said there was no justification for Mr Zuma's outspoken acolyte Julius Malema, the ANC's Youth League president, to sing Shoot the Boer. Mr Malema calls the song "a legitimate struggle" anthem but is facing a hate speech charge for singing it. "The historical context is irrelevant," Mr de Klerk said. "It would be equally unacceptable for Afrikaners to sing Boer War songs calling on people to shoot the English - or for Americans to sing World War Two songs about killing Japanese people."

Yes, just like Young Earth Creationists, they call themselves “Biblical literalists” and use their reading of various Bible passages to justify their pseudoscience (btw, it seems that all of these modern geocentrists are YECs, but not all YECs are geocentrists). I must say that it is nice to see that while most YECs may reject modern evolutionary science on the basis of their “literal” interpretation of the Bible, a large number of YECs aren’t quite so far gone as to go down the rabbit hole of geocentrism. Which, interestingly enough, begs a question: how can two different groups of people (geocentric vs. heliocentric YECs) claim two disparate “literal” readings & interpretations of Biblical scripture? How can the two groups claim to be reading & interpreting The Truth from the Bible, yet also disagree on this topic? Hmmm…
Those who hold this explanation also draw upon the phrase, “though we are speaking in this way” found in verse nine. According to Calvinists who argue in this way, the author of Hebrews is speaking in a manner contrary to reality. This is taken to be a sort of a literary wink. The writer is only giving the Church something that is hypothetically true, not true in actuality.

A correspondent draws my attention to a new stage production in which passages from great works of literature are read to the audience. To ensure customers get full value for the 20-dollar admission price, the reading is done by naked women who wouldn’t look out of place in the Playboy mansion. Those who can’t get hold of a ticket can buy a video recording for 19 dollars or an audio recording for 99 cents.
What happened yesterday played into the totalitarians’ hands. Vlaams Belang should not have been in attendance, SIOE’s banner and ideology was used against us, causing both the ban and a cleverly worded threat of retaliatory violence, which put many people off.

It's an overdone plot, but consider the fact that this evil twin can astral travel and is strong enough in astral form that she can cause harm to others, and factor in that it was written in 1981, and you can’t help feeling really impressed with Duncan’s vision. As far as I know, no one else has ever told this story with a paranormal twist, and again, remember that it was written thirty years ago.

This week and next week work was and will be hell on earth. That is why I only had a little time for painting and miniatures. Around monday I decided to point my attention to a prepainted 1:48 Spitfire by a company (unknown to me till about two weeks ago) called NewRay. A buddy bought it for me at his local toy shop and it only cost 5 €. It needs only little assembly and everything is screwed into place. Now the detail is not that perfect, but the cost is unbeatable, so that you could even build mission markers in the form of downed planes and what not. And even in this state...it's not that bad really.The wheels are retractable, which means you could use it as a flying or as a parked plane.

Now is the time for financial professionals to take a fresh look at the long-term care market and understand how current events, economic factors and changes in the law make the process of helping clients prepare for long-term care needs even more important AND achievable. As more Baby Boomers hit retirement age, there will be more need for long-term care. Also, increasing life expectancies and medical achievements suggest long-term care may be needed for longer periods of time. Finally, the reality that health care cost trends are far outpacing inflation hint at the critical need to examine all options for the funding of long-term care.

The diversity of musical styles and lyrics incorporated into songs have been the subject of much study. Robert Hunter had been contributing poems to the Dead since he and Garcia were in the army in 1960. Throughout the psychedelic revolution of the 1960s, these poems became evermore abstract and led to such songs as “That’s It for the Other One”, “China Cat Sunflower”, and “Mountains of the Moon”. It wasn’t until the Europe ’72 album was released that the wider world was able to see how Garcia’s band could turn such a psychedelic masterpiece as “China Cat Sunflower” and flow straight into a traditional bluegrass tune like “I Know You Rider”.

That being said, I am always happy to talk to any candidate who wants to know what I think about their platforms. I think the candidates would be well-advised to talk to lots of people, from a variety of backgrounds, about their platforms and start getting their direction from the people again. If a candidate wants to make AFN relevant, their platforms will have to speak to us - the grass-roots people - as much as they speak to the Chiefs. Free hint: Any platform that is written to speak to the Cons will be as useless as Atleo's.
We have gone, apparently, from £2.3 million in the black to owing something in the region £600 000. Nick himself admitted publicly on the night of the leadership challenge that the Party is £500 000 in the red. The Party’s books, therefore, need to be looked into by a small group to see what has gone wrong and where and how this can be remedied. I would suggest no more than 4 individuals- two from within the Party hierarchy who can offer explanations and two members with an accounting/investigative background, who can be relied on to be totally independent and fair. The findings need to be published.

Turning to the priest: one might argue that he produces no consumable good, and therefore gives nothing economically in return. However, this is to have an extremely one-dimensional and materialistic view of economics. The priest offers great spiritual and intellectual services. For one, in a time period where a greater proportion of the faithful go into religious life, more priests are freed to take positions as university professors and educators rather than rushing from one Mass centre to another. Certainly, it is not "nothing" to give the young the intellectual tools with which to pursue careers of their own?
So last weekend, there we were with four of my friends, in the Ateneo High School Football Field, hoping that we can realize our life-long dream of actually playing football, rather than just facing the monitor and playing football-related video games. The only kinda disappointing part of the day was that there were only 5 of us present. I certainly hope more of us could come next weekend and the following weekends after that.

She must know all in time, of course, but later, when she's stronger.
Finally to mention the stunning poses from Glitterati. While the first and last are from different sets, but I’m also showing poses from the new ‘Hips’ release which will be available later today. Katey Coppola has thought this through carefully, including the same poses to suit the ‘modelesque’ avie, the avie with ‘junk in the trunk’ and a happy medium. That kind of forethought is bound to make for very happy customers.

Barack Obama’s Presidency and his chance of reelection could very well be defined by what happens over the next week. If the Senate fails to raise the debt ceiling either temporarily or permanently, panic selling of U.S. dollars could drive the greenback to fresh lows against all of the major currencies. The weakness of USD/JPY and USD/CHF confirms that investors are worried about the developments or the lack thereof in the coming week.

In my neck of the woods, December 25th passed rather uneventfully, except for a Palestinian terror attack on Friday at noon, where a fun loving Palestinian took a hunting rifle and starting shooting at Jewish motorists.
After college, I didn't paint for a long time (this thing called law school.. not a whole lot of time for much else, although I did manage to still eat and sleep, occasionally). After the bar exam, I had 3 months to do nothing but wait on results. So, I picked up my paint brush again. Here's a recap of the last year and a half. The Bodie Houston Gallery on rewind (and it's easy to see where my roots are... SC... the south... the low country... coastal everything... how I love thee) :
Five minutes later I received an anguished phone call from Hubby – the bus was early and already at the stop, waiting for Mr. Sensitive. There was no time for the special before school snack! Mr. Sensitive realized this, started crying, refused to get on the bus and had to be forcibly placed on the bus by Hubby. Hubby felt sick about it – I could hear tears in his voice, “I didn’t have time to give him his chocolate, I feel terrible.”
I can almost smell it, hear the raucous shout grow louder upon the chill wind, the tread of zombie feet, the smell of beer and the fluttering of foreign flags, two sides of the same coin EDL and IslamUK both entrapping the bitter, the angry and the unknowledgeable, strange really as those that shout out for “INGurlanddd!!” aid the very agenda that sends our soldiers there and those that advocate Islam, insure attack within the lands of the prophet, both sides offering up their sons in a war for others, stupidity against stupidity whilst we ,the few, stand in horror, souls gripped by despair and dismay weighing upon our hearts.
Quick background: The word translated as "hell" in many Bibles is in the original Greek "hades", which simply means death or the grave. Translating it as "hell" is a theological statement, not a linguistic one. And knowing that wipes out most of the texts that are usually cited in support of the hellfire doctrine.
Yesterday at the dinner table a new sign made its appearance: eye-rolling! My goodness. And last week, after a family dinner in our little downtown, he ditched us to hang out with his friends on First Friday (when the shops are open past 5 or 6). He was part of a roaming pack of teenagers! (We sort of observed at a distance for part of the time and hoped, when they were out of sight, that they were behaving nicely.)

Can the alien abduction phenomena be separated from that unconscious, and why would we assume an alien would think our conscious mind was the 'real' mind to visit? Why wouldn't an alien prefer to make unconscious contact rather than the conscious variety. My unconscious is far more literate and witty than my conscious one - I'm sure it's a lot better company. How else could it blow my mind every night with crazy dreams? When I try to get involved with my unconscious mind's creative process, my tongue ties almost instantly. I'm the editor, trying to translate its rantings, clipping the more negative tirades, but I can't control the actual ideas and flow. Surely that unconscious connection is even more true of Walken, who has a rare gift where every line he says sounds like it's coming straight from his unconscious rather than a script, and that's true even when he is clearly reading from cue cards (as on his many SNL appearances).

As the Nazarene once counselled, "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone." We all cast shadows. There is not one person on the planet whose darker side does not dot the Earth in some way under the light of the sun and the moon. The higher up we grow from the ground, the deeper the shadow we leave behind, the more humility we must have to embrace the dark, and the more likely our ego will try to go awry if left unchecked.

Parked the Jetta, grabbed my notes, and headed up to the "classroom"...and got a glass of Penn Gold. Seemed like the right beer for 10:15 AM, and it was: that same extra-glassy smoothness, teasingly delicate malt character...yeah. Made a conscious decision that I'd have to have a talk with the caffeine and not drink too fast. Luckily, people started to wander in, and we got conversing -- great people at these things! -- and there was no problem.

Three Second Kiss are a guitar-bass-drums "power trio" from Bologna. They're among the most celebrated artists of the Italian math-rock scene, which is quite renown abroad.

"Eight Miles High" was first recorded on December 22, 1965, at RCA Studios in Hollywood. But the Byrds' record label was Columbia, which insisted that the song be re-recorded at that company's record studio.
"Hayek initially thought the dividing line between possible and impossible positivism lay in the distinction between natural sciences and social sciences, but by the 1950s he had come to understand that the issue was really one of complexity. A positivist, predictive science is possible only for phenomena, whether human or natural, that are relatively simple- particle physics, for example. One can never fully model and predict complex phenomena such as the spontaneous orders produced by the interactions of simpler agents. These orders include the human brain, whose higher functions cannot possibly be inferred from its physical substratum, as well as ecosystems and, of course, markets, cultures, and other human institutions."

This is by far one of the best albums of the 90s. I was a short pasty white girl that was wishing fervently that someday I would grow up to look and sing like Lauryn Hill. I still remember the picture on the inside jacket and just being blown away by how beautiful she was. Everything that came out of her mouth sounded so profound.

I have had a war on with the loyalty programs for quite some time. I do not believe they are in place to award me savings of any description. I believe they are all about data mining. I avoid them. I often ask the cashiers at the registers to use the counter card so I too can pay the lower price for an item. Some do this without pause. Others take the opposite path. On these occasions I have the choice to leave without the items selected, pay the greater price and move on or, I can choose to stand my ground and if that means holding up a line and calling a manager then I have to be prepared to be hated by those in line behind me.

Unfortunately, the UN will not demand that the West withdraw its support of the Syrian rebels, and instead use the violence to continue with their original plan – the establishment of “humanitarian corridors” and “safe zones” by armed NATO troops. From these established zones, the rebels can continue their campaign of violence against the Syrian people in pursuit of dividing and destroying Syria as a sovereign nation-state, in line not with “international law,” but in the interests of Western imperial ambitions.

On a whim, I did a Google search for Punisher pics by Big John, and discovered a trade paper back that collected a five-issue story arc from 1994's Punisher: War Zone.

Since much of the news out of Mexico concerns itself with the violence of the country's drug wars to hear someone say that Mexico is, for the most part, about as safe as Toronto may come as a shock. But to those who actually live there they seem quite happy to set the record straight for you.
In short, the house in question belongs to a lovely French lady who leads a conversation group I've been attending for the past two years. She has made it a tradition to invite the group to her place in the spring but in spring 2009, she was knee deep in renovations and this past spring, her husband was quite ill. So she rescheduled for last weekend. Although the group initially started last fall with around 15 members, only four of us faithfully attended until the end of the year and believe me, it was worth it!
A number of folks I know tire of the kid-friendly policy there. Not me. While I find the uncontrolled playground atmosphere during the early dinner hours distracting, I also feel that it’s great that we have places where kids can see adults drinking responsibly.

A proposal also was made to modify Flood Prone Zone F. The opening and closing of the zone has been based on the level of the White River at St. Charles and the Arkansas River at Lock and Dam 1. The change would be to eliminate the use of the St. Charles gauge and incorporate the Graham Burke Outlet gauge. The closing reading would be 150 msl and the opening reading would be 148 msl. The Lock and Dam 1 closing would remain at 145 msl and opening at 143 msl.

Of course, after a violation of a statute, the executive could refrain from prosecuting the offender or even pardon him. Until the legislature changed the law, however, neither the legislature nor the executive could simply tell a favored person that he was not bound by it.

It’s all a bit messy, what with Andrew Wilkie out there trying to get even for the betrayal, and let’s not forget the spectre of Tony Abbott as PM on the horizon. If he resigns, then surely it puts an early election on the agenda for the government and of course the chances of the ALP wining that are miniscule.
Beyond that, we’re making plans for the personal stuff: getting our documents, finances, and personal belongings squared away for our long absence. Amanda has developed a detailed week-by-week plan of attack for sorting through our stuff, packing up what we want to keep (which won’t be much), and selling or donating the rest. She’s convinced me that the best way to do our big moving-out garage sale is estate-style: leaving our stuff where it is in the house, sticking price tags on it, and just opening our doors for people to roam around and carry off what they want. I was a little weirded out by the idea at first, but it will be easier, and we’ll have our own stuff out by then. And it’s a rental house. Meh.
"It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."

Paso Doble is a rather easy dance, once one understands how to perform it. You must dance on angles, in diagonal lines, and with a wide silhouette. I don’t think Sugar Ray did any of those things. His posture, as well, was unacceptable for Paso. Although his posture has improved since the beginning of the competition, Paso requires you to carry your centre of gravity in the upper sternum; as a result, the hips should be carried forward, though the front should never be collapsed. I saw no difference in Sugar Ray’s posture from last week to this week.

Remarkably still alive and well and living in Alicante, Trinidad-born Snr Ros began his estimable career as a pioneer of Rumba music in London during the Second World War. Apparently a favourite of Royals and the masses alike, his inspired Latin American cover versions of popular standards became staple fodder for afficonados of middle-of-the-road music. He has recorded more than 800 albums, selling millions in the process. Despite offically retiring in 1975, his most recent recordings were released in 1994!

Deep inside the box, Mitch unearths his mom's journal from 1967, the year before he was born. He knows he shouldn’t read it (especially the way his mom feels about “privacy invasion”), but come on now, who wouldn’t? And as Mitch reads, he discovers secrets. His mom got kicked out of her house when she became a hippie war protester. Mitch’s parents have these two best friends he’s never even heard of but were drafted into the Vietnam War. And his grandparents might not be dead after all.

The priest breaks the Bread and puts a piece of the host into the chalice to signify the unity of the Body and Blood of the Lord in the work of salvation, namely, of the living and glorious Body of Jesus Christ. The supplication Agnus Dei or “Lamb of God”, is, as a rule, sung by the choir or cantor with the congregation responding; or it is, at least, recited aloud. This invocation accompanies the fraction and, for this reason, may be repeated as many times as necessary until the rite has reached its conclusion, the last time ending with the words dona nobis pacem (grant us peace).

According to accepted ideas, the neighborhood around the Sun should be filled with dark matter. Billions of these particles should be rushing through us every second. But the most accurate study yet of motions of stars in the Milky Way, recently completed, has found no evidence for dark matter in a large volume of space around the Sun. That is, the matter we can see can account for the motion we see, leaving no sign of dark matter.

Daegu completed the transformation, as American women were solid from the 100 through the 1500 with Carmelita Jeter winning the 100 and taking silver in the 200; Allyson Felix taking silver in the 400 and bronze in the 200; two finalists in the 800 with Montano centimeters from a medal; and in spite of our favored runner getting tripped in the 1500 we STILL came through with gold! Throw in gold in the 400 hurdles, silver and bronze in the 100 hurdles and a dominating sweep of both relays, and I would say that our women are in prime position as we head into the Olympic season, because in addition to the medalists form Daegu, we had outstanding depth over the course of the season.

IN THE DAYS OF NOAH, the whole world was deluded. Yet, the whole world tried to make Noah feel he was deluded as he, under the supreme direction of God, built and ark of safety and escape from the wrath to come. Noah was faithful to warn the people.

Faithful and true men and women of God are still sounding the alarm, “Save yourselves from this untoward, (wicked) generation.” Acts 2:40

This is a black book I have. I started to write down dates that I had disturbing dreams – trust me, there are plenty. Eventually I began writing small snyopsis of the dream. I was trying to find some pattern. No pattern evolved over the five years that I religiously kept this list going. I did find though was pretty disturbing – things I was dreaming of were happening. So guess what I did? I listed this, every time something happened that made me think of a dream Id had I would note in the dream book in another colour under the dream. I wrote the date and what had happened. I think I began to scare myself so I stopped writing the dreams down.

I was invited to dinner at Moti Mahal to see what Taittinger could do when paired with Indian food as well as meet Clovis Taittinger, the next in line at Taittinger. Clovis was in town last week to show off what his family champagne can do when paired with Indian cuisine.Clovis is known as a bit of a wild man and upon meeting him, I could see why – rushing down the stairs, slightly disheveled hair with impish smile and friendly air. He’s like a French, slimmer, darker version of our Mayor, Boris Johnson – and just as amusing. He had us all chuckling within 1 minute of opening his mouth, something about the Kama Sutra and champagne, I think.

Amazing how a modern kitchen technique, an age old paste of Italian origin and spices from India can give you such a truly authentic curry. Back in the days, India was the destination for spices. Just the other day, I was reading up on all the voyages that were directed towards India in earlier centuries for spices like cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cloves and all things fragrant. So much risk, such long lonely voyages. Such distant land, cultures. All for spices. And if you are sitting at your desk with your coffee (as I am doing now), you may wonder what was all that allure.

Swedish singer Lykke Li's second album is a vast improvement over her modest and intermittently enjoyable debut Youth Novels. Not only has Li's voice matured, grown dark and tormented rather than cutesy, but her songcraft has improved as well, so that each track here is an efficient, emotionally charged pop nugget. Producer Björn Yttling, who also produced and co-wrote her debut, has swathed Li's songs in a sparse, dark production style that's perfectly suited to her confessional lyrics. Li's inclusion on the soundtracks to the second Twilight movie and various CW teen dramas makes perfect sense, and her youthful earnestness and emotional honesty allow her to pull off lines like "sadness is my boyfriend" and make them feel like they come from a really deep, painful place. Wounded Rhymes is as moody and changeable as a confused teen, equally prone to bursts of scattered psycho-sexual aggression — "like a shotgun/ needs an outcome/ I'm your prostitute/ you gon' get some," she sneers on "Get Some," making her come-on feel like a death threat — and diaristic moping, like the achingly pretty "Unrequited Love," on which Li's voice sobs above a quietly plucking backdrop.

I still have a fair amount of the rice vermicelli in the house, that mostly I've always used when I want to make spring rolls. But I've been trying to use them in a less work-intensive way, eliminating the need for rolling things. Because right now, I have no time for time consuming foods. Not until after spring break, anyway, when I should be far enough ahead that I have time to sit, to think, and even to sleep sometimes. It'll be exciting. Anyway, this is a pretty easy recipe. I actually cooked the noodles before I went to school, then did the rest when I came home and that's a perfectly fine way to do it although it's not particularly necessary. Hope you enjoy!

Hey hey hey! It's ABC Monday at Catch The Bug and it's my turn to show you Anything But A Card! I wanted to try something new- Making embellishments with Shrink Plastic. Today, I have this cute name badge holder to show you. I made this name badge/time card holder for a co-worker to celebrate Nurse's Week. I figured it would be cute to wear on her uniform at work. The image is Raggedy Nurse, by Bugaboo Stamps and is colored with Promarkers. I printed the image on white shrink plastic, cut her out then shrunk her down to make this cutie. Then I attached her to my badge clip with E6000 adhesive. She's going to be a big hit! (Tip: You can use shrink plastic to make your own embellishments like this one, to use on cards and other crafting goodies!)

The South Africans have got a massive responsibility, but no one seems to be attacking them. Basically they (ASA) have known for months, for years, that she’s not normal. They could have set in process these kind of tests if they had been more responsible.”

Sadly (because you don't know how many times a day I check my blog at work to see if anyone has left a comment),
This guy here is not metrosexual anymore, he is just crossing over. In my opinion, this is just way to much… whatever happened to admitting that you are actually gay? No offense to all the fans of Bae Yong Joon, but this type of metrosexuality is kind of confusing.
Standing on the stone platform you realize that the sounds you heard before are coming from below. A quick examination of the platform reveals the outline of some sort of doorway. It is mostly covered in sand. The sounds remind you of waves crashing on a beach.

Tossing the bucket of "Rally-O Crap" into the back of the car, I raced back (as quickly as slippery sandals will allow) to release the dogs from their captivity and allow them to "sprint to freedom". Apparently "sprint to freedom" means different things to different dogs. To Gio, it meant high-tail it towards the parking lot, leap gracefully over the low fence and take shelter in the relatively dry car interior. To Romeo, on the other hand, it meant run frantically in circles, freaking out whenever he left the shelter of the trees and got pelted with rain/hail, eventually give up and pout in a soppy little Sheltie puddle to wait for me to rescue him and carry him to the car.
This might suit the paler complexions who are looking for a "healthy tan" complexion or ladies with a slightly darker skin tone.
In this post, I will help you understand nature of your newborn. It is better to be prepared so that you can enjoy blessings of parenthood.
Weakness: Confidence has been the issue with the Musketeers. As the fight with Cincinnati was a turning point for the better for the Bearcats, it had the opposite effect on Xavier. They just haven’t had the same swagger since that they actually played that game with. They have to get that back if they want to have success in the tournament.

Here's one more chocolate cake recipe for Cinco de Mayo: Buttermilk Mexican Chocolate Cake. I adapted this from a recipe in Southern Living a few years ago. I've added ground chiles and used Taza Mexican Chocolate with Chiles for a little more kick. I usually bake this pound cake in a bundt pan. This is quick and easy and delicious.
So I'm just sharing a few tags from what I've managed to cook up so far.

Random Stan Facts:
Alternative educator? Artist? Author? Meditation instructor? S.M.G.W.M? Who is here to say with clarity & conviction what I AM? Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of bumping into some amazing teachers & mentors; people who have changed me in unspoken ways. People who have elevated my life experience with hope, meaning, joy and purpose. Through the use of creativity, teaching, speaking and writing I have enjoyed sharing the gifts I have inherited from others: Roxi Hermson, Leonard Orr, Deepak Chopra, Stephen Wolinsky, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, Mooji, Hafiz and Louise Thomson to name a few. It is the artist, free thinker, poet, advocate and friend, who has inspired this life I call my own. With image and word, in private practice, one-on-one or group facilitation, and service, that I have touched meaning, purpose and peace; something magical that lies beyond the thinking mind.
I'm never disappointed by Gallery Books. I've found that they are consistently well written quality stories. Midwife of Venice was another great addition to the collection.
It was dinner with steak and Vienetta for dessert on Sundays, the longing for a summer vacation that never wanted to come and I was in love with a boy.
Everyday I ask myself that question. I intend on spending the rest of the year contemplating it.
I had an older photo of a house whose picture hung on the wall. They brought out their picture and we discussed differences, which led them to remember further stories which will be helpful for my book.

“Ask of Him: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.”
In the announcement to be made Monday, Ms. Reding will call for a new round of consultations with governments, trade unions, companies and civil groups. The move comes a year after she called on companies to take voluntary steps to increase the representation of women on boards to 30 percent by 2015 and to 40 percent by 2020, by replacing departing male directors. …Ms. Reding said that the severe economic downturn in Europe that has pressured companies to focus on their bottom lines was not responsible for the failure of her voluntary initiative. “It is really a question of society,” she said.
On page 8, in the best sequence in the story, Cole delightfully plays with sound effects, slyly sending a wolf whistle between a woman’s sexy legs, creating a great visual pun. A couple of panels later, her shriek begins in her mouth. A whole book could be written on what Cole did with sound effects in comics.
Not only did my eating get off track a lot last week, but so did my workouts. I still managed 4, but one was only a 2.75 mile walk, so to me it feels more like 3. Which felt like not enough at all. Monday and Tuesday were fine, I did the barbell strength class, and cover 6.2 miles (the last 3 with a run/walk combo) on the treadmill on Tuesday. I took Wednesday and Thursday off, went for a walk with Ryann on Friday, took Saturday off, and covered just under 5 miles yesterday (probably just under a mile of that was walking). So it isn't like I didn't work out or anything, but it definitely felt wrong to me.
Hello Fellow Beer Lovers,
Fearless
We will be adding more relevant events (official and unofficial) as we learn about them, so check back often!
The 3 gallon ice cream containers were rotated from the zero degree freezer to a smaller freezer to allow it to soften some. Friday nights did not allow for this step, therefore, the ice cream was rock hard. My public, however, would not wait. The end result was the development of my right hand, wrist, and forearm. The job lasted through my freshmen year in college. My ice cream powered grip lasted until two years ago.
So I just thought, ok it'll eventually dry, I might have to recoat a fews times, but it'll stick eventually. So that's what I did.
Oh, but that is my job. And as my dad would put it, in an utterly un-fluffy or overly philosophical way, “suit up and show up,” it’s almost spring break after all. And, that’s good advice too.
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York ... ABC Family ... 6:30 PM
Sometimes (okay, OFTEN) I get tired of pointing this out: That just because you can say, “Adam Walsh!” or “Jaycee Dugard!” that doesn’t mean that there are MORE children being abducted today than ever before. It’s just easier to NAME them, because we see them so much on TV. Those images get filed away in our heads and when we ask our brains, Google-like, “Is it safe for me to ever let go of my child’s hand?” up pop the most popular stories about that topic, not necessarily the most salient or helpful ones.
For those of you who are part of the official Blood Coven Facebook page, you know I promised an excerpt once we reached over 3,000 "Likes". Well, you did it! And now it's time to fulfill that promise!
I wasn't planning on purchasing it for a while since I have no where to store it until we move but the price has gone up twice now and I was afraid that it was going to go up again. It's scheduled to be delivered on Friday and I'm really looking forward to seeing it in person since it's received so many great reviews!
(Moms of boys can insert laughter here, knowing it isn’t at all as easy as I’d envisioned. What can I say—I’d never had a child of any kind before! I was a foolish innocent.)

The effort to create a harmonic synthesis of different elements, (youth-maturity and wood-iron), was also adopted in the organization of the programmatic areas, like the cashier, the storage, the display benches, tables and surfaces.
So many times bright words I’ve sought
Lagman must have felt like Julius Caesar during the Ides of March. In a privilege speech after Arroyo was placed under hospital arrest for electoral sabotage in connection to the 2007 senatorial polls, he slammed the Aquino government for having “no single, credible, and competent evidence presented … to substantiate its fears and speculations that the former President is a flight risk.”
As you can see from the synopsis, this is a dark book; certainly darker than I was expecting. In fact, I would say it is quite a bleak book with sadness creeping over me as I read further. For example, Vera hears a husband abuse his wife pretty much every day but is encouraged by her father to pretend she doesn't hear anything. Charlie sells his underwear to an old man for significant amounts of money, again with Vera turning a blind eye and not reporting anything.

I can’t quite figure out why they have included mince meat and Thomas the Tank Pez in this section. If anybody has any insight into this choice, please let me know. But I have decided not to complain, it seems fairly harmless.
But I also had to take a few photos of the magnolia tree blooming in the front yard before we left. I thought it was gorgeous! There's a sign on the front porch that asks you not to ring the doorbell because it is a residence. People must try to ring the doorbell a lot to try to get a peek inside. It was the afternoon and I figured if someone lived in the house they would be at work so I very gingerly climbed the stairs halfway up the front porch to try to get a better angle of some of the flowers. I took a few quick shots then returned to the sidewalk.
However those looking for a Hagiography are likely to be disappointed. Resolution is positive quality when she was right, however, she was wrong (or at least hugely at odds with the public, which to a democratic politician is the same thing) over the poll tax. Here, her resolute stance appears neatly to the viewer as pig-headedness. The scene in which she delivers a savage dressing down of Geoffrey Howe in cabinet was brilliantly acted, and Streep's performance offered a hint of derangement. You can certainly see why her colleagues thought the time had come for her to go. Of course the issue that sent Howe out of the cabinet was her refusal to commit to a timetable for European Monetary Union. How's that decision worked out, Geoffrey?
The children play in the hospital room. They are used to rooms like this, with a television mounted to the ceiling and anti-microbial sanitizer that comes out if you shake your butt near the motion detector. Heh heh heh.
Krishna had assigned me some other work the past few weeks. And today after a looong gap, I had a chance to chant Vishnu Sahasranamam this morning. I could feel little golden sparkly lights all inside. It is soooo nice. And I kept thinking of Thirupati Venkateswaraswamy, which was so lovely!
Now I do.

I am curious to what you have been up to, so anything goes on this linky party!
It will start on Cheri's Blog....
Last weekend when Emily was sick, we had a lot of downtime at the hospital. We sat there with our sweet little girl, who just felt like crap, wishing the doctor would move just a little bit faster. She was so sick and we were very worried. I remember thinking, "This is only temporary. This is only temporary. She's going to get better and this isn't going to last forever."
Thank you for visiting and viewing my photos!
Check out the Challenge details on their blog, check my sidebar--I can't seem to make it show up here!
Thanks for stopping by my blog today and hope you all have a lovely weekend
I made this fresh take on chicken salad for lunch today for Jimmy and I. I think you can pretty much add avocado to anything, top it with a little cilantro and squeeze over some fresh lime juice and it will taste like spring and be delicious. This was no exception.
Now, they really scare crap out of me, no girls are willing to talk to me unless I said I'm a Cullen fan and will be going to the “how to be a cool vampire course” which cost me RM 5000 a month.. Will you in any chance still think vampires doesn’t suck?
Here are closeups of the individual quilt blocks. It is so beautiful. Different colors of greens and whatever is in season, they give you a taste. We had two kinds of lettuce and some baby carrots.
The goal in mind is to cater to certain travelers needs. This seems to be a growing trend. I have seen other hotels include workout machines in guests rooms as well.
Elaine Coffman has written 19 novels and sold 5 million books. The Return of Black Douglas is a response to reader requests for books about the Scottish ancestors of Coffman’s bestselling seven-book historical Mackinnon series, the last of which was a New York Times bestseller.

If you want your frog finger puppet to be a toad finger puppet instead, you could use olive green felt and cut muddy brown spots out using the eye pupil circle from my pattern. Then, sew the spots at random on the body and face of the your toad. Muddy brown French knots can enhance the toady look.

Also, we celebrated my middle son's birthday on the first. He turned 6! Where has my baby gone?! They are growing up way too fast! And soon after I slowly took down all my Christmas things. It is so depressing. I really miss not having the Christmas decorations up. I am still working on taking the outside stuff down. I have to put the lights away and it is such a chore. Who wants to do it for me? LOL. After putting things away I started tweaking my other things around. Plus, I have to make room for something I am going to pick it up on Saturday. I don't want to say what it is yet. I don't want to jinx it. I'll post pictures of it when I get it. But I am sooooooooooooo happy to finally have one!!!!!! It's my birthday gift. Well, my pre-birthday gift. My birthday isn't until the 27th, but who's counting?
Another nose-wrinkle. "Nah, I've already read everything good. There's really not much left. I think I'm out of books."
Because today, I step out as a Journalist. With a capital “J”, because now I’ve earned it. Now it’s not just a far out dream, a fight with advisors, a plea of my parents, a hope in my heart. Now it’s real. I did it. I finished! A long 11 years late. But as they say it’s better late than never. The 11 years taught me what it was to work, what it was to manage my time, what it was to juggle responsibilities, to find my way, to make me sure this is what I wanted. And if I wanted it 11 years ago, I can assure you I want it more than ever now. Seeing my name printed on a glossy piece of paper means more to me than any dollar amount can sum up to. The thrill, the pride, the excitement, the honor – now that’s what being a JOURNALIST is all about. I hope to educate you, to inspire you, to compel you, to fire you up, to make you aware, to guide you, to help you understand, to make you ask questions, to make you skeptical, to make you believe, to give you hope but most importantly to teach you what you may not know. Journalists are the every day educators. Educators of what’s going on in the world, educators of health, of business, of fashion, of diet, of tragedy, of government, of YOU!
Sheep have been added to the yard again, and they've managed to decimate a few favourite trees with their enthusiasm, but it wont be long now until harvest time, then we'll just be left with an old retiree, Pinky, to help keep the grass down, eliminating the need for a lot of the mowing.

“I don’t want any name on my grave, because I have never had a name of my own,” he told me. “I only want those two lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Kubla Khan.”
I hope you are enjoying your Memorial Day weekend! We've a full house over here - along with the joys and the trials inherent to that scenario. Mixed bag, lemme tell you. Easy it is not. Without the gospel perfuming our ways and informing our decisions and affecting the very seat of our emotions, we would have kicked one another to the curb a long time ago. Our family is no different than yours.
A study published in Child Development involving almost 6,000 children, age 12 and younger, found that boys who were insecurely attached to their mothers acted more aggressive and hostile later in childhood—kicking and hitting others, yelling, disobeying adults and being generally destructive.
But anyway! That's what I've been up to. How about you?
No walking on the beach in this get up...sand in the shoes would be quite uncomfortable.
At first, it may seem as though this entry stands in contrast to yesterday’s reflection, but really it’s not. While yesterday I encouraged us to reflect on finding the Divine inside, today is a gentle reminder to embrace the human side of our lives.

Because of all the scheduling changes, we ended up seeing a different pediatrician than we normally see, but he was nice. He checked her out and told us that everything is perfect.
I've been hesitant to post on here. I think it's all out of fear. I guess I should start with the news. I'm pregnant. Two days after my last post I took a test and it was positive. I find it funny that while I was posting about how I'm afraid I'll never be pregnant or have a child, that I was in fact pregnant. I'm 7 weeks and 3 days today.

The Meh: As good as Lawrence was in the character of Katniss, it simply is not the same as following her internal monologue – her questions, her doubts, her feelings about Peeta and memories of her home are essential to the development of her character. We see glimpses of that – in her alliance with Rue, flashes of the memory of Peeta and the bread, Gale’s reactions to the games – but, it isn’t the same. The development of the characters and their motivations isn’t present in the movie which makes it difficult for an audience to really care about them.
The cost of onshore wind is already falling and is now on a par with coal and nuclear, though it is still more expensive than gas.There are already more than 3,500 turbines onshore in the UK and this is expected to increase as part of Government policy to more than double capacity.
Meanwhile, the bus entrance was totally blockaded by us “J people.” We had become one human wall, one mass, one anticipating, impatient and uncompromising being. So when any other bus came by trying to pick up some passengers, they were unable to climb on due to the wall. That is when I saw the first woman — a beautiful, young 20-something year old with carefully combed shiny hair — pull the hair of a woman in front of her. “Me dejaron pasar!” (Let me pass!) she yelled, her eyes on fire. The middle-aged woman whose hair had been so unexpectedly violated, stared back at her emptily; she was too shocked to react. What followed can hardly be related here, but it was messy and involved a multitude of Spanish words I do not know.

The best reaction so far to this entire thing was from a little boy in my neighborhood. My mom was talking to his mom about the entire trip, and she mentioned the forty one pairs of flip-flops.
when bonzo was a couple weeks old he cried and cried and cried on and off for a handful of days. and it seemed like there was nothing i could do to stop him – and, at the time, i felt that the crying needed to be stopped for his own comfort. it was extremely stressful and made me feel helpless and out of my league. one evening when i was knee-deep in a crying baby and feeling a bit incompetent and powerless, i remembered a tiny mention – just a sentence or two – from a dr. sears book where he basically said that if all baby's immediate needs have been met and the baby is still crying, just to offer your calm, loving arms and let him cry.

Those of you who follow my Guardian column will know that I've had a bit of a rant today about the relentless pressure on us to buy our 'loved ones' (loathe that expression) a bottle of pink champagne. It's not that I mind pink fizz as such I just resent the mark-ups the champagne producers put on it and the fact that the discounts are never as good as they seem.

Obviously, the Far East (and the rest of the world) as we know it today hardly resembles the way it was in ancient times, but yet there are still remnants of the evil that spread from that ancient region visible, particularly among the darker-skinned tribes who still practise various forms of witchcraft and who seem intent on keeping age-old primitive traditions that have a remarkable affiliation with the ways of Cain.
This morning I was walking with my dear friend talking about blogs. I said something about my blog and she said "Hasn't your blog been discontinued?" Well, actually it hasn't, I told her. Feeling a little defensive about it, I guess I should start it all again.
In Vanity Fair, she said: ““I have this effect on people where it starts out good. Then, when I’m in these relationships with people who are also creative, or creative in their own way, what happens is the attraction is initially there and it’s all unicorns and rainbows. And then they hate me.”

All things are permissible... but not everything is profitable. Regardless of the ratings, etc., consider whether that movie, or this book, or those songs are profitable. Are they edifying? To they build up or tear down? Is there anything to profit from by reading/watching/listening this or that.

After he gave me no choice but to break up with him, I confessed to my keyboard all the things that I feared would always remind me of him: the color yellow, the Yankees, the entire state of Connecticut, Jeep Wranglers…

The hens are laying well. I am getting 4 eggs a day (though that means some hens are slacking!). One of the young hens has started laying - her egg is on the left!

The warmth affected me in smaller ways. I got anxious to plant and ended up getting my pepper and tomato seedlings started a few weeks earlier than I normally would. It should all end well as I tend to plant a bit earlier than many in my area. Our average last frost is May 9th here. By my records, it has been late April for the past 6 years that I have kept track. We tend to have a frost warning sometime in the second week of May, but a quick blanket over the tomatoes protects them and the frost has never actually materialized.
This is not news coverage but revolutionary romanticism...The article does not tell us that they are in prison for a reason...thrown into prison after trials. Most of them admit -- indeed brag about -- their crimes...they were heroes of an armed struggle defined in genocidal terms....The Palestinian Authority and Hamas holds these people as role models...these are the people still in prison because of the bloodiness of their crimes after Israel has released hundreds of others...
Ha! Just had to add a close up on the photo. It is so revealing. I don't have any poker face whatsoever. I'm like an open book. I cut out the photo with a Nestabilities die (Large Circles) and the background from 1905 using another Nestabilities die called Lacey Circles.
Life is so hard. As we struggle through it we often lose focus of the big picture and what is most important to us. But over a break like this, even through dealing with the two funerals, I am so blessed to be challenged to regain focus.
The most amazing moment of the night came at the end, when Sara brought up Sonos, a local a cappella group, to sing "Gravity" with her. "Gravity" is probably my all-time favorite Sara B. song. It might very well be my favorite song of all time, it is that good. It stirs my heart every time I hear it. And her performance at The Orpheum was no exception.

I certainly though have not been denying myself some decent beers, including another trip to the Cardiff beer shop to pick up some new bottles. I did tend to hit the more well known names this time, Thronbridge and Kernel bottles, Mikkeller and Anchor again.

Boil 2 cups of water and steep tea bags for 3-4 minutes. Allow hot tea to cool down or add some cool water to cool it down. Pour tea with fresh hulled strawberries and lemon juiced into a blender and blend until smooth. Strain the blended mixutre with a fine mesh strainer. Add remaining water and sugar or sweetener. Taste. Garnishes with fresh strawberries and/or lemons. Enjoy.
What we did for "Fun Friday": It was a rainy day, which means it is a good day to stay inside around here since you practically need a boat to get around parts of our yard when it is wet. The kids played a few "games" online (Ooka Island, Big Bibletown), colored in their doodle books, tried their hands at I Spy, worked on paper dolls (the girls), and listened to Adventures in Odyssey. You can listen to episodes online at OnePlace and even watch episodes at Jelly Telly.
Osirians can live for thousands of years, even without sufficient food or water. Despite this, they do need air to survive and can suffocate. Osirian curry was best served close to absolute zero, which suggests an especially resilient digestive system.
Trip Report--Huzzah!, Portland, Maine, 3-6 May 2012
When I go to the movies, I want to be entertained by comedy and lots of car chases. That’s about it. I know it’s not deep, but that’s what interests me. If I’m going to spend an arm and a leg for two hours of my time, I want it to be well worth it. In fact, many years ago when I was dating my wife, I actually took her to see Lethal Weapon 4 for her birthday (a bad decision on my part). But I wanted to be entertained. If not, I can just wait until the movie comes out for rent. Generally speaking, there are two types of movies that I don’t watch in the movie theater: documentaries, and love stories.

One of the first things an observer may notice, even from afar, is that I am a very passionate person. I am passionate about what I believe in and will stand my ground, preaching from my soapbox until the cows come home. I am passionate about my friends and family. Upset someone I love, and pissed off hornets and fire breathing dragons will look like fluffy bunnies in comparison. I am passionate about what I do. I do not give bits and pieces of me. I am either willing to give something or someone every thing I have in me, or nothing at all. It is that simple.

The other problem we were having is that he would not wake up when he got hungry. He didn't recognize his hunger for what it was, so he would sleep through it. He is IMPOSSIBLE to wake up. Cold towels, naked baby, tickling the foot, baths. Nothing worked. He would get furious, but as soon as I'd stop harassing him, he'd be totally asleep. When we tried to get him to eat when he wasn't fully awake, he would choke even more, or gag. It was lovely. The following are some pictures I took while he was supposed to be eating:

I will start my investigation from myself where I will look how through time I have defined myself as a picture and what experiences, believes, ideas I hold around My picture. I am the one who created myself as picture, who filled, painted and outlined it – so I must be the one to undo it and thus remove the limited definition that separates myself from all that is here as the equal substance.
1) It's about a girl who is trapped below ice for eleven minutes and lives with no brain damage. Or does she have brain damage? First off, I'm going to give this book huge kudos for such a fantastic concept. The idea of falling below ice is etched into our minds as something totally terrifying, and FRACTURE delivers.

We cut ours into eight pieces but 12 wouldn't hold up very well under the knife so I don't recommend you cutting sections that small.

This explanation of respondent is untenable. The name appearing in the “Roll of Attorneys” is “Dionisio D. Ramos”. The attorney’s roll or register is the official record containing the names and signatures of those who are authorized to practice law. A lawyer is not authorized to use a name other than the one inscribed in the Roll of Attorneys in his practice of law.
I've tried using beetroot before in my bakes so I know it does work but it's my first time to try using zucchini. The cake itself is easy to make. Somehow you wouldn't be able to taste the vegetables in it. My son never noticed anything different. It was very moist ( in a very good way) NOT wet and soggy .The only thing I didn't like is that it came out a bit flat which maybe due to the zucchini and beetroot.

The thing that needs to be said here is that this isn’t what we assumed would happen in the game – it is exactly what we EXPERIENCED happening in the game. For a couple of reasons. Firstly because in Call of Cthulhu, it’s rare that all your skills can work at once. Whereas in Esoterrorists, you’re most often standing in a crime scene or evidence scene, using your eyeballs and inherent knowledge. So you ARE rattling things off. This is doubly true in a social situation where you are using your eyeballs on a suspect. Bam bam bam, until we get a hit. And of course, the nature of the game, as written, is playing Find the Box, so players quickly learn to seek the box as quickly as possible.

And the creativity seeps out to the story itself. Taking down kings to expand a kingdom isn’t a totally original concept, but the kings you meet certainly leave a strong impression. They consist of the drunk, the obese, to the pessimist and the incomplete. The bright colours and cute characters tie it down as a kids game, but the storyline is surprisingly dark and delve into areas I’ve never seen videogames venture. It’s something everyone should play, but one which very few have.
We started walking home around 6pm. We were still making jokes about labour, I was still convinced that I wasn’t going to have a baby until at least that time tomorrow. Sazz and I sewed together some wheat bags to be used as heat packs during labour “when it started” LOL. And we made the girls each a mini wheat bag too, since they were interested in them.

Because of a mild winter in most of the country predictions are that it will be a banner year for fleas and ticks. I know that where we are (Oklahoma) we did not get cold enough-long enough to kill fleas and ticks outside. As if I needed to have a reminder of how bad a flea and tick season it will be, while I was writing today I saw a tick crawling on my laptop. This year I am taking the offensive on this problem. You see we have three wonderful dogs and a really cute kitty.

Perry joined a list of crooners who became synonymous with Christmas such as Bing Crosby and Andy Williams. In a way, Perry and Andy share a sort of commonality in that they both discovered musical acts and had them on their show. In Perry's case, he very much liked Richard and Karen Carpenter. In fact, on their album "Christmas Portrait", Richard and Karen did a version of "Christ is Born", a staple of Perry's christmas carols.

A third 'party' then assured us that he had himself only missed catching that very train by half a minute; which fact he seemed to look upon rather in the light of a loss than an advantage, and proceeded to explain that he had acquired, by constant practice, a habit of being generally late for every train, in consequence of having travelled many years on the Slocum and Dragwell line, where no train ever came in until about an hour and a half after it was due, except on one occasion, when it ran down and killed two bullocks by way of asserting its independence.

to the wild set of study questions in “XX.” about bees, we can see and laugh at the encyclopedia’s efforts to teach even as we learn about their more pernicious aspects in the image given of an Abyssinia looked at from the white world in “I.” “VI.” gives a serious critique of arithmetical calculations even as it makes us laugh; it asks:
There are definitly more true white shades in this example. The way that I accieved the whitest looking whites (for example the lowest ruffle and the leggings) was done using v0000 b60 and a blending pen. B60 is my secret wepon--it is a very pale grey-blue that does shadows beautifully. I took my v0000 and colored the wrinkles in, then took my b60 and lightly inked in the darkest areas of the wrinkle. I gently went over it again with my v0000 and then I took my blending pen and blended it out to white. Obviously, you want to leave a lot of uncolored areas to get a true white look. It's best to err on the side of not enough colored then too much colored.
The most amazing thing was learning first hand how to be a fair and accurate reporter from the man who founded this newspaper in 1930. His name was Horace V. Wells and he was incredible. For example, when the city’s high school was integrated, it was the first in the state to do so. He was in favor of integration and told people if they didn’t like what he said about it, they should start their own paper.
I admit it will mostly be used for the gun season, but it is versatile enough for bow hunting. And it will allow for bow hunting later in the season. There are other stand locations on the property that I usually bow hunt. Two adults can hunt in comfort with room for a child as well. I may write an update with more detailed pics after the next time I go. And this didn’t cost me much to build. Many of the materials were leftover from other house projects. Many were from friends and family. The remaining needed materials I found at the ‘Restore’ (The Habitat for Humanity resale store). In the end, it’s a wooden blind with vinyl siding and steel roof. It’s properly flashed, sealed, and carpeted. Gun deer season 2011 came and I gave the blind it’s first run with my sister-in-law. We sat back to back with a Buddy heater between us, warming our backsides. An hour into opening day, a forkhorn buck strolled to within 10 yards and pretty much asked to be put in my freezer. Happy to oblige. So I’d say the blind is a success. My father-in-law calls it the Taj Mahal. I said, “Nothing but the best for your daughters and granddaughters”. Not to mention your favorite son-in-law. But I know that soon after my girls start hunting, I will be forced back to my treestand. I’ll start gathering more materials now.

Greenwich still remains stuck to the bottom three in London though, with only Waltham Forest and Islington performing worse and it is still scoring below the national average, albeit only just. The Greenwich rush by many parents to send kids to Bexley, go private if it can be afforded, or move out to Kent at secondary transfer time is the inevitable consequence of this performance. In addition the banding policy penalises bright children as well as those who are less academically able, by asking parents to send their brighter kids to the failing schools. In the real world, as opposed to the theoretical la-la land of educational thinkers of the 1960′s, this means that the brighter kids end up going elsewhere, leaving the failing school to get worse. It is no wonder that there has been such an enthusiastic welcome given to the Greenwich Free School, even from a Labour peer! http://www.newstatesman.com/education/2012/03/free-schools-labour-academies

“The time has come to move forward. The primary issue is how we live as a community at Duke-- how we behave toward each other, the values we espouse, the rules we pledge to uphold in our interactions. Now is the time to turn what has been a time of crisis into an opportunity for constructive change-to help make Duke a model of mutual respect and caring. Whatever happened at the lacrosse party last spring, three facts remain undisputed: racial epithets were used; a Duke student group hired two female strippers for the entertainment of young men; and underage drinking was encouraged. In the ensuing months, we have heard our students grapple with these and related issues that reflect patterns of behavior found, not only on our campus, but-according to colleagues elsewhere-at our peer institutions as well.”

The above idea didn't come from the Master Of Puppets CD, but from the original Kill Em' All vinyl. I was looking for a way to make use of some negative space, and I thought, why not a cool quote like "BANG THE HEAD THAT DOESN'T BANG." No one around me has said anything THAT cool lately, or if they have, no one's been sober enough to document it. So, deperately in need of content for my design, I pulled a pretty bad-ass quote from the Hazzard's Cure lyrics. "The wrath of a savage empire is at hand..." Raaaarrrgghhh!!!!!!!

OK concentrate this time, drink, damn that’s good. OK that’s enough spacing out, write something down, drink, holy crap that’s really good.

But not in August or half of September. The in-laws are headed to Greece. I'm happy for them. I'm sad for us. As we made preparations for their upcoming trip, such as alternate child care plans, looking after their home, etc. another though dawned on me. I will be cooking SEVEN nights a week while they are gone, rather than my usual five. I needed a plan. A plan that would actually work and that I wouldn't have to spend hours developing. There had to be a simpler answer. So I turned to (where else) the internet and my fellow bloggers. I reviewed several meal plan sites of varying costs and complexities. None quite seemed to be the answer.

Yikes, we have a 28 ft moving trailer parked in our front yard… This is beginning to get scary. All I’ve been able to think about is…
I consider myself an entrepreneur at heart. I have always wanted to start a company of some kind. It was not until the mid 90’s, when I started reading about internet companies raising VC money and going public making the founders millionaires. I liked that idea, so I started my first internet company in 1998 and was able to raise several millions of dollars in VC money within the first 3 months. I will tell you more about that venture some other day. Fast forward to 2008, I had dinner with a friend and fraternity brother. He had bought the name eRollover.com some time ago and was sitting on the name trying to come up with a good business model to use the name. During dinner that evening, I had asked him what he did with eRollover.com, because I had some ideas around starting a company in the financial services sector. He said, he was not using the name, so that evening; I hatched the idea to start eRollover.com. I wrote a quick 1 pager as to what eRollover was to be and how it would make money. The next morning I had breakfast with my friend and new business partner. I proposed a partnership deal. Finding a business partner you trust and can work well with is one of the hardest parts to starting a company. I had struck gold because Mike was all of that plus more. He would not let anything slip; he always put 150% in to any project. We used the eRollover name and put the business plan I had written into action. We split responsibilities and started executing. My whole plan was to build a great company with rich content, great features and an A grade management team. I knew I wanted to raise VC money, but wanted to prove the business model first.

Recorded in 1975, this is arguably my favourite track from this score and this version, the Unicorn-Kanchana release of the National Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of the composer himself, is my favourite. The low, repetitive strings with the dramatic cellos coming in when they do…I remember many a time just spending a few minutes with the 45 second cue on repeat. Watching a Hermann documentary on DVD recently I think the muting of the strings is what comes out particularly strongly on this version that catches my ear.

Dead City sees Graham straining at the very top of his range over a thrillingly driving rhythm carried along but a great fuzzy bassline that Peter Hook in his Joy Division pomp would have been proud of; Indeed, Joy Division/ New Order and Depeche Mode are reference points that can be heard throughout the record. The symphonic electronic rock of Another Bed could almost be a lost Depeche Mode track and those soaring analogue synths are once again to the fore in Don’t Look At Me. Fortunately, the immense power of The Twilight Sad’s music ensures that these forays into 1980s inspired electronic sounds never lapse into mere pastiche.

And didja know there's an International Checkers Hall of Fame? Me neither. But there is, and it's located in Petal, Mississippi, where they actually hold international competitions. Son of a gun. Guess there must be a lot more to the game than I ever thought.
As I’ve said before, the United States has not come here to claim resources or to claim territory. We came with a very clear mission: We came to destroy al Qaeda. And we have enormous respect for Afghan sovereignty and the dignity of the Afghan people. Together, we’re now committed to replacing war with peace and pursuing a more hopeful future as equal partners.
The first stop on the tour is Abbey Street/Lower O’Connell Street. On O’Connell street is one of the most famous buildings in Ireland, the General Post Office or G.P.O. The G.P.O. was the headquarters of the Easter Rising in 1916. It was here that Pádraig (Patrick) Pearse issued his declaration for Irish Home Rule. The interior of the building was destroyed when the British shelled the building trying to oust the rebels.
Nobody told Kirby to lie down & die, so he didn’t. Kirby is living his nature, which is to have fun and be a chick magnet for every girl walking by, including my 5yr old daughter. Joy is all this dog knows; he is beautiful in all his glory. This little dog is truly the meaning of the underdog; he is "Grace in action.”
Atticus and I watch this one together. I'm a Jason Isaacs fan, so it had me at " ... starring Jason Isaacs" but I love the premise and so far love the execution. The last two episodes slowed down a bit for me, though, and I'm not sure they can sustain what they've started, but I'm enjoying watching it unfold.
I got my first diary when I was a little girl. It had this ridiculous "lock" on it that made me feel so cool. Hahaha! I'm sure that lock never prevented my little sister from reading all of my 8 year old secrets. ;) I've been writing in a journal for a very long time. I probably have over 25 journals full of my thoughts, worries, celebrations and hopes. Journaling is kind of like blogging, they are both very therapeutic for me. Something about writing makes me feel better.

And most importantly, there’s a certain kind of drudgery often associated with working your way down a reading list and I’m most keen to avoid that in these discussions. One of the most important things we can do as human beings is to learn to read for pleasure. (I say that for personal, social and theological reasons, all of which I’ll try to flesh out some other time.) Christopher Hitchens said it well in speaking of his childhood reading habits: “I suspect that it doesn’t very much matter what one reads in the early years, once one has acquired the essential ability to read for pleasure alone.” So in reading these authors, don’t trap yourself with unrealistic expectations or burden yourself with unreasonable reading lists. Read what you like. Indeed, that was one of Lewis and Tolkien’s core rules for their own reading and one they commended to anyone who would listen. (One of Lewis’ final works, An Experiment in Criticism, has a lengthy passage railing against precisely this sort of read-to-the-list mentality.)
Maybe I'm being irrational. But I'll leave launching myself into the Facebook ocean as late as possible.
I understand the whole “giving back to the community” bit but isn’t it just a little played out and clichéd? I mean everyone says the same thing. Are there really that many moral people in the world? I thought society was getting worse, not better. Isn’t EVERYONE just out for number one? It is nice to think that there really are a lot of people out there who have awesome character and just morals. Those who want to do good to and for their fellow humans no matter where they are from.
About 30 meters from the second shelter, the track ends. The Punggol Park Connector, when completed, will connects with the Park Connector at the Serangoon River. So all the parks will be a continuous track from one estate to the other. I look forward to see that.
"It is remarkable that almost 50 years ago, the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy had the foresight to sponsor a symposium on the subject of comic books. After reviewing the comments in this symposium, I am struck by two things: how much times have changed, and how the present reflects the past."
I was supermom. I did all the things you are supposed to do as a mother — except a hundred times more. I sacrificed so my kids could have a great life. One problem — I was married to an abusive man. After years of being unhappy, depressed, isolated and alone, I finally left the marriage to save myself. But the abuse got worse, this time through the court system. My ex even went to the state supreme court to keep our children from attending their school. I tried everything I could to make it better. Finally, I did what hardly anyone has the courage to do. I went against what society says to do, but I listened to my heart. I stepped back so my children’s father could step up and be a better man. I moved 3000 miles away so my kids would have one home. I sacrificed being with the people I love most in the world — my children — so they could have a better life.
no matter the racing of my heart.

Klean Kanteen. I do prefer the sport cap top. I will spill it all over myself if I don't have one. I swear, every time. The kids each have one. Rowan actually has the sippy cup lid. He could easily handle the sports cap, which Em has, but he likes to dump things out so he's stuck with the sippy lid. The source link is to Amazon where I've gotten them before, but the actual Klean Kanteen site is pretty cool.

I agree with most of the list–it’s impossible not to include the Alhambra on any “7 Wonders of Spain” list. I’ve been twice myself and honestly, it’s one of those places in Spain you should not miss. However I think the Old City in Salamanca deserves a place on it or some honorable mention. I’ve been twice now and I know for me, it is definitely one of the most beautiful places I’ve been to in Spain.
The song really has nothing to do with the sexy TV movie host Elvira, host of the syndicated Movie Macabre television show. They simply share the same name. But, if you are one of Elvira's many fans, you probably think of her when you hear the song. But just how much do you know about the Mistress of the Dark?
"Sirens of Titan" was first published in 1959 and since then has been nominated for a Hugo Award and hailed as a beloved classic. "Sirens of Titan" cuts with satirical wit at humanity's follies, the belief of a divine hand guiding the individual, while at the same time cherish free will. Throughout the whole novel, Vonnegut takes a stab at omniscience and religion, the purpose of humanity and the deconstruction of the family unit.

The creation of a new ice cream flavour follows a pattern in my house. I have full cream milk and cream in my fridge for some reason (which I dont normally have - usually hilo and NO cream!), and there will be some pantry items or fruit which need using. This time I had a lemon, and this worked nicely with the theme for this months Sweet Adventures Blog Hop being lemons! I assumed there would be many lemony cakes, curds and tarts so I didn't want to go down that road. Ice cream it would be! I then had a thought of including basil in with the lemon - I must have seen it somewhere before and subconsciously remembered it, but I thought that would be something a little different!

And so, in a sense, I welcome the likes of Joan Smith and Jonathan Waxman for finally coming clean and alerting us all about what is afoot.Yes, but I think they should also be welcomed simply for reaching these insane levels of wanting to regulate popcorn intake and put health warnings on bangers and mash (also a wank fantasy of another a revolting authoritarian cunt - the aforementioned Waxman - and also fisked at VG,IF). If something is going to derail their plans, if something is going to halt the marching of those nasty little boots, then it could well be when the owners of those boots strap them onto a surfboard before going and jumping a shark.
We went back at 20 weeks (almost 21) for anatomy scan and everything looked really good and Chris really got to see the turtle and that's when it really hit him that he is going to have a son. He is just over the moon, it's so cute. Cervix was still measuring 3.5 cm so, so far so good.
The CSO index is a monthly residential property price index. Irelanddoes not yet have a publicly available register of actual sale prices, but one is expected in late 2012 following the passing of legislation this – read the latest on the House Price Register here. There are four other residential price surveys, based on advertised asking prices or agent valuations (see below, details here) – Phil Hogan’s Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government produces an index based on mortgage transactions, six months after the period end and not hedonically analysed – it is next to useless.

And what about the chance for authors to reach out to their readership unhindered by their relative importance or unimportance in their publishers marketing and publicity priorities – the freedoms social networks offer to authors large and small in profile. It’s an inevitable fact that publishers can only focus on publication – and then they move on to the books in the next publication round. In very real ways, the author can support now through the entire life of a book – and keep it alive, keep readers interested in it. That’s most definitely good ….

We spent the rest of Friday shopping and then went into Greenwich Village for dinner. Kelly's favorite restaurant in the City is Sushi Samba in the Village so that's where our reservations were. It was so yummy! After dinner, we walked around the village and had a few more drinks then headed back Uptown to the Waldorf.

I went to pack up our stuff,
The ants had gone berserk. Those that weren't curled up, or in the throws of death, were rushing around or fighting with other ants. The stuff was working, so I went about my business of eradicating ants around the yard. After about ten mounds, I couldn't find any others, so I went back to the first to see if the effect was only temporary and the ants were recovering.
Now for the first thing. Clean children who have become practically feral over the summer.

I was a nervous wreck for a week leading up to the test! I am happy with my new career! It has been a big change, but I love it! Best of all, I work in a Christian office with Christian people!

To change this vexing dynamic, consumers must be able to substitute for petroleum by purchasing competing fuels, like alcohol fuels, biodiesel, natural gas or electricity, if they are less costly on a per mile basis. But as long as our vehicles are able to run on nothing but oil, keeping oil monarchs on their throne will remain our national side job.
Many films purport to tell the "story of a relationship," often using various techniques to fracture their narratives in order to convey something of the complexity we all feel to be fundamental to relationships. But these films often fail because of their need to come down, finally, and make some sort of definitive statement about the relationship, usually either naively hopeful or nihilistically cynical. These films cause us to become invested in relationships as plots and dramatic narratives, as though we were watching diplomatic negotiations between states: "Will they or won't they...?" We are denied this in Certified Copy: we cannot hope for any specific outcome to Shimell and Binoche's relationship because we cannot with any precision say what the nature of this relationship actually is.

It now remains for the U.S. government to set a sensible example to the world by offering a bonus or yearly pension to all obviously unfit parents who allow themselves to be sterilized by harmless and scientific means. In this way the moron and the diseased would have no posterity to inherit their unhappy condition. The number of the feeble-minded would decrease and a heavy burden would be lifted from the shoulders of the fit.Margaret Sanger, “The Function of Sterilization,” The Birth Control Review, October 1926, 299
The challenge here is going to be to really break that character open and let the readers see her as she is, not how she wants to appear. That's the main focus of my reread right now. And I think that if I nail that in the rewrites, my MS is going to be so, so much better.

This is still another area that astonishes me. This is the POD publisher’s open doorway. This should be about the candle in the window, the lick of fresh paint every few years, a few books here or there. Yet, it’s sometimes the area of a POD publisher’s business which is the weakest. I have seen it all, bad links, gaudy colours, grammatical mistakes on their welcome page! Not a friggin’ book in sight! No updates on the site for months on end, doesn’t anything change in your world? What the hell are you guys trying to say to any perspective authors? I have to put my hand up here. This is the weakest point for my own publishers. It’s no wonder the traditional publishing world turns their noses up at all of you.

As I wrote yesterday, a reduction to 528,000 square feet would be a more than 40% cut in bulk, while the height of the building was (seemingly) reduced only 18%, from 620 feet to 511 feet. Include the hotel and the cut in bulk is less than 24%. Maybe the building is getting a little shorter, too.

The Poem Hunter is a grab bag of good and bad selections. Today's choice, A Song, brings you up short. You realize that Whitman's expansive hope for America was in vain. “Comrade” has been so contaminated by events that lay in the future beyond Whitman's brief span, that we, the inheritors of his work, cannot use the word anymore without irony. Amazing to contemplate the evil done in the name of comradeship in the 20th century.

Again, as in so much else, what is presented as “diversity” is no such thing, it is a new set of rules, and those rules only go one way. A mixed race society is supposed to be the panacea for the alleged evils of racism, but whenever a torch is shone too brightly on the xenophobia and racism within the non-white community, it is invariably far more violent, bigoted and visceral than that exhibited by the whites. As the multicultural marketeers have not yet resolved that dilemma, they choose not shine their torches on it or provoke unwanted displays of real life diversity.
Throughout the rest of the 1980s I made my yearly pilgrimage to the Tu-Lane Truck Stop. Fortunately we were in Kitchener every year so I was able to have that chili several times in that decade.

I’m definitely past the point of thinking of my primary, immediate family as myself and my sister/parents. Now it has shifted to what is best for me, my wife, and our children. It is better for us to live here. Laws protect us here as lesbian women, as home educators, etc. Our lifestyle here matches what we want – to move to Country A would require massive rejigging of how we conceive of our family as working.

ATRI also considered “effective enforcement countermeasures” – namely those states that issued more tickets got fewer crashes. It makes sense to consider that states who are “tough” on enforcement would get fewer crashes. It’s also tough on those drivers who are being pushed by dispatch or managers to “bend rules” to increase productivity.

Located next to the famous City Lights bookstore, owned by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Vesuvio is an elaborate dark wood Victorian 2 level bar made famous as a drinking hole for the Beats. It’s a great place to people-watch and imagine times gone by when it was frequented by these bohemian literary types. We drank Sierra Nevada on draft, and Lagunitas IPA from a bottle, 5.7&. Lagunitas brewery is based in Petaluma, California, where we somehow ended up after getting lost on Highway 1 (how can you get lost on Highway 1?! That’s another story). I wanted to try Lagunitas IPA as I heard that it was brewed with about 43 varieties of hops. I think the brewery are probably messing with us when they say that, but who am I to say? It was certainly hoppy but I got a hint of pear which I didn’t enjoy too much, so it wasn’t my favourite beer. It may have tasted different if I had managed to get it on tap.
The Brooklyn Detention Center will house men arrested for mid-level felonies and misdemeanors, who aren't able to post bail before they go to trial, or while they wait to be offered a plea. So, no murderers. Most inmates stay sixty to ninety days. Only one person in the shower cell at a time.

On the whole, the analysis of Alice’s underground adventures conforms to the Jungian idea of a collective unconscious where the conventional rules of space and time no longer apply. And like Jung’s work, the concepts of magical, mystical and The Holy are not as clearly delineated as some might hope for.
One basic test involves having a group of participants that are aware of all related goals – and one participant that has no knowledge that they are part of a test. The group is then given a series of questions and scenarios and asked to decide, as a group the right or best answer. The questions range from the basic – such as identifying the straightest line, from a set of lines to more complicated moral / ethical questions involving appropriate treatment of human beings under certain conditions. Those aware of the effort being a test are in collusion to agree collectively on wrong answers. The unwitting participant begins the process by offering a few disagreeing answers. The group then applies pressure on the unwitting participant, in ways from eye rolls to sighs to small negative comments made about their abilities of perception. As the test progresses, pressure to conform is maintained. The unwitting participant invariably begins to determine what the collective view is before answering so as to match the group’s perceptions. Even as the questions become more intricate involving moral / ethical issues … this same soul will most often look to understand what the collective view is before taking a position; and most often will then simply agree with the group. These tests demonstrate the same percentage of similar responses regardless of the tester’s gender, intelligence, or socioeconomic standing. In other words … most will succumb to such pressure with time.

Bakker himself worked as a subtitler on nature films before training as a gardener but has been writing for many years beginning with children's fiction. He is not the product of a creative writing course or degree in literature and I can't help but wonder if that and his clear connection to nature is fundamental to this novel's success and in some way. The prose is pared back to the bone, its simplicity a stylistic statement in itself, and this helps to make the daily descriptions of the rural life of its protagonist and the Dutch countryside that surrounds him attain a poetic beauty whilst not having any kind of obvious poetic flourishes.

Overall, there are a fair number of other fine craft beer joints in the Hollywood area of LA (Mowhawk Bend also comes highly recommended), and although this city still lags behind many other US destinations in this regard, it is certainly way ahead in a great many others, and the sooner this famous town has as many such bars as it merits the better. In the meantime I'd say it needs to fight as hard as it can to keep the excellent ones it already has.

What Paul recognised, however, is that it’s a part of him. He can’t get rid of it; it’s just there. This leads him to say in verse 21 that he believes it is a law that when he wants to do right, he does evil instead. Paul is being incredibly honest here. He’s essentially saying ‘I can do no right on my own.’ He’s affirming that sin is inherent in us; so inherent, that it can be referred to as a law.

He blames the entire housing crisis on Wall Street greed, and the only thing he says is that the government should have had more regulation. He learned nothing. It is the complete opposite.

Wishful thinking on the part of the disciples is highly unlikely even in light of their initial hopefulness and enthusiasm. But, they were not easily convinced as Christ had to scold them on their faith. In fact, they came into the appearances not wishfully hoping to see Christ, but disbelieving those who did. Saint Thomas is the best example. He demanded evidence, which Christ gave to him. Further, wishful thinking would not stand up in the threats of death and all the trials and tribulations that they later had to face.

I hope this is something my family and friends can still be proud of.
I also suspect that to make an honor code really stick, you have to trust your students enough to let them be the enforcers -- and I'm not sure anyone at my institution does. (Misnomer U. began as an old-school Southern ladies' university, you see, a heritage that comes with a strong tradition of in loco parentis. While both of my alma maters have had a student-administered honor court since time out of mind, I can't really imagine the young ladies of prior generations at Misnomer being allowed to run anything of the sort, given everything else I've heard about the Old Days. And the paternalistic attitude still persists, even after coeducation; I was rather shocked, in my first year, to learn that dorms here have curfews.)
Every time I have needed to go to downtown for anything, I have usually found a way around it. I get panicky. I get sick. I find some way to do what I need to do online or through a friend. But I needed to face down this fear.
So I did. And I have no idea how late the bats stayed up. But the cave was empty this morning, so I assume they have all found a place to "hang" for the night.
It isn’t strictly necessary to do this, but if you follow my suggestion, you will find the animation work that comes next much easier to follow. Also, if you want, you can make more parts for the hangman: the one used in this lesson is made up of nine parts, which allows the player to make nine errors before the game is over. But I will leave that up to you — decide the level of difficulty that you want to make for this game, and then draw the figure accordingly.
Introduction: I wrote the novel Aksinya: Enchantment and the Daemon. This was my 21st novel, and on this blog, I gave you the entire novel in installments that included commentary on the writing. In the commentary, in addition to other general information on writing, I explained, how the novel was constructed, the metaphors and symbols in it, the writing techniques and tricks I used, and the way I built the scenes. You can look back through this blog and read the entire novel.

The Jets and Giants are struggling, Rex Ryan was fined $75,000 for cursing at a fan and the playoff picture is slowly but surely molding out right now.

Is it any wonder that the PLCB is such a second-rate purveyor of booze? It's like Wang Chi says in Big Trouble in Little China: "My mind and my spirit are going north and south!" On the one hand, the PLCB is supposed to be making sure that Pennsylvanians don't drink booze in any illegal (or immoral) ways, or drink too much of it, or drink it before they're of legal age, or buy it without paying the full load of taxes. But on the other hand, the PLCB sells all the wine and liquor in the state (except for the small amount sold at Pennsylvania's wineries), and the more they sell, the more money they can give to the state (and insure their continued job survival).
Imagine the world as it is now, there are two possibilities right now, you can continue to read this blog, or you can log off (which would be very rude) There will be one universe where you log off, this is universe A, and one where you continue reading, universe B. Now there are two ‘parallel’ universes. There will now be two choices in universe A, you decide to log back on, because you realize how rude what you did was, and one where you stay logged off. in universe B, you have two choices, you stay logged on because this is completely riveting stuff, and one where you do finally log off.
Ah, mother's day what a wonderful day to celebrate the ones who give us life. And what better way to celebrate than a day NOT seeing my children. :) HA! For us young moms everyday is mother's day, I was ready for a day off. And that is exactly what I got! I loved it.
This is REALLY how I view the Super Bowl every year. I don't hate football, but I do love eating ridiculous foods that I only feel justified in making a few times a year, as well as watching funny commercials. I am more than willing to put up with the football part of the event to reap the joy of these two SUPER bonuses.

This time around, with baby #2, I am handling things a bit differently and I am in LOVE with it. I am using the Lact-Aid Nursing System. I used this with baby #1 and it was a DISASTER (in fact, my 3-month old, while wrestling with a latch, grabbed the Lact-Aid bag, threw it, and it somehow came apart and spilled all over my brand new laptop). This time around, I had a friend come over and give me her tips on using the Lact-Aid. She breastfed her babies for at least 14 months (some even longer) with this system. She gave me some great tips and I am passing them on to you (with a few more I have figured out).
More opinion from me: It's strange to see Fernandez as a rookie. He played for so long in the majors and was such a presence for a variety of high-profile teams and moments. But Fernandez didn't hold a regular job in the majors until the year of this set, 1985.

So he gained a PhD with a thesis attacking the Met on racism, while in 2007 he wrote an autobiographical book called Not One Of Us, which contained severe criticism of the Met.

The American people have been brutalized by this bunch for over three years now, and our tolerance level for Obama’s brand of acrimony is very thin. In a previous article, I explained that “walking into the backblast” is a term we used in the Marine Corps for doing something really stupid and careless. We had several weapons that used the back blast of the weapon to reduce recoil. Standing in the ‘blast cone’ could be a very dicey experience… and one you’d not be likely to repeat.
Raise your hand if you think this is going to be ironic in a few years: My first post about contemplating motherhood is the product of a nightmare involving the anti-christ.
Romney needs to underscore Mr. Obama’s policy failures with the fact that the president is a committed left-winger, which contradicts Mr. Obama’s stated moderation in 2008. Doing so bypasses Mr. Obama’s likeability by damning the president with his own words and actions. Mr. Obama’s immoderation is the central reason for the ObamaCare fiasco and a floundering economy.

Although his work fits in well with today's 'all new' comic scene, in the 70's his stuff must have been nothing short of revolutionary. At that time the comic industry really was all "superheroes and kids". There were a handful of people around making adult oriented comics (the aforementioned Robert Crumb, Gilbert Shelton with his Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers), but these were mainly "adult" because of their explicit content.
I started by placing 4 post-it notes in a square in the corner before stamping the flower. This is called masking, making it so part of the area where you are stamping doesn't get the ink on it. I also used the "Rock and Roll" technique on the flower by inking it up with Daffodil Delight ink and then rolling the outer edges of the flower stamp in Pumpkin Pie ink. This gives it dimension without much trouble at all!
Pipes also iterates (ibid) the case of Rashid Baz, a Lebanese cab driver who drove around New York in March 1994, looking for Jews to kill. He fired at a van full of Hassidic boys, and killed one of them. The FBI classified this as “road rage.”

I looked for MONTHS for just the right piece of furniture to put our tv on. In the past, we used an armoire that we loved a lot (and that I was really proud of getting at a garage sale for only $40) that was a perfect fit for our thick old non-flat tv. But before we moved to Colorado, we gave away the tv knowing we would bite the bullet and buy our very first flat screen.
Things are not perfect, but we are all much happier today than we were this time last week.

I really do like writing, I haven’t written a story for a long time but even when I write for assignments I get the itch to continue working on a something I have buried on my desktop. I like adding characters halfway through stories, or having plot lines merge together when the reader thinks they know the ending already. I try to write stories I want to read. Most of my story ideas come from daydreams. Sometimes things that happen to me personally spawn other possible outcomes that I think would make a great story. I like to stretch ideas and themes until the only place they could possibly happen are in a novel.

It will sustain me through, well, anything. This moment right now and the many like it, is what I will reach for when things are rough, as proof of how well things can be.

The pathway leads to a very secluded house that a great Aunt of mine once used to look after. It’s set back from the road and the only access route is through the river pictured, or across several very narrow almost ‘homemade’ bridges. I remember as a child that I used to grip the chair in the car and scream when we drove over the bridges, I was terrified that they were going to break.
I think people are scared of natural because it doesn’t seem as “self-sacrificing” — like the Catholic priest who feels his life of sexual restriction is “more holy” than a family-life. Or a Buddhist who would run away to “find himself” on a mountain top, leaving anything “worldly” behind. Or the monogamist who would insist that a polygamist ought to “deny their natural man” and get with one-on-one monogamy instead of a natural state of polygamous families.
When Barbara turned back to her husband, she was smiling.
When I saw the “chainsaw” sign in the Junk Woods, all I changed was the name and number. That was too good not to use. I needed Allie to be connected to the priest in the woods, and maybe to whoever wrote that sign, and all those pieces fell in place. I wanted to have dogs play a major role in the story because dogs are so important to me. The rest was making it all fit together.
Now, sunsuits were different than bathing suits. Sunsuits were play clothes, made of a light cotton. Mine were tied at the shoulders, gathered at the waist and had elastic at the legs. It was a bathing suit, but not really.

It was curiosity that got me to meet Gen Kelsang Losal. Oh, I had read about sitting meditation. I was well versed in the theory behind it. The application of this theorem was a horse of another color. Often, I have said my mind does not shut off, and the whitenoise and psychobabble would continue when I was focusing on the sensation of breath and trying to skinny-dip in Nirvana.

For the stems/leaves, I used the Heartfelt Creations "Simple Fillers Stems PreCut set" (HCPC3319). I love this stamp set because you can use it for the stems for most your flowers. I used both the stems with leaves and the stem without leaves. The stamped image was then die cut using the Spellbinders "Label 25" die. You notice part of the design has been cut off. That will be "fixed" in the next photo. I embossed this piece using the "Swiss Dots" embossing Folder.

We are talking about England here – Leicester. However, the chairman and rector of the Islamic Foundation is also the vice president of the Jamaat al-Islami opposition party in Pakistan. And this too has total sharia law as its mission. That is, the turning of Pakistan into a complete sharia state – an Islamic state.

The dialogue is unimaginative and far too frequent. At some points it felt like the author had originally wanted to write a screenplay but decided on a novel at the last minute. The character of Catherine Laurence only seems to have been included in the novel to serve as a romantic interest for the protagonist and the romance does not seem to add anything to the story at all. If it had been removed, it would have been a touching story about a man searching for his daughter. As a result, instead, we have a story about a man searching for his daughter with a woman he has arbitrarily decided is the love of his life despite the fact that they have little interaction with each other before making this decision. The plot seems to have been conceived in post 9-11 fear, under the impression that all Arabs are terrorists, the French must be in league with them since they did not immediately join our side in the war (think Freedom Fries mentality here), all Romas are scheming bastards who seem to only be in the story to be killed off, and all Americans are well-built, sensitive, but with a give them hell attitude. The characters are so full of cliché that it’s absolutely impossible to take any of them seriously. The female writer who writes sex tip articles and makes her way around Europe by sleeping with wealthy men has Daddy issues? Please.
We all need a first chance to get a story published and we've all been there. This series will be the students first steps into the writing world and I'm very honoured to be part of it.

And all I own is a deep remorse.
The thing is, I expected it to be outside, and not knowing what floor there would be, I brought my oldest, plain black shoes with rather low heels which I only wear to classes and outside milongas with rough floor... And I forgot that, in a place where people don´t know you and don´t have a clue whether you are a good dancer or not, the only chance of getting invited by good leaders is to wear your flashiest shoes...and watching all these girls with extravagant Neo-tango and Comme Il Faut shoes I was cursing myself for leaving my lovely favourite pale-pink-satin-and-black-lace Comme Il Fauts at home... oh well.
Dinner was chicken stir fry, and it was something I made. The observation about it was one of the things I dislike about doing thermos for food, is that the vegetables continue to cook. By the time you open the thermos they tend to pale in comparison to what they used to look like. They tend to be a dull lackluster color, and don’t look as appetizing. I like COLOR in my food.

Yes it is still a chilly spring on the mountain. In the last 10 days we have had 7 feet of snow in the cascade mountains. Living in the foothills of Mt Hood at 1500 feet we have been lucky and only got a dusty of snow each morning. But the cold days have made me get out my soup pot and make a pot of Turkey Chili. One of my family's favorite this is a great chili to make a large pot of and put some in the freezer. I have been making this recipe for about 10 years and had been buying cans of great northern beans for the chili. After watching an episode on the History channel on dried beans I though why was I not using dried beans like my grandmother did. I would save 1/4 the cost using dried beans and all I had to do was to be patience and soak them overnight. So from a little bag of beans I have a big pot of chili.

Ah, humility. It's a hard thing to learn, isn't it?
One real anomaly, which intruded into astronomy in the mid-19th century, concerned the orbit of the planet Uranus. We had a wonderful theory of how everything in the solar system moved, and could predict where all the known planets would be at future times with fantastic accuracy, using Newton’s law of gravitation. But Uranus wasn’t quite behaving. People had checked and double-checked the numbers, but the seventh planet was definitely wandering very slightly off course, if the information they were plugging into the calculations was right.
My point is, it’s a big deal, and it’s not easy. It’s a huge process that you have to be very personally involved in. Which brings us to…

Arguably, this turn in the political debate is a sign of how much trouble Labor is in. It is no longer trying to win over a majority and targeting the middle of the road swinging voters. It is trying to regain the confidence of its traditional base, and convince its core supporters that it hasn’t lost its Labor heart.
