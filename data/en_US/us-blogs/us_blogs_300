I immediately recognized one of the challenge bedding sets as the Poetical pattern by Barbara Barry. You see I've loved it since Jenny posted about it here. Little did I know it was offered in a bedding set at Macy's! (and guess who's in need of new bedding?)
I've decided to post a tiny bit from my upcoming novel, however this is still under revision and may change a bit from what I post here. The scene is one of many zombie POV situations that I include in my story, but let me be clear, the whole novel does not revolve around the zombie I am featuring here. She only represents one of the characters in my book, although she does play an important role to the story. And here it goes:
Gods are not distinct categories. Nor are they archetypes. They are shades of being like the way the pronunciation words “pen” and “pin” are the same in the American South, but not in Philadelphia. Whether they are or are not the same depends only on the scale with which you are measuring.
Jatt: It’s not like people overreact to these sorts of things or anything.

One thing I noticed while sitting in the same spot for a couple of hours was I became much more aware of my surroundings. I was picking up on little details that I hadn’t noticed at first. It certainly helped that the cell phone service was very spotty. That forced me to be present instead of messing around online.
I’m only at the beginning of my journey, but I feel ready… for my second day of training, for the next obstacle, and for life in general.
Ash Wednesday is really more of a Catholic thing, but in recent times, Evangelicals have been adopting the idea of Lent. We just don't tend to put ash on our foreheads. (Also, I am no historian, so I don't really know how long Evangelicals have been doing this. I do know that none of my churches growing up ever talked about Lent.) Last year, in a series of bad decisions, I decided to participate in the 40 Days of Water. I also decided to do the 30 for 30 Challenge and let Denise take a lot of pictures of my attempts at outfits. This lead to a day that (not exaggerating) I wandered around the mall crying. Because all I wanted was to wear something different and to drink something not water. (SO many links, guys! Click on them!)

Sneha smiled back at us and said, “Even I am from Guwahati…also, St. Mary’s batch 1999″.
Probably one of the most amazing things one can do in the Kruger National Park is to go on an early morning bushwalk. Admittedly this means rousing oneself at the ungodly hour of 04h30 in order to meet the guide at 05h15 and then facing an incredibly freezing drive in an open Landrover to the walking spot. Given it’s winter, temperatures are a bit extreme – down to about 2 degrees in the early morning (never mind the windchill factor), and up to over 30 degrees come midday.
We've lived in basically, and I say basically because it's actually 2 different apartments but they are in the same complex & have the same exact layout, since 1992. God, has it really been that long?!?! 20 years?!?! Can you see why I've been uninspired all this time? I was still in college when I moved in so I think I still see my apartment through 20 year old eyes. But not anymore! Consider me a changed woman. I'll be 40 in July and I think it's time that I start living in a grown up home.

Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

Uncle wanted a commitment to staying, but John yearned for his beloved.
Tonight we had burgers grilled outside in the cool evening, and we wanted something not to boozy: we're closing on our refinance in about 15 minutes. Blatant Session, at 3.9%, sounded perfect. Cathy's first sip put a smile on her face: "Oooo, that's yummy." It was a bit like Stone Levitation, but without the forward malt, and without quite as urgent a hop character. Tasty, bitter, good malt backbone, and very finishable.
I do, however, know the facts: that I read his “No Apologies” post, I saw how it could easily be misread, and I wrote a comment detailing that. He did not approve my comment. So I re-submitted it two days later. Again, he did not permit it to be posted. And so I tried once more. Again, he refused to post it.
I’m no great fan of Lord Protector Blair and his war policy – but, on this one, I can’t really see why the PM should not support a proposition or lobby for a policy to allow those who are creative (even if it does include someone he knows) from enjoying financial benefits for a longer period. We know there is a witch hunt for Blair – but this strikes me as trying to find trouble where there is no trouble. Well…at least it gave the Lib-Dem and Tory spokesmen something to say. If I was the ‘Umpire’ here – I would say “Not out”. I would not raise my index finger to signify dismissal on the facts as presented in The Telegraph article. I will, of course, declare a conflict of interest myself – as the organisation for which I write this blawg are publishers and course providers Consilio / The Legal Practitioner / LawinaBox. I do have some sympathy with protection of copyright. We get ripped off occasionally – but when SPR finds it, they do tend to act.

Studies quoted by Dr. Oz on Tuesday’s Oprah indicate that the average person “picks or touches” their nose about five times an hour. Of course, there’s a big difference between picking and touching, as coke addicts, I Dream of Jeannie and Santa headed up the chimney can attest.
I have been invited to the Pimm's Summer Party which is rather thrilling and happening tomorrow night! I am unsure of the wisdom of a garden party in March but a chance to start my yearly intake of Pimm's early is a chance I am not going to miss.

The summer always goes by more quickly than I would like it to, but right now it’s a great feeling sitting here with the whole summer in front of me. My boyfriend and I are finally going to be living in the same town and I love the thought of all the possibilies of how this summer will turn out.
Meanwhile, Bill was meeting with the four remaining sheriffs in Louisiana to decide what to do about Marnie. Pam came back over and expressed her desire to kill her, while accidently letting it slip that she not only knows where Eric is, but that she knows he has no memory. Bill forced her to tell him where Eric is hiding, and Pam did not try to lie. Looking hurt and angry, Bill rushed over to Sookie’s house. In true True Blood fashion, though, we won’t get to see that outcome until next week.
John and I have been swapping cards for over a year now. There's nothing really regular about it and hardly any correspondence. The only time either of us know that we're getting cards from each other is when they arrive at our door.

After that I changed gears a little, partially because the beer I wanted wasn't pouring properly, and ordered an Ithaca Caskazilla, a red ale.
Last Saturday Skamania Lodge hosted its third annual Cheers to Beers Fest on their front lawn. I went last year and had a blast despite the lousy weather. This year I was invited to return and fortunately the weather was amazing, but the fest was surprisingly subdued. The beer selection was great and I was delighted to see Snipes Mountain back as it is one of those favorites that is impossible to find locally. The beer based buffet dinner was once again great and the brunch is always a treat.
Inductive reasoning, also known as induction or inductive logic, is a kind of reasoning that constructs or evaluates propositions that are abstractions of observations. It is commonly construed as a form of reasoning that makes generalizations based on individual instances.

It's not a bad book. I enjoyed it mostly. I really like the characters, Ivy June and Catherine. They were likable, funny, and honest. I enjoyed reading about life in the eastern Kentucky mountains. What I didn't realize is that this book has a lot of coal mining in it. You see Ivy June's "Pappaw" is a coal miner, and that's fine. My husband is a coal miner. We are proud of coal miners!
This past Friday, Lee turned 30! I’ve been thinking about his birthday and planning something special for a LONG time. I’ve wanted to write a blog about it for a LONG time, but I had to wait until it had passed.
“Thornhill,” Arnen said the word slowly like it was the first time he had said it. A wry smile played around his mouth. “Your adoptive parents are clever people, James. I never would have imagined… Thornhill. You know, James, I think your parents will escape from Capria. Somehow, they always seem to find a way.”
I thought I needed you. I guess my thoughts lied, ‘cause…

Psychedelics or hallucinogens are mind-altering drugs capable of inducing distorted perceptions of thought, often including intense sensual input with diminished control of the induced experience. The experiences are commonly known as daydreams, hallucinations, and fantasies. These drugs have profound benefits based on research findings in the treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), alcoholism, cluster headaches, depression, and anxiety in dying patients.

Jesus it seems achieved both forms of freedom – the freedom of enlightenment and the freedom of one who is now unecumbered by the strictures of society (as someone who technically/officially no longer exists he can do anything).
So I guess you could say that more than all of them have germinated, or that I got greater than 100% germination rates on most of my plants. How’s that for some kickass logic?

People that are working at losing weight and belly fat should make sure that they eat a good and nutritional breakfast each morning to start the day. Fish, vegetables, dark chocolates and fruits are nutrition food to eat for people who are desirous of losing belly fat. They should make sure however to avoid foods that have a high level of saturated fat and sugar at all cost.
And Blue Skies from Pain: Night Shade trade paperback, March 2012, 359 pages, cover art by Min Yum. This is Stina Leicht's second book, a sequel to last year's Of Blood and Honey, which garnered very strong reviews for a first novel. Even though I didn't read the first book in the series, the reviews I saw and the fascinating premise of the series, that the strife in Northern Ireland in the 1970's was connected in part to a supernatural conflict involving the Catholic church, made this one look so interesting to me that I designated it one of our four seeded novels in the Battle of the Books.
The first hat that I will review is a blue hat. It is about six inches tall with a furry bit on the top. The furry bit is slightly darker than the rest of the hat, which is lighter than the furry bit. The blue is a very nice colour. This hat is a nice hat!
This photograph was taken from the balcony while the dancers were on stage beforehand, preparing and applying their makeup. This was an unexpected and fascinating part of the whole evening.

JC’s laptop was easy to fix, but the two older laptops required me to format their hard-drives and I had to re-install the operating system on each laptop; and then I had to start updating the operating system on each laptop, while trying to install a few programs.
So naturally, I was extremely nervous to tackle 30 "intermediate level" miles.
Our first big hill came about the 18-19K mark. I wasn’t sure how well I was doing on my time, and I continued to keep my eyes open for the boyfriend. I wasn’t sure how long he would make it given his ankle, but I was happy for him since I hadn’t seen him at all!

As I try to move on from one bad apple to a hopeful good apple, I had a random thought about someone I cared deeply for who is no longer in my life. It’s like 7 years of my friend, confidant and someone I could trust my life with? Gone. Over a change of heart that should not have had such bad complications but did. To this day I’ll see things and be reminded of him, hear a song and remember how much he (usually) hated it, or pick things out I know he loved. Granted things were not good on either side of that relationship but its sort of depressing to know I can’t even talk to him. I wish him nothing but happiness and if he thinks I’m a crazy one, that’s fine but the blaming goes full circle. Strange I thought of him the other day thinking what day it was and realizing his birthday is coming up.. my ipod played the song he despised out of all life that was my favorite, i found his old CD and my pin of his band.. Annoying! Not to mention he keeps effing appearing in my facebook and i have to see his face with his new gf. It’s like an annoying jab to make his presence known to me anyway possible that even his friends have pointed out to me, but I just have to ignore it. I hate when the past sneaks up in some random way when you just want to forget it and move forward.

We basically spent all Friday afternoon telling the movers where to put things and getting our washer and dryer and internet set up. (Oh yeah, I don't know if I mentioned this before or not but we've decided NOT to get cable TV...we did without it for a year in Ann Arbor, and we really want to try to be as active as possible while living here...so basically it's just going to be Hulu/Netflix from here on out...we'll see how this goes...) I did have the chance to do some driving around on Friday afternoon when I went to go pick up some lunch, and thankfully there are some stores really close to us! Also there are sidewalks and bike lanes EVERYWHERE so I could easily walk or bike to do errands which is something that I couldn't do in South Carolina. I was basically just driving around in awe of how behind all the normal suburban trappings like Home Depot and Red Robin, there are these beautiful snowy mountains! And my heart skipped a beat when I saw this...

I therefore contacted Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) for some details on the research project which resulted in arterolane. The reason I contacted MMV and not Ranbaxy is because MMV owns the patent for arterolane in India – IN 245779.
Basically, what they're doing is extending the campaign they launched last year, with Rik Mayall playing the Bombardier, drinking the beer and extolling its virtues with what Well's & Youngs clearly hope will become a pub catchphrase: 'Bang on!' They're going for a heavyweight promotion on Dave, the channel for blokes who like repeats of the programme Stewart Lee refers to as 'Mock the Weak'. Ten and fifteen second idents will frame peak time programmes. I haven't seen the idents because like I said, I wasn't invited to the launch, and didn't get to meet Rik Mayall, but the press release says 'viewers can expect to see the Bombardier's take on the English sense of humour, values, our love of pubs and our social habits.'

This one was a lucky find. I think it was labeled just "red typewriter" or some such, and only my obsessive investigation of all the new auctions allowed me to discover that it was our much-sought after Valentine. Not a great specimen of it at that - one ribbon spool cover was missing (giving the machine the appearance of having been caught mid-wink), and there were a few black marks on the body that we were not sure could be removed. Luckily, those buffed right out in the end.
I do get a ALCS payment and a PLR payment each year. Both are mainly to do with two books and yet I have over 30 in print. We were surveyed by ALCS here at the university last year.

The problem I have is that the product appears to be laden with sticker auto's. I understand Panini was originally a sticker company, but I don't want stickers on my trading cards. It's one thing to feature sticker auto's in a product or two in order to keep prices down, but it's another to have them in every product (aside from 2010 Panini Basketball HOF). The other issue has to do with the manufactured patches that consequently which renames the Contenders line to: Playoff Contenders Patches.

The kids were delighted to be back here in Monterey. For them it is a treat, pure and simple, and they are thrilled with the novelty of a trip away from home, tinged with the familiarity of a place we have been to before, a place of happy memories. It was a weekend of simple pleasures. Time with mummy and daddy. Motel beds to jump between, jellyfish to look at, sand to play in, french fries and waffles to eat. Sure, mummy and daddy spent part of an afternoon working in the hotel room fending off dive bombing bed bouncers, but all in all it made for a lovely family weekend. I'm fascinated that the kids have both hit that age when they will form permanent memories. Forty, fifty or more years from now they will still remember this motel room in Monterey, and these trips to the amazing aquarium, much as I remember the little hotel in Maidencombe with the swing in the garden and the too deep swimming pool, and the red sandy beaches of Torquay from the holidays of my childhood.
The question that may immediately came to my mind is: “why”? Why, with diet alone, are you more likely to put the weight back on? Another, possibly more important, question: is it healthy?

Come on guys, show us how you answered each question and let us compare those answers with your well-established records.
Barbara glanced down. It was purely reactionary, with no forethought whatsoever. Nathaniel’s crotch was a mere foot from her face. When she caught herself staring, she slapped both hands over her face in embarrassment. “Oh my God!” Nathaniel reared back and laughed.

Another thing that bothers me about the topic of abortion and children with disabilities is that of privacy. Women who have the information available to them to decide an abortion is best for them never have to make that decision public. And that's the way it should be. But for those of us who have children with disabilities or fatal illnesses or impairments of any kind, what happened to us, the decisions we did or didn't make, are de facto public. And we often bear the brunt of this debate: people in our community know who we are. And the public, scathing judgements we and our children are forced to endure as a result are entirely unfair. Just read the comments after Rapp's essay or any article about children with disabilities.

I dont think there will be many surprises, although there are ususally one or two. I predict those surprises could come if Hugo starts racking up the technical catgories… you might start to wonder if it has a shot at Best Picture. Seriously. I also think it could be a tighter race for Best Actress. We’ve seen Viola Davis and Meryl share the spotlight and trade wins all season. It’s possible that the Academy voted for the long shot, critical darling Michelle Williams (remember who the Acaemy voters are…). Those 3 all have a good shot at the BIG win.
Lynne Featherstone, the Equalities Minister has announced that religious groups will be permitted, if they wish, to host same-sex civil partnership ceremonies (src). The news will be welcomed by liberal groups (such as the Quakers and progressive Jewish synagogues), while it is being cautiously viewed by mainstream bodies such as the Anglican church. I have little doubt that more traditionalist and conservative religious groups will be mortified.
Even though I didn't recognise it I was immediately taken back to Sunday evenings about twenty years ago. It was an awful feeling - Sunday evenings were (and still are) my least favourite time of the week. I sensed the very familiar dread of having to go to school the next morning. I was, in fact, 12 years old again, it was late autumn, and I had homework to do.
Tolpuddle’s crack team of experts have spent the last few days grilling DCC’s highways technical officer Dawn Atkin who, to be fair, has been answering fulsomely. First fact to emerge: our little Spaghetti Junction was not Dawn’s idea. It was her predecesor’s, who’s now retired. Secondly, the creation of the new junction involves two quite separate issues – the bulldozing away of the road-side bank by Mr Wood’s team, for which WDDC now requires retrospective planning consent; secondly the surfacing and flood-drainage work for which DCC Highways holds up its hand.
My cell is an android phone so I'm not all too familiar with apple apps, although a lot are similar. So help me out, what are some must have apps out there? I'm going to be honest, I'm not one to typically pay for them, I'm cheap like that, so I'm mostly interested in the freebies.

In brief, the movie is about a perpetually unemployed young man who, through serendipity, meets the runaway son of the Easter Bunny, EB, who has come to Hollywood to become a drummer. However, while the Easter Bunny frets over the disappearance of his son, Carlos, the chief chick in the Easter Bunny’s workshop, stages a coup to overthrow the Easter Bunny, only to be thwarted by EB and the young man, who has now realized his lifelong dream is to actually be the Easter Bunny. In the end, both EB and Fred (the guy) become co-Easter Bunnies and Fred finally earns the respect of his overbearing father (which is, perhaps, the weirdest scene in a movie I’ve seen in a long time).
The flavor of the Madagascar chocolate is unique and fine. You can choose a milk chocolate bar with 44% cocoa or get a strong bold bar with 80% cocoa in it.

Back at April and Andy’s, everyone seems to be raising money and April is still determined to beat Chris, while he seems to be counseling people while racking up huge donations. He’s in such a good mood that he announces that he’s going to ask Millie, Jerry’s daughter, to move in with him and asks Jerry’s permission. He agrees but as soon as Chris leaves the room, Jerry spills that Millie is planning to break up with Chris. Millie soon arrives and goes for a walk with Chris, who has no idea he’s about to be dumped.

"Yes... I know... but with this I can shoot two squads, and be twice as embarrassed in the same match!"
Yes, yes. But I do have some of the gear, supplies, and such, for some of my doings. And, yeah, I know, I'm not the fastest kid on the block. But... look at how long it took me to move in the first place. Hmm, was it four or five years before I finally made it out here. Heck, when I finally decided it was time to leave my last fiancee, it took... a year, no... two. Somehow, even with me gearing up for it and talking about, it still startled her. *grins* She, "You can actually... you know... do things, walk, pack"! Yep. Later. I don't know if I will get to all of it, or any of it, frankly. Though I suspect I will. Having a few things done leads to more. And as I become... more sure... things will take less time to deliberate. Most of my work will probably need to be summer projects, which will cut down on what I do. But summer(ness) can be up to four, five, even six months around these parts. Oh, hush. I'll do what I do, when I can, as I may. I might even surprise you. Well, given my penchant, how can I NOT surprise you? Heh. I love me some womenz flak. Heh.

At first my messages consisted of a scripture or perhaps an inspired entry from one of my journals. Sometimes it was part of an old letter that I had received from a grandparent, or my parents, or even an old romantic letter I had written to their Mother. On occasion it was a quote from one of the General Authorities. As time when on I began to recount stories of my youth, tying them into gospel principles. My children are avid sports fan so I started to tie in sports themes or personal experiences of my own with athletics. Since I have spent most of my life in church leadership I began to intermix inspiring stories of a personal nature that were uplifting and testimony building. There are so many stories of inspiration in the lives of our members. I once recall one of my siblings complaining to my Mother that she saw the gospel in everything. She didn’t deny it. What I have found out is that my mother was right. The influence of the gospel of Jesus Christ is found in all aspects of our lives. The Savior was a great teacher because he taught parables that resonated with the common man. He could relate simple stories that could be understood by all. I have found the more simple the story, the more profound the message.
About 3 years ago I cut my hair into a kind of bob, it was awful, and I've been growing it out ever since, but I've reached a point now where I'm kind of bored with my hair and it's in a bad state right now. I really really really want Alexa Chung style hair, but I'm a bit scared to cut it off in case it looks awful. I know it grows back and stuff but I'm not sure yet, I think I'm going to leave it long until prom and then chop the lot off? Or not? Ahh decisions!

… Players at other schools get suspended, yes, but they have the leadership from the top, for Alabama for example, that a slap on the wrist probably won’t come the second time. When the coach is known as no nonsense, like Nick Saban is, there is little room for misdeeds off the field.

My history with Music is a bit odd. I have been singing since I could talk. I always wanted to learn an instrument, but never found the right one, until recently. My husband is a guitar player, so Music is important to him, as well. Both kids tried guitar, but it wasn't right for either of them. This year, Jay is getting a drum set (we've always known he'd eventually play drums), and Dea is getting a flute (this one is a bit surprising, I admit). Jay is continuing with Native American flute, too. The kids both enjoy singing, but Dea is more likely to continue with it. We try to support them in their instrumental choices, because we know how important it is to have the right instrument, if you're going to play. Music theory is covered by my hubby & curriculum, because my eyes glaze right over when it comes to Music Theory & reading music.
As I write this I'm listening to Sandy Denny singing Who Knows Where The Time Goes. If an old man, and yes, an old woman too, doesn't turn up for a few games in a row, we start to worry about them. But then we'll see him, listing to one side as he makes his way to the stand, the smart old gent with his cap firmly in place, about to suck his burger to death. But we no longer see The Twins. For years they came together each week, identical dirty blonde grey hair, smartly combed, the same dark rimmed glasses and the same achy hipped walk. One season, there was suddenly only one of them. He looked so lost it was unbearable to look at him. He still comes occasionally, but I sense that it is not the same any more. One particularly old couple have looked frail for the whole of the last decade. Their visits gradually got fewer, now he comes alone and looks tired and lonely. And so it rolls on. There's new kids on the front row this week. They look about ten. They can't keep still. They have their arms round each other, swaying and singing. Politely throwing the ball back to the opposition keeper. They'll hopefully grow with us. They'll discover girls, and beer. They'll be less polite to opposition players, and much ruder to the referee. In time they'll be married and have children of their own. One day perhaps they'll remark to each other that they haven't seen Old Northern Bloke for a while.

Finally, she ran out to the garden where her sister sat serenely under the cherry blossom tree, praying softly. Her whispers were the rustle of leaves against the floor, the trickle of the fountain’s stream against moist rock. The princess moved towards her until she could no longer bear the pain, and yet her sister did not look up.
One fact I learned was that many formal dress stores only carry a limited selection of a brand's dresses, so finding a design online does not mean the store will have it available to try on. If you really like many of the dresses of one designer it pays to look for one of their "trunk shows" events, held at different shops at different times of the year, as that is the only way to have an opportunity to try on all the current seasons dresses of that designer.
For now, I do not have a home that looks perfect. But my kids are happy. We have a lot of fun. And those are the most important things.
Using a computer, I pulled the product names, item numbers and images for each Spellbinders die and printed labels and pictures for each. I printed the pictures on photo paper, distressed them using Quick Quotes Mocha Mama Chalking Ink and cut them out using the Spellbinders Labels One Small Die. I affixed the labels to the bottom of the envelopes and then affixed the product image just above the label (for super-small envelopes, I set the product images aside and glued them directly to my pages in a later step).

My friend’s brother-in-law, whom was in his early 30′s, passed away last night in the ICU at a local hospital. He had two children, a wife, and a loving family. He was so young and full of so much hope of what was yet to come.
Nine years ago we moved our family south. The day we moved in, another family was moving in just across the street from us. ”She” was a mom with two little girls with bows in their hair that matched their dresses and their dresses had monogrammed little initials on the front. The family went to church every week, never yelled and they attended “play dates.” ”She” drove a white Volvo station wagon, (uh-huh, one of those.)
Contemporary policy does not ensure peace in Europe; it endangers it. The salvation of the euro has long since achieved a mass effect similar to that of the Treaty of Versailles at the time of the Weimar Republic. Enormous fortunes are being destroyed and re-distributed. The ordinary person’s buying power is sinking. The policies of today are laying the groundwork for the poverty of tomorrow and thus creating the prerequisites for the wars and conflicts of the day after tomorrow. That is the reality.

I do own some bike lights and a bike helmet for the record, though I don’t always use them. When the weather is nice, I do bike to the park, wearing my helmet, to go for runs. Biking to the park reveals some major issues with the ciclorutas, as about half of the ride can be taken over a gorgeous excellently paved cicloruta on the median between east and westbound traffic. In order to get to the cicloruta however, there’s a lot of buseta/speeding cars right-turning/pedestrian dodging to be done. On the way back the path courteously spits you out onto a really busy two lane road that randomly forks and most cars really don’t seem to give a shit that just because you’re in the right lane doesn’t mean you’re turning right and nearly take out your bici-riding ass in the process of going right an inch away from you.
I am seeing this as a wake up call, not a bad thing. I mean, a relationship can only grow stronger from open pathways of communication, honest conversation and I think sometimes we all get a wee bit too comfortable, a wee bit too blase about the relationships we are in. Comfort and familiarity can sometimes lead us to a place we don't want to be.

I found out some of these re-enactors travel all over the state and beyond participating in Civil War events with their "authentic" replica uniforms, equipment and rifles. I don't think there's a union, but there probably is some sort of organization you can contact if you're interested in participating. They did mention they are always looking for Union soldiers since no one wants to be one. Funny thing...no matter how many times they re-enact the war, the outcome is still the same.

The second consequence is a kind of reverse of the first one. We will pursue our surfaces in a compulsive and manic way as if mania and excess were the revenge of Aphrodite herself upon us for taking too seriously all of this talk about our invisible interiors. We will become absorbed in plastic surgery and modes of existence in which the surface or our lives is an obsessive and above all CONFORMIST project. (In, for example, some narrow and Platonic ideal of thinness).

Both Mirza and Gilderdale suffered – and perhaps died – because of the unforgivable actions, and also the unforgivable inaction, of members of the medical profession. Mirza was committed to a mental institution to treat an illness that was purely physical and never recovered from the damage that did. Gilderdale, too, was referred to a psychiatrist when she needed physicians working from the results of cutting-edge studies. The question we must ask is obvious: how many young people like them, and like Collingridge, have to die before their illness is taken seriously and huge, well-focused efforts are made to cure it through properly funded biomedical research?

For a long time … my father continued to pay absolutely no attention to his own death. After his funeral, he just kept coming home. He had a place set for him at the table, he received his mail at the old address. He had parked the car (as the only one in the family who could drive) in its regular place. His raincoat hung on the hook by the door, his hat lay on the rack. His footsteps were heard regularly on the stairs, he shut doors – upstairs, outside – behind him all the time. And when you got up to see what was taking him so long, you could still smell his tobacco in the hall: as if he’d just gone out the door and would come back in a bit. Sometimes I had to pull out the obituary just to convince myself that he was dead.

Perhaps it’s just me. Perhaps I’m overly sensitive. I’ve worked in restaurant kitchens. It’s hard work. And so to say, hey, ladies, don’t worry about getting greasy and sweaty and working so hard: as long as you’ve got a hot body, you can be a Food Network star is already insulting enough. But then, Maxim, to take one of the chefs who doesn’t prance around half-naked and try to sell us semi-homemade crap in 30 minutes or less, and reduce her life’s work to slippery hot butter sex? And in fact, to suggest she’s just a stick of melty animal by-product for your consumption? Too much.
I love being a dad. Saying that is an expression of love and I, too, say that sometimes. I know he loves his kids; but his weltanschauung or Platonic Ideal of “love” is perhaps not congruent with mine. And that’s part of what makes talking about love difficult. It’s awfully subjective and our intellectual concept of ourselves and how we assume we might behave in a certain circumstance, spoken blithely to a receptive audience at cocktail hour, is not necessarily the same as our actual expressions or actions when the metal meets the meat.
All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn’t deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job – the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other – because you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there’s someone behind you, watching your back.
The gallery space soon began to draw crowds and groups of people queued up for hours to get inside to look at the photos. It was almost as though it became a necessary pilgrimage; to see what others had seen, to be able to compare the experiences of these strangers with the events that had shaken your own world, to compare, to confirm that yes - this thing really had happened.
It's a sharper, crisper experience, it's somehow more alert in the glass, but these are small degrees of difference and they lead the drink experience in a deliciously new direction - one that I wanted to continue travelling along far beyond the single bottle I had with me.

I don't know how to help my child build sense of curiosity when so much of the world is put off limits with "no." Be it the end result of smearing peanut butter in your hair or the desire to listen to every single CD at the play station in the book store, saying "yes" helps your child open their eyes to more and more possibilities. "No" is viewing the world through a paper towel tube, perhaps a straw. "Yes" is viewing it through a wide-angle lens - or from a hot air balloon, a thousand feet off the ground.

This is one of those flicks that show the Coens basically giving a little tribute out to the good old days of black and white cinema noir, and it actually feels like one that would have been made back in those days too. The cinematography is beautiful and I think it was used for a great mood because I couldn’t have expected this being filmed in anything else other than black and white. The score is also great not because it sounds cool but because it’s actually made up of a bunch of actual pieces of orchestra music that adds a lot to the dark mood as well. Technically, the Coens do a fine job here and made me feel like I needed to blow some smoke while watching it just to get in the mood.

But it is a mistake to confuse what goes into a database with what comes out of it. Routinely, those who create databases enter fragments of information that do not have autonomous value in a piecemeal manner while users take out something else, coherent chunks, often tailor-made according to what variables they have entered.

I’ve never really met anyone famous. But, thanks to someone I briefly dated decades ago, my aunt and a neighbor, I am actually remarkably well-connected.

The first half was a high scoring fast pace game. The score going into half was 47 to 55 with the bulls in the lead. Even without Rose the bulls were putting up a fight and would play well without him. The bulls were out rebounding and putting more hustle into the game. Even with the sixers shooting over 50% there defense could not stop the bulls. Another reason why the bulls were doing so good; the sixers were doing something they never do and turning the ball over. That was hurting them a lot. Going into half time coach Doug Collins must have said something to get the team going, because the sixers were a new team out there.
Some of us have choice and some of us like to think we have choice. When interacting with the mental health system we need to tread carefully and sometimes look out for ourselves because our doctors may not do that for us.
Our culture teaches us that we are each autonomous individuals who are only responsible for our own well-being. We end up believing that we are independent creatures who should make our own way in life without depending on others. In reality, we all rely on each other for our daily existence. We eat food that grows in soil nurtured by microscopic organisms. We drink water that has vaporized from the oceans. we breathe oxygen respired by the trees and wear clothing made by people across the planet whom we will never meet. We rely on our friends and family for support and create a sense of belonging and meaning within our communities. Our personal well-being is inextricably linked to the well-being of our families, our friends, our communities, and our planet. And the well-being of others, in turn, is shaped by our own well-being.

McKeeva Bush said, Wednesday, that the Canadian Commercial Corporation, which is Canada’s official international contracting agency, will find Canadian companies with the capabilities to take on the project but that Caymanian companies and labour would still be used. Asked by the opposition when the MOU would be a public document, the premier said he didn’t know as he hadn’t signed it.

"The problem," as he explains it, "was to make all that architecture work together and make sense visually. I was able to do that by having windows on the sides of the piece to accommodate the cross views. I gave the subway platform a sense of depth by using a carefully placed mirror at the far end. As with almost all of my projects, the sight lines were critical." The piece, we might say, required a kind of Piranesian optical correction so that all its cross-angles and counterviews could be spatially comprehensible.
Our family was now living apart because my husband had to return to work. I was a single mother Monday to Friday and suddenly our family who did everything together did most things apart. My career was finished, our savings were disappearing fast, we had to sell a car to make ends meet and put our investment house up for sale to clear the debt. We were one income down and eventually when my husband found a job, so our family could be reunited, he took a huge pay cut to do so.

The future patents, when offered to and accepted by the licensee, become part of the licensed patents and are subject to royalty payments. Therefore, future patents can add to the term of agreements written for the life of the patents. The licensee should understand this consequence before requesting or accepting such responsibility. On the other hand, often the licensee is not given the right to apply for any patent, anywhere in the world, covering any invention disclosed to it under the agreement, without the licensor`s permission.

DORNING: “History expert on the secrets of the SA 'bush war" murdered: Dr Warwick Antony Dorning, was shot dead execution-style at his Adamshurst Howick, Mpophomeni farm 2009-11-07 – an SAPS inspector, was arrested... Journalist Julia Denny-Dimitriou reported that the former senior government official and farmer was shot dead execution-style on his farm Adamshurst near Howick’s Mpophomeni area. He used to work as the chief-of-staff in the Premier’s office.Peter Miller, former Finance MEC - a long-time associate and family friend, said two armed men entered and shot him “stone dead, in cold blood, without warning,” The police were called and they found a 9 mm cartridge and a spent bullet on the scene.Miller said Dorning’s death was “a totally unnecessary killing. He worked for me for most of his career. He served the new South Africa in a very high capacity with distinction for about 15 years.He was a really generous and warm-hearted person.He was a highly educated man and an accomplished historian. Much of his PhD thesis, which covered recent South African history, including the bush war, is still classified. A kind and good man has been wantonly killed when he still had so much to offer.” It was reported later in The Witness that among the three arrested men had been a Howick falls SAPS-inspector Michael Sokhela. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Farmer-shot-without-warning-20091108
8. Ask discussion-oriented questions when things go wrong and be sure to have kids identify several things. Ask 1) what went wrong, 2) what made it go wrong, and 3) what are the possible solutions. Be sure to have them identify many possible solutions before choosing one. For example, when our broomstick fell too quickly on our falling pendulum, the kids identified all the things that could slow it down. They could increase friction, decrease the broomstick’s weight, or decrease the incline of the pendulum track. We discussed the pros and cons of each avenue before the kids made their choice.

In January a nurse in Aberdeen was exposed as she “repeatedly slapped elderly patients at a care home“.

Nietzsche attributes this as a method by which women maintain their womanliness, and “charm” society into not taking their persons seriously enough to analyze their deceptive nature (for which their assumed secondary role serves as a perfect clout) and the full extent of their cunning influence. Despite his chauvinism, Nietzsche staunchly believes that woman is the cleverer sex, and thereby also the more evil one.[14] This belief in the diabolical cleverness of women leads the philosopher to conclude that the overconfidence men have in their so-called domestication of the female sex, is nothing more than a façade, promoted by women themselves:
We have chosen a different imaging place this time because we feel that the one we went to for Avery's ultrasounds was lacking in knowledge. I feel like they should have noticed that something wasn't right with her. Between her lack of proper growth and the way her umbilical cord looked, they should have noticed something. Anything.
Anyway Filmgoer and I decided that we would just combine our funds and get them a bunch of stuff rather than one big gift. My only rule was that if there was a "Monkey" version of said item, then we get it. That has been drilled into my head for years by my mother, "Baby shower + our family= monkeys". I'm guessing it's a good luck thing for us but I wasn't planning on going against it. So together we bought a potable bouncy chair, some shampoo, toys, pacifiers, teething rings, towels and receiving blankets. We were going to buy more, but we then realized that when the kid was born we would still be spoiling him not matter what so it would be better to just wait and get him more stuff later. Dreamer got some stuff on his own, specifically the highlight he gave them was his own teddy bear which he named "Tibbers", which I think is from League of Legends. I'm not sure since I don't play.

History: Considering the recent innovations of American craft brewers pushing the envelope to satisfy the need for increasingly intense products, Triple B may be stretched to cover historical and modern American/English ales that are stronger and hoppier, yet lack the malt intensity of classic barleywines (although, this comes close!). The adjective "triple" is arbitrary and simply implies a stronger version of an ESB - "imperial", "extra", "extreme" or any other variety of adjective would be equally valid.

Our attitude seems to be one of “if I don’t see it, it goes away.” This is fiction! This is a wrong thought! Where else do we do this throughout our day? We definitely do this with our philosophy on healing and health. We treat symptoms today, medicines often only ‘hide” symptoms but don’t cure. Yikes! We have a headache and grab for aspirin, the headache goes away, many times only to return a few hours later. So did we help ourselves or did we just temporarily hide something out of view? Did we help ourselves or just suppress symptoms? To help ourselves we need to shine a bright light on our actions. Why can’t we ask ourselves first, “why do I have a headache?” before reaching for an aspirin. This quick contemplation can reveal the path to healing but we are not in the habit of questioning our symptoms. A headache may be coming for a variety of reasons, from too much stress, not enough water, lack of sleep, to hormone imbalance, or any other number of causes, but the goal is getting to the root cause so that you can change the life style habit that is causing the symptom.

Clearly, not all immigrants are Muslims, but they make up a sizeable proportion, and their high birth rate, which averages 4 children per mother — you will note I did not say per couple, because Muslim males can claim welfare payments and housing costs for up to 4 wives and unlimited children, even though polygamy is illegal in Britain — so this, coupled with uncontrolled immigration, has essentially doubled their population every decade since 1960, when there were only some 80,000 Muslims in Britain. By 1990 this figure had grown to 1 million and by 2000 to just under 2 million. A recent study estimated there are now around 3-4 million Muslims in Britain, although this figure is very much open to debate and is quite likely far, far higher.

We have had some mockingbird activity in the bush beside our front door/stoop for a few weeks now. Over the weekend, my fiance and his son discovered a nest in the bush, and within the nest were three baby mockingbirds. This absolutely thrilled me! I viewed it as a good omen, partly because I think it is an honor when a member of the animal kingdom chooses to make its home and raise its young in such close proximity to one's own abode, and partly because it provided a linkage between my life and one of my favorite Bob Marley songs, "Three Little Birds." The chorus of that song -- "don't worry about a thing, because every little thing is gonna be alright" -- contains words that I really should take to heart a lot more often than I do.

For me, it’s important to decide when to use a commercial item in my work and not hand fabricate every single element, as I was trained to do. For example, I know how to make a box clasp but does it make sense for me when I can purchase one for a few dollars and solder it into the piece I’m making? I have to decide when I can make money on that extra labor and when I can’t.

Karl Marx’s ideas are a common touchstone for many people working for change. His historical materialism, his many contributions to political economy and class analysis, all continue to serve his core values–the self-emancipation of the working class and a vision of a classless society. There are naturally many trends in Marxism that have developed over the years, and new ones are on the rise today. All of them and others who want to see this project succeed are welcome here.

I began to search for my birthmother when I was 18 years old, just shortly after having my second child, my son Jaimy. I was totally a computer illiterate at that time and so I self-educated myself. I created my first e-mail address; I joined support groups, forums and wrote letters to try to obtain information that would help me locate her. I even created groups in Facebook. There were a lot of dead ends and a recurring voice in my head that said I shouldn’t be trying to find her. I would be intruding on her life if I showed up now. It wasn’t fair to her and in the end; I had to admit that she might just not want to be found.
I also love the voices that tell this story. The story is told by several of the children and parents, each one adding a piece to the portrait of this loving, if somewhat misunderstood country matriarch.

Enough about them, Magic Ship were the star turn. Thanks to all who came to see us and there were a lot of you. The room was packed and (I will say so myself) we delivered big time.

What sets us apart from other acts is our come what may attitude and the feeling that anything we do together - be it a new song, our CD or a live show - is a real band and personal accomplishment. I think we really care that people come to see us. We really care that people like our songs. We really care about putting on a good show.

Last weekend friends visited from Williams, Oregon, a very small town in the Rogue Valley (a most romantic name for a locale). Living in the country they see little of civilization, thus the opportunity to shop at the garage sale going on across the street was of immense excitement. Filling two cars full with garage sale wares, they made their way home. I picked up a stash of 1980s movies and spent the day painting Moleskines whilst conducting my own personal Christian Slater marathon.
The two unsavory protagonists are complete binary opposites and have been described by MacDonagh as a father and son figure on ‘holiday.’ Ray wants nothing to do with the “Fairy Tale” city – repeating a phrase that will surely be remembered as the most iconic line in the film: “Bruges is a shit-hole.” Although as the older and wiser of the two, Ken (Gleeson) greets Burges with his tourist handbook in hand: “We shall strike a balance between culture and fun” while Ray jests: “Somehow I believe, Ken, that the balance shall tip in the favor of culture, like a big fat fucking retarded fucking black girl on a see-saw opposite…a dwarf. “
Is it a system seller? No, not even for those of us who have played every one since Metal Gear Solid and for those who know nothing about nothing, they’re just going to turn off the console because they didn’t expect cutscenes that last for half-an-hour. Speaking as a fan, the problem with Metal Gear Solid 4 is how un-metal gear solid it is. You go around the world, visiting multiple locations, while in previous installments you were more or less wandering around one, like Shadow Moses or Tselinoyarsk and their environs. There are only two people you can call on the codec and saving is done in a menu. The missions, and I can’t believe an MGS has missions plural instead of a mission like Operation Snake Eater, are all linear. There is no backtracking. It’s like the second these old series jumped on to the new generation they dropped most of their established conventions, the conventions that made them, to make the jump. Resident Evil suffered from this exact same thing. This linearity hurts all the new features they put in. There is a ton of guns with customizable parts, you can roll onto your back while crawling and your camo, to my disappointment, is automatic. The worst travesty however is the utter removal of an MGS staple: procure on site. There’s a damn store in your pause menu to buy any and all guns and the necessary ammo. And you can take the weapons of dead enemies and use them, after unlocking them of course. But in truth, you don’t need all these new features to beat the game. They’re superfluous. Very, very superfluous. Once I got the M14 I got through the entire game with just it, I didn’t need any other gun nor did I need all those cool attachments. For the boss fights I used the Saiga 12 loaded with the rubber ring ammo to get the facemasks and that gun doesn’t even have customization. I only once rolled onto my back on the last mission and that was by pure accident. The only time I used the oil drum was when I got it and that only amounted in rolling around in a circle before I got bored and shot someone. Unlike in Metal Gear Solid 3, where you needed to keep your stamina up, you needed to dig out the bullets and sew those cuts close; you don’t need all this new shit.

Transformation is slow, mindful change. It is patient moment-to-moment and incremental change. It is humbling and requires compassion as I tend and nourish an internal garden and attempt to bring the quiet of those moments into the busyness of my life. Each time I sit, I need a quiet mind to reveal the hidden wisdom. Until this morning, I considered stewardship as caring for something external, but it begins from within.

Scholes says that’s not what happened at all. “It had nothing to do with equations and nothing to do with models,” he says. “I was not running the firm, let me be very clear about that. There was not an ability to withstand the shock that occurred in the market in the summer and fall of late 1998. So it was just a matter of risk-taking. It wasn’t a matter of modelling.”

Finally, I hope this blog may become a source of advice for potential fashion students, looking to choose a place to study. I found, when researching universities and courses (and, I did a lot of research!) that there is a massive lack of information and advice in this area.

So if you are reading this as a potential fashion degree student and you need some advice from someone who’s been through it all, please get in touch!

Spent another hour there, hubby went off to another floor to get a couple of new cases and said he would meet me at the checkout. Silly idea, there are five checkouts on the two floors and despite trawling the whole store he was nowhere to be found, at which point the low batter signal came on, so I hastily paid for my goodies and went downstairs to see if he was waiting by the main doors..............sorry it's a long story, hope you are still with me.
I can’t even pray. I just can’t. I am grateful for all of the prayers offered on our behalf, but I just can’t pray right now. All of the “what ifs” are running through my mind and I can’t fathom something being wrong with her. What would I do? I know that God loves her and loves me, but come on…I just want to get a break. I just want things to be normal…I mean really “normal” for once. So for now, I’ll just ride along on the prayers of others. I believe that God understands where I am right now. I believe that regardless of my inability to put together any semblance of a prayer, He is still carrying me through this difficult time. At least, that’s what I hope. I do pray/hope that your little sister will be fine. But what if she’s not?

We knew that Mom was slipping many years ago when my cousin finally had to tear down the old barn that her father had built by himself. It was a safety hazard and beyond repair. Every time my parents would go visit my father's mother in her assisted living facility, they would meander over the state line to drive past the old farms. It was a shock when the barn was gone, but Mom relived its demise time and time again, every time they drove past.

I remember in the Bible book of Exodus, when the Israelites were leaving Egyptian bondage they looted the Egyptians and took away a great deal of gold and jewelry. Was that stealing? No, the Egyptians had no right to enslave them so they owed the Israelites back pay.

The statistics include only those who die of sudden heart attack in the hospital. Abrupt cardiac failure also happens to men and women who die outside of the hospital and to unknown numbers who look sudden death in the face but survive. It occurs to those with heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes, and the elderly, and those ’contributing factors’ are blamed for the death even when they are not responsible. According to NCHS, death certificates listing Acute Myocardial Infarction as the primary cause actually occur almost 30% more often than officially tabulated.

Carbs: For Goodness sake, don’t cut out your carbs. Haven’t you ever heard: fat burns in a carbohydrate fire? I am feeling ill listening to the ladies talk about carb-cutting. Your BIG goal for carbohydrates is going to be to consume low-glycemic carbohydrates versus starchy carbohydrates. The difference is that low-glycemic sources of carbohydrates (yams, brown rice, long grain wild rice, lentils, quinoa, whole beans etc…) go into your system slowly and prevent a spike in your blood sugar. Starchy carbohydrates (white bread, pasta, potatoes and junk food) should be avoided as much as possible because our bodies convert those foods into sugar, and subsequently…FAT. If you are going to be indulging in bread or toast, stick to whole wheat ( like Dave’s Killer Bread) or sourdough, but only if you must. You must completely avoid white bread, potato bread, country-style buttermilk and all types of biscuits (unless you are having a treat meal). If you choose pasta it is best to go with high-protein wheat or brown rice pasta as opposed to flour.

It is one thing to trust in the Lord at the beginning of a journey… it’s another to see Him when you arrive at your destination. Think about Job.

No…the fact is God had sent us packing. And Yes, for the record…He had kept part of HIS DEAL.
I love Elizabeth Bennett from Pride and Prejudice. She is one of my favorite characters of all-time, so part of me was a little apprehensive about reading this book. J got it for me for my birthday and in March, when I wanted to take a break before reading the final Percy Jackson novel, I decided to dive in.

In early March, Cheri had purchased her first home. Home ownership was of many achievements she had on her bucket list. Enthusiastic about her long await dream come true, she couldn’t wait to get started making the place her own. A one bedroom bungalow located in the middle of town was perfect for Cheri and her adventurous lifestyle. Decorating the space was her plan for the summer. Her desires to embellish the space took over her erect appetite to tease young men. Although it never complete left her train of thought.
We know that's not possible but it's the reason so many Canadians are buying houses they cannot afford. Thanks to cheap money they intend to buy houses they assume will increase in value at a rate greater than inflation. It's a better long-term investment than a savings account as well as an attractive short term investment if they intend to flip the property. However, we know that many young Canadians are postponing home ownership because of sky-rocketing house prices. So where exactly is the demand coming from that not only keeps house prices in key Canadian markets from falling but continuously rising? What's driving the market? Perhaps looking south can help us answer that.
They served their wine in nice crystal glasses. Even the water was served in crystal. The beer? It came in the bottle with a napkin wrapped around it.

Mars Hill Bible Church in Grand Rapids (senior pastor Rob Bell) has the following statement of purpose: “We take great joy in partnering with God to change the world, embracing the truth that all of life is sacred.”
There is much we could conclude from this situation, but I’ll highlight just two observations.
I don't really quilt. I have made a quilt top before, but it's just a quilt top... it's never been put through the whole sandwiching, quilting, binding rigamarole. I keep thinking I'll do it one day, but I always find something else to do. I do like the concept of quilting... making the top anyway.

A few cars and a moving van were stopped...then I saw it with my eyes, a motorcycle sort of crumpled up. All by itself, the bent front wheel still circling itself. Maybe caused by the breeze out here on the Interstate. It is Tuesday. I've been out a week from Naples. Nearby the bike is a body, . Apparently a young man lost control of his two wheeler machine, got into sand on the side of the road, and wound up--as it turned out--quite dead.

"I'm counting on it." He frowned, his face going from rat-like and a little sad to a ferocious intensity that made Pevan's guts quiver. "I mean you to know where my Witnessing came from, why it's important. There isn't time now." Behind Pevan, shouts drifted through the Gateway, Dagdan's voice among them. Van Raighan glanced down, then met her eyes again. "Your town won't be harmed, I swear it. All I ask is a chance to explain myself to you."

"Usually when adults say teens need to be responsible or complain that they’re not responsible enough, what they’re actually talking about is being submissive. A teen is called ‘responsible’ when they shut up and do as they’re told without complaining or questioning what the point of what they’re being asked to do is.” -Elisha
Lilith knows that were she to feed him the fruit from the Tree of Life that once grew in Eden, he might live, but it is still forbidden to her.

“No, only with dinner,” replies the hostess apologetically. K and I exchange a look. This is not going well. We were specifically told we could purchase wine, and only wine, if we chose. Short of singing to a crack in the sidewalk and waiting for a grapevine to magically spring up, there seems little hope of accomplishing our mission.

Hi Folks! Here’s a note from KaBOOM!, the non-profit dedicated to making sure there are playgrounds everywhere, and that kids actually get out and enjoy them. Like “Take Our Children to the Park…And Leave Them There Day,” KaBOOM! has a week in September when it encourages communities to get all the kids outside, playing together. And now the community with the best plans for revamping a playground, or getting kids active, or creating community connectedness seems to be eligible for a grant, too. A biggie!
I recently read Clarity by Kim Harrington. It was enjoyable — teen girl with psychic powers (actually, the same kind of power as Erica Reed!) tries to put her abilities to the task to help solve a murder in which her brother has become a suspect. Clare is an interesting character with potential for good storylines and growth. I particularly enjoyed that it was set on Cape Cod, where my family has owned a summer cottage my whole life, and I recognized a number of references to the kind of town, the kind of locations, and the kind of people that showed up in the story. The restaurant that everyone goes to almost constantly, for example. Called Yummy’s in the story, I immediately pictured Kream ‘n’ Kone, a popular place to go for food near our cottage, that serves seafood and other tasty fried dishes, and is a hotspot for local teen activity. As the main character, Clare, goes about the story and investigation, I pictured the houses I’m familiar with, the trees that grow on the Cape, the beaches I’ve been to hundreds of times. Perhaps because of this setting, I’d call it a good summer beach read.
vs 4-5: And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built, and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.

Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was the modern day great of Qawwali, a style of devotional music with its roots in the Sufi branch of Islam. I’ve always been partial to the music of Pakistan & India, so when I first heard Nusrat sing, I was hooked. He was one of the first stars of the 1980s boom in “world” music, but there’s much more to the great Nusrat than his international releases. This is the first Nusrat piece I heard – Shams-ud-Doha, Badr-ud-Doja, from the Shahen Shah album. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVO2PY6PWI0

Most Artists, including writers, but mainly musicians and writers, can be some of the most arrogant and self-absorbed people on the planet. In my bar, I see it all the time. Small town, tiny, tiny, bar and the lead singer is acting like Lady Gaga about to perform at the dropping of the Big Apple. It would be amusing if it wasn’t so sad. I feel as artists/writers we must humble ourselves. Even though most of you will screech in terror at this observation I must tell you, “If you are an artist or writer or whatever you wish to call yourself you are not ‘gifted’ or ‘special’ or even ‘talented’.” But what if you are published?
With these preliminary warnings, then, I would direct you to the National Gallery’s website, where you can see Joachim Beukelear’s “The Four Elements”. Look at them; scrutinise them; but then look back and see what Janet Kofi-Tsekpo makes of them.

By denying the realities of the war they deny the existence, the humanity of those victims whose lives will forever be shaken in ways they cannot ever comprehend. They forget or ignore the uphill battle left in revising policy and discriminatory practices so deeply engrained in Sri Lanka’s social fabric. They deny thousands of fellow Sri Lankans equality of citizenship by decrying their tenuous present and horrific experiences are fictions concocted by the international humanitarian apparatus.

In the days following my discovery, it was hard to think of anything else. When I lay down at night, the images of those stacked bodies and the slack-jawed living skeletons would not permit me a luxury like sleep. If I slept, then I would be equally complicit with those who had permitted these atrocities.
One Direction is a band formed by members Harry, Niall, Zayn, Liam and Louis ( of course, everyone knows that). They were discovered on the British show “X Factor” but unfortunately, they didn’t win the competition. After their experience however, they were given a contract by none other than the famous judge, Simon Cowell, and we all know what happened after that.

All self-respecting towns have a shopping arcade. The best examples are those that were built during the Victorian era, some of these being truly beautiful. Littlehampton’s Arcade dates, by its own admission, from 1922, and lacks the pizzazz of its Victorian counterparts. Nonetheless, I like a nice arcade and was glad to see this one. Content is as important as the wrapping, of course, and arcades survive or fail on the quality of the businesses within them.
We need to shift our thought process to one of offering multiple product options — even if the products considered may include higher initial costs. Clients today may appreciate a solution offering a cash value fund in addition to the protection guarantee. By offering options that include both cash accumulation and protection, a client can have an insurance plan with flexibility for unanticipated changes that may occur down the road. So how is this shift in thinking accomplished? An answer may be to start offering multiple product options, rather than the single solution of no-lapse UL.

I still think it was a mistake to post us. What’s wrong with a nice personal hand delivery? Ribbon round the trunk, lovely. I could’ve held the gift tag in my beak. I wouldn’t have minded. Anything’s better than a week in a box with branches digging in every which way. We spent two days horizontal in a draughty depot, no lie. Then – ta da! – she tears off the sparkly wrapping and half the tree’s bent the wrong way and all the pears are squashed. What’s she supposed to do with that? Poor thing, I don’t blame her for crying.
So by now it was time to call the Telecommunications Ombudsman and register a complaint. The lady I spoke to there did assure me that there would have to some evidence of a debt existing if it had to be paid. At last, a voice of reason! And of action, apparently - only a few moments later Ms DC from the collection agency called me and told me that Optus had recalled the debt, and that I wouldn't be hearing any more from them, the matter was resolved from their point.

All I can say in conclusion Flo is that all of this is the absolute truth. All of it. Let me add one last bit of info for you. In DNA paternity testing, a child will usually share a marker w/each parent, however, up to 2 exclusions are allowed, for particular markers, as they can mutate. In the 13 marker test between Jes and I? Flo, we share 9 of 13 markers – that is only 2 above the threshold that could have made him my (birth) father. If you were to see the numbers between all of us? You’d know beyond a shadow of a doubt that all of this is true. I also asked Debbie to submit her DNA for testing. Ie: I wanted to see by what ratio she & I matched since she & I are known 1st cousins. We match by the same ratio that Jesse & I match the Presley side & the same ratio that Jesse matches the Smith side.

Luxury isn't frivolous. It should be exceptionally well-made, and I hope in conditions that provide a living wage, health care, and other benefits. I am not a saint or a crusader in the latter regard, but I do my best. Fashion can provide handicrafts/decorative arts workers a venue for their expertise. I saw this in India back in 1997/98, and I believe it can still work like that--you just gotta search.

Lately, I have been thinking about what my life would have been like had I chosen a different path in life. I never thought of being a business major in college. But lately I have wondered if I should have been a business major. Or a doctor? Or anything other than a graphic designer/artist. I should have listened to my father when he told me I wouldn't make as much money as I thought I would. He wasn't discrediting my abilities. He just thought I could make more money doing something else. And unlike me, he knew I wouldn't be happy with less money. Oh dad's they are SO smart.

Maybe it was the women who started to find a voice and yell at the top of their lungs that they wanted men who were more emotionally involved. They wanted men who tried to understand their feelings as well as sharing their own feelings too. How shocking to demand such a thing from the uber masculine males. As exciting as the bad boys are portrayed, women are choosing to settle with the complete opposite of those characteristics. Many women remember those days when ‘real men don’t share their feelings.’ They just avoided it all, turned to alcohol and smoking in order to deal with their problems. Apparently, that did not work too well except to produce alcoholics and absentee husbands and fathers. In recent years, a number of men have caught on to the trend of the dreaded open communication. However, it seems that men are okay with communication until they are hurting very deeply and instead of sharing, they revert back to the strong silent broody type.
One of my college besties, Ash, started a blog, and I loved reading it and kept thinking how special it was going to be for her to get to have all of her memories documented on her blog! I apprehensively started one, got a little slow start, had some commitment issues, and sometime this past summer, things just clicked! I've been going strong ever since! I find so much joy in blogging! It's a great outlet for me, and I've connected with some wonderful blogger friends!

…Condom possession in itself is not illegal in New York, nor in any other state. Rather, the fact that condoms can be used in court as evidence of prostitution means that police will sometimes confiscate condoms, interrogate those carrying several, and use them as part of the basis for arrest. A law like the one in New York would clarify that possession is permitted, quelling fears among those who want to use them. “If there is no way an item will ever be used as evidence, then there’s no excuse to ever take it or put it in an arrest sheet,” said Baskin….

PBDEs are endocrine disrupters that have been shown to have reproductive toxicity, and are also suspected to play a role in cancer formation.

It is these positions that provoke these young men. I denounce this, of course. I denounce any action like the hijacking or bombing of an airplane. More than 20 years ago, I issued a fatwa, categorically prohibiting the hijacking of airplanes. What have the passengers done to deserve having their plane destroyed, or having any of them killed? It is not their fault. You should not punish them for something done by others. However, we must search for the deep-rooted reasons for this indiscriminate, futile, or violent behavior. This behavior has not emerged out of the blue. It has its reasons. If we want to treat something, we must treat its reasons.

I think I had about 15 minutes alone at the site before the others caught up, plenty of time to recoup and connect once again to that subtle contact. All worries and woes seemed to melt away in the dimming sunlight; any lingering turmoil of past upheavals seemed insignificant and evaporated in the breeze. Once the others joined me we placed our stones down around the site to relinquish burdens and of course in fond memorial of friends we had never met but live on through our work.

Nobody is really sure what they were for but over four hundred have been found around Scotland. At one time they were thought to be Saxon since most were not found in situations that could place them historically but, a little more recently, some have been found in Scara Brae, and we now know that they date back to around 3000BC. Much of the decoration matches the style of pottery known to have come from this time.

So it’s hard to sort out. And of course, I have some old and dry philosophies that I have made habit that I really need to get rid of.

Seeking power and election, our politicians and pundits on both sides are capitalizing on the people’s discontent and unscrupulously degrading the honesty of public discourse. The dangerous effect is the erosion of our national solidarity. If left unchecked, this antagonistic version of populism—so anathema to our Constitution’s moderated understanding of a government for the people—is prone to devolving further into the politics of fear mongering, radicalism, extremism, and xenophobic nationalism, which historically descend further into violence and anarchy.

That said, I don’t really want to pay $10 to read the second novel. As other reviewers have pointed out, Ana constantly refers to her “inner goddess,” and it gets to be quite annoying after the fiftieth mention. Also, I find the endearment “baby” to be quite nauseating, so the fact that that was his main term of endearment for her got to me. I realize that I’m probably alone in this opinion, but I thought I’d mention it anyway.

YAY! I am so proud of myself! When I first created this blog I just used the boring layout that Blogger offered for free but I hated it. I wanted something that had some pizazz. I do not have the money to spend for some computer proficient bloggy designer to get my blog all decked out so I had to make the most of what I had. First and foremost, I had recently read a blog that talked about Scrapblog and how awesome it was. It's a virtual scrapbooking site where slackers like me can make scrapbook pages for free. You can opt to spend money on it if you want but I was able to do some cute stuff without spending a dime. It was super easy. Beth at The Stories from A to Z gives us the scoop on Scrapblog ANNND has a full tutorial if any of you are interested. Pretty sweet :) Little ole me is not in the way of giving instructions on anything.. HA! I had to reference Beth's post like eighty times just to figure out how to use Scrapblog and get it onto my computer.

First, there's the matter of the arboreal genocide on my street. The aftermath has been interesting: on the stub (it's not tall enough to call it a stump) where one of the trees was someone has taken a Christmas tree outline, made of stout bronze wire, and screwed it to the former living tree. On the end of each of its "branches," this decoration has a candle-holder, and various residents have stuck candles in there and lit them. There's nothing in them as of a few minutes ago, but this may change. In the meanwhile, it's been festooned with strings of tinsel and ribbon.

The next test was something they called the Volume Challenge. While measuring my blood pressure continuously, they also gave me 500ml of a salt solution through an IV over 15 minutes to examine blood pressure response to this extra volume in the vascular system. After having been to Labor & Delivery 15 times before actually having Julia, I can tell you, 15 minutes for this IV was incredibly fast. They usually did this to me about once a week leading up to my birth and it would take an hour or more! I told this to Dr. Bernstein, who said that its funny there isn't a lot of evidence to suggest that an IV will actually calm a uterus or stop contractions. So funny, all those IVs were for nothing! Well you never know, maybe it helped me stay pregnant longer! I will never know!

Meat glue is made up of the coagulant of the blood of pigs and cows. The scientific name for this compound is “transglutaminase.” Someone figured out that you could use this stuff to stick pieces of meat together, and you can sell that meat as something else. As an example, I saw a video showing a chef using meat glue on stew meat and then serving it up as Filet Mignon. And the usage is prevalent in restaurants.
Remember my borrowed begloved finery? Have you ever tried eating and drinking with Long Kid Gloves on? Take my advice. Don't. They make your fingers thick and clumsy like thumbs. I managed to hold onto the champagne (goblet not flute, of course), taking large swigs to calm my frayed nerves. Then, having been too strung up to eat anything beforehand, I slipped into the Ball Supper room, spread with a sumptuous buffet, for a tiny snack. The rarest of roast beef from the royal herds and pink poached salmon with cucumber scales lay on ornate silver dishes. Fishy eyes stared disapprovingly as I tried to manhandle glass, plate and cutlery with increasing desperation. Cutting beef with a fork? One handed? With gloves on? When you're a klutz? Just before everything tipped off the plate and all over some unsuspecting duchess, I put it down and decided to go hungry. Snacks were off the menu and The Long Kid Gloves had won. More champagne, that was the answer, and some serious people-watching.

The book broke me in the best possible way. Broke my ignorance, broke my indifference, broke my casual selfishness, broke my heart. Seriously, if you have not read this book, do so soon.
Firstly, Hypnotherapy and Psychotherapy are both excellent aids to help control emotional stress associated with vitiligo and other skin diseases(1). In one study conducted in Russia, not only were psychological problems eliminated but the researchers also observed marked repigmentation in over 20% of cases and that the period necessary to achieve marked repigmentation (i.e. of more than 50%) was twice as fast with psychotherapy.
Offering hope is more than simply being a blind optimist. Truly great leaders set and articulate a clear and concise vision that allows followers to see past problems towards a better future.

I need some perking up this morning. it is wet and gloomy today and I thought this would be the perfect card to cased. Here is the card I cased from Jen's blog ( Simple and Sincere) that has such a nice and simple layout, yet has this gorgeous design. I basically changed the layout and the colors but the concept is still the same. I added those cute Itty Bitty Shapes flowers and a scallop oval punch to my sentiment. Hope you like it.

Philip Cowell, Director of the Readers and Writers programme at English PEN commented on stage, "Writing is a brave thing to do. It is a true expression of free speech and it is a very brave thing to come up on stage and to read your work." English PEN campaigns for freedom of speech for all writers wherever they are in the world and fundraises for projects in prisons and with refugees and asylum seekers to ensure they also have access to opportunities to write and be heard.
I was in the second grade when a Sunday School teacher become quite upset with me because I add "thank you God for the birds that sing" to the end of a chain prayer. I was told it was inappropriate and I should find something more serious to pray about or for. My feelings were so hurt I bolted from the room. It was the moment I became a pray-er...a silent pray-er.

So when I talk about loving Allah I will love Him completely, and in my heart there is no room for love for anybody else. For the sake of Allah, I will love those whom He orders me to love, not for my own sake. It could be that this man has big ears and a long nose. Maybe he likes chicken doner, while I like lamb diner – I do like lamb doner, it’s true, but this doesn’t mean I am going to disavow him. “Oh, he doesn’t like lamb doner, I’m not going to be friends with him.”
- ultimately it is people bashing. The ‘church’ is actually embodied in local a congregation of all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds. Are they culminatively responsible for the marginalisation of the church in the West? Are they to be made to feel guilty for such failure? How constructive can such a blame game be?

In January 2007 the New York Times ran a bit of puff piece about Ms. Burden in which Ms. Burden was credited in changing the Atlantic Yards megadevelopment for the better; not by eliminating the superblocking as referred to in the 2005 Observer article, but by limiting the size of Atlantic Yards “behind-the-scenes.” (See: Once at Cotillions, Now Reshaping the Cityscape, By Diane Cardwell, January 15, 2007)

I did put the thought out of my head, because the onset certainly didn't point to fracture, but over the last few weeks, the recovery has been eerily reminiscent of the stress reaction a year ago. No pain, but the same weakness, the same fatigue, the same general "wtf, my leg doesn't work" feeling, and oh yeah, I couldn't hop on it. So yeah, I can't say I'm surprised.

So has my journey been all sunshine and Vegan cupcakes? No, it wouldn’t be realistic to say there haven’t been struggles or obstacles along the way but I see them as learning experiences. I would be lying if I said I didn’t sometimes miss or get cravings for some of the things I used to eat but no craving or desire could ever outweigh the suffering that satisfying that momentary wanting would cause. When I was hospitalized last winter, they couldn’t figure out how to feed me. They kept sending up vegetarian trays with eggs, cheese and non-dairy creamer that contained whey. Even the hospital dietician was challenged by my requests and I ended up eating salad and chickpeas for 3 days. I have gone to events where the only things I could eat were olives and pickles so I have learned to plan ahead and either eat first or bring my own food. It takes some more effort to buy shampoo and make-up because I have to read all the labels and be assured they are cruelty-free. It took me months to find a coat sans wool and fur I could afford and I pose a challenge for every shoe salesperson. With every bite, with every purchase, I have a choice and I always choose Veganism.

However, at no time, is there any doubt who is the lioness that leads the pride.

This is my second crack at writing this. The problem with my first crack is that it was 540 words long and basically only talked about how Bob Dylan came to write 'Like a Rolling Stone' which is intriguing but you really need the rest of the chapter to understand what was so important about the song and how he wrote it. Very briefly then: by May 1963 Dylan had had it with the whole music industry, his celebrity status and especially the press and their inane questions; he got on his bike (literally) sans guitar and drove off to a remote cabin in Woodstock with every intention of writing a novel. That never happened. After a few days acclimatising himself to the quiet he did get the urge to write but it wasn't a novel. Dylan says:
“Far from joining hands with CAMRA round the birthday cake, some craft brewers and beer writers have chosen this year of all years to attack the campaign for – and I almost have to suspend disbelief as I type these words – refusing to embrace keg beer.”

I see both sides of the debate. Of course I’m all for more people biking—to work, for enjoyment, as a simple, healthy, efficient mode of transportation. But I also think New York is such a “concrete jungle". On some level, it is about the cars and buildings and grit and lawlessness, and that’s what we love about it. At the end of the day, it’s not supposed to be a soft, easy place to live.
Cameron just finished up his first year as a Cubbie at Awana Club!

Dear Honorable Judge,
As the media dispersed, Lindros sat, enjoying a few laughs with LeClair, Bob Kelly, and more. He signed a few pucks for the organization, a picture for Kelly, and a jacket for Reggie Leach’s young grandson, who was puttering around the locker room as if he were just mesmerized by a shooting star. As little Leach stared at the behemoth of a man (6-foot-5, for those that do not recall), Lindros talked with him about school, about treating his teachers right, doing his homework and catching up on the work he is missing by being here for the festivities. The tyke walked away like he had been given a message from God himself, while Lindros craned his head around the room. He took one last look at the legends and role players that donned the Orange and Black before, with, and after him. The former league MVP slowly walked out of the Philadelphia Flyers locker room, as he had done so many times.

Some authors reject the sense of “create,” including Irwin, whom the footnote cites as supporting the translation “create” or “establish.” Irwin, like Bruce Vawter in later decades, appears to find the premortal Christ in Proverbs’ Wisdom and so insists the being was begotten but also always existed. This goes back to a note in Gesenius’ lexicon, which points to a “Sermon on the Divine Sonship of the Messiah” for an argument against the idea of “create” for the root (in reality, it goes back to the early christological debates). This is linked with the modern fundamentalist obfuscation found in the footnote above, namely that “possess” avoids the problem of insisting God did not have wisdom forever. The real concern is whether or not Christ was created, and the footnote tries to skirt the problem by insisting that “wisdom existed before creation,” as if existing before the creation of the heavens and earth means “uncreated.” The possibility that something was created before the creation of the heavens and the earth is tacitly rejected here. (If one asks why there are depths before the creation of the heavens and the earth, though, the answer will always be that God created it beforehand.)

According to the New York Times, the court found that it was the responsibility of trade mark owners, and not online retailers, to police the online sites for infringers.

Gone, Gone, Gone was.. amazing. It grabs onto your heart in the first few pages, and never ever lets go.

Because a book with this level of awesome can not be a fluke. Her words, her images, her descriptions, they all just consume you, and immerse you into this world that is.. real- and haunting- and wonderful all at the same time. When two people find safety in each other, it is always wonderful, and this is no exception.

Power was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914, the only son of Helen Emma "Patia" (née Reaume) and the English-born American stage and screen actor Tyrone Power, Sr. Power was descended from a long theatrical line going back to his great-grandfather, the actor and comedian Tyrone Power (1795-1841). His father's ancestry included Irish, English, and Protestant French Huguenots (the latter through his paternal grandmother's Lavenu and Blossett ancestors). His mother had Catholic French Canadian (through the Reaume family) and German (from Alsace-Lorraine) ancestry. Through his paternal great-grandmother, Anne Gilbert, Power was related to the actor Laurence Olivier; through his paternal grandmother, stage actress Ethel Lavenu, he was related by marriage to author Evelyn Waugh, and through his father's first cousin, Norah Emily Gorman Power, he was related to the theatrical director Sir (William) Tyrone Guthrie, founder of the Stratford Festival (now the Stratford Shakespeare Festival) in Canada and the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[Auster wrote:] Tanstaafl is just wrong to say that the First Law of Majority-Minority Relations in Liberal Society is about Jews and that I’m covering that up.You misrepresent my position. I did not claim that MMRILS is about Jews, or that you are covering this up. I made the assertion that I believe your MMRILS should apply also to Jews.The First Law is about conspicuously different minorities who are perceived as minorities, and who are perceived as dysfunctional, unassimilable, alien or hostile. Since Jews are not generally seen these ways, except by anti-Semites, the First Law does not apply to Jews, though some aspects of it may apply some of the time.By this logic, since any minorities who are perceived as minorities, and who are perceived as dysfunctional, unassimilable, alien or hostile are not generally seen these ways, except by racists, one could say that your First Law doesn’t apply at all. It’s your Law. You can define it however you like. I find it a valuable insight that reveals an unpleasant truth. Your original definition—:The worse any designated minority or alien group behaves in a liberal society, the bigger become the lies of Political Correctness in covering up for that group.—didn’t hinge at all on “dysfunctional and unassimilable”. The variations you’ve made since show that the idea is somewhat flexible.

Not too much has changed in what I’m looking for since this post in September. I still have a fairly narrow focus—romance, women’s fiction, and female-focused erotica—but I’ve decided to add cozy mysteries to the mix. In terms of romance, I’m looking for all types of adult romance (in other words, not YA). I had some success in 2011 with historical and inspirational romance, and would like plenty more of those, but I’d like to see contemporaries and books with high sensuality too. With my editorial background at Harlequin, I am open to category romance submissions. I will warn you now that I have been very tough on my romantic suspense and paranormal submissions. I’m still looking for books in both areas, but they have to be phenomenal to keep my attention. Please note that I’m not looking for fantasy, sci-fi, YA, novellas, or nonfiction.

Apparently, the market in recent years was thought to have hit bottom twice before.
“Hundreds and thousands, possibly millions, of people every night in England read something in bed. They say nothing about it except, ‘I read for a little last night and then slept like a top,’ or ‘I didn’t feel like going to sleep last night, so I read for a bit,’ or ‘I began reading so-and-so in bed last night, and damn the book, I couldn’t get to sleep until I finished it.’ Usually nothing at all is said; if anything is said it is very little. Yet what a large slice of each of our lives has gone into this harmless occupation.

Rather, physical and digital sales today are more like the horse and the auto relationship of 100 years ago. At that time, automobiles, like digital sales today, were coming into their own and represented a significant part of the market. But the horse was still there and still represented the reality of travel to a lot of people much as the physical box of software does today.

...a harsh climate and a hard landscape toughen people. A low-lying, dank place tends to be lowering to the spirits, and we all know that constant wind drives people mad and of course she's right; it's another psychological reality. But to entertain such a notion in fiction is not, technically, to employ pathetic fallacy - at least in Ruskin's definition - unless you are using personification.
Good morning folks,
June 2010 – School ends in Sherwood on the 16th. House has already been packed and hauled off by the 15th. We head down the road and find out on the way that we have finally closed on the house in California. Boy was that cutting it close. We moved in on the 18th. Although we have officially moved in – there are still boxes. We never really unpacked in Oregon, and some things have been in boxes since Jan. 2009, but we are getting settled.

How many of us set our hearts on something and forget to see the bigger picture? We listen to what people say about how impossible our goals are. Like Arenas, we're asked to sit on the bench. Arenas inspires me because he has proven to the world that he is not a zero (literally, he changed his number). And yes, he made some bad choices during the 2009-10 NBA season but he has also made some good ones too. His story inspires me to get back up and play with heart.

Since that time, I’ve actually travelled a little, as have my grandparents, and thus I have picked up a few foreign coins. Mostly, I have Canadian coins, which are not at all uncommon in the US. I do have a few coins from Mexico, Uruguay, Honduras, and a dollar coin from the EU, courtesy of my Little. I also have a few trinkets of no monetary value, such things as arcade credits, memorial coins, and other miscellaneous assortments.

This plot will gnaw on you, but: the Arizona ranch of Cole Hillman (Rory Calhoun) is being overrun with hungry little rabbits, but being a humane type of ranch owner he wants to employ an ecologically sound control method. As a favor to his old college buddy (Cowboy College?), college president Elgin Clark (DeForest Kelley) calls in zoologist Roy Bennett (Stuart Whitman) for assistance, who in turn develops a method with his wife Gerry (Janet Leigh) to inject rabbits with hormones and genetically mutated blood so as to stunt their reproduction.
Archibald’s dream meant a great deal of travel, in exploration and surveying, and a great deal of frustration at the slow pace of Chinese life. But alongside the Littles’ interest in and huge sympathy for the Chinese people – whom they saw as being the victims of an inert and corrupt government in which all decisions were taken on the basis of a thousand-year-old ‘tradition’ irrelevant to the nineteenth century – was horror at the effects of the customary foot-binding which crippled women in pursuit of the ideal of tiny feet. Archibald had already noted that its effect was to force women to kneel to carry out agricultural labour, because they could not stand; and women who could barely walk were often forced to haul junks and barges.

Now, brownies usually fall into the category of muffins for me. I cheer when they're successful, but more often than not, I'm disappointed in the result. I just can't seem to find that balance of fluffy and dense that makes it just perfect. My brownies this time were a bit on the fluffier side but still one of my best efforts to date. I'd much rather make a cake...or cupcakes...or bread. Those are like old reliable for me. Always consistent. Always as expected.

But Thomas’ apparent strength was also his weakness. When Jesus appeared to the 10 apostles on that first Easter evening, Thomas was for some reason absent. We’re not told why he wasn’t there. Some have speculated that he may have felt that he was strong and didn’t need the fellowship of the others. Others have thought that he may have been disillusioned because Jesus had been killed, and it looked as though the whole Jesus movement was going to end. Perhaps He wondered whether he had been deceived after all. He may even have thought that if the plan was to kill Jesus, then the disciples would be the next to go. It was safer not to be near the other disciples.

Smells like a winter warmer. Malty, not too hoppy, slightly peppery. And you know, it smells so much like a warmer that I looked it up online just to check. Sure enough, their site says to look for it in the Winter of 2008, but this doesn't look like it was bottled that long ago. Maybe this is the third release of this recipe. Whatever, it smells good so far even if it presents a space-time anomaly.

After talking with D last night (well, it was quite one-sided) about the boy who’d been picking on her – it continued at the SN Playground yesterday – I wrote a note in her home-school diary asking that he sit nowhere near her and had a chat to her (more approachable) Thursday and Friday teacher today about the situation. She will keep an eye on things but I’m also going to formally request that D is not in a class with the bullying child from September. Enough is enough! I have asked D why she doesn’t tell him to stop it but she’s worried about being told off. There are two parallel classes so I can’t see that being a problem.

“…we may be supplied with as good wholesome drink at home and at a cheaper rate than any we can import from England. I could particularize many instances to prove the truth of this assertion, from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, Leith and other places; but I shall confine myself to one at present; and that is, Mr Hugh Bell of this city. This gentleman occupies a most extensive brewery, and, without partiality to the manufactures of my own country, I may safely aver, that no brewer in Great Britain furnishes better malt liquors of the different kinds and prices than he does. His strong beer, or ale, known by the name of Bell’s Beer, is famed both at home and abroad. His small beer, too, is of an excellent quality, and, if properly managed, will keep twelve months, being but little inferior to that which is drunk here in public houses under the appellation of London Porter. Private families may be supplied with it, being good, wholesome drink, at a little more than a penny a bottle. Mr Bell has not yet attempted to brew Porter, his demands for different sorts of ale being very considerable.” This seems quite clear. Loch lists a number of porter brewers, and explicitly mentions Hugh Bell as a brewer who does not make porter. If we were still to assume that black cork was porter, we would have to assume that Bell began brewing it at some point in the subsequent ten years and that Brodie and his chums began drinking it. Not an entirely impossible scenario, but probably less likely than black cork being Bell’s already famous strong ale.
God is good because He took the entire situation out of our hands early on the morning of the Saturday after Thanksgiving. I delivered or passed the baby at about 2:30 AM and, thanks to the help of my sister and niece, was taken, with the baby, to the hospital via ambulance. Our doctor was there for us, at least in spirit, as he answered many phone calls at all hours of the day and night throughout the course of the entire situation. As I said, he is a good man, just misguided at times.

It was on this day, April 30, 1989, Sergio Leone died. An Italian film director, producer and screenwriter most associated with the “Spaghetti Western” genre. his movies include The Last Days of Pompeii, The Colossus of Rhodes, the Dollars Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), Once Upon a Time in the West, Duck, You Sucker! and Once Upon a Time in America. Leone’s film-making style includes juxtaposing extreme close-up shots with lengthy long shots. He was 60 years old.
Ignoring the statue, Sharia made a quick circuit of the chamber, sticking her nose down every corridor in hopes of detecting the scent of fresh desert air. Like earlier, none of the passages were promising: either choked with sand, dead of any breeze, scent or sign of life, or else they contained vile stenches that turned Sharia’s stomach and made her skin crawl. Returning to the corridor she arrived in, she could hear the far off ringing of footsteps approaching. She brushed away her footprints in the sand covered floor, then she walked with exaggerated steps toward the foulest smelling passage. Near the doorway, she pulled her knife and cut a buckle from her sandal. She tossed it into the doorway where it would be noticed, then ran to crouch behind the statue.

So then I decided I'd just make bread. And I found this recipe. Which also sounded pretty good, except I didn't have 4-5 bananas, I had 3 (but they were HUGE so the probably counted as 4-5).

My firstborn was a dreadful baby, seriously it is lucky I had taken a year off work to stay home with her because no babysitter would have done it. She was colicky from day 2, you think I exaggerate but the nurses in the hospital would not keep her in the nursery because she was "too disruptive to the other babies". Really, too disruptive at the age of 2 days, I can only imagine what her future will hold. :) She had to be held at all times and even with that we had 5 hours of nonstop screaming all night. Ugh...I read everything I could on the subject and tried everything. Baby-wearing (carrying in a sling) helped immensely except for it intensified her need to be next to me at all times including napping and sleeping, meaning if I tried to let her sleep in her crib she screamed her bloody head off. The crying it out suggestion never met a child with willpower like mine. The situation was resolved finally when she was 6 months old and decided she would like some space and the kid was as good as gold pretty much ever since.

Food. For six weeks or more each fall and winter, it's all we can think about. Thanksgiving. Holiday parties. Christmas dinner. New Year's Eve parties. And then parties for bowl games and the SuperBowl. It's a lot of calories consumed, not to mention a lot of leftovers wasted. All at a time when our county food pantries are seeing a 25 percent jump in need compared with last year.
It's wonderful. It's intensive. Rarely is it mindless.
10.Reaves White County Ramblers - Shortening Bread
This book was hard to put down. There were moments that truly gripped me and made me grieve for the characters. There is a moment in the book when Jasper Jamieson, Caroline’s father, is considering his life, how he has coped with tragedy and grief, and a particular quote that ended with, “All one knows is there may be no tomorrow”. This quote affected me because it’s an issue I have been thinking about quite a bit lately. There are so many days in which I am just trying to make it through the day and not really “living in the moment”. It’s really depressing to think there might not be a tomorrow….We need to live each day fully, which I admit, I haven’t been doing. Needless to say, I loved this story and it has given me a great deal to think about in regards to my own family members.
So that was Halloween, or at least the night before, and there was nothing to do on Halloween itself or any time near Halloween, as my back was still hurting a bit and I was afraid of going to a haunting house or anything that might make my condition worse. Too late I thought of going to the wax museum, as they are usually very tame, and I'm sure that someone would have let me out early if I was having a problem. So I didn't get to do anything at all this year, other than the party.

Is Matthew comparing Nazarene and netser (or natsar) or Nazarene and Nazarite? That is illogical, for there is no basis for either claim. The reason why Matthew 2:23 have Jesus being called Nazarene (Greek, “Nazoraios”) is because he lived in Nazareth (Greek, “Nazaret”). It has nothing to do with netser, natsar, or nazir. Matthew and later Bible interpreters are just playing with words.

I chose it and he actually bought it. He asked me to please wear flats. Found that strange, but whatever. I went over (in my cute new flats), brought him a nice bottle of wine and we actually made fresh pasta and dinner. Dinner was great, the movie was fun, we did a little making out. We had two bottles of wine…ut oh. I couldn’t drive home and I spent the night. Did I say ut oh?

So another clue leads nowhere. Neither my genetic history nor, it would appear, a childhood operation have any part to play in the development of my bronchiectasis. Of the operation itself I have no particular memory. Post operatively there was bad news and good news. The bad news was the disgusting semolina I was fed daily for a while. The good news was the ice cream.
This is how I heard the news -- an early morning phone call from Bill Yankee, my friend and personal trainer in Key West --who always wanted to be the first, he said, to congratulate someone who'd made it into the NJ Hall of Fame.

On his website, Massimo all too often devalues his arguments by being so obviously defensive about his turf. In this case, Pigliucci should have deep-sixed the Oedipus argument, which makes him look a bit petty. Stick with the critique and forget the psychoanalysis. Still, I think we do need to take seriously Massimo’s defenses of philosophy. After all, the man has degrees in both science and philosophy.

We all of us carry around a colourful mental image of the Tudor Age, composed partly of the myths they told themselves and those added by succeeding centuries, particularly by Hollywood – the voracious Henry VIII, all swaggering shoulders and booming voice, Elizabeth with her astonishing ruffs and smooth, white face above jewel-encrusted, heavily embroidered dresses, stepping on Raleigh’s cloak, ‘not making windows into men’s souls’, and consulting Dee to forecast the future. Some of this may be true, but it is not the full story, and to tease out Dee’s life from the dense fabric of Tudor history, and present his real historical context, has required patient attention to even the tiniest details of obscure manuscripts and books, examined again and again as the years of reading changed the way I understood them.

I first thought of baking, but, we have zilch when it comes to food so that’s a no-go.

Wonder Boy flunked his school eye exam today. This is not altogether unsurprising as Pod and I are both blind as bats, but up until his last eye exam, he had been testing at 20/20. Which was a great delight to me, and, as these things sometimes go, I was pondering only this morning about whether or not Her Majesty would end up with glasses and how fortunate Wonder Boy was to have escaped his genetic predisposition to myopia. This was not to be, unfortunately, and reminds me of my first rule of parenthood:

The liter bottle I'm sampling today was purchased for $15 at a lovely liquor store that looks like it popped right out of Mad Men, inventory and all (see picture above). The bottle has the number "82" on the bottom indicating the bottle was made in 1982, but curiously, the bottle has a tax stamp strip with no numbers which would indicate that it went to market after 1985, when tax stamps were phased out (probably from just after 1985 since they still used the strip). According to Chuck Cowdery, the company emptied the warehouses of stock after they stopped distilling, so I would guess that they either bottled a bunch of Ten High in 1982, right after the distillery closed, and released it gradually or bought bottles in 1982 and bottled it gradually until they ran out. Either way, this bourbon was likely distilled in the distillery's last years.

Just today we awoke to a gray sky and decided to stay home all day. We kissed Dad goodbye. My oldest was sniffly and stayed in bed to read. My other two boys and I snuggled on the couch and watched "Charlotte's Web." We talked about how sad the ending is, and that we almost cried, but then we didn't.

Other essays that were of high interest to me were the ones on the victim-blaming in government femicide awareness campaigns, as well as those that critically examined media representations of the victims. The mothers’testimonios in Part Three were also powerful–and painful–to read.

All of the above generalizations have been true all along, so in an important sense, the fundamentals are much the same as a week ago. Otherwise, this situation remains, as it always has been, unpredictable, and the worst case scenarios remain concerning but less probable (due to the containment structures and the water). The spent fuel pool in reactor 4 was a very concerning wildcard -- and still is under some question(!) -- as the pool held the entire offloaded core from reactor 4, and no containment structures protected that core except the water in the pool alone. (It was frightening to hear the prediction by our NRC that pool 4 was going dry!) It's unclear how low the water level got, whether the pool liner had/has any leaks, etc. That is a large wildcard, but the pool was said to have water (presuming it can hold water, which seems plausible as there is no ongoing nuclear fire, no obvious huge release), so thus the size of any release of fission products from pool #4 (which if water is now covering most of the rods in the tank would now be finished most likely) is unknown to my knowledge. Finally, regarding speculations of reactor core full meltdowns and penetrations (melt-through) of the pressure vessels (the interior vessel but not the 'containment vessel'), this seems possible for one core, but no sure thing -- it's also possible it did not happen. So long as reactor cores always held at least some water, then those vessels would not have a melt-through (as the water would simply boil and remove heat from the new masses at the floors of the vessels).
Better get the packing done before then!!!!

People are also taking notice of how he is handling the many and non-stopping ‘Gates’ that keep opening up. For example he had the cow-gate, the anak-gate, the aman-gate, the toll-gate, the timber-gate, the MAS-gate, etc. The rakyat are trading endless stories about these gates that Najib somehow gives the impression that he is totally helpless and unable to shut either.

Obviously this mode of transportation is not for everybody or will it work everywhere. First of all over 30% of the population is overweight and obese. Ain’t gonna happen. Others are old and frail. Not for them. Parts of the country are cold and snowy for 3 to 5 months out of the year. Might get a few months of use during the summer if it’s not raining. I do predict that you will start seeing many more of these gas powered bicycles though in the near new future. For some it will be a choice, for others it will be the best alternative.

Jack took longer to be able to heal himself and only when he completes the acts of liberating "the monster"/Locke on "Island" and Locke in the Sideways" was he able to see truth and free himself. I believe this is why we're led to believe "MIB" "assumed" Locke's ID; it was because Jack had to literally face the one person/Locke on the "Island" who represented his opposition/negative, the one who challenged him most.

The second, multi-part scenario, “Raid on Innsmouth” looks much more entertaining. Not only does it give the PCs a chance to be active participants in Lovecraftian canon (the government raid and the torpedoing of Devil’s Reef), but it is designed to give each individual PC a chance to shine as the star of their own mission.
Situated at 1860 Santa Fe Avenue in Barrio Norte, the building was designed by the architects Peró and Torres Armengol for the empresario Max Glucksman (1875-1946), and opened as a theatre named Teatro Gran Splendid in May 1919. The ecleticist building features ceiling frescoespainted by the Italian artist Nazareno Orlandi, and caryatids sculpted by Troiano Troiani (whose work also graces the cornice along the Buenos Aires City Legislature.
So a workshop on historical fiction has the dual focus of Now, and Then, because, as I argued a few months ago, the historical novel is in some ways the ultimate novel: it embodies all the opportunities - and so difficulties - of writing fiction, but in peculiarly acute form. Between now and September I've got to sharpen my pencil (or my keyboard) and plan exercises to tackle these things: how you research... and let go of the research; how you find the voices of history... and make them come alive to the modern reader; how you make us care so passionately about your characters that we'll stay up late reading about this strange and long-ago world... and yet be all wobbly by the end because these people we've lived with aren't Now, they're Then.

It goes without saying that there are showbiz people out there who take up non-profit activities as a PR necessity. Clooney does not belong to that category because a) he REALLY does not need publicity and b) there are less dangerous ways of boosting one’s PR and I’m positive that going to conflict zones is not one of them. His commitment stems from genuine concern for the civilian population of Sudan who has been subjected to indiscriminate air strikes by the Sudanese central government in its fight with armed rebel groups. He spent years campaigning for Darfur, well before it took prominence in the news headlines; as matter of fact, he helped shine a light on the distressing situation there.

Barnes and Noble has 965 reviews, with an average of four out of five stars, and an overall 3/4 ratio of four stars or better. Not too shabby. That works out to roughly 1,000 people who thoroughly enjoyed a recent book about vampires.

It is all to do with the singing lessons. And with a certain gullibility on Delia's part. She has fallen first of all for Mr Plummer's line that she has a gem of a voice, an un-cut diamond which he can cut and polish if Delia will only place herself in his hands. In fact Delia Greenaway's voice is nothing special. Pleasant enough but it can only become special if you consider the rest of her: the face, the dazzling hair, and of course that womanly shape. (For Oswald Plummer it is Delia's bottom that is of especial interest — as evidenced by the fact that his hand is at present handling it — but we will come to that.)

Getting caught up on my blogging after a loooong ten days or so of action-packed stuff. First up was the Dock Street Truffled Old Ale release; we got an advance tasting at the Four Seasons on January 23rd (Craig LaBan got an even advanceder tasting, and wrote this). I took the train down, endearing myself to my green friends, I'm sure, and walked over to the Four Seasons from Suburban Station...and then started really wishing I'd worn something nicer than the old nylon windbreaker I'd pulled on over sweater and jeans.

I'm really pissed. And not in the British sense. No, I'm soberly angry, and hurt.﻿ No word from Drummer. This afternoon, my talks behind me, I emailed him from the airport, 4:45pm home time. (I've thus taken down my unproductive poll on whether to do so.) I felt I had to act, just to address the remote contingency that he didn't get my email and thought I was the one disappearing.

Well, the upside was that he was listening beautifully to my aids in the upward and each time a simple squeeze sent him into the lovely forward trot. The downside was that apparently he thought he didn't need to listen to the "walk" aid and so I really had to haul on him to get him to stop.
What’s up guys this is Chase at SeductionTactics.com. Today’s topic is about how to flirt with women. It’s something that’s very key… If you want to spark that sexual chemistry in a relationship you need to begin flirting right away.

David Lodge’s A MAN OF PARTS, about H.G. Wells - disappointingly little about the great SF books, mainly because ‘HG’ wasn’t shagging anything that moved when he wrote them. Crime novels I’ve read recently are Peter May’s THE BLACKHOUSE (over-rated), Christa Faust’s MONEY SHOT (not as revealing about the making of porn movies as I’d hoped ), Tony Black’s TRUTH LIES BLEEDING (good), Megan Abbott’s QUEENPIN (excellent) and Joyce Carol Oates’ ZOMBIE (the last word on serial killers and squirm-inducing, in a good way).
Back to my Mom. She knows my many faults. I have found it rather cathartic to be vulnerable with her by telling her and accepting her telling me my faults. It was a weight off my shoulders to be so open with someone and learn that she did still love me. And the same applies to her faults, I love that I know that she is and will never be a perfect person. Sometimes I've complained about that, but in retrospect if she were perfect I don't think I could love her as I do because I would not feel ok to be vulnerable with her over my own shortcomings. It is give and take.

The boys on display are behind glass walls lining the edges of the hall. Their cages are so narrow that there’s only enough space for them to stand. They can’t move. They can barely breathe. They squint in the white light that shines down on top of their heads. The cages, blue and clear, were made so the slaves can’t see out of them. When they open their eyes, all they can see is a black mirror and a reflection of themselves. That’s what I was told, anyway, but I still feel nervous whenever I walk in front of them. I still feel their eyes following me as I pass them by.
As a vegan activist, I have always told people that the single best thing we can all do for animals is to go vegan. After some critical thought, even we vegans have to admit that that is not correct. Going vegan is only the second best thing anyone can do to help animals. The single best thing anyone can do to help animals is to not reproduce.
Which brings me back to the Pong case. It's designed to direct cell phone radiation away from your head.

Following this was a De Ranke Bitter XX and a Russian River Damnation to cap it off. Supposedly the "hoppiest beer of Belgium," the De Ranke left me wanting, but more than likely because of all the hype it's received over the years. Granted, it's an IPA Tripel, and it possessed plenty of citrusy hop and pale malt flavors, but for some reason, I'm not a fan. It could be the fusion of style that gets to me; with Belgian sugar and a hopping that seems kind of misplaced, it makes for an odd match-up. I think Houblon Chouffe really nails it, but it seems like a tough combination to brew and have it come out somewhat balanced. Maybe I just need to sit down with another one of these, but at $17 or more a bottle, I may have to hold off on picking that one up again.
I used the PBandJ image and the You and Me sentiment from the You and Me digital set and luckily found papers with just the right colors - peanut butter and jelly colors of course!! The image and sentiment were printed onto cream card stock and cut out with a Nestability. I colored the image with water color pencils and an aquabrush. I made the easel card following the instructions on SCS and decorated it with Black Market patterned papers. I printed out a second image, colored the sandwich and cut it out to provide a "stopper" for the easel card. It is attached with a foam square.

LOA is one of many universal laws that govern our universe. Common other laws you may have heard of include Newton’s Laws of motion, in particular the two laws governing equal and opposite reactions and the law of inertia. The Law of Gravity, also a common law. These laws state and can be demonstrated experimentally time and time again to be true that certain effects occur under the influence of the law in question. For example, no matter how many times you jump in the air, you will always be drawn back down, due to gravity, hence, The Law of Gravity.

All-in-all such an event certainly helps to give you a feeling of belonging to the Nikon brand. It imparts that certainty that you’ve bought into a great system and a company that knows what they’re doing. But most of all it also provides that feeling of being part of a community that boasts some of the best contemporary photographers out there.
Those of my readers who haven’t been through a magical initiation, or one of the lodge initiations (for example, those of Freemasonry) that use similar methods for the purpose of self-improvement and ethical development, may well think they have no idea what I’m talking about. Still, if you’re reading this blog and consider peak oil a real possibility, you’ve already passed through an initiation. It didn’t happen in a lodge of the Ancient Hubbertian Order of Peak Oil, granted, but there’s another kind of initiation, and that’s self-initiation.

For the past few weeks I was plagued with an irritating cough and massively sore throat which I just couldn't shift. Which in turn led to me shunning the gym and exercise in general in favour of staying inside and hibernating. Which in turn led to me feeling like a lump. Which in turn led to me feeling lazy and not being bothered enough to cook lovely, nutritious food for the family. Which in turn, probably spurred on the sicky, lumpy feeling.

It is evident by the number of fast-food pasta joints mushrooming in major Metros of India that Italian dishes are fast replacing Chinese food in popularity. Apart from availability, increase in purchasing power, and readiness to experiment global cuisine, I feel it has a lot to do with the fact that Italian cuisine makes use of fresh herbs as much as Indian cuisine does.
Yardlife Festival was meant to be this coming weekend, an non-profit festival for charity meant to be hosted in Hackney at St John Church for new music, arts and style. Planned was a vintage market, art installations and a DJ room. With a great line-up of upcoming bands to showcase their music, and the great Pete Doherty himself and more such as Gaoler’s Daughter, The Valentines and DJ Rory Phillips. I was looking forward to kick starting off my summer holidays… Only to find myself disappointed to find the news that the festival has been cancelled.

With a large turnover of fringe players likely, £30m or more might purchase three players of quality, two at least. Arsenal have moved away from reliance on one player to some extent, the summer expunging that when Fabregas left. Now it is more of a team structure in the squad, equal ability. With tweaking, few can argue that a significant foundation exists. Improve on that, in quality and mental approach, and there is a group of players that can challenge for honours.

A couple of months ago, My Mate Dave and I wrote a piece on the possible future role of nuclear power in the UK (indeed, everywhere) and how we think it’s a winner. The main obstacle we could see was the supposedly vehemently anti-nuclear Lib-Dem contingent within the then newly-formed coalition popping up to scupper proceedings. As it turns out, when you actually have to do something other than heckle from the sidelines, it has a habit of reforming your perspective:
Quoting from the Sadducee’s accepted Scriptures, the Pentateuch, Jesus takes Exodus 3:6 to show how the resurrection fulfils God’s covenant promises to his people. He is the redeeming God of the living Patriarchs. The context in Exodus is God’s saving action and covenant faithfulness to his chosen people.
These ceremonies are also about showing societal status. We hear of a funeral where a staggering 145 buffalo were slaughtered. Also, the host families are feeding hundreds of people every day. And if the meal is not up to snuff you can be sure there will be whispering at the well the next day. Dancers from wealthy families get showered with more cash. Everything is written down. When the Johnsons get your family a fancy spotted buffalo when your father dies, then you better get them the same when their dad kicks the bucket.
Either way, I’m mad at you. And my ovaries, too. Together you harmonize in a monthly rhythm - an intoxicating concoction of baby making juju. And make me walk around dreamy eyed and frantic with baby lust.
Bioregional animist psychology is focused on a concept of oneness, not unity per se but specifically oneness as unity indicates there are two things that are united or BECOME one. The difference on this point lays in that you do not become what you already are but you can become aware of what you are.[2]

“The arrests capped what officials described as a ‘painstaking investigation’ that began in June 2008 involving an F.B.I. agent who had been told by a federal informant of the men’s desire to attack targets in America.

Having already been awake and unable to sleep since 4am, I couldn't contain the sudden rush of white hot anger I felt. I started pounding on the front door until my fists hurt and screamed profanities at the top of my lungs before collapsing in a sob-choked meltdown that morphed into a paralyzing spiral of self-loathing once my girlfriend left for work. This is roughly the same reaction I would've had to adversity when I was four. It made me feel undignified, unmasculine, immature, scared, ashamed and more than a little crazy.

I took a four day time-out this weekend where I tried not to think about the issues with my mom but I couldn't totally rid myself of the worry. Every night I woke up and immediately thought about the hurdles I faced and the problems I have to solve. Because I am such an anal retentive person who needs to fix problems as soon as they arise, I've been very stressed out by this whole situation.

I came home from being out of town for a couple of days and Beau told me about it. He “forgot” to call me the second that he said it but I won’t hold it against him. Now, another disclaimer, right now he just repeats the word as in, he doesn’t use the word “mama” in reference to the person who spent 6 weeks laying in a hospital bed, 4 months in a city 1200 miles away from everything she knew, countless hours at his bedside praying and watching and hoping; thousands of dollars living in a foreign city, paying for a nanny, medicines and doctors appointments; hundreds of days cleaning up the effects of his reflux, countless wet cat wrestling matches while trying to feed his tiny self, doing leg stretches after leg stretches after leg stretches and about 22 months worrying about how he’s going to turn out…but that’s ok…we’ll get there.

Firpo's Balloon is one of Baker's more notorious drinks in this respect. Baker collected many extremely tasty libations like the Remember the Maine, the Jimmie Roosevelt, and the Hotel Nacional Special, which have turned many cocktail enthusiasts into hard-core Baker aficionados. But it is usually the Balloon, or one of the other drinks like it, that marks the time where the fascination begins to wane. Firpo's Balloon is one of those cocktails that creates skepticism, if not outright contempt. You don't even have to drink it to know something is wrong. The recipe provides all you need to know; we attempted it anyway.

I stumbled across an interesting technique while tasting this wine that I am going to try with others. A working name for this technique could be call The Depravation Method. I have found that this works well with desserts and other types of food as well. The theory goes like this: When your taste buds are satiated by a large amount of wine (or cake or ice cream) they become flooded. When they only have a small taste it creates a deprivation or lack both in the taste buds and psychologically and for me intensifies the flavors.
