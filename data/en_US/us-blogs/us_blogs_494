In vitro fertilization (IVF) is considered elective treatment – just like the cosmetic surgery she had on her face – and as such a doctor can refuse to treat as long as s/he does not have an obligation or previous relationship with a patient or working in the Emergency Room.

I have this weird ability to remember the lyrics of any song after hearing it once. I was a Gleek-type kid in high school, so I know almost every Broadway musical score written from the 1930s into the 1980s and any Top 20 song, any year. I wish I'd lived in Cole Porter’s Paris apartment about 1918.

Most solar storms produce only minor disquieting effects on Earth. Typically one might expect short-term electrical power blackouts, short-lived communication outages, rerouting of aircraft, loss of a few satellites and a beautiful “aurora borealis” in the night’s sky from a large solar storm. But as the intensity of a solar storm increases like a wild beast, the storm can begin to develop the capacity to create a major disaster on Earth. The difference in solar storm intensity is like the difference between being hit with a tropical rainstorm and being devastated by a Category 5 hurricane. The solar storm of 1-2 September 1859, which began with a solar flare so strong that it was subsequently named the Carrington Flare, was such a beast.

You will know by now that I am all about being proactive and productive when it comes to tackling both issues of the home and of the heart. And yet,there are times when even the most proactive among us need to simply back away, recognize that we cannot control everything, let our shoulders rise in a grand and glorious ‘shrug,’ and let it all go.
A few weeks ago at our big gender ultrasound, the Dr. noticed that my cervix was a little short. It wasn't a big deal at the time, it was just a little shorter than they would ideally like to see it. So they decided to keep an eye on it.
They offer nine different types of plush to start out with: Bear, Puppy, Cat, Bunny, Cow, Robot, Monster, Alien or be surprised and see what they come up with. Now these categories are just suggestions. You can actually change them around in so many ways to make them come out like so many different things. You can even check out the toys that others have made and either create that one, or change it some to make your own like it. I seen so many cute ones people have made. Some started out with one from the categories, but I seen ones that looked like monkeys, a mouse, and a moose, plus many other fun designs.

In my humble opinion, 1993 Upper Deck is the masterpiece set of the 1990s. Nothing else matches it. There are a few reasons for that, but the overriding one is that the photos, from the way they were presented to the simple decision-making that went into photo selection, are brilliant.

The Man Who Painted Agnieszka's Shoes is told in three distinct voices. We meet each of them in the first 3 chapters. Here's chapter 1. In it we meet what I guess we could call our protagonist if he could be described with such a word. Dan Griffiths is an everyman and a nobody. A 50-something magazine cover designer. The only thing remarkable about his life is what isn't in his life - his daughter, who went missing without a trace one summer's day ten years ago. But like the thousands of other missing persons she's long since been forgotten by everyone except him. He voweed to himself that he wouldn't get locked in the cycle of endlessly pretending she was still there, trapped in a single moment of grief. But the numb nothing his life has become, reduce to Friday nights at the pub with an old college friend and a once a year ritual phone call with his editor, suggests that in this, as in every other aspect of his life, he has failed.

The man who penned the Wenceslas ditty, John Mason Neale, did change around a song to tell his story. He actually took an old spring song and dumped those lyrics, replacing them with the good king. Here's the timeline on the whole shebang: Duke Wenceslas the actual person, early 10th century, Old Spring song ("Now is the time for flowering"), early 16th century, Good King Wenceslas, the Christmas Carol, 1853.
The movie eventually connects both plots, bringing us to flaw number three, that the mysticism that Antoine’s wife dabbles ends up revealing her ‘punishment’ and the justification for his adultery. It imposes this viewpoint upon her while she suffers through mental issues while all he has to do is to fall in love. This new family situation is also imposed on Antoine’s children who prefer her as the parent. But I’m making it seem more one-sided than it really is, as Antoine and his ex-wife explore their pasts, within memory or otherwise, portrayed as vividly in flashbacks. His new girlfriend joins in with the introspection, questioning the replaceable aspect of love and lovers and searching for the happiness and stability within it.

In a scene which utterly traumatised me as a child, Data (Brent Spiner) from off've Star Trek is murdered by one of the aliens. For all the unsubtle explosions and hoo-ha-ing, Independence Day has its moments of genuine creepiness and unease. It doesn't rely too much on special effects, unlike the director's most recent, duller works. Alien spaceships and slithering monsters are far more interesting to watch than John Cusack or Dennis Quaid pouting at earthquakes.

I navigate through the icy, treacherous week on one crutch. Trying not to use my hand too much. Staying off my leg as much as possible since my official diagnosis is sprained wrist, sprained ankle, sprained knee, and sprained pelvis, with possible bruised hip and bruised bones in all aforementioned areas I go to my college classes on the days when they are not cancelled and keep my leg propped up on pillows as well as my hand. I type one handed when on the computer and try to limit my texting as much as possible. Thursday - the long day at my college was the worst - I almost passed out at one point from the pain and exhaustion of it. It was a terrible day. In fact it was a terrible week. Pretty much everything hurts. The injuries hurt extremely bad but then the muscles on the other side of my body hurt because they are compensating extra hard trying to move me around on the crutches being used in ways they are not used to being used. It is making me grumpy and over-emotional. I do not like not being able to do things for myself - I am EXTREMELY and TEARFULLY grateful to the friends that have come over and visited or helped out and to the friends who have called or emailed to check on me or chat. I am also grateful to the friends at school who have offered to take notes for me or help me navigate from class to class or carry things for me. I am also grateful the friends who have agreed to meet me on campus and carry my lunch tray so I will be able to eat - even though classes were cancelled and it didn't happen. Thank you to everyone!!! I still need that help keep it coming. I am overwhelmed by how you are there for me and I appreciate every second of it and I won't forget it ever. You are really showing me who my true friends are. The kindness is really appreciated right now.
I am happy.

Mayo is known for its temperature extremes. From http://www.taiga.net/yourYukon/col112.html: Mayo set the record for the Yukon's extreme high on June 14, 1969, when the thermometer topped out at 36.1 degrees Celsius. The extreme low for that community, -62.2 degrees Celsius, was recorded in 1947. With a difference of 98.3 degrees Celsius between the extreme high and low temperatures, Mayo holds the Canadian record for the greatest range of absolute temperatures.

It was about 9:15-30am and the pushing started. For some reason I was most unprepared for this part of labor.

Unfortunately with your first labor, lying on your back, unprepared, and without an epidural, pushing isn’t easy!
Hugo fixes things and keeps the train station clocks running for his uncle—skills he learned from his father (Jude Law, Sherlock Holmes), a clock maker and tinkerer.

Hugo needs to find that key to unlock the secret he believes it contains.

I just wanted to update everyone on the situation. I sent numerous texts (all saved/screenshot) to my former boss (FB from this point on, just to save time) and did not receive responses. Because my actual payday would have been October 1st, I decided to give her until October 5th to send a check. I told her all of this in texts/voicemails during the first week of October. On the 5th, I took my information to the local court and filed a small claim against her for the $220 I'm owed. Afterward, I sent her one last text that said, "I waited until the 5th and had to assume you were not going to pay me. I have filed a claim and will talk to you about the issue in court." That night, she left me a voicemail (my phone never rang, though, because I was out of range when she called - I would've answered otherwise,) saying that since I "didn't come to pick up my check on the 1st", she had sent it out that day and I would receive it shortly.

Develop a strong spiritual practice. Decide that you are worth it. Meditate daily, this is a must do. It does not have to be long. It just needs to be done. Take a moment and focus on your breath, your heart beat, the heart beat of mother earth….and when you feel all of your hearts beating together, ask, explore and listen. Set the intent to have a great day filled with kind, loving and gentle people. To be in that place of peace and shine brightly for others to feel your love, and a day filled with miracles, both experienced and witnessed as you go about your day. You have all the tools, assistance and wisdom available to you, it is up to you to utilize them now. Get really clear on what you desire (not how you desire it to come) and then be open to receive. Let the guides and the angels have the details, keep your eyes on the feeling of the desired outcome and celebrate each moment of the journey while you get there.

No, we're not detailing the 2008 auto models, we’re talking about mini-vandaceous orchids here. There’s been a growing interest in mini-catts, or miniature cattleya hybrids, and for good reason: they don’t take up much space, often flower more than once a year, come in a range of bright colors, and some are quite fragrant, too. What’s not to like? But all these reasons hold true for miniature vandaceous orchids as well, and yet they don’t seem to get the same respect. This article hopes to correct the imbalance.

But we found a place in a neighboring town that will take pretty much everything. So we went there and got 10 dollars for all our bottles!

Well, of course, this logic is flawed for several reasons; one of them being that there is evidence that the rates of erosion, sedimentation, and the magnetic field decay rate have indeed varied. However, the rate of radiometric decay is another story; it has been tested and observed under numerous, extreme conditions and yet the rate hadn’t been altered. There were three instances where half-lives have been altered, but they are irrelevant to the conventional dating methods and do not affect the dates of rocks either on earth or on other planets, as two of them are extraterrestrial (i.e., fast-moving matter in space though no rock in our solar system is moving fast enough to affect the date, and physical conditions at the center of stars).
When my grandmother and her family came to America in 1913, they brought with them what would become a tradition of "backyard farming" -- chickens, fruit trees, a few pigs, and tomatoes. They made their own pork sausage in the basement, dried tomato paste on their tin roof, and the canned tomato sauce to last the winter. My "big nana" (great grandmother) never learned to speak English, unlike her children who Americanized as quickly as possible, but she spoke to me through food every time I sat in her kitchen during summer visits to Pennsylvania. I guess this is where my farming heritage comes from ... it's the only explanation I have for the goats in my backyard, tomato seedlings in my kitchen window, and chickens pecking in a side yard coop!

Having battled through it just over three years ago now, I had that light at the end of the tunnel. I stopped taking my anti-depressants, which were Citalopram and life was looking a little more rosy. I’d started a new job, made some new friends and moved in with some lovely people in Merstham. I was dating again after splitting up with my alcoholic ex and was meeting some nice guys out there for a change after years of random assholes. For a month or so I was dating a different guy twice a week. My confidence had grown. I’d got over my aunt trying to steal my identity and though I was pissed at it, it didn’t depress me. Work was great, I loved every minute of it and used to joke that I’d work for free as I liked it that much. The pay wasn’t fantastic but after a few months on Job Seekers Allowance it was a lot better and it paid my rent to my awesome landlord. I was getting on well with my mum too, which is something that didn’t go too well the years preceeding. Life wasn’t bad.

If we were to ask local citizens what they feel about having a new library, I’m sure we would hear a variety of answers. I would like to share with you some of my observations and feelings. Our library reflects the heart of our community. It is a place where people of all ages, backgrounds and interests gather to learn, to imagine, to communicate, to improve, to relax and to share. To some, it is like a home away from home, a place to be with others, a place to have time alone.

Filling the HLT was the first hurdle but that's an easy one to overcome. I simply half fill the HLT from the tap before moving into position and then filling to the required level using a spare bucket.
This baby is one-of-a-kind! I had that adorable b-a-b-y pennant set (but only one) and couldn't WAIT to make it into a card. This is another large, 5x7 beauty. Those raised dots (a Big Shot creation) are so sweet. The flower has a lot of soft dimension.

"I kinda like it like that., Son. I'll make them all that way." So he did.
When we started this process we were a clean slate, meaning that we were open to all areas of the world (including USA) for our adoption. We really wanted to learn about the different pathways of adoption and let the Lord guide us to where we needed to go to get our baby. We fell in love with Ethiopia RIGHT AWAY but wanted to research everywhere else to make sure we were going into this with our hearts AND minds. So we did. And after many discussions and T-charts, we knew where we were meant to be--Ethiopia.

So what happens next? Good question. Is it a marketable manuscript? Probably not. At least not in its current form. Too personal. An intriguing storyline I believe, but the main characters bear just a little too much of a resemblance to their creator and his circle.

Music bloggers and casual rap fans wait with bated breath any time Kanye West puts out an album and declare the last and next Roots album a classic and wish to the heavens that OutKast will some day make another album. People are losing their minds waiting for Dr. Dre to finish Detox, the album he’s supposedly been working on for almost 10 years. And yet there’s KRS the Teacha, a unanimous “Greatest of All Time” on everyone’s shortlist no matter the criteria, and he’s not just still alive, or still recording… he’s making some of his strongest albums ever.

"For the first time, e-book authors can now publish for free and keep the entire sale price of their e-book. That means if an e-book is sold for $4.99 through the Booktango bookstore, the author gets the full $4.99," said Chris Bass, Director of Marketing for Booktango. "If it's sold through another outlet, the e-books retailer takes their standard fee, and the author gets the rest. Booktango takes nothing -- no other publishing company is offering anything this beneficial to authors."

Grandma leaves and we are about to clear the scene when I suggest that we hang outside the home to see what kind of state of mind the mom was going to be in. This is something I like to do sometimes because of personal experience in law enforcement. You don’t run off even know we want to. We hang outside the residence and just listen. Not two minutes later mom is screaming. Screaming like the worst kind you can image. I thought she was sawing off her arms and legs with the kind of noise she was making. We knock on the door to check on her and she is FREAKING out. We told her to calm down or we would be force to take her to the hospital for her well being. She told us to leave her alone and slammed the door in our face. We hang out and Sgt thanks me (this doesn’t happen much) for advising to hang out. He asks if I believe that she might be suicidal. I told him sarcastically “your three kids just got taken away from you and you’re probably going to prison for hurting your child, what do you think?” He told me it was my call. I told him we will wait and give her the benefit of the doubt. I’m not going to be responsible for this one. Not two seconds after I say that we hear crashes coming within the home and sounds like coming from the kitchen. We gear up, call out and wait for a few other officers that were down the street and make entry. HOUSE IS DESTROYED. That is her property and not my problem. We check on the welfare of her and she is still hysterical. Being a nice po-po I tell her she has two choices, going to the hospital with us or calling a friend. She tells me F you and starts to hop backwards away from us. Remember she had a broken leg and the house is a mess. TASERS OUT. Funny how that little red dot mellows people out. Also for the entire none police that don’t understand this. I’m not going to wrestle on broken glass and furniture and get myself hurt. She chills out and we call one of her friends out to stay with her. The end for now…….. We will return, I guaranteed it.
Elliott has a decent enough pedigree and shows in glimpses what he can do but put simply, he just doesn’t score enough goals. With Elliott marked as another high earner, I wouldn’t be surprised to see him go but there really will be no replacement. Hearts haven’t found a regular 15 goal striker since Andrius Velicka or, further back, Mark De Vries. With the midfield not scoring their quota then it could continue to be tough up top for Hearts especially if they want to cling on to that fourth European spot.
So I am at my computer trying to think of something to write cause I love getting more people to talk about the battle against mediocrity, I also love hearing others stories, but I am looking at my tablet and seeing in my notes that my total debt is at $25,027. And while I know that is a good amount of money, at the same time it really is not! It just is not, an extra job, longer hours, something can be done, and it is driving me nuts sitting here are the computer when there is something that can be done!

Of course a painting can also run the gamut, that is, it can be keyed not to a section of the value scale, but to the entire value scale and have all of the values from ink to pure white on the canvas. That is probably the most common key in practice. You get a lot of those on sunny days. It is nice to know how to raise the key of a painting a little when you are out on a gray or dark day. Keying up a rainy day or gray day picture can save it from being lugubrious.
As to those home-baked cakes: the woman at the neighbouring table told me she was treating herself to a visit here every month and she wanted to try a different cake each time. That means she’ll be having a different cake on every visit for the next year or more, if my adding up yesterday is anything to go by. They’re baked on-site fresh every day. We chose carrot cake this time, but the choice is vast, so good luck if you’re on a one-off visit as we were.

Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium heat. Grill the chicken for 6-7 minutes per side (depending on how thick the chicken breasts are), until the chicken is no longer pink in the center (if you have a meat thermometer, the chicken should register 165 degrees). Tent with foil and let the chicken rest for about five minutes before serving. This recipe would also work well to make tasty chicken kebabs. Simply marinate chunks of chicken according to the directions above.

Giving presents is easy. Oh sure, some may claim to be stressed about the possibility that the recipient won’t enjoy or appreciate what you spent minutes picking out for them. But in reality, most people, regardless of what you wrapped up in your finest tacky Santa Snowman Rudolph Jingle Balls Birthday paper, will put on a happy face and give you a big ol’ hug and/or kiss and wish you a Merry McSomething. If you know the person well enough, or they simply have no pokerface, then you may indeed go home feeling like shit, knowing you had a shitty gift. But no matter what the case may be, just assume the best and give in to whatever their reaction is. Don’t try and dissect if it’s fake or not, by staring them down and asking dumb questions.

As Catholic Christians, then, it is our duty not only to stamp out any form of bullying (itself a grave sin against charity and justice), but also to encourage young people who have fallen into the sin of despair - either through their own fault, or the temptations and pitfalls of an overly sexualised or sometimes truly bigoted society. We also have the duty to offer hope: that life can get better, that adulthood is sometimes not as bad as adolescence. But our hope is not grounded in the premise that life becomes more fulfilling through self-gratifying sexual exploration, but rather that we become truly alive through the exploration of God's love.

The recipe below is for the original loaf cake, but to make cupcakes is simple enough. I must have been distracted while I was making these, because I didn't note the baking time for the cupcakes. However, I think it would be safe to give them 15 minutes before checking on them (since they are so moist) and going from there. This could also be made into a round or square cake quite easily.
Following the JCA Secret Samurai, I had a Secret Santa the same week for my fellowship. I took it upon myself to plan and run the entire exchange this year, using the super-useful Elfster website. It lets you plug everyone’s emails in, sends them invites, and does all the work of drawing names for you. Also, you can ask anonymous questions to your giftee to get a better idea of what they’d want. Last year, I actually got Pastor Eddie as my person, and decided to get him some nice teas from a local place called Tealuxe. Due to the success of that plan last year, I tried to repeat it again this year for my giftee, but my question through Elfster didn’t go too well.

If you really want to get a picture of how a true leader should act, I would suggest watching Mel Gibson’s character in the movie Braveheart. That character inspired the whole country of Scotland to stand up for it’s freedom against the tyrany of England’s rule. I not saying you should get a giant sword and start running around the countryside killing everyone who comes by your path, but his ability to inspire people was amazing. People just wanted to follow him. Those men would have run off the cliff of a mountain if he asked them to.

In my defense, I have to point out that I’m not your garden variety picky eater—I think what I have comes closer to an eating disorder. As in, I will literally gag if made to eat certain foods. As in, I get anxiety attacks when faced with certain foods. (I had a lot of these when I was younger). As in, one of the reasons I’m in therapy is because this is a life-long problem.
After the second gas stop I was incredibly grateful there were no more test sections. My leg and back were already starting to cramp up pretty good and I was just happy to finish. I ate 3 cheeseburgers after the race (I was hungry) and checked out the results. I was in third! My score would hold up and I took tenth overall in B for the day! This was my best showing in B class so far and my first trophy. I still don’t actually have it, since we left at 6 and they still hadn’t handed them out. You can’t really blame them, since there were 524 riders to score! My buddy picked it up though and I will get it eventually.
One morning I woke up and found Poopsue, Spot-the sweet little Dad, and all 5 kittens all over the bed. She was presenting her family to me! I hardly dared to pick up my head, as they might all scatter. I slowly slipped my arm out and started petting one. After a few seconds he or she was purring like a little motor boat, and the others were gone. Every morning I was able to tame another one, till they all became sociable. We had lots of fun. I found homes for several and kept the runt, my sweet little round-bellied Chubby.

I love the Start-Ups line of embellish-able (is that a word?) charms from Buttons Galore and More, they make the perfect blank canvas. We started with the Large Tags because I thought they were the perfect size for a necklace pendant. We haven’t used Alcohol Inks in a while, so I pulled those out and we decided on Greens, Blues and Purples. The Alcohol Inks dry instantly and the ink is heat set in just about a minute, so creating these charm necklaces is a quick and easy process with virtually no mess, which is important when crafting with kids!

Of course, we'll immediately turn around and ask for more, but we are definitely more encouraged than we were yesterday afternoon. Guardedly so, perhaps, but optimistic.

The next pair was, for most of us, the most demonstrably different: hops from the same farm (Misselhardt), but from Day 1 of the harvest and Day 4 of what Ludwig told us was usually a 12 day process. Day 1 had a beautifully fresh aroma, a bit on the sweet side, where Day 4 had a distinctly lemony catch to it. Very interesting; the two fields harvested were separated by 200 meters of altitude as well. There was clearly something at work here.

Helpful AND he knows how to share since I'm still recovering from the germs he shared.
Find your own sense of security, something that makes you feel safe. For me, that was my stuffed animals. For every one of my surgeries, I took a stuffed animal into the operating room with me. My stuffed animal of choice even got a hospital band of its own so that it was like we were experiencing the pain together. When you split fear or pain between 2 people, even if one of them isn’t a real person, it’s as if there’s someone holding your hand as you walk through the fire. I mean, it doesn’t make a huge difference….but it could be the difference in feeling like you have a friend beside you and feeling totally and utterly alone.
When states held their constitutional conventions, New Hampshire suggested an amendment stating that “Congress shall never disarm any citizen, unless such are or have been in actual rebellion.” In the Massachusetts convention, Samuel Adams unsuccessfully suggested an amendment that Congress shall not “prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.” In Pennsylvania, an unsuccessful proposal from Robert Whitehill held that “the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or for the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed, or real danger of public injury from individuals.”
The story behind the 1940 German version of ‘Titanic’ turned out to better than the film itself. The film was supposed to be a propaganda piece showing the arrogance and greed of us Brits, supposed traits that lead to the sinking of the unsinkable. However the Nazi true believer Walter Zerlett-Olfenius who wrote ‘Titanic’s screenplay denounced his friend and director Herbert Selpin after he’d openly made some remarks about how Hitler was mishandling the war. The director was quickly replaced, imprisoned and was soon found dead in his cell from an obviously faked suicide at the hands of Propaganda Minister Goebbels. When the film was finally released the scenes of chaos and death were far too close to the nightly destruction that the population of Germany were facing from Allied bombing raids, so Goebbels had the film shelved and banned all further performances.
An ethical project of sorts, while Ms Avins was determined enough to go to the lengths of experiencing the whole fur-making process, her experiment has still left some animal rights commentators cold.

After we finished coloring the hair we shampooed and conditioned the whole head. Beware that this color is not permanent but will definitely stay in light hair for a long time, brunettes for less time. The lighter your hair, the more vibrant. If you’re a brunette or redhead, you would have to have your hairstylist lighten the tips prior to dip dying your ponytail. Otherwise, chalking is another great temporary option.
It's a curious thing to be a woman and marry into someone else's family. You leave your name behind, and take his. It becomes part of who you are now. I don't begrudge that at all. But, even if you don't have what your name was anymore, it never stops being a part of who you are.

As we now understand more about the psychology and health of dogs, we now see that there are many more responsibilities in owning a dog. Gone are the days when simply feeding and walking your dog were acceptable. They are living animals, and we must give them all we can to ensure that they are healthy and happy.
One way to get over the things in our lives that we are afraid of, or to get better at things we don’t do well, is to just do them more often. If I pray continually, theoretically, my prayers will get better (more effective) and I will get more comfortable. So, I’m going to do that today. When I was a brand new Christian a young woman told me one way to pray is “up, down, in, out,” that is, praise God, confess your sin, pray for yourself, pray for others. I know there are other devices that people use to pray (one that comes to mind is ACTS–adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication), but I’m going to use this device, for no particular reason.

David, in this much beloved psalm, describes it as walking in a valley of DEEP DARKNESS. He’s right. This grief, this loss we feel is very much like that ‑ and you wonder if that valley will ever end, if you will ever see a mountaintop again, if the numbing ache in your soul will ever ease…

Work exactly as given for other ear.
I remember starting out with the Second Coming and being struck by the gnosis of the following lines: “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold/The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere/The ceremony of innocence is drowned/The best lack all conviction, while the worst/Are full of passionate intensity”. By the time Second Coming was penned, in 1919, Yeats was no longer the perfervid young man who would intractably recite aloud, without suspiring, his favourite verses in public places and gormandize on the romantics such as Percy Bysshe Shelley, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Lord Alfred Tennyson. Yeats had, by then, discarded the beautifully rarefied evocative tone of his earlier works for an obdurate sonority confronting reality and its imperfections. This was an altogether different Yeats from the one I would learn about later when reading his early works.William Butler Yeats was not a poet by nature – acutely short-sighted, purportedly dyslexic and severely tone-deaf, he showed a propensity for science rather than language, leaving school with “small Latin and less Greek”. He was, however, “egregiously the poet,” in temperament and in appearance, muttering “ends of verse to himself with a wild eye” sporting “seedy black clothes” and “a large black bow at the root of his long naked throat”. It is now almost impossible, for me at least, to think of Yeats in any other element, but his work remains the biggest testament to his role as one of the greatest arch-bards of the 20th century. Revered by everyone from W.H. Auden to Ezra Pound, Yeats began his craft with light but deeply heartfelt odes to Maud Gonne – a distant cousin he had fallen in love with – likening her to a “rose in the deeps of his heart”, and later celebrating her beauty on a Homeric scale. Much of his early work is characterised by the paludal lows of unrequited love resonating in lines such as, “Pale brows, still hands and dim hair/I had a beautiful friend/And dreamed that the old despair/Would end in love in the end”.
I was going to save my reflection on this experience for the final day, but my brain has been bubbling over with ideas, and I didn't want to wait and risk losing a single one.

He heard the Thought Police's heavy feet on the stairs, coming for him.
Choosing the herbal tea was a big deal, particularly as we were in Starbucks. Many people know that I do enjoy a hazelnut latte. Until recently my idea of moderation was to have skimmed milk to counteract the syrup. Mmmmm! But the herbal tea was fantastic, and the mug was so big that I had a chance to really enjoy their logo. My curiosity had previously led me to do some research into the origins of the strange crowned woman, who seems to be holding 2 fishes by the tail.
McCrum convincingly makes the case that Wodehouse ought to be considered as much an American author as a British one. Toward the end of his life—well, twenty years before his death in 1975, but when a fellow lives til the age of 93, his last couple decades can arguably, I think, be called “toward the end of his life”—realizing he’d likely not ever return to England, Wodehouse became an American citizen. This prompted the comment by the New Yorker’s Frank Sullivan that the United States’ acquisition of Wodehouse “makes up for our loss of T. S. Eliot and Henry James combined.” But the humorist’s identification with America began long before; he first visited New York City in 1904 and fell in love. He spent many years working off and on in musical theater, writing for and alongside such icons as Jerome Kern, Guy Bolton, Cole Porter, and the Gershwins (Ira Gershwin considered Wodehouse a mentor). Twice he moved with his wife to California to work in the burgeoning film industry. Not only did a number of his stories and novels take place in the States, they were hugely popular among the reading public.

Our favorite game was to tell boys we liked generally accepted really uncool things. “I love KISS” was a fav. see how they react, “Oh I really like them too” yeah right loser. Why don’t you tell me about your band again, we would think. One of these was “Oh I love Blondie” because I grew-up skipping rope and singing, “Rapture” and child-hood things are to be put away in adolescence. It was really bff’s idea to like Blondie, or pretend we did, and then we let ourselves really enter that space, to have some freedom there and yes, we do honestly, in no hipster way, love it. So I started listening to disco in an unashamed way. Okay you may say she is punk, but okay she pierced that membrane, which is awesome. I was listening to this song a great deal then. It brings me comfort now.

In a large skillet melt ghee or more butter. Dice an onion into small pieces and add to butter. Chop garlic and add it to the onions. Chop chili peppers and add them. I like to add my spices at this time to toast them and make them more flavorful before adding liquids. So add the cumin, oregano, red chili flakes, sea salt and pepper. At this point the onions should start to be soft and brown bits may be accumulating on the bottom of the skillet. Open tomatoes and add them. When the tomatoes start to come to a boil, take a ladle and ladle some of the tomato-onion mixture into the cheese sauce to temper it. Stir it into the cheese and add a few more ladles of tomatoes. Then pour all of the cheese sauce into the tomato sauce. Add diced chicken and cook until warmed through. Serve with fresh guacamole and organic sour cream.
It was one of those miscellaneous evenings where you found yourself meandering back from K-nags. I have a strong feeling that it wasn’t an infamous Tuesday Dinner which drove us from the confines of our red brick haven. Nor was it a sudden realization that the first of the month was stealing past us and the Gelato Place was happily doling out scoops of an absurd flavour for a ridiculously cheap price. I vaguely remember being addicted to cranberry juice that summer. And an hour before being helplessly locked inside Rez for the night, a quick trip to Malka Ganj happened to be my only hope.

The cliff-hangers and plot twists towards the end of the book and the whole crux of the Plague incident had me with my eyes glued to the pages for the last few chapters. What exactly is going on with Godspeed and what is its ultimate mission? I loved how there were plenty of mysteries to be solved-- not just with who the killer was, but basically with the entire ship and its mission. Pieces of the puzzle only came together slowly, which was a *little* frustrating, but it totally kept me on the edge of my seat.

Thankfully, that wasn't the most exciting part of my weekend. Yesterday, we had Thanksgiving with all my family at my Mom and Dad's house. It was wonderful! I do believe my Mama may be the best cook in the world. Her dressing is out of this world! Hubs and I had leftovers for lunch and it was just as good today as it was yesterday.

What the heck – I was there, at my first London con in years. Well, that is after I found it – for those new to the ExCeL convention centre, it is vast, with a main concourse running the length of the building, housing an extended food court. There were four conventions going on at the same time (including the "2012 Zumba Instructors Convention”) and no obvious signage or information booth pointing out where the comics one was. Luckily I ran into David Lloyd on the phone and, with a brief come-see-me-at-my-table, he waved me towards the entrance.
Good morning readers! I hope this finds you doing well.

the Brussels-based European anti-poverty network (EAPN), founded in 1990, recently launched a campaign in favour of minimum income. On the website of their initiative there is support from people such as the Danish president of the European socialists group Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, and the French vice-president of the committee of the regions (CoR, a European institution), Michel Delebarre. Members of the greens have also rallied in favour of the initiative. Échos d’euro-écolos (‘Echoes from European ecology party members’) is one blog run by two young MEPs of the party, Karima Delli and Pascal Canfin, defends not just a minimum, but also a maximum income.

So I have been wanting to do this for some time now. Remember all those years ago, around Christmas time, when we would rent our stamps for free if you donated a canned good. We collected hundreds of pounds of food each year which was donated to Outreach for Hunger. It felt so good to give back to the community.
It shows that Occupy provides a much needed setting for adventure. It also shows how Occupy has created a network of places for people to freely move in to, meet people, discuss the world, share the food, and, hopefully, offer to help prepare it too. This practical, welcoming, quality of occupy where a willingness to help pays out in comradely dividend is also addressed by the New Yorker in an article describing Ray Kachel’s move from unemployment in Seattle to the adventures of Occupy Wall Street. More than anything else the article stresses the open sociality of Occupy as one of its strongest assets:
OK, But I have already prayed and asked…. I am now in panic mode, and I change my requirements from Christian Male Volunteers to Christian Male Medics that will be paid, and eventually to any Male Medic who is prepared to work for money. This will be financial ruin, but I no longer care.

Interspersed with the considerable drama are moments of hilarity and believable teenage interaction. Shigure is frequently hilarious and sarcastic (especially when tormenting his editor), but Yuki, despite a deep sweetness for Tohru, can be equally cutting. Hatsuharu's method for proving his white-on-black hair color is natural to the Student Council President is probably my favorite moment ever. Much of the "violence" is funnier than it is, well, violent. Some of it definitely is not.

Three weeks ago, a tractor-trailer truck with a load of locally grown tomatoes, over-turned on one of our narrow, steep and winding rural roads. Tomatoes were all over the place! Many, many boxes of the tomatoes were rescued but were deemed (by whatever authority) unsaleable, due to the accident. Many were donated to local food banks and soup kitchens. Lucky for me, I happened to be in the right place at the right time, and found myself the happy recipient of two 25 pound boxes of beautiful, large and plump Roma tomatoes. No one wanted to see these tomatoes wasted. (And no one was injured in the accident).

Could I have done things differently? Yes, of course. I considered going to see him. I could have begged and pleaded with him. I could have tried to make him stay – pick me! pick me! Should I have done things differently? I don’t know – I think not. In the end, his heart is hers, not mine – so for him it can only be the right decision, right!? (but let’s face it: that just sucks for me, so cheers!) If I had managed to make him stay, would he have stayed because he loved me? Or simply because I made him change his mind? I don’t think I could have been happy knowing in the back of my mind that I was his second choice – I’m a take-it-or-leave-it-package-deal.
And yes, it DOES sound as bad as it is. Because there is NOTHING you can do to "quick fix" it. So, we endure a three day run of horrible coughing at night, gasping breathing, sometimes vomiting (like last night ) from the shear force of coughing. A lot of times, we opt for the "go to" drug, steroids, which gives us the Incredible Hulk in pre-school form. (Envision Kevin telling you..."Mr. McGee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry"). Not a pretty sight, and truly, it doesn't even seem to work well anymore. Doesn't matter...steriods are prescription, and we're out from the last time we saw our doctor in Morgantown.

The talent at these camps was unbelievable! Upon arrival, Experts tested kids and divided them into ability groups for a week of intensive workouts. We'd all advance our skills and take this training back home. I say "we" because us adults put on Depends and limped to coaches' training. At the end of the week, we'd show off our skills with a huge performance for the entire camp.
We went out to the grocery store to get some pineapple for Walnut. While we were there somebody we don’t even know gave my kids each a dollar through one of the ladies that works there. Crazy! And I almost left my cell phone because I put it down on a case of water behind the conveyor belt, and forgot I put it there. One of our regular guys took us out. He’s about 10 years younger than me, and he is always very nice to me and the kids. I think he might be flirting with me, or trying to because, he said that I look like I am 10 years younger than I am, and he was really hurt when I mentioned that I could tell by looking at him that he drank far too much milk and not enough water. I didn’t mean it in a mean way. Drinking a lot of milk makes your face rounder. The boy who is the smallest physically of any of my kids, in bone structure, has the roundest face, because he drinks a ton of milk. Anyway, when I first said it, before I explained myself, you would have thought I took out my b-b gun and shot the poor guy in the foot. When I mentioned to Daughter #1 that I thought he might be flirting with me, she said, ‘Really?’ I said, ‘It happens all the time, only you don’t notice as well, because usually I can play, ‘Duck and cover,’ and hustle all of you off and pretend to be busy. You guys aren’t making it so easy for me this time because this guy is your friend too.”
Again...you don't know me. You have read some of my struggles but have no idea about the state of my mental health, which I assure you is just fine. I have encountered a LOT of heartache in life and have learned to cope and lean hard on the Great Comforter. The baby's mother knows my entire history and I have shared my blog with her and with the worker doing my study, I am mentally and emotionally stable, and I am honest about my struggles and I deal with them instead of trying to hide them or be ashamed of the fact that I am not perfect. We all struggle, I will be honest, I thought this was a low blow. I do not have mental health issues, but shaming people who do is what leads to deaths like my mom's. She knew she'd be judged like this and so she never shared. I am a bit of a germaphobe and kind of a neat freak, but my closest friends will attest to the fact that I am NOT having the same issues my own mom had.

However, as I have generally been working on a smaller scale lately, this should not be a problem!

There is no time to find out; they must exit the stage to make room for other graduates. Quickly, my sister turns to hug my father, her enormous diploma in its cover between them. And then, to my surprise, instead of offering his usual one-handed pat on the back, my father raises both arms, almost as if opening a pair of wings. He folds them around her, pulling her close, draping her in the scarlet of his own mantle, oblivious to the leather folder poking them both in the ribs.

One of the things both Hubby and I particularly enjoy when having guests to stay at our B&B is sharing with them. It is a wonder how much common ground can be found in the process of getting to know each other. We, who have essentially been strangers heretofore, suddenly find that we have similar concerns, likes and dislikes. And thus, in human terms, the world shrinks even smaller.

The education Maria Theresa provided for her children was based on learning by repetition. While this method is tolorable for some children, for Joseph it was insufferable. He had a rather short attention span which did not help. His mother often tried to please him, praise him and develop his talents. Personality wise, the boy grew up very confident in his own thoughts and ideas, and has been described as an egotist. Maria Theresa found it very difficult to get along with her son who shared her own self-willed and stubbornness.

It was at my friend Laurel's house, and we were all worn out from dancing to Aqua's Aquarium, so we decided to channel surf.

In Britten's dream that night, Hannah is back from Portland, and he talks to her about the estimate -- and about his fear that she wants to leave him.

She doesn't want to forget Rex, though, and being with Britten helps her to remember him.

Driving under the influence of intoxicating substances is the Number 1 killer on our roads and JPSA has recently put a comprehensive proposal to a number of stakeholders to tackle this scourge effectively. People need to come to the realisation that driving under the influence of intoxicating substances has dire consequences and cannot and will not be tolerated any longer. However, this problem must be effectively tackled before people are killed and/or injured as prevention is better than cure – always!
In the year 400 Prudentius wrote a poem and titled it "Psychomachia," combining the Greek words for spirit and battle. The poem describes the battle waged by Darkness and Light, Good and Evil, for the human soul. This became one of the early truths about the human condition, and in medieval times it became the basic plot for the cycle and morality plays sponsored by the Catholic Church to bring the Word of God to an illiterate public.
The Shout Out Louds have a special place in my heart. Not only was their debut album, Howl Howl Gaff Gaff, on constant repeat during the summer of 2005, but when I saw them in person in July 2008 at the Brooklyn venue Warsaw, it was and still is the best concert I’ve been to in person.

Oh, and one last thing: that word-- aspiring? It's bullshit. You either are a writer or you're not. Which are you? Actually, part of me hated it, because she's dead right, and I saw my failures writ large there. Who the fuck am I to call myself a writer when I only do it when I "feel like it?" When things get rough I open another document or window, to the point that my boyfriend was horrified at how slow my computer was moving. "You should only have five Word documents open at a time. Macs don't like Word." Mine must despise me because a typical day means 12 open Word documents, about 20 open Firefox tabs and 5-10, sometimes more, in Safari.

What can I say about these shoes? Its final, I've fallen deep. I know these shoes were launched a while back from the Balenciaga Spring/Summer collection of 2008. But if the shoe fits why not? I've been trying to find a pair of ridiculously high heels and these were the closest I can find, plus cheap! Mind you I have been eye-ing on those Litas by none other than Jeffery Campbell, but my wallet can't expand that big. However, Miss Vee created a small online business with her mum selling dupes of designer shoes. And luckily I've paired up with her blog so that you too can get your own pair of Shoes by Sara vee. Just watch out for any codes on my blog.
To address these very harsh artifacts in Mother, I did a spectral of this section. It wasn't intended to transform the really bad sections to perfection since obviously most of the artifacts in this section are well beyond recovering what was once underneath them. A few were removed successfully, some were removed leaving a mild artifact, and some were removed leaving a significant artifact, but smooth, not the previous ear damaging one. So now from 20:49-21:25 (36s) of Mother doesn't make you want to cover your ears or run for your head unit. Check out the raw 24bit/96kHz version if you want to know what it sounded like.
If you give a child blocks with letters on them, the child has infinite possibilities. When you teach them to spell, their possibilities are suddenly limited, restricted. This is how I feel about Heidi "knowing her numbers and colors." Right now, she has endless possibility in her life. She has the rest of her life to conform to the rules society imposes on her and know the things she's "supposed to know." I will not limit her potential (yet) with these finite rules.

Each weekend during November and December, the wagoner oklahoma history is home to the BCS National Championship Game. Should Alabama beat Florida and Oklahoma beat Missouri, as most pundits think will happen, then Florida would meet Oklahoma in a 65-foot taxi boat at either Regatta Park to the oklahoma history day of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry. The program educates children about agriculture and nutrition and can include field trips to local farms. Not only does the oklahoma history topics about health and nutrition, it's also good for people working in Integris Health Care and Baptist Memorial Hospital. You can enjoy fishing or dipping in the cushing oklahoma history by forests and wildlife sanctuaries. Whether one is searching for a state like Oklahoma, information on criminal records is spread over several distinct databases and government agencies. Finding a criminal record may thus require considerable patience, effort and time again that the oklahoma history topics by MAPS for kids was partly responsible for the ardmore oklahoma history of their people.
"Now think of magnifying your union with us. We, the Great Council of the Grandmothers, are with you now, and all those who work with the Net of Light are also with you. There are thousands, even millions now connected in light," they said. "Along with this union, call forth the power of the sacred places on earth. These will amplify the potency of our joint effort. Then call on the sacred beings that have come to prevent the catastrophe that threatens to overwhelm your planet. We will work together," they said, nodding slowly.

When I came up with this wacky idea, I never dreamed that everyone would be so incredibly enthusiastic and creative and wonderful! You have all done such an amazing job, and every time I think you can't be any more awesome, you are! So thank you to everyone who is hosting and posting Phyllis, and to everyone who is reading and commenting and lending their support in other ways. This tour is only what it is because of you!
This is a by-product of the ‘science fictionization’ of zombies, primarily. If we want to stick with necromancers chanting foul rituals to raise hordes of the undead, I have no problem with the concept whatsoever. By dint of involving magic, you are consciously waving away any and all of the concerns I voice below. However, science fiction, as the first word indicates, needs to pay a certain homage to science as we understand it. It can bend and stretch the rules of physiology just so far before an idea ceases to be plausible and, therefore, becomes ridiculous. The science fiction zombie is one such entity.

The final blow to Jacob’s disastrous return to the west occurred when Mrs. Jones died from cholera. Since the Wheelers’ wagons had been traveling with the Jones’ wagon at the back of the train, they had been exposed to the disease. Hoxie and the scouts forced the Wheelers and the remaining members of the Jones family (Mr. Jones and Sally Jones) to remain behind under quarantine while the main body of the wagon train carries on. Only Naomi was able to continue with the train, since she had been with her new husband. Jethro became afflicted with symptoms of cholera but recovered. Both Jacob and Thunder Heart Woman drifted into a serious quarrel, when he suggested that she take their children and attempt to find her Lakota family. Needless to say, Thunder Heart Woman took the suggestion badly and reminded Jacob that he should have listened to her warnings about the journey.

"Honkaku shochus" are not continuously distilled in column stills like grain whisky but are made in pot stills like malt whiskies. My rather shallow thought process was that, although there are very significant differences in the processes of making shochu and whisky, the Iichiko is, as a pot distilled and barley based spirit, less "foreign" than the grain whiskies the malt whisky is habitually married with.
It's as simple (and as challenging) as that.

I told my sister once that it was a real fear of mine that that would happen someday: that I’d just give up all my ideals, give up all my plans for living a life that feels truly fulfilling. That fighting would just become too much effort. She laughed at me, then gave me a hug. She doesn’t think that will ever happen.

2009. Kurdi, a good friend of Wylie, was born in Jordan and moved to Tyneside at the age of 10 with his mother, who was raised in the North East. A qualified rugby union coach, Kurdi became the owner of Newcastle Falcons Rugby Club in September, 2011, having previously bought a 40 per cent stake in the club 12 months earlier. He also has interests in land, agriculture and property as well as owning an equestrian centre at South Dissington in Northumberland. Kurdi was also the driving force in founding the Burgham Horse Festival in 2010, which has become the North East’s premier equestrian event. Kurdi will gain 25 per cent of the winnings if On His Own
It wasn’t until the end of the day or so that one of my other co-workers came running to me and exclaimed that they had finally figured out where the fish smell was coming from. I indulged – “please tell me, it’s been bothering me all day!” She began to explain that she was poking around the break room, and could smell something near the sink. She then realized that she had just poured water into her water bottle from our filtration system. And funny….the water smelled bad. So she took her cap of the bottle and gave it a good whiff. And lo and behold – the damn water smelled like fish.
HER ADDRESS IS:
In this Wall Street Journal oped Ed Morse of Citigroup points out a little appreciated fact: that oil and natural gas production is soaring in the United States—and also in our neighbors Canada and Mexico. Thanks to technological developments such as the exploitation of oil shale, the U.S. has become the fastest growing oil producer in the world and is likely to remain that way for a decade or more. Already we produce almost as much oil as Saudi Arabia; soon we will surpass it. Already we have become a net petroleum-exporting country for the first time since 1949; in the future we have the potential to export far more, or to lessen even more our already declining dependence on oil imports.
But I was still a little sad. I am so impressed with the willingness of the team to get all their tasks and jobs not only done, but done well.

By "liking" this spanking attitude, you are glorifying spanking, and if you're hitting your child so hard that you're being sent to jail for it, no matter if it's discipline or not, you SHOULD go to jail! Likely, you've hit your child so hard that you've killed it. Because that's pretty much what it takes to send someone to jail for child abuse.

Douglas Wilson likes to write books. He has authored over thirty on a variety of topics. As the pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho, he brings his experience and deft wit to bear in a satirical novel called Evangellyfish ($21.00, Canon Press) about the slow-motion collapse of the fictional Chad Lester’s Midwest megachurch. As the head pastor of Camel Creek, Lester is riding high as thousands gather every Sunday to hear him preach, others hear him via the airwaves, and his books are read by millions (often before he reads them himself.) Then Lester is accused of molesting a young male counselee and everything starts to come unglued. This is a gripping novel about sex, scandal, and hypocrisy in contemporary church culture. You will laugh, get angry, and laugh some more, but you will not be bored.

First, come up with a plan. Make sure it's one that you will be able to follow. It should challenge you, but if it is excessively difficult, you may be setting yourself up for failure. A good routine may be a full-body workout on three non-consecutive days a week. If you don't have much experience, and don't want to work with a personal trainer, it may be good to find a workout plan online or in books, to ensure that your routine is balanced and targets all important muscles.

And then handing that child to me to watch those treasures unfold. Thank you seems so small........

Sometimes (lately more often than not) I wonder about fate, whether or not it exists. By definition, it is unavoidable. Yet, I wonder if my night would have been better if I had stayed inside for one more drink, or if I hadn’t gone out at all. I wonder if, last Friday, I could have avoided her if I had left five minutes earlier or she had walked by five minutes later. I wonder if, if I had decided not to date her in December of 2009, I would be where I am now.

As my moto skills weren’t necessarily the best in the big cities, I decided to forego the first leg of the trip with the rest of the guys, which saw them travel from Tamale, through Kumasi and down to the capital of Ghana, Accra. Instead, I met them in the southern part of the Volta Region, near a city called Ho. It meant two days of long rides by myself in a part of the country I never really knew about, beyond constantly hearing how beautiful it was from people that have been (it’s the part of the country that most tourists stick to).
Does she want to have Baez removed from the case and has chosen to use Jackson as her mouth piece? It is unthinkable that he would just come up with this idea to file a bogus motion on behalf of someone he doesn’t know. He could be merely trying to get the spot light, and of course, he deserves it for the time being. The media was fooled, they printed the story and thought it was real, This blog wrote the story and went back to cross reference and discovered it was a hoax.
In the end here, respect for story as well as value is pressured ever-downward. If the writer doesn’t have respect for the product, how is the reader suppose to? Now, I’m not saying all writers are like this at all. There are plenty of great writers out there, but there is a growing population of writers out there who don’t or perhaps more difficult to deal with, the writers who aren’t experienced or knowledgeable enough to even understand how they’re feeding into this cycle. My point of all of this rambling is essentially this: have respect for your work writers and also respect for the reading experience; if you don’t believe you need/have to put out the best possible product possible, readers won’t expect it either, and they won’t value what we do as writers.

Maybe the reason was that I don't smoke or whatever, but that gave me a feel of having smoked an entire cigarette with a single puff !

This query doesn't work. There's nothing fresh or original about the plot. I have no sense of connection to the characters, and no reason to care about what happens to them. The villains are stereotypes. I'd be MUCH more interested in this if the motorcycle gang were the good guys.

Meanwhile, the international community shunned South Africa — but not Saudi Arabia, a theocracy where converts from Islam face capital punishment; or East Germany, where people who tried to leave the country were shot dead; or Kampuchea, where Pol Pot perpetrated a genocide of more than 1 million people. Only South Africa, where less than 2,000 blacks were killed by a government faced with guerrilla warfare, was subjected to UN sanctions — but not Angola, where civil war killed hundreds of thousands.

Oil has continued its consolidation in the price range of about $93 and $103 per barrel. A break above this range would be very bullish, while a break below would be bearish. Which ever way this resolves, we have a nice long base to sustain a move in either direction. There is plenty of room within some widely followed indicators for prices to move up beyond $103. Consumers won’t want to hear this, but investors will be pleased. Our favorite energy investments are high dividend paying trusts, equities or index ETFs. Collecting a growing stream of dividends takes the pain that we might feel at the pump away!

I chose to swim with my Master’s swim team. I swam three times a week (the RLRF program does include an optional 3rd day of cross-training). My practices were 60-90 minutes long: warm up, drills, speed work, tempo swims, and cool down. I feel tired, but relaxed and loose after a swim session. I’ve always thought of swimming as a massage from the inside out. The action of the body pulling itself through the water seems to work out kinks and soreness. A hot tub soak before hitting the shower doesn’t hurt, either! Swimming is my favorite low-impact, high-aerobic exercise.
The “Notice from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Forbidding Communist Party Members from Practicing Falun Gong” was an internal communication that applied to Chinese Communist Party members. There are more than a billion Chinese people, but less than a hundred million CCP members. That notice does not decree that “Chinese people” cannot practice Falun Gong. In addition, if one allowed CCP members that are also practitioners to choose between Party membership or being able to practice Falun Gong, many would choose to give up their Party membership. Of course, the CCP only allows members to join or be expelled, but not to leave voluntarily, which is consistent with its cult nature of wanting complete control over people’s thoughts and actions.

With the growing reputation and apparent irritation the party had sowed with the forces of evil, countermeasures and targets had been laid among their own number as well; as the group engaged from afar, soul eaters suddenly arrived in ambush of Cassandra–nearly slaying the sorceress where she stood save for Zantric’s quick intervention. The party set upon the soul eaters swiftly, dispatching the monstrous creatures–and then began their advance on the base, continuing their barrage of arrows and arcane might as they went.

How many of us went on to date the guy? I read online one girl is engaged to her rapist. I don’t agree with her choice but I do in some crazy way I think I know how she justified it. One of those things you hear. ‘We’ve done it already, we might as well do it again’.
You know, my question is how much talent does it take to lose $6 billion a quarter? I think there are people here today watching the Senate that would take $19 million a year to run one of these government banks to have your only record be that you lose $6 billion a quarter, that’s outrageous.
After spending a weekend in Manhattan, Haque recounts overhearing several conversations from the “movers and shakers” of the world, and ultimately exiting those situations with an air of disgust due to lack of substance and greater purpose. Having written such books as The New Capitalist Manifesto: Building a Disruptively Better Business and Betterness: Economics for Humans, Haque refers to the current cause of our recession as more of a “depression of human potential” and less an issue of macroeconomics. So how can we as marketers help turn things around?
However, it’s a bargaining point we most often concede in the end. Protestors should not hold the illusion that they will be able to go through the entire system and be released without giving names. Occasionally this happens, but generally not.
The Doppelbock is a great transitional beer to take you from Winter to early Spring. Sometimes referred to as Fastenbier (“Lenten beer”), and Starkbier (“strong beer”), the doppelbock literally translates to ‘double bock’, in case you couldn’t figure that one out on your own, Skippy. Originated in Germany (did I need to mention that, too?), it is one of the country’s strongest styles of beer, typically weighing in between 6-9% ABV – with some maxing out on the deadlift at 13%.

And just a closing thought...the perfect book can be like an abiding true love. You can be narrow minded and refuse to allow it to enter your life, but if it's meant to be, it will somehow find you and endure the test of time.
A third theoretical dimension to the right is advanced by Toni Massaro, who argues that confrontation promotes a non-functional interest: ‘to preserve the dignity of the criminal defendant.’ (T. Massaro, ‘The Dignity Value of Face-to-Face Confrontations’ (1988) 40 Florida Law Review 863, 866). Massaro reasons that the criminal trial should,
I gave a serious look at Mother of Divine Grace and St. Thomas Aquinas Academy. For all three, I reviewed the high school syllabus, since that was one of our end goals. Though the programs are similar, Kolbe repeatedly came in as the one that was the closest match to what Jon & I had envisioned for high school for our children.

The search for your passion is a combination of a natural driving force that is already within you and a conscious choice to make it happen. The problem with a lot of people in the world is at a certain point in their lives, they stop looking. Many dreams are shattered. They may be great in doing things but are never fully satisfied. In contrast, there are people facing difficult circumstances but are still incredibly content and show an ardent determination to go on. The difference between these two kinds of people is that one found what he or she is passionate about. Like breathing, filling your body with the oxygen it needs to survive, pursuing a passion keeps your spirit filled with love and the energy to be the best that you can be.

As a man who appreciates the service of His Majesty’s Navy, I have never pressed the issue much beyond this. However, at the prospect of having Mr. Tibbs in my office, I thought perhaps I might make a more diplomatic attempt to restore a certain degree of peace to my home and regain the capacity to possess a piano capable of hitting the proper notes in the proper combinations. I realize I do not play, but a man has standards one must maintain in my position, and a properly functioning insturment is one of them. Of course, I digress.

Amend your CV, cover letter and portfolio for each position. Yes, it’s a lot of effort, but it will greatly increase your chance of employment. Make sure to ask for opinions and assistance with your CV and portfolio if required. This is another thing that the placements office can assist with and the final years will be able to provide another spin on it as well. If you get rejections from placements (it’s inevitable, don’t get put off by them), be sure to ask for feedback on your application.
Well I only have about a week and a half till I get to see G! I feel like I have been walking around in a daze, with a knot in my stomach. Im not sure what the deal is, im just nervous and excited, and I feel like the days are never ending! I cry about everything. Im so sick of crying, but it feels so good at the same time. Being here with his family is great, but they all remind me so much of him that its weird at the same time. My sis in law is becoming one of my best friends. Seriously. If you dont know her, you totally should! She is fabulous! She keeps me entertained with her car dances and her funny stories of a college life that I have never known... She is amazing!
Still, I'm trying my best to fight the panic. I had been flirting with the idea of serums and other more potent products than my standard regime of moisturiser… and moisturiser. But a fling with Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate left my skin breaking out more than usual and so I gave it to a friend. Testing out samples of other serums didn’t move me either.

On the other hand, many modern people find such a position abhorrent. They would argue that the preacher’s true self can be found by stripping away the veneer of moral judgments and giving in to the impulses that it takes such effort and self-denial to suppress. If the preacher were out and proud, for example, he would be expressing who he really is. Clearly there is no agreement on the true self, which brings up what philosophers call the Socratic problem. We owe to Socrates, who lived in the age of Pericles in fifth century BCE Athens, our Western admiration for reason.

This collection of photographs was taken at Donkin Reserve, near constitution hill, in Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape. The metal artwork, by Anthony Harris and Conrad Geel, depicts a voting line in which South Africans are both literally and figuratively following in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela. It is part of the ‘Route 67 Art Journey’ which celebrates Nelson Mandela’s 67-year role in South African politics through publicly displayed artworks which trace the historical and cultural landmarks of the city. The project is currently under progress. This artwork is located directly beneath the fluttering South African flag, opposite a brick pyramid and lighthouse, and among other open-air artworks. The park is frequented by locals, tourists and dog-walkers alike; it also boast splendid views of the port below.

What influence do you think Classical Greek and Roman sources had on Nietzsche’s philosophy?
Alba Iulia is a key city for Romania. Situated at an old gold and salt commercial crossroads, Alba Iulia was a Dacian centre – the ancient Apulon, the largest city in Roman Dacia – Apulum, the capital of the Principality of Transylvania, the site of the proclamation of long-time yearned Transylvania’s union with Romania (in the 1st of Decembre 1918 – now the national day)… many Romanians consider Alba Iulia to be the spiritual capital city of their country.
So will the Direct Subsidized Loan, designed to not begin accrual until six months after a student graduates college, soon become the next Achilles heel? If Congress doesn’t act on this soon, the interest rates will double on July 1. Yeah, that deadline’s quickly approaching. I guess we all need to head over to Twitter with our hashtags.
I love, love, LOVE thick, voluminous, long lashes! I think they top off any makeup look you’re going for and they enhance our femininity as women. Whether I wear a natural look during the day with just a little liquid eye-liner along my upper eyelid, or when I wear a smokey-eyed look to go out at night, the key to my makeup routine is always big lashes. To get this dramatic look I use two mascaras and my eyelash curler. I know it sounds crazy to use two mascaras, because many think it’s already enough work just using one! But if you’re going for a luscious lash look, it’s cheaper than buying fake lashes over and over or using expensive mascara brands like the celebs use.
Ok, lately we’ve spent our early mornings (5 AM -9 AM) glued to the Tour de France. Deal with it. Usually we just watch the last 10 days or so because they’re in the high mountains and that’s where the real make or break riding happens. But this year we thought, what the heck, we’ll watch it all, and we’ll even put together a fantasy team.
This afternoon has been spent like yesterdays - watching the rugby, drinking tea and finishing off a crochet make or two.

When you hear rap groups “singing” about pimps and ho’s, and hear young black men refer to themselves with the “N” word (sorry, I am too old to feel comfortable with that word), you are hearing the glorification of their devalued status, a reaction formation. The adolescent whose parents expect him to be a failure will, most of the time, glorify his failures; this is based on the unconscious identification with the devalued aspects of the parent which have formed part of the core of the person’s self concept. These people should be shamed, not glorified.

Paulina booked to the Strasburg prom to check out a couple of the cousins in their dresses. We did try on the dress again today with the new undergarment. I was much better. We now have dress, underclothing, jewelry, makeup, hairdresser in place, nails ready to attach, but still working on shoes. I don’t see any glass slippers appearing, so I guess we will have to find something in some corner of the world.

Last Sunday, we took him to the park to ride his bike. While we were there, he saw some people playing tennis. He announced that he wanted to learn to play. "We don't have any racquets, Dylan!" "Well, let's go home and get them, and then come back!" "Uh... no". I figured he would forget about it by the next day. Nope. It was the first thing out of his mouth Monday morning. He kept at it until I finally succumbed Monday afternoon. We played for an hour, until I finally had to make him stop! I was exhausted. Not Dylan, though. He could have kept playing for another hour.
My friend Kristin called the other day to schedule a dinner and mentioned that she is running the All-Star 5K for the All-Star game coming up in a week or so. She told me I should run it with her and what does my dumb self do? I signed up. Keep in mind that I only started running again this week and am only up to about a mile without stopping. I'm really only in it for the t-shirt. Oh, and to top it all off, I'm going to go see Kathy Griffin the night before. I love that broad. And, yep, I'm a glutton for punishment.
I'm a big fan of continuity myself. I know that nothing stays the same for very long in this life but, lately, change has seemed to become a religion in certain quarters. Often it is change for changes sake - or, as we used to call it, FIDGETING!

I've used this sweet bunny, Flopsey, from the new Two Scoops for Flopsey stamp set. He sure makes me long for summer and two scoops of some yummy Gelato! I thought I would use these pretty MME 6x6 Follow Your Heart, Be Happy papers that make me think of a warm summer breeze and a cool treat! I colourd Flopsey with my Copics and cut him out and pop-dotted him up on the panel cut with the new gorgeous Designer Labels 1 STAX Die-namics. As I said yesterday, I can't get enough of the new Mini Scallop Edge Die-namics and so I used it again on my Flopsey card. I cut some Twill tape with the larger of the 2 ribbon Die-namics from the First Place Award Ribbon Die-namics and tucked the little twill flags under my flowers. I stamped one of the cute sentiments from this set on the smaller ribbon die. I sprinkled around some pink half pearls and added some Honeydew Twinery Twine from MFT.

That’s about as close as I get to a beer ‘review’ and it’s always hard enough to hide your own biases let alone explain to someone how the beer feels and such. I still reckon that the best beer is the one in your hand and is second only to one that a mate bought for you so why not treat yourself, support the guys who are having a crack at brewing decent beers and, while you’re at it, support the retailers who are giving the good stuff some real shelf space and talk to the blokes in the shop about what you like and be led by their recommendations.

Err, right, so, Stephen Baldwin’s dad miraculously manages to get himself eaten by a Great White Shark whilst pottering about in a Venetian canal, but no one knows that, everyone thinks he’s just mysteriously disappeared, the eponymous sharks in the eponymous Venice are, I can only imagine, the big surprise revelation later on. Stephen Baldwin, like any good son, sets about investigating the mysterious disappearance and within approximately five seconds spots a massive fin merrily wending its way through the serene waterways of Venice.

More on what that ulterior motive was in a second, let's talk about Alex's first night in his new apartment. The sexually frustrated painter–oh, didn't I mention that he's a sexually frustrated painter? well, he is (on top of painting, not having sex, and going to school, he also works at a video store)–lies in his bed listening to the sound of Nicole moaning with pleasure as a result of whatever that heavy metal dude she brought up to her apartment was doing to her (the whole sequence is seen through Alex's eyes, so we don't exactly see what this guy is actually doing to make her moan like that). At any rate, the last thing we hear is the sound of Nicole's gentlemen caller screaming. Interesting.

I'm happy for them and of course wouldn't wish this upon anyone, but it highlight the enormous loss and longing I feel for my own daughter, who should also be here with me - but isn't. I know I am a mother, an quite an amazing one. I've been challenged more than any other type of mother has. Endured and loved in a way not many others do. Yet the world doesn't see this, I am not seen as a mother just because my baby is not here...This beautiful blog entry captures exactly how I feel today.

“Do you now, or have you ever used illegible performance reports?”
Oh… and maybe it’s a personal objection, but I feel like the relationship between Jack and Rose could have existed just as easily without the existence of Billy Zane at all. They could have given her some other hoity-toity rich girl issue that Jack breaks down, but instead they just make her a girl who cheats on her fiancé (odious as he may be), and that seems unnecessary and unseemly.
I pause and let the feeling of fear overtake me. I think, "What if I write like a crazy person and it sucks? I have to think about what I'm doing. I have to remember everything I've learned and apply it as I'm writing."
Anyway, at least I have avoided the confusion caused by Louise Rennison where, in one of her fabulous Georgia Nicholson books, she refers to ‘a chav lighting up a fag.’ No…don't worry Americans...not that kind of fag!**

Only infantry squads get armor saves. The roll is made every time a squad takes casualties from a weapon line shot at them, as many times per turn as needed. This means that a unit targeted by another one, shot with 3 different weapon lines, will roll armor saves 3 times, and not just one after all the casualties have been added.
Brian and I enjoyed looking through them together and got started on laundry right away. : ) I'm really not sure how they got to us...One bag had a tag that said it went through Chicago and another through LAX. I don't know how they arrived, but I do know that the Lord had His hands in the details. Both Brian and I had come to terms with the fact that our suitcases and everything in them were probably lost forever. I laid awake for a few nights worrying about them, but as I was agonizing over where they were and what we could do to get them back, the Lord brought a thought to me. I had lost suitcases. I left them at an airport and filled out the forms to get them back. They had things in them that were precious to me, but nothing that I couldn't live without. This loss I was feeling was just a tiny glimpse into the feelings that my precious little girl's birth mommy feels every single day, hoping and praying that her daughter was found and taken to a safe place. That someone is helping her and loving her and caring for her.
There is no such thing as objective reality. Two cannot be proven. Nothing can be shown to exist. Time and space, love and hate, good and evil, cause and effect, are all just ideas. Anyone who says they know anything is really saying they don’t know the only thing. The greatest religious and philosophical thoughts and ideas in the history of man contain no more truth than the bleating of sheep. The greatest books are no more authoritative than the greatest luncheon meats.

I recently went to an area in Cape Town’s CBD called Bo-Kaap. It is a very old neighbourhood in the centre of the city. What makes this place so special is that it’s residents (who are mostly Coloured people with a Malaysian or Muslim background) paint their houses in the brightest, most vibrant colours, and because of their heritage, as you walk through the neighbourhood, you can smell the most sensational and fragrant curry smells. It’s a sensory delight walking through there, hearing the children play in the streets, smelling the delicious foods, seeing these brilliant colours and feeling the warm ocean breeze on your face. I took some photographs, which is actually the main reason I went there, but I would like to go again, but much later in the day, when the sunlight isn’t so very harsh.

Why she waited 15 minutes later to order our food was questionable, but why she wrote it on her personal electric bill was even more questionable.

I. The Throne’s Possessor
Last night my husband temporarily lost his wedding ring (and by “lost” I mean he took it off to shower and shave and sat it down on the shelf, in plain sight, with my facial cleansers). Neither of us could find it for a few hours and in those few hours I realized, once again, how much I love that man. To him it wasn’t that he lost a ring it was that he lost his wedding ring and it was important to him. He kept stressing to me, “You know I didn’t just take it off, right? I know I had it on. I had it on before I got in the shower. I know I did. Where could it be?” While we both scoured the apartment looking for it I couldn’t help but smile. Of course I wasn’t mad that he had lost it. I take mine off before I shower too and I also take mine off before I go to sleep at night so how could I possibly be upset with him? Instead, I was happy because I could see how important his ring is to him and how important that small symbol of our love and commitment is to him. He also kept saying, “If we can’t find it I will get another one. I want my wedding ring.”
We played together from there on out.
The ratio of salt to water might vary depending on how much water it will take to cover the poultry. That is why there is a differential in amounts. Whole chickens will require more than cut-up or quarter pieces and a turkey might require doubling the recipe.
When I write my great dog training manifesto and become the next famous dog trainer, I will have to use this book’s layout as a model. Especially because I was amused at how many of her tips also pertain to dogs.
And my take on the sketch. Photos are from my son. Him and his varsity friend Brad did a road trip round SA last year and when they were in Cape Town managed to get in a game of golf and he sent me stunning photos of their holiday and I couldn't resist using these one.

Starting to think about my next cruise already and it's about a year away. G and I want to go on a cruise next year for our 10 year anniversary. (We are celebrating 9 years this week). I want Robyn and Lightning to come with us too as May is their anniversary month too. I absolutely love cruise vacations. : )
Revelation 22:15
By 1901 Britain imported 16,000 tons of rags, 194,000 tons of esparto and 448, 000 tons of wood pulp. The cheapest papers, for the mass-market, took the least trouble to de-acidify their products. They were ephemeral by design.
In yesterday's post I wrote about how GDA surprised me at work (shocked the heck out of me, really!) with flowers and a balloon, and when I got to his home for a romantic dinner for two, there were more flowers and a big heart-shaped box of chocolates waiting for me on the kitchen table. The flowers were Gerbera daisies (daisies and tulips are my favorite flowers!)... the chocolates were Russell Stover.
Behind the Tivoli theater there is a car park and on the walls there is some fantastic Graffiti It is no accident that the college of art and design is across the road.

Unfortunately, this was not the case since “House of Walker” was situated in a large, empty studio in the Cooper Design Space instead of the appropriately named Majestic Halls. Intricate arcs, balconies, and tiles were all replaced by dull pipes and cement walls. However, some pop art of Johnnie Walker whisky bottles and historical trivia fixated to the walls did liven up the place. Furthermore, where “House of Walker” lacked in interior design, they made up for it with their spectacular view of Downtown LA. In contrast to “Raise the Macallan,” couches were also provided in this Johnnie Walker event. They also made sure guests had enough food and drinks to leave satisfied.
The alternative, that my tastes have just shifted/settled on a style unlike the style I wrote Heaven Can Wait in, provokes a different question. Specifically, the question of how far I want my published oeuvre to reflect my tastes. Arguably, it's a question of integrity, but I'm not sure it's a serious one. There is still the issue that the later parts of the trilogy are written in style much closer to my current preference, and so if I leave book 1 as it is there's going to be a bit of a clash (particularly if, as discussed last time out, I decide to bung the three together in one volume).
All of my family and friends have been really cute and giddy over it. They have been bragging and showing everyone which in turn makes this little lady feel VERY loved.
I had been thinking for some time how to express this and eventually come up with the Cornflake Test. More precisely, "Do Polish people eat cornflakes or other (breakfast) cereals, if so when and how?".
I sail out of the Sailingest Club in the South: Davis Island YC
It was an interesting and varied discussion covering subjects such as biomimicry for solving technological challenges, new uses for bacteria, gender-based violence in Africa, creative destruction of industries through disruptive innovation, how to prevent desertification, how the perception has changed on disability, sustainability in transportation and food distribution. I think that the organizers had done an excellent job in creating an innovative atmosphere and the schedule was set with a number of coffee breaks for group discussion and debriefing of the covered topics.

A long, long time ago, in a galaxy that now seems far away, before we had ever even heard of unschooling, our parenting practices were pretty far out of the mainstream. Cloth diapers, washed at home?

After that I apologized to Julia I apologized to the rest of the ex files.

New Jersey – Twelve Sharp by Janet Evanovich
This is the time of year I enjoy having a nice, hot bowl of soup on occasion, like when the temp dips. I've said before that I like to have something chicken-or-another around as I think it makes you feel better in cold weather, soothes a tickling throat and just helps in warming you up all over when your body and mind is aching from winter blues.
Some interesting asides emerge from the reports of the day. Firstly, no worries by the Football Association about competition from the League programme. Without the presence of television cameras, they were sure that their offering was a ‘superior’ product and had no qualms about a full fixture list taking place that afternoon.

Dr. Cloward's paper for the Socialist Scholars opened with a call for a systematic strategy of "irregular and disruptive tactics" among the poor, urging them to overburden city and state governments with their "demand,," as a means of forcing these governments to turn to the federal government for more and more funds.
Andrea Calvert had to run away. She couldn't stay on the farm with her foster parents, shaming them before their neighbours and legalistic church. She couldn't face going to live with strangers in her condition, as her foster mother had arranged. But she couldn't face being pregnant and alone. She would have to take care of this in her own way. But when Andrea arrives at Evie's Rocky Road Diner, she sees an opportunity for work and decides to stay. Evie's gentle advice begins to change her heart. She shows her the stone tumbler set up in the basement of the diner and gives Andrea a stone pendant, saying, "God is always doing things in our lives, but it takes time. He knows exactly when to take the pressure off or increase it. He knows just how much tumbling we need." As she struggles to make decisions that will change her life, Andrea discovers her foster mother's diary and the wrenching story that reveals the deep reasons for the dysfunction in their family. Meanwhile, a figure from Andrea's past has hired investigators to

Well, my loading days are over and I'm excited about that because now I get to see some changes. I didnt gain much on my load days which scares me but I have done pretty well today. I had tea for breakfast, chicken and celery for lunch, an apple for a snack and tomatoes and steak (lean) for dinner and I'm saving my apple for later when Im doing homework (thats when I get bored and want to eat). When I finish my apple tonight I will be at 490 cal for today. I was hungry but not in a shakey, I need to eat kind of way but in an empty kind of way. I figure that will go away when my stomach shrinks from 500 cal a day diet.
Does this allow him the right to be on television – providing insight to kids and parents that cannot think for themselves? Generations of hockey fans in this city, take these guys’ words as the only words when it comes to intelligence in hockey. Because of these ‘ broadcasters’, blue and white collar francophones live in the dark ages. It is a type of propaganda. A dictatorship. A sovereign legacy …
One other thing that struck me about Whitby was the distinct lack of chain stores. Other than a Co-op supermarket, nearly every shop, café and restaurant there was a small independent business. And that is so rare these days.

The last one to talk about was the Brooklyn Black Ops which I had with my wife this weekend. Wow. That was awesome. It was young as we just picked it up last week. We already had one that we are aging and we decided to open this bad boy up to see how it was now. Oh my was my initial thought. The bourbon barrel aging on the stout was very noticeable and added good flavor to it. The stout (which is just the Brooklyn Black Chocolate stout they normally sell) was aged in the barrels for fourth months. This toned down the normal burn on the BCS and made it really drinkable already. With aging, this is going to incredible. Lots of chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla flavors were found in this beer. I loved it and will put this in my exclusive 5 category.
Words fail; one must use words and then extrapolate from them, attempt to use them to transcend themselves. ‘Love’ is a word that stands for an idea, a concept, which in this context is inadequate to the extreme. In the culture by which these mind/bodies are conditioned, love is held up as the highest value. But we seldom examine what we mean by it. Like most of our thoughts and values, it is surrounded, protected by fuzzy thinking to avoid the clarity which leads to self-examination which can lead to awakening, to seeing through the mist of this world which has been pulled over our eyes to blind us to the Truth.
I know I’m not particularly attractive, and I’ve got lots of friends who are not particularly attractive either, but their looks have never crossed my mind, and I’ve never avoided someone based purely on their appearance.
Death does not exist in a timeless, spaceless world. In the end, even Einstein admitted, “Now Besso” (an old friend) “has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us…know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.” Immortality doesn’t mean a perpetual existence in time without end, but rather resides outside of time altogether.
What we do seem to have is a bumper crop of bishops and priests who want to be prophets, but do not want to be bishops and priests (except that it helps them to be prophetic). We have clergy and laity who love to tinker with the liturgy, but are woefully or willfully ignorant of Scripture, Patristics, and the Anglican Reformers… the very wellsprings and sources of our Faith and Tradition. We have hundreds of parishes with interfaith services and not a few with the actual prayer services to other deities or from other faith traditions, but precious few that offer the daily offices on a daily basis.
We need his strength to teach us to be content in every condition. The apostle had seemed to boast of himself, and of his own strength: I know how to be abased (Phil. 4:12); but here he transfers all the praise to Christ. “What do I talk of knowing how to be abased, and how to abound? It is only through Christ who strengthens me that I can do it, not in my own strength.”

Now, Anna has a new one-mom, one-daughter project, and it seeks to benefit the growing number of people in our area who need food assistance in these tough economic times. She started out by leaving letters at the homes of people in and around Clayton, asking them if they have trees bearing ripe fruit that they can spare. In her letter, Anna says “I often drive past your house on my way to Grandma’s and notice your fruit trees are filled with a healthy crop. I am wondering if you will be harvesting all the fruit for your own family. Or would you be so kind to pick a few bags for me to deliver to local food pantries. They appreciate fruit donations."
When the butter is melted, remove it from the oven, and brush it onto both sides of a triangle of bread. Don’t be shy: apply the butter generously, so no spot is left uncoated. The bread should feel a little heavy in your hand. Dip the bread into the cinnamon sugar, taking care to coat both sides. Lay it on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pieces of bread.
I remember stressing about the keyboard setup that day. I even printed out a manual that wasn’t very helpful partially because I was panicking. Nevertheless, I managed to set up the patch that I was happy with eventually.
Sherri Shepherd – told the gut wrenching story of a mother who is helplessly watching her newborn suffer. It’s very sad, and she choked me up a few times. She really is just a massive fan of the show, and a proud mother. That’s a winning combination. If Kate Gosselin had a shred of personality, she’d still be famous, and she mightve won DWTS despite her dancing. Sherri Shepherd also happens to be a confident performer and has nailed her dances 3 weeks in a row.

I learned in Carol’s book that if you expose ducklings to water when they are two or three days old, it will activate their oil gland, helping them waterproof themselves so that they can go out and forage in damp grass earlier without getting water-logged. Otherwise, the oil gland doesn’t activate until they are about 8 weeks old. I gave them each a warm (70+ degree) bath/swim for a few minutes on Friday. Since they were born on Sunday or Monday, this may have been too late. But it sure was fun. They would freak out for a bit, and then float around, their little feet going as fast as they could, slowly coming to understand “hey, wait a minute…I’m a duck…this feels pretty good”.

I’ve lost a few pounds for sure, but I feel like I’ve lost about 20. I definitely don’t look any different than I did last week, but I feel more solid, less flabby, and stronger, more energized. I’m excited to get to the point where my clothes start to feel looser and I can actually see a difference in my shape. But on the other hand, I didn’t exactly notice when I was gaining weight. In my mind, I look no different than I did 30 lbs ago. Of course, I can see the difference if I look at pictures side by side, but in the mirror I look the same as I did in college. Maybe it’s because I look at myself every day and the change happens so gradually it’s hard to notice. Or maybe there’s some level of denial that I could let myself get this big.

On Saturday, the wind was from the SE at about 8-11 knots. With the wind direction, the starting line was set such that a boat could not cross the line on starboard, but could cross perpendicular to the line on port tack. We maneuvered toward the boat end of the line and with the time counting down, sailed starboard about halfway down the line and tacked to port, crossing the line well ahead of the other four boats in our class. Dulcinea(J105) and Carmanah(C&C 43) were off to the right of the boat end, and Tantalus(Express 37) and Blackout(Schock30/30 GP) went too far north of the line into lighter winds and could not get back to the line in time for the start.

Luckily for fans of reality television 2011 offered up a large assortment of genuinely enjoyable reality programming, unlike last year where a lot of our old favourites seemed as though they were finally packing it all in. There were some fresh faces that made for pleasing alternatives to the creakier formats but even some of our old favourites were back in form this year.

Luckily my sink just needed a new faucet, but of course I had no one to help me replace it. A reliable Murrieta plumber was just what I needed. I don't understand why I never stay on top of home repair, I really do know that some things cost more left undone. The toilet was a whole other story, my luck really ran out on that one. The toilet needed replaced along with some minor additional plumbing. I was told the year before that it only needed a new wax ring. Yet another reason not to let projects go for too long.
Just a few rules:
The next step would be to convince these individuals that “sharing” power would be to the greater benefit of all concerned. That taking on the full responsibility as individuals would have been tantamount to individual failure – which is what I think may have scared them all away initially – but that by being able to focus on their strengths in tandem with others of similar ability could lead to extraordinary results for American track and field as well as for each as individuals.

Nope, it’s Pauline, the long-forgotten charlatan of the aboriginal Donkey Kong arcade games. Wouldn’t you apperceive it, Donkey Kong himself is in the crowd, eyeing the attractive brunette. And if his offers of amore are ultimately abandoned by Pauline, DK flies into yet accession rage, kidnapping the babe and demography her to the roof of the park. Now, it’s up to you to accomplishment her.

As a result, I’m going to do something crazy, something hysterical (in the best sense of the word), and I’m going to turn this blog into a feast for the senses. Alright, maybe that’s lofty goal for a 100th post. Let me aim lower, okay, here it is: I will include…Highlights from the “Read More” section (my blog posts that could use a little more love and why), a mini-reggie story, AND A LINK FOR 100 of MY FOLLOWERS.

I carried out a very unscientific poll of my own this morning while I had coffee. I asked a few people having coffee at the cafe what they thought of the Human Rights Act. Two said they didn’t know anything about it. This is quite understandable – how many people really do, apart from lawyers, politicos and activists? Two said it had to be abolished, but admitted they had never read the Act or the European Convention and one person said it was absolutely vital we keep it – but he, too, admitted that he had never read the act or the convention. Intrigued by this, I rang up two lawyer friends. They are not Human Rights lawyers (Obviously, human rights lawyers tend to know what is in the Act and the Convention). They were only able to tell me about three of the freedoms enshrined in the convention. I was rather surprised – but not totally surprised. The truth of the matter is that most people don’t know the structure of the Convention or the Act, let alone the main provisions or the detail. This is totally understandable. They have a broad ‘feel’ based on news and reading in the newspapers.

By his young adult years, Rickey had an established habit of drinking and using drugs. He was a good provider, and always worked, but hovered on the edge of a breakdown with his habits. Fast-forward to 2011; Rickey was using a drug marketed as “bath salts” and sold in gas stations and pharmacies over the counter (it has now been made illegal by a special act of the FDA), but which is actually some form of methamphetamine or mephedrone taken by snorting. He became convinced, among other things, that Apple Computer Company was conspiring against him, and that his wife was having an affair with someone she met online. One night Rickey was in a mad rage, throwing furniture around his house, and yelling at his wife, when his mother called the county sheriff. As they were arriving, he was tearing off in a pickup truck. The deputies passed him and swung around to give chase. They managed to pull him over, but all the fight was not out of him yet. Rickey ended up on the hood of the truck kicking and screaming at the deputies, who were grabbing at his legs. Rickey jumped on one of the deputies and proceeded to do pretty well pummeling him, until a third deputy arrived. One of them pulled out his service revolver and attempted to shoot. The pistol clicked repeatedly, but did not fire. The three officers eventually restrained Rickey and got him to the county jail.

These cuts did not come as a surprise to the budget planners at the university. They knew that at some point, the state was going to have to cut their budget in light of the economic climate. In the 2009-2010 fiscal year, MSU planned how they would deal with the loss of their funding. The result was a two-part increase in tuition. “We wanted to put in the staggered increase necessary to sustain our revenue and to sustain the quality of the institution,” said Brent Johnston, University Management Analyst at MSU.
Okay so, V-day. Today you are nothing more than a holiday where I can see other people getting flowers at work, sharing chocolates that you brought it, moving down the hallways around clusters of balloons and such.

Not hating the world on the one day when it’s supposed to be about love and such other rot.

If you really want to help me, give me yourself. Write me a letter, take me out for coffee, hold me. As long as your focus is helping through and not trying to cure me (believe me, I can feel the difference) it helps. Give me whatever you can of yourself. I’m not sure why it helps but it does. Just make me a part of life for however much time you have to share. Play some X-box with me for 2 hours. Squeeze my hand for a second. Just give me yourself, and if you aren’t comfortable with that, PLEASE don’t offer to help.

“If, on the other hand, we emphasize our glory, intelligence, grace, generosity, discrimination, honesty, capacity for love, creativity, and native genius, those qualities will be made manifest in our behavior and in our works.

According to Wikipedia, it is said that the word "Torah" is derived from "Yara" which then came to mean "to lead" or "guide". It can also mean "to teach". Marvin said to me that Yara is traditionally a female name but in this case the name was picked because it can also mean "guide" or "lead". At the breeder that Yara came from the dogs are given names starting from A and ending in Z.

In order to put up content you need to have finished pieces, then have good photos, then resize the photos for the web, write copy, create the component pages for a category or gallery, arrange everything in the back end of the site, then press publish and hope for no broken links or mistakes.

Christ refers only once in the gospel to His own heart, and then it is this picture that we see: “I am meek and lowly in heart.” To be poor in spirit is to be rich toward God, while pride of heart is spiritual poverty.
Asylum getters have their houses fitted out with every thing they need. There is a free car because its cheaper than paying for taxis for them. Indigenous people are advised to use public transport, but not asylum seekers.
Another technique I’ve been using a lot more lately is to draw out what’s going on in the code. For one of my recent programming assignments, I had to write a bunch of methods for a list class, and every time, I would end up with AT LEAST two NullPointerExceptions somewhere in the body. I just got fed up, and spent 15 minutes just drawing and thinking out one of the methods, and turns out, that was the only one that compiled in one shot and threw no exceptions.
That’s how I came to believe that I would get something akin to braces. At least that’s the first thought that popped into my mind, probably because I’ve always been somewhat self-conscious about my not-so-straight teeth. At last! This clever lady dentist has guessed my secret dream of a Hollywood smile and she’s going to make it come true! I went home and told Mr. Baddie all about it.
Aah . . . that’s better!

Vic Muniz, exactly opposite, gives something back, eh? He steps out of the gallery in order to step right back in, united with other people, people who would otherwise never make it in there. Not in a million years. The guy is a mensch. He remembers where he came from, he respects his roots, he returns to give something back. Yet he ends up taking as much as he gives. He employs, he enlightens, he empowers and he also eliminates some economic poverty. But damn if those dump-diggers don't raise his consciousness too and enable him to make art he could never make on his own. Not in a million years.
I took a screenshot of the recipes bookmarked on my computer yesterday and this is what it looks like: there are about 55 recipes in here, and I'm dying to try each one. More are being added to this list on a daily basis, I might add.
For example, I target a lot of auto repair shops. I’ve found that Monday mornings are the worst since most people are dropping their cars off for service as well as most afternoons (after 3pm) since the mechanics are scrambling to finish up cars before people pick them up. During the rest of the week, I’ve found that mid morning (10-11:30am) and after lunch (1-3pm) are the best times to reach auto repair owners.

"The Legislature created the Forensic Science Commission to ensure we have forensic evidence we can trust in our courtrooms --in order to increase public safety and the public faith in justice system," said Senator Ellis. "Unfortunately, since Mr. Bradley has taken the reins, rather than move the commission forward to look into allegations, find the truth, and repair problems in our broken justice system; the Commission has invested most of its time and energy finding ways to avoid looking into problems and looking for loopholes to block the commission from doing what it was created to do."

It all had echoes of a few years ago, little Hollie Steele, who go to the live Semi Finals, and sang Edelweiss, she got half way through and started sobbing.. The pressure got too much for her and the top man had to pay the commercial companies back as their adverts weren’t show because little Hollie wanted to sing again.
"It is a shame that anyone feels our demos and marches will not achieve much, but we are all entitled to our opinions. However yesterday's day of action - apart from the publicity engendered - was great because it gave all those who attended a sense of community and hope. To get so many together from all the closed plants is an achievement in itself. It was brilliant to see our comrades from Belfast. Some of the steering group travel around all the areas for meetins and can pass messages back and forward but that doesn't compensate for the actual 'face to face' chat, shared experiences and laughter between our members.
Another questionable call by NASCAR came with only 12 laps to go. Stewart was leading the race when a caution comes out. According the Stewart the culprit was a plastic bottle. Yep. A 16oz. water bottle NASCAR felt was a threat to the safety of the drivers on the track. Granted, Stewart’s pit crew yo-yoed all night in terms of performance and they faulted on the last caution, not allowing Stewart a shot at the win.

Lying just beneath the surface on The Last Play at Shea is the story of how the average Joe goes from nothing but a loving mother in the Bronx, makes it to Los Angeles, finds success, and then comes back to his roots in the city that made him. Anyone who has dreamed of going back home again can relate to this story, which is where Crowder finds success in his storytelling. This is the American dream incarnate, set inside one of the most blue-collar ballparks in the country, Shea Stadium.

As I have said on many occasions, I think it is important to know your personal style. Some lucky people can pull off a number of styles and colours, but for others you really need to know what suits you and your personality. One of my friends has it easy. She looks good in just a bright t-shirt and jeans, with a few personal touches. The simplest things, yet so effective! It can be a bit harder though, and it may take time. (13 years in my case!) But now it's all sorted, I know exactly what to look for in a shop, and what will suit me before I have to take 2 or 3 trips to the changing rooms and get my friends to get me a different colour or size! My 'personal style' is to be a different to everyone else, take the trends, and alter them to how I like them. Like when everyone was wearing harem pants, and I opted for pink flowery ones!

Both have engaging storylines, with appealing yet flawed main characters. I am enjoying both of them very much, and plan to finish them both. But, forced to choose, I must say that one of them is a bit more compelling to me, and I would be a bit more distraught if you pried it out of my fingers before I could finish. I think the difference comes down to two things.

Either way, Chuck Colson was an outstanding voice for right morals and ethics, and a defender of the Christian faith. There is a large pair of shoes left empty by his absence, and I pray that his example encourages others to step up as he did, and let their voices be heard. No soul is too small, and no previous life circumstance can hold you back.

If you are one of those people who checks out other peoples opinions on an item before buying how do you go about deciding who's opinion to check out? Again we'll use the book example. Do you just check reviews on Amazon or Goodreads or wherever else the book might be listed? Or do you have a go to blog or site that you check to see if they've read the book yet? If you have a blogger who you read on a regular basis and they say they don't like a specific book would that change your mind about buying it?

So, next time you’re tempted to punch someone (figuratively, verbally, or physically) for messing up your stuff, I hope you’ll remember my two sons. Instead of running around figuring our clever ways to justify getting revenge, or gaining the upper hand, let’s extend our hand instead. There’s no triumph in beating down one who steals our stuff. In the end, it’s still just stuff, and people matter way more.

The papers are DCWV The Pet Stack. I love the bits of blue in all the earthy colors in this stack. I wish that DCWV did more smaller papers and brought the pattern down to scale. I used Walnut Distress Ink on all my edges. The buttons and the twine are from the candy stash that I won from Michelle O last year. I haven't really buttoned up much, but she sent a whole bunch of vintage buttons and I love the look with the colors of the DCWV papers. My ribbons are a mesh wired ribbon layered with a brown sheer, both from Berwick-Offray. A little puppy button from Jesse James adorns my sentiment and a few teeny pearls finish my other corners. My image is ... (you know what's coming) popped up on foam dots. I did use a stylus to just slightly round out my image a bit around the edges too.

Robert Malley, another influential liberal voice who had been a Middle East advisor to Bill Clinton when he was president, while more constrained than Friedman, suggests that any sustained display of Palestinian nonviolence if met with Israeli violence would be an embarrassment for Washington. Malley insists that if the Palestinians were to take to the streets in the spirit of Tahrir Square, and Israelis responded violently, as the Netanyahu government certainly, it “would put the United States in an ..acute dilemma about how to react to Israel’s reaction.” The dilemma depicted by Malley derives from Obama constant encouragement of the democratic aspirations of a people who he has repeatedly said deserve their own state on the one side and the unconditional alignment with Israel on the other. Only a confirmed liberal would call this a genuine dilemma, as any informed and objective observer would know, that the U.S. Government would readily accept, as it has repeatedly done in the past, an Israeli claim that force was needed to maintain public order. In this manner, Palestinian nonviolence would be disregarded, and the super-alliance of these two partners in crime once more reaffirmed.

Hello, friends. I am so sorry for my cyber absence lately. We had our year end recital at the dance studio where I teach on Friday, and you can't imagine the amount of work and time that went into making this weekend a success. I am so pleased to say that it really was such a success. I am so proud of all of my students, and how much they have grown as dancers and individuals this year. I felt like a proud momma bear when I watched them each take the stage on Friday. I feel so blessed to have found the best kept secret of the county where I live.

Fitness classes should build confidence, that is what we try to do!

My eyes, her eyes, dart around a storehouse, cast-iron beams under the ceiling, grey stone walls, hard cement floor underneath, a whiff of sea coming through from somewhere.
After the course is finished, I am hoping that I will be able to work at the dive shop. I’m hoping that my existing connection with the shop owner and the staff will be enough to land me some work. I haven’t recieved any promised though and my guess is that I’ll only be making around $10 an hour. So I’m on the hunt for a sitter that will work for less than that, and that won’t be easy to find. The big thing I plan to use as leverage is that there are no diapers to change since my kids are a bit older.

Look, I know a lot of Conservatives who are Ron Paul supporters. One of my best friends from high school was a Paul supporter on the Libertarian ticket in 2008. They get called Paulbots and Ronulans and Paultards. The farther right you are the more you think he wears a tinfoil hat & looks for UFO's while he listens to Coast to Coast AM on the radio at night.The guy has some decent domestic ideas but as far as foreign policy goes, the guy's basically a freakin' kook. I have friends who can't wait to get to the RNC and see all the Paul banners & flags and cry their support for Ron Paul as he sweeps the convention and steals the nomination from the guy who already bought it....and yet the only race he's won was, what, Puerto Rico and that ain't even a state. Dude, give it up.

Five minutes into the second half of the play, my daughter announces in a too-loud voice, ‘I think I will just lie back and go to sleep.’ I’m starting to feel the same way. We’re getting to some of the more difficult material – Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn have just witnessed a murder in a graveyard. Injun Joe, the perpetrator, blames the murder on a hapless local who doesn’t remember committing the crime but accepts his punishment, which is death by hanging.
Method: Covert the boiling milk to paneer/channa by adding the lime juice. More detailed explanation about homemade paneer aka Indian cheese is given in this page. Mash the channa till it is as smooth as possible. Add the sugar to it. Put this mixture into a shallow vessel stirring constantly over low heat. The mixture will first turn liquidy and then start thickening. When the mixture becomes a creamy thick paste and leaves the sides of the vessel, stir in the cardamom powder and put into the ghee-smeared plate. When cool, cut into pieces. Enjoy sandesh on this auspicious new year 2006.

The majority opinion has skirted the issue of whether or not the question of the existence or continuance of the emergency is one for the political department of the Government to determine by restricting “the life of the emergency powers of the President to the time the Legislature was prevented from holding session due to enemy action or other causes brought on by the war.” I cannot subscribe to this narrow interpretation of Commonwealth Act No. 671, for in my opinion it is contrary to both the plain language and manifest purpose of that enactment. The law invests the President with extraordinary powers in order to meet the emergency resulting from the war and it expressly says that the President is to exercise those powers “during the existence of the emergency.” The Act does not say that the President may exercise the powers only when the Legislature is not session. Much less does it say that the emergency powers shall cease as soon as the Legislature has convened in regular session. An emergency resulting from a global war cannot end with the mere meeting of the Legislature. Neither may be legislated out of existence. The Legislature, once it was convened, may, if it so desire, revoked the emergency powers of the President, but it cannot by any form of legislative action put an immediate end to the emergency itself. Well known is a fact that a deliverative body, such as the Legislature, because of the time consumed in the study and discussion of a measure, may not always act with the promptness which the situation requires so that in an emergency there is really need for the concentration of power in one man. This may well be the reason why Act No. 671 in express terms authorizes the President to exercise the emergency powers “during the existence of the emergency” and not merely during the time that the Legislature could be in session. For one thing to make the life of the emergency powers depend upon the inability of the Legislature to meet is the same as to declare those emergency powers automatically ended the moment they were conferred, for at that very moment of the Legislature that conferred them was in session.
