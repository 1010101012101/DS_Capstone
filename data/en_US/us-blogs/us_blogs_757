dancing to fresedo at the practica with a favorite leader, i become aware that we are listening and interpreting IN THE SAME WAY. i know, at the same time that he does, what he wants. i am smiling. then, a passage builds to what i believe must be an inevitable boleo. i wait with giddy anticipation, "will he won't he will he won't he..." and then, a subtle change of momentum, he leads a gentle boleo...
"You need to remember you're not my Four Knot anymore." As the words left his mouth, Rel realised he'd overdone it. Vulnerable and confused as Dora was, the loss of the authority she'd cherished was the worst of her wounds from the second Gift. If he backed down now, though, it would be to capitulate to the repugnant suggestion about Taslin, and the thought alone left a rancid taste in his mouth. He spun on his heel before Dora's brimming tears washed away his resolve. "I came here to do a job. I'm going to go and do it. You can follow when you've calmed down."

My mobile phone, an essential tool in my job hunt is on the wane,the screen is knackered and dropping it on concrete yesterday didn’t help either. The smart thing to do would be to get it fixed or replaced. Thankfully those nice people at Virgin Mobile (who one can talk to after 9 minutes listening to a choice of pop or classical musak) are able to help and my monthly bills are set to reduce… Ker-ching!

I've been critical of alternatives because I know first-hand the amount of nonsense that is going on in this overhyped industry. Too many pension fund managers are enamored, intimidated by "star" managers in this space and they get hoodwinked into investing in 'brand names" without understanding the risks of the strategy and the correlation with other asset classes.
I've been tempting fate this past week or so. I have started planting the garden already. The temps have been above normal by just a bit. The last few days and the next few to come are supposed to be very warm. So soil temps are high enough to try some seed in the soil. This morning I found some spinach sprouts poking out of the ground. These first few weeks of gardening season seem to be a bit of a scurry. Gotta try to get as much in the ground that the weather will allow. Clean barns, amend beds. Blackfly season will be upon us soon and even though the spring chores will still beckon no one really wants to be outside when they begin to hatch. With this warm weather it will be here sooner than most years.

My favorite novels this year were invariable those that weren't afraid to create something new by melding all genres. I think it would behoove publishers to leave the New Weird name in the dust and simply refer to these novels Cross Genre as that area seems to be growing with the likes of Ken Scholes laying the groundwork the last couple of years. Newton's City of Ruin simply blew me away. He built the world so well with Nights of Villjamur and than went and changed the game completely in exciting and strange ways. While Huso brought in Horror, Sci-Fi, with a Fantasy feel into strangely beautiful yet grotesque places. Ian Whates is another debut author who hasn't been getting mention many places and while his style isn't as devious as Newton or Huso his world-building is an intense affair. City of Dreams and Nightmare envisions a city size building of 100 floors where different sects live on each level that has been built over thousands of years. The first novel merely sets the stage for some odd happenings that are sure to fill-in this world.
I hope your year has gotten off to a great start!

To Dr.Hessler, I want to specifically express how great it was to meet you, and how you’re nothing like all of the terrible stories Professor Woodworth tells us. You don’t look remotely like a balrog. My biggest regret is that we weren’t able to spend more time with you and your students. That’s likely the only thing I would’ve changed. Perhaps next time.
The reason for this pesticide concentration is the salmon feed. Pesticides, including those now outlawed in the United States, have circulated into the ocean where they are absorbed by marine life and accumulate in their fat, which is distilled into the concentrated fish oil that is a major ingredient in salmon feed. Salmon feed contains higher concentrations of fish oil-extracted from sardines, anchovies and other ground-up fish-than wild salmon normally consume. Scientists in the U.S. are currently trying to determine the extent of the pesticide contamination in farmed salmon and what levels are safe for human consumption.
“Shakespeare’s Riddle for Today’s Rosicrucians: Hidden Messages in the 1609 Dedication to the Sonnets” For the past four centuries, the enigmatic dedication to the 1609 edition of Shakespeare’s Sonnets has hidden the author’s plea to future generations of Rosicrucians and Freemasons to understand his story and bestow upon his beloved son the immortality of literature. The man who used the pen name of “William Shakespeare” reveals through symbols, codes, and cryptography that his true surname was DeVere, that he loved a woman named Elisabeth, and that they had a love child they could not acknowledge, Henry Wriothesley, to whom the sonnets were dedicated. DeVere’s natural son, Henry Wriothesley, raised as the Third Earl of Southampton, was the “fair youth” of the first 17 sonnets, as well as the mysterious dedicatee “Mr. W. H.” with his initials anagrammed. In 2007, the author published her findings in the Rose Croix Journal. In this presentation, she will demonstrate how she deciphered the message and how it throws new light onto the orthodox interpretations of the poetry and plays.
William Shatner, who is the star of today's film, continued to get sporadic work, post Trek, most of which were bit parts in made for TV movies and cult films, like "The Devil's Rain". Probably the most notable of all of these, is the 1977 John "Bud" Cardos horror, "Kingdom of the Spiders."

These stories of heartbreak repeated all over the city. Those of us who stayed went through a myriad of emotions. At first we felt deserted and hurt by many departures of our friends and families. They just left, as if nothing mattered to them, or so we thought. Then, after the first year or so, we became resentful. We imagined our departed friends in fancy schools, partying and living the teenage life to its fullest, while we sat in basements, struggling to find food and water and chancing death every minute.

Or you keep your facebook page for close friends (a circle of 150) and use other networks for weak ties?

Game of Thrones: The RPG will be released on 15 May in the United States but, completely inexplicably, won't be out in Europe until 1 June (since clearly it takes two weeks for digital information to cross the Atlantic). The publishers, in their wisdom, have also decided the release the game on the same day as Max Payne 3 (one of the biggest games of the year on both console and PC) and Diablo III (probably the biggest game of the year on PC). In fact, they've somehow managed to cross with both dates for Max Payne 3 (which is out on 15 May on console and 1 June on PC).

I would like to mention about two of these libraries that have been most important. One was central library in Chandigarh, where I was member for many years. That place has been most influential in creating the habit of reading English books in me. Another was the office library of C-DOT where I worked for many years. Normally, corporate libraries are not that great but the librarian here was really good and he had nurtured this place for many years making it one of the best source of technical information.

Why? I suppose it’s a bit like spring cleaning for the soul. I have the propensity to take on too much because I think I can handle it all. Some days I can. Other days, I go under without enough air a little too often. This last year has been more difficult than usual. Between moving, our oldest daughter getting married, the economy drastically affecting our business, big changes and growth in our home and on our little mini-farm, trying to keep up with home-schooling a quickly advancing child, writing and publishing commitments, church commitments, etc., etc., etc., I am having to come to terms with my humanity.

Back to that theme I spoke about early in the review. There are far too many holes in the Direct POD services. I actually think they inadvertently constrained themselves by getting into the whole publishing package avenue, and would do far better to offer a full bespoke list of services. What bugged me was that a printer would offer their own registered ISBN’s, when they are only a printer. That seems a fixed reality if authors do plum for a publishing package. Likewise, as much as Direct POD does promote the few books they have printed for self-published authors and small presses on their printer site, they seem caught between two stools as a company.
All the work got borken up by various trips out of the house.

The likes of opener ‘The Lion’s Roar’ and ‘Wolf’ are more forthright, sitting at the blustery, battle-worn end of the folk spectrum. The former has a cinematic quality, prefaced by skeletal chords that become bolder and brasher each time they are returned to over the song’s ritualistic five minutes, while a pagan flute melody blows a cold chill through the rest of the record. Then ‘Wolf’, with its sinister chants and forest setting, powerfully evokes the darkest, most dangerous rural landscapes.
Grapefruit bombs were unleashed, and their presence was immediately acknowledged. But the M Battalion were swift into battle as well.

One final issue that I ran into while making this skirt was dealing with the thickness of the fabric. The green flower fabric is thick and the embroidery makes it even thicker. And when you don’t cut the panels perfectly and all of that falls on a seam it’s too thick for the sewing machine. One area I just had to skip over. It doesn’t look the nicest, but I got the job done. In the future I’ll have to make sure to pick fabric that is a little less thick.

BPD awareness needs to be more public. I wish many of the disorder experience the same public treatment as depression and anxeity currently is in Canada. No one has even a basic understanding of what BPD is and if there is an understanding it is so far off that it’s painful. I occasionally hear “Oh but you’re so nice!” when disclose that I have been diagnosed with BPD. What a surprise it must be to learn that someone with a personality disorder can be nice!? I know it’s a surprise for me to learn that I’m supposed to be mean!

A question: Do I allow a 14 year old girl (very good, kind, naive, religious girl), to have popular rock songs on her ipod that are riddled with sexual innuendo (if you want to call it innuendo!), and other nasty themes? She doesn't know about the birds and the bees yet (homeschooled!), and just loves music, the beat, etc. I feel like the Grinch telling her she's got to go find something more suitable, as almost nothing on the local radio station is suitable (especially when I consider my choices at her age), but yet I feel a horrible pang of guilt every time I download another icky pop favorite for her. I've explained my reluctance to her in that most of these songs glorify sin, especially against the 6th commandment. She doesn't quite get what that means. Is it time for 'the talk'? Do I cut the cord on the music? Am I overreacting? Any input would be appreciated!
So, after a lot of postponing this trip finally happened. I wanted to go to explore this area of California for a long time. Some years ago my friends and I were traveling in Trinity Alps and eventually ended up in Eureka. We were driving back on 101 and I saw this gorgeous forest all around the two lane highway. It was beautiful. Much more than any of that I-5 desert. So, as it often happens, I had the seed planted in my heart for this place.

Educators train students to use the language "properly," that is, teach them mainstream grammar, syntax, and usage. In doing this, they are like photosynthesis and its related processes, bringing nutrients to the roots. When this happens, private language changes. Students begin to think in a less unique and more conventional fashion. This is good in that students need to use standard language in order to operate smoothly within the culture; it is bad in that it squelches the most unique and unusual aspects of language.
I did balk at the "love triangle" of Katniss, Gale, and Peeta. I feared it would be similar to that of the Twilight series with vacuous Bella mooning over controlling Edward. Katniss, in contrast, wasn't pining for anyone. She cared deeply for both youths, but was too busy surviving to waste much time examining potential romantic relationships. Each youth represented an aspect of Katniss: do whatever is necessary to survive versus maintaining her humanity against all odds. Who would she be by the final pages of the third book?

Not wanting to be left behind, Dominique Strauss-Kahn around the same time expressed his desire for a Europe stretching “from the cold ice of the Arctic in the North to the hot sands of the Sahara in the South … and that Europe, I believe, if it continues to exist, will have reconstituted the Mediterranean as an internal sea, and will have reconquered the space that the Romans, or Napoleon more recently, attempted to consolidate.”

Seven years later, Gilchrist tells Yahoo News that the Minutemen Project has petered out amid expensive legal battles over control of the group. Some of his former comrades attempted to fire him as president, alleging that he was using the group’s funds inappropriately. He countersued for defamation and lost, but eventually won back control of the group in court. Outspoken activists mainly interested in money and fame infiltrated the ranks and tried to take over, says Gilchrist, distracting from the original goal of border watching. “There are bad apples,” he said. “There are some in any group.”

Obviously this changed with the printing press, which provided the ability to make multiple copies of documents relatively quickly and easily. So governments regulated printers (and pretty much still do) to try and control what information was disseminated. What makes the internet and social media so different is that you don’t need expensive printing and distribution channels – you can tweet or send a Facebook update using a mobile phone or PC from anywhere. Governments can track down who is responsible, but it takes time, hence the wholesale banning of social media
Rather cryptic, don’t you think? It has an heir of inescapable mystery, one cannot deny. Now, I can look into this as an insight into a past life; a clue to the life of a spirit who once lived a unique, yet not so different life as my own. I can also look at it as a foreshadowing of things to come. Ultimately, as a gamer — if you read that one blog not too long ago — I can look at this as both my character’s class and backstory. Personally, I’ve always come to think of the derived meanings of our names as possible standards to live by. In any event, it’s all just fascinating enough to enter into the journal that is my blog. Which I am pleased to share with you all here, today.

Writing in Prospect magazine, she said: ‘The more we seek to measure racism, the more it seems to grow. ‘Teachers are now required to report incidents of racist abuse among children as young as three to local authorities, resulting in a massive increase of cases and reinforcing the perception that we need an army of experts to manage race relations from cradle to grave.

In a small Indian village Mandwa, Vijay Dinanath Chauhan (Hrithik Roshan) is taught about the path of fire (Agneepath) by his principled father. His life is shattered completeley when the evil drug lord Kancha Cheena (Sanjay Dutt) hangs his father to death. Vijay leaves for Bombay with his pregnant mother played by Zarina Wahab, and takes an oath that he will return to Mandwa someday and bring back the glory of his father name. In Bombay, 12 Year-old Vijay is taken under the wings of the city`s drug lord Rauf Lala (Rishi Kapoor). From here on, it is a journey of revenge where he makes and breaks many relationships only to get closer to his aim. Vijay finds support in his only friend Kaali (Priyanka Chopra), who stands by him at every moment of his life. Fifteen Years later, his hatred for Kancha takes him back to Mandwa. Agneepath is a remake of the Hindi film of the same name starring Amitabh Bachchan which fetched him a national award.

The film is about a painfully shy man named Lars. He lives in the outdoor garage of his brother and sister-in-law’s home. Lars is a good guy. He attends church, goes to work and is a sweet person. The problem is that Lars is not very social. He tends to spend most of his time in the garage. One day Lars goes to his brother’s house with the news that he has met someone. His brother and his wife are thrilled and cannot wait to meet this girl. It turns out, that the girl Lars was talking about is a sex doll he ordered offline. But in Lars’ mind he thinks that the doll is real. The film is about how this small town deals with this situation and help Lars as best they can. That’s the movie, I know it sounds ridiculous but the outcome is incredible.

This kuih is quite easy to cut as it is not too soft. It's not hard either. The sweetness level is just nice.... I like it. However, I find the kuih not rich enough. So, the next time I make this & if I'm using fresh coconut milk, I need to increase it & adjust the water level accordingly. One more thing, I used the Prima brand of semolina. I realize it is too fine. As a result, the bottom level of the kuih lacks the granular texture. Apparently, there are other brands that carry coarser semolina......so I need to bear that in mind.

Luke’s project will be on display at Brighton’s final year product design show at the university which runs from 1st to 4th June.
I find much to like about Glenn Beck. I admire his willingness to witness for God on his program, his courage in connecting the dots of those who are trying to destroy our country, and his emphasis on the virtues of faith, hope, and charity.

For me, the Christian faith is exclusively for these moments; moments of pain and struggle. This book is for all of us, wherever our relationship with God may be. This book is intended for those on a journey (and walk with this Jesus) who want to know, what now?

I know, that's rich coming from somebody who got everything they wanted today, but last year I thought twice about the St Etienne box set and decided not to buy it, as it was too expensive at thirty quid; for months it was on ebay for fifty/sixty quid. Three months ago I got a copy from a seller on ebay for £13 including postage.

Today was the day when I realized that there are some things in the world that i’m good at, like making sudden loud noises, and some things that I’m pretty bad at, like scooping ice cream with a normal spoon, and that makes me pretty frustrated but not as frustrated as that one time when I tried to seal an entire pot of cooked macaroni into a Ziplock bag that had a tear in it’s side and I still tried to fill and seal it despite my knowledge that it would likely burst and fling itself all across my floor and end up underneath my oven, which it did, and would probably rot for the next five years and stink up the place until the one day when I finally moved out and had to clean behind the oven to keep my landlord happy so I don’t have to pay for the security deposit that will would have surely ruined me financially to the point where I would have had to use coins I’d been collecting since third grade so I could finally buy that life-sized Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle I saw at the store that one time.

Before I added the Stickles, I cut the piece out with Nestabilities, embossing it with that fabulous new No More Shims Embossing Mat. I glued a layer of green cardstock onto a white card base, and covered it with a piece of printed vellum I had in my stash that was perfect for the watery scene. The image was then popped up on some Dimensional Dots. Once it was all put together, I put the whole thing back in the carton and gave it another shot with the Fireworks to give it just a little bit of subtle shimmer.

Last Saturday my wife surprised me with a lovely present. After the clan had demolished the bacon and eggs served up for our now traditional Saturday morning brunch, we cleaned the yolk out of the one-year-old's hair and fed the dog his share of the leftover bacon. Then I was handed a little cardboard box from Amazon. I knew what it was from the dimensions right away as me and my siblings had chipped in and bought one for my dad at Crimbo. Plus the product name was stamped on the box. It was a Kindle!
Our Bargain or Freebie this week is "Just for You" Flower Sentiment. I love this sentiment because you can use it alone on your creation, or you can make it smaller and use it to compliment any DIGITAL DELIGHTS image.
It's all about sharing and caring of course so there will be no winners or losers :) However, I will pick the soup that I think is the most new and exciting and re blog it with a link back to your original recipe.
Car sales have been poor since 2007 with owners postponing changing their cars which are most likely to be reliable and durable enough to hold onto. If their car is something like a Focus, Astra, Scenic, Zafira then their versatility probably still suits, whilst engine efficiency and general running costs have been good enough. Who’d pay thousands even tens of thousands to change their cars for the same type of car with small improvements?
Hi there! Just a quick post today to share my projects with this month's LE kit from My Creative Scrapbook. With Christmas only a couple of weeks, I'm sure you're in the mood for some holiday crafting. You'll love this beautiful kit which includes a wonderful mix of My Mind's Eye Lost & Found Christmas and Simple Stories 25 Days of Christmas. I really enjoyed working with it and here's what I created...

In the end we decided that we wanted Rachel to have a broader social communuity experience, mixing with other cultures and religions as part of her school years. Through my role in the church we knew she'd get good christian messages and lessons and have a christian network, but we really felt that appreciating the beliefs and lives of others would stand her in better stead for the future. We also loved the fact that she would walk to school with me and when she was older on her own, and that her friends would all be local.

I spent the following weeks and months wallowing in devastation. And truthfully, there are moments now when it washes over me like waves crashing against the beach at high tide, covering all of the beauty that shows in the daylight. It leaves me gasping, struggling to breathe.

Kelly Anne was stunning in a dress fit for a princess, and she practically bounced down the aisle toward Dave. She has always looked forward to her wedding day, and I think she had a blast. I know I had a great time with my college friends. We talked, danced, ate, drank, and celebrated. Two of them even “respectfully” crashed the wedding next door. From the pictures, they look like they had way too much fun. Have to say, I was always curious about real wedding crashers since the movie, and now I know two! The best part was seeing how happy Kelly Anne was to be with Dave and to have all of us with her to party for her day. It’s the sort of joy I wish for every bride on her wedding day.
We’re just starting to kayak…our adventurous spirit is reviving from a near death experience as we finally shed some of this horrible weight…and we spent about an hour on a calm pond next to the river in town trying out different kinds and sizes of boats. (Or, in the vernacular, “yaks.”) Afterward we decided to drive up into the reservoir system northeast of Boise to scout for more exciting places to paddle once we spread our wings.
Now I usually would say anything negative is the universe trying to tell you that you are focusing on the negative and trying to remind you to be positive, but when something happens over and over and over again no matter what you do to stop it then the universe is screaming at you that you need to learn something. What? I don’t know, this is the universe talking to you not me. But if it keeps happening clearly, you’re not learning what you should.

Resting the voice is important, particularly for people like teachers, politicians, or actors who talk for long periods. Not speaking for a time is one way to rest the voice.
To be able to go anywhere, talk all day without interruption. To cover every topic with analysis and humor and intensity. To visit every park that looks like a Van Gogh and laugh at the sparkling water and towering sunflowers and endless fields because they are so much smaller than we are. To lock eyes for hours just because our time is unlimited. To search each other’s faces until we feel so overcome that the only natural thing to do is to kiss.
Sometimes, the river was so packed with ice that an ice bridge would form and people could walk between Manhattan and Brooklyn over it. But this didn’t always work out so well. The following is an excerpt from an Eagle article of March 13, 1888, reporting on the first ice bridge to have formed on the river since 1875.
"Though fans of Wolfe, a.k.a. Randy California (the nick-name given him by Hendrix in order to differentiate from another Randy in his mid 60's band) are well familiar with the fact that he was a protege of the great Jimi Hendrix, many might have been left wondering when, if ever, Hendrix's influence would take effect. They were no longer wondering once he left Spirit to release this solo effort. Filled with heavy guitar driven psychedelic hard rock, Hendrix similarities abound, though I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a long lost Hendrix album, per se. But it should appeal to fans of the great one. Grades - 1 A-, 3 B+'s, 2 B's, a B-, and a C-, that last grade a totally out of place cover of Paul Simon's "Mother and Child Reunion" - what was he thinking? Original first issues came out on the yellow Epic label."
This is a co-ordinated attack by the 'State' to destablise patriotic anti-EU and anti-immigration movements and stop professional and highly intelligent people getting interested by making the movement look thuggish and sexually perverted - to destroy faith in Nationalist parties before the economy collapses or ethnic violence breaks out. I wonder how many sleepers are in the Conservative Monday Club or The Traditional Britain Group?
In March a Financial Times article was titled “Bleak Outlook for U.S. Newspapers” and called them “America’s fastest-shrinking industry.” Advertising revenues are half what they were in 2005 and now at 1984’s levels. Part of the challenge has come from the growth of the Internet as the go-to source for news, but part can be attributed to the loss of confidence in the objectivity and accuracy of what newspapers, with exceptions, report as news or fail to report entirely. For those like myself who began his career as a reporter and editor, that is sad news, but Christopher B. Daly, a veteran journalist and historian, has just had a splendid book published, Covering America: A Narrative History of a Nation’s Journalism ($49.95, University of Massachusetts Press) that will please its readers on many levels. Daly remains optimistic, noting that American journalism has always been challenged, going through deep change in the 1830s and again in the 1920s. Daly provides a lively, interesting review of journalism’s many personalities, events and trends. It is an excellent work of history concerning the profession and business of journalism, filled with anecdotes and intriguing facts. It surely belongs on the shelves everywhere journalism is celebrated.
This man of God Jeshua or Jesus of Nazareth, who, being the outshining of his glory, the true image of his substance, supporting all things by the word of his power, having given himself as an offering making clean from sins, took his seat at the right hand of God in heaven;” He always had the glory of God and was given the Holy Spirit, so that he went about doing good and making well all who were troubled by evil spirits, for God was with him. (Hebrews 1:3 ; Acts 10:38)
Zantric’s duel with the blood knight proved the fighter’s prowess–emboldened by the danger faced by his friends, the vampire champion was taken by surprise by the man’s potency–and after the pair fought for only two rounds, the vampire was forced into a gaseous form and send withdrawing to his coffin–trailing unsurprisingly towards the temple-city of Tsar. Again the vampire spawn fled the field–while the hidden vampire left a parting gift, erupting a powerful fireball which felled the dwarves much to the party’s outcry. Brother Vang moved quickly to aid the fallen defenders while all eyes turned towards the north as a new arrival set their hearts to sink again.

I'm convinced now. They had everything. Not just everything, but everything going back a couple of years. They had at least 3 cases of Boulevard Imperial Stout batch 2, but that wasn't that impressive since the other store I hit in Wichita also had at least a case. But they had Schlafly's Barleywines going back to 2006, same with the Schlafly Imperial Stout. Goebel would be the best beer store in Missouri too if everything that's available in Missouri were available for them to sell. It was ridiculous.

Here are a few possible topics I've brainstormed:
Bitterness is a choice we make. No one can force another person to be bitter. a bitter person thinks that they can be bitter in just one area of there life but that bitterness will affect and interupt every area of that persons life. Bitterness cannot be contained because it is a flaw in a persons attitude, character, and spiritual life.

The beginner box is a perfect product for a fast and furious game of “basic” d&d which after all these years of numbers crunching “new school” complexity comes as a refreshing change of pace. I could see playing a mini campaign up to level five taking anywhere from 3 months to a year of real time. This sounds pretty good, and right about where my attention and passion for grand campaigns stand.

Your baby weighs about 8 1/2 ounces and measures 6 inches, head to bottom — about the size of a large heirloom tomato. Her arms and legs are in the right proportions to each other and the rest of her body now. Her kidneys continue to make urine and the hair on her scalp is sprouting. A waxy protective coating called the vernix caseosa is forming on her skin to prevent it from pickling in the amniotic fluid.

Or so I thought. But even modern formal photographs reveal vulnerability the moment we understand what they really are – a manifestation of how the subject actually wants to be seen. In ordinary life we protect ourselves with a string of familiar excuses (‘What, this old rag? I only flung it on at the last minute’) but there’s no escape in a photo. Like it or not, we’re telling the viewer ‘I think I look nice in this dress, I think this expression is particularly winsome’. When the dress doesn’t actually work the result can be devastating. One of my favourite photographs is of a baptism group always known in the family (rather unkindly) as ‘Auntie Mary’s Shoes’…

I blame Mad Men. Bert Cooper keeps quoting Ayn Rand. I’ve heard constant references made to Atlas Shrugged and about how it’s such an important novel. One of my Facebook friends has gone so far to exclaim that this book has made the most impact on his life, next to the Bible. I guess a lot of people think that.

It's probably because I don't ask for any beer. But if someone decides they want to send me some - I'm not going to say no! And it certainly would be rude not to give the beer a review, that's for sure. (that's my opinion anyway - good or bad)

These tissues too have their parasites and panaceas, and padding the vast supra-existential spaces are entities who would ruffle and crease, or brush out the folds and smoothe the wrinkles away. These types arise in and reflect those of the worlds themselves, for good or ill.
Side note: I just had a one hour conference call with Amazon yesterday about the November 22 release of STIRRED, and it blows me away how smart these folks are. It was unlike any conversation I've ever had with any Big 6 publisher. Amazon truly understands that an essential part of making money is treating authors fairly. They pay much better than the Big 6, listen to and implement authors' ideas, and understand numbers on a near-savant level.
I received my copy from B&H Fiction in exchange for my honest review. "Lost and Found" is mildly recommended. But Definitely check out Ginny Yttrup's debut novel, "Words". THAT book is HIGHLY recommended!!

DSC calls for grassroots organising and communicative social action on the part of poor women, minorities and others who have been consistently and increasingly marginalised and left out in the process of social change (Kaye 1990; Servaes 1999)). DSC posits the ‘community’ as the unit and level of analysis, and the participation of communities in the design and implementation of development programmes is important. DSC views participation and dialogue as a means for local people and communities to engage with and influence their development (Servaes 1995). Development Support Communication thus becomes understood as a two-way process in which communities participate as main agents in setting development goals and standards. Added to this, the notion of participation is deepened by the emphasis on community access. As a result, interpersonal approaches are now recognised alongside mass media communication as vital to achieving the impact, (Melkote 1991). Johnson (1992) argues that participation is central in the empowerment of the grassroots as participation results in self- reliance. DSC encourages the marginalised to plan for their own development programmes, thus ending dependency. As Rowlands (1997) points out, “disassociation from the central power holders is only the first step in self-reliance”. DSC facilitators ensure this disassociation by breaking the power structures and helping the marginalised to access resources so that they will use them to their advantage. White (2004) stresses that it makes little sense to talk of community empowerment through participatory communication and dialogue in the absence of change in the existing power structures.

“The rule is 100 years old. We’ve come a long way in those 100 years in this country in the way that we involve and included people with disabilities. And I think its time that the rule catches up with that,” says Dean Dompierre.
Such thinking goes back at least as far as Max Weber’s argument that an effective business environment requires a legal structure as predictable as a clock. Investors, it is thought, need clear rules and effective courts. Security of contract and strong mechanisms that protect investors are, in this view, foundational for finance, which in turn fuels economic growth. If a potential financier is unsure of being repaid, he or she will not invest, firms will not grow, and economic development will stall. Rules and institutions come first; real economic development follows.
Haywire is far from Soderbergh's best or most ambitious film, but it's a pretty great example of a genre picture done right. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it sets a new standard for the genre, but it's definitely an action movie well worth seeing.

We applied for the adoption of Toby and were delighted to welcome Toby into our family. The first six months with Toby, who was five when we adopted him from a local rescue organization, were almost perfect. Shortly thereafter, this seemingly perfect pet turned into quite the incorrigible dog breaking toilet tank lids, turning water taps on and routinely emptying closets and rearranging the furniture.

That was usually my mom’s job, although I do remember getting spanked by my dad once, after we broke the bed (he did warn us a few times not to be jumping on the bed). My dad was usually either at work, asleep, or at the cantina, so he really never had the chance to punish us. Don’t get me wrong I love my dad, God rest his soul, but my mom did most of the parenting.

FAQs
I’m going to go ahead and get the sides out of the way before moving on to the meat. Most of these are just standard sides that you get at almost any BBQ place in Texas. The beans are just regular barracho beans which Texas is know for serving with everything BBQ related. While I am from the east coast originally and prefer BBQ baked beans these actually had a pretty nice flavor. The Cole slaw was a little bit better than most places but was still not the Cole slaw I grew up on. Most Texas restaurants make Cole slaw by shredding cabbage and dousing it in vinegar, where I am used to it having a little more creaminess to it with a little mayo and sugar added. Basically I like Cole slaw to have flavor and most of the restaurants out here do not make it that way. Now we move on to the potato salad which they take a different approach to making. This is a non mayo based potato salad that has more of a mustard flavoring to it. While it came off a little bland to me it was still pretty good, and when you added some of the signature BBQ sauce to it it was fantastic. Those are the big guns for the sides and while they were OK I am sure that they are not the reason that most people visit The Salt Lick.
I am a huge Twitter fan both for personal and educational use. But if you have ever tried to participate in an online Twitter event, keeping up with hundreds of comments can be overwhelming. Last week I ran across a very smart free and easy tool, TwitterFall. It allows you to easily follow conferences, chat sessions, or events via the use of Twitter hashtags (#). All you have to do is enter the hashtag of the event and the program automatically finds and queues in all tweeted comments. And for multi-taskers, you can follow several events at once.

Why is it, then, that when two individuals as prominent as Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree) and Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth) come together to make a wonderful, wonderful album that stands just as tall as the classic stuff I just mentioned, they get slapped around with negative reviews across the blog and review sphere by the very same type who are just as quick to praise the ghostly tuneage of the distant past?

Each morning we begin with a morning message. Now at the beginning of the school year, I write the morning message on the chart paper and we interact with the message from there. However, by October, I begin using the promethean board as a more interactive, engaging way to do our morning message. I type a message about our days. It could be that we go to the computer lab, it's picture day, or about the big storm that blew through last night. I keep the format pretty simple and standardized. I think this is important in kinder because they need to know what to expect from the morning message. It goes something like this:

Being shy and quiet isn’t a bad thing. In fact, you are probably a more thoughtful, observant person and you are very good when it comes to chosing the right people to trust. But I also know that you don’t voice your opinion as much or can laugh or joke about something as freely as others can. So while being a quiet person has it’s pros, it also has it’s cons.
The research I conducted with AFS alumni from the 1980s suggested a relationship between international experiences and intercultural sensitivity, but so often the first experience came from childhood exposure to other countries and cultures, and especially from parents who encouraged their children to meet people from other countries and cultures. The fact that participation in an AFS high school program so often runs in a family reinforces this theme: the motivation is already there.
While research does not show that eliminating gluten from your diet directly leads to weight loss, several studies show that making healthy changes to your diet can promote weight loss. The reason why numerous individuals lose weight on the gluten-free diet is that they are consuming fewer processed and fast food items. By replacing processed foods and empty carbohydrates with fresh fruits and vegetables, dieters can expect to see a lower number on the scale.

We'll re-paint the walls, of course, and eventually there'll be no physical traces at all. But it's those late night/early morning trips to the toilet that I think are going to be a continuing, although hopefully not permanent, reminder. I've had to go to the loo a couple of times since around the same sort of time, and each time as I sit there I can't help but run through it all in my head again, all the while hoping, praying that I won't start to feel queasy or hot. Meanwhile, next door in bed, Rachel is that little bit more awake than she previously would have been, that little bit more aware. I think that's just the way it's going to be for the two of us. For a while, anyway.
“I’m all for standing up for what you believe in, but whether or not using the Eucharist as a tool in that is another thing,” McGraw said.
It’s great that they’ve combined two massive registries – although there are limitations with that – and tried to account for some of the unmeasured confounders, however I’m not entirely sure this ends the argument once and for all. At the end of the day, it is a non-randomised cohort, and patients were different. Selection bias is prevalent in this type of study, particulalry when it comes to cardiology studies.

In a different context, Lewis discussed the views of Karl Kautsky in 1904–5, when he called for a democratic republic along the lines of the Paris Commune as the political form of working-class emancipation. Ottokar Luban, a member of the International Rosa Luxemburg Society, noted the same advocacy of radical democracy in Luxemburg’s struggle to oppose Social Democratic reformism. By 1919, Lewis said, Kautsky’s support of a democratic republic had been gutted of any revolutionary content.

Dark wood, light paint, bar with rows of taps along the back wall – the Fuller Thomson style is getting easier to recognise. Formulaic as it is, it wouldn’t be enough to tempt me here on its own, but beer consultant Chris Mair has put together a beer list worth travelling for. From the revered Kernel of Bermondsey there was Export Stout and from Luckie, a semi-hobby brewery even smaller than The Kernel, whose beers are even more rarely seen on draught even in Scotland, a strong mild. Making its Edinburgh debut, the experimental Fyne Davaar IPA in pale and black versions, which London got before we did (pah!). All from the cask as God intended. For kegophiles there was Summer Wine Maelstrom, Hardknott Vitesse Noir and Brooklyn Sorachi Ace and some others that I've forgotten.

Oh, and the soldiers you see? There were two more. So, maybe five in total? And they were YOUNG.

“Sometimes the spiritual master is addressed as Prabhupada. Prabhu means “the Supreme Personality of Godhead,” and pada means “post.” According to Vaishnava philosophy, the spiritual master occupies the post of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or in other words he is the bona fide representative of the Supreme Lord.”

So the saying “Jumpier than a one-legged man in a butt kicken contest” could not describe me more. I don’t like being scared. Nothing is worse than watching a scary movie and having someone scare you just before you are “supposed” to get scared or having someone come up behind you unexpectedly. I had an incident that happened to me a few years ago that almost ruined my life as I know it.

There is news of a sperm bank that is so awash with the stuff, that it has decided to be selective in who can and can't donate their gentleman's relish. In this process they are declining to take further donations from red-heads. Apparently, there isn't as much demand for theirs as there is supply. I'm not sure if this means red-head sperm is unpopular or just that red-heads are prolific and very generous masturbaters. If' it's the former, then it does tell us something about kind of prejudice there is out there against "the gingers".
“Over,” I say, and my dog and I cross the road. Overnight, after oversleeping, I’ve become overcome with cold. I’m usually overrun with chores but today I’m taking it easy.

"I have always been in the service industry, I started working in a fast food restaurant at 14 in order to pay for me playing sports. As soon as I turned 21, I begged the manager to let me bartend or to let one of the bartenders show how to. But, since we already had "veterans" I wasn't given a chance until much later. But, I always watched how the bartenders bartended. It wasn't about "just making drinks", there was a science behind it and it intrigued me. It was more personal than waitressing and not as much work AND way more money... So when I was finally given my chance behind the bar, I soaked it all up. Tasting all the different liquors and wines we had was an eye opening experience because up to that point, all I knew was commercial brands of liquor. I looked forward to when beer, liquor or wine reps that would come in with new samples of products. I did some research on my own and taken a few of classes on spirits, but this is just one dimension of the whole bartending experience..."
I have not been doing much crafting the last week or so. We are remodeling our house so I have not been able to do much else.

One of my own personal gentleman's agreement-style bonds is captured in the picture below, circa 1991. It wasn't quite the gentleman's agreement of Cooper and March and Hopkins because she was his girlfriend but the effect was the same as in Design for Living, a three way love affair for alcoholic ages: he and I were in a band together and housemates; her and I played a lot of gin and drank a lot of gin. The three of us went everywhere together. We were like Design for Living times Performance! In some ways, my relationship with the both of them was 'purer' then theirs as a couple. They fought and sulked and needled and I rose above it all like a third wheel spinning in the sky; my own girlfriend snug and quiet in her genie bottle of Old Grandad (green label).

My opinion from being raised in a double digit family. No one raised in one ever wants to have one because they know how totally unfair it is to each child. And that woman – she is a birther not a mother – did it intentionally for selfish gain. She intentionally chose to neglect the six children she already had in order to fulfill her delusional fantasy. She intentionally created eight more lives when she couldn’t care for the six she had already created in a laboratory.

It is not enough to hope for a better future. You must imagine it and define it. Intention starts as a thought inside your head. Then you should speak that goal, and write it down. Discuss your goal with people you trust. Finally you must take action, purposeful continuous action. By performing these steps you’ll begin to manifest your intentions, and build the career of your dreams.

I did a layer of light gray, and then a couple coats of black. The writing is in white.

One thing that my students are doing, along with several other teachers in my department, is a 20 Book Challenge to end the school year. For this final Semester (two terms), we've asked the students to participate in a challenge to read 10 books each term. They do have a variety of categories/genres to choose from, but they pretty much get to choose what they would like to read. In short, we just want them to READ. The fun part for me is that I'm doing it with them so we can all share what we're reading. That has really helped me get moving on my own 100 Book Challenge for the year!
Skye is trying to pull herself up all the time now and is very cute. Still not easy to make her smile like Max was but it is more rewarding when she does.
In a class today, while being asked questions by the teacher, I found myself looking over her shoulder at the paper she held with the answers. Three of us were standing at the board, ready to write but I’ll read anything and just didn’t even think about it until my eyes darted to the printing on the page and she clasped the paper against her.
I will bore you if I tell you the logistical difficulties posed by organising a party in a venue with no refridgeration or washing-up facilities; not helped by many people not having replied to the invitation. The fact that we have a fabulous line-up of about 80 guests along with our 100 members is at the same time wonderful, and yet daunting. I'm not going to name them, because that would be tacky and I'm not tacky, but I will say that if you had told me during my years of dismal failure to get published, that one day I would chair an AGM at which Margaret Drabble would be a guest, I would have said you were delusional. I am sure that the last thing she really wants to do on a sunny day in the book festival is listen to me witter on, but she is. And I'm very grateful to her.

We flooded onto the platform and up the first bank of escalators, then a steep staircase where we marched out of the subway pit proper. The soaring expanses of glass and steel amplified the echoed din as an even more massive bank of escalators lifted us to street level, those who rode yielding right to stair climbers who passed on the left, their stomp in a rhythmic cadence as strong as a battalion. Upon landing, I would scoot across the ceramic concourse and through the gleaming lobby of the North Tower. I knew the silken, seconds-long elevator rides, too, when I was working on the 72nd floor of the South Tower in 2000. I was a contractor then, and I also worked on the 32nd floor of the Deutsche Bank Building. I was offered permanent positions at each, but declined both because the fit wasn't right. I look on those career decisions with belated gratitude. I do believe they helped save my life.

I first came across Benjamin Fulford whilst researching Psyclone, through a very thought-provoking report concerning a covert global depopulation policy. Former Asia-Pacific Bureau chief for Forbes magazine, Benjamin Fulford. In the course of his investigations into artificially created pandemics that targeted Asians (SARS/Avian Flu), Fulford was tasked to act as a spokesperson for “a powerful organisation with deeply embedded networks in Japanese society”. Through him a very clear warning was sent out to European and North American factions “intent on a radical global depopulation plan through a contrived war on terror, artificially created pandemics, and environmental disasters produced through advanced eco- weapons.”

Have you seen those crowded, late-60s/early-70s, paperback-original, James-Bond-wannabe covers (usually rather badly drawn)? You know, the ones with some smug after-shave-ad guy in wraparound sunglasses leaning on his sports car with his arms crossed but with a silencer-equipped pistol in one hand, and an overvoluptuous girl in a bikini somewhere, and a variety of weapons scattered about, and a rocket launch in the background, and maybe a little fistfight off to one side and a passionate embrace off to the other, and usually at least one more unlikely item--typically a palm tree or a Chinese dragon or a prowling lion--to suggest the setting?

The stories in this collection were not written in the order in which they appear here; they certainly were not conceived as part of a continuous narrative. However, I have decided to bring them together because of the chronology and themes which, it turns out, run through them. Please bear in mind that this is in no way a novella or novelette. It is a collection of short stories, and each story stands or falls on its own, as short stories must.

Back to earth with a bump after our flirtation with the paps and celebrity lifestyle (albeit double F grade), we supplied some manual labour and helped out on the village common, just tidying up really. This year though we benefited from a huge tree that needed to come down. There is still some two thirds to collect from the common land but the photos show the new wood in the store, then turning round towards the garage you see some more queueing up to go in. When it's all collected hopefully we'll be full to the brim.

It is not just the price, which is a problem at every level right now in my opinion as players are simply paid too much for whichever league they play in, but also a general sense of frustration with the game at the upper end of the pyramid that has led me to seek my football pleasures away from my own club.
And it does feel hot the moment my eyes, having trawled over the landscape seeking typical rural signposts of carts, cattle, homesteads, and farmhands, withdraw for respite from finding none or too few and far between in the miles that abound.

Stanley had always wanted to follow in his footsteps. A.J. built him his own miniature theatre in the attic when he was nine. When Stan was at boarding school, one of his teachers would wake him up after all the kids were asleep and have him entertain the faculty. Stanley Jefferson was a terrible student but that was overlooked on account of his talent. One day, when he was in his teens, he snuck off to a music hall run by a friend of A.J.’s and quietly, anxiously made his theatrical debut. A.J. approved. He got Stan a job with Levy and Cardwell’s Juvenile Pantomimes, with whom the boy performed for two years.

- Organised. The Christmas tree place just a 5 minute drive from us was crazy busy on Saturday, we'd thought to grab lunch there, no chance. Got a good tree though, after walking through driving snow in sub zero temperatures to the far end of the field as we dismissed tree after tree as being 'too tall', 'too wonky', 'too dead', 'too small' and so on. Fortunately, pine is nice and soft and a tree just over 6ft tall doesn't have too thick a trunk so it didn't take Si too long to saw through it.

It’s been pretty devastating, especially on my mom. This dog arrived while my grandmother was dying in Arizona, and my mom no longer had anyone to take care of. She filled many voids for us all, but especially mom. She followed mom around like a, well, puppy dog. She loved people. She’d sprint down the pier and leap into the lake. She loved toys. And she even barked away a bear at our front door.

“At any rate, I was determined to keep my feet on the ground, in every sense. If I’d ever had any youthful notions about flitting off for a while, which I really never did, once I was through with the fever and delirium and had made peace with the whole painful, wasteful process — if I had ever thought of flying, once I was married, once we had a child, nothing, nothing could induce me to yearn for even a taste of that life, to consider it even for a moment. The utter irresponsibility of it, the arrogance — the arrogance of it is very distasteful to me.”

“This primal, irrational fear is evoked in the gigantic threatening spiders in J. R.R Tolkien’s Return of the King and J. K Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Shelob, the female spider in the Tolkien book, particularly evokes some kind of terrible, primal, chthonic goddess. Her hunger and ferocity transform her into a veritable guardian spirit, albeit not for Frodo.” p 94 (The Element Encyclopedia of Witchcraft)
Unfortunately, skipping meals is a sure way to make it even harder to lose weight. Not only do we need to consume a minimum of 1200 – 1400 Calories per day, we also need to eat regularly. Fewer calories or too long between meals and our body goes into what they call “starvation mode”.
Helen opens the door to the baby's room, and finds Anne Marie in there. She chases Helen into the kitchen and pushes her to the floor. Anne Marie starts bashing Helen's head into the floor, so Helen fights back, until she manages to straddle the other woman. Grabbing the bloody meat cleaver off the floor, Helen holds it above her head...until a small army of cops arrive on the scene, to corner and arrest Helen.

Pennsylvania’s official celebration of Groundhog Day began on February 2nd, 1886 with a proclamation in The Punxsutawney Spiritby the newspaper’s editor, Clymer Freas: “Today is groundhog day and up to the time of going to press the beast has not seen its shadow.” The groundhog was given the name “Punxsutawney Phil, Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Prognosticator of Prognosticators, and Weather Prophet Extraordinary” and his hometown thus called the “Weather Capital of the World.” His debut performance: no shadow – early Spring.
As she approaches chemo and after that, surgery, there are a lot of things that will be changing. The beautiful hair (which has gotten curlier over the years, actually) will likely fall out.

Second, according to the article this is not a done deal. The Federal political class is proving again that they cannot agree to do anything worthwhile. Congressional people are divided along industry lines, with some politicians trying to make the change to a dollar coin in support of mining and steelworker interests and other politicians supporting ink and paper interests.
That is a goddamn cartoon cage. How are we meant to take this seriously? I couldn’t, and the attempts at making her sympathetic just came across as absurd instead. There are far better ways they could have done something similar, but no, they went with the ridiculous ones. And they just take it so far – at one point third-world-Yuno is forced to eat some of the mat under the cage or something because she was left for that long. It was not presented in a manner which felt naturalistic. Just an over the top attempt at making her seem pitiful. Well at least they didn’t have her parents sexually abuse her or anything. Speaking of though…
Then there are so much of excited allegations about his wife too. Somehow the commoner on the street cannot help mentioning about the Brikins bags and the diamond ring; and within the corporate corridors we hear of lunch-hour gossips about her expensive holidays and buying sprees including a credit-card story in Indonesia.

When the British started colonizing the Falklands in 1833, they were in direct violation of U.S. Foreign Policy, under the Monroe Doctrine. At that time, Monroe would have sided with the Argentines and against the British, and if he were alive in 1982 or today, he would take the same anti-colonial stand.

Jillian incorporates cardio a little bit in that the workouts are at a decent pace so you can maximize the amount of calories you are burning. All but one of the circuits utilize hand-weights, but you do not need to use anything more than three-pound ones. The reason is because Jillian emphasizes repetition to get the results you want, rather than less movement with heavier lifting.
So after collapsing and crating the stand after the shows closure at 15:00, we made our way back to our nearby hotel in the early evening to collect our stored luggage, we booked our taxi and waited in the lobby for our driver to turn up. Mustafa our taxi driver had a fantastic sense of humour and was only about 15 minutes away from our hotel when we rang for him, having already taken half of our crew to the airport, as they had earlier flights to differing destinations.

It doesn’t matter whose fault it is. The fault clearly lies with the people who would harass, threaten and stalk a young girl. But the fact of the matter is, their actions have become her reality…a reality that she had the power to walk away from at any point. Now that Kiki is 18, it is up to her to make that decision or not. But when she was 13, when she was 15, when she was 17, it was up to her parents. As guardians, we must protect our children. It’s not our fault when things go wrong. That has nothing to do with the fact that things sometimes do go wrong and it is our responsibility above all else, beyond the blame game, to protect our children. If we don’t, many times, no one will.

As I walked around the room, I couldn’t enjoy myself anymore. What I found around the room was an outstandingly huge amount of wasted food. Hundreds of plates stacked in the dirty-plate tray, filled with huge chunks of premium-quality ribs, discarded cakes, and sometimes an amount which doesn’t fit the term “leftover” anymore, like a whole plate of pasta still untouched. Heck, you can even feed a whole orphanage for days with all those food.
What I suggest is Love. Love for everyone, every body type. It is DNA and choices that make up a body type and hatred of any type is prejudice an ill hearted. I will encourage you to do something for me, for yourself and the world our children will inhabit. I encourage you to tell someone the opposite body type as you that they are beautiful. Allow this love to protrude from you like a shining light.
I started crying, because all of our friends had collectively agreed together: "Showers and coming inside for a glass of water -- those are ok. Giving him a place to crash is not." It was shortly before we started using the word "enabling" in every other conversation regarding this friend.

In my own smaller version, I sort of tried to create a faux self that I sold to everyone including my family as being the real me. The first time I felt the relief of even for a short time admitting I didn't know what I was doing and didn't know how to make it look like I did any longer was when I was 27 and had drank a lethal amount of alcohol and took the only pills in my apartment, which were cold tablets I had to pop out of the plastic safety bubbles and his ginseng capsules. The combo is funny in hindsight, but what I was trying to say wasn't that I wanted to die necessarily but I just wanted help.

…80 percent of divorces are unilateral. Under “no-fault,” divorce becomes a power grab by one spouse, assisted by judicial officials who profit from the ensuing litigation: judges, lawyers, psychotherapists, and social workers. Involuntary divorce involves government agents forcibly removing innocent people from their homes, seizing their property, and separating them from their children. It requires long-term supervision over private life by state functionaries, including police and jails.

The key is found in his description as ardens et lucens, ardent and illuminating. He appealed to both the mind, and to the heart.

And to care for her in ways that the evil step-mother cliché banns the family from doing.

"initial obligations" of ISPs under sections 124A and 124B are conditional on there being a code in force under section 124C or 124D. The word "if" in section 124A(2) is important, even though the provisions contemplate that there must in due course be a code: until such time as the Code comes into being, the provisions impose no obligations on ISPs. Moreover the Code is to be made for the purpose of regulating the initial obligations, and the scope of those obligations will be dependent on the detailed content of the Code. Whilst the statute prescribes various basic features of the Code, it leaves very considerable freedom for the working out of the detail."
Pouring it out it had a fresh citrusy smell with a woody slightly microbrewed craft ale taste to it but without the gag reflex associated with micro brewed ale. This was followed by a more conventional lagered hop dryness. The dry bitterness rounded itself off nicely on the aftertaste into a nice little tongue tingle. Kinda good. I necked it quickly and finished with a satisfying belch. Decent lout.

Then I realize, I wouldn't be happy doing that. I can't sit and be emotional and spiritual in front of my children. I have to be matter of fact, open and honest but matter of fact. Logical and straight from the hip. I also want my me time, which, I guess, for me, is to spend some time on the computer web surfing. I surf for information, often reading news articles and Wikipedia, for questions that come up. I relax by watching goofy SyFy shows and just letting my brain turn to mush. I don't want to spend every waking minute with my kids, I want them to find ways to entertain themselves. Maybe they need to see me doing more reading, like when I lost an hour just reading about Maui and suddenly realized I should shower and work on lunch.

LICENSE TO KILL addressed fears that James Bond was ready to be put out to pasture by jamming him into a period-piece revenge flick. GOLDENEYE addresses the same concern head-on. The verbal sparring session between Bond and M quoted above is played brilliantly by Judi Dench and Pierce Brosnan, and it clearly lays out their positions – we have the older woman with the new age ideals on espionage versus the younger man with the previous age’s belief system. She doesn’t like him because he’s a reminder of what used to be and he doesn’t like her because she’s a reminder of what’s coming. The exchange nicely sets up who James Bond is in terms of the picture we’re watching.

Since the guest room is nearly complete (pictures and a breakdown of what we did to come later this week!), my mind has already moved on to visions of mr p's room. I just love the the endless possibilities decorating children's rooms provides.

That is exactly what I am going to try to achieve for mr p's room - playful and clean (wait, can those things and a five year old really go together??).

Scaring the hell out of your children is not necessary, and it should be considered a violation of a child's rights as a human. There is no other situation in which it would be acceptable to lock a person in a dark room against her will. Why are parents allowed to do things like this to their children?

5. Pick the right aircraft for your flight. If you want to fly non-stop, consider a large-cabin heavy jet. For flights from the East Coast, the Gulfstream G-IV series is the smallest heavy jet that flies nonstop to and from Europe in either direction; other options include the Bombardier Challenger 600 series or the Dassault Falcon 2000 series. All of these jets can typically fly from the northeast United States to most destinations in Western Europe nonstop. However, for the return flight to the United States, these aircraft will likely require a fuel stop.

My kitchen is decorated in red. So when I saw these towels and dish clothes they had to come home with me. I have seen microfiber towels but the only colors I have seen them in were neon colors or white. I love the design on these towels. I plan to display them in a basket on my counter top.

9. In quotations from the Wisdom of Solomon I have used the English translation by Samuel Holmes in R.H. Charles, ed., The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament in English, with Introductions and Critical and Explanatory Notes, vol. 1 (Oxford, 1913), pp. 518-568. In his introduction to the book, Holmes compares the author’s personification of Wisdom to the personification of the Word (Logos) in Philo, and observes that in Philo “The Logos is not unbegotten as God … On the other hand it is not begotten as man … We shall perhaps not be far wrong if we attribute the same idea to our author with regard to the personality of Wisdom.” (p. 528) And the obvious parallels here with John’s statements about the Son are too close to be ignored.

Some of the things I enjoyed about the film include its visuals. For the most part, the inhabitants of the world are gritty and dirty and having thick bears or in need of a shave. This dark outlook paints the setting in ways that modern television often fails to. Few people look perfect, few people look like the actors they are. Instead they look like they could all use a bath and a good meal.

As of today, Korean politics can be divided largely into two camps: conservatives and progressives. Broadly speaking, Korea's conservatives and progressives generally follow the same direction as the rightist and leftist politics of the United States or Europe. But there are peculiar aspects in Korean politics, owing to Korea's history, that drive Korea's conservatives and progressives into unexpected directions. Thus, to understand Korea's political landscape, one must first understand modern Korean history.
When I ask this question, I’m not just talking about whether you believe in a biblical God or a big bang, or a whole series of cosmic explosions. I’m talking about a different kind of knowing — a direct, experi ential recognition of what occurred in that moment 14 billion years ago. You don’t need a powerful telescope to see all the way back to the big bang — you can go there, right now, in your very own experience.

That last shot of the bell ringing rather famously dissolves into a match shot of Sophia's hoop skirt as she rides a swing toward camera. The film is filled with this sort of mordant wit, although there's nothing else that rhymes quite like that. There is a recurring visual motif, though, and it's found in the shot of the doll: something unexpectedly terrible emerging from its hiding place. You can see the same thing in a later shot of an obscene cuckoo clock, or this memorable image of a drill bit slowly making its way through the eye of an icon.
Since I’m a self-proclaimed “self-help junkie,” it’s no surprise to anyone that I have a book on body language. I picked it up last summer and thumbed through it on our holidays.
I want to reiterate that, despite points 2 and 3 above, I certainly recognize the centrality of the virgin birth to the story we as Christians tell today. Regardless of its relative importance to Paul or Mark, it’s important to us. I’ll probably also look on why that is and whether it should be, but the reality is still the same, and I approach this understanding that fact, which is to say I approach this sincerely and seriously, not casually or flippantly.

A thought provoking book. I would imagine it would be hard to be angry at a comatose-dying spouse, even for infidelity. This was what was going through Matt's mind. So what did he do? He loved and respected his wife, Joanie, enough to seek out her lover figuring that would be what she wanted. Then off he goes with his unruly daughters to bring the man to Joanie. Finds out that the lover had a riding on Matt's decision to sell his incredibly huge inherited land and something more personal. This, along with the adventure of having to personally invite Joanie's close friends to visit her to say their goodbyes and prepare to be a single parent was quite a feat for Matt.

Of course, choosing fund allocation in our community is always a difficult decision when there are so many worthy projects needing to be considered. If we look down the road to see which of these projects will have lasting value for our community, we believe that a new library is one such project that will bring our town in line with the future. Voting for the new library will be held May 15, but if you are unable to do so then, you may vote at the courthouse from now through May 11.
Pronounced ‘WHO-Garden,’ this Belgian White Ale can be consumed quickly – chugged. Pierre Celis, famous for brewing the first batch of Hoegaarden beer in 1966 in Belgium, founded the Celis Brewery in Austin Texas, which was bought out by Miller in 2001.
The eagle-eyed among you will see the boo-boo I've made! When I showed this card to my hubby, he said "it's great ... but he should have socks on not bare legs!" - Oops!! Apologies to all the baseball fans out there! You'll just have to imagine that Oliver is playing baseball with his friends at the local park rather than being kitted out in full uniform, lol! ;)
Criticising people and groups advocating abolition of death penalty, he said: “It may be added some groups have been advocating abolition of the capital punishment. It seems that the persons leading these groups are living in ivory towers and have never been touched by such crimes committed on the ordinary citizens. The victim is not there to tell the agony of pain he or she suffers. In the present case, there is no other alternative but to award the above proposed punishment”.
I first started participating in sprinting during NaNoWriMo last year. There's a place on Facebook for members of one of my writing groups where we can go to sprint. I know of writers who also did sprints on Twitter. I finally wandered over to the iWriteNetwork sprints in the chat room where I found the interaction to be more immediate than on Facebook and less cumbersome than on Twitter where you had to use a hashtag with every comment. If you haven't participated in a sprint session before, I suggest you give one a try and see how you like it.

The bombshell came at the most inopportune time.
a plot, a scheme, a mystery?
Either way. It was a kick in the heart in the midst of car shopping with BFF2 (the Mazda was the winner, I was all over that shit). Then Mother decided to call when I was battling the mall and wanted me to tell her what was wrong with her computer that is across the other side of the country. And now I have a friend flying in from Melbourne who… Fuck it. I’m not going to whinge and complain because it is completely pointless.
The downside for passengers travelling to New York though, will be that the service will be disabled 250 miles from US airspace due to American laws. It will also be unavailable during take offs and landings.

I didn't notice anyone else having a fag.
OCCUPATIONS – Forty-nine differing occupations were listed in the census, which were discreet in terms of gender. Appendix 2 breaks down these occupations according to gender, and shows the occupation shared by men and women. Predominately women and men did not share the same occupations, and therefore workers were in gender-specific groups or communities of practice. Women were boilers and drivers, but they were not masons, carpenters or stock minders these occupations were the preserve of the men, but they were the seamstress, preserve maker and overseers cook.

The ‘Raise a Glass’ campaign is driven by Foster’s major brand, Victoria Bitter, in conjunction with Legacy and the RSL. The first thing that struck me is that the whole VB branding is almost invisible, set into the site as a subtle understatement rather than a fan-faring ‘look at me, look at me!!’ kind of grandstanding. The purpose of the promotion (apart from shifting units) is to remember and honour those who have served in military conflicts around the world over the past century.

The calamari we “guaranteed tender”, which seems like a lofty claim. But it was true! There’s nothing worse than tough calamari, and this was yummy. We cooked it on the griddle for only a few minutes, and it was very good. Hubby loves calamari – it’s his absolute favourite – so expectations were high! And M&S delivered.
Take the second strip and start folding it in and wrapping it around itself until you end up with a ball shape. Pin this to the top of the cone and manipulate as desired. I wanted mine to look a little sloppy. If you want a super neat little circle then you could just sew a small pouch and fill it with batting rather than using a gathered strip.

There is something called the Triad Sleep Pattern that occurs for many: you sleep for about 2-3 hours, wake up, go back to sleep for another couple of hours, wake again, and go back to sleep again. For others, the sleeprequirements have changed. You can get by on less sleep.

This film is long for its genre, but not detrimentally so; if you are familiar with the Apatow school of comedy, you should be expecting a two-hour-plus film, and ENGAGEMENT delivers that. But it serves a purpose, allowing Stoller to achieve something that few other comedy filmmakers (with the possible exception of the other comedians in Apatow’s camp) manage to: an aggressive search for truth. Whereas the quality of the majority of other comedies depends largely on how many jokes they can stuff into a scene, Stoller takes things a step further. Don’t get me wrong – there are jokes to be found here, and plenty of them, but the film isn’t content with settling for them.

Wilson is more discreet and far more dangerous, Mulcahy said. ”Ed is devious and cunning and he’s living a lie -that he is the most important human being alive. He’ll use anything to manipulate people or events to get them to come out in his favor. He’s absolutely brilliant in the way he sets a deal up, puts people together and parcels out information. Ed compartmentalizes his own operation the same way the agency does. It allows him to play both ends against the middle and come out the winner. If Ed comes back and goes on trial, he’s going to use every bit of information he’s stored up for years to get the C.I.A. in court and put the agency on trial instead of Ed Wilson.” In fact, Wilson’s attorney in Washington, Seymour Glanzer, has repeatedly told Federal prosecutors that the whole story of his client’s involvement in Libya has not been aired. Glanzer, in a telephone interview, refused to comment. But the prosecutors have inferred from conversations with him that his defense will be: Wilson is still at work for the C.I.A. There is no known evidence that this is the case, however.
Under his leadership, the UMass Marching Band – known as the Power and Class of New England – won the nation’s top marching band honor in 1998 and was called one of the best bands in the country again in 2008. It was one of only 13 college bands to receive the Sudler Trophy from the John Phillip Sousa Foundation, and played during presidential inaugurations in 1981, 1985, and 2001. Parks led the honor band in the Tournament of Roses Parade in 2004 and 2008, and was enshrined in the Bands of America Hall of Fame in 2004. He taught camps, was an accomplished music educator and a gifted teacher –but in the end, he was just about the music.
He visits Iris in the secluded cabin where they had planned their honeymoon, but when he arrives she is being menaced by a giant bear. He tries to save her without using his super-speed, but is kayoed by the grizzly. Fortunately, it turns out that the bear is a retired circus performer. However, Iris is not thrilled at Barry's effort, and indeed, compares him unfavorably to the Flash. Barry returns to Central City, where his uniform, discovered by a passing hitchhiker, is on display at the Flash Museum:

I am responsible for budgeting in my home. I’ve always been able to stretch dollars to cover everything that was necessary. For the last four years, we have lived off one income virtually all the time. It was about this time in 2008 when I was ordered to cease working due to a very difficult pregnancy that resulted in the delivery of our youngest, and last child, at 24-weeks in gestation. Since that time, we have had to have one parent home with him at all times. That parent has mostly been me.

But, NO....I decide to try to make jeans. Now, mind you, I'm sure, somewhere in my past history, I have actually purchased a pair of jeans that fit. Especially in these days of spandex and shape-sizing and a zillion different options for jeans.

The space is quite large and plans include a music/performance area with a stage and space for art exhibits. It also has a small backyard and a fully functioning kitchen. The former owner of the original Freddy's is out of the picture and the new Freddy's is a joint partnership between Donald O'Finn, Matt Khun and Matt Kimmett, the two former being previous Freddy’s bartenders.
Convenient crises -- the Panic of 1906; World War I; the Great Depression -- played a part in this progression, beyond all question. But the ideas had to be "waiting in the wings," already well established in a sufficient number of Americans' minds and favorable to the ambitions of energetic, opportunistic men, to exploit them. That idea-foundation provided just enough habitat for the earliest acolytes of the Omnipotent State to flourish and expand.

Ragen Chastain’s blog today addresses an issue I already talked about, but she went much further with the subject than I did, though I did, indeed, write the White House. Maybe you can, too. Maybe we can bust through the barrier here if we all write? I think this is probably pretty important.
The same talk can be a different experience in different places because there may be differences in your presentation style, your energy level (perhaps related to whether cookies and coffee were served just before the talk), and/or time of day (or day of week or month of year etc.). However, the experience is also greatly affected by whether the talk was on a topic and at a level that was appreciated by a significant number of people in the audience. I mostly use the number and type of questions during or after my talk as a guide to whether the audience is interested and if my talk is making any sense at all. I haven't found the facial expressions of the audience during a talk to be a very useful guide. And I am not offended when some people fall asleep, as long as most people are awake.
And sometimes I see her like it is the first time. I forgot how gorgeous and miraculous and special she is. Then I catch a glimpse of her with the sun in her eyes, a goofy expression on her face, just being sooo her and I remember. I remember that it is not the messes, the whining, the tantrums, the refusing to nap, the being into everything all day. Those are just actions they are not her. She is so much more, she can make anything tolerable.

My in-laws, Fillis and John, met while living in Paris on their junior year abroad, and celebrated their 40th anniversary in January. That's the official reason for taking the trip when we did, but the truth is that Marc has been talking about talking a trip there with his parents for as long as I can remember. They are true Paris veterans who really know the city well and can speak fluently, so we knew they would be excellent tour guides. Fillis and John were very generous and provided our flights and hotel room, and we're very thankful for that. But they were also wonderful travel companions, and we had a great time exploring the city together.

The show illustrates a period at a very interesting time of agricultural history.

In my experience, Christian rock is banal, predictable, completely lacking in poetry, and, frankly, “calculated,” to echo Johnson’s apt descriptor. For that reason, this essay failed to engage me.

If you search on “Bible” in the Apple App Store, you will get 942 iPad apps and another 2466 for the iPhone! This is a bit overwhelming, so I will try to narrow the field a bit and comment on some of the apps I have used. In part one I will focus on Readers, in part two I will focus on “other” apps which might be useful for biblical studies.

As the invoker started backing away towards home, and the thief started eyeing the window ledge above, Torrin the dragonborne calmed everyone down and said he had a plan. With a huff and a puff and a prodigious blast of dragon fire, he blew the door down. Thank Bahamut he didn’t roll a 1 on that attack door! He was attacking the broad side of a barn, that is true, but I was not pulling any punches with the critical failures. He blew a dragonborne sized hole in the door, the edges still smoldering, and heard the spectral yelp of another two headed dusk beast, whose fur was singed by the fiery blast.

Getting to know your professors can not only lead to job recommendations, but can also be a gateway to important introductions and meaningful support systems. Maintaining relationships with Carolina alumni is also an important step in preserving resources of encouragement and possible job connections. I only really took advantage of University Career Services in my senior year, and that’s something I should have done much sooner. Through UCS, you can find jobs posted by alumni or by organizations where alumni are already employed and find employers looking for Carolina grads.

Thomas cried out, Jn 20:28. “My Lord and my God.” It was not, “You are the Lord, the Ruler of the Universe.” Nor was it, “You are the God, the maker of the world and of all mankind.” Rather he cried out, “You are MY Lord. You are MY God.” He was submitting himself to Christ as his personal Lord and Maker. It was more than believing the fact that Jesus had risen from the dead. There is a massive difference between “believing about” and “trusting in”.

Our world is more complex than it was when I was growing up. Bullies need to be stopped and we must protect our kids from many more evils than ever before. But the basics are still there and we need to remember them as the adults in the community. Kids are worth the time it takes to set up the expectation, give them the choice and allow their character to grow. The adults they become will thank us, as will the community in which they live.
The main course was grilled veal (oh, stop!) with tiny perfect mushrooms and roasted red onions in some sort of tangy reduction. I'm unable to describe the taste, it was again so familiar and so different. It made me wish I was wearing tweed, sitting in a lodge with antlers on the walls. It made me want to smoke a pipe.

“Why novels and plays are so often untrue to life is because their authors, perhaps of necessity, make their characters all of a piece. They cannot afford to make them self-contradictory, for then they become incomprehensible, and yet self-contradictory is what most of us are. We are a haphazard bundle of inconsistent qualities. In books on logic they will tell you that it is absurd to say that yellow is tubular or gratitude heavier than air; but in the mixture of incongruities that makes up the self yellow may very well be a horse and cart and gratitude the middle of next week.”

While interviewing her, she talked about the Brooklyn Children’s Museum. She said they were about to close the museum in the neighborhood. Some people (herself included) didn’t want to close the museum so they protested the closing to keep the museum open. Their wish came true and the museum still stands in Crown Heights on 145 Brooklyn Avenue. The Brooklyn Children's Museum was founded in 1899. It used to be in two large mansions. It was the first museum created just for kids in the United States. Its success inspired the creation of similar museums in other places.

Then pass your hand from left to right over the food and bless it. You may notice that the food feels warm to your hand even if the food is cold– I like to think that the food is good for me when it feels warm and nourishing to my hand. I have also noticed that when I practice blessing the food, I don’t eat as much. It is important not to let yourself off the hook when you forget to bless the food before you eat.
If you follow me on Facebook, you may have already seen my good news, but if not, I'm so excited to be sharing it today. Wednesday, at 11:22 am, I joyfully accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at a major university in Chicago. The past few months have been filled with anxiety and stress, completing applications and inteviewing across the Chicagoland area. Back in December, I made the decision that no matter what, after the completion of my internship in July, I was going to return to Chicago. Job or not, I was coming back to be with Matt, to be a family, to continue our "normal" life together, living in the same city, and seeing each other every day. So with my sites set on Chicago, I worked my butt off to get as many interviews as possible, in a market that is pretty saturated with professionals in my field. Monday I had an all day interview at my top site. And though I loved the site, I came home fairly certain I hadn't done well in the interview. I replayed my answers over and over in my head, criticizing each turn and gesture, all the while having Matt and my family tell me, "Allison, I'm sure you were wonderful." As I waited for Wednesday morning's notification time, I kept praying for God to calm my anxiety, to remind me that He had a plan already in place. And at 11:22, that plan was revealed.

The second beer of the night comes from Hyoko Yashiki no Mori Brewery, or Swan Lake Beers. At a full 10% this promises to be no slouch! This beer does pour pitch black, with a dark tan head which quickly dissipates. The beer is much more bitter chocolate, but also in the aroma there's a huge amount of vanilla and charred oak character amongst a bitter vegetal (ashen corn) character. The bottle states; '12. 06. 07.' on the bottle, I'm now wondering if that's a bottled on date or a best before date - either way I'm pretty happy! This is a thick and very rich beer. An obvious alcohol bitterness is the first obvious sign of a big beer but that then melts away to make way for caramel malt sweetness and a lactic creaminess which begs the mouth for more. It reminds me a lot of drinking some Danish Imperial Stouts from keg in North Bar for some reason... It's a perfect Imperial Stout - it hits all the right notes and does not leave you wanting. My only regret is that it's probably the only time I'm ever going to drink this beer.
Do we stop at Sunday services? Are we content with a particular standard of behavior? Is it enough that a newly “saved” person is at every available service and regularly reads a religious text? Do we see that now they know lots of new songs they only sing on Sunday and lots of new Bible stories that don’t make sense to their secular world-mates and say, Hey! We succeeded! We got another one!

147. To Kill a Mockingbird: Harper Lee
The Chafetz Chaim wrote Ahavat Chesed when he was close to fifty years old and already well regarded in the Torah world. Normally authors much younger and relatively unknown will gather approbations for their work. Yet the Chafetz Chaim solicited haskamot for Ahavat Chesed, including one by the noted Torah scholar, the Netziv, which will be discussed here. The Netziv had his own angle on chesed that fits perfectly with the approach developed in Ahavat Chesed. The Chafetz Chaim had two themes in mind when he wrote his work. First, to teach us the technical details of the mitzva including what is prohibited and permitted. Second, to emphasize that chesed is not just a thoughtful act but an actual mitzvat asei in the Torah. These two points are interconnected, because the fact that chesed is a mitzva, impacts the details of the halachot.

I could simply turn off the verification and allow Blogger's spam detection to filter out the bad stuff. I'm not very impressed by what I've seen of this technology so far. A couple of weeks ago, they quarantined Hermione's brunch response, and there are some readers who seem to be systematically filtered for some reason. On the flip side, some very spammy comments still get through. If I choose this option, there will be a lot of housekeeping. Again, I value your opinions.

Well I believe copywriters have their own dance class. It’s called “poetry.” Much to the never-ending disappointment of my parents, I took several poetry classes in college. They all emphasized the same core concepts: artistic use of image, precise word choice, and economy of language. And when you think about the writing you see in business, what comes up every time? Images, word choice, and language.

Things got interesting for me this morning when I woke up at around 10 AM. I realized I hadn’t been putting my name out there for potential jobs. It’s a hell of a thing to wake up to, especially with the change of season upon us all. There are goals to meet. There at so many things to do. There’s all that damned Spring Cleaning I’ve been putting off (mostly because it seems other people have left ME in charge of it for the whole family).
Such a nice lady.
Why then do we not see a manifestation of this in the life of many believers? What accounts for this disconnect is the absence or presence of the glory of God! if the glory of God is present in your life, the empowered inner man, created in the likeness of God that is buried in you will spring forth and you will occupy your place of dominion. But if the glory of God is absent, you will live a defeated life like any ordinary man and die like them. Some people will do virtually anything to occupy a political, secular or ecclesiastical position whereas the real position they should strive to occupy – as a god of this world is hardly even considered. But that is where the real power is.
Reading is a favorite pastime of mine. The operative word there being “past”. I spend my time reading the bills, the occasional blog from my reader and creatively illustrated children’s books each night at bedtime. I used to be a voracious bibliofile before children. I could literally clear the shelves at the library and tested the weight limit of my nightstand with the always present tower-of-books. A few months ago, I was contacted about reviewing a book on beekeeping. I have also found two slow-cooker cookbooks that I rely on for dinnertime meals that start in the morn before the girls wake up. And, then there is the novel that captured my heart enough to move it from the “borrowed” to “for keeps” status.

To hang it up, I cut strips of Offray ribbon and pearls in various lengths and colors. I threaded one ribbon through the banner holes, then twisted the rest of the ribbons together around main ribbon to make it more "froofy" LOL.

A few weeks ago I worked with photographer David Zickl on a project for Phoenix Magazine; we had been hoping that our photo might make the cover, and I'm pleased to say that today I found out it did! David had been given an assignment to shoot one of the winners of the magazine's "Best Of" awards, and since he'd been given the winner of Best Tailor (Scottsdale's Fifth Avenue Alterations) he had the idea to style a model like Charlie Chaplin for the shoot. I'd actually worked with David a couple of years ago, when he photographed MacAlpine's Soda Fountain for an issue of Arizona Highways, and he contacted me to see if I was up to his latest challenge. Of course I said yes, and after being outfitted in proper Chaplin attire by Matilda's Closet, we shot our glamorous take on "The Little Tramp".

Many bigots, opportunists and self-serving leaders in UMNO prefer to ignore the fact that there are also many deprived people from among the minorities who need help in many ways. Unity does not mean that UMNO and their BN parties should come together to help themselves with the nation’s wealth, with UMNO taking the biggest share. Racial unity also becomes a mockery if all opportunities are given to a single race with crumbs thrown to the minorities. Practising tokenism for the minorities will only demoralize the marginalized more.
Online copyright infringement remains rampant and a significant threat to the growing legal business models providing consumers with access to music, film and other content online. The major film and music studios have shown willingness to enforce their rights in the courts, but many of their victories have been hollow: the infringers just pop up again with a different name, in a different form or in a jurisdiction in which enforcement is difficult. Rightsholders have therefore changed tack, seeking to force internet service providers to prevent their subscribers from accessing the infringing services in the first place.

No matter how many laws the treacherous governments of this land may have written they can not change nature. An Englishman does not become Chinese by being born in Beijing and a Somali does not become British by being born in Telford. Location does not change genes, and to claim otherwise is all part of the fantasy world created by political correctness, where, to take it to its logical conclusion to become a horse, a sheep need only to be born in a stable.

I am feeling the need to purge stuff. Our garage is over run with toys, some good and some not, plus outgrown clothes (though we are using them) but it's time to get rid of the baby stuff that K has outgrown. The inside of the house needs to be purged, closets cleaned, clutter gone. I guess the Spring cleaning bug has hit me early. We got all the Christmas stuff down and put up yesterday, I am glad to have my living room back.
On a cheerier note, and another reason for not blogging - my pc finally started sounding its death knell with much grinding, snorting and coughing. For a hopeful moment I thought it might be hatching a dragon. No such luck. But I now have a new pc, custom built, super fast, frighteningly silent and super powerful. Cool. It means I can finish the book trailer I started making – it was looking quite good before everything crashed…
As to the title of the post?

I’m sure we all agree that eyes that see, ears that hear and teeth that chew sure make life easier, not to mention more pleasant. My husband and I live inAlaska, but spend about four months during the winter inCalifornianear our daughter. I realized the day before we left, that one of my hearing aids had quit working. Fully aware of the possibility that Costco would not be able to fix it that fast, I called them and explained my situation to the repair man. He said that if I could get there by 4:00 the next day, he would see what he could do.
The shortcakes themselves—a sweet variation on a classic biscuit—are easy enough to make. Some shortcake recipes call for a variety of dairy products to bind the dry ingredients together, producing a base that could range from flaky-layered biscuits to tender-crumbed scones, and I’ve even seen recipes that incorporate finely chopped hard-boiled egg yolks into the mixture. But this recipe plays it clean and straight, requiring only chilled butter and some cream to transform ordinary flour, sugar and baking powder into extraordinary little shortcakes.

One important difference between the development of medicine in China and in the West is the greater interest in the West in surgical procedures and techniques.

Don’t know about you, but I don’t consciously remember all 26,000 experiences but they are still part of me and the beliefs that were formed through them get tucked away in my heart somewhere and become “secrets” (some true, some false) that drive me on a daily basis until I am willing to truly listen to what my heart has to tell me about what I believe on a “gut” level and why I believe it.

The radio reports said that they had about half an acre in flashy fuel with a strong wind giving it a moderate to rapid rate of spread. The first-in engine claimed it, named it and opted to attack the head. According to a friend of mine who happened to be on that engine said that they really had to get on it, as the head was moving pretty quick. Fortunately, their efforts paid off and they caught it right away. Unfortunately for me, they also ruined any opportunity for good photos. As I was already there, I chose to take a few photos of mop-up operations. Some times you just have to take what you can get.

Rewind, You get up this morning, you don’t feel well. Money is tight, you haven’t slept well for several nights, your boss has been very demanding lately and your dog is sick. You stop, take a deep breath and remind yourself how much you love your husband.You give him an extra hug and kiss and tell him how much you love him. Your husband takes danishes for the office staff. His secretary didn’t have breakfast so the danish is a treat. At lunch she’s feeling so good, she doubles the tip she normally leaves for the waitress. The waitress is able to make her car payment. She decides to take an extra shift every week at the diner. Business improves and the diner hires the secretary’s firm for advertising. So your husband lands a big account and money is not so tight.

There is no such thing as ‘a’ novel. Or poem. Or story or… as a single, aesthetically (or otherwise) coherent, systematically organized structure or system, such that every part relates to every other to create a unified, and unifying whole. And it is this, not because there are as many readings as readers, or because every possible interpretive translation (all interpretations are translations) is necessarily limited, that we can never comprehend a literary production as a whole—as convincing and these arguments might be—but because there is no such thing. It does not exist. That is not to say, Joyce’s Ulysses doesn’t exist. It does. In different versions, and each version is made of parts that are always greater than any hypothetical, always inconceivable whole. I say ‘inconceivable,’ not that we can’t conceive of the possibility of an aesthetic whole—but that it will be impossible to point to what that might actually be. Sort of like the way we talk about God. Imaginable in general, but inconceivable in the particular. Or for that matter, how we think of collectives of power… of the State…which has more than a little in common with the way we think of God. ---

I had the luck to be reading Harry Potter while I was in college and being assigned to read all the classics at the same time. I could see how Harry Potter connects the history of literature and mythical classics to an entirely new generation of readers. At the same time, in the middle of my fanatical Harry Potter phase, I happened upon a book by John Granger (The Hidden Key to Harry Potter), that made some very interesting points. While many people were arguing that Harry Potter was trying to teach children witchcraft, Mr. Granger (no relation to Hermione) argued that Harry Potter was the opposite, and in fact relating similar Christian beliefs and themes as the touted works of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.

But now I am tired. So tired. Like I used up all my energy being normal. I was trying to help kiddo with homework last night, and the words made no sense. I laid down and went to that level 1 sleep, where I can hear kids, but I’m unable to wake fully up. Husband made dinner last night. I kept sleeping. I got up around 1am and ate nearly a whole bag of jelly beans. The sugar cravings are irresistible when I dip down into this depression so quickly. I got up to get kids to school today, and then went back to bed. Got up to get kid from school, and now I just want to sleep more. But I have a meeting soon, and need to shake this feeling and be me again. When I am me, they call me brilliant. When I am depressed, they call me tired, and ask if I am coming down with something?

Green: This color is often used in hospitals and schools. The human body generates green to show signs of distress and/or infection. Overall, green is a comforting color and exposure to it lowers heart rate and reduces stress. People who like green are usually loyal, understanding, and sympathetic friends. They often treasure freedom and love nature. Many times they are athletic, out-spoken, and self-disciplined.
I am at work. My half day a week in an office. Young people, older bosses, a pregnant woman I see and imagine the weeks, months, years ahead. I talk to her occasionally: she spends a lot of time waiting for lifts and coming and going and leaning and puffing out her cheeks. I don’t want to tell her too much of course, so I just tell her my wife was the same. She wouldn’t know I had a child if I didn’t tell her that. The office is one of the few places I have no link to childcare. I am not a stay at home dad there.

My apologies to my loyal followers. For the last month my life has been in disarray with a few major changes. A new, but temporary job… a new residence in a new neighborhood… medical issues… little to no Internet access and car problems have stymied my writing efforts of late. To say the least my posts have not been as frequent as I had hoped. But, with money coming in and Internet at home expected this week, things are finally looking up. My sincere thanks to all of you that visit here often and especially for your welcomed comments and support. Now on with the blog!
‘It’s here beauty that captures your attention, it’s her personality that captures your heart.’
I toiled across that bridge in the fetid warmth of the sun. I had my swag and a keyboard. I was also forced to wear a jacket. It couldn’t fit in my swag, I anticipated cold weather. Like a shrew this one of my many talents. Eventually I came to a bus stop, and thanks to the disgusting corruption of our corporatist regime, was able to get on a bus to Bungwahl free of charge.

Over dinner, Wilson made it clear that he knew pretty much all there was to know about Kevin Mulcahy, about his former employment with the C.I.A. and his current work with teen-agers. A few months later, Wilson made an offer Mulcahy would not refuse: If Mulcahy would join his arms-sales business in Washington and remain for one year, he could then have as a bonus a nine-bedroom farmhouse Wilson also owned and use it as a halfway house for troubled youths. Mulcahy’s guaranteed $50,000 annual income would be supplemented by commissions and expenses. ”I had no suspicions at all about the job,” Mulcahy recalls, and he began working hard. ”I was putting in 18 hours a day at first, dealing with 10,000 10,000 suppliers and inquiries about food, parachutes – any kind of equipment, from machine guns to aircraft. There was no reason for suspicion in those weeks.” Most of the business was aboveboard and involved the sale of highly technical equipment. Mulcahy was responsible for arranging export licenses, international letters of credit and shipping, and also for determining which manufacturers’ equipment would meet the specifications of the order.

I suppose it’s not worth worrying about, but to me it’s frustrating that I don’t know such a large part of my family. Perhaps you know how this feels, and I’d love to hear if you want to share your stories in the comments below. I don’t know what it is, but I hate the not knowing. I feel like I’m missing a part of who I am, or where I came from. This is mostly unfounded, since obviously I am my own person, but I’d still like to know how she influenced my life, or how she might have influenced my life had things been differently.

We're all so proud of the release of Tony's book. He's worked long and hard to make this happen, and it's no small feat to get the kind of pre-orders he has - thanks in large part to support from Beachbody customers and coaches. It just shows you that Tony is unique, and people want to know more!

The next day my class was visited by our new superintendent. He came in during our math workshop sat down with his entourage of TWELVE people, including a camera crew-very low key and inconspicuous : ) At the end of the lesson all of our visitors left and I applauded my kiddos on a job well done. The kids all wanted to know who was the really smart one (I held in a giggle) and let them know that Dr. Wise was the man who had been sitting in Victoria's chair. Without missing a beat my Alex very politely raised his hand, waited his turn and then said, "Well he can't be that smart. He didn't even remember to push in his chair." I lost it!
Every day of our lives we are faced with one problem of some shape or form. Life is an ongoing war and we are the targets of the enemy. We are constantly coming out of one problem, and solving another problem. Or we are going through one problem and entering another issue on top of that one. Whatever, is going on in your life, no matter how big or small; what is happening in your life can not erase Gods word (is written). What God says about you, is what you are even though you may not see it with your natural eyes. You need FAITH to overcome every challenge in your life to bring about the needed changes.
Still denying the coming revolution against the Marxist-Leninist ANC Regime?
For many a year, successive Governments have been trying to find a suitable way to deter people from ‘drug driving’. With a rising number of ‘legal highs’ available and mounting concern regarding the abuse of prescription drugs this ‘problem’ is now ranking high up on the Government’s agenda. The Justice Bill, which has specific clauses dealing with this issue, will be touched upon in the Queen’s Speech next month. Police station and roadside drug testing equipment will follow hot on the heels of this announcement.

When Metzger stated there was no direct object, he was in reference only to the Alexandrine manuscript which did not include US. It’s entirely arbitrary conjecture to say it wasn’t there because the A didn’t have it. The word “us” IS the direct object. The very fact that all the other manuscripts had US and the very fact that it is the very direct object that is stated to be NEEDED, that should tell us that it was the actual original reading. It makes perfect grammatical and syntactical sense. To claim the original text didn’t have a direct object, based upon ONE manuscript, and leaving the sentence syntactically awkward, is clearly a position that can’t be defended without presupposition and conjecture. Why Bruce so strongly defaults to the Alexandrine in this case is a bit of a mystery. Why would one assume that the Alexandrine is the BEST witness for Revelation?
Caine took this to mean that once he left the temple he was free to fraternise with females who chirped at him and stick his tongue into their honey pots. I think he got laid in the first episode of Kung Fu, after a woman he shacked up with said he must have “other needs” apart from “food and a place to sleep”. It has since been acknowledged that telling a woman you only need food and a place to sleep is a brilliant seduction technique. Women love to fuck men who don’t want to fuck them.
She was the one, who wasn’t very well-educated and married off at a tender age. I know it wasn’t her fault, but that always made me look down upon her as a parent who wasn’t contributing to her child’s studies. Although she was the best at whatever she did.

Mad Men – The best show on television. Full stop. No returns. Times infinity. Plus one. Mad Men is a fabulous show with a wonderful cast. It looks beautiful, it’s filled with tension, it’s funny and that third season finale is in the running for the best season finale of any show, ever.
I'm telling you we are really changing the way we view our food around here, we've stepped it up and gone almost 100% organic in our grocery shopping and are in the process of signing up for an organic produce delivery service.. we're leaning towards this one which allows you to customize what's in your order and the size of your order.
When the mother of Hachiyemon had heard these things, she was greatly alarmed; and, hastening at once to the parish-temple, she told the priest all that her son had confessed, and begged for ghostly help. The priest, who was a man of great age and experience, listened without surprise to the recital, and then said to her:
That’s all fine! You are quite welcome to be all gushing with sentimentality- go for it- but that is not what is there for me to say right now.
There are only two things that would have made Cee Lo Green's grammy performance better. The first is if his backing band would have been Doctor Teeth and the Electric Mayhem instead of a generic muppet band and if she would have left the lyrics alone.

The children gave me some lovely cards; Emily has given me two as she made one at nursery the other day, and she wrote really nicely (for her age) in both of them, so cute! Dec’s card was sweet and “perfect”. They bought me a box of Thornton’s Chocolates and the Dawn French autobiography. It will be a while until I can read that as I haven’t finished the Julie Walters one yet.
According to The Star, during the 16th century, Sir Francis Xavier was sailing from some Indonesian islands to Malacca when he was caught in a storm. He then dipped his crucifix into the sea and pray to God to calm the raging storm. Unfortunately, the crucifix slipped from his hand and dropped into the sea. He prayed to god that he could get it back. When he landed in Malacca he saw a crab on the beach clutching the same crucifix in its claw.Sir Francis was surprised and he knelt down to retrive the cross from the crab.

For anyone who loves letters, fonts, typesetting, stamps and general vintage goodies, Timeless Treasures is a shop you must put on your to do list if you ever make it to San Francisco. One girlfriend came along with me and picked up a vintage vase & candlestick holder while I poked my way through the drawers of little letters until I found what I wanted.

Finish: A slightly chalky last cleansing of the pallet leaves a drier than sweet coda.
So Congress could ban the speech of nonmedia business corporations, it could ban publications by corporate-run newspapers and magazines, the religious practices of most churches which are generally organized as corporations, most universities, incorporated unions and non-profits. All corporate entities would be stripped of all constitutional rights. All corporate entities would be treated as artificial creatures of the state. Congress could ban speech about elections and any other speech about religion, politics or anything else. It could ban speech on viewpoints that they didn’t like.
This is expertly illustrated by Robert Cialdini in Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, where he cites a study you’ve probably heard of, performed by Ellen Langer at Harvard. Langer asked to push in line at the library to photocopy some papers:
So this isn’t exactly a super duper exciting post or anything, but I think it will still be helpful to you guys. Besides the obvious and always used basics flour, sugar, butter, eggs, etc, etc, I have a couple other things around that I tend to use a lot and have around for cooking purposes. Here are a few of my favorite items that I use quite frequently…..

Ending his rounds, Captain Vendo returned to the cockpit. Only there did he end his concert. Sighing to himself, he repositioned the body slouching at tactical, holding his breath as he did so. Having set things back to the way they were meant to be, he departed for his quarters, giving only a cursory glance to the vast void of space that was the ship’s destination.
Book #75 of 2012
Brené Brown says that making connections with other people is why we're here. Also to enjoy ice cream and cookies, but treats weren't part of Brené's study. She says to allow connections with other people, you have to allow yourself to be seen, and for deeper connections really seen, which leaves you wide open and vulnerable, sometimes excruciatingly so. Cuz like, what if they notice your flaws? I totally have this weird freckle on my back. What if someone sees it and gets all judgey? But it's not just being seen physically; it's revealing who you are inside as a person. For instance, how did those insanely bizarre fetishes come about? Who instilled them into you, and was he ever prosecuted? And why have you embraced them as your go-to means of, you know, satisfaction?

You might have gotten from the trailer that Jiro Ono's training is intense and brutal. Apprentices train for years just to learn how to make rice. Apprentices must first learn how to wring hot towels in their hands before they may touch the food. Jiro's attitude towards his work shows a completely different approach than what most are used to seeing. Jiro never claims to be the best. Jiro was never cocky. Jiro and many of the other players in the movie approached their work as a craft. From the fish vendors to the apprentice chefs, many of them stated that they wanted to keep improving and learn better techniques.
The house was large, stone and imposing. There were no windows on the first floor, and only a few narrow windows above. The only entrance was a heavy oaken door with iron fittings. Now, anyone following along for any length of time will know that the heroes of this and the last adventure have a hrd time with walls, and climbing in general, and have learned from the bruises and blood loss to climb only as a last result. This meant Merrick the halfling thief had to curb his natural desire to climb intot he upper story window and instead content himself with picking the lock. He rolled a natural one, resulting in a puff of orange dust in the thief’s face. No it wasn’t poison, the rusting tumblers collapsing into a fused mess, the lock was unpickable.

Macedonia’s foreign minister, Nikola Poposki, is in Washington this week to make the case for Fyrom. He cites a list of statistics to prove that his tiny nation – with just 2 million people – already is giving more than its fair share to NATO missions, even as just an aspirant to membership.
The talk was part of the wonderful Expression 2012 - a retreat for young people in Salisbury, now in its third year. The topic I had been asked to speak about was ‘living your faith in the world’. So instead of making up my own list of ‘spiritual resources’ that could be helpful for any young Catholic trying to live their faith, I spoke about the ‘resources’ that the Church herself gives to each one of us at our baptism: a set of godparents (representing the support of the whole Church), a creed (representing the richness of the whole Catholic faith), a baptismal robe (representing our new-found dignity as a children of God and the purity of heart that we hope to preserve), and a baptismal candle (representing the light and love of Christ).

The United Nations was established to replace the League of Nations, which failed to prevent World War II. It has been similarly unsuccessful in its mission to maintain the peace between its member nations. It has also been unable to act in most of the many international crises that have arisen since its founding in 1945. So a restructuring of this institution is long overdue.
This last Saturday Paraguay celebrated its 200 birthday. They had a big (this term is being used loosely) parade downtown where many countries came to celebrate the day with Paraguay. After seeing all of these groups we wished we had just gone and watched because it looked so amazing (and I would really have rathered my kids not see some of the costumes so up close and personl.)

Then I spread my room temperature jam over the first layer. The jam didn’t go very far; I would probably increase the amount of jam by half if I were to make this one again. It then returned to the oven for about 35 minutes. It was starting to brown up nicely
The ethnic make-up of Dutch schools is a highly sensitive issue. The existence of separate ‘black’ and ‘white’ schools is generally regarded as undesirable. However, as long as the segregation leads to a homogenous student body, the effects are not necessarily negative. On the contrary, a ‘black’ school where 80 percent of the children were of Turkish descent outperformed a school of much greater ethnic diversity.
We will now look at some all-natural ways to detox the body from harmful substances.
