The people who will be in charge of this are the technologically minded. People tend to gravitate to new products without thinking about their possible repercussions. It falls to the people putting out the products to follow their own moral passions and convictions. Will you want to be remembered in the future as the person who developed the technology that caused humanity to fall into lethargy, or the one who propelled us to new heights as a species?
I was looking at the Dunkin Donuts calendar on my fridge yesterday after noon and realized not only is summer around the corner but so is mother’s day. I’ve been so busy with work and other projects that I realized I wouldn’t again remember that holiday until May 1.
Happy hopping!
Despite the beautiful weather, it is a stressful start to my week. I'll spare you the drama and just say that I came home this evening, exhausted. Carl is working late so that left me to care for the dogs alone. Todd is of course the one with the most energy. You'll remember in my last post his very favorite toy, 'red ball' was missing. We've moved furniture, searched in places that there's no way it could be, but we've been unable to find it. But tonight, throwing a tennis ball for him did the trick to wear him out.

I also got a stack of horror comics from Thailand. I'll try to get pics of them to post in the near future. During the next several days I'll be posting more pics from my trip. I hope you guys enjoy seeing it, because there's a lot.

There is another option open for workers in Ireland to argue. The Capitalist State says it has to bail-out the banks once again to prevent the Capitalist economy collapsing. It is asking the workers to rescue the Capitalists. In that case workers in Ireland could demand that all of the existing shares in those Banks be cancelled, and that every Man, Woman, and Child in Ireland be given free a non-Negotiable share in those banks. That would make them the direct owners of those banks with the right to have a direct say in their operation, including the salaries and bonuses paid out to Executives. It would mean that when those Banks began to turn a profit, that profit would go directly to the mass of workers, not to the capitalists or to their State. It would mean that they could utilise the resources of the Bank to invest in things that furthered the workers interests, not the bosses. Personally, I do not prefer this solution to the first, because the experience of Mutual Building Societies shows that where ownership is widely diffused to workers and others who do not have a direct interest in the day to day functioning of the business, who are not directly dependent upon it for their livelihood, they will not exercise active control, and they will be prone at some point to simply agree to sell it for a quick buck.

According to an excellent investigative article in the Texas Observer by reporter Renee Feltz ("Cracked," Jan. 8), seventeen men currently on Texas' death row were evaluated by a forensic psychologist using "junk science" who improperly inflated IQ scores to make them eligible for the death penalty despite Supreme Court caselaw banning execution of the mentally retarded.

Stacey and I got up and around about noon, and went by the Mercato Santa Ambrogio. The Market Stacey frequents, and it’s really close to her apartment and Santa Croche. I love going to markets. They’re such a beautiful gathering place. You see all types of people: the vendors were singing, women were walking their dogs, customers bartering and and friends meeting and gossiping in beautiful, smooth Italian. I loved it. I bought some beads for my mom and me, to make jewelry, and I bought some amazingly delicious olives for Stacey and I to take on our picnic we had planned for that day.

The plot is involving and action-packed. Peeler has ramped it up each time and I'm wondering what on earth she can do for the last three books, but I'll find out! The romance aspect is also intriguing and I'm enjoying the development of Jane's love life alongside her personal development - and these two are clearly linked. As a feminist reader, I have little patience with over-dominant males and passive females held up as the ideal, so I appreciate Peeler's work here.

"A lot of the rest of the day dealt with technical questions on the various schemes. Although these were supposed to be factual sessions there was a clear steer from all the speakers towards suspending action and endorsing the 'heads of agreement'. One official echoed Tories like Boris Johnson when he said that there wasn't majority support for action because only 27% voted, clearly ignoring the huge support for the strike itself. A national official gave the briefing for Local Government and Civil Service. Both these sessions were based on Powerpoint presentations sent down from London only that morning.
The story isn’t bad either. I won’t give away the twist ending (like the UK Pan edition does with its cover art — don’t worry, you’ll see it eventually), but I heartily recommend that you read this book.

I am so excited about this project. My friend Katy at the Littlest Thistle posted her entry - a wonderful notebook cover and large pencil case. When I commented on her post that maybe I would make something with the trimmings I had ordered and enter the contest too, she said something like she wondered what I would make. Well that started me thinking. But it is so busy in my life right now, so much noise all the time.

Yep. It was a great summer. Full of beauty and love and RAIN and friends and food and RAIN and bike rides and picnics and cold breezes and RAIN. Did I mention rain? One thing I'm tired of hearing is this whole, wow it's so cold & crappy out schtick. I just got back from vacay myself. The change from swimming in 80 degree aqua waters and basking in the golden rays of sun from a clear blue sky so gorgeous you start believing in God, to the gray skies of Paris in its dirty, honking, frowning, black-wearing glory is obvious enough without you telling me about it every 10 seconds.

In fact, there were quite a few terms that riled the conference participants. From the journalists who simply did not want to “partner” with tourism officials and those who questioned what constitutes contemporary journalism or simply ‘media.’ Huffington Posts’s @andrewburmon knocked the very concept: “The media as a concept is useful for discussions but beyond that it doesn’t exist.” What did the event organizers make of that?!

Reliving your memory,
The card I made is using a digi image I drew for Katie. I have always loved the elegance of mermaids and I felt the sea stars symbolize the enduring light of stars, whose brilliance is shining upon us from the distant past, guiding the way for travelers over the eons.
While dejected and feeling insecure and full of doubt, I have to still focus on the inches I have lost. 16 inches and counting. No gain-backs... although there have been some "stay the same" times. I have improved in my fitness assessments steadily and I have noticed so many differences in my daily life. But I'm having such a hard time getting re-focused. That little voice is taunting me. I'm tired, I'm whiny and I'm coming up with too many excuses.
Hydration capacity: Meh - but that's to be expected from a long-lasting product. (The wear time is excellent for this, BTW; it does last for at least two hours.) I did notice that the moisturizing properties get juiced up with a little lip balm, though.

A number of questions arise: why are breweries bothering?; who's drinking this stuff?; is it any good?; does this signal the end of civilization? All worthy of response, and I shall come to them in due time. But first, let's review why these damnable beers exist in the first place.
An arm caught me around the waist,pulling me onto the dance floor.I recovered my footing quickly,holding his hands in mine and falling in step with Kavya.Kavya,who was pure mischief and a bastard in the game of hearts.As he spun me into an intricate turn,his eyes sparkled with innocent delight,with a fervent hope and an intense faith in my capability to love again.I let him lead me around,wondering how really good he was at it.A guy who can understand and speak in the wordless expressions the beats and turns signified; can you imagine the sarcasm destiny had a way to throw at me ? I could almost hear the three hags giggle in mirth.I had to try and resist myself from loving a guy who was leaving no stones unturned to make sure i give in.I mean,just look at the things the man was doing for me ! He called himself my ” Rebound Romeo” ( a term most of the other guys would self-combust at ),would listen to all of my sob-stories,take me out to crappy movies we laughed our asses off and proposed to me in the middle of my Insurance Law class (i was majorly surprised later when i recalled that i hadn’t even looked at Aham at the time ),which needless to say,did not help much with my grades in a project i was already late for.To top it all,my mom and dad were literally abetting the guy in his endeavour.Mom actually gave away my favourites in music to the Pied Piper,which immediately resulted in the daily delivery of a mixed DVD at my place.Worse still,the songs were all fabulous and a treat to discover and indulge in.
How on earth will Mitt Romney fare in such a contest? He was born with a silver spoon the size of a thriving auto company, spent his adolescence in a posh private school, spent two years in Paris on the tab of the Mormons, then romped off to Brigham Young and soon landed in the rose garden of Harvard. Since then, Romney has spent nearly all of his adult life flitting from one corporate board room to the next, buying up companies, laying off workers in one downsizing maneuver after another, growing very, very rich on what Obama will say was the suffering of far more downtrodden and worthy souls. And if faced off with Barack Obama, the son of a goat herder and a teenage mom, Mitt Romney will become the white, posh, country-club punching bag for all the new Obama-impoverished voters and their limousine-liberal enablers.
Black IPA: Everyone’s interpretation of this style seems to differ. Here the emphasis was on the roast flavour with bitterness coming through later.
If pressure can’t be found up front, passing situations could become quite a task as the Bulldogs have a difficult challenge of finding new replacements for three open spots vacated by some key names from the 2001 squad. Both interception leaders are gone. Only one cornerback, Bruce Thornton, dots the roster with any real playing experience. The corners should be fine if Decory Bryant can continue as a solid cover man. This area has to be one of the biggest mysteries facing the relatively new coaching staff. If the Bulldogs are going to have any success at competing with the SEC frontrunners, this unit will need to learn quickly. Claiming the backfield does not possess any talent may not be suitable; there is just no starting experience.

This was my first author interview ever, and I was incredibly nervous. Half the time I felt tongue-tied, and the other half I felt like I was stammering inarticulate wrong things, but Ross Payton was incredibly kind, very intelligent, well-informed, and utterly fascinating to talk to. It was an incredible experience, and I'm very grateful to Mr. Payton for the opportunity.

One of the most remarkable things about it is the blind faith that marketers continue to have in it despite its questionable record as a marketing vehicle.
Our waitress brings us a menu and takes our drink order. What do people drink in this strange and foreign land? Mercury? Sap? The blood of tourists? It’s too dark to see the menu, so I lamely ask for a glass of water. My wife spots a sign on the wall advertising the grapefruit margaritas, and has one of those. I’d try a sip, but my Lipitor bottle specifically forbids grapefruit, and I don’t want to die in a “gastropub.” The waitress would thank me for giving her such a great story to tell her cool friends; still, that’s a high price to pay.
A sentence or quote might stand out to you. Though they are just a bunch of words, they can determine if your reader becomes captivated or will yawn at every single word. A sentence in a story determines all of the sentences that come after it.
See, I think much like knowledge can kill the adventuring spirit of a young lad or lass, thinking too much about what’s come before and whether or not you’re being original, kills the drive within people to explore their own philosophy. Instead of reasoning through hard questions based on their own beliefs, people too often quote precedent from long-dead philosophers who lived in a time that was much different than now. I once came up with something that I thought was terribly clever and insightful, upon further examination, it’s likely many others have said it before: “We remember too much and forget too little.” Despite the fact that others have said it and that it may not even make a whole lot of sense, nor is it THAT insightful, nothing can take away the feeling I had when I realized this one truth. Because even as I write this now, I see parallels in my life and in my writing. We remember too much of the impossible and we forget too much of the act of discovery and realization.
Before I knew it, I was attending beerfests, going to breweries, and making what seems like daily visits to BevMo, Total Wine, and just about any other place I could find the next new beer. It became a passion. And it was all in the interest of writing my opinions about my new discoveries.

But to the point at hand, I don’t think I have the artistic ability or stamina to think of and animate a steady character. I tried this once on an old site I had (trust me, it was way less shitty than this one), but I quit halfway into the first comic. You could say I have ADHD, but in reality I have a chronic case of not giving more than 0.0000119 of a fuck. Plus, I do funny things in spare time when I’m not being a productive member of society -or I’m not regretting all the life decisions which got me to this point- and drawing actual things is time consuming. One time I tried to draw a poster for someone (for free, no commission involved) but I decided instead to stick my thumb up my butt and watch Robin Williams films.
Thomas Nelson’s announcement to enter into self-publishing services is not so much the story, but rather the fact that Author Solutions is the company who Thomas Nelson have decided to enter into what is described as a strategic partnership. Author Solutions Inc will manage the running of WestBow Press which will include the responsibility for the design, print, and distribution of the imprint. Like a commercial vacuum cleaner, Author Solutions has busied itself over the past few years acquiring AuthorHouse, iUniverse, Xlibris, WordClay, and most recently, Trafford Publishing. A nice collection of author solution companies for the trophy cabinet, even if I do say so myself.
It is also when Venus cannot be seen from Earth because of the sun’s brilliance, but as she continues to orbit, not only does she appear to go into ‘retrograde’ motion — a phenomenon caused by both bodies in orbit passing each other at different speeds — but she suddenly becomes visible again at greatest brilliance. Five Venus cycles of 548 days exactly equals 8 Earth cycles of 365 days — 8 Earth years — to bring both planets back in line to synodic point. When Venus is on the opposite side of the Sun its position is called ‘superior conjunction’ and has weakest brilliance. In between Venus appears to stretch to ‘extreme elongation’ to either side of Earth. The Maya also noticed Venus’s ‘stages’ took exactly 36 days, or multiples of 36.

One of our favorite places to visit is Wojick's. It's a family run farm with a good variety of apples. They, unlike Tougas Family Farm, spray pesticides liberally. I asked someone there if they spray their apples. She looked at me, dead pan, and said, "Yes. Make sure to wash your apples before eating them." I try not to buy produce that's sprayed, however, spraying means cheaper. I own soap and have access to water. We simply wash our apples prior to consuming. By cheaper, I mean 50% cheaper than other places that practice IPM (Integrated Pest Management) or follow organic practices. I'm all for organic, but when I'm putting up quart after quart of applesauce, I simply cannot afford organic. Now that I'm all on the defensive...

So in the process of training to become a great athlete, if you must use something to "assist" you to achieve your desired results outside of what you came to this earth with, THAT is an enhancement. That is cheating based on the rules of sport - because it provides an unfair advantage over those athletes that train and compete without unnatural, chemically enhanced assistance. So McGwire using drugs to keep from being injured WAS cheating. He was dirty, based on the rules of sport. Next I will be talking about clean vs dirty.
The teachers didn’t even raise their voices at the kids (and there were a few occasions when I felt like one of the kids needed a real ear full). Even when kids were incessantly tattling on one another, the teachers approached it with calm and grace. I’ve always known that Little S’s teachers do an amazing job, but watching them in action has raised them to a higher level in my eyes.
That being said, I’m not a good dancer. At least, I don’t think so.

The most famous incident was a couple years ago at McMurdo, a guy bashed in the heads of two other guys with a hammer. A few people here with me at Palmer now were at McMurdo when it happened, and while the back story is complicated, it wasn't a drunken brawl or something like that. This guy had just been here WAY too long, had been trying to leave for a while, but was in a fairly important roll and they didn't want to do without him. As a result of this incident, there were rules put in place stating that if someone wants to leave, you HAVE to let them, ASAP, no exceptions. But this guy simply walked into housewares, checked out a hammer, walked into the gally, gave each of these other two guys a single good swing to the head . . . walked back to housewares, and turned the hammer back in. Some guys found him half an hour later wandering up and down one of the dorm hallways singing "Mary had a little lamb" quietly over and over to himself. The guys he attacked with the hammer both survived, and he's doing time in Hawaii last I heard. But from what I'm able to gather, the people directly involved in the incident were surprised he had to do any time at all. It was a complicated situation.

Note the little sample glasses in front of the pumps. For some time now the Baum has these dinky little glasses to show the customers what the beers on offer look like.

The one area where I might agree is that people don't know what the group is or does by the name. They need a Facebook page or something. If I were in a parish and I saw "Join Mary's Chain Gang!" in the church bulletin, I would be intrigued. Maybe people just don't like making rosaries there.
The relentless Achiever can stop and ask herself, do I really want to be doing all of this? Is this really me? What sacrifice am I making for my self-interested accomplishments? If I’m telling myself that I must do these things for the sake of my family, am I certain that is true? When the Achiever sees through her projections, she can finally take a long, languorous breath and start regaining her balance. Indeed, she might find that she truly loves what she is doing, but she is no longer driven by fear of failure or by compulsion. People around her can feel her transformation. Suddenly she is warm and vulnerable and capable of deeply connecting with others in her life. Even her dog greets her with more excitement when she returns home after a “not as long” day at the office.
After all that activity, we were ready to head home and relax for the rest of the afternoon - I needed a nap after getting up that early and the boys chilled out with the Ratchet and Clank game a friend lent them.

The irony is that there are sources of information on true, deep, old, witching lines. Unbroken enough to be likely candidates for the shennanigans at Saveock Water - but if "seekers" balk at a photo of bread lovingly smeared with menstrual blood, I think they'd balk a lot harder at anecdotes like: "And so I had ritual sex with my high-priestess while her moon flowed. And those co-mingled fluids were then used to rim the wineglass from which the rest of the covine drank." Even if it's VERY Traditional, and VERY potent stuff... it's just not for everyone. It's not their table, and they're not invited, anyway.

He had the air of a man about to buy the place, he waved around the various rooms indicating where they'd be putting new carpets and fresh wall paper. Change was tangible, the wicked witch was gone and Major surely couldn't hang on in the face of Blair's appeal to Essex Man. Spurred on by the death of John Smith MP, Labour were in prime position to grab a record 56 seats in Scotland a couple of years time.

Cheesy analogies aside, I couldn’t help but write something this past weekend, for something monumental has happened in the last week that simply cannot be ignored, not even by us lazy rickshaw writers. If you haven’t heard, England is paying a visit to the United Arab Emirates. After smashing the former No. 1 side in Tests, i.e. India, 4-0 at home, England took their place at the top of the perch, and were keen to show the world they can do it in Asia as well. Of course, Pakistan has been in good nick as well, though beating Bangladesh is never really anything to write home about; Sri Lanka are quickly getting worse as time goes on; and we didn’t even manage to beat the woeful West Indies outright. Still we had some form coming in, and were relishing the test.
They ended up having Focke Wulf FW-190D Dora’s flying around overhead at air bases to protect them when they were landing (they painted the Dora’s underwings with bright red and white stripes so the Me-262 pilots and anti-aircraft artillery spotters would know they were friendly).

To make these pomanders, all you need is a styrofoam ball, a bit of ribbon or lace and some pearls or brads for the centres. I just cut multitudes of the small flowers from Judy's Blooms, placed one on top of another and glued them into place around the ball. I inked the edges and glimmer misted all the petals and then spritzed the whole lot with water and lavender essential oil, (for the purple one and water and rose essential oil for the pink one.).

This is the first time I have come across the term thermalized. According to curdnerds, thermalization involves heating milk only to 60-65 °C/140-150 °F for 15 to 30 seconds then chilling before re-heating at the start of cheesemaking. This process reduces the number of micro-organisms, but not so much so that the resulting cheese will be without flavor. The United States FDA considers this still to be raw milk, while the European Union considered it pasteurized.

Statehood is a responsibility to be earned. And so far the Palestinian national movement has hardly proved its willingness to live in peace beside Israel. Palestinian schools and media — those of Fatah as well as of Hamas — routinely portray Israel as an artificial and temporary creation, without any rootedness in the land. All of Jewish history — from the ancient temple in Jerusalem to the Holocaust — is dismissed as a lie. No Palestinian leader has told his people — as Israeli prime ministers since Yitzhak Rabin have told their people — that the land must be shared by two nations. Instead, Palestinian leaders have consistently told their people that the goal is a state on all the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, and they encourage their people to dream of a Middle East without Israel.

We believe that the use of the words “racial or “racially motivated” are in themselves inaccurate and confusing because we all belong to one human race, regardless of our colour, culture or ethnic origin. When referring to crime or incidents involving racism we believe “racist” to be the appropriate adjective (para, 45.17).
In the beginning, the Lord said when he gave Eve to Adam, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it.” This earth was created for the very purpose that the spirit children of our Father might have the privilege of the temporal existence, receiving bodies of flesh and bones as tabernacles for the spirits which occupy them, and then, through the atonement of Jesus Christ, receive the resurrection in which the spirit and the body become inseparably connected so that man may live again. . . .

Neither the government, nor the public have the authority to arbitrarily take, or rescind the rights of ownership for purposes other than those that are not absolutely indispensable to the public interest. Further, if before the implementation of the Smoke Free Work Place Act there had been no Smoke Free environments available in which to work or to patronize, that would be cause for such legislation to be implemented in the interest of the public.

With each therapy, not only did I feel like I was chasing my tail, I went deeper into despair and depression, Connor seemed to retreat into his world, further from me emotionally. It seemed like, the more discomfort I was feeling within, the less this child wanted to be in our world.

The South African Government - the ANC - are proposing a cap on salaries and bonuses for managers earning more than R550 000/year ($78 000) and those earning R20 000 per month! The slide to communism and socialism is gathering speed; nationalising the mines, curbing free press, regulating free enterprise...Religion will be next so that the "elite" will appear to be the be all and end all of saviours. Another African success story brought to you in just 16 short years of ANC rule. If this proposal is accepted then expect to see more skilled people fleeing the country - leaving behind the mediocre and those unfortunate enough not to be in a position to leave due to circumstances. Wonder how many international businesses will be willing to open shop in the country or invest in the country? Hmmm....

The most enjoyable thing for me was walking down the streets of HK at night. Neon lights, the assorted smells wafting from roadside eateries, the relaxed chatter of schoolchildren and adults alike; everything amalgamated into some collective pursuit for something I can’t quite put my finger on, some goal that keeps everyone striving on. Oh, and the weather was perfect too! 15 to 20 degrees celsius!

In computer security, the dancing pigs problem (also known as the dancing bunnies problem) is a statement on user attitudes to computer security: that users primarily desire features without considering security, and so security must be designed in without the computer having to ask a technically ignorant user. The term has its origin in a remark by computer scientists Edward Felten and Gary McGraw: ‘Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time.’ Computer security expert Bruce Schneier expands on this remark as follows: ‘If J. Random Websurfer clicks on a button that promises dancing pigs on his computer monitor, and instead gets a hortatory message describing the potential dangers of the applet — he’s going to choose dancing pigs over computer security any day. If the computer prompts him with a warning screen like: ‘The applet DANCING PIGS could contain malicious code that might do permanent damage to your computer, steal your life’s savings, and impair your ability to have children,’ he’ll click OK without even reading it. Thirty seconds later he won’t even remember that the warning screen even existed.’

It is heartening to observe that politically-aware people in European nations are waking up, however slowly, to the catastrophe that Muslim immigration is busy shaping for them. As a direct consequence of this awakening there are prominent political figures in at least some European countries who have started to advocate what would be considered, in my scheme, Option 1, mixed with small amounts of Option 2. The most illustrative example is to be found in the Netherlands.

It's a ridiculous thing. I'm really fond of it. I like more than half of the songs, easily, but... Jesus is it a weird fucking thing. We just didn't know what the fuck we were doing.

Things started looking up when the next course arrived. Described on the menu as “mackerel, green vegetables, cucumber water” (whatever that may be), it was delicious. Not least because of the “salicorne” – a type of seagrass – the raw cornichons and almonds with which it was served. Next came the “lotillon au foin, carottes” a finely balanced dish of white fish and fresh vegetables. I love a bit of lotte in my life – it’s a fish with a fantastic texture, cooked to airy perfection by Mr Aizpitarte & Co. (forgive me if I , keep gratuitously keep dropping his name into this blog entry – I just find Basque names with their x’s and z’s and general unpronuncability brilliant). Easily my favourite dish of the evening was the pigeon (and there’s a phrase I never thought I’d utter). We were gravely informed at the start of the meal that the pigeons were sourced direct from the (apparently) reputable pigeon farmer, “Paul Renault”. I’ve no idea who Paul Renault is, but his name was whispered with such reverence by our waiter, I can only assume he is the king of pigeon farmers. Though I can’t help but speculate the provenance of the pigeons was emphasised lest any of us clearly uncouth diners worried Mr Aizpitarte had spent a profitable couple of hours pigeon collecting down at the Pompidou Centre or Les Halles. Wherever the pigeons came from, they were extraordinarily good. Served with finely sliced beetroot, a bitter radicchio-type leaf vegetable and cranberries, it was melt-in-the-mouth good.

J. Liebling's opus "Between Meals, An Appetite For Paris" which raised my desire for this trip to a fever pitch so many years ago. I also threw in a copy of A Dog's Head by my current favorite writer, Jean Dutourd, for good luck and to show off with while reading in some Parisian park or another.

Once the chocolate is melted place waxed paper onto the counter top and use two forks to dip the balls into the chocolate. The best way to dip them is to drop the ball into the chocolate, then kind of fold the chocolate around the ball with both forks, being careful not to touch the dough with the forks. This prevents the ball from breaking off little black cookie bits into the chocolate. Then lift the ball out with one fork and scrap the bottom of the fork on the edge of the bowl, to remove any excess chocolate. Lastly place the ball onto the waxed paper by scooting it off the fork using the other fork. There will be little trails of chocolate all over the place but

Mike then surprised us by saying he was just going to walk. “My legs feel so good and so strong, I’m just going to go for it.” I quickly responded, “Do you want us to hold your hands or stand closer by you?” He was confident, “No, I’m fine.” He then took about 8 steps – completely unassisted, turned around, and walked back to his chair. He did this on 3 different occasions and then once while pushing his chair. We asked him how he felt. He said the only “issue” he was having was realizing the soreness in his legs just from all the walking/standing he had done for the first time in a year. “I could walk a thousand miles but my muscles need to catch up with my heart.” He even wanted to join us for lunch down a super steep flight of stairs in the church and we were the ones telling him just to take it easy and that we’d bring lunch up to him.

What I can say about “getting ripped” in the look-at-me-I’m-so-ripped-and-good-looking sense is that it isn’t worth it. It takes a ridiculous amount of work both in terms of adherence to a strict diet and a lot of exercise. Also, once you get to that point, then what? Stay ripped and miss out on eating a cookie every now and then? Screw that. I can also say that even though I looked very athletic, I felt weaker than I was at my normal athletic shape when I was consuming plenty of carbohydrates, occasionally allowing my inner fat kid to come out and splurge on $15 of Taco Bell in one sitting (yet still exercising regularly).

Technological advances, particularly since the 1970s, have massively and rapidly altered the capitalist system in one crucial respect.

According to his analysis, "the ANC started their highly effective clandestine policy of genocide and crimes against humanity through the deliberate implementation and very effective utilisation of extremely high rates of extreme violent crime against white Afrikaner farmers during 1986 whilst still in exile". When the ANC took power in government in 1994, these attacks were "escalated through deliberate state inaction, state neglect and refusal to act against crime". Gun laws, which he said made it difficult to own a firearm, had "greatly contributed" to the rapid increase of crimes committed against the Afrikaner. 'Arsenal of genocidal weapons' It is all an extension of the ANC's armed struggle and its goal was to "remove the white minority from South Africa". Men were especially being targeted. The ANC's "very effective arsenal of genocidal weapons" included:
Estella's Revenge has been through some distinct phases. Including a name change. While the address was always Estella's Revenge, the original blog title was Tripping Toward Lucidity. As I was working my way through my Masters degree I felt as if I was just stumbling along trying to accomplish whatever was right for me. I was saucy then, bordering on angry, and just finding myself in the world.

I also showed you how you can propagate by just cutting off succulent heads, scabbing them over and putting them directly in soil. Well, I cut too many heads and didn’t have enough planters, so some of the heads I left sitting on the perlite. Well, wouldn’t you know it, they also started to push out roots. These should be placed in soil pronto as the leaves are getting really thin, indicating that it’s using all it’s juice to make those roots and needs water soon.
Yum. Yum. This smoothie was tart, 'cause of the pineapple and lemon juice. Really tasty.

I went into the race feeling great! In the weeks leading up to the race I had logged a few 7 and 8 mile long, hills runs at paces of 6:39, 6:41, and 6:43!!! I was ready for a GREAT race!
First, I think it's important to know it happens and it's normal. You aren't a failed writer if you make mistakes, if your piece isn't perfect, if your favourite agent rejects your story.
He looked at me. I looked at him. He said “I don’t understand. It’s working now. I’m in tech support too and I’ve been trying to make this work for the past week. I even called in for help and they couldn’t do anything. I was on the line with them for 3 hours.”

Who is to be blamed in this unnecessarily provoked conflict situation? (All conflicts are unnecessary – if you analyze it critically.)
Never one to not criticize America, Obama reminded the delegates that America was “the world’s second largest emitter” of greenhouse gases even though such gases do not function as a greenhouse, trapping and holding heat. If they did, how would one explain the fact that the Earth has been in a natural cooling cycle since around 1998?
Eclecticism can be really hard work, or really easy. It’s rarely in-between. You are given two choices; borrow a little bit of this and that and don’t stress too much about the way you are mashing it together, or borrow a little bit of this and that and consume yourself with the agony and peril of the consequences of the mashing, melding, squeezing and angst that accompanies intellectual eclecticism- yuck! Personally I jump between these two choices- hop, hop, hopping from one frame of mind to the next, hoping that this mild pain is simply ‘spiritual growth’ and that because I feel alternately challenged and sublime within my choices then I must be doing something right- I’m growing, yeah? Or something.
which I responded to by taking each unit on with my Terminators, whilst my Emperors Champion moved off solo to take out Mike's deckchair unit, and the Command Squad consolidated its position with my scoring units. The game was set to be a draw, I had diverted so much back to deal with the Wolf Scouts and lost so many scoring units to them at the same time, I could only just score enough to draw. The game however continued.

Thanksgiving, which is like a giant summary holiday, emphasizing what all holidays are about—taking a step back to realize and appreciate our blessings. I like that people in the U.S. of all faiths and cultures celebrate this holiday together. Even though it’s a bit melancholy, I also love Yom Kippur. The bittersweet language, the image of the book of life, speaks to my heart. I feel a fresh start at Yom Kippur services every year. We can all use some extra chances to put things right. Plus there’s nothing like my mother-in-law’s kugel after a day of fasting! (with all these food references, can you tell fasting doesn't come easy to me???)

I've had a long, tiring day and my laptop battery only gives me about half an hour now, so instead of a long, detail-by-detail recap of this week's episode, I'm going to give you my thoughts as I watch it a second time. Spoiler alert: I was completely delighted.
It was a cool first day and cool to be at the first Actionfest ever. I hope to see it grow in the future, especially so I can bitch about kids these days and how in my day I had to eat peanut butter and white bread out of the back of my car just to be able to finally see The Good, The Bad, and The Weird on the big screen.
Just to keep y'all occupied in my absence though, I am posting this cassette I picked up on my recent Marrakech visit. It was recommended to me by the owner of a music shop located in the back room of an electrical goods shop just off the Djemaa el Fna telling me the singer is from Marrakech. I have no idea what type of music it is, and its fair to say I've never heard anything quite like it. I was disappointed when I first put the tape on and really though it would not be my cup o' tea, but the tempo increases over the course of side one until you're absolutely swept away by the demented energy of it all. It appears to be a live recording and, gosh, it does sound like some party!

Besides, the Empress was dead. It was time to put Operation Thunderclap into effect. In the morning, the senators would start to gather in the Senate Hall for the first day of deliberations to choose a new Emperor. And once Lorovic was certain that all of them were in the Hall… Boom. Lorovic smiled, and then he chuckled to himself, and then his chuckles quickly turned into full-blown laughter. It was a strange sound coming from the normally stoic and reserved security officer, but he felt that it was justified, just this once.
We spent a lot of time outside this weekend. By Saturday night my eyes, all around my nose, and even around the outside of my mouth were tingly from the pollen assaults. Thank you, massive cottonwoods.
The mainline churches played a big role in the demise of Western influence throughout Africa, too; especially in South Africa. Today's tyrants were yesterday's mission-school protégés. Many dictators in Africa were men of the cloth. They knew their clerical collars would deflect criticism and obfuscate their real aims, which had nothing whatever to do with the "brotherhood of man."

So where are we at the moment and who is right? Are bond markets seeing the future of a low growth environment right or are the equity guys right in expecting that things will be getting better soon and the move out of the secular bear to a secular bull is afoot.

When I really think about it I feel selfish and silly for letting these setbacks get me so upset. Cameron is a beautiful and fairly healthy boy and a tremendous blessing. There are other families out there that I know or just follow online and their everyday life has so much more pain. I think that knowing what they go through helps me to appreciate what we have but at the same time it scares me for what they say will come.
This is all not to imply that my best days are behind me! As you know if you’ve been reading me, I’ve put in a lot of time and effort into trying to get myself in a better place, and it does feel like 2012 is going to be a great year for me. But I do think, when life sometimes gets frustrating, and when hopes and dreams sometimes feel far away, it helps to take stock at the wonderful things you’ve already had the privilege of experiencing. Life is so damn short, and time seems to move so fast, taking stock of what you’ve done is as important as planning for the future.

They are having so much fun and I love them being outside and using their imaginations.

Here’s a question… is your marriage living up to what Jesus wants? The fact that there is next to no difference in the divorce rate of “Christians” and “non-Christians” is appalling! So why is this the case? Because our marriages don’t reflect the compassion of Christ…instead they embody the conflict of Satan. Marraige quickly becomes all about me and less about what the other person wants. We are quick to anger and slow to forgive and forget…and it’s because we lack the compassion and humility of Christ.

Cheri asks us to check the purity of our motives (which I TOTALLY get because I’m guilty of this, too). But He is telling me to check the purity of my thoughts. Am I really thinking pure thoughts? Are my thoughts really free of negativity and criticism? Am I just covering up the negative thoughts? Er…I want to believe that I am actually changing my thoughts but there He is again saying, “Go the distance….”

Now, for anything else to make sense, I’m gunna have to do it in chronological order (I know, SOOOO boring ;D). So, we start the day off with me on the bus, with Chris sitting next to Lottie, Tom sitting next to Gemma, those 4 in 4 seats facing each other, and me in the seat on the other side of the aisle (yes, our seating positions IS important). We talked about a few things, the main 2 topics being Geology & the exam, and Peru, more specifically the ‘toilet tales’ of the trip, which were rather… squeamish, perhaps, that might not be the best word. Anyway, Lottie certainly found it a little bit. She leaned into Chris, who put his arm around her, and kept it on the back of the seat around her. I thought it was a little strange, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and just assumed he had found it comfortable to rest it there. When we were walking up to the College, Gemma had left us to go to Harry’s house, and I was walking with Tom while the other 2 were walking behind us. I couldn’t see them properly, but every time I turned round he either had his arm around her, were holding hands or had their arms interlocked (I couldn’t tell which). I thought this was very odd, especially as he is going out with Phoebe. Frankly I don’t see what she sees in him, or anyone for that matter. And that’s nothing to do with personality, I just don’t think he is all that good looking. But then again, what do I know about what makes a guy good looking ;) Me and Tom headed off to the Undercroft, and we saw those 2 heading towards the Physics/Media/whatever-else-is-up-there department together. Me and Tom did wonder where they were going. I texted her but she didn’t reply.
Today was pretty good. I felt full for most of the day, but my blood sugar dropped on the way home so I crammed an orange and a banana in my mouth the moment I walked in the door.

Not only does the Notebook have the kiss in the rain, the Last Song was home to Miley and Liams unfairly good-looking romance, oh and of course she was a double threat! Sung the main song, why not! I’d have done the same…A Walk to Remember sees Mandy Moore as a double threat also! Dear John, well I was to busy watching Channing Tatum to really take it in…And as for The Lucky One, which I awkwardly keep calling the Last one…It delivered all you expect from a film based on one of Sparky’s novels. And for me, it was a winner. Romance, KAYYYUTE kissing scene, eye candy, drama and Zac Efron standing in just his Black Briefs. What more could you want from a movie?
I look straight. I’ll admit it. Really straight. As much as I felt like there was a big rainbow spotlight on me all throughout my closeted high school years…I think I have to own up to the fact that everyone was shocked and surprised when I came out.

Christopher Nolan’s sophomore film, Memento, is arguably a giant experiment in editing. It re-invents the needs of montage editing for its own narrative purposes. By opening the film in reverse, then playing subsequent scenes in not only the wrong order, but in the reverse order, Memento forces the viewer to reevaluate everything previously established in montage technique.

Also noteworthy is the fact that I used farm fresh eggs from Aagaard Farms. I know that I talk a lot about them, but they’re really wonderful. Their blog is always interesting, and they keep reminding me how good it feels to support the people living and working in my community. I’ve taken this to the extreme by vowing to never working in a chain store ever again. I also don’t shop at huge chain stores. I make my regular groceries stops at Heritage Co-op here in town (because at least it’s a co-operative). I bank at Westoba Credit Union (also a co-operative), and I frequent as many ‘mom & pop’ stores as I can. A few of my favorites are Obermaier’s, Clancy’s, The Double Decker Tavern. I also like to have my car serviced at a locally owned shop which also happens to be really close to my own work. I’m also exceedingly excited to note that Brandon will soon have a Global Market. Aagaard Farms recently blogged about the fact that they’re moving there, and I can’t wait to see what else happens to take up space there. I’m also really interested to see music there every Saturday of the summer!
Gotta run. As soon as I typed "down time" some work popped up for me. The ER is getting busier at nights now. I can tell the winter is approaching soon. Once the "snow birds" get here from back east, I'll be wishing I was back on vacation again. Hell... I already do.

Norris J dealt with a number of issues under this head, most notably asking: “what does Perini generally have to prove to show that LPC’s infringement … caused the loss claimed by Perini?” The defendant had argued that, because the infringement related to the use of a process, this meant that, as a matter of logic, damages could not be recovered in respect of machinery already supplied before the infringing use took place. Norris J rejected this argument:

They’re also good way to save plants through the winter. Unlike growing herbs in the ground where the roots or the spread of seeds can often bring back an herb year after year. A container herb probably won’t last through the winter. If you leave it in the container it will probably get too cold and if you move it into garbage bags it’ll be hard to find if it lasts at all. I’ve had tarragon and mint survive the bag but I like a bit more security.
Last year the National Trust gave Watch List status on our 11 Most Endangered List to the Charleston Waterfront. We took this unprecedented step because of the potential for unregulated cruise ship activity to upset the economic profile and fragile balance of livability that marks Charleston as a special and remarkable city. We had reasonable goals in getting involved in this issue: to foster public dialogue, study legal avenues for regulation and conduct an unbiased assessment of cruise ship tourism. We sought to help resolve the issue here and use these lessons to help other communities facing expansion of cruise tourism. What we found, however, was that the issue was so divisive and contentious locally that our ability to work with city government and maritime officials was compromised.
I had my check up with the Dr. at the hospital. I was weighed for the first time, holy cow I had lost 10 pounds. The Dr. cleared me to go back home. I wanted to go back so badly, but PC had to write a report and they thought there wasn't enough time for them to write it and me to make it to the flight. Boo. I met the other medvac from Ukraine, and went to dinner with her and two COSing (close of service) volunteers from Thailand. She was super nice and showed me how to use the sky train.

Our chiropractor and I had a discussion about this today. Her daughter has a severe peanut allergy and she does not allow her children to eat much sugar in general. She allows her two kids to go out trick or treating for a few blocks and when they arrive home, they swap out 6 or 7 treats for "surprise" treats from mom and dad (healthier, allergy friendly alternatives) and the rest of the candy gets handed out to kids in the neighborhood. This is the tradition so they do not mind it at all (these two kiddos are under 10 - as they get older, I am sure the approach will have to change!)
The world around me is changing.
Throughout the Old Testament story, the foreigner is often portrayed in a very negative light. However, one story shatters the negative cast of the foreigner and provides hope for undocumented workers, especially women, who are battered by waves of injustice and hate. Ruth, the Moabite woman who refused to leave her mother-in-law Naomi’s side, is blessed by Israel and in return she becomes a great blessing to the nation. Upon her return with Naomi to Israel, she gleans in the field because she and Naomi have no land of their own. She finds favor in the eyes of Boaz, who protects her from the young men in other fields who might “bother” her – a familiar reality for millions of undocumented women working in the fields today. Ruth is forced to depend on the laws of Israel for her continued survival and Naomi’s redemption. Upon making her case to Boaz, he is faithful to fulfill the role of kinsman redeemer on Ruth and Naomi’s behalf. Like Ruth, the undocumented women laboring on farms across the country simply desire to provide for themselves and their families. Like her, they are willing to give up all they know and endure the treacherous journey to the US – a leap of faith that is fueled by their hope for a better future. Once they arrive, their stories do not usually end in the blessing Ruth experienced. Instead of welcome and hospitality, they find distrust, hatred, and abuse because they have no kinsman redeemer. Where is the Boaz of the church today? Like Ruth, undocumented farm workers can be a blessing – if only the church would take them in and love them as their own.

As this past weekend ended, Heath and I could only sum up how we felt in two words: Blown Away. This past weekend was our Adoption Auction. We had been planning it for many weeks (along with several other wonderful people). On Saturday it was finally here. In all we had over 70 items donated! What blew me away is where all of these donations came from: family, church friends, Bible study friends, friends from college, friends from middle school and strangers. It was unbelievable. I couldn't believe that people would be so generous.

One of the most striking things about the building is its materiality - it is tactile, physical, visceral, quite rough in places. And the forms are wild - the strict repetition of the cells and the corridors is set against the steep slope of the irregular pyramid roof of the small chapel, that seems to float in the courtyard. The vast oblong of the church sits between two chapels that bring light deep into the crypt, one is a sinuous bunker, with great funnels, the other a modest rectangle, with diamond shaped lightwells crashing diagonally into its roof. The glazed facades are articulated by an irregular rhythm of concrete vertical elements, a pattern developed by Le Corbusier's friend, composer and engineer, Iannis Xenakis. (The pair collaborated throughout the project, Le Corbusier was preoccupied with his work in Chandigarh, and left Xenakis in charge on site. Execution drawings we found in a plan chest were signed by Xenakis.) The rich and rough materiality and the experimental irregular forms are so striking because they go against the way Le Corbusiser's architecture was so often presented by tutors when I was studying. For years at school we learnt about his five points of architecture and modular studies, and great emphasis was placed on the whiteness, the cleanness, the pureness, the mechanical, the machine age, the uniformity, the prefabrication. Well all that seems to miss the point after 24 hours spent in La Tourette.

I also want to send out prayers to my Australian friends affected by the terrible cyclone they endured there and hoping that you all are well.

* In the town that I live in there is a speedway, about 2.5 miles from my house, where races are held several nights a week during the warmer months – stock cars, modified, trucks, you name it. One weekend in July there’s a huge race – the Oxford Plains 250 – that is very popular. About 10 days beforehand, campers start arriving in town and begin parking on any patch of ground within a mile of the speedway, including the fields on both sides and the edges of the parking lot. There are literally hundreds of them, and they’re everywhere. It’s like a little community (we call it Trailer Village) and the beer is a-flowin’. There’s no actual campground facilities, but the speedway opens their bathroom facilities to the folks. I have no idea what they do about showers (and I don’t want to know.) The traffic in town gets crazy and the police force of our little town has to work triple overtime. It’s happening this weekend, and I’m going to take a drive or a walk through and get some pictures – I’m hoping to find the guy who makes a hot tub out of the back of his pickup truck – he’s my favorite.

This is a yeasted bread with raisins. It is sweeter than bread, but not as sweet as cake. It is actually a Halloween tradition that was used as a fortune telling game. Inside the bread was baked a pea, a stick, a piece of cloth, a small coin, and a ring. If you had the piece with one of the items it meant something. The pea meant that the person would not marry in the year. The stick, "to beat one's wife with" meant that the person would have an unhappy marriage or continually be in disputes. The rag meant that one would have bad luck while the coin meant good luck or fortune. The ring meant that the person would be wed by December. At our feast we were told that there were only rings in the barm brack and to see who got it. Jemma dug through that bread like nobody's business and while she was looking away, the Fear an Ti slipped a ring onto her plate! She was ecstatic!!!

Many spinners seem to migrate to being plyers, spinning mostly 2-ply yarns. There are a special group who love singles, and spin many of them. There's the instant satisfaction of a single, the fact that you maximize your yardage-per-time. That trades off with the active twist it presents, and the need to control the drafting to get the thickness you want.

I begged my Mom to tell that story over and over again. And each time I wanted more details—Why did my Grandfather love kids? What did his laugh sound like? What time of year was it? Was he lying on the grass? Was he wearing an undershirt? Was it dirty? I was desperate for details. I loved the details. Ordinary details, but they made my Mom’s story about my Grandfather special.
Well, Jemma lost her second tooth today! She was eating Cheese Its in the car on the way to the doctor (pink eye) and said, "Mommy, I don't feel my wiggly tooth." I looked back and sure enough there was no tooth! She said, "Where is it?" I replied, "I bet you swallowed it!" Then we both cracked up! She thought this was pretty funny and assured me we could just write a note to the the tooth fairy! Oh my sweet baby!

THE IDEA of setting a minimum price per unit of alcohol has been widely touted as a means of reducing the level of alcohol-related problems in society, and at the same giving a boost to the pub trade. It has been adopted as the official policy of the devolved Scottish Government, and has been talked of sympathetically by David Cameron. But would it really deliver the benefits that are claimed for it?

Business ethics should be distinguished from the philosophy of business, the branch of philosophy that deals with the philosophical, political, and ethical underpinnings of business and economics. Business ethics operates on the premise, for example, that the ethical operation of a private business is possible — those who dispute that premise, such as libertarian socialists, (who contend that “business ethics” is an oxymoron) do so by definition outside of the domain of business ethics proper.

On the upside, Americans love to interact. They gladly enter conversation. They stop your daughter on the street to say they like her hair, or lack of it. They ask you where you got your shirt. They call you darling and honey. Sometimes their zeal gets the better of them, as with the man who woke me up on the flight from Albuquerque to Houston to ask if I'd ever flown United. Well intentioned, I am sure. Even headphones could not stop his heart surgery. On another flight, after a guy across from me complained to the stewardess for the fourth time about the way she phrased something(!), the guy behind me told him politely to shut up.
*If the pull of gravity on our bodies is so great, why doesn’t our skin puddle around our ankles as we near the end of life?

In actuality, skin just hangs loose in various places.
I want to believe in the next five to ten years that we will be operating in an industry of 50/50, digital/paper sales, but I just don't, certainly not for fiction.

The emerging “standard narrative” of the March 22 coup d’état in Mali, which until this month was considered one of West Africa’s model democracies, centers on the rebellion in Mali’s north. Smarting from the recent loss of their Amachach base to (mostly Tuareg) MNLA rebels, Malian troops demanded answers from their commanders and civilian leadership on Wednesday, March 21. When these answers proved unsatisfactory, the troops launched a mutiny that soon morphed into a full-blown putsch, toppling the country’s democratically elected president, Amadou Toumani Touré (known as “ATT”), who was due to step down this June after 10 years in office.

But nevertheless in Colombia there is not a daily order like in other countries. Every day is different and special. Especially the climate (four seasons during one day), the timetable of the busses and Transmilenios (TM) doesn’t work either and well, being late here in Colombia is kind of normal with this crazy infrastructure. But you always got to your objective somehow or somewhat. If you go by bus, sometimes someone is entering in the bus to earn some small money, so you can pass your time by listing to poems, self-written songs or life stories. But the busses don’t have their own lane on the streets, so with in the rush-hour-times it takes a long time to get to your place. For that reasons I’m taking most of my time the TM.

When I look at this page, I can see the facet of my personality that strikes a balance between the neatnik perfectionist and the free spirit. Somehow these two polar opposites compromise on a daily basis without causing utter chaos. I am simply amazed how coloring and ripping a few strips of paper can lead to so much self-awareness. Or a little thing called self-forgiveness.
There is something inherently wrong with my little blog popping up as the number one link when someone googles the phrase "famous AAPIs." Thankfully this is not the case when one types in the non-abbreviated phrase "Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders." But still... my little blog should not be anywhere near the top of this list. And it surely says a lot about our national education system's near failure to educate our youngest citizens about the historical and present-day contributions of Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.

I feel like I’m about to set out to climb Mount Everest. It is also a feeling I have had before, many times. I am about to begin the formal writing of a novel, and it is a bit daunting. What makes it so hard is that it isn’t a first draft, so I have lost the freedom of writing like a drunk driver, and must remember from day to day what I am saying, and try to stay between the lines.
Feeling very positive about transition. Not so much about work. I have proactive job, there is rarely a beginning, middle and end to anything I do. It has been hard to muster a lot of enthusiasm as the marketplace has been so unresponsive. Feeling a little too much like a zombie my self behind this desk. Hopefully I can regain my humanity over the weekend and fight back with new resolve Monday.

We all owe Shelley and Nathan, who reside in Austin, for hosting, with substantial assistance from the rest of the Texas relatives, Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Don, and Aunt Carol and Uncle John. Of course, the rest of us tried to help out, but the brunt of the coordination fell squarely on Shelly’s shoulders. Nathan endeared himself to the family by providing the best homemade venison and pork sausage, and fantastic grass-fed beef from his personal cow, in addition to his easy-going personality. We appreciated Louise protecting the environment by collecting all the recyclables after every meal, and for planning, with Mark, the next reunion in the Northeast. Scott regaled us with stories of his searches all over the world for WWII downed planes. We barely overlapped with Reid and Henrietta but were glad to see their smiling faces. Dan, Bryce and Nick showed up in the nick of time so we could hear stories of the Northwest settlers and tales of extreme humidity in H-Town. Steve and Karen, naturally, left with the minimum of time allotted for their drive to the San Antonio airport, Steve relying on his car racing background to achieve maximum efficiency within the limits of the law. We also remembered those not present, including those who couldn’t make the trip, and those who departed this earth prematurely. They were with us in spirit, and their memories live on in the Deaver clan, ever a part of the big Texas landscape.

Jo said that she had already read this book three or four times, and she will probably do it again, because although the narrator is so repellant - pompous, self-centred, utterly misanthropic (he refers to 'golliwog' hair and expresses his distaste for 'queers' and his view of women is pretty unreconstructed) and without moral sense (his view of pity is as the only permissible version of the urge to give weak things a good hard shake) - she found it so very beautifully written. We all agreed that the prose, for which Banville is famous, is indeed striking: beautifully modulated sentences and stunning visual descriptions making the whole extremely visually vivid, (including in this case repeated descriptions of the quality of sunlight that one critic has acutely pointed out aptly chimes with the Dutch masters' preoccupation with light), though peppered throughout with archaic vocabulary - he uses words like bespeaks, tarried and athwart - and others requiring reference to a dictionary. Elegant is the word I'd use for this prose, and this is Freddie's prose purportedly, since this is his confession: elegant, sensitive, educated; fastidious yet lush.

If the council was willing to set a 'needs budget' - a budget based on the needs of the area, rather than based on the forced cuts budgets of central government, then they would easily gain mass support - and rightfully so from whole sections of working class people in the area. This is exactly what happened when the Liverpool council did this in the 1980s. If the council was to do this then the Socialist Party would through it full weight behind the councillors to defend them and the budget from attack.

He knew instinctively that she wasn’t that way. He couldn’t be absolutely sure, of course, but he’d bet on it.

It still feels like Harris is simply wrapping up the entire series, though, based on the last half of the book. With characters’ lives leading particular ways and Sookie feeling the slow burn of her oncoming 30s, it seems pretty obvious Harris is trying to fit everyone (and I do mean all characters, even ones we haven’t seen in several books) into their little boxes with prepared endings for the last book.

I personally think the impact Cavern of Souls will have on Standard, if nothing else, is greatly exaggerated but I can’t honestly tell exactly how much of an impact the card will actually have at this point. I haven’t played much with the card yet nor are there decklists from tournaments out yet when I’m writing this to draw conclusions from. The jury is still out on how much Cavern of Souls will actually do.

My father was the youngest of 5 born into a very strict Pentecostal family. He once told me that, by the time he was 15, he'd attended enough church to last him the rest of his life, so he stopped going--much to the chagrin of his deacon father. My mother was raised in a Methodist household that attended church during major religious holidays, but not much during the rest of the year. Neither of them ever guided me in a religious direction as I grew up.

Though companies are trying to celebrate the inherent soft skills of female leaders, women often have to try to compensate for the “softness” of our sex by trying to be more “masculine” or “assertive” and playing by the men’s rules, instead of creating our own. I remember a women’s forum I attended, in which it explained how men tend to have different habits than women and communicate in different ways. For example, a man asserts his power by dominating over as much space as possible, even on the board room table. The female speaker said that now, when she sits down for a meeting, she spreads her papers, pens and other personal belongings as far around her space as possible, to show her confidence. It makes me feel a bit sad to see this, but it definitely rings true. If you work in an area dominated by men, you are entering their territory and playing by their rules. I have met more and more men that are learning how to tailor their leadership styles to different people and work styles, trying to understand the cues not only of gender but also of culture. However, there are still industries, careers and organizations where it can be a struggle to be different.

At first, the way Sara became my agent gave me hope that that might actually happen. I moved to New York City on June 1st for a summer internship, and that very day I got my full request from Sara—and a representation offer from another agent. A few days later, Sara made an offer, too. After those months of rejected queries, I was beyond elated. I admit it: I felt pretty cool. Sara and I agreed to meet for lunch in Soho to talk about my book, and writing that lunch down in my planner gave me a “could I be a real writer now?” tingle. I couldn’t quite believe it was happening, but nonetheless, I wanted to be ready.

My daughter is one of the middle children, being in between 2 boys who absolutely hate anything "girly"! Anyway, this was fun for her and I. Initially I wanted to find paper dolls online and cut it with my Cricut but I found out quickly that my Cricut doesn't like to cut felt without special preparation or at least higher quality wool felt. The stuff that I have is NOT of the highest quality so we resorted to the old way of doing things....ya know, with scissors. *GASP* Who does THAT anymore?

The good news is that this fair trade, organic chocolate is REALLY tasty stuff. And let's face it, if you pay more, you're probably going to eat less. Rather than scarfing down a fifty cent Hershey bar and having to wonder if the cocoa was harvested by mistreated children, I can spent $3-$4 on a fair trade bar, and slowly eat one or two squares, then wrap it up to enjoy later. It's easier on the waistline and easier on my conscious. My wallet doesn't even take that big of a hit because I'm spending about the same amount, just getting less chocolate. Recently, I've become a fan of Theo Chocolate and Equal Exchange chocolate. Milk chocolate varieties are my favorite, I tend to steer clear of dark chocolate. My husband likes dark chocolate though, so I've tried those out too. I believe it's simply because the cocoa content is higher, but the dark chocolate version of these brands have more of a coffee undertone to them than a regular Hershey's Dark bar. I have also tried Endangered Species chocolate and didn't like it quite as much...the milk chocolate varieties taste more like dark chocolate to me. I've heard rave reviews about Dagoba too.

This is not to say that Embassytown is a bad novel. It is not, but neither is it a good one. It has too many common flaws that could have been eradicated by a more ruthless editorial process in the writing, or even more simply by an extra draft of the manuscript. Nor does it suggest that Miéville is a poor or failing writer: he is obviously not, but unless he is told in clear terms that he is under-achieving, that he is restricting his art by depending too heavily on genre commonplaces, he will never write the great novels that many people say he is capable of.

Since we had arrived in London, I witnessed, first hand, the expression "stiff upper lip".
“A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States. An individual mandate would have two features that, in combination, would make it unique. First, it would impose a duty on individuals as members of society. Second, it would require people to purchase a specific service that would be heavily regulated by the federal government.”

In the interview, there is a revealing discussion of the need to copyright a Bible translation.

For a major project that may be incurring costs for 5-10 years before any revenue is realized, it is easy to see that a commitment from a major publishing house is required.
Two Saturdays ago, I went and visited my Grandpa in the rehab center that he has been staying at for almost a month now. I am so grateful that I went and visited him. I can't begin to tell you how great it was to talk to him and have an hour or so alone-one on one. I talked to him about newly married life. How I really live in the country now and how I love it. We talked about our chickens and ducks and showed him pictures of them. We also talked about how me and my siblings swam in the pool and played in the field at his house with our cousins. I had some of the best times at his house. I told him I always had a good time when I visited. I think it made him feel good to hear that.

NASOH was founded in 1973 to provide a forum for maritime history and remains actively devoted to the study and promotion of naval and maritime history. The society’s objectives are to promote the exchange of information among its members and others interested in the history of the seas, lakes, and inland waterways; to call attention to books, articles, and documents pertinent to naval and maritime history; and to work with local, regional, national, international, and government organizations toward the goal of fostering a more general awareness and appreciation for North America’s naval and maritime heritage.

I first grew a beard when I was 14. With the exception of a brief period at the end of my freshman year and a play I shaved for senior year, I had a beard all through high school. I enjoyed the look, and also found that it was morally useful. When you're tall, relatively mature, and bearded in high school, people question your decisions less. Don't drink alcohol? You're obviously doing so out of genuine conviction and not fear of punishment, or you'd be out passing for 21+ and buying for everyone (at a reasonable service fee).

To celebrate this glorious day, I'm busting out a very special beer which I've been saving in my very crowded beer fridge. It's a Dogfish Head - Midas Touch. Yes I know, it's so good! Sam is amazing. I'm enjoying it very much. More than that cheap ass Dahrma Beer that Sawyer drinks in his little cabin on his weird, time traveling island. I don't care how thirsty I was, or what you offered me. I would refuse to give up beer here in the world we live, to go to freakin island. What the hell were Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid thinking? They knew there wasn't good beer there, yet they all went back. Idiots!
Thousands of Catholic clergy and religious have raped and sodomized tens of thousands of children—perhaps more than 100,000 children—since 1950. These crimes were committed in secret, and bishops nurtured that secrecy. Nearly 15,000 survivors have broken through the silence, and their accounts have created an in-depth picture of the crisis….

The idea is to take a break from food. It is really like fasting – where you wouldn’t eat ANY food – except of course we can’t do that for 16 weeks. It’s called OptiFAST, and not just because it works fast. Religions use fasting to focus our minds away from earthly things like meal preparation and eating, onto other things, “higher matters.” On the Optifast diet we are taking a break from all those day-to-day food-related activities to focus on forging a new relationship between food and ourselves. So we are consuming the minimum just to keep us going and keep our bodies OK nutritionally. One group leader says that Phase 1 is like erasing the blackboard and starting over, putting all the unhealthy foods, choices and behaviors behind us.
Peel Session collections always hold a special place in my music collection, this is one of the best actually, always a favourite of Peel this collects Polly Jean Harveys sessions together and makes a pretty credible album.

What annoys me most of all is that upon being labelled a racist, you immediately refuted the claim and provided incontrovertible evidence of the opposite being true. Why wasn’t that the end of it? I too have Oriental help and, like you, am very fond of them. I like to give them a little slap on the buttocks as they clean my bidet in the home cinema and sometimes bow to them as they’re leaving for the day and say “ah so” as a show of cultural solidarity. I also found Mickey Rooney’s turn as Mr Fukkamoto (or whatever his name was) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s exceptionally funny, not because he ridicules Chinese/Japanese people, turning them into a preposterous caricature, but because he inhabits the role and brings out the inherent humanity of those two races. Why couldn’t people accept your affection for Asians on face value and move on? (Maybe next time mention Mickey Rooney.)

Myths and Realities of Smokefree England already has the makings of a fascinating historical document. With one or two possible exceptions that can be argued over, all of the so-called 'myths' have turned out to be true and all of ASH's 'realities' have turned out to be myths. And it took less than 3 years.Now, I've pointed out a few glaring errors myself over the years, they're not hard to spot. Sadly, no-one in government - who pay this 'charity', remember - have bothered to pull them up on any of it.
So Monday I took my car in for its 100,000 mile tune-up. No real problems, got new front brakes but everything else was okay...except the radio, which apparently was faulty and thus not the speakers' fault for the lack of audio in the car. About $750. Wednesday, my insulin pump wasn't hooked up right, so I ducked out around 11 to go home and re-attach it. That's when I got smashed into. The lady tried to cross two lanes of traffic to pull into a parking lot for a diner. The left lane was all stopped at a traffic light, about 10 cars deep, so someone must have given her a gap to go. The right lane, the turning land for the onramp to the highway, was clear, so I was still moving at about 20-25 mph approaching the light. So she didn't look for me, and I didn't see her until she cut me off ("failure to yield", a 14-242 apparently). No injuries at such a slow speed. Just a real hassle. And of course, maintenance costs aren't usually reimbursed by an insurer -- her Geico is going to give me $300 to offset that a little. But anyways, the car's being totaled. I had to go retrieve everything from the body shop they towed it to -- license plates, my E-Z Pass tag, sporting goods, sunglasses....the only thing left at this point might be to try to siphon the 2/3 tank of gas into a portable container that we can use for the lawn mower. I'm amused at referring to her as an "old lady", as she's a few weeks younger than my parents.

The Brigade from UC Irvine was set up in the village’s old three room schoolhouse and in a new school under construction from the Architecture Brigades. This day was actually rather quiet. Not that many people showed to attend the clinic. As we learned, in the weeks prior to a Medical Brigade clinic, GB staff visit several communities surrounding the clinic location and coordinate which day the community will attend the clinic. Town A on Day 1, Town B on Day 2 and so forth. And this day just so happened to be slower than the others. Several dozen patients. But we learned afterwards, the UCI Medical Brigade treated more than 800 patients during their three-day clinic.

After that, we worked with modeling clay. First they sketched out ideas of what they wanted to do in clay. After their juices were flowing, they build lovely things like this alligator. We set them up under a lamp and darkened the room so they could see the shadows on their pieces, and they drew them again - so they could remember! Tons of fun. Hard to get them out of the classroom once our time was up.

I was “written up” yet again by a manager for working 3 minutes past my shift. I wasn’t being over-zealous–I actually thought my shift ended at 2:30pm, not 2pm. I was so frustrated with myself and the way my brain read the numbers on the schedule. I’ve been chastised several times by management for similar faux-pas. (once I came to work and hour early by mistake, but they were glad that day because they needed extra staff.)
In a time when the Beatles ruled the world and the Rolling Stones were a close second, Led Zeppelin was rising to fame, and bands such as Yes, Queen, Journey, and Black Sabbath were about to take over the airwaves. These bands were driven by the will of their managers to produce chart topping songs and record selling albums. However, with the exception of bands like Led Zeppelin, they lacked much ingenuity in their live performances.

Our original plan was to turn in the rental car yesterday and then drive the Trek to the Wild Horse Sanctuary and stay on one of their RV pads for a couple nights. Anyway, we had to ditch this because of the delay in getting the Trek repaired. So we extended the car rental and paid for a couple additional nights at TeePee Campground & RV Park. If nothing else, we've learned to be flexible!
Rediscovered in the late 1980s, her work has not only expanded our understanding of the Surrealist era but also serves as an important touchstone to later feminist explorations of gender and identity politics. In her self-portraits, which she began creating around 1913, Cahun dismantled and questioned preexisting notions of self and sexuality. Posing in costumes and elaborate make-up, Cahun appears masked as various personae: man or woman, hero or doll, both powerful and vulnerable. Almost a century after their making, these innovative photographs and assemblages remain remarkably relevant in their treatment of gender, performance, and identity.
But that added car payment is going to be an adjustment for us. We have to save as much as possible especially in the next two months because the payments are bigger for the first two months. I know we can afford it, it’s just a matter of us actually saving what we can. We have the money, we just usually spend it on things like dinner out, or breakfast, lunch and dinner out. We are that bad sometimes.
Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index (including returns from dividends) rose 4.39% from January through March. However, the index trailed many of its global counterparts. Canadian shares were held back by volatility in prices for commodities such as oil and base metals. Gold stocks were also volatile as the price of bullion fluctuated. Consequently, the materials sector gained just 0.19% while the energy sector fell slightly, by 0.49%. Together, these sectors account for close to half of the index.

In the last chapter of their paper the authors offer several explanations of this phenomenon. One of them is the observation that the apparent drastic under-estimation of the degree of inequality seems to reveal a lack of awareness of the size of the gap. This is something that Data Visualization and interactive charts can help address. For example, Catherine Mulbrandon’s Blog Visualizing Economics does a great job in that regard.
Then came Fantastic Friday and though Montano delivered two technically proficient performances (his voice was hoarse though and he resorted to bellowing, but then so did most of the competition), it was clear that he didn’t have as much audience support as he used to command in his pre-competition days. Montano would go on to cop not one, but both titles, as most people suspected; and now in the minds of most, Montano, for all his obvious talent and mastery of the musical form has sunk to the position of Government Stooge in the eyes of many. HE is in bed with government it seems, and willing to sell his social capital in exchange for real liquidity. So the PP Govt is reliant on his fan base to remain popular, populist and relevant. But the tides are turning for both HD and the Govt…

However, I refuse to race change Effy – have have too many stories and too much emotion invested in her as a Draenei.

Dempsey's, in the former Bud Light Warehouse Bar, will be open on a limited basis starting Friday for Opening Day, with a full opening planned in late April. The restaurant will then be open year-round on game days and non-game days.

I keep trusting that God knows best and praying that one day I’ll have the family I yearn for so deeply. God promises us in Jeremiah 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” I believe that God gives us the desires of our hearts, if we’re patient and seek his will.

And it isn’t only in relation to Islam or the study of Islam, but with religions in general. Let’s look at some of the term used in context of Judaism, being ‘Mosaic,’ ‘Judaic,’ ‘Jew,’ ‘Jewish,’ and so on. For example, when one is ‘Jewish,’ one is not necessarily a Jew, while you perfectly can be a Jew without being particular ‘Jewish’ (I know a lot of those guys). ‘Jewish’ here is an adjective about something that appears to be, well, Jewish, that is, something that would give you the idea that it is connected to the culture or faith of the Jews. Judaism as well is a confusing term at times, not always relating what exactly we are talking about. Therefore we today, at least in the study of Judaism, talk about ‘Rabbinical Judaism,’ ‘Karaite Judaism,’ ‘Post-Temple Judaism,’ and so on. Judaism is simply to broad a term to use, in order to render any clear meaning of it, unless you are aware of the context you are reading it in. By that I mean, if you are reading a book on Judaism written by a rabbi, then you can be fairly sure that what he means when he writes ‘Judaism,’ that is what is called ‘Rabbinical Judaism,’ the part of Judaism based on the Rabbinical writings (Mishnah, Talmud, Midrashim, etc.) and Rabbinical teachings. Reading an academic article on some subject related to the study of Judaism, the author normally tends to be more precise, and at least explain what his focus is, as well of which group he is talking about.

Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Massachusetts), who is also sponsoring the amendment, recently said, “I’ve introduced a People’s Rights Amendment, which is very simple and straightforward.

It treats all corporations, including incorporated unions and nonprofits, in the same way, as artificial creatures of the state that we, the people, govern, not the other way around.”

It has a sweet cocoa taste that fits as a cocoa porter, but it's lighter in body than a porter, which fits as a winter warmer. I don't know, personally it feels like a chocolate bock, because it has a hint of a lager taste with a malty, heavy lager feel. Either way, I like it. It doesn't fit neatly into any single pigeon hole, like beer nerds like to cram each and every beer into, but it's a darker beer with solid flavor and a light feel. It's not often that that combination works out.

I had a craving for pasta alfredo the other day. Unfortunately, I had no ham or bacon at home. All I had was 1/4 kg of stir-fried beef strips, thanks to our 4th attempt at copying the beef dish from our favorite Japanese restaurant.

So, to save it from getting dumped into the garbage bin, my Beloved told me to resurrect the beef strips in another form that the children could digest with happy faces.

Second, we must realize what is at stake. Marriage is first and foremost a public institution. It has always been so. Throughout history, societies have granted special recognition and privileges to marriage because it is the central organizing institution of human culture. Marriage regulates relationships, sexuality, human reproduction, lineage, kinship, and family structure. But marriage has also performed another crucial function – it has regulated morality.

You know, Keel pointed that out in one of his books—he’s talking about gravity. We don’t even know what gravity is. You can’t even define gravity, even in terms of electro-magnetic parameters. And he says the only thing that counteracts gravity is the human mind. He gave account of his own witnessing of levitations. And it’s real obvious that probably some of these ancient cultures were able to utilize that in their monument building, some kind of levitational, anti-gravitational force, using their minds.

The Levites are now standing up and praise God. They speak of how he created the world and all that is in it, he was meticulous about it.

Well, last night there were about 10 of them at 9:00 out in the road in front of my cottage (of course) having a screaming, threatening fight. This is how gun shots get fired. I seriously am worried about my safety. So I called my landlord and told her I am considering not signing a new lease.

We actually had to rip out the floor to make it stronger to support the weight of the new boiler position and the two machines and also it was a good opportunity to run the under floor heating into this area too.

The spa is described as an “urban oasis”, and it didn’t fail to deliver… only it was in an older historic property with dark wood and antique furniture.. so it kind of felt more like some rich dude’s study than a spa.

And that's all it takes. I fleetingly consider refusing, but the truth is, I don't want this to stop, so I position my arms behind my head and grab my elbows, wincing just a bit at the conspicuousness of the pose but also loving the way it makes my tits jut forward. It makes me feel sexy, and helpless, and there's no more hesitation. I'm right there with you, ready for my fate, St. Sebastian waiting for the sting of the first arrow.
I have to wonder, as I settle in to blog for the last time about an artist whose work I used to enjoy, if her solo album and its accompanying video visualettes and photo book were a reflection of her mission post-The Dresden Dolls: namely, to destroy the woman and artist she was, and replace her with a new (but not improved) version. It seems fitting that she does not, per se, ask us who killed Amanda Palmer, but almost states it, as in, “she who killed Amanda Palmer.”
Trans-Siberian Orchestra took off before their was even a Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Maybe it was denial by the general public but they just did not want to accept that the cool heavy rock sounding Christmas song was played by a band named Savatage. Regardless of names, the public loved the song: Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24) and mainstream radio added it into their holiday play lists.
Stopping me nine times, without a single moving violation is starting to irritate me just a little bit. Especially when I spent my entire lunch break paying bills, and had barely enough time to grab a coke at the gas station before getting pulled over. Maybe it’s karma coming back to get me since I went my entire sophomore year of college without tags or an inspection sticker, until my dad swiped my car one day and got it all stickered-up for my first real job! I don’t know how I got away with that, but it sure did give me the false impression that if you’re basically doing all the right things, the world will cut you a little slack. It definitely does not happen like that… There’s a lesson learned the hard way!
Then there are the people who are always right there, regardless of who else is...the people who can be front and center sometimes and other times they fade into the background, but they are still there, ready to jump forward if you stumble.

My Big Fat Independent Movie Movie On Internet
Ndebele was in another car with a police-colonel. Ndebele then walked over to constable Kok's car, took the keys from the police vehicle's ignition and climbed back into her own car with the colonel. Constable Kok then went to Brig Ndebele's vehicle asking for her keys back as her police-dog was not allowed to remain alone in the vehicle.
The exercises were silly- telling the funniest story ever in total jibberish, consuming and throwing imaginary laughter pills at one another, operatic laughing, etc. It reminded me of drama exercises, which I enjoyed back in the day. But I didn’t know these women. And I felt silly. And wondered if I was being judged. And in fact was judging myself and others around me. It would be less awkward, perhaps, with more participants, but… it was awkward. BUT… I think this means I need to stick with it, for at least a few more weeks, because if I want to die to judgment… this is a good place to practice.
So I thought I would share my first project of 2012, a card for my Dad, whose birthday is this month. He's an old rocker (he got an air guitar for Christmas. Yes you can buy them, that's not a joke, I know they are supposed to be invisible, lol) so I thought these old stickers I have had lying around for a while would suit him perfectly!

Amid all this ruminating and cultural confusion, a trip to a restaurant in Westwood's 'Tehrangeles' quarter called Cafe Glacé -- a phrase that fills me with nostalgia -- that serves something called Persian pizza -- a concept I didn't know existed -- fits right in. I've waxed sentimental about Persian cuisine (all over this blog, for one thing) for ages. But what I know of it is what came with us to the United States over 30 years ago: the food cooked at home, the traditional dishes of rice, heady spices, tangy fruits, and grilled meats passed down from mother to daughter in humble family kitchens.

And as is common when we get easterly weather sweeping in off the steppes we are getting a number of interesting visiting birds, I've had fieldfares in the garden, stripping the remains of the rosehips, and cormorants and goosanders have been driven up from the frozen estuary onto the deeper water of the river inland. One of the photos here is of an almost Japanese print-like shot of one of these cormorants trying to dry his wings. The other two are of cardoon seedheads, in the artichoke family, covered in snow, and icicles hanging down below one of the town's bridges.

Good morning, y'all! You know what's awesome? Taking a couple days just to lay around and recharge. Of course, now I'm going "WHY DID I DO THAT I'M SO BEHIND ON REVISIONS/BLOGS/EVERYTHIIIIIING," so there's also that. So I thought I'd get the October Horror Blogfest back on track by talking about the relationship between horror and verbal storytelling.

They piled the sheets up in a well-ordered stack, and the professor clamped them securely together. The whole they covered with a box or sort of cover constructed of pure fused quartz, so well fused and treated that it was practically clear of all flaws or blemishes. Jerry straightened up, cast about with his laughing blue eyes, and finally went over to where a rather large machine stood mounted on a set of wheels, much like the carriage of a movable X-ray apparatus. The machine itself resembled a violet ray machine with a large bulb of cherry-red clear glass superimposed upon its top. This bulb seemed to have five electric connections shaped much like the anode reflector in an X-ray machine. In fact, the five-fingered affair looked as though it might be a freak Roentgen ray generator, the excess anodes giving higher power, perhaps. The blunt ends of the anti-cathodes were exceptionally peculiar in this large tube -- there seemed to be no end! There was no hole, or was there a visible surface. That the anode rod was solid could be proved by feeling the end, but all attempts to see any surface resulted in a sort of confusing impression of void space.
Okay, so this isn't really a DIY but it was another step in the right direction for our master bedroom.

The story telling is so subtle that unless the reader has at least some knowledge of the history of the Balkans you’ll think you are reading about a tiger. Not since my immersion into mid-twentieth century American literature have I been able to see more than a story within a novel. Not only did I find the story engrossing, I also gained insight into the problems incurred in the Balkans during the last half of the twentieth century. Obreht is truly a talented writer.
My family and I have now moved into temporary housing in California. I am missing my old home and my friends terribly, but I am loving this CA warmth. We won't get our household stuff (and my scrapbook stuff ) until mid November. I am having weird withdrawal symptoms, but I am really excited because the home we will eventually move into will be walking distance to JoAnn's!
I like all kinds of stuff. And I am constantly finding new stuff to add to my already growing list of “things that I want”, which totally doesn’t help and makes it really hard to save for those big-ticket items when you find so many smaller things to buy instead.

And then I realized what was bothering me. Beinart’s sympathy for someone else’s son, the expression that he “could have been my son” – it’s not manly. It’s the sort of thing a woman would say. And that gives some people license to discount everything that follows.
Mr A and I went out last week. Together, into town, to a comedy gig. This hasn't happened for, let's say, two years? Although perhaps in that time we might have been to Warwick Arts Centre, but I don't remember.

We've all been there - sitting in the chair at the nail salon in front of your entire neighborhood (or so it feels like) - getting our brows done, when the nice Asian lady asks, "You want your lip done too?"

This version of the affair between the emperor and his beloved ephebe vindicates the youth scorned by early Christian church fathers as a “shameless and scandalous boy” and “sordid and loathsome instrument of his master’s lust.” EROMENOS envisions the personal history of the young man who achieved apotheosis as a pagan god of antiquity, whose cult of worship lasted for hundreds of years—far longer than the cult of the emperor Hadrian.

Another interesting piece of information about Barter Books is that it was here that the now ubiquitous “Keep Calm and Carry On” poster was rediscovered. The poster was designed during WWII, like so many others (e.g. “Make Do and Mend”, “Careless Talk Costs Lives”, etc), but apparently it was decided that this particular one should be put aside in case of a more severe emergency, such as enemy invasion or occupation. As this eventuality didn’t occur, the slogan was never used and was eventually forgotten. In 2000 a rare copy of one of these posters turned up in a box of books donated to Barter Books. The owners put it on display and it attracted such interest that they commissioned facsimile copies to put on sale in their shop, and with that a craze was spawned.

Taxation
By accepting this offer, I have allowed, into my life, respect, from others... and accepted their confidence, in me, that I can perform the job. How many opportunities will I receive, through the remainder of my years, when someone will offer me something that alters the course of my life, for all time? ... well, at least till the next stage of my life steps in. There's always something, just when you think you've mastered it. Next step, move on. Or stay in place, the choice is always ours, or so it seems. This was something that was never going to happen, in that previous job scenario. No respect, and certainly never chosen. Not that I wanted to be chosen, but it seems to indicate an even higher level of respect being given, and I could use some of that, given my previous experience of "running with the pack". I consider that I was running with the pack when I didn't have the foresight to move on. If I refused this chance, I would be admitting defeat, and letting "life" (past experience)keep beating me down. Largely, I would be refusing the chance to Chart and Navigate my own course, for smooth sailing... instead of being like the wildly tossed raft, that I had always been, seemingly lost at sea, and with one hole fast leaking.

He (yes, it is a he) needed some love as you can see. He had a broken leg (which I repaired before taking this picture) and those horrible handles needed to be removed, and holes filled. It was a shame that I had to fill holes, because I would have liked to have kept the wood grain showing. Anyhow, once all the repairs were made, I sanded the entire piece, and sanded off the old paint. I didn't have quite the color I wanted on hand so I mixed up a few colors and created a peacock blue. I painted the entire piece, distressed it lightly, waxed it, added sparkly new knobs, and voila!

Being from Utah I was pretty skeptical that Missouri could throw out a storm that amounted to much snow. I was very wrong. Although, from what I understand this is quite unusual. The big storm was supposed to hit last Tuesday. They let the kids out of school early on Monday (which I laughed about) and canceled school Tuesday. I thought that was hilarious because Tuesday morning was cloudy but there was no storm. I kept looking out the window thinking how ridiculous this all was. Well, about tenish it started to snow lightly and was windy out. By noon I had to admit that there was a downright blizzard going on outside. The snow was coming down in all every directions. It was crazy. It kept coming and coming. I realized at one point that we were snowed in and was grateful we had everything we needed. I was grateful for our warm home and I was praying that our electricity wouldn't go out.
Yeah, that’s a sour cream container. If your short on these, let me know. I have 65 billion of these.
However, outside Russia the class war was abandoned when the white working classes failed to play the role allotted to them and joined the middle classes as targets for destruction. Race became the new weapon in undermining a culture through national guilt. Anti-racism aimed exclusively at the target race and intent upon instilling a sense of shame and guilt for a past which had, in fact never taken place, exploited a weakness within a tolerant and benevolent people always anxious to do the right thing and protect the underdog. As a consequence, the dishonest drum beat of “white oppressor”, “black victim” accompanied by the altogether more sensuous “black sexy”, “white surrender” became the constant theme music behind popular culture, throughout the 1960's, 70's and 80's.

With the exception of Kim Yun Jin and Daniel Dae Kim, the Korean scenes were unnecessarily overdramatic. Plus, I usually had to explain to friends that the English subtitles sometimes left out certain details like Sun cursing at… I think, it was her dad?)
By now my little girl and wife have usually made it downstairs. Sipping from big cups of Café au Laits, my wife and I rush to get the hot bowls of couche-couche to the table. My wife always pours Steen’s syrup on hers, while I prefer two sprinkled on tablespoons of very refined table sugar. All three of us look forward to that magical moment when the couche-couche is sweet and hot and the milk ice cold, and rushing we each swallow the first several spoonfuls because we know soon everything will be tepid and mushy in our bowls.
After nearly 20 years of “Choose or Lose,” MTV is changing the name of its election season campaign. The youth cable channel’s coverage will be labeled “Power of 12,” a nod to both the election year and the notion that 18- to 29-year-olds have a lot of political power if they choose to wield it. The name change is, in part, a statement about the cynical mood of the youth voting bloc. While young people turned out in unusually high numbers to support Barack Obama in 2008, MTV’s research into “Choose or Lose” found that many felt they had lost anyway. “They were so passionate,” said Stephen K. Friedman, the president of MTV. “And then they hit this wall of the economy.” RTWT.

My aunt lived her life in the healthiest way that she knew how, filled with vitamins and meditation, years of being a vegetarian, etc. I remember a conversation I had with her years ago, in which she exclaimed, "I wish I had eaten more cookies!!" Now, she meant this in the most literal sense possible, but it can also be translated as a statement to advise all of us to live life to the fullest.
Inside I was applauding enthusiastically — “Good dog, ohhh, good DOG!” He had deeply inspired me! It was so raw and so real that I couldn’t help but wonder how amazing it was that I’ve found my own purpose in life, and now I help other people pop out of a stack of plastic bottles, beaming with joy because they’re found theirs!

Once your dog is no longer barking with a leash correction in front of many different dogs (or window distractions), take the leash off and repeat some more. You are now teaching your dog that it cannot bark even with the leash off. Now is the time to use auditory or physical corrections (snap your fingers, say “ah-ah”, block your dog from getting closer to its target, use “the touch“, etc). It will make much more sense to your dog if you come between them and the thing you are barking–do not try to call them away. Another note: if you have more than one dog that is an obsessive barker, target the stronger one/instigator. Whenever you have two dogs, one is the leader and one is the follower. By correcting the leader/instigator first, the follower will calm down too.

The most recent one was about Lazy Magnolia's Indian Summer Spiced Ale. They really like it. But what struck me most was, when Paul Leone talks about how great it is that there are more choices for summer beers by craft brewers now, he admits to once drinking Miller Lite during the warmer months. Of course, he knew, even before uttering the words, that he was out of line.

A friend of mine recently had a baby and I asked if i could take some photos of her sweet bubba. Its always something i had wanted to do and never had a really decent camera when mine were this little. Sweet MacKenna is 3 weeks old and he was the most perfect bubba.

The feeling of an impossibly tiny hand grasping my finger with the grip of a wrestler........
First off, I want to wish you all a VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS (though late it may be...). We had a very small, quiet Christmas...as quiet as can be with 2 teenagers and an 8 yr. old....It was our first Christmas in 12 years without being with extended family. The girls didn't realize how much they would miss it, but poor Jess broke down in tears (this from our thick-skinned 17 yr. old). We made-do and I had the privilege of cooking my first ever Christmas dinner! It turned out better than I expected and I got rave reviews from some tough critics, so I'm chalking it up to a successful one! I had some BIG shoes to fill between my step-mom's and mother-in-law's cooking...but I'd say it was a good start!
Wow, that's hard. I can't say anything, so far, is a huge achievement. My business is growing steadily and every day brings new vistas. I'm definitely far from saturating the market!

How it works: It's free. Bring extra seeds and/or seedlings (gardening wisdom too) to swap or share with other gardeners. Heirloom varieties are encouraged (for seed saving potential). That includes: food crops, herbs, flowers, shrubs, trees, native plants, etc. Hybrid seeds and plants can also be shared. Label plants/seeds with variety name, special instructions, and your name, and bring baggies/envelopes to divvy up seeds. Bring a lawn chair , too! If you do not have seeds or plants to swap, come and mingle with gardeners and farmers informally sharing insights on gardening.
I kept my eyes open for my blogosphere friends. I got a tap on the shoulder and it was Julie! It was so nice to finally meet her in person. She also introduced me to Derrek another local blogger. She did great despite the freezing weather! I looked for Bobbi, but with the crazy sea of people I didn't see her. I took a peek at her blog to see how she did and she had one hell of a PR! I ran into a bunch of other people that I knew as well. This is a huge event and it is fun to take part in any way. I may just have to do it again next year.
I can hear the least of these

Those with a public profile are on message because of the "aspirational" adoption of elite orthodoxy by the middle class. This is why it is an “Ideological Caste” - you can only belong if you conform, and you have no career if you think for yourself. Sin is no longer wrong behaviour but wrong thinking - those who err are persecuted and subject to public humiliation.

In continuation from where it picked off, the typical weak guy-getting-stronger plot continues. While I had no idea of what was going to come next from the basic plot of this show, I am left astounded by the fact that there’s more to this. Kuroyukihime told him the previous day to never turn on the globalnet. This may be because entering the Accelerated World means meeting challengers. It’s a great concept, and I don’t know how well it works in “shattering reality” as what was previous said by Kuroyukihime, but overall, it gets that tingly feeling of excitement, especially the cliffhanger at the ending.
Then, too, like oxygen, all life on Planet Earth is dependent on CO2, a gas that the Environmental Protection Agency is actually calling a “pollutant.” That is so absurd that I was confident people would laugh the whole “theory” out the door when it was first proposed. But that was over two decades ago.

The issues that may arise on the part of the kids are quite expected because they are kids and they are not yet acquainted with so much about life hence, they are not yet matured enough to understand things that are going on around them especially in complex situations which may involve psychological and emotional pressures. Certain circumstances that happen among grown ups usually brings about confusion to young minds, it generates more questions rather than answers. That is why they usually go by what initially comes to their mind before accepting other possibilities. But this is only reasonable on the part of the kids. This is an irrational behavior on the part of the new partner. Though it may not seem so astonishing to find individuals who despite the knowledge that their partner has kids of their own with someone else before them, yet are still willing to get into the relationship hoping that everything will just work out fine, it is still a wonder if whether or not they are truly aware of what they are getting into. Love conquers all, they say. If it is not too much love, sometimes the fact that you happen to find someone who is a good catch that is just within your reach, you tend to overlook other details because you want that person badly to be yours that you are convinced that you can just overlook all the flaws; there are others who are overwhelmed by their attraction to the person that they have underestimated the weight of the person’s excess luggage which little do they know they will have to share in carrying if the relationship pushes through. Sadly, deliberately ignoring the obvious for selfish reasons often creates an unfavorable outcome for all parties concerned, such as the uncomfortable position as much as feelings given a situation where they all meet and have to share a common space. For someone who is clueless with what entails in a relationship with someone who already has kids, it is a bit troublesome but depending on the character and personality of the person it can either be adaptable or a red light. Be it known that no matter how important you are in your partner’s life, you have to be aware that you share his/her attention with his/her kids. Though you may complain and demand but you are not to expect that it will be met just the way you wanted. For instance with regards to time allocation, you can not expect to have all his/her time with you alone. Other than he/she has a career, it is also important for him/her to allocate time for the kids. It is normal if time with the kids comes first because that is part of his/her obligation as a parent especially during the developmental stages of a child where parental guidance is crucial. It is different if the kids are all grown-up and matured enough to be on their own. But until then, time with the kids is important in rearing them to make them better and responsible individuals in society. In terms of finances, parental obligation includes financial responsibility to provide for the kid’s necessities. You should be aware that being a parent is a lifetime responsibility, it is a 24-hour, 7 days a week duty without any expected compensation and benefits. However, it shouldn’t be considered a trouble or a disturbance in one’s life rather a blessing because you have brought life into this world and what they will become because of you is your legacy.

While the others leapt and swam like penguins, Billy sat on the edge, scripted Spongebob and watched, clearly plotting the time in the near future when he would try out their tricks. The other kids grazed on fruit and biscuits, and Billy sat on the edge, jerked his arms and watched, noting which foods were eaten enthusiastically and which were the snack wallflowers. He takes these social occasions, in the same way he takes a lot of his life these days - as an active, reactive and charmingly unusual observer. You can practically hear the cogs turning, processing, sifting through the possible and the preferred, rejecting the loud, the close and the bright. He needs a ton of McDonalds fries as bribes to attend these events, but he gets a lot out of the experience (if it come in measured doses).
Otherwise BN has no value to near 40% of the population (or even more by item 2, many Malays might want to choose a different religion or have no religion at all, a 20-30% figure means BN would be wiped out by sheer neglect to affirm UNHCR Article 18 . . . ) at all. Not-so-religious or non-Muslim Malay, Orang Asli, Indians, Chinese, will vote for BN only if the above 3 items are allowed.

(One member of the audience said to me afterwards “He just radiates calm…”) Though I had to borrow an heirloom wristwatch off Gordon Murdie to let OWD keep time – I use my mobile phone for occasions like this, and Owen Dudley Edwards does not do digital technology.
Anyway, so Evil Sister learns of the accident and frames it like Park Ha interrupted Yi Gak’s meeting and created problems. Grandma calls him over and scolds him and as one would expect, he never gets the chance to explain. What happens is that Grandma no longer wants Park Ha living at his place and that Yi Gak needs to redeem himself at work after this recent blunder. Grandma tells him not to kick her out himself and that she’d be going over to do the honors herself. Oh goodie!

Our first impressions on this wine was that it “smelled grapey”, and didn’t really see any legs. However, we did noticed citrus notes and tones and agreed it was a nice easy drinking and fairly light wine. We could see this as being a fantastic buy for summer, and in wine spritzers (wine and sparkling water mix).

I had taken $20 out to spend. I understand this is a paltry amount to spend at a casino, but then again, I wasn't there to play really. And guess what?

Step 2. Ok, so your first stitch has got a small bump like thing at the bottom of it (as do all the stitches on this side). This is how you identify a purl stitch/row. The knit stitch has a "v" shaped look. Remember when you were making a knit stitch, you placed the needle from front to back, through the first (and subsequent stitches)... for a purl stitch it is the opposite. You place your needle throught the first stitch and subsequent stitches, from back to front, as shown above.

One of BAFPA’s bigger obstacles is time. It takes time to apparatus the arrangement appropriately — a lot of time, and patience, and absorption — three things abounding adults are not accommodating to accord up, it seems. I accept it’s easier to let teachers, lawyers, politicians, annual reporters, and retailers achieve the decisions of what’s adapted for your adolescent for you, or to accept your adolescent will aimlessly achieve acceptable decisions on their own, but afterwards your involvement, either anon or subconsciously, you cannot apprehend such things to consistently be what’s best.
An unthinkable danger. An unexpected choice.Annabel, once the daughter of a wealthy merchant, is trapped in indentured servitude to Lord Ranulf, a recluse who is rumored to be both terrifying and beastly. Her circumstances are made even worse by the proximity of Lord Ranulf's bailiff---a revolting man who has made unwelcome advances on Annabel in the past.Believing that life in a nunnery is the best way to escape the escalation of the bailiff's vile behavior and to preserve the faith that sustains her, Annabel is surprised to discover a sense of security and joy in her encounters with Lord Ranulf. As Annabel struggles to confront her feelings, she is involved in a situation that could place Ranulf in grave danger. Ranulf's future, and possibly his heart, may rest in her hands, and Annabel must decide whether to follow the plans she has

7. Was it worth it? I can't trace any sales back to the ads, but the ads had over half a million views over the course of the campaign, so at least it raised awareness of the book. I think they may have encouraged a few people to add the book to their shelves. I'd like to try a Goodreads giveaway when I have paper books and see if that's more effective.

I enjoyed the bright, refreshing flavor of the lemonade sugar cookies that I made recently so much, that I was kind of hankering for some more citrus. But instead of lemon again, I decided to go with lime this time. I was thinking key lime pie. But when I was looking through my Cook’s Illustrated Cookbook, I saw this recipe for key lime pie bars. The crust is unique in that it uses animal crackers instead of graham crackers because their more neutral taste allows the lime to sing. The filling is thickened with both cream cheese and an egg yolk so it is firm enough to hold together when you pick up a bar. Surprisingly, this recipe recommends using supermarket limes (Persian) over true key limes. Why? There are a few reasons. ATK says that most people can’t distinguish the flavor difference, they are easier to find and there are much fewer to juice. I think the bars are perfect as is or with a touch of sweetened whipped cream. But if you want, you can top them with sweetened, toasted coconut.

But, not now. Now, it’s babies, babies, everywhere.
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door - Only this, and nothing more." Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore - For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore - Nameless here for evermore. And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, "'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door - Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; - This it is, and nothing more." Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you"- here I opened wide the door; - Darkness there, and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" - Merely this, and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice: Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore - Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; - 'Tis the wind and nothing more." Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door - Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door - Perched, and sat, and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore. "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore - Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!" Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door - Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as "Nevermore." But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered - Till I scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown before - On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before." Then the bird said, "Nevermore." Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store, Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore - Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of 'Never - nevermore'." But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore - What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking "Nevermore." This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er, She shall press, ah, nevermore! Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor. "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he hath sent thee Respite - respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore: Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!" Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! - Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted - On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore - Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!" Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil - prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore - Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore - Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore." Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." "Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting - "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!" Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor

When the new analytics at the front end are added to the service offered to LSPs and to Relativity integration, Digital Reef seem to have an integrated business plan as well as a technology solution.

Thanks for the constant support and love.
I'm really hoping we get all the beers on tap everyday.... This "Here now" and "Gone till some unannounced time later" is highly annoying! I've gone multiple days to the same fest and never got a chance to taste some beers after 3 days of visits. There's something majorly wrong with that. I understand supply and demand, but there needs to be better communication to the public. Maybe a board that states when certain beers will be on tap.... How about using the HAF web site to have a real time list of beers with a schedule of popular beer tap openings and closings?
It is a true gift to have friendship and support from all over the world.
Why I liked it: Based on a true story, this is far different from all the middle grade novels I've read recently. The prose is deceptively spare and simple, told from Ivan's point of view. Yet it reverberates with deeper meaning, with wisdom and humor and heartache. If caged animals could talk, imagine what they would tell us. Katherine Applegate has imagined that, and done it beautifully. This is one of those books that kids will latch onto and want to read again and again.
