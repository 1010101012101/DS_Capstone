The success of Family Guy has brought him a great deal of success, going on to create American Dad! and The Cleveland Show (a Family Guy spin-off) for Fox, as well as being tapped to revamp The Flintstones, a show that has certainly inspired him, for a new set of episodes to begin airing next year.

Hudson has slept all night for the last 2 nights. He's always been a really good sleeper. I think it also helps that he's snuggled into me all night every night. I love co-sleeping, wouldn't ever change it! He eats like a champ, nursing is amazing as always. He started smiling a few weeks ago but only for me, Justin has yet to see his big gummy grin.

Some individuals respond by concluding that Christianity is not true. Some go so far as to conclude that God does not even exist! I submit to you that these responses are ill-founded; the result of elevating the doctrine of inerrancy to a status it should not be accorded in one’s theological taxonomy. While the Bible is an indispensable aid to our faith and Christian growth, an inerrant Bible is not necessary for the truth of Christianity, and thus the doctrine of inerrancy—and Bibliology in general—should be subservient to more central doctrines such as the resurrection of Jesus in our theological taxonomy. Let me explain.

For 31 years I taught young people from fifth grade through high school, knowing I was influencing lives in a positive way. But I was half-way through my career before I realized that I could function in a spiritual way while teaching secular material. Because of specific prayers I saw two hostile students become buddies, came up with simple but impactful lessons, and saw a usually non-confrontational staff member take leadership in a messy situation.

Saucony have different types of running shoes for different kinds of feet because each person has different shape of feet. This is very important when you are buying a pair of shoes. You have to consider the pronation of your feet. Basically, there are three types of pronation; overpronation means flat feet, underpronation means high arch and neutral pronation means average arch. This pronation factor is very important in running because the arching in your foot creates the motion control. And the right shoe pronation will most likely protect you from getting foot injury. You have to remember that when it comes to buying a pair of shoes, you have to make sure that you are comfortable with the right kind of shoes for right type of activity.

Font size, I don't think I can do too much about. It depends on which device you use. I've already had comments that the font is too small and too big. If you use Windows, hold 'ctrl' and wiggle the wheel on the mouse to make the font bigger or smaller. If you use something else, there's probably a way to adjust font size but I don't know what it is.

Through the work of a poet called Clemens Brentano, many of these fascinating insights were published during the middle of the nineteenth century. Several books of visions were published, though two were particularly popular: The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to the Meditations of Anne Catherine Emmerich and The Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary From the Visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich.
Lucien's school had a multicultural night last week. Each class did a song or dance from a fancy exotic culture somewhere in the world. Lucien's class did a Japanese dance with fans, which we all agreed was culturally enlightening. The audience was perplexed, however, when the next class did a Hank Williams song. Ahh, yes... the mysterious, exotic culture of Hank.
As they started to gather up their stuff that was ready to go home, we started talking about plans for Christmas - Part 2. We realized that the next day was Christmas Day and we were committed to dinner and such at TA's mom's house. We knew we wouldn't be home early enough to have our Christmas that evening. Sooooo, we agreed to put off Christmas - Part 3 to Sunday evening. Ratchlet had a work commitment earlier in the day, so she asked if we would be willing to pack up the rest of the presents plus whatever Santa brought and bring it all down to their house just to simplify their schedules. The Big Guy readily agreed on our behalf. I wasn't thrilled with that idea, but these were turning into extraordinary circumstances.

After discussing the likely permanence of the Mark of the Beast on a person’s body, it is important to note that the electronic skin technology that researchers have developed is not permanent. The video above suggests that the electronic skin can be easily removed. In addition, a Nature.com article notes that electronic skin has a lifespan of only a few days because human skin sheds frequently.

I know that I’m not doing everything I could be to meet my goals, and since I have the food portion down (for the most part), I really need to step up my game with the workouts. Because not only will they help me lose inches (smaller sizes!) and feel better (endorphins!), but consistent workouts will allow me a bit of leeway if I do end up overindulging. And since I’m really working on having balance in my life and my healthy lifestyle, I need to be able to indulge now and then.

Certainly the word evangelical itself, taken to its roots, has a pretty basic meaning. It originates from the Greek εὐαγγέλιον (evangelion), which stems from ευ (“good”) + ἀγγέλλω (“bear news”). The εὐαγγέλιον is the message being borne, the “good news” — in Christian usage, the gospel of Christ. An evangelist is someone who bears the gospel, and in Catholic circles usually refers to the four authors of the biblical Gospels, Ss. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. So evangelical literally means “of, pertaining to, or conveying good news (the gospel).”

There have been some foolish demolitions in Stratford upon Avon and amongst he historic gems are some repulsive concrete blocks, although it is not quite as bad as Gloucester. Stratford is world-famous as the birthplace of William Shakespeare there is a need for the town to look like it did when he was alive but often the wrong values obtrude and like Liverpool they start spoiling what they should conserve.
All our lives we're bombarded with certain images, certain ideas, certain characters and certain situations. TV programmes, adverts, books, the stories in magazines, films, music videos...you just can't escape The One True Vision of the world that mainstream media is flooding your brain with 27-7 (this links into various other posts I've made BTW - extra points if you can tell me which ones!). If you don't clear a little space in your head where your story can breathe and find its own One True Vision, you'll just end up recycling those again and again too.

This however has no such excitement, for all cooking lager tastes more or less the same. It is not drunk for flavour as it has very little. It is drunk because we Brits like to get pissed but are unable to cope with proper lager. We therefore neck cooking lager in vast quantities and piss it all up the wall. Its what makes us better than other countries.

Its was a truly special beer, a brilliant evening and definitely worth the money I paid for it.

While there is a serious language barrier, and it can be frustrating at times, I'm always able to work things out. And while I'd like to hang out more with people around here, I've always been a fairly independent person. On the other hand, I have been able to spend some time with friends. It's great to see Ellie, Eiji, and Tora about once a month, and I've hung out with my training mates too. One of them is in a band and I saw her perform last weekend. I met a bunch of expats there, and one Japanese woman who lives near me (one train station away, actually)!
As SwingBot recuperated, BG changed condoms and continued fucking, now in my cunt. We all collapsed on the bed after that. After a brief rest, BG started me going again with oral attention to my nether regions. He fucked me, finished, and then SwingBot surprised me by telling BG to get out of the way so that SwingBot could take his turn with me, which he did. I could really get used to this serial sex partner trend.
While I have always been a coupon clipper, I didn't realize the true value or power of couponing until I had to. I have now been a "serious" couponer for about 4 years now. Today, I wanted to share with you some lessons that I have learned along the way from my perspective.

As they walk back to you, you contemplate telling them what just occurred in your mind, but instead throw them a smirk and kiss them as they grab your hand. It is moments like that that make love all worthwhile. You could be anywhere, doing anything and that one person will always be yours. Whether they are on the other side of the room, or right by your side always remember you are the luckiest person in that room because that one amazing person loves you and calls you theirs.
I feel a bit like Harry. I am surrounded by distorted yet familiar faces that smile and live with little regard of what is to happen in a few short hours. I have come in anticipation that this will change everything. This will mark me as Muggle Mandy, forever expelled from the world of magic, the promise of an envelope delivered by a hooting carrier. Usually my best friend would be sitting beside me, making fun of the sappy parts. Then a boyfriend or two had taken me over the years… None of them were to be bothered or found that night. I did get a few archaic text messages on my Tracfone when I checked the time. The battery was dying and I placed it in my bag. I didn’t want to talk to anyone. I just wanted to face the end alone. Alone with all the characters I came to consider friends long ago…

I'd done a tiny, tiny amount of web work at the DM shop, but I found that this didn't stop headhunters pimping me out as Mr. Web 2.0. I did site builds, I did virals, I did banners galore. Although I got work at pure web agencies I also worked at DM agencies that had sprouted web agencies. These have to be the only kind of agency where the general level of morale is lower than in DM, with people openly self-harming at their desks, the corridors littered with derelict monitors and shattered dreams. Ok, if you work at a DM place quite often you're adapting the above-the-line concept into roll-fold or whatever, but at the DM/web shop you're adapting the roll-fold into a banner ad. The best argument I ever heard for working in ATL is that you want to be near where The Idea starts - these places are where The Idea comes to die. If I ever start taking drugs again, and need money for scag, this is where I will work, because I'm quite certain you could be spazzed off your baps and no-one one would be any the wiser. The process at these places tended to be hopelessly convolved and Kafkaesqe, so that, even if your creative director liked your scamps, they'd still get shot down because the DM Creative Director had no idea what was going on, or the ATL Creative Director above her was still having to have the concept of a web banner explained to him every two days.

Looking back on the trail, it’s always good to see how far we’ve come (or not, but it always feels like far as we’re huffing for breath). There was a powerful wind blowing though we couldn’t actually feel it, it was making the trees creek and whine and sway above us. That is one of my favorite sounds. It makes me ponder the many things in life that we can’t visualize or even feel sometimes, but we still know they are there.

Even though he threatened me with violence to get me to do what he wanted, he is very nice. He asked me several times if I was ok, if I needed a break.

With the homosexual who claims to be a Christian, they should be shown that, from a biblical standpoint, from God’s point of view, homosexuality is a sin. Homosexuality is a sin that destroys their relationship with God, and it is a sin that will destroy their lives. If a Christian who claims to be a homosexual will not respond to our pleas, and to the Bible’s admonitions, then church discipline should be enacted, as with any major sin. How do we do this?

Vge Cafe is a vegetarian restaurant, with an environmentally-conscious message. All the food is fresh trash (never frozen or canned) and the trash is compostable.

The salad greens at Vge Cafe were definitely fresh.

("He's batting .600 & leading the majors in hitting, but do we really know what he's got?") Outside of something that ridiculous, both of these statements cannot be true.

The pay is fantastic, I get benefits and the customers are so awesome. Anyways, Halloween is our busiest season so we get all that stuff in pretty early.

The Thunder came to OKC in 2008 and I say that city got a great gift. I honestly cannot imagine growing up, or living, in a city that did not have a professional sports team. (Side note-OKC did get a bit of a showing of what having a professional team would be like in 2005 when the New Orleans Hornets would relocate to play their games at the (formally named) Ford Center after Hurricane Katrina. The Hornets were the first NBA team to play games in Oklahoma City.)

The CD? Good tunes, if a bit heavy on reggae for my tastes (do small labels get reggae artists for the same reason small breweries do ales: it's easier and cheaper?). The Smoked Porter, on the other hand, was very much to my tastes. Porter, no matter what else it is, should be drinkable, downright quaffable. If it isn't, I think it misses the whole point of being porter. Gorges doesn't let the smoke get in your eyes and overwhelm the porter, it's not gaggingly bitter, and it's not woozily strong. Mostly it tasted "moreish," as the sainted MJ used to say.

Kugel himself is a very likeable character, the classically ‘nebbish’ Jewish character who is riven with paranoia and anxiety, and who is too self-aware for his own good. Constantly second-guessing himself, his heart is in the right place - who wouldn’t, if offered the opportunity, give Anne Frank a place to live? - but this clashes with his more immediate responsibilities, to his wife and young son. He is, naturally, in therapy, although Kugel’s therapist, Dr Jove, is a rather bracing man who preaches against hope and optimism. ‘Give Up,’ says the sign in Dr Jove’s office, ‘You’ll Live Longer’.

As with all things in God’s Kingdom, there are keys He gives us that unlock the treasures He has for us. The keys to engaging God’s provision and protection are plainly stated in Psalm 91. “He who dwells in the shadow of the Most High, the shelter of the Almighty…Because you have made the Lord your refuge, the Most High your habitation…Because he cleaves to Me in Love…Because he knows My Name.” These are the keys to abundant life in Christ (John 10:10).
Years later I developed a strong interest in genealogy. I found out there was a tradition in my family of being descended from an Indian. Doing more research over the past thirty years, I have actually found about three documented lines that descend from native American ancestors. Knowing nothing about them, I’ve tried to learn about their lives, their tribal customs, and so forth. And I’ve tried to consider what in my life now is influenced by their blood being in my veins. My conclusion is inconclusive.
I think that Evans-Pritchard may have a point. While the U.S. has certainly seen better days, in comparison to much of the rest of the world, things don't seem all that bad, so relatively speaking, we could remain on top. And I am in agreement with him that the energy situation in this country is looking better all the time: we appear to have up to 100 years worth of natural gas in the ground, if only the environmentalists will let us get it.

Anyway, yes, the rest of the crew weren't much better. One particular man, Gentleman George Dandry, (or "Gentle George" as he was sometimes referred to) attempted to stab me in the ear with a wooden spoon on no less than 15 different occasions. I've no idea why he took such a dislike to me, Rich, I can only surmise that he was NOT a fan of the game I-Spy. A game which had become very dear to me on the long dark sleepless nights in our quarters.

The United States Court of Federal Claims (“Claims Court”) held that a drunk driver who killed two Sioux men on a Sioux reservation was not a “bad man” within the meaning of the 1868 Laramie Treaty, and that in any event, the relevant provisions of the Treaty are no longer enforceable by its beneficiaries. Considering our textual analysis, and because we held in Tsosie v. United States, 825 F.2d 393, 395 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the “bad men” provisions (“‘bad men’ provisions”) of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 (“the Laramie Treaty”) are not limited to persons acting for or on behalf of the United States, and because the Claims Court’s textual analysis and its historical recitations are erroneous or incomplete, the Claims Court improperly dismissed Appellants’ Complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.

From the documents my uncle received, it looks like we have a little bit more to the story. Up until now, we didn't even know where he was born or where he lived in New York. But now in an instant, a life becomes real, one long since gone. Now we know that he was born in Russia (Lisanka, which could also be spelled Lysyanska, and is in the Ukraine) on December 15, 1884 and he emigrated to America from Hamburg, Germany about February 5, 1904 and lived for 16 years in Hartford, Connecticut. He was naturalized as an American citizen on August 9, 1910 and had never returned to Europe after he arrived in America.

This was the first year I've watched the Oscars in as long as I can remember. I don't usually watch many movies during the year, but I was pretty happy to drink some tea on the couch and watch the biggest fashion parade of the year. While I loved many of the dresses, I couldn't really picture myself in any of them. Thankfully, there's lots of lingerie out there that can make you look just as glamorous and lovely. In fact, there are even lots of direct translations of these looks out there by lingerie designers. If you're like me and are more inclined to invest in glamorous underwear than outerwear, this guide is definitely for you.

So when we consider social capital, I want them to have a basic understanding of what it is, to recognise that social capital is important to our wellbeing and to realise that how they work can help build social capital (or undermine it). Hopefully they will also understand there is debate about the term. that it is difficult to measure and that it isn’t a panacea to all society’s problems. They don’t need to be able to write a sociological analysis of social capital or to create a statistically reliable measure of it.
Not of much appeal for middle-schoolers, to be sure, but I’ve always been struck by how his writing prowess was recognized around the world before it came to the attention of his employer and my alma mater, Oregon State. As I recall, he was offered a prestigious fellowship but his boss in the English Department wouldn’t let him out of his teaching obligation … a decision that shortly led to Malamud’s departure from the university.

I've had many "break out and spread your wings moments" in my life ... they sometimes come in curious forms, but are always life changing. What propels us on to bigger and better things is the stretching ... beyond what we had known and done. Stick your neck out and see what's just beyond your reach and then - REACH for it! That's scary sometimes. But if we just hang out in that cozy cocoon and "work on it" - sometimes half heartedly ... then when do we get to test out our wings?

While people’s movements are taking on the mining giants, Maoist guerrillas are also active in this region. Though some villagers have been drawn to them, many are alienated by their acts of indiscriminate violence – attacking and derailing trains carrying ordinary, not particularly well-off, citizens, for example, or sporadically killing not only police and paramilitary officers but also Adivasi villagers and taking hostages to try to negotiate freedom for Maoist prisoners. Their approach to the multinational companies is contradictory, while they have attacked an Essar pipeline, for example, they have also been exposed (by WikiLeaks) for taking protection money from the same company. While both Essar and Maoists spokespersons have denied this, some local people say the news is merely a confirmation of what they had long suspected.

Dear TigerTime Supporter,
That, and Spring.
I love your enthusiasm for my books, I appreciate your support, and I’m especially thankful you took the time out of your busy day to review the books and post the reviews, but . . . must you give away so much of the plot? A review is not a synopsis and readers do not need you to reveal every major plot point of the book. And they especially do not need (or want) you to tell them how it ends. What people want is a reason to read the book, and if you tell them too much, you have taken away any reason for them to read it, in which case you have done us all a disservice. And I am sure that was never your intention.
I also put a turtle and rabbit on my teaching clock and the kids watch how the rabbit is always running fast around the clock while the turtle is trying it's hardest to catch it.

Regular readers will note that every now and then I do an "In Memoriam", honoring a public figure that has recently passed away. I give the name, the years of birth and death, occupation, a list of notable works (books, movies, TV shows, etc.) and a quote of some sort. I try to find a suitable quote that comes directly from the deceased themselves, but if that proves impossible, I'll use a quote by a third party about the deceased instead. Sometimes, if one quote just doesn't sum up that person's essence, I'll use two or more. On rare occasions, I'll explain just what it was about the deceased that interested me. If the public figure's not quite public enough, I'll provide a link.
For some time now, I have wanted to look at who the best scorers in ASC play were this past season. Now, I am going to do it. I am going to base the notion of “best scorer” on three factors: workload, shooting skill, and ball protection. For workload, I am using a player’s shot percentage (Shot%), or how many of his team’s shots he took while on the floor. Most high workloads will be upwards of 25% of a team’s shots while he is on the floor. For shooting skill, I am using true shooting percentage (TS%), which translates a player’s shooting percentages on twos, threes, and free throws into an equivalent two-point shooting percentage. For ball protection, I am using a player’s turnover percentage (TO%), or the percentage of the time a player commits a turnover relative to the number of times he tries to score.

Lossless codecs are typically used for archiving data in a compressed form while retaining all of the information present in the original stream. If preserving the original quality of the stream is more important than eliminating the correspondingly larger data sizes, lossless codecs are preferred. This is especially true if the data is to undergo further processing (for example editing) in which case the repeated application of processing (encoding and decoding) on lossy codecs will degrade the quality of the resulting data such that it is no longer identifiable (visually, audibly or both).
It could have been way worse.
What’s troubling is that Chairman McKeon’s post gives you the impression that it defends sec. 1021—the discretionary detention provision—when, in fact, his post is all about sec. 1022, the mandatory provision. The post conspicuously defends “the provision,” without referencing a specific section number. And, at the end, it includes a chart titled “Section 1021 of the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act,” even though one of the two quotes in the chart is from sec. 1022, not 1021.
According to the gift of faith I am able to do a thing, or believe that a thing will come to pass, the not doing of which, or the not believing of which, would not be sin; according to the grace of faith I am able to do a thing, or believe that a thing will come to pass, respecting which I have the word of God as the ground to rest upon, and, therefore, the not doing it, or the not believing it, would be sin.

As a finale, Percy Faith presents The Loveliest Night Of The Year from "The Great Caruso", an especially interesting example of the use made of classic themes. The basic material here is an old waltz called Over The Waves, by Waldteufel, adapted by Irving Aaronson with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster, and the resulting re-creation enjoyed a spectacular success not only as a theme melody, but as an independent popular song. The music presented here by Percy Faith not only gives a cross-section of Hollywood's striking use of music, but provides rewarding listening for anyone interested in lovely themes in brilliant orchestrations. This is music from Hollywood, arranged and played for your pleasure by Percy Faith and his Orchestra in a stimulating and provocative collection.
It is clear to see, after reading the information above that removing adipose tissue from around the abdominal region is something of the utmost importance. With an increase of weight issues for many and an increase in both childhood and adulthood obesity, the lethal nature of visceral fat is a worry. Two things which can, and must be done are control of fat in our diet and an exercise routine which helps burn the fatty tissue and develop strong abdominal muscles, with higher calorie demand. If muscles grow in size then they have a higher resting calorie demand than muscle with a smaller overall mass, which means you will burn more calories at rest and therefore burn more fatty tissue.

The rain was pretty persistent throughout the course, and I was getting cold – though very thankful for my gloves. I was started to drag a bit at about 18 miles and my head started to drop a little. From about 20 onwards there were a few periods of walking dropped in as my chest/diagphram started to cramp and I was a little despondent that I was falling away from my 4:10(ish) target. As the 4:30 pacers came past I tried my best to stick with them for the rest of the race, but by the of another mile I had lost them too – this confused me though as I thought I was still on for about 4:20 if I really tried, so god only knows what time the 4:30 lot ended up with.

It's called burikaw when it's quite that big, and buntiek when it's small.

You may have heard that DB2 10 will use 1 MB page frames (if available) for page-fixed buffer pools. That's true, and this feature of DB2 10 further boosts the CPU savings effect of fixing buffers in memory by improving the efficiency of virtual-to-real storage address translation (versus a 4 KB page frame usage scenario). Keep this in mind, though: DB2 9 can't use 1 MB page frames for buffer pools, whether page-fixed or not. What this means is that you don't want to configure an overly large portion of your z/OS system's real storage resource to be managed using 1 MB page frames (that's done via the LFAREA parameter of the IEASYSxx member of PARMLIB) until you've migrated to DB2 10 and are likely past the point of needing to fall back to DB2 9. If you want to be conservative, migrate to DB2 10 and THEN configure your z/OS system for 1 MB page frames.

The first beer brands I became aware of were due no doubt to product placement in American movies put on UK TV. Coors for me is the beer Burt Reynolds transported across America with Smokey on his tale. Budweiser is the beer he drank when he was a drunk at the start of the sequel where they transported an Elephant. These brands looked exotic, exciting and representative of an American culture I much admired as a teenager. Maybe putting Hydes Bitter on in the Rovers Return wouldn’t have had the same effect but arguably neither option is an encouragement to drink. Drinking is a normal adult activity I was always going to have a go at regardless of what Curly Watts drank alongside having sex, driving and getting a credit card, and none of it so far has done me any harm and my intention is to keep going because I quite enjoy it. Especially the drinking and having sex bit.

Stylistically, in my own work there are things stolen from him, reactions against him—but in describing him this way, it’s only to place him on a shelf with other writers, and in the end…in the end it doesn’t matter how you rank writers. The rankings of writers for their own contemporaries, once they get beyond the most obvious crude distinctions, it becomes almost meaningless. There’s this distortion of the present. Talking about influences at all is complicated, and has more to do with those one encounters than those one’d put on a favorite list.

And if you’re about to say some shit like “aww, you just haven’t met Mr. Right yet/he’ll come along/just be patient” bullshit – shut up. Please. I’m over it. I’m not a pessimist, just a realist. I’m honest with myself unlike most people. I can still walk through life with an upbeat attitude while holding onto reality – accepting the harsh reality that is the world doesn’t mean walking around with a dark cloud over your head and frowning all the time lol So I’ll just walk around cheesing real hard like I already do 24/7, but with a heavy heart.

The event involved a fantastic group of up-and-coming Toronto based indie designers, who were each given a $50 gift certificate to Double Take with which to purchase items that they were then to repurpose into new and trendy designs. It was a really interesting premise that encourages us to do a number of good things - purchase and repurpose second hand items in order to support those in need and decrease our carbon footprint, support local businesses and independent designers, and donate items from our wardrobe that we are no longer using. It was a fabulous event that supported a very worthwhile cause, and I was so pleased to have been invited and in attendance. Those of you who are budding Toronto designers should consider entering next year... =D
Enclosed is a sample chapter.
9. Volunteers have full T-shirt rights and all privileges pertaining thereto. So there. Remember, you can always volunteer for a race and get a shirt. I encourage this as your civil duty to be a member of the running community. Races don't happen without volunteers, folks.

But the hospital rang in the middle of lunch to update us on Mum's planned treatment. It was a reminder that no matter how nice and peaceful my birthday lunch was, that the stresses of these past few months are still there and there are still big hurdles to climb for everyone. I wish it were otherwise - but we don't have that option. It doesn't work like that.
But I’m going to focus on the magic. Broadway became the Great White Way (even after the snow ploughs got stuck in). Literally as well as figuratively. Cars were indistinguishable, buried under their powdery shrouds. Central Park was a mass of wondrous white landscapes, decorated with peaks of snow like fluffy meringues. Picture those snowy Christmas cards where everything is draped in white. Rocks were pinned down by a thick snow mantle and slender bushes looked like they were covered in burst cotton pods. Harlem Meer (such a thoroughly Dutch name) was a dense milky sheet and much of the Central Park boat lake was frozen, the edges carrying mounds of splattered snow where people had hurled snowballs to test the resilience of the ice.
I often stop by a place called Colassessano’s Pizza to pick up a pepperoni roll with sauce and cheese. Many of you are probably wondering, “What in the world is a pepperoni roll?” Well, let me tell you. I know them quite well. I have been eating them since 1974.
The second thing I hate about them is the scar. And not even the scar so much, but the flap of skin that develops over the scar. I've had three c-sections now, so I am blessed with what I lovingly call my "front butt". It looks for all the world like a flabby ass perched just over my girly parts. No amount of exercise or dieting can get rid of it. Shortly before Big Daddy left, I had talked my OB into recommending a therapeutic tummy tuck (for reals. They exist.). I met with the plastic surgeon, and was just about to schedule the surgery when Big Daddy pulled the insurance out from under me. Fucker. But now, having lived the life I've lived, I realize that having a front butt isn't the worst that can happen to a girl. I have learned to co-exist with it.
Roll the dough into a rectangle shape about 30 cm wide and 3cm thick. Length doesn’t matter, it only determines how many buns you’ll be able to cut once it is rolled up. (You can divide the dough into two equal sizes before rolling it, to make it easier to manage) Spread your extra soft butter/oil on the rolled out dough, sprinkle evenly the extra sugar and ground cinnamon. Start rolling up the dough width ways, making it nice and tight/compact. Cut into about 5cm long pieces. Turn them on their side and press down gently.
sprinkles optional

We've also hit up a few family parties/dinners in the past few weeks. I love a good old fashioned get together and hanging out with people. I think our friends/family thing we are odd, only because we are younger, but we really enjoy hanging out with everyone. I made a 7layer Mexican dip that got rave reviews and also got a FAB/YUM recipe for a Greek-style layer dip. Only social etiquette held hubby and myself from just eating the entire thing. So good!
Will they realize the error of their ways in 4 yeras? (I’m hoping *I’m* the one who’s wrong, but I really doubt it.)
Some legislators want to address “salary spiking,” a term that refers to what an employee can do to improve his or her PERA benefit by getting a big salary hike in the last few years before retiring. SB 10-001 addressed salary spiking by limiting year-to-year salary increases to eight percent under HAS. PERA’s salary spiking provisions are already among the most restrictive in the nation. Plus, the opportunity to “spike” one’s salary is just not possible for the typical PERA member.

Although he claims to be sad at the demise of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, he showed that Gaddafi was not the leader he purported to be.
This line of attack strikes me as weak--State Bar organizations in all 50 states have restrictions of various types on what can and cannot be said about judges, criminal cases, etc. Upholding the Cline argument would essentially require Judge Hobgood holding that the State Bar codes in all 50 states are unconstitutional.

Having eaten all the peanut butter, the bear left the bird feeder in favor of ransacking his garage. When the bear finally had enough to keep him going for the rest of the winter, he left without incident. When Bernie investigated the damage, he found bird feed everywhere from the countless bags Bernie stored there for the local bird population to rely on for winter. Fortunately, for all of us, this winter was not bad at all. As part of the damage, Bernie found an iron rod that the bear had bent in his crazed attack on the bird feed storage cage. To this day, Bernie has yet to find anyone who can bend that bar back to its original position. He even tried having the bar torched to melt it back to shape and even that didnʼt work. Maybe Bernie should leave the bar in the garage and hope that super bear returns and bend the bar back for him.

To begin with, there’s the question of whether there’s labor demand for the college-educated sufficient to cover large numbers of additional graduates. The evidence doesn’t look that good. While those with PhDs, professional degrees, and master’s degrees are genuinely doing well, those with bachelor’s have an unemployment rate 50% higher, and the 25% of graduates with associate degrees have a 7% unemployment rate and below-average wages (college dropouts have even higher unemployment rates and lower wages). These stats are rosy by comparison to the situation facing recent college graduates, who have less work experience to bolster their resumes: 22.4% of them are unemployed.
That’s it for now, hopefully you are inspired to get out and plant something, there are few more rewarding experiences.

Its origins date back to George Washington who referred to God repeatedly throughout his public and private life. Just before the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776, he told his assembled forces, “The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army.”
I know, it might feel a bit out of place to post about ice cream in November when it's getting cold outside but then you can make your ice cream winter proof by adding a warm sauce or fruit compote. In this case it's a toffee sauce that goes well with the popcorn flavour and adds some extra texture to it. And as I love salted caramel I figured I might as well do a salted popcorn flavour.

Because I put my foot down in 1990 when she stole money from me. She dipped into a joint checking account we had together for THE PURPOSE OF BUYING REAL ESTATE. The money was to be used for lawyer fees, closing costs, etc. I borrowed over $4000.00 from a bank and put it in the account – Joan and her husband didn’t contribute a penny. And when the brakes in Joan’s car needed work – guess what she did? SHE TOOK MY F’ING MONEY! Then we were to get a refund from the lawyer – the lawyer sent us a letter saying it would be split between the two of us. I was pissed, because it had been ALL my money in the first place. And Joan agreed to cash the check and give me the cash. THEN she calls me up and says she was keeping it to buy christmas presents for HER kids. I blew up – and said “You PROMISED me that money. YOU gave birth to those kids, they are YOUR responsibilty to provide holidays for them. I WANT MY MONEY TO FIX MY CAR.” – see, when we dissolved the partnership, and I got back the remainder of my money after Joan and her bum husband stole from it, I returned that money to the bank. Then MY car broke down – and I had no money to fix it. The interest I was paying on the loan and the shortage caused by THIEVES Joan and Colby left me nothing to fix my car. So yeah, I bitched her out on the phone and told her to keep the f’ing money and I never wanted to see her again. This is why she thinks I hate her kids – because I told her that I didn’t give birth to them and it WAS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE CHRISTMAS FOR THEM.
One day, sometime around my freshman year in high school, while digging around through a box of books that my dad had stored in what we called the "back room", I found this non-descript story about baseball. I thumbed through it, and, not having anything better to read, I decided to read it. The story itself wasn't terribly intriguing; the book was not very well-written. It had a definite Bad News Bears vibe to it: some middle-aged guy, going through a mid-life crisis, decides to coach his son's baseball team or some bullshit like that. The guy who sponsors the team doesn't come through with the money, mostly because he's an old cocksucker, until they reach the (insert shocked face gasp here) championship game, which they, predictably, win.

A week ago we mentioned the Kickstarter campaign that Glasgow's Team Girl Comic collective were running to finance the publication of TGC issue 5 and possibly reprint some of their sold-out back issues. It has been the most viewed blog piece on downthetubes over the last week even if the Kickstarter video, featuring TGC editor Gillian Hatcher and issue 5 cover artist Coleen Campbell, was incompatible with our Blogspot format. Our thanks to Gillian for pointing us towards the YouTube version.
When Catherine died in 1796, her son Paul succeeded her — but their relationship had always been a difficult one, starting from his birth when the Empress Elizabeth took him away and severely limited Catherine’s access to her own son. Peter the Great had changed the law so that a Russian ruler could name his or own successor — meaning Catherine had tactical power to keep her son under her control. When Paul finally reached the throne he changed it back to primogeniture, or the nearest male heir. “Never again would an heir have to go through what Paul had been through,” Massie writes. “And never again would Russia be ruled by a woman.”

Patick was devastated he was even considering killing this man, he owned seral firearms and he considered to one of them (BUT GOD). Long story short, my friend played a dirty act she should have left him if she could not forgive him.
I recently had a dream of death. A nameless malady was afoot: it caused people to become drowsy; if they fell asleep, they died. I contracted the malady. I felt myself getting sleepy. I knew what would happen if I gave in to sleep. I was frightened. Yet, there was part of me that thought that giving in might not be such a bad thing: after all, it was only endless sleep that awaited me. The most vivid feature of the dream was the choice that I faced: to wit, the emotion involved in the pull between the fear of extinction and the release of just letting go.

My very brief hesitation at studying my options so irritated a woman I knew to be a high-powered floor nurse with aspirations to becoming a war criminal she rolled down her window and screamed at me to move. Not wanting to draw anymore of her attention and possible ire, I decided discretion was the better part of valor and got the hell out of the way while saying a prayer she did not remember my name or ever came to night shift to work. The one piece of good news about the low tire pressure warning light was that it was glowing yellow, instead of red, which meant that I had a little time before the problem tire went completely flat.
This just popped up in my Facebook feed via an acquaintance I know through my support of Jack Marshall, a 6-year-old boy from Scunthorpe, England, who battled a brain tumour and sadly passed away in October last year. I debated blogging about it, but I’ve come to the conclusion that it meets the remit of cyberloss because of the content.
I think my brain needs cleaning. It should be taken out gently and a toothbrush run over that knobbly grey stuff. Like polishing heavily chased silver, getting into all the grooves.

Maybe you are tormented by the cruel and hurtful actions of someone close to you. Maybe it is peer pressure, trouble at work, damaged relationships, or mistakes you have made.

For each chapter I have a bank of between two and six different reassessments (in addition to two versions for in-class assessment), but I hope to increase that number each term. With so few reassessments, you might ask if I’m worried students might study someone else’s reassessment and hope to get the same version? My view is that if they want to study that many different versions, they’ll master the material soon enough. To keep track who has taken which version, I write down the version number in the Google spreadsheet that records their reassessment requests and then I can just sort the spreadsheet by student name and quickly see which version of a reassessment a student has taken before. I do keep copies of reassessment for each chapter in file folders, but I can quickly glance at the Google spreadsheet each morning to see if I need to make new versions of reassessments. I’ve been recycling questions from old exams or homework sets to help me quickly throw together a reassessment. One useful trick is to simply change the context of the problems. I don’t know how many times my students complain about how different the assessment problems are from the ones we do in class. Um…. it’s the SAME problems, just different window dressing.

Other definitions. As a licence is negotiated and drafted, additional terms requiring definition will become apparent. It is best they be added to the definitions section if they are key and apply broadly to the agreement. Otherwise, they should be defined in the first paragraph or clause in which they are mentioned.
Despite the spectacular scenes of mass destruction, this superbly sustained disaster movie is more subdued than usual for the genre and contains a positive, thought-provoking message. Remarkably, there are no melodramatically emotional death scenes (no "Stay with me" rubbish) and nobody descends into reckless hysteria. That’s not to say the story isn’t a bit of stretch but, critically, disbelief is entirely suspended for the running time and that is probably co-writer / director / producer Roland Emmerich’s true skill. His movie’s are good-looking, well-acted and truly spectacular, for sure, but it’s his ability to consistently suspend disbelief and keep it there that makes these movies work, and work well.
Later on in the evening our 14 year old, M, came to us to talk about being a foreign exchange student somewhere. We have talked about this pretty much every night for a month. We told her she could enroll in the program her sophomore year. She wants to go this year. She also wants to go to England. We said no to England. If we are paying that kind of money she is going to have to learn a different language and experience something far more unique than England. She is determined to go to England so she brings it up daily, each time with a new perspective for us to think about. We listen and then say Not. Gonna. Happen. But, last night she says, "What if I work for the money and pay for it myself?" Now, she has our attention.

I would like to underscore the history of NPR and when it started. President Lyndon Baines Johnson working with congress started the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, November 7, 1967.

It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost 10 years since the True Color collaboration began! I remember when I first got the email from Lynne in 2001 about doing a collaborative project involving Color and Books, I was so excited I couldn’t type “Count me in” quickly enough!! What else could be better than that, right? Not only was I looking forward to the project, but also to working with the group of assembled artists: some of them I already knew from various teaching events and conventions, and some I had not met yet, so I was eager to share inspirations, art, and friendship.
Pralang said he did the study because there was a lack of empirical research on the subject. Many of the ideas were based on consultant recommendations marketing their services to marketing.

If you’ve ever felt like you go a little cross-eyed after taking a peek at an optical illusion, then you know they can be a pretty intense phenomenon. What your eyes perceive when looking at one of these images is actually a visual illusion; you see the image as something different than what it is because the different cells and receptors in your eyes distinguish images and colors at dissimilar speeds. The eye can only receive a limited amount of visual stimuli, but as your brain constantly processes the visual information, it gives you the illusion of continuous sight. Whether it’s an optical, physiological or cognitive illusion, the design plays a trick on your eyes (and mind). Check out some of the interesting illusions below—but beware, you may not be able to absorb them all in one sitting.

And while we’re on the topic of what now constitutes “rational” precaution, another product on the horizon is a kiddie watch or backpack tag or some-such small device that not only tracks the child via GPS (how 2009!), it will also text the parent every time the child enters or leaves a designated area. A park, say. Or the front yard. The assumption being that not only are all strangers dangerous but so is the world beyond the fence — a world no child should explore.
I accept it takes all sorts to make a world. I also realise that for the most part, I’m one of those irritatingly glass half-full people. This is the result of life experiences, parents who insisted I look for the positive, my spiritual beliefs and goodness knows what else. I fully accept that life does not always appear to be fair, but I firmly believe that life is what you make of it. You can be a victim or a victor. It’s entirely up to you. No one else, just you.

The summary of the judgment begins by reviewing various atrocities perpetrated in Sierra Leone during 1998 and 1999 associated with the civil war. As a general rule, it concludes that they were indeed committed. This is hardly surprising. It is consistent with the earlier decisions of the Court as well as the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The issue was not of course whether the atrocities were committed

When I graduated high school, and quickly came to understand that I was not smart enough to become an accountant, I managed to somehow connect with the sports editors of the local paper -- and they would send me to high school games all over North and South Carolina. And I would write about them. And this became my identity.
Lately there’s been a lot of back-and-forth on the issue of bikinis in the Cathsorority – a great example is Elizabeth’s Bikini or Biki-No. Personally, I think one bathing suit leaves you as bare as another, so unless we’re going to swim in t-shirts and basketball shorts à la middle school (tell me I’m not the only one who felt so awkward?) . . .
Some will even say that they don’t drink coffee, tea, alcohol or smoke or chew tobacco because the leaders of the church have asked them not to.
Mom: Absolutely!
Another fuzzy area: Printables. Generally, Internet coupons have a print limit of two per computer. That does not mean that you may only use two coupons. It is acceptable for you two print two coupons from each of multiple computers. As long as each of your printables has a unique barcode printed clearly on the front (and you abide by their fine print), you’re okay. Again, this means absolutely no photocopying!!
I’m of two minds on this. On one hand, it’s pretty cool that a game company is trying to be proactive about how their community will be perceived by outsiders. If women were to learn that this game is something of a ‘safe space’, and that “tits or GTFO” would be less of an issue then it’s possible they will feel much more comfortable starting, and paying for, the game. League of Legends has something of a reputation for having one of the most unnecessarily aggressive communities towards ALL gamers, but this lemur cannot verify that with facts or anecdotes (mostly because I’m not looking). By adding extra value to female players, it may indeed provide a buffer from the usual “make me a sammich” comments rife within the community. If you harass your XX players too much, they could leave and you’d be without the added bonuses but doesn’t make the game impossible to play if you have no female friends.

I love giving my children the opportunity to choose how active they feel like being at any given time. For me, it's not about how much or how little television they watch and setting arbitrary limits to achieve perfection. It's about their relationships with television, which are already healthy.

1. I watched the TV show Barney until I was in 3rd grade. Yes, I could attribute that fact to having younger sisters (who were of appropriate age to be watching it), but it was really because I loved it.

The adventure aspect of the story takes a back seat to the romance/love triangle aspect, but this is still an exciting and engaging film. I particularly loved the scenes were Eloise Kelly was feeding the animals.

There are a couple of downfalls to Hybrid, however. The first is the Drone ability. As your kill streak grows, you unlock different robots that help you kill your enemies. While this is a cool idea on paper, it is annoying to have your enemy kill a noob teammate of yours a couple times, then unlock that scary wicked drone that hones in on you and kills you in one hit.
So I'm remembering the next time I doubt......come as children do, expect plenty, and know that I'm given all that I need.
The rule of law is obviously not part of Umno Baru culture. While proclaiming to the whole world that “demonstrasi luar kebudayaan kita”, Umno Baru and its allies have, since March 8, 2008, organised numerous illegal demonstrations in Pakatan-ruled states. Criminal intimidation is part and parcel of Umno Baru’s political strategy.

Let me also not forget to mention that this flick also has some very hard scenes to watch due to the extreme levels of torture that actually come around, especially one scene in particular that I refuse to say anything more about. These scenes were very effective but at the same time provided the biggest problems for me when it came to this flick. First of all, the conversations that these two have are effective enough so to just throw some torture in there seemed a bit like a cheat. Secondly, it was pretty obvious that Jeff would never really be able to do anything terrible to Hayley considering that Page was pretty young when this film was going on and I think that Slade would have had a lot more problems to deal with rather than just his subject material, if he showed anything that had her fully harmed in anyway.
In the next couple of weeks, I am expecting more changes to come. I will soon find out if/where we will be moving and once again, I am anticipating saying goodbye to many friends.
In addition to maintaining her GlutenFreeBaking website, giving GF cooking classes and demonstrations, and writing a weekly Gluten Free Tuesday column at Serious Eats, Elizabeth has been working on her second cookbook, "How to Cook Gluten-Free: Over 150 Recipes That Really Work", (Lake Isle Press, $27.95) which will be published later this month. Elizabeth sent me an email to ask if I'd join some other bloggers in a Cook Along event featuring several of the recipes from this new book and my immediate response was a high-pitched yipping that startled my sweet Martha dog awake from her guard position snoozing at my feet.

I know this sounds easier said than done, but I got so tired of being stressed in college, that I actually started getting my stuff done early. I won't harp on it, because you won't do it until you decide to make a change in yourself, but like making healthy choices- it will change your life.

The Ice Warriors look great in black and white. The lack of colour helps to attract attention to their crustiness and makes them look especially scary. It has been suggested that with the introduction of an officer class, a 'Davros Factor' was added, reducing the impact of the ordinary Ice Warriors. I am not so sure. With Davros, you had somebody who was not a Dalek bossing the Daleks around and thus making them look stupid. Slaar, on the other hand is very much one of the Ice Warriors, despite his differing armour. Alan Bennion at times gives Slaar an hilariously camp posture, though on the whole he is pretty menacing.

As a child, Alice was separated from her brothers and sisters; and therefore, her childhood was fragmented. She spend many years working through her bitter-sweet past until she reached absolution. This is the reason why she studied social care and became a social worker, she realised that she had become a wounded helper, someone who wanted to heal others as she had been healed herself. She believes that she would not have reached this point if there had not been other’s who listened to her and understood, who had healed their own wounds, just as she had done.
Happy Friday, everyone! Oh, it's not Friday, you say? Well it was my Friday 'cause I'm off the next two days. Hellz yeah. My day started off well with a nice 2 mile walk. We've been having some really crappy cold weather here this last week, but the sun was actually shining and it was warm enough to not have to wear a jacket, so I took advantage. I wouldn't call it exercise because walking doesn't ever get my heart rate up, but it burned a few extra calories. Always a good thing.

The headline act, the deep voiced comedian Tommy Dean was greeted on stage to a hearty applause and began to make funny observations about his life in Australia compared to his life in gun toting Arizona. Dean gave some very entertaining insight on how he came to live in Australia with his first wife the flight attendant and his life as a stay-at-home-dad of twins which can pose daily issues. To finish up Dean allowed the crowd some question time where he provided some quick witted improvisation and left everyone chuckling in their seats.

But between the weekends I slip into a sense of nothingness. And the anxiety grows. I know when I work my mind is occupied with love and care for mother nature. But at home my mind becomes anxious because I know I've discovered areas I don't in particular want to discover. And I know I am meant to work on them, but I run in the opposite direction.

And of course what's better is that these coupons encourage people to consume more. They pay for the coupons so they can have a bargain at a restaurant, and of course will use all of the coupons because they paid for them. Eat eat eat. Consume consume consume. Feed more oblivious cattle who feel they have "benefited" from your product, then invite some of this new American Cow to your cattle call to sell more. "Again, we're a legit business," he says. "Look for our seal on the back of the coupon sheet the next time someone comes to your door". Like hell I will - there won't be time to look for anything, as I will be too busy slamming the door.
Typical, oft depicted in movies, oft leading to bad lines and even worse small talk, sometimes they can turn up a diamond in the ruff.(shout out to cute Ian with glasses.

For all his many and various faults it's hard to escape the nagging confirmation that the idiot T.Aldous presided over a Golden Age. Sadly, so much of the managed change that could have eased the pain of the new horrors, or even forestalled some of them, were blocked as efficiently and ruthlessly as were all the other grim realities of the new millennium.

If you like the books — go see the movie just to see how the characters and action were portrayed in the film. Just be prepared for a slower, less detailed version of the book. And if you’ve seen the movie but haven’t read the books — read the books. Always better. And that’s the case here.

Arthur and his knights had to eat their wild boar somewhere. I have a round table in my kitchen, but it wouldn’t seat many knights, and my “siege perilous” is a chair with a wonky leg rather than a magical seat where nobody dares to sit. Anyway, I’ve never seen the Grail appear floating above it in a ray of light… at least not yet.
But there is a difference between the technological innovation that was movable type for the printing press and today’s innovations. When publishing as a potentially viable business venture first exploded in the West as a result of Gutenberg, Caxton et al, it was absolutely clear how the printer/publisher was going to monetize their investment and activities to receive a satisfactory ROI. Usually the printer and the publisher were one and the same person. With that new technology one copy was turned to multiple copies, quickly, and at a price the market was prepared to bear, as they were a fraction of the price of copies produced in scriptoria. There was a time-rich market hungry for printed entertainment and information product and with no alternative options for accessing content, and few distractions from that content. Which was a price-to-market revolution that was mirrored in a small way centuries later with the arrival of mass-market paperbacks).

According to New York Magazine, back in 2008, Plesner's failure to respond to the letter sent by Louis Vuitton prompted the company to go to court and seek injunctive relief, not damages (though I suspect that from Plesner's point of view, the latter would have preferable to restrictions on her freedom of expression). At the time, the plaintiff made two valid points: firstly, the need to uphold the rights of fellow artists Marc Jacobs and Takashi Murakami and secondly, the reality (both practical and legal) that if it didn't act to protect intellectual property rights, such rights would be jeopardised in the future. Whether these arguments were at the forefront of their actions is a different matter of course (there's little doubt that LVMH had, and still has, no interest in seeing its handbag portrayed in the context of the Darfur genocide).
I am feeling off, people. Off, a little off kilter, a little off balance, a little unmoored. I should really plot these on a calendar. Even though I am not back to periods yet, I bet I have some sort of cyclic hormonal something-or-other that is making me periodically blueish. I joked with my sister that if I breast feed long enough, I can just segue into menopause. But really, I swear it is a joke.

The big JC was a pretty cool guy. He was a hot Jewish bohemian who was like totes happy to share what he had with others, and also had the whole beard thing going on since back in the day. It probably would have been well annoying to hang out with all his creepy weirdo disciples, but no doubt some of them could have been bribed to fuck right off (I’m looking at you here, Judas). Anyway, Jesus had a nice line in artisan-crafted leather sandals, and obviously his step-dad could have banged together a right tidy wooden plan-chest for the studio if needed. We also have Jesus to thank for this glorious four-day weekend, so be grateful and share those bloody Mini Eggs. Kate Love is as big a fan as I am of our Lord, so this post is for her!

The book of Romans is a personal letter from the Apostle Paul to the church in Rome. The Roman church was a diverse congregation including both Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews). At the time that Paul wrote, this was the question that dominated the church: Can you be a full follower of Christ without becoming a Jew? Do you have to follow the Law of Moses (the Jewish Law) to receive Jesus’ blessings? Or put another way: “Can a non-Jews inherit the promises of Abraham or is his promises only for his physical descendants (ethnic Jews)?” To answer that question Paul is going to hold up Abraham as an example of what it means to be a true child of God or “heirs of the promise.”
I am glad that I had the chance to see Wiebo’s War, and to meet the Ludwigs. It made me wonder whether I would ever have the strength of conviction they show. They stood firm in their views in spite of police searches, ostracism and hatred. They stood firm in spite of a jail sentence. I’m not sure I could handle it as well as they have.
These safety glasses are an excellent deal. Rubber tipped temples and a rubber nosepiece make these glasses very comfortable. I use ear protection that presses on the temples which would cause my ears to hurt because my old safety glasses were plastic all the way around. The rubber on these glasses collapse and contour to my temple area. They allow me to wear ear protection for a long period of time without any pain.Also, the polycarbonate lens are excellent. They meet or exceed ANSI Z87.1 standards and they block 99.9% of UV rays. They do produce a slight tint, so if you are working indoors you will need good lighting. Overall, great glasses at a great price.

As Xu Guan fiddled with a loose thread dangling from the United Nations tape, he made a decision. He needed cover and concealment. Many of the houses might still be occupied. The maintenance shed was probably looted months ago, but it was less likely to be occupied than the nearby homes. Xu Guan dropped tossed uniform on the ground and removed his hospital gown. With his head on a swivel, Xu Guan slipped into the camouflage pants. As he reached for the uniform’s top, the loose thread that he had been twirling around his finger moments before caught on a branch half-buried in the ground. Xu Guan tugged at the jacket. The United Nations patch gave way as the stick ripped loose several of the threads. Xu Guan slipped into the jacket, buttoned it up and then looked down to note the dangling name tape.

This movie is also very bizarre and at times surreal when you see what kind of psychological effects the brainwashing has had on Noriko and Yuka, but it is all leading up to the end in a sort of dark and twisted story of self discovery for the two sisters. Through the tragic and extreme psychological situations they are put through, they ultimately find out some things about themselves and sort of transcend the whole ordeal in the ending. But it isn’t so much a happy ending where the whole family is reunited and they live happily ever after, because they have been through so much that you can see it is impossible for them to ever go back to being who they were. If it seems like any kind of description of this movie is elusive or not making much sense then that is because the movie is the same way. It is one you have to pay close attention to and watch several times to get some things you may have missed during the first go around, but as dark and depressing as this movie is I am guessing that for some watching once might be enough.
Ok, I will give you a small glimpse of some of the emotional/mental stuff. On one of my rides last week I was thinking about my physical condition, where my determination had gone, how I looked this time last year and just how so very much has happened in the last 6 months. That took me to where my health is physically/mentally, etc. I realized not only do I have 2 sweet boys watching and learning from me; I have Selah cheering me on in Heaven. Boy did that spark my fire.

British paramilitaries are largely of the same cultural DNA as the paramilitaries that were party to the Troubles and could be expected to conduct themselves similarly if faced with similar opponents. However, Muslims have a cultural DNA all their own, as we have already shown, and this bodes ill for our Muslim Troubles. Though it is probable that, in the early stages of the conflict, British paramilitaries will make at least some attempts to focus their attacks on adult Muslim males, any indiscriminate attacks on British targets that include large numbers of women and children will likely shred whatever restraint British paramilitaries may have felt inclined to exercise in this regard. We observe that the three reasons given for the greater ruthlessness of the loyalist paramilitaries above will all obtain in our Muslim Troubles: British paramilitaries will find it difficult to identify key figures in Muslim paramilitaries, British paramilitaries will not be aiming for a negotiated settlement with Muslims in which they must present themselves as being ‘civilized,’ and British paramilitaries will not be looking to a political future in which they and Muslims cooperate amicably subsequent to the creation of a new political reality. Rather, British paramilitaries will consider themselves, accurately in our opinion, to be resisting the dispossession of their people by a hostile, religiously-motivated tribe that can create only violence, savagery and madness. Psychological restraints on their violence will therefore be weak to begin with, and must be expected to disappear entirely if Muslims act in the way that they always seem to.
The current college generation is full of movers and shakers. I'm so tired of hearing people complain about today's youth. As someone who works closely with college students every single day, I can tell you that many of them are incredibly thoughtful, creative, dedicated, and resilient. Sure, they're attached to their phones, but that doesn't make them ungrateful or entitled. This generation has their own identity, and I think we need to spend more time appreciating it than criticizing it.

Wildcat just NEEDED to call his Sunday school teacher because she was just the right person to fix this situation. She talked to Wildcat and sure enough today, she made sure to investigate that situation. What a great lesson for Wildcat to learn. You can call on others in the body of Christ when you need help with your faith.

I dropped her off, and actually run away, like I thought I was going to escape this conversation somehow.

This year Erin has been asking for a Wii. We weren't really sure we could swing it so we told her that she shouldn't count on getting one. Since we usually splurge on one big gift, I convinced David that this would work. He is concerned about Erin (or perhaps me?) accidentally throwing the Wii controller into our tv. I told him we could put a Wii in our front bedroom which doubles as an office, but that means buying a new tv, or that we could enforce a rule that the wristlet attached to the controller always be worn if we put it into our family room.

The book also explores some of the personalities of those who have pioneered new ways of profiting from IP following Kevin Rivette's and David Kline's "Rembrandts in the Attic: Unlocking the Hidden Value of Patents." (It seems that many of those profiled like to travel, drive fast cars, and exercise compulsively.) Alex Poltorak starts his essay "On Patent Trolls and Other Myths" with poetic license. "Today, corporate fathers read their children scary stories before kissing them goodnight, the stories about demon patent trolls that terrorize the noble business folk," he writes in the introduction to his "Ballad of the Patent Troll." But perhaps Dan McCurdy of ThinkFire sums it up best when he concludes his essay on "Seeing through the Illusion of Exclusion" with

“Cabin in the Woods” is partly a classic tale of a group of teenagers who take a vacation in the woods, only to be met with a gruesome fate. Dana (Kristen Connolly), Curt (Chris Hemsworth), Jules (Anna Hutchison), Marty (Fran Kranz), and Holden (Jesse Williams) take a break from school to stay in a cabin deep in the woods. They party, swim in the lake, and do all the things one would expect students on break to do. However, while each character seems to represent an archetype, they are also developed beyond that. For example, Curt, the seemingly jock character, is on academic scholarship, and Anna, the girl voted most likely to get naked in the first act, is pre-med. The group of five friends can easily stand in for any group of friends in the real world. Their genuine friendship rolls off the screen and the audience can actually feel the love they hold for one another, a factor that is glaringly missing from the majority of horror films.

Living in Singapore, I’ve come to rely on taxis. What my husband has shown me is how easy it is to talk to taxi drivers. It’s a common enough reaction of expats to generalize that Singaporeans love to know your business. They have no qualms asking how much rent you pay, what kind of car you drive, why you are in Singapore, etc.

Piper’s building had an elevator but like most everything else in Washington Heights it was out of order. Marley pondered the tiny mosaic tiles along the landings as the three of them walked up the four flights of stairs to Piper’s apartment, silently marveling at how every building in the neighborhood was exactly the same. Same tiles. Same geometric pattern in the tiles. Same shit colored paint on the banisters and handrails. Same mud colored paint on the walls. The same tiny crack vials hiding in the crevices of the stairs leading up to the fifth floor and like all the other buildings in Washington Heights Marley didn’t have to see the roof to know it was carpeted with them.

I am a ending my sophomore year at Northern Arizona University. I am a civil engineering student. For those who really don’t know what civil engineering is, well look it up. Just Kidding! I need something to write about here. Civil engineering is a really wide category, one wouldn’t think of it as so (I didn’t). However, it can range from designing highways to buildings to factories. (Also there are emphasizes ranging from just structures or something like earthquake structures to highways/traffic to hydrology) The design of the building isn’t always the right word because architects can design what the structure looks like (I think most of the time). Civils go in and have to find if the design of the structure is able to withstand any of the geological “problems” if any in that area, then connect it to the sewer system, electrical grid (and where to place the wiring), plumbing and the insides & tiny details that go into any structure.

For many years he was my support. He became my critic. Like an angry father (or maybe a spurned lover? How sad, that these are associated inextricably with bad behavior!) he indulged in petty spitefulness and acts of sabotage that only made things harder. I pointed it out to him and he nonpologized — and escalated. I withdrew, and he escalated some more.
I quickly folded spellwork into my anti-anxiety regime. Doing a spell to ward against something was like not stepping on cracks or counting the number of times I did things, it was just something I did to make it easier to avoid obsessing.

Any way I'm sure I'm not the only one that has had to cross this path at some stage. I told my daughter that I was trying to make it easier on them for when I died. She said that they will still probably fight over some of my goodies. *Laughs* Below is a collection of photos that I took so that you can see my befores and afters. I thought that a little plan of the garage might help you better visualize just how it all fits into my box.
...we can put on our "Christian face" outside the home, but with our families, our true character often comes out. This is especially true in the two areas of sin we will look at in this chapter: impatience and irritability.
Oh, boy. If I were to write a whole answer to this, it would be an essay! But the short answer is that I believe in radical decentralization, the rebirth of autonomous communities, and true sustainability. I believe in a deep respect for the land that supports us, and would love to see an end to totalitarianism, patriarchy, colonialism, and the destruction of the earth. Again, I feel like this doesn't say nearly enough, but I think It's the best I can do in a simple question/answer format...
After a month and a half of working for us, she made up a lie that she was drunk and couldn’t come home (!) on her off day. We realized a day later that was a plot she made up in order to distract us from the fact that she was actually on a flight to Turkey. She escaped leaving most of her belongings in our house. She took some of her things and made up a lie as to why she was taking them. It looks like she wanted to work in Turkey, I am guessing not as a nanny, and she used us to get out of the Philipines (since Filipinos cannot leave their country now without a valid contract etc). She took our money. She had us pay for her ticket. She took advantage of us. I am just glad we only spent one and a half months with such an evil person living with us and not a year or two.

And it smells so good that it practically qualifies as edible potpourri.

However these systems are still present handicaps to development. Friction in the valve seals and the valve block, will create heat and variances in the systems response. This heat will be an enemy of the system, as it effect on the volume of fluid in the system, thus the stiffness the system provides to the suspension will alter. As a result the system will need to be a ‘constant volume’ system. Where the volume of fluid is managed depending on its rate of thermal expansion. This is probably part of the function of the small reservoir mounted to the valve block.
It is recognised by almost everyone that colonialism is a bad thing. They teach this in the schools in England. We have also been taught that colonialism in Ghana ended 50 years ago when Nkrumah won independence. Colonialism certainly ended but now appears to be continuing under a different name.

In the evening I went to something quite interesting. For a while now I’ve been pretty into BBC’s Sherlock TV-series and throug Tumblr I encountered the Finnish fandom. I must honestly say I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fandom that active before. They’ve had the creators of the series retweet some of the things they’ve done. Seen a random “I believe in Sherlock Holmes” poster hanging around? That would be them.

So I bought him what DH and I call a “chew,” those ropes tied with knots that our dogs love to chomp and tear through the house swinging and tossing in the air. I still got bit, but the sting was somewhat softened when, a few seconds later, T removed himself from my arm, grabbed the chew I offered with his teeth – and tossed it in the air.
These movies sometimes get unfairly looked down upon, but you know something? They’re still entertaining little curios, novelty or not. For singing dwarf cowboys, conjoined twin murder trials, and a buffet of international eccentricities check out The Terror of Tiny Town, Chained for Life, and Mondo Cane.
It can be very helpful to incorporate mindful techniques into our lifestyle: meditation, being together in nature, sitting and talking quietly together.

Overall, shipments from the brewery were up 22 percent with the brewhouse limited by fermentation capacity for much of the period. Sales of Saint Arnold brand beers were up 50 percent from the same period in 2010 at the distributor level as distributor inventories were depleted severely. Shipments related to the brewery’s brands that are sold primarily at BJ’s restaurants decreased as the brewery shifted more of its capacity to its Saint Arnold brands. By market, sales of Saint Arnold in San Antonio surged 102 percent over the same period in 2010, followed by Dallas/Fort Worth, up 66 percent. Houston was up 51 percent, while Austin was up 44 percent.

Little E was always a sweet, kind little boy and reflected that behavior when he used to go to daycare.We never had any problems with him.Then before turning three I pulled him out and he stayed home with me. To prepare him for school next year, I placed him in VPK at a really nice montessori based daycare/preschool. Since then he has complained about other boys treating him unfairly and excluding him.The teachers have not complained about him being bad to anyone at school, but who knows.
The last time I took a major inventory of my shoe closet was right before I moved into my current apartment. I noticed that I had my shoes from prom still and like 10 pairs of black heels. I mean, really black is great – but that’s just not necessary, especially considering the rest of my wardrobe didn’t reflect this awesome love for black. So I made some hard decisions. My prom shoes may have still been in perfect condition, but I hadn’t worn them since high school and it made no sense for me to still have them. I had pictures with them – it was time to give up the ghost.

So yesterday afternoon, around three p.m. I decided to make my family a homemade vegetarian pizza and garlic fingers with whole wheat crust, it was also around that time that my husband decided to go down into the rec room and immerse himself in Turbo Jam (he's lost nearly 20lbs already, very proud of him!). So that leaves the dilemma, who will watch the princess? Being the eldest, Logan always gets nominated for these types of jobs. He's an amazing older brother and really loves spending quality time with his siblings.

I like this tying together of the religious pattern of life with the agricultural way of life. Even if I no longer follow the Catholic faith, I understand the rhythms and meaning behind it, and I really like seeing how it is based on the seasons. It's the pattern of the year, and finding the right pattern that makes how we live make sense, is important to me. I want to live more in the seasons, acknowledging the ebb and flow of life around me, especially here in the city where I have to look a little harder to see it. I really like what she says about resolutions growing better now, as we plant seeds and see life blossom all around us. It makes more sense. I have to wait until the long weekend in May before I can plant any new seeds, roots or bulbs in my garden - we can have frost as late as that, here. Until then, however, I will be watching my lilac tree blossom, my irises and garden come to life.
Now, I will say that Brooke was wrong to go to the school when she was ordered to stay away. So, I think she loses on the firing part. However, she wouldn’t have been fired if she wasn’t suspended in the first place. She capitalized on a teachable moment in her classroom. I mean if you’re teaching journalism, hello, current events are going to come up. We can’t pick and choose the news as it happens. Also, Michigan’s department of ed standards emphasize real-world applications. How more into the real world can you get? EVERYONE is talking about Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin. Do you honestly think children aren’t going to have questions? As a school with an overwhelming majority of black students, honestly, you should have been ready for such an event.

But, here I am. I subbed for three years after getting my bachelor's degree before working as an instructional assistant and before I had my teaching degree. It's a little weird to return to subbing in regular classrooms after five years! BUT let me tell you, I LOVE subbing. For real, it's a great gig. I have freedom from planning, grading, and real/prolonged discipline problems. I get the chance to work with a daily variety of ages and learners and the opportunity to watch great teachers do their thing and learn from them! It's rewarding each day to get to know new students, problem solve, present unfamiliar material and take each day as it comes. Now if only subs were paid accordingly...
I plan for a simpler, less stressful Christmas season and, every year, by Christmas Eve I'm exhausted! After our delicious and very-time-consuming-to-make traditional Swedish meal to honor my husband¹s relatives (think: Vikings), it's time to head to church. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but the last few Christmas Eve's, I have sent my husband and kids head off without me. The pull to spend an hour of quiet in the house feels as strong as a magnet.
So, I need to turn my foolish little expectations on their heads. Let's see what that looks like:

Needless to say, the city council voted unanimously against the proposal. Not much discussion. A lot of yelling and a lot of screaming and the city council said no to the proposition. No sooner had they voted that the back doors of the auditorium were opened and in came Mother Teresa. She was in town for a ceremony dedicating a Sisters of Charity program and she heard about this meeting. She came down the center aisle and everybody gasped as Mother Teresa came to the front, got down on her knees in front of the city council, raised her arms and said, “In the name of Jesus, make room for these children of God! When you reject them, you reject Jesus. When you affirm them, you embrace Jesus.” And then with her arms upraised, five times in a row she said, “Please, please, please, please, please, in the name of God, make room for these people! Make room for them in your neighborhoods.”
And it’s because of this that I’ve realized that not only do I really, REALLY like the ending, I think it has to be said that the ending of Mass Effect 3 is one of the best endings that any story has every climaxed in. After thinking about it, I started to realize that I do like the game’s ending and it’s for a much different reason than why I wanted to like it. I have a lot of faith in humanity and I thought that the amount of hate that blossomed on the Internet for this game’s ending meant that most people had already analyzed it by many different angles and understood its nuance and STILL didn’t like the ending. This meant that there should be no saving grace and to enjoy the ending you would have to simply enjoy a more sparse ending, take it in and accept it for what it is, rather than what it’s missing — creative white space, to borrow a term from my profession as a newspaper editor/designer. But, the more you think about the ending, the more you realize that what I assume is the Indoctrination theory (I’ve seen it in google searches but have tried to avoid sullying my thoughts anymore by the profound stupidity of the Internet and thus have not read up on it) is really the only explanation and it’s, really, quite obvious.

But the alternative (that isn't an alternative), Huh , who cares, I know what I mean when I say "good". I know what I like. That's an asocial, narcissistic way of looking at things, isn't it?

On my end, I've created this "New House Scorecard" spredsheet that has a list of subjective criteria (ex. "Style of home") that can be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 and then more objective stuff (ex. His/Hers Closets in Master) that is given a point value like +10 points the house has it, -10 if it doesn't. The moer important the item is, the higher the point value. Dorky? Yes. But I'm hoping that it will help us when we start looking for a new place in earnest.

The finished beer has some mild American hop aroma and bitterness. However, the star of the show turned out to be the malt. A base of Marris Otter along with crystal malts and about 5% victory malt created a wonderful toasty/buscuity malt presence. The White Labs WLP 001 yeast lived up to its claims and left behind a nice clean malt profile with very low esters and some noticeable hop character.

It's not that I was new to Christianity when I walked through the gates of Fair Glen. We were a god-fearing family. When I was little, my mother played the organ at the Anglican church and I helped by putting the hymn numbers up in the hardwood display boards. My Gram was a fire and brimstone Baptist who made sure I attended Pioneer Girls. She was also responsible for the various illustrated editions of the Bible we had kicking around the house. And yet, Christianity was quietly observed in my family, my mother being more a disciple of C.S. Lewis than any kind of organized doctrine.

The future? The book gives us a big hint at an Apple television, which would fit the formula very well. The increasing complexity of our user experience of television (when linked to the web) – just like music downloads 10 years ago – is a classic opportunity for Apple. My VirginMedia Tivo box, for example, works well enough as a machine, but the human interface is poorly considered. An Apple TV would also connect seamlessly (two key Apple words) with iTunes online selling and distribution of video content. The iMac design is already a television by another name without a purpose-designed user interface, and the high screen resolution of the iPad 3 is a bravura display of what Apple can do.

A democracy as deduced by the populace who, all for active activism aiming to infiltrate into a course called governance, are presuming that a majority decision will be fair. I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who observed that Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for dinner. And mistakenly so, the entire concept of administration is falling apart courtesy footloose activist thriving largely on polity, a nation’s mass hodgepodging the very ideas of jingoism and rationality and the oblivious government shambling through its log of scams and unattended primacy.

Spend several days to one week seeking out kitchen professionals online who capture your interest. Doing preliminary research online will tell you volumes about individual kitchen designers and kitchen design firms as you look at photos of completed projects and read about their overall design approach. Become familiar with accreditation and understand what they represent in terms of knowledge and experience, particularly if they include National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA) credentials such as Certified Kitchen Designer (CKD). The NKBA.org website is a good starting point for your search and will describe the various credentials in detail. Ideally, come up with a total of five or six designers or design firms to contact.

Just wanted to take this opportunity to thank Erin at House of Turquoise for featuring Tate's nursery on her blog today. I was honored to have so much positive feedback, and even more delighted that she chose to feature it. Its special to me to be featured on House of Turquoise since it was the very first design blog I ever discovered, and the only one I followed for a long time. I stumbled across Erin's blog about three years ago when I was looking for inspirational kitchen photos. When I got there, I found a lot more than beautiful kitchens, and had so much fun looking through the collection of gorgeous interiors. I knew immediately that Erin had great taste and an incredible eye for good design, and checking in with her blog every morning became just as regular as my morning coffee.
While you are all set for the big shopping, the first thing that you must do is to set a budget. The ultimate aim of the shopping would be to look god, but that doesn't mean that the dress should cause a hole in your pocket. Once you have the budget, it is better to start the shopping for the prom dresses at least one month in advance. Last minute shopping is absolutely not a right thing to do. Also the shopping program should kick off with proper prior research. You should know that there are many physical as well as online stores that offer wide variety of plus size prom dresses. They would be completely dedicated to plus size apparels. It is also a good idea to rummage the fashion magazines and newspapers. If you are acquainted with a professional, you can also seek their advice on the latest trends.

It was so special for me to be able to celebrate Mother's Day with all these great women in my family, especially my grandma! She is so loving, kind, and fun to be around, even in her 80's! I'm so thankful for her, and the legacy that she has created in our family. She was looking so snazzy on Mother's Day in her pink shirt, and I'm still smiling about the fact that we got to spend the day together! We spent some of the day at the hospital, and it was great to be able to visit with Dot and wish her a happy Mother's Day as well. Later in the afternoon, Grandma, Aunt Harriet, and I got to do a little shopping, which was really fun!

However, there is a downside to mania. I spent money like water running through my fingers; I once bought a house, ten's of thousands' more than we could afford; without my husband even seeing it! I've bought several cars without consulting my husband, and on and on. The odd thing about inappropriate mania is that it is never enough. The hoards of boxes that would arrive at my door from purchases would go unopened for weeks ~ because I knew what was in them, and it was to act of buying not owning that fed my high.
Also, a guy named Gary contacted me through my WordPress blog; apparently he is the guy who takes pictures and videos of the cats at the shelter. I told him we were interested in branching out to YouTube and Flickr, but Chelsea, Matt, and I didn’t have the time. Gary was on it! He started a YouTube channel for the shelter immediately. It was really cool to communicate with others who volunteered at the shelter and throw around ideas. One week I had a suggestion, the next moment Gary had implemented it.

Much happens to Rebus in this book, the least of which is a nice relaxing massage. He's thrown out by his live-in girlfriend, Dr. Patience Aitken, so he moves back into his own flat. But because he's been renting it to students, Rebus ends up on the couch. Even a small storage room is being used -- his brother, a former drug dealer, has just moved into the apartment, as well.
It is important to emphasise that such as the proposed securitisation would be grounded in successive batches of “clean” mortgages with prudent loan-to-value ratios deriving from true economic value supported by sustainable purchaser earnings and meaningful equity. Such securities would be readily convertible to cash in the financial markets.
Sara (Scottie Thompson) has it all. She’s a high-powered attorney with a successful boyfriend (Casper Van Dien), who is climbing her way to the top and enjoying life in the big city. Just after receiving the biggest case of her career and hints from her boss that the is on track to become a partner in the firm, Sara receives a call from her younger sister Lily (Madeline Zima), with shocking news that their father (Jeff Fahey) has died. Sara, with work in hand, returns to her childhood home on the enchanting Smith Mountain Lake to attend her father’s funeral and help her sister and mother (Jane Seymour) settle the family estate.

I spent the spring break of my junior year of college working at an elementary school on a Cree reservation in central Alberta. Though most of the white farmers in the surrounding country were Protestants, most of the Cree themselves seemed to be Roman Catholics. They were therefore sacramentalists. The difference made an impression on me at the time, but I couldn’t plumb the wherefore of it. It’s interesting to note that while Charles Eastman converted to a non-sacramentalist Protestantism which he never seems to have felt really comfortable with, Black Elk converted to Catholicism and spent the last decades of his life as a pious and successful lay catechist.
Me: So if all of these people who were good people, who were productive members of society, they will burn in hell, all because of an accident of birth? That seems like a pretty f**ked up system. But what about newborns who die suddenly? Or just children who were never old enough and never had the mental faculties to understand Christianity? Are they damned to hell too?

What is freaking me out now, as I write this, is the knowledge that 48 hours from now I'll be ass deep in crumpled newspaper and broken-down cardboard boxes while I unpack everything I've so laboriously wrapped and stuffed and taped and heaved. I don't think I'll be wondering too much about "why the hell did I keep this?" because I've been fairly brutal in winnowing out the unwanted and unneeded. And there should be a lot more room for putting things away--more cupboards, more closet space, and simply more room. I'll be able to walk around my bed and tuck in the sheets on the far side!

I wonder how this might affect brands or other habits. For example, we know things like obesity cluster around networks but could quitting also follow the same pattern? Or brand aficionados – for example iPhone die hards – the social effect is sticky to begin with, but if people start to leave then ‘quitting momentum’ could build. On social media the momentum can be dramatic: the rise and fall of MySpace took place over a timeline you’d more usually expect for a boy band.

I see free and open source software (FOSS) as the best alternative. For example, why risk yourself by using illegally acquired Windows OS when you can use Linux or FreeBSD? There are many free OS available. However, I don’t discount the fact that many users are familiar to Windows environment than any other operating system. But for users who prefer to do what is right, what is legal, and what moral, he will find ways to learn linux – that is if he can’t afford Windows OS.

As I work through my taco-stained notes from last week’s South by Southwest Interactive conference, a few things stand out. First, as you can infer from the title of this post, the tension between Austin’s liberal, progressive spirit and the hyper-corporatization of SXSW has never been higher or more absurd. It’s jarring to leave a keynote about Code for America and wander into a parking-lot sized space/rave/igloo tent promoting Nokia. Or to hear Girl Talk - an exemplar of Creative Commons-enabled remix culture – blasting from the speakers of the “Today Show” food truck as they dispense free breakfast tacos (using a recipe from Top Chef star ______!).
"Often regarded as the quintessential group of the Paisley Underground-movement, The Dream Syndicate might have been the band that had the least in common with the other units. Most of those bands were based in Los Angeles (or relocated there) and shared a love for late ‘60’s rock, preferably of the psychedelic kind (The Byrds, The Doors, The Beatles, etc.). However, only a few bands (the Rain Parade, The Three O’Clock) never got rid of that tag, as Green on Red quickly moved into rootsier territory, The Bangles actually sounded as if they should’ve called themselves The Jangles, while The Dream Syndicate combined the sonic experimentation of the Velvet Underground (White Light/White Heat-period) and the adventurous rock of mid-‘60’s Dylan with the urgency and rawness of punk rock, while defying that genre’s stylistic essence with groove-based songs, strangled guitar solos and a proneness to extended noisy jams (especially on stage). While the VU-comparison has become an annoying truism in the meantime, front man Steve Wynn’s nasal vocals, limited range and slightly macabre lyrics did warrant the Lou Reed-similarity for lack of a better point of reference. Whatever their intentions were, it’s hard to deny that this quartet delivered the songs to back up the statement they were a band with more than enough personality of their own. (...) The Days of Wine and Roses hardly sounds like the firstborn of a beginning band. Granted, they seem to rely more on instinct and texture than on technique at this point, but at the same time, Precoda’s feedback-drenched guitar chops are simply amazing, much in the way Neil Young, Sterling Morrison or Greg Sage - all guitarists that disband flashiness in favor of emotional density and/or angular and ragged freak-outs – constantly hovered on the verge of chaos. (...) The Days of Wine and Roses never got the credit Murmur, Zen Arcade or Daydream Nation got, but that doesn’t really matter anymore. The what if? - and why not? - questions are superfluous. It’s simply a benchmark recording, one that seemed nearly impossible to measure up to, even for an excellent songwriter like Wynn, and one that still deserves to be heard by any fan of inspired guitar-based rock".

What am I feeding my soul with? Well, up until the first of the year, not much. I would read the Bible but not spend the time to really study it's content. It was not so much a love letter to me as it was a quick reference guide. In order to grow, I knew that had to change. I dedicated the next 12 months to learning 24 Bible verses. That's 2 a month. Now, for someone that can't even remember her husband's cell phone number (speed dial #2, thanks so much), this was a daunting task. But, I gave it to God and away I went. I am actually doing pretty well! I got a little enthusiastic with a couple and I am still trying to learn them, so I decided to keep to the shorter verses after that.
I got up and washed my face, bringing back a warm, damp washcloth for her. We lay propped up on pillows and looked down at ourselves, at each other’s bare flesh. My cock had been hard before but was drooping now, and her fingers circled, squeezing gently, and we both watched as the head became engorged again, the shaft began to thicken and straighten in her hand.

Okay, this is strictly not from the past week but since it was never covered in domestic media, I think it’s worth a mention. It’s from the continuing series of bankruptcy hearings for David Drumm, the former Anglo CEO, and this one is from the hearing in January 2012 when David’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the bankruptcy official’s challenge to David’s bankruptcy should be thrown out because papers were electronically delivered to the court at 5.21pm on a deadline day, when the court office closed at 4.30pm. The judge sided with the bankruptcy official and allowed the challenge to proceed which means that David faces challenges from both Anglo AND now the bankruptcy official which prompted David’s lawyer, Francis Morrissey to complain that his client’s interests were being prejudiced by having to deal with two sets of opponent’s lawyers. And when Anglo’s lawyer, Ken Leonetti, sought to address the court, up popped Francis with the above example of argument they don’t teach you at law school. The judge wasn’t impressed and David now faces another year of uncertainty before a hearing next January will decide if he can be discharged from bankruptcy.
“Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men’s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organised, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.” – Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States (1856-1924)

I wanted to throw in elements used in Rick Owens' collections like dark denim to help create the illusion. I like pairing my black denim vest over my blue denim jacket because you don't really see those two so closely paired. Despite the Rick Owens fuel, to me, this outfit looks more like a Karlheinz Weinberger subject, which is fine too. Kind of a wordy post for a casual outfit but I think it's fun to retrace my thought process.

Hyatt then appealed to the Federal Circuit. In an en banc ruling, the appeals court ruled that a plaintiff in a Section 145 action may introduce any evidence in support of its request for issuance, even though the evidence was not before the BPAI. Hyatt v. Kappos, 625 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2010)(en banc). The USPTO argued for a different rule that would preclude admission of new evidence in the district court action unless the applicant could not reasonably have provided the evidence to the USPTO in the first instance. Supreme Court will be tasked with determining the correct standard for admitting new evidence.

If the family is not on board, well, explain to them why you're going paleo (and who can argue with a happier, healthier parent and spouse!), and that you need them to support you. This means, they eat what you cook. If they choose to fill their bodies with things you can no longer eat, have them NOT bother YOU with it. They're perfectly capable of eating crackers and cookies without your help. ;)
The Internet, or 'Net', stands for Interconnection of Computer Networks. It is a massive conglomeration of millions of computers and smartphone devices, all connected by wires and wireless signals. Although it started in the 1960's as a military experiment in communication, the Net evolved into a public free broadcast forum in the 70's and 80's. No single authority owns or controls the Internet. No single set of laws governs its content. You connect to the Internet through a private Internet service provider, a public Wi-Fi network, or through your office's network.

This tale is about what constitutes helping/neighborliness. A brother and sister argue over whether money is sufficient giving or it has to be more personal. This takes them back to an incident of giving in their childhood. And what constituted true giving for one, did not for the other. Interesting idea: do we differ in how we look at neighborliness, charity, giving. Patti

The aromas are of rich fig, caramel, coffee, nuts and raisins and it these same characters that dominate the palate. It is rich, but there is balance there from just enough fresh acidity. It only has 130grams per litre of residual sugar, so never seems sickly/LRS. I liked this, it was a very good Vin Santo indeed and it was perfect with the lovely Tuscan easter cakes we had for dessert, which were not unlike a Pannatone, so that combination would work too.

I have been blessed to have had several mentors in my professional life. I have been blessed by some people older than myself who by example instilled in me a regard for and understanding of not only the business of a business, but the humanity of a business; people who by example inspired me to learn from my mistakes, care about my reputation, conduct myself with honesty and passion, and strive to become a decent citizen of the world. By example, these people taught me, helped me, challenged me, and expected the best from me as they expected the best from themselves. They made me cry because they were tough. They made me laugh because they were playful. They made me think because they were thoughtful. They made me care because they were careful. And in the process, as I grew from being an assistant to a colleague to a peer, we became friends because we shared a deep mutual respect for our business, for one another, and for the future.
So we're going out for Jer's birthday celebration tomorrow night, as we had too many things going on today. One big thing that happened was that Connor had his dentist appointment, which went very well. We use a circular toothbrush with a rotating head for his daily dental hygiene (recommended by the dentist since his teeth are so small and far apart) and it's very similar to the cleaning tool that the dentist uses in her office. So he was extremely good for the cleaning, and it only took them about ten minutes to do the whole thing. He even opened his mouth on command. Way to go Connor!

At breaktime, at school, all I had time for was to eat a chocolate frog. One of my colleagues keeps a box of chocolate frogs (called Freddos) .. (the chocolate frogs, not the colleague) ... in the fridge and he doles them out to kids who have done something worthy. The only thing is, often the box is empty, because the rest of us filch them. In fact, it is Not the Done Thing to go into the fridge and help oneself to a Freddo without saying to everyone else, 'Anyone fancy a chocolate frog?' After we have got over the obligatory ribaldry about our tastes in partners, we all enjoy a bit of chocolate and then Period 3 with Year 10 and iambic pentameter doesn't seem quite so bad.

South Africa's revolution will follow a very similar path as revolutionaries would turn against each other and blacks will turn against blacks, which would result in self-annihilation, but in the meantime the whites would be gathered and hauled and killed in mass, while the World would stand on the side, watching and smiling, while the media would be clicking away with their cameras to preserve the memories of their ultimate triumph, the extermination of White South Africans.

I’ll stay until they stop playing. I’ll stay for every song. And, then, I’ll walk down the street to Cafe Du Monde and drink some cafe au lait and eat some beignets and go back to my hotel room, full of music and good food and more memories from New Orleans.
At this center, the children rolled a double dice (you can’t see it in this picture!), counted the number of dots and then counted that many candies onto the gingerbread man. Then they graphed what they rolled by dobbing the correct number. The candy is from a Lakeshore counting box.
So take some time today or tomorrow (but make it sometime soon) to practice “doing nothing”, and see how good it feels!

Like i said, am not taking sides, I have met many men in my life, my two brothers, some are my best friends, some have even been my lovers and i have honour to all of them. Most are good and I blend well with their company. They have been my soul mates and people I look up to. They always light up my days and put a smile on my face and thats one achievement anybody can ever have with me, making me smile genuinely. A few have made me feel loved, taken care of and appreciated me and my thanks to all of them.

By now you might want to cool your jets (if you’re jets need cooling) because I’m not going to argue any of these points with you. That’s not what this blog is about. It’s about being the salt of the Earth and more broadly, what we Atheists, Humanists and Secularists really expect from Theists of all stripes: Be Christlike and practice what you preach.
With Princess Marie at home, hopefully all cozy and comfy waiting for her baby to arrive, I was so happy to get a glimpse of a substitute tiara-sporting royal! This is Princess Elisabeth, first cousin of Queen Margrethe, and this is her sapphire tiara which came from Princess Thyra (a daughter of Frederik VIII) via her mother. Elisabeth never married and never had children, so many wonder if her jewels might make it back into the main royal line someday (long may she live, of course). In the mean time, she seems to be taking the Victoria route with her all blue sparkle. Well done!

All the papers are Momenta from the Seasons and Occasions pack (PA-1992), the black and white cardstock pack (PA-2390), and a photo mat pack. Stick pins are made by me for the one in the middle, and Maya Road for the green leafies. The metal tag is Making Memories and the chipboard is Cosmo Cricket. The circle tags are Colorbok. I used a Tim Holtz mask and Jenni Bowlin Weathered Wood paint dauber to do the edges and the clock.
The friend I’ve been working with is convinced the world is going to end in accordance with the Mayan Prophecy, but I think that, if anything, it’s a spiritual shift rather than a physical one. I guess we’ll see, but just like all the other ‘end of the world’ projections, predicting the future is a tenuous business. I know some people are determinists, but from my perspective, we’re creating the future with current actions (or inaction), and even then, life’s endless creativity is going to surprise all of us – especially the soothsayers who think they know/see all. It is so satisfying when arrogance gets its comeuppance!

I’ve had rumours spread about me – some of them actually make me laugh! I once heard that people thought that I was raped by my brother so I killed him and burned my house down and that’s why I moved city! I’m sorry, what? My brother raped me? How could he when he was barely seven at the time? And, the last time I checked, my house was still standing tall completely unaffected by flames. How that rumour spread, I haven’t the slightest clue but it’s ridiculous.
To the Race Event of the year! Merely by luck! I was dying to do The Color Run once I saw it on Pinterest. Checked the website and the local ones were either passed or not anywhere close to where we are/going to be. I was so bummed. And then Kansas City MO appeared. It is NO WHERE near where we will be living, BUT I have inlaws just a short drive from this. So I recruited my brother in law to do the fun with me. I checked the website to see when we could register and SOLD OUT. seriously this race sold out in ONE DAY. ONE. So tons of people begged and pleaded for an entire week and......

This was my first year of blogging and I have come a long way! I can't believe how much I have learned this year and how much I have grown. I am so grateful to the readers of this blog, my clients and all of the support I have been given. I feel blessed beyond words. Thank you!

For a moment, think about this question: “What if you could really have the life you’ve always wanted? What would it look like?” For some of you it would mean more. More of something. For others it would mean less. Less of something.
I had made an appointment to get the tires changed on the car, but the place I went to couldn’t fix it. Have to go to another place. Not sure where to go as it is not my car. Anyway today didn’t work out the way I thought. Lately very little seems to work out the way I plan. I have the feeling of being in the wrong place, out of place. Not sure about where I fit in. Never have been sure. Most of my life I’ve been out of place. Most of my life has been a struggle to find out where I belong. Haven’t really found out yet.

Just when we had them pegged as enigmatic figures from Iceland who crafted moody, atmospheric epics, Sigur Rós came out with “Gobbledigook” off of this year’s "Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust" (translated as With a Buzz in Our Ears We Play Endlessly), a buoyant number that employed manically strummed acoustic guitars, stomping percussion, and clipped chants that threw us for a loop. It, and the album on the whole, sounded like four guys joyously playing music together instead of mysterious elfin creatures who delivered it from on high. Whether carrying us into the heavens on the back of a titanic opus or keeping us tethered to the ground with more organic and intimate fare, Sigur Rós continues to coax the breath from our lungs while keeping our jaws on the floor.

While I have been very satisfied voyaging on the Dragon’s Revenge, I have decided to make this move to settle down and start my own family of sea dogs. The memories I have made, or was too drunk to remember, cannot be replaced by all the rubies and doubloons in all the world. I will never forget the throat cutting contests with Sammy Pegleg. Or the first time I kissed a bar wench without her permission. And let’s not forget the time we blew up that whale with a cannon. That was definitely worth the smell and the mess.
At this time he pleaded with me to stop writing the questions down. His attempts to grab my pen and notebook made the process more challenging that I was willing to put up with, so I acquiesced (NOTE: That's a really big word. Thanks, spell-checker, for your help.)
I planted a winter garden. I am praying, praying that it turns out to be a good thing, and even something I love. So far, I am thrilled with the progress, even though everything hasn't been perfect. (I grew weeds instead of spinach.) Somehow, I feel that the success or failure of the garden is tied to my future. It's a harbinger of things to come, or not to come. I need it to be a success.
Support is critical. Dog people are extremely supportive. Check out this card my trainer sent me when Mouse earned his companion dog title (below). My trainers are pretty darn awesome. In my group of friends in the dog community, we all treat each other like family. Even with friends across the country, they know that I'm available anytime of the day (literally) if they need me, and they are available anytime I need them. I remember being woken up one morning at 5 am to a phone call demanding that I evacuate to Virginia due to Hurricane Rita. If I didn't leave now and drive up to them, them were going to come down to get me. That's how much they cared, and that's how supportive they were. Another friend I met through my breed club was so supportive that two days prior to his passing, he emailed to congratulate my dog and I on our recent achievements. He never let on that his cancer had severely worsened, and even when he was the one in need of support; he thought of me first.

I know I need to continue with my PD trip post. Hopefully I will get to do that sometime next week. Esok dah busy kena teman hubs for his medical checkup in the morning. Then tengahari nak ke Klang for husband punye boss punya anak punya wedding. Hahhh, amik kau! Hehe. And kalau sempat, we really want to watch 'The Avengers' this weekend at the cinema. The last time I went to the cinema was in July 2009. Kalau tak silap I la. Gila lama weyhhhh. Must keep myself up-to-date with the surroundings haha.

I divided the water ratio. To the hot water, I added a pinch of saffron, stirring it with a spoon to release the yellow color. If you don't buy saffron, I am guessing you could use Tumeric. The purpose behind using saffron is to give the pasta a deep golden color. Skip it, if you'd like. I added 4 cups flour to the food processor. With the processor turned out, I slowly added 1 1/2 cups water and then 1/2 cup of saffron water.
Having now visited Nigeria for myself and observed different dimensions of Christian culture first-hand, I was interested to see how for so many people the external religious fabric of Christianity was interwoven and integrated with all manner of other ideas (and ideologies). It seems to be altogether too easy for many people to take the bits of Christianity that suit them and ignore the rest. However, that’s one thing if you keep your faith to yourself. For at least fifteen years, Nigerian churches have been sending missionaries into the West – and Britain and Europe have been very important to these missions. The Redeemed Christian Church of God is one such church which has broken into the ecclesial scene in the UK and is now systematically trying to crack Europe, learning some extremely painful lessons about how European minds process the relationship between theory and practice and how the West African cultural mindset is uniquely unprepared for long-term evangelistic success here in Europe when there is no diasporic African community to tap into.
The lady who schedules the appointments could sense that I was nervous about size. I told her my husband traced his hand and told me to give that to the doctor. Typical. She suggested I go to www.loveyourlook.com. Fortunately, I am an info junky and had already come across that website. It is a good one if you are trying to gage your results. However, I looked at so many boobs I was beginning to feel like a perv.
Once we got onto the 4WD track I start to enjoy the crazy ride, while Guido’s girlfriend seems to get greener in her face. With the cliff dropping hundreds of meters next to us, we drive up a rocky gravel road for about half an hour. While we get higher and higher up the mountain, the views get better and better. Still not knowing where exactly we are going, we arrive at a mountain hut in a place called Jovanna. It is Toni’s home. The hut is built with natural rock and cement and has a big wooden door. Inside he’s got a dining table with chairs on a cold stone floor and a big fireplace above which is a bull’s skull with boots hung up on the horns. There’s also a wheel barrow inside filled with wood. In the corner I discover a large jug filled up to the top with cork from whine bottles. The same moment Guido pours us a glass of red whine, supposedly the best red whine in all of Italy. We sit down in front of the fire trying to warm up. Meanwhile Toni and Guido’s girlfriend disappear upstairs and prepare our spaghetti.

She mentions the importance of keeping the spine aligned, as well as some ways to handle dizziness or vertigo. I can attest personally that the power of healing dreams increases with alignment. I joke that I’ve got my subconscious working overtime for me, but it’s true! I give it assignments to heal certain challenges in my life, and after some wild, yet related dreams, those specific issues make tangible progress in “real” life. Or should I say “waking life”? We are finally beginning to awaken in waking life!

So, yes, I'd started to feel the chafe of literary shackles on my wrists -- the need to be beautiful line-by-line, to rely on giving the gift of language while sacrificing story, to create an internal structure of images to support the work instead of deep characterization, etc... All of these good things that had kept me at the page for so very long -- they were oppressive.

Newsroom training has been a passion of mine since the mid-1990s, and I am pleased and proud that training plays such a prominent role in Digital First efforts to change our company’s business model, culture and workflow. I first discussed this plan with Matt on a visit to the Register Citizen in Torrington last June. As Matt acknowledged on Twitter today, the “ninja” concept is “super hokey.” But what’s super-important is that the ninja “belts” that journalists earn through the program are backed up by actual cash. A journalist earning all five belts will earn $2,000 in bonuses (to say nothing of the opportunities for advancing to positions that pay more.
Probably the neatest thing about catching up with our families through the 1940 federal census has been getting a sense of the folks who called Dover and New Philadelphia, Ohio home 72 years ago.
Amit Bansal answers, A very genuine query Ravi. Appreciate you asking this question. When you are offering reasons for not being able to achieve your targets you must also talk about the root cause analysis you may have done for the failure. You must also highlight your learning from that situation and how you could have done things differently to achieve the targets. The point here is not whether you will be able to achieve the targets with an improved plan or after doing the root cause analysis. But it highlights your ability to learn from your mistakes and a constant urge to achieve.
5.) YOU MUST BLOG HER!!! LOL! I should hope this would go without saying! But I'll say it, just so it's out there! If she comes to visit you, I want to know how she spent her time! I (for one) WILL be living vicariously through my friend!!!

The good news is, when I moved out of my house in AZ, I thought I hated all of my stuff. (Furnishings, decorations, etc.) But when I moved it all in here, I fell in love again! :) I think I was just out of love with our rental. Like, seriously.
