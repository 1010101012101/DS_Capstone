One last picture. Although most of the time he's kind of a dick, as I have mentioned, occasionally Simon manages to break out the cute.
This recent quote from Ira Glass, the host and producer of NPR’s This American Life, has been embraced by many in the creative fields. I’ve seen it pop up on a number of design and photography blogs I read for fun, but I think it’s just as relevant to those of us in the business world if you replace “good taste” with “vision.”

Somethings come easy for people, others it's hard, but if we give up we will never hear that beautiful music we all can create. Mr. Z never gave up and look at him now. He's playing music and sharing his love for music with the kids, but he is also teaching them something much more important. Never give up your dream, no matter how far a reach it may seem. And that is a powerful message.

My Personal Life: I love that 1) I have an amazing spiritual teacher who truly loves everyone and is the most moving embodiment of divine love I have ever encountered, and she loves me! 2) I’ve kept up with friends for many years even though we’ve been apart by wide distances and have wonderful long term friends, truly deep relationships, 3) I’m growing my relationship with my family–both immediate and extended.
Okay, so I’ll admit it. Despite what my comment in the Beastie’s post says, I’ll agree that LDR’s suck. Kind’ve.
The play I am currently involved in is a comedy. The story involves a property developer who wants to drive a lady out of her home so he can purchase the estate she lives in. My character is the very feisty lady who refuses to sell at any price. It all gets a bit 'Midsomer Murders' but the cast are having great fun at rehearsals. The play starts on March 9th so there are just under six weeks to go!
After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II, who had direct and intimate experience of Catholic loyalty, retained a sense of gratitude, evidenced by periodic attempts to reduce the penalties and restrictions with which the community was burdened. But his good intentions were invariably frustrated by a Parliament deeply hostile to the ‘recusants’, so called because of their refusal to attend Anglican services. They continued to be barred from public office and compelled to pay fines for non-attendance at church.

I colored the laces with a variety of orange shades and of course who could forget YR68? That color makes up mostly the toes and some of the sides. I did not seal the markers on the rubber surface or the laces. So some of it has rubbed of the toes a bit since I am tend to sometimes clip my own feet as I walk but so far the laces are doing great! And what can I say I am not afraid of wearing my white lined sneakers because they are no longer white anymore!!

The Norwegian Palestine Committee and the Socialist Youth in Trondheim don’t want to appear less eager than their comrades in the ‘Revolutionary Communist Youth’ and ‘Serve The People’ in their fight against Israel. The Trondheim chapter of SU reported with pride on their Twitter page on February 29, 2012 that:
Looky!!! Goober has starting laying!! She even made her own little nest in the garden under the fig tree. I never thought about providing her a nesting box because I didn't know if she would ever lay due to her breed. She lays a nice size egg and seems quite pleased with herself. Jack started giving her a little laying ration and I think that combined with walking around on dirt has strengthened her legs. She still has some trouble and sits a lot but is walking better.
In these lively cartoons, Jack Cole has returned to using wash techniques, as he did with his Boy's Life cartoons, although his technique (and drawing) has improved greatly. About 10 years later, he would publish numerous artful wash cartoons for the Abe Goodman Humorama magazines, among others.

These are available in the form of pills or in the form of a cream or lotion which you can apply directly on the pimple. Amongst such antibiotics is erythromycin and one of the tetracycline antibiotics. These will reduce the bacteria but will not affect the oil secretion from the sebaceous glands. Thus, the pimples may return, soon after you stop the treatment. Side effects too have been experienced as a consequence of usage of these medicines. So, even though it is a suggested remedy, it is better to stay away from these antibiotics. Read more on best over the counter acne treatment.

Last week I heard a rumor, from someone who knows about these things, that the 2009 Bordeaux was been predicted to be outstanding. Now at the time, I was mildly interested in this bit of news but did not think further than to make a mental note to myself to keep my eyes open and put down a few bottles.

Now, you can make your own kettle corn(recipe here), or you can just use a pre-made bag as did; this may be the easiest thing you have ever made. I prefer the Trader Joe's Kettle Corn because it is just lightly sweetened and you can still taste a hint of the salt.
After a considerable amount of head scratching with the boys at Sprocket Cycles in Digbeth, Birmingham (one of my favourite bike shops ever, by the way), we finally decided that, despite its age, this frame was actually built for 700c wheels, not the slightly larger 27″ ones I’d bought. Oh well, you live and learn, I guess.

For the other sentiment I chose another center from the "Nature Nested Sentiments" and a border from "Give Thanks Nested Frames", colored with Copics and handcut. I applied more Flowersoft to seperate the sentiment from the border. It is a mixture of Toffee Flowersoft and Sage Flowersoft - nice combination.

I didn’t have all that many Rockstar type clothes in my inventory, so it gave me an excellent excuse to go shopping. Again. I grabbed a really nice leather jacket with studs from Beetlebones and a sweet looking guitar necklace from NSD. But it didn’t feel quite complete without sunglasses. All rockstars wear sunglasses 24/7, everyone knows that. So these mesh glasses from Paris Metro Couture was the perfect finish.
‘But most of all the public needs to be told how NATO’s weapons of mass destruction are poisoning other countries around the world including this one. The U.S. has permanently contaminated the global atmosphere with radiation that has a half-life of two and a half billion years. Under the right conditions one alpha particle of uranium causes cancer. A pinhead of DU releases 12,000 alpha particles a second. I’ve seen a buried report that shows that uranium aerosols have been blown up here on wind currents from the war zone resulting in concentrations of uranium over Reading high enough to alert the Environment Agency, who decided that nobody needed to know.

In the northern county of Yorkshire, 10% of people of working age are now unemployed. The percentage of people out of work varies across the UK, but not vastly. Once the powerhouse of the entire UK, and by extension the British Empire, Yorkshire was transformed from a natural nation with a strong agrarian population, into an urban centre with vast wealth for the rulers, and abject poverty for the masses. Yesterday's Budget is but another step along a path to the annihilation of natural living and human dignity; it does nothing to lower unemployment, or to help those who are out of work in any part of the UK.
Life is full of mysteries, great and small. A small mystery for me has been why coffee made in a French press requires so much more coffee to achieve the same strength of brew compared to a drip coffee maker. It just seemed intuitive to me that if you take nearly boiling water, dump it straight into the ground coffee and let it steep, you have the maximum possible exposure to the surface area of the coffee and therefore you're going to get the strongest possible brew. But it just ain't so. In fact, you have to use almost twice as much coffee in the press. Hmmmmm.

Well, I’ve been home for over a week now. So far, I’ve settled in about 80% and probably won’t finish the other 20% for another couple weeks. My brother is home in between jobs and we are working on cleaning and organizing the entire house, which has furniture I get to use. SO, that being what needs to happen for me to finish, I know have a couple weeks till I am finally there. I can deal with that…easy.
Do you suffer from Allergy or congestion once spring comes around. Some think it is a reaction in the body. The heavier mucus the body accumulates during the Winter starts to melt within and we need to release this mucus. You can do this by increasing spring foods which happen to be light and easily digestible foods. Green vegetables happen to be among the first items to pop up in the garden for a reason. They help us to cut the mucus and detox.
Julia is powered by American taxpayer subsidies and thin-film photovoltaic solar cells (also funded by American taxpayers).

But Stanley K. Stowers, in his Rereading of Romans, spends a chapter discussing Greco-Roman culture and how it influenced Paul’s views of sexuality. This is especially important in light of Romans 1, arguably the prooftext exemplar for those who argue the sinfulness of homosexuality.

It had to be, because as a general rule Sam Adams beers are complete bullshit. Barely better than Coors, except with the claim that they're craft beers they actually fall far short of what we all know Coors to be. If Coors claimed to be craft, they'd be a bigger liar than Sam Adams, but they don't. So Sam Adams is the biggest liar in the beer world.

Everest Kitchen in Marrickville is a modest suburban restaurant committed to serving traditional Nepalese dishes. Multi-coloured prayer flags and lanterns hang over a crowd that includes Nepalese families and curious locals. A huge LCD screen has looping footage of life in the Himalayas but to be honest, it’s more distracting than atmospheric. Service can be a little slow at times so turn up expecting a leisurely meal.

I love tofu dishes and have long wanted to make salt and pepper from my Women's Weekly cookbook. So tonight I finally made it because my boss gave me all the ingredients! You see I work casual shifts at a Chinese restaurant but my boss left to China with her family today so she gave me all her left over ingredients. In fact, I am going to join her in China in a few weeks which I am very excited for. But back to this recipe...it is so flavourful and easy to make. I love the crunch of the deep-fried tofu and then the silk interior. Also, I actually cooked my vegetables but the recipe calls for uncooked vegetables to create a salad.
Unfortunately for poor little Ophelia, everyone else around her can’t say the same. Her king and queen use her to try to get to Hamlet. Her father sells her out to do the same. Hamlet uses her for a variety of things, including helping his own cause and toying with her obvious feelings for him.

Whether you’re gripped for the duration, though, largely depends on whether you’re the kind of person who’s engaged by the substance of what’s washing over you. Ideas is full of detail and tiny motions. The counterpoint to the twinkling melodies is often linear, like in “Silent Visitor.” In other places, like on “Brownian Motion,” the counterpoint feels more vertical. But what keeps you locked in to Ideas‘ slow trajectory is Dundov’s grasp of emotions. He simply makes you want to stay with the feeling.

PJ: “So many things! I think the 10th Birthday show we did in London will be the most memorable, seeing how dance music had changed forever as acts like Skrillex (who played his first European show that night) have been able to draw in a crowd who would typically only do guitar based gigs – quite a powerful experience!”
Kashmir is the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term Kashmir geographically denoted only the valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Today Kashmir denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir (the Kashmir valley, Jammu and Ladakh), the Pakistani-administered Gilgit-Baltistan and the Azad Kashmir provinces, and the Chinese-administered regions of Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract. www.rayphoto.in

Baby, ya need some friends. A little back-up, ya know? But being social and friendly doesn't actually come naturally to everyone, and even for those blessed with the friendshippy gene... it can be easy to let this stuff slip as we become adults and the weight of responsibilities start sitting on our shoulders, and maybe we rely more heavily on our spouse and kids for human interaction and less and less with other women. And hey! I am Mormon, biiig on families right? Big on BIG families and all that, so the more family time the better!?

They don't seem to mind their crates; in fact, they go right into them without any cajoling whatsoever. Nonetheless, this crating process can be a hassle. We have to empty the storage compartment to pull out the crates, and then empty everything out again to put the crates away. Also, Barley drops so much hair when he's in his crate that I have to vacuum when we return. Although he seems happy enough, I think this shedding is a sure sign that he does suffer from some crate anxiety.
Some of my books have pages that have been stained with tears and some have flowers pressed in the pages. There are some whose pages are brown and crackly around the edges. This is because they had the misfortune of being in the direct path of one of my many coffee spills. Sometimes I come across a book that has pages falling out of it or one that has lost it's cover. It doesn't matter. I love them despite their defects.
I arrived in Indianapolis on Thursday, the day before the festival. The hotel is within walking distance of five other hotels...and nothing else. Well, almost nothing else. I was given a room on the first floor which I didn’t think anything of because I did a quick walkthrough and discovered that it was far enough away from the majority of the action to not be a bother. So then I realize that I hadn’t eaten since a granola bar that morning so I order room service. No answer. Huh. Okay, so I go to the restaurant. No one’s there. Apparently, one needs to be a semaphore to get food in this joint. I go back to my room and try to call room service one more time. No dice.

As the excitement began to wrap up, we drove the girls back to Conway for the evening. It was a lovely day. Busy, as always, but still good. We filled every second of it with family, and that's about perfect.
We park the car, and find our way to the already-lengthening queue on Maxwell Street, it’s not raining at the moment but it is wet under foot, Brown was clever enough to have a couple of large umbrellas in the car which we take with us. It’s 2:30pm, the gates open in one hour.
He then follows this, almost perfunctorily, with a letter that explains the film's whole plot, because after a climax like that, there's not much to do but quickly wrap things up and call it a day. As Sir John reads this letter, the shadows of the circus crowd flit by on the wall behind him, giving the scene a weird, disconnected feeling, as though the hero has quietly tucked himself off in a corner, isolated from the chaos, to resolve the plot. It's fitting, too, that the film then ends with a curtain coming down on a theater's stage, a last playful touch that accentuates the artificiality of these dramatics.
How sad will their awakening be, when, with our out-numbering votes, we will turn them, for ever, from every position of honor, power and profit! What will those hypocritical and godless sons and daughters of the fanatical Pilgrim Fathers say, when not a single judge, not a single teacher, not a single policeman will be elected if he be not a devoted . . . Roman Catholic? What will those so-called giants think of their matchless shrewdness and ability, when not a single Senator or member of Congress will be chosen, if he be not submitted to our holy father the Pope? What a sad figure those Protestant Yankees will cut when we will not only elect the President, but fill and command the armies, man the navies, and hold the keys of the public treasury?

Denise pondered the conflict between she and her male subordinate, Rob. She weighed possible actions against imagined results. She wondered if the best thing wouldn’t be to just let it drop. But then again, the precedent would undermine her ability to supervise the rest of the employees. And Rob’s ego would permeate the whole company. Denise picked up the phone.
Two days ago, no, now it’s been three, I did the Cheyenne Mountain Trail Race 25k in Cheyenne Mountain State Park outside Colorado Springs. Nice race! Great organization, friendly folks and fantastic weather. And other than a little bit of off-stomach, I felt great, ran smart, and came in second in my age group (Female 50-99 – ha!). The woman who beat me, well, besides the fact that I never saw her, was a phenom and finished fourth or fifth out of the women overall.
So… I’ve always taken an interest in swearing and what may or may not be offensive.

It passed through various dynasties in India until the early 1500s, when it fell into the hands of the Moghul Empire. The Moghuls would hang on to the stone until 1739, when Persian conqueror Nadir Shah invaded. He defeated the Moghuls and raided their treasures (taking the Darya-ye Noor and the Noor-ol-Ain diamonds, both of which we’ve discussed before). There is a tale that the Moghul emperor tried to keep the Koh-i-Noor by hiding it in his turban. When Nadir Shah was tipped off about the deception, he invited the conquered emperor to a celebration. The catch? The celebration included a traditional trading of turbans, a gesture of friendship. The emperor had no choice but to hand over his turban. When he unwrapped the turban and the massive white diamond fell out, Nadir Shah was said to have exclaimed, “Koh I Noor!”, which means Mountain of Light – and thus our stone had a new name. (A name which you will see spelled many different ways, I should note.)
This barn was threatened and saved from demolition in 1989, with negotiations resulting in an easement agreement between the Cottage Grove Historical Society and the property owner. The easement expired in 2010 and extension negotiations with the new owner have been unsuccessful. The new owner has assessed a fee of $130,000 for the barn with a small portion of land, or $30,000 for the signage, the latter being the price he believes he can fetch on eBay.

Our plan of attack is to fill in the holes the dogs have already dug with concrete , then putting some form of visual barrier against the fence. Possibly barbed or razor wire along the top to make sure they can't jump over. We though about putting barbed wire along the bottom, but that would be a bad idea (as you can guess, with small dog breeds, that's a recipe for disaster.).

Dear Joey… I was really hopeful… I went to my interview at Wonderland… and was interviewed by a woman named Alice who offered me tea and cakes… but she never put any tea in my cup and took my cake away immediately after she gave it to me… when we were suddenly interrupted by some large woman named Queen wearing a leotard covered in hearts Shouting something about Fred or head and wanting it or getting it or losing it or something.. I could not follow at all… anyway.. It is march and I had hair.. but I have decided I better shave it off because of after that crazy event. .. they kept sharpening axes and everything there.. very, very strange.. but they gave me some consultation gift after telling me I was not quite mad enough and sent me off with a hat box and inside I found latter was a note saying this is now my personal looking-glass… or so they called it… looked like a jewelers loop to me… but OK whatever they want to call it. So unfortunately I did not get the job… but I did get propositioned by a tart when I was driving away….. and then she said not to even think about it and turned and drove away on her scooter chair… actually she was more like… well at 80 years old as I believe she was how great was that.. now my ego is bruised…

“I don’t know, I sense frustration in everybody, including myself,” Chaney said. “I had a hard time as a playcaller finding any rhythm in that game. Long fields early, the second half didn’t start the way we wanted, it was a difficult time. It doesn’t surprise me that some of our young players lost a little composure, as I did too at times. It was a tough deal. We move on from it, we learn from it.”

As we can see, the NDP garnered the highest share of positive responses, the Bloc Quebecois the highest share of negative responses, while voters were least ambivalent or subjective in their feelings on the Conservatives and especially the Liberals. What is interesting regarding the terms associated with the Bloc Quebecois is that the responses regarding them are from Quebec voters only. It would not be of much bother to the Bloc if non-Quebec voters held such a low regard for the party, yet the fact that their fellow Quebecois seem to express such a negative set of terms in relation to the party does not bode well for their party brand and any hope of a comeback.
To see how the MS-13 is merely an opportunistic fungus growing on a decaying, decadent national body, one might take a peek at Virginia.

I received the following email yesterday:
I laid in the middle of one of the quads last night with my friend, just watching the stars midst a beautiful cirrus sky. A common expression I say when I really don’t want to tell someone what I talked about with someone else is that “we talked about Life and Love and Why.” The silly part is that this is exactly what we talked about last night, and it made me want to clutch onto whatever is left of my pre-adult life as much as possible. I won’t be able to just lay in the middle of the soft May grass with a friend and talk about everything, especially doing this while tipsy. That’s public intoxication, and that’s a big no-no in the real world. These small moments make the incoming matriculation frightening.

But, Ehrenreich notes, “it is not enough, though, to cull the negative people from one’s immediate circle of contacts; information about the larger human world must be carefully censored.”

This outfit ended up being Miss T's Easter outfit. I made a very simple twirl skirt with two fabrics, appliqued a little flower onto an inexpensive shirt and then whipped up a headband.
“The Tree of Life” is the fifth feature film in the forty-year career of the reclusive director Terrence Malick. It received mixed reactions at the Cannes Film Festival in May this year. There were boos and applause. That it finally won the top prize at the festival, the prestigious Palme d’Or, indicates which side prevailed. But, it is a film that needs to be experienced personally before one takes side, and maybe seeing it more than once.
You may well feel that you're good at adapting but rarely do you think things though! You've got a goal in mind so stop making excuse and get on with it!
Seriously, why does it always look like it PAINS her to give him a compliment? Passive aggressive much? Did he steal her pudding cup back when they were Disney kids or something? I’m beginning to think SHE’S the one stuck on the whole Mouseketeer thing, because she won’t. Stop. Mentioning. It.

Today I had a pretty awful retail experience trying to buy some expensive electronics at JB Hifi. (Actually, I had no intention of spending money today in JB Hifi, since we had a bad experience with how they treated us when a DVD player broke last year, but they didn't know that I was only there to compare prices.)

Fiction and fantasy are certainly my things, usually the books I read are paranormal romance with vampires, werewolves or other supernatural happenings going on. Sci-fi also takes a strong lead and… any of that along with some erotica is a perfect blend. In any case, I like a read that takes me away, far away from reality. I get into the weird and the strange. Prophecy of the Guardian captivated me and held me like glue with its elements of magic, prowess, and even the darkness.
The characters were interesting. Kerrick is stubborn, but noble. Belen is the lovable “Poppa Bear” always looking out for his cubs. Flea, is the youngster who just wants to grow up, and don’t forget the inseparable Vinn and Quain. Each character has the niche, and getting to know them was part of the fun. Avery herself is a strong female character. She lets Kerrick know that she decides who she will and won’t heal. I love that despite being a captive, she has the strength of character to stand up for herself.
Finally, embellishments are added. Some gold braid for a skirt, a little blue tit & some fluffy feather in the hole, and a die-cut swallow on the ribbon. The finished birdhouses can be hung with pegs (don't hang near heat sources - card is flammable!).
Ronan went into Sundance’s room. Ash slept, curled in a ball with her long, brown hair fanned out on the pillow. Ronan bent down in front of her and brushed her hair back off her face. When had she gotten so beautiful? When had she grown up? He could not be more proud of her, but he ached with the loss of his little girl. He tried to ignore the dark heavy tattoos which covered her fair skin, but he could not, they were a part of her now.
Many of those that remain desperately want existence to continue. As the remaining races struggle to survive and fight over saving existence, lofty ideals give way to brutal pragmatism. Missions are sent out in search of the Seeker. One such mission encounters Kara an outcast noblewoman of the Labateen, a Stone-Age warrior culture. Kara is well versed in the Seeker’s litany, beyond what would be considered coincidence –to Kara the litany is simply the ways of God. Will Kara be able to help locate the Seeker?
I can’t really remember a time before Kathy. She and my brother dated before he went to Viet Nam, in ~67. They got married when he came home, around 70. I was 6 years old. When I was in elementary school I would spend long summer days with Kathy in their apartment. Some people thought I was their first child. After all our names were the same… same spelling… and surely I look genetically tied to my brother.

On the evening of Friday, May 4, prior to celebrating Great Vespers, Bishop-elect Alexander made his public acceptance of his election. In his address he stated that, “when standing before the holy altar at the anaphora, the bishop images forth the one and unique High Priest, Christ, Who acts through His celebrant.” He then added that, “while it is true that our Lord Jesus is true God and true King, it is also true that He did not come to us, His creatures, with the pomp and splendor of the King, attended by the legions of heaven, but rather in humility He emptied Himself and was found in the likeness of a servant.”
I’ve limited this discussion to shows I can actually recall watching within this 2-year period in the early 1970s. My parents loved California when we lived there, I have childhood pictures where I’m wearing a leather vest with fringes on it, my preschool teacher had hair down to her backside and I can distinctly recall flower children, hippies and giant afros, going to picnics in beautiful places in forests and my first days and years in school. Mix all of that together – taken alongside even earlier strange happenings and memories at Hamilton AFB in Nevado, California – and you have neurons firing in a manner that creates a neural net of a certain type.
John was later arrested though at a phone booth on the Champs Elysees in Paris when he was answering a call from someone who had been working for Claude Duboc. The arrest was arranged by the US Justice Department who requested that Interpol pick him up and hold him in France until he could be extradited to the US.

I love the thought of painting an interior door. Either to match the room/hallway outside or the room inside, I think this could be really stunning. I also love the little peek of red/orange on the side of the door.
WITWER: Yeah because, for the first time in the series, we do an episode where it’s not just a few scenes with the three of us. All three of us are there together, the entire episode, dealing with the same thing, which is really great. Our favorite stuff to shoot is when we’re all together.
It's another Designed 2 Delight Design Team Challenge - where does all that time go? To be fair, my mojo is missing so this is going to be a Card Redo. What's a card Redo? Well I'm switching out the papers and colors of an old sketch and redoing an older card. My mojo tends to leave me when I'm being pulled in about six different directions. So, to spare myself the misery of trying to come up with something new, I rework something I know I like; it saves me time - which is KEY for me right now.
ounger Brothers The Younger brothers were an important portion of the James-Younger Gang of the mid-west during the 1800's. They came from a family with fourteen children, though only four of the brothers - Cole, Jim, Bob and John - were involved in the gang. Their father, Henry Younger, was a good man, a prosperous land owner and, despite having slaves, a Union supporter who felt slavery should be abolished (I know...I'm confused, too).
This was before phones had cameras. The SX-70 was small for the time but still the size of a hardback book. The film cost something like 6 or more dollars in 1979 money for ten prints. And he had to store these photos – even one photo each day added up.
9) Decked out in green wallpaper and odd knickknacks, "an atmosphere of perpetual Christmas," the house would prove a place of great inspiration for Capote. He wrote part of 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' here. Perhaps more notably, it was here that he picked up a New York Times are read about the brutal slaying of a Kansas family. Capote set about working on what became 'In Cold Blood' the next day.
“On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.”

Anyway, this is a little excerpt from a bunch of word dumping I did around 1995. I would have been 21 or 22 then. I was working on my philosophy master's degree then and living in Oxford, MS, and the evidence of this drips from every slip of paper in the folder. Overwrought expositions on the nature of Being, written up as fiction? Check. Dallying with every southern litfic stereotype written? Check.

I recently finished a book that I have said to many...has been "life changing." I am NOT going to give the name of the book or the author's name, merely because I have not been led to write this blog to sell a book. God has been spurring me on for a couple of days now and the more I procrastinate, the louder He speaks to my heart.

There was a little bit of spousal involvement (Honey? You are always welcome to take the car I'm going to take to work the next day if you pay attention to how much gas is left in it when you get home, m'kay?) but I can't kick too much - he's the one who came and rescued me.
I did several things to the card - I colored the background with ink and a rolled over some screen material. I then ran it through my Wizard with a cuttle bug folder (leaves). Then I ran the arch type die (side dies) (floral borders) through my Wizard and punched out the pieces and placed them on the background paper about 1/2 inch in on both sides. I then used a HIT (Hearts in Touch) stamp to stamp the flowers atop and placed them over the arch dies. I then stamped a couple (from a miscellaneous stamp company), cut them out, and then placed them on the background being sure to place them so they looker further back. The roses were colored an off white with my DerWent water color pencils and there were some daisies that I colored yellow with a brown center, also with my water color pencils.
I also miss doing things that make me happy. Does blogging and reading blogs or crafting make you happy? It does for me. Unfortunately, I'm finding it difficult to be able to do any of those. I will not be giving up or giving in.. I refuse. What is life worth if you cannot enjoy the people and the pleasures you love? We only live once and life is short. It is a simple concept of balance. I need to find my balance between school and the rest of my life.
I'll never, ever, EVER pass for a soccer mom. But . . . I suppose on the outside of things, my household might appear somewhat normal. You know, for a family with four kids (one moved out), two grandparents living with us, two dogs, a cat, a hedgehog, a ball python . . . and one mom who writes. There is the piano, the tuba, the violin (noise). One Naked Pirate Boy practicing Tae Kwon Do moves. (More noise.) And a LOT of clutter everywhere. Just too many of us in one house.

Not shockingly, New Belgium Brewing leads us into the top 3 craft beer producers in 2011. Whether or not you like their year-round offerings, you have to admit that New Belgium has an impressive lineup of sours, and their Lips of Faith series is constantly experimenting and pushing new things onto the market. While not all of them are necessarily successful, some are excellent beers. I'll drink Cocoa Mole like there's no tomorrow. And of course, we have to give them props locally for hooking up with Chef Tio at Julian to blend an exclusive sour beer.
Since America has been America it has faced challenges as it relates to racial tension that has divided blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, and nearly all non-whites. Is it getting better? I would say no and I would use the current case of Trayvon Martin as an example of the disparity of justice as an example. It has been so bad so long, with respect to racial profiling, it’s hard to see the difference, particularly in many African American communities. Let me add this is not unlike what happens in many African American communities.

Originally from Afghanistan he was exiled to France and wrote his novel,The Patience Stone, in French. Atiq told us that writing in French was very liberating. "Language is like a skin.

Atiq's novel challenges the taboos around women in Afghani society He is not readily accepted into the Afghani exiled community in Paris, let alone in his home country.

Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found not only the hair dryer, but also some other treats to help my hair stay healthy and shiny. This has to be the prettiest box I have ever received in the mail! You can really tell that the folks at Misikko care about their products and about customer service. This blow dryer was amazing. The thing I noticed right away was the temperature. This dryer never got to hot. (Something that really matters with my thin hair!) Typically, with my cheaper hair dryer I couldn't keep it in one spot of my head for too long or it would burn my scalp. This dryer however was warm, but never hot. I was able to use my round brush and comb, and spend my time really working my hair dry, instead of hurrying the drying process for fear of the heat. Even with the cooler temperature, my hair dried in half the time it normally takes, and it was immediately smooth and shiny( without the help of any added products!) . I didn't even have to use my straightener to style afterwords, because the dryer had done it all for me! This Hana blow dryer is on the higher side of the pricing scale, but spending the money now means you'll have healthier, happier hair for longer. By the end of my first use, this dryer became my favorite tool in my cabinet.
When historians look back on the first decades of the 21st century, he writes, they may conclude that the political and economic crisis that swept over the world was the direct result of decades of resource misallocation driven by political objectives. They will look back on the drilling bans, environmental edicts which have shut down agricultural areas, the massive entitlement expansions and quests for carbon sequestration and ask: what were the political leadership thinking?

The WordPress statistics show that very few people come to this blog from Twitter, so perhaps I’m wasting my time posting announcements of these posts on Twitter. And almost nobody bothers to retweet them. I quite often go to other people’s blog posts when I see them on Twitter, though I tend to ignore tweets without links, mainly because they lack context, and it is rare that anything meaningful (other than “Will be late for dinner tonight”) can be fitted into 140 characters. And that brings me to the last tool which is

Given at the dawn of creation, these words, known as the Protoevangelium (“First Gospel”), foretell how the woman one day will have a seed, a son, who will crush the head of the serpent (Catechism of the Catholic Church, no. 410). Centuries later, at the wedding feast of Cana, this prophecy begins to be fulfilled. By calling Mary “woman” with the creation story in the background, Jesus in the narrative of John’s Gospel is not merely addressing her politely as He does Mary Magdalene or the Samaritan woman. Rather, He is identifying Mary as the woman of Genesis 3:15.
Moreover, a document prepared by the FBI’s Special-Agent-in-Charge at its Albuquerque, New Mexico office on June 22, 1950, titled Bacteriological Warfare – Espionage-Sabotage (Bubonic Plague), refers to rumors then flying around the official world that an outbreak of bubonic plague in New Mexico’s rat population may have been the result of deliberate, bacteriological warfare-related activities by – once again - hostile, unknown forces.

Not only popular with the people, Bican also mixed with the rich and famous of Prague society. However, in 1950 when in danger of losing his Prague apartment to a Communist Party official, he decided to leave Slavia (historically a middle-class club) for the steelworks team, Železárny Vítkovice, to try to improve his standing with the Communist authorities.

Publishers' closures can be a nightmare for authors. While some do the right thing by their writers, formally releasing rights before shutting down (here's one that did this), the more unprofessional or unscrupulous companies may simply vanish, yanking their websites, terminating their email addresses, refusing to respond to letters and phone calls (here's one that did that). Even if a publisher no longer exists, having your rights encumbered by a still-existing, unterminated contract may make it extremely difficult to interest a new publisher in your book. Writer Beware has gotten hundreds of complaints over the years from writers left in this kind of limbo by collapsing small publishers and micropresses.
Gehry asked Decker, "How would you do it, ideally?"

But the process has only just begun. The new GTP-transducin-rhodopsin complex can now very quickly bind to another protein resident in the cell called “phosphodiesterase.” This enables the phosphodiesterase protein to cut yet another molecule resident in the cell, called cGMP. Since this process takes place in the millions of proteins in the cell, the cGMP concentration is suddenly decreased.

“Baptism for the dead is a powerful evidence that Joseph Smith was a real prophet and the Church of Jesus Christ has been restored. The LDS practice has long been derided as absolute fiction and an abomination, and based on a terrible mis-interpretation of 1 Cor.15:29. However, long after Joseph Smith restored the practice through revelation, dozens of ancient documents have turned up showing that early Christians (at least some) indeed believed in and practiced baptism for the dead much as we do today. “

Reading my story to the family was so much fun. I love reading out loud to people and making them laugh. The format in our writing group though, is to pass around printed copies of our work for people to look at and give feedback on. I like this style too and by doing it this way we are able to get through more works than we would if we let everyone read out loud. BUT just this got me to wondering - how many people out there LIKE sharing their work - actually enjoy the drama and emotions of being able to put your own voice with your words. To have the ability to TELL the story to others the way you wrote it? How many of you absolutely hate it and would rather have your nails pulled out by the roots than have to speak to the public? How many of you have a hard time sharing your work at all? I do this for fun and am very good at taking criticism so it doesn't really bother me at all. I do my best to learn from my mistakes and become a better writer from it. I am not depending on my writing for a sole source of income. I can see where it would be hard for others though.
A duet at the end of the work assumed a classical ballet structure, presenting male and female soloists independently and then as a duet. The male soloist’s choreography introduced quaking in the upper body, finger articulation and narrative gestures, while the female dancer, after performing an out-of-place leg hold turn, repeated earlier movement themes. The duet and the work came to a close as the male dancer abandoned the female dancer onstage.

And the element that made this episode really great: Beckett relating to Kyle. He feels used, he’s going to need some time to accept what happened and get over it. There was a really great scene after she interrogates him for the first time and he says he doesn’t remember anything. Castle steps in and says that people who go through traumatic things always remember, to which Beckett answers that he might need time accepting things. Best of all, at the end of the episode, they completely acknowledge the fact that they are using him as an expy for Beckett, and she says she’s been having therapy, it’s helping, and she’s almost right where she wants to be emotionally. Like the end of the last episode, this leaves me a lot of hope wiggle room.
2. Ignorance causes alienation. . ..” being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them” (Eph. 4:18).
Where have two years gone? As I look back into the past, I remember that two years ago tonight, I was spending my last night with my baby boy tucked safely away in my belly. I had a picture in my mind then of how his birth and brief life would be. I had a picture of how our time would be spent loving on him. For twelve weeks we tried our best to figure out how we would meet Eli and hand him back into the Lords arms. That is something no parent should ever have to contemplate, but it was what we were left doing. We spent the better part of twelve weeks with a starving hunger to get to know Eli. I had a picture in my mind of what he looked like, what color his eyes were, what his tiny little cry would sound like. I would day dream about how beautiful and perfect he was going to be. We had no idea what to expect but I had my pictures...my dreams.
Homeschool Questions/Thoughts I Have: I have been thinking a lot lately on how to add a little spice to our school days. I really enjoy the days that we take time away from the books and do special crafts or learning units on a particular subject. I also enjoy watching the girls work together as a team. This does not happen very often, but when it does it is a wonderful sight to see.

My mom used to make this really bland baked chicken. She would bake a whole chicken with some veggies and stuff. My brother and I didn't like it, so we barely ate any. The good part of that was that the next night, mom would always make chicken enchiladas with the left over chicken. The enchiladas were awesome. My brother and I never told mom we hated the chicken, so she kept making it. As a matter of fact, when mom announced that dinner was baked chicken, Wes and I would usually get excited. For years, mom never understood why we got so excited over the baked chicken, but barely touched it. We told her when we were both in our 30s. Come to find out, mom would have happily skipped the baked chicken night and just made us some enchiladas.
I think I’ve heard CHLY’s Dave O Rama play this guy before – I might have heard him mention the label Bonsaiety Records. (But there’s so much good music on that little community radio station, it’s easy to forget)

The cost of making you righteous is very great. Jesus loves you so much that he decided to pay the price for you. Because if Him you can be a good person if you believe and repent. Don’t take his love or gift for granted.
This cultural reality makes it very difficult to speak of authentic Christian experience – for we speak to one another as addicts. We largely know experience as an alcoholic knows alcohol. That an alcoholic might prefer vodka to wine tells me nothing about vodka or wine. Religious experience tells me almost nothing about God, the Church, truth, etc. It is God, the Church, truth, etc., viewed through the fog of distorted modern perception.

Indeed, I do not know if any of the so-called “Holocaust-deniers” actually, ever, umm, y’know … deny the Holocaust. They question certain aspects of the Holocaust history that’s been handed down to us, but they don’t explicitly say that what we know as the Holocaust never took place. (Yes, I’m sure you can find at least one nut-case somewhere.)
What a great challenge, though, for me to veganize! I love being able to show that I can make a very similar and delicious dish that is much healthier and more importantly, compassionate. The plan seemed simple: leave the cow alone and use seitan for the steak, swap out the butter for vegan butter and the fries would be oven-baked.

As a nation, we face a risk that in two years time, we will be unable to get anyone to lend us money to fund what will still be an ongoing gap between tax receipts and what we pay in social welfare and public sector costs. That risk has been recently dismissed as “ludicrous” by our Minister for Finance, but many doubt what he says, and believe that Minister Noonan is merely trying to build confidence and hope.
CCSVI is a condition marked by limited blood flow from the major veins that drain the central nervous system. The reduced blood flow from the brain and spinal cord is caused by collapsed or blocked veins and is treated by venous angioplasty. Although the connection between CCSVI and MS is not yet fully understood, the results experienced by MS sufferers who have received this treatment are remarkable.

My Grandmother lived to the age of 90 and then died suddenly on Christmas Day, after spending the night dancing on Christmas Eve. My father recently showed me a family treasure that I did not know existed – a Five-Year Diary that she kept from 1939 to 1944, which she started at the age of 26.
On the way home, I reflected on the day. How was it possible that on the one day I was supposed to be dedicating all my appreciation and thanks towards the group of people that is likely the least privileged in Ghana, could I have felt so privileged? I was absolutely undeservedly given privileged treatment all day. It blew my mind. Why? Because I’m foreign? Because I’m seen as a guest? Because of my skin colour? Because I work at the Regional Office? Because I work for an NGO? Do I inadvertently ask for privilege or special treatment through my actions or words? How can I be more aware? What privilege do I receive that I don’t even know about? I don’t have answers to any of these questions, but I can’t help but be angry at a system that gives or allows such a disparity in opportunity and privilege: on Farmer’s Day, the best farmers in the region, for their career of unbelievable manual labour and effort, received a bicycle, rubber boots and some rain pants and I, a young, inexperienced nobody, was given the seat of the Regional Minister and travelled in high style.

Anyway, what I expect from the next chapter would be the return of the battle between the Uchiha brothers and Kabuto. I’m tired of Kabuto’s past. The ‘gentle’ moments from his past is over, and seeing this chapter shows that his path has led towards the direction that it is now at. Other than that, I think that’s what all the chapter will be for next time.

Become our sons as well.His constant refrain was that nations are people in the land and that the strength of nations depends upon the strength of its people; in a speech in Ankara in 1920 he said:
When God leads us into difficult places that seem to us like the far side of the desert, he is drawing us aside to reveal exclusively to us something of his nature. Our response in the desert should not be to run away but to draw close to the flame of God’s presence , to hear his voice and respond to Him.

Some Divine names in the indefinite form, like ‘Raoof’ or ‘Raheem’ are permissible names for men as Allah has used them for Prophets; but ‘Ar-Raoof’ (the Most Pious) and Ar-Raheem (the most Merciful) can only be used if prefixed by ‘Abd’ meaning ‘slave of’ or ‘servant of’ i.e. ’Abdur-Raoof’ or ‘Abdur-Raheem’. Similarly ‘Abdur-Rasool’ (slave of the Messenger) or ‘Abdun-Nabee’ (slave of the Prophet) are forbidden. (Naik, Concept of God; underline emphasis ours)

Story wise we have some interesting themes that come up, the relationship between fathers and sons, and mortals and gods. It’s a shame the movie script wants to really do the bare minimum, but honestly expecting anything great from the movie is going to lead to disappointment. It knows what it wants to be, and the story can go to hell as long as the visuals please the audience. Funnily in such a hollow script, the movie does have pacing issues, and it does seem to drag, which is amazing considering its only 99 minutes. Yet again the term, still it’s better than the remake, comes to mind but that’s not a ringing endorsement.
“You are what you eat.” In his new book, Stanley Park, up and coming Vancouver writer Timothy Taylor rescues this rather tattered axiom from high school health class, and endless motherly lectures, and places it squarely at the spiritual centre of:

He talks about nations versus empires. "Empires consist of peoples of different religions, languages, cultures, races and nationalities," he said. "Nations are dominated by one group that makes up a majority of the population. Nations are inherently stable while empires are always unstable."
But even if we forget Geraldo’s stereotypical comments, a more important question remains: why is the shooter not in custody yet? George Zimmerman, the shooter in the Trayvon Martin case, is protected under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law, which permits citizens to use deadly force in self-defense if there is a reasonable threat. Florida is one of 29 states that have adopted variations of this law, and depending on variation citizens are allowed to defend themselves in public areas without an obligation to retreat.

Cut to a few weeks later. It was March 31st and Daniel and I were watching a Jazz game in my basement. It was halftime, so we went to grab some snacks. On our way to the store I decided to probe Daniel to see where he was in the process of acquiring my ring. When I asked Daniel if he had picked up the ring, he told me it wasn't ready yet. My heart sank a little bit, so I asked him if he'd at least talked to my dad yet. No such luck. I was a little disappointed at the slow process, but I decided it wasn't that big of a deal. I gave up the conversation as we pulled in front of my house.
Sometimes I am daunted by all that I need or want to do. Sometimes I miss Brian so much it aches in my throat. Sometimes I just want to sit on the couch with a good book and pretend that all my projects are already finished. Like Monday, when I tilled the entire garden, TWICE. Then Tuesday after an entire morning of running here and there. I needed to buy all the veggie plants and seeds for the garden, a part for the weed eater (got the wrong one), and a dryer. Came home, ate lunch, put together Kate's new wheelbarrow, so she can help mommy.

This is why so many college students and casual media consumers have such a skewed view of the Middle East. Palestinian Arab crimes are minimized, but perceived Israeli violations of human rights are amplified, because the environment in Israel is so much more tolerant towards reporting anti-Israel news and Israel is filled with international reporters and NGOs eagerly filling their quotas of anti-Israel "research."

What we should be known for, what should characterize our lives as followers of Jesus? Love. A love which bears all things to the end. As we seek to follow the one who lived out this love, and continues to do so in and through us, by the Spirit. For and with each other in Jesus in mission to and for the world.

Your womb returns to normal (or a semblance of it) but your heart? It never goes back. It never recovers. It was meant to be enlarged.
Because what’s interesting is that for all of its faults, Timelash pulls off a bleakly clever bit of thematic unity here. Just as the Doctor’s past becomes a meaningless thing that is referenced vaguely and for its own sake HG Wells is separated from almost all actual representation of his history. The list of historical howlers about Wells is huge - his accent is wrong, his hair color is wrong, he goes by Herbert instead of George, he’s inexplicably well off, he appears to believe in God...

Anyway, when I got to the end I realized I had to change my hero's name. Well, I must be honest, it wasn't me being clever, it was Julie Cohen nudging me to consider my mistake. So there I was on page 1 of my manuscript summoning the Search & Replace window to change the name. However, I've suffered many disasters in the past with the S&R -forgetting to activate the Whole Word and Match Case options may prove catastrophic- and my hand began to tremble as the cursor hovered over Replace All so I decided to go for the safe alternative, i.e. replace them one by one.
I’m going to give the Browns entire draft, at the moment, a C++. If The Walrus gets over his bromance with Seneca Wallace, who’s apparently a dick and refused to help Colt transition last year (unless he was honest and told Colt, “Dude, I have no idea what I’m doing either.

News flash: RUNNING ISN’T CUTE. And if you’re doing it properly, you should NEVER look cute while doing it. You shouldn’t be smiling and waving at cameras. You shouldn’t be wearing make up. You should be running til it hurts to stand and looking like you’re about to puke. You should take pride in THAT. (I haven’t accomplished much of anything in these miserable years I’ve graced the planet with my equally miserable existence, but at the very least I can say I have crossed a finish line, staggered two feet then puked. And I take pride in that.)
I woke up Sunday, the same as I have for the last 3 months, and felt the call back to my bed instead of singing a song of worship in my head as I laced up my shoes like I had all the many months before. I was not sure that I would have an impact or that by going to church I would even be any good to anyone. I hadn’t slept much, and I looked like a mess when I went in the building. I went in to the sanctuary to hear our Worship team doing what they do best*, and our worship Pastor killing it as always. As I settled into my chair as we were told that we could be seated, I started to hear a spectacular sermon that I really needed to hear. I looked at my iPhone in my notes section where I house my Blog notes and jot stuff down, and I was surprised to see that I had not only one, but two of the main ideas that our sermon covered written down as possible ideas for blogs in the future. I was also blown away to see that we had even used the same wording on a few things. That was good enough for me. It was time to do what I needed to do, and get some time to put pen to paper.** The sermon consisted of being smarter with our money. Now, we were not hearing a sermon on managing money, and shoveling our cash towards the church to fund anything. There was no extra collection time where we took up dues and fees. We were not chastised for the fickle way that we skip the donation plates or that we fail to follow up to God’s wishes with our giving. That all could have been a fair topic given the day and time that we live in and the country in which we reside, but instead we did what we should have done in church and we stayed firmly in scripture. And let me tell you, if you think that Jesus of The Bible didn’t speak at great length about money and what we do with it, then you need to brush up on the book and the man again. I never even knew that there was as much discussion about it as there was. But I was happy to see our Pastor attack it so vigorously. I started to take notes from my head, and combine them with what he was saying and I started to get an outline for what is to follow. So, indulge me if you will, and listen to what my mash up of ideas along with key parts of his sermon produced. Hopefully it sounds as good on paper as it did in my head, but we will let God help me get that all working and fine-tuned.

I don't think most people in the states comprehended that the earthquakes never stopped. And with the constant reminders, it's hard to get the fear out of your head and heart. I never felt completely at ease until I left Japan. Which was a sad way to leave a place we all loved so much.
It was a good session. We learned about the "proper" way to address "complaints or criticisms". As long as we remember the rules and the procedures, we should be fine :) I think we need a little cheat sheet to keep with us at all times - ROFL!
The commission, of course, is in the propaganda game, indulging in damage limitation, which is why so much pressure was brought to bear. But in this case (as always) we had the evidence (see links on the blog) for the commission's failure, in the form of a series of studies published over the past eight years by Vassalos – arguably Europe’s leading expert on ship safety.

2. Fundamentally, I think the only preparation necessary is desire. There is a lot of catechesis that is wonderful and helpful, that should be done given the opportunity. But bread and wine are simple foods, basic, found on common tables all around the world. They are accessible, and so should the sacrament be. If someone walks up with no knowledge or understanding, but wants to receive Christ in the sacrament of Body and Blood, who are we to not “let” them? We are not going to diminish or desanctify the Body of Christ by allowing an unbaptized or uninitiated person take part; we may well do a disservice to the Body of Christ and to that person by turning them away. If we believe in God’s presence and power in the Eucharist, we should be eager to share that with any and every person we can.
Then I realized that it's for the best that I'm not watching while I'm here in New York. Instead, I had my parents DVR the entire week's worth of shows in HD so I can watch them on the huge plasma screen when I go home next week!

That I manage to regularly frustrate, inter alia, the Government’s Peace Secretariat as evinced by their assertion earlier this year that I “provide solace and relief to terrorists” is a good thing keeping in mind the nature of the Rajapakse regime, which is largely and viciously intolerant of competing narratives on war, peace, human rights and governance in Sri Lanka.

I read this definition of submission: "One equal, voluntarily placing himself under another equal, that God may be glorified." That really puts things into perspective! When I choose to submit to those over me, I bring glory to God with my life. We all have a choice to make.

Date a girl who doesn’t read because the girl who reads knows the importance of plot. She can trace out the demarcations of a prologue and the sharp ridges of a climax. She feels them in her skin. The girl who reads will be patient with an intermission and expedite a denouement. But of all things, the girl who reads knows most the ineluctable significance of an end. She is comfortable with them. She has bid farewell to a thousand heroes with only a twinge of sadness.

The grounds were swarmed with people and held a plethora of events and activities celebrating racing and cars in general. Old race cars as well as other beautiful models lined the paths and it was neat to see cars from all around the world including some classic American muscle cars. I felt like I had stepped foot in a new Fast & Furious movie. We finally found our spot on a slight hill in between turns 10 and 11 which had a perfect view of a straightway. As the clock ticked down, we admired the fighter jets performing their aerial show and took bets( being poor exchange students, they were more hypothetical bets than anything) on who was going to win. My friend, Ann is F1 obsessed and she was proudly adorned in her Jenson Button t-shirt while she taunted me that Vettel and Webber were going down.

In such an eventuality, no particularly careful analysis of the process of de-Islamization would be necessary. Indeed, the main problem would be determining how to restrict the measures brought to bear on Muslims to the minimum necessary, rather than allowing a resentful population to create great suffering for millions. However, though political parties explicitly opposed to the Islamic penetration of their countries have started to become more visible presences on their respective domestic political scenes, it is hard to predict a rapid change in attitudes towards Islam on the part of major political parties and thousands of influential people in the media and academia. The sheer magnitude of the intellectual and emotional investment in their current stance vis-à-vis Islam prohibits it.

Treat your customers well and they will come back; treat them like they are really special and they will not only come back more often but also spend more money.

My automatic pro-Israeli thinking, of course, has lessened. Bulldozing the houses of terrorists’ families and taking ten eyes for an eye if you are attacked smacks of the Nazis in their occupied territories in the 1940s and makes me think Have the Israeli government never read their own history books? It was counter-productive for the Germans. It is counterproductive for the Israelis. When they bulldoze a house, does the name Lidice never spring into their minds?
Tampering with Medicare this year, a huge distraction from the task of encouraging job growth, was possibly the dumbest thing the White House and Democrat Congress could have done. There will be a senior citizen payback at the ballot box in November.
Brittany Ellis -- rich and spoiled, right? But her outward perfection is a desperate attempt to make everyone believe she is a perfect daughter, perfect student, perfect friend because at home things aren't perfect. She creates a fake life of outward appearances, trusting no one; but she still has truths she holds onto. Brittany loves her sister, who has cerebral palsy, and will do anything to help her sister. Brittany has the strength to know her own heart and mind. Since Perfect Chemistry is told in alternating chapters, first Alex, then Brittany, we see how others see her, and her truth. And yes -- she can be bitchy. And dishonest. But she also is committed to her sister and her family.

Once one has out of the way the embarrassing disco-dancing, neither attentive nor revealingly contradictory to the score, the third act continues to heighten the contrast between the late bourgeois-phenomenal world and a noumenal alternative; we also continue to follow a stronger portrayal of Erik than is generally encountered. He emerges as more dignified, more of a credible character, despite his backward-looking music. Though Erik may be no revolutionary, here and in the preceding act – especially upon the words ‘Satan hat dich umgarnt!’ – he presents us not only with a plausible alternative morality to either of the production’s two principal worlds, but also with true, deeply-felt anger, through Marco Jentzsch’s finely judged, not-quite-heroic portrayal. He may be romantic rather than Romantic, but he is no cipher. However, it is the darkly Romantic image of Senta’s portrait that is revealed as the final backdrop for Martin Zehetgruber’s set designs. Victory for erotic metaphysics over Erik’s more plausible humanity? Perhaps, but not quite, for, in a move that genuinely shocked me, Erik shoots dead first the Dutchman, upon his self-revelation, and, following her final words, Senta too. Then comes the ‘redemptive’ ending, where one might have expected Dresden. Viewing the two lovers upon a now-empty stage, one continues to question, though not necessarily to discount, the claims Wagner makes for redemption. His music may point us to Tristan, but that only begs further questions.
The true title to this post should be “MJ Misses the Boat…And the Dock…”. Just last week I scolded Holly because while playing dolls, her storyline took a sinister twist: “Doll A took photos of Doll B in the shower and was blackmailing her”. It didn’t occur to me I should have stopped to take photos for an art exhibit ! Wait, I can go further than that…Many moons ago, while my friends and I took our Barbies through the treacherous terrain of our parent’s gardens, we had to be ever vigilant and guarded against sneak attacks from the neighborhood boys G.I Joe’s. They once captured my Barbie camper for a full week before we were able to A-Team our way into finding it and getting it back. Who knows what Barbie and her gal pals were subjected to at the hands of that “Kung Foo Grip” ! And in my early teens, not quite yet willing to part with my three-story Pepto-pink dream house (with elevator!), Barbie threw all kinds of parties and nonsense. Not once did any of us think to capture any of it on film. Blah.
There's also some classic British Film Noir: THE GAMBLER AND THE LADY, THE HOUSE, 36 HOURS, WINGS OF DANGER and THE GLASS CAGE.
It’s not hard to figure out how one of the most powerful human abilities became nearly synonymous with that universal act of sex and reproduction. There is a kind of magic there, of making something new, of giving life and new voice existence, and for many lucky species on this planet….connection. Euphoria, empowerment (along with some fear and hurt, yes), passion, intensity and love… The creative act is an act of connection, be it with a higher power or with one’s own true self.

This ain’t Pyrrus. The gravity isn’t twice Earth normal. All the flora and fauna isn’t dedicated to the notion that it should kill me as quickly as possible, and I don’t have to be in peak physical condition at all times to just have a *chance* to survive each day.

Structurally, the higher education sector looks a lot like the health care sector. It hasn’t seen the productivity gains enjoyed by sectors like manufacturing and retail, which have benefited extensively from automation and technological advances. Colleges still need to employ a lot of highly skilled workers, and college costs are tied to their wages, which rise faster than inflation. It’s no surprise, then, that the higher education inflation trend looks a lot like the alarming one we see in health care.
The arrests began, not coincidentally, at the same moment that Mali’s transitional prime minister was named. Dr. Cheick Modibo Diarra (CMD) is a political outsider but a familiar name here: a physicist by training, he gained fame working on NASA’s Mars Pathfinder mission in the 1990s, then headed Microsoft’s operations in Africa before becoming a candidate for the presidential elections that had been expected later this month. He is now officially in charge of forming a cabinet, organizing elections and reunifying his secession-split country — not necessarily in that order.

There are several other examples that the Institute cites, and I’ll address some of them here just to show how they 1) show ignorance of the person making the claim, and 2) how are completely irrelevant to the topic of the “evolutionary timeline.” Further reading of ICR claims on the subject will show any informed person how the Institute takes certain scientific discoveries and takes them out of context to try to refute Evolutionary theory.

I used the Pink Paislee London Market collection and I absolutely adore this collection! My brother lives in London and so was very apt for me to use this collection for this layout. I did some splash/blob painting on the background cardstock in silver, which actually came out quite nicely and sort of pulls the layout together. I also did the journalling around my photo, which I thought was a nice touch too.

I had decided – or should I say, the department had discussed the matter and agreed – that lessons were best ended with a five-minute activity to practise any relevant vocabulary, phrases or grammatical structures the pupils had learnt. Well that’s a moot point, for starters – when it came to my French lessons, they were prone to learning bugger-all. So playing language games at five-minutes-to-bell was high risk at best and professional suicide at worst. Departmental policy had, however, been set and I was going to live (and possibly die) by it.

There was a significant national response to the shootings: hundreds of universities, colleges, and high schools closed throughout the United States due to a student strike of four million students, and the event further affected the public opinion—at an already socially contentious time—over the role of the United States in the Vietnam War.

The PALS 1 program is designed for Peers with Advanced Leadership Skills who are coming back a second or third year to really focus on specific leadership skills. The program has changed somewhat over the years, but the main focus has always been to help those teens who are in positions of leadership be more effective leaders and to train to be leaders at ITI. (The PALS 2 program has been renamed Youth Staff and is just that: teens who have been through the program and are ready to practice what they’ve learned. They work with a volunteer staff member in leading discussion groups, working with action teams, and making sure the participants feel welcome and have a great week.)

It's the first time (Apart from my beloved) that I'd met anyone i've encountered in the artificial world of the internet. And I'm so glad I did. I felt as though I'd known them for ages, and was amongst friends, which seems strange, based on this medium of the blogworld, yet for whatever reason, it's true.

Tonight was such an awesome night. My dad in law played music with some awesome musicians for a night of worship concert. It was amazing! I have not felt so touched and close to God in a long time. No books. No preaching at me. No one telling me what to do. No one telling me what to say or where to go. Just me+music+God and it was awesome! Now dont you all go thinking im turning into a holy roller on ya-- Im just trying to get myself together. Im still exactly the same person, just a different attitude and a different mindset thats all.

A perfectly manicured hand is one where the nails are strong and smooth, with no discoloration, jagged cuticles or other signs of abuse. But what about nails that are less than perfect? Since many health problems have an impact on the nails, it’s worth listening to what your hands have to say.
After years of rising before dawn, in all seasons and weather, to carefully photograph the positions of the sun, Mr. Freeman found the rocks once thought to be simply strewn across the prairie instead mark the progression of the year with uncanny accuracy.

One of the problems with Norway is that all the important positions are filled by individuals who have the ‘correct’ political opinions and are willing to follow the ‘directions’ set forth by the authorities, and not by individuals who have the best qualifications and who would carry out their responsibilities in a far superior manner.
Forever ago (in the beginning of December), I was contacted by Vanessa, a representative for GoGo squeeZ, an applesauce in a pouch snack marketed for kids. Vanessa asked if the monsters and I would be willing to try her product and maybe write what we thought about it here on the blog. I'll admit that I sort of ignored Vanessa at first. Because as much as I like getting free stuff (I mean, really, who doesn't?), I don't really do a lot of product promotion here on the blog and I don't really want to start.
When the turnstile did stop as I was in it, an elderly Palestinian gentleman (who saw the passport I was holding) said to me in English and in a kind voice ”You see how you suffer, how we suffer.” I knew he had seen me speaking to a German student in the line with us and assumed I was also a tourist (which is not necessarily untrue). He wanted to teach us foreigners something.
What if I told you that Old Man Jenkins sits on his porch every day because he's scared of what might happen if one of the neighbor kids gets too close to his lawn. Say there's a sinkhole in his lawn that nobody can see, but it's there..right behind the spot half way up his lawn where the grass is dead. Maybe the sinkhole is in the same spot where Old Man Jenkins buried the door-to-door kitchen cutlery salesman that he thought was having an affair with the dearly deprated Mrs. Jenkins, (God rest her soul). Maybe every night Old Man Jenkins gets woken up by a knock at the door, and when he goes to see who it is he can hear someone with rattley breath and a raspy voice asking if he'd like to see a demonstration of the latest ginsu knives. Maybe Old Man Jenkins is afraid that if one of the kids disappears down the sinkhole there will be an investigation and they'll find the body of a certain salesman, so he keeps a daily vigil.
I tell this story because I became rather good at coming up with random facts about myself during my time as a sales trainer. When you see the same group of people in multiple trainings they no longer let the same ol’ random facts fly. “Sure Stan,” they would say. “We know all about your book collection. Tell us something new.” I was continually trying to find the random tidbits about myself that were both engaging and somewhat funny for others to enjoy. So in the spirit of openness, and to rectify my many omissions about “My Life” on this blog, I share with you a few facts which entirely serve the self-aggrandizement of my fledgling ego.

The interstate cooperation between the AWP and San Juan Watershed Group was further solidified last week by a grant awarded to the two groups through a settlement between a local coal mine and electric utility and the Sierra Club. The grant provides the groups with $500k to conduct a bacteria source tracking study that will address E. coli pollution in both the Animas and San Juan Rivers, as well as funding numerous public outreach efforts including a website, a regional water quality GIS database, and public meetings to educate residents about the health of their rivers.
The folks at True Brew Blog are home brewers and I suspect they’re doing a lot of brewing and not a ton of blog posting. I hope they’ll come back with some hair raising tales of seasonal winter brewing to jumpstart things but for now, I just hope they’re dropping in here at Beer Rant now and then since they were kind (and brave) enough to publicly admit they are “followers” here.
So, when properly translated, we see that Christ was, as usual, offering the alternatives of life and death, not heaven and hell -- exactly as he does in the most famous verse in the Bible, John 3:16. The sheep get eternal life and the goats get eternal death. I guess I am a goat!

It just reinforces what we all know: that books really do make a difference. But I do wonder what it means for those who join reading groups voluntarily. If it can prevent people from re-offending what can it do for those who have never offended? Answers on a postcard please.

“One approach is to insert “scatterers” into the stratosphere,” states the article. “Caldeira cites an idea to deploy jumbo jets into the upper atmosphere and deposit clouds of tiny particles there, such as sulphur dioxide. Dispersing around 1m tonnes of sulphur dioxide per year across 10m square kilometres of the atmosphere would be enough to reflect away sufficient amounts of sunlight.”

You know those half hour long infomercials for music? For example, Smokey Robinson and random woman talking about the great Soul classics and how if you act now you cna get 2 bonus CDs. That's 150 songs to your collection, and you can return them if it is not the best collection you've heard. Yeah - so The Coach and I spent way too much time last weekend after our long run watching THREE different music infomercials. I found it fun to try to sing along with as many as I could. By the end I was doing lead AND background vocals with coordinated "dance" moves. I was kind of disappointed when we finished them. I think the long run got to my brain!

Now I must pause and confess something to you all, something about which I feel rather chagrined. I do not actually read that many blogs. I know. This is crazy talk. There’s this whole great community and all these talented people and I really do not have any good excuse. I have excuses, mind you, they just aren’t very good. Excuse #1 is of course the fact that for most of the year that I have been blogging I was struggling to write a thesis. These little blog posts were my little breath of air before diving back into the sea of data that was my life. I didn’t really take a lot of time to read and what time I did I spent reading books rather than internet content. Only now that I’m done and procrastinating online more often whilst looking for scientist postings am I taking time to explore the wide world of blogging. Since I have been actually working really hard at trying to find work (this is the promised Excuse #2 b.t.w) I haven’t actually been reading a whole heck of a lot of blogs. Here, during the paragraph break, I hang my head in a moment of shame.

Or could it be the long-anticipated armed troops in US neighborhoods? Or that the Man O’ Peace had to sneak into Afghanistan under cover of darkness to give a 15 minute speech on how he personally killed Usama bin Ladin…a man already dead for 10 years?

I really struggled to find things I already had to fill my three jars. I didn't want to go buy thirty erasers, although those kinds of jars I've seen all over the internet crammed with school supplies are so cute. I wanted it all to be free. So I had to stretch the category of "school supply" a bit. I filled one jar with red and yellow yarn. One with empty coin rolls (let's just pretend there are coins in them), and into the third, I put the pieces to one of our wooden puzzles (much to my son's dismay. angry voice: "Look what mom did to our puzzle!")

A lot of my female friends, indeed, cannot understand my reluctance to penetrate the inner sanctum that is The Professional Athletes’ Locker room, and the media scrum that roils and tumbles therein. But a little backstory: I’ve done a few radio pieces about Nashville’s hockey franchise, and my most recent experience in that locker room—last spring, when the Predators made the 2nd round of the playoffs for the first time—was not exactly what I’d call auspicious.
I am reminded of another running analogy spoken by Jessica Herrin, the CEO and Founder of Stella & Dot. She mentioned to view your challenge as training for a marathon; at first it seems impossible, yet when you think of it, it is right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot. Do this a few times, and you keep increasing your distance. Eventually you’ll reach your goal.
And when I wake up, I feel, well, euphoric is the best word I can choose to describe it. Like just seeing him makes me the happiest I’ve ever been.

In fact, after my dedication on
The weight off of my shoulders when I realized all of that was almost indescribable. I was so used to carrying this giant ball of stress everywhere I went that I didn't even immediately realize it was gone until it was pointed out to me! I thought of the wonderful week I took off of work for Spring Break. My kids were at Grandma's, I had time alone, I was totally de-stressed but when Monday came... I dreaded returning to the office and the same old politics and the same old micromanaging and the same old crazy demands. I had to force myself to walk into the building from the parking lot, praying in my car for strength to face the day. After my Emmaus weekend? I was eager to get back to work. I was excited to be connected to the people around me. I was happy to do my work to the best of my ability and then go home at the end of the day, satisfied that I had done the best I could.

John the Baptist: Prophet who paved the way for Jesus. Beheaded by Herod, John appeared on the banks of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania and restored the Aaronic Priesthood by ordaining Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Rumors that he took a boat downstream and had a wild weekend with some coeds at SUNY-Binghamton are unfounded.
Just some background, until Jon and I met, Ceili Fey and I lived with my mother. Even though my mom has not lived with us for two or three years now, she is still very involved. Some of this involvement makes my husband very unhappy. Especially when he feels as though he is being crowded out. Yesterday, for instance, my mother just had to come along to the softball tryouts. Why? I dunno. She just did. I would have preferred that she stay home with the little guys but she just had to be at the tryouts.
Was the system of joint family better than this new age nuclear family system?
Of course we would like our teams to be engaged and fulfilled by their work, but when we tell people to maintain work/life balance and discourage them from thinking about work away from the office, or checking their messages, are we really doing what’s best for the business or the employee? Like just about everything else with management, the answer depends on the person. There’s no question that managers need to be sensitive to the signs of overwork and stress and help people maintain some balance. I feel sorry for people who don’t have a life away from their job, something they can fall back on if they retire find themselves “between jobs.” However, if people are truly inspired to work long hours and derive some fulfillment as a result, isn’t that a good thing?

If you are in or near Nagoya and are looking for something to do tomorrow, May 1st, I would definitely recommend checking this out. It’s free to the public, and you get a free poster for attending. Those who made reservations online get a little something extra I believe. There is various art from Final Fantasy games, Vampire Hunter D, and other Tatsunoko characters which Amano worked on that you can view and purchase if you want. There also original works, and everything can be purchased. The hand painted drawings start at 230,000 yen ($2870) and go all the way up to 2,200,000 yen ($28,000). Quite a heavy price tag, but he’s an amazing artist and I think it would be a good investment for the future, not to mention that it would make an epic picture for your wall at home.

There was a lot of laughing, some crying, some relaxing, some praying, some eating. We burned through a lot of coffee and tea lights and wine. We put our toes in the whites sands of the gulf on several occasions. We talked about what God is doing. We laughed at Jake the Jerk-Face Dog as he protected us from marauding giraffes. We petted Agent Mooshie and Dr. Love the Freak Cat. We shared life. It was a good time.
I was your quintessential nerd in school. Writing is my haven, my Iron Man suit, my quiet revenge, my no-judgments zone, my cone of silence. It allows me to be everything. There is so much freedom in it and it’s where I’m the most honest. Crohn’s has taught me that to make the most of my time; writing has helped me spend it wisely.
I watched the events of bin Laden's killing with a strange mix of satisfaction and fear in my heart. I was satisfied that we had doggedly pursued every lead for so many years, and that we had brought down a very bad man with no additional loss of US lives. But I was heartbroken by the reaction of the people who celebrated his death, just as I was heartbroken to watch Somalis drag the bodies of helicopter pilots through the streets of Mogadishu, and to watch some Islamic extremists celebrate 9/11. I was not in a very celebratory or joyful mood. As I was talking about the situation with my children, they seemed a bit surprised that I was not happy about bin Laden's death. They were not jumping up and down for joy by any means, but they were in general perfectly fine with it. After all, for most of their lives bin Laden has been viewed as a modern-day Hitler, worthy of our anger and aggression. And I don't disagree; I do not know what kind of man he was, but he was responsible for thousands of deaths and needed to be stopped. But I did not celebrate his death, and I was disgusted and shamed by the celebrations I did see.

Wellman was both screenwriter and director of this bitter-sweet romantic drama, and it was the only movie he actually won an Oscar for, as a writer. (Wings won the first-ever Oscar for best film, but he didn’t get the best director award.) The basic story is a reworking of George Cukor’s movie What Price Hollywood? (1932), which I’ve just reviewed on this blog, where a young actress makes it to stardom, while the established star who helped her up plunges into alcoholism and despair. But it feels very different – partly because the earlier film was a pre-Code and could get away with more in some respects, but also because of the personalities involved.

Any euphoria felt by the home support quickly dissipated as Arsenal recovered quickly, equalising on the quarter of hour mark. It was a simple affair, Rosicky and Benayoun combining to contrive space for the Czech to deliver a cross to van Persie, the Dutchman’s control of the situation taking him into space before delivering his finish. That was his 35th of the season, more than Stoke have managed in the league collectively this campaign. Their threat became neutered.

The expression on my face watching 8mm mirrored Nicholas Cage’s. What a dark, disturbing film. The thing is, this is not the first time I have seen it. I first watched 8m around ten years ago on HBO. It was the kind of viewing experience I did not find entertaining, yet hoped it was attempting to put forth some message to justify its vulgar content. I just worked up my nerve to watch again to watch with a critical eye to see what I could glean.

We ask for the Father’s kingdom to come. Along these lines, we pray for the spread of the gospel and the establishment of the rule and reign of the Father in the hearts of men and women. We pray for the welfare of the distressed and oppressed.

We also look forward to Jesus’ return to live and rule among us.
The biggest issue here now is that Jon and I are having to work hard to deprogram her from my mother. It's frequently like fighting an uphill battle since my mother still continues to intervene in our lives. Now, that's not to say that I don't want my mom involved in our lives, I simply want her to be involved, not to intervene in things.
The clock page represents the wheels of time going round. The background was embossed with a clocks embossing folder from Sizzix, then distressed with my favourite bundled sage, wild honey and rusty hinge distress inks. Added the weather clock die cut and a time sentiment from Tim Holtz.
Notes: I hesitated to include this restaurant because it offers only a wee garden salad, however I really wanted to make a distinction between restaurants who had even one item from restaurants that literally have nothing for vegans. So, I’m not sure if anyone is going to rush to the French Market Restaurant to get a teeny garden salad but if you’ve got a hankerin’ for lettuce, by all means…

This was a smaller one, I ended up making bigger letters. Then I painted! It took forever! I really thought this would be quick, but it took a while to get used to the paint and the brush. The paint was also really thin and I needed to do 3-4 layers just to get it as dark as I wanted.

Disbelievers may point out that angels are just another religious delusion to provide us with security. However if this were true, then why are they appearing in every religion, every art form and all types of literature? How could all these individuals, divided by time and space, come up with the same understanding of these remarkable celestial messengers and protectors?

After the meeting, I had some time to kill before meeting my friend for lunch. I drove around downtown and realized that it is a very different place during work hours. People were scurrying everywhere like worker ants carrying leaves. Except, the leaves were brief cases and boxes and all sorts of items. I like when women wear high heels, but, damn, it looks uncomfortable walking on a city sidewalk.
Oops I forgot to post yesterday, here it the pic anyways. Right beside my work a pop-up carnival came to town. I’m always looking for an opportunities to snap a picture, and this was just one I couldn’t pass up. The clouds were dramatic, it was about to rain so not many people were on the grounds. A Perfect opportunity to snap an over dramatic picture. I attempted to edit the picture in color, but oddly as much as I like colorful pictures, it was to much color. Maybe it was just dumb luck but I really liked the b&w versions mood much better.

I continued to stare, unable to speak. I looked at him with my new eyes and the scene continued to unfold in my head at a rapid pace. He was choking her and she appeared to black out. He picked her up and took her into what appeared to be a garage of a residence and set her inside of a large SUV.

Hello! I have a card today for this week's CASE Study challenge. The original card that inspired this CASE can be found on my post HERE. I kept the CAS look to the card and kept the colors neutral. I got this adorable mustache set from The Craft's Meow and thought it would be a perfect stamp set to use with these colors.

I do my fair share of flying, enough to know that should the air bag come down for some reason, I’m supposed to put it on myself first, before worrying about the person next to me. My life changed for the better when I started taking care of myself first, and allowed people to take care of themselves. I can tell you, their lives changed for the better as well.
It isn’t the same thing for Congolese adults of a certain age. Most are unfit. Though in urban areas some of them have the money to afford the few expensive gyms mostly patronized by expats, they won’t just go there. The habit hasn’t taken root yet, though President Joseph Kabila is fit and is known to be a motorcycle enthusiast. I was in Nairobi and, there, most professionals frequent gyms. But Kinshasa isn’t Nairobi; and those Congolese who are fit are younger and more often than not they are avid dancers. The typical young Congolese woman who dances is fit like this dancer of Werrason’s band (below photo) performing at Sfinks music festival in Belgium—though Werrason’s dancers have also a tough daily workout regimen that includes jogging.

These ideas became basic to the PCI - for Gramsci and Togliatti were exact peers - which is why it built itself not as a vanguard party but as a mass party with millions of members, why it spawned endless alliances and front organizations, and why it sought a "historic compromise" with the Christian Democrats, hoping to spread a vague progressivism across the whole of that alliance. By 1976 the PCI was winning a whole one-third of the vote and these objectives did not seem so far away.

So, basically I was taken in by what the entire, and it seems like I’m not exaggerating, entire Internet had thought. I didn’t question why Shepard bled where Anderson was shot, I didn’t question how Anderson even made it to the Conduit, much less made it to control centre afterwards before Shepard, I didn’t question why they were somehow all able to breath when the Citadel opened it’s arms to allow the Crucible to dock, I didn’t question why the intelligence that was controlling the reapers was shaped like the small child that Shepard saw die on Earth at the start of the game, I even forgot my initial reaction to the child and how Anderson was never there to see the child at the start of the game, which was ‘clearly this boy is a figment of Shepard’s imagination (a quote from me).’ I also didn’t question the intelligence’s assertions that synthetic life will alway kill its creators — Quarians-Geth, end of story — I also thought it entirely reasonable that there are only three choices: controlling the reapers; synthesis and destruction of the reapers, and sadly I actually thought AFTER he talked about it that synthesis is the best option, despite having to sacrifice yourself. He talked me into it! Not only was it a plot point, the game actually talked me into it…I believed what I was doing was right.

We can be sure people aren’t always looking for a long story from us when they ask how we’re doing, so we shouldn’t feel obligated to go into a lot of detail—but at the same time, covering up our feelings is not going to help us move forward in the area of being honest and open about the condition we’re in, either.

Though I'm generally very organized, I somehow never find the time (or plan for it) to make more gifts, more decorations, more goodies. I did most of my shopping online this year (thank you, Etsy and Amazon) but even so, the time to do those things that are so enjoyable seems to just disappear.

Well, this year ended and Adam and I are still missing the one thing we have been wanting so badly - children. But you know what, the Lord had really been working on my heart and I am so at peace about it. In fact, He has been showing us another way we can have children - adoption. Instead of having to be on drugs of some sort to not only get pregnant, but to sustain a pregnancy right now, this will allow me to get my body healthy again, so that pregnancy will simply come naturally in time. At first, Adam did not want to even talk about adoption though and I only wanted boys. But, after a lot of prayer and discussions, I am very excited to say that we will be adopting a little girl from Taiwan!!!! (We have indicated on the application that we want a newborn girl.) We are soooo stoked to enter into this new phase - as parents! We can't wait. We are almost through with the application and I have sent off to get a passport w/my married name, so as soon as those few things are done, it's just a matter of time. We are praying that the whole process (which could take up to 13 months to complete) will only take 6-8 months and that by next late summer/early fall, we will have our baby girl. We have already picked out a name for her and have bought some baby clothes as well. :) Any and all prayers would be greatly appreciated as we prepare for this new addition. :)

A group of ladies had Happy Hour at TRIO at the Four Seasons on a Monday night - organized by Allison. Just to show you how far TRIO went to make sure our evening was heavenly, not only did the staff expect us, they recognized us. If I didn't already have a lustful relationship with TRIO, I would have thought that they were stalking us. I started by a visit to the bar (I had chit chat with my favorite bar tender, Susie) and a glass a Reisling. When we got to the table, Allison and Jaye let the cat out of the bag. We were all presented with gift bags containing a $50 gift certificate to their spa services (can we say bomb diggity awesome??!!?) as well as some lotion and soap.

I appreciate the cold, venal detachment by which the executives of OCP make business deals and oversee developments while corruption and corpses pile high around them. Daniel O'Herlihy's character of the OCP's Old Man is an especially effective "removed" character. He is so far from human equation and insulated in the comforting cocoon of profit charts and boardrooms that you'll never again think of O'Herlihy as Grig from The Last Starfighter after this.
Amy’s been wanting me to send her links to different people singing the song in different ways. So, I’ll just do better than that. I’m making the different versions of “People Get Ready” my playlist for today. And maybe it’s appropriate to do this on Groundhog Day, except this would be more like a tribute to the movie “Groundhog Day” and instead of waking up to Sonny & Cher singing “I Got You Babe” all the time we just keep hearing a great song over and over in a variety of ways.

And suddenly I saw us all as the ordinary folk of a Reformation world - the world of Galileo and Columbus, Newton and Harvey - the world that could turn the space inside a great, Gothic cathedrals on its axis, so that the people gathered round a pulpit to hear an argument rather than before an altar to witness an event. I heard what was said as something akin to Luther's and Bucer's argument: that we should return to the plain, unmediated origins of our experience, and keep hold of the raw, analogue, temporal business of being human creatures who exist in space and time and community, so that we can take it with us as we also grasp the new opportunities of the new age, for art and understanding.

So, are most councillors being impartial in their view of this application? The answer must surely be no. They have attended and accepted the hospitality of BHA and listened to what amounted to a heavily biased sales pitch by BHA. Which is fair enough – but only if it is balanced by actively seeking out and listening to the other (resident’s) side of the argument.
I decided that with our current weather consisting of both warm and cold temperatures, the jackets and coats and backpacks and shoes in our launch pad were driving me a little bit insane. I don't mind the backpacks and either a coat or jacket on the hook. I don't even mind a pair of shoes for each person on the rug below. But multiple coats ans jackets, multiple pairs of shoes? Uh uh. It was too much and it was driving me bananas. So, I took all of the jackets and coats and hung them on hangers in the closet. I put all of the backpacks on their hooks and I removed all of the shoes.

It would also be very easy for me to argue that I simply don't have the experience of being in any kind of repressed minority which is required to write about people who aren't like me. I've seen this one a lot. I've also seen writers who have made that arduous effort to include the odd gay or non-white or not-able bodied character talk about how difficult it is to correctly portray someone who is not like them. And I've seen other writers say that they can't be expected to make 'all their characters' non-white or non-straight or non-able bodied, or you know, not just like them because it would be too tough and too artificial.
Use of polymer clay as an art medium has given me limitless opportunities to flex my creative imagination. This type clay has unique and amazing qualities and it has helped me produce one-of-a-kind beads that I happily incorporate into my beaded item art. Compared to earth clays, oil paints, wood, and precious metal media, polymer clay is fairly new to the art scene claiming beginnings in the early ’90s. The best qualities of this type clay is that it is easy to mix colors, shape it by hand, mold, cut, texture and cure it.

Typical of the way the commission works, though, Vassalos's letter did not mention was the very point highlighted in Booker's article: that a central theme of papers he has published with increasing urgency since 2004 has been the vulnerability of huge modern cruise ships to capsizing if their hulls are breached – the so-called "damage stability".
Elterwater is only 20 minutes’ drive from Blenheim Lodge, and one meanders through some pretty countryside lanes to get there. As one enters the walk to the lake, there is a little bridge, to the side of which is some rough water. We enjoyed seeing people trying to paddle up the little rapids. I have to admit, though, that I would not have wanted to try it myself as it looked very very cold and wet!
First off, let me say that present tense is not a reason I categorically reject a novel submission. But it often becomes a contributing reason, because successful present tense novel writing is much, much more difficult to execute than past tense novel writing. Most writers, no matter how good they are, are not quite up to the task.
Jack Lalanne Juicer Review – The Power Juicer Classic
No, I’m not yet tired of Garron. I think (I hope) that he has changed and evolved since the first book. Here’s a guy who grew up in a tough, but not criminal, world with little education, and thought he’d got out through boxing. When that didn’t work, he found he had no other skills. His decisions are driven by his circumstances and in some cases by self-deception about his own motives. He’s an introspective character and in fact the first book was really written not as a thriller, but as a character study, though set in a world with thugs and guns in it. He’s been described as a ‘tough guy’ character, but I don’t really think of him like that. A lot of thriller lead characters are called tough guys, but he’s not a 6 foot 4 ex-special services marine, with three black belts in martial arts, who can make a flame thrower out of an empty washing up liquid bottle and some sticky-back plastic. It takes more to be tough when you’re not sure what’s going to happen, or whether you can deal with it, or if in fact whether you should try dealing with it at all.

Elizabeth Knox's writing is a joy to read. Simple, but elegant, her descriptions invoke images of the divine, while continually grounding them with all that is human. You can almost taste the wine, feel the gentle midsummer evening sun of your skin, smell the freshly crushed grapes, hear the flutter of feathered wings. There are so many passages I would like to quote, many of which could spoil events that occur, so I will leave you with these few...

By chatting to the other customers, I discovered that the spa had only been open for 12 weeks but had already performed particularly well with the regional media.

Here’s ‘La Sylphide’ that about a month ago was virtually leafless with a few blooms. The non-rainy summer was very hard on my roses, and I learned something. Be patient with these roses in summer.

Arcidiacono observes that the kind of research Brodhead specifically criticized--"analyzing average differences in choices across demographic groups--race included"--is "standard practice not just in economics but in all quantitative social sciences," and therefore "to suggest that this is insulting disparages the quantitative social sciences as a whole."
Four more coats and it is finally finished. After the five coats of Sherwin Willaims Loyal Blue, I switched over to Gloss Royal Blue Valspar Latex Enamel, and I poured a wee bit of gloss black into it to darken the blue, as it was a bit too bright. I can't say that either paint was very good, as this changing table has nine coats on it to get it this color. Actually eleven coats, as I did a first coat, realized I need a tinted primer, primed it, then painted five coats, gave up in disgust, switched to a different paint, and painted four more coats. I persevered only because I had no desire to spend any more money on paint for this piece.
So let’s start with the spoon theory. This is geared toward living with a disability like Lupus that increases the cost for everything you do, and decreases the resources you have available to do it. It’s become a broader metaphor for anyone who is dealing with constant energy taxation that someone not facing this resource management won’t even see happening. If someone does not “have the spoons” to have a particular discussion with you, it is probably because of the people who got here before you walked in the door, and the demands those people made.

First and foremost, my work with the labor party (lpp): The amazing thing about working with them was that I met communities - home based workers in Gadap, revolutionaries from Landhi, flood affectees from Sajawal, hard core union organizers who possess stamina for 8 hour meetings. The bad thing was that I was from this side of the bridge, and as an elite, I too often and unwittingly succumbed to the limitations of inter class collaboration. I was too often called to the pulpit, given respect I did not earn, asked to join the Congress. But when I demanded I do hands on work such as filing lawsuit for our comrades who were killed in a road traffic accident caused due to state neglect of roads and lack of hospitals near highways, I was shut down. Where my personal skills could be useful, these were ignored.

This tasted way better than I thought it looked. The beets were mashed and a ton of garlic was layered into the mix and placed on top of crispy bread and shaved with what I believe was ricotta salada but I could be wrong – some kind of cheese. It was so good. It wasn’t as sweet as beets tend to be but had a very mild earthiness with the spice of the raw garlic.
c. An online ad, seen on the blog of ‘Archbishop Cranmer’, featured photos of couples on their wedding day on the first frame. The second frame stated “I do”. The third frame stated “70% of people* say keep marriage as it is ... (Source: ComRes poll for Catholic Voices)”. The final frame stated “Help us keep the true meaning of marriage. PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION Click here ... Coalition for Marriage”. The 'Issue' here is that 24 anonymous complainants, 'including the Jewish Gay & Lesbian Group' (doubtless disclosed to give weight to the allegations), challenged whether the claim '70% of people say keep marriage as it is'. However, His Grace is not required to respond to that point, since he did not conduct the research. But it transpires that 10 of these 24 complainants objected that the ads were ‘offensive’ and ‘homophobic’, and he is requested to respond to these allegations ‘under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 4.1 (Harm and offence)’.

From this point on, things devolved pretty badly. Many more and even worse arguments erupted. She ended up moving around between her parents a few times, and at one point she stayed with my sister and brother-in-law because she had nowhere else to go. Reportedly, she nearly cheated on me with a couple of close friends of my brother-in-law when they were visiting too. Apparently it didn’t happen, but it wouldn’t have shocked me. We finally broke up a day after she tried to get me involved to help her get out of a hit-and-run accident she caused. I finally hit my breaking point there. I broke up with her over text, and she didn’t really fight it. I think she knew I was finally tapped out.

In summation, we're at interesting crossroads here for Democrats; we're scared of almost every other Republican candidate besides Mitt Romney, and yet Romney is actually the most worrisome Republican to win the primary, because he has the best shot in a fledgling economy of beating Barack Obama in the general election.
Attendance at some retrospective and ‘in memoriam’ exhibitions over the past few years have given a taste for the history of art in Vancouver.

As the celebrations were recounted I felt a surge of emotion about art and this place. I wonder if it is possible to regain the passion for art that Shadbolt, B.C. Binning and their crowd had – which one of their own: Gordon Smith still has. Let’s see some footage of Gordon painting his huge works. Yes.
So would that explain that tour that fall in Europe, where you weren't there?
I learned how to make these in school in New Mexico, and I always thought they were pretty, but I never got good enough to make the really complicated ones (like in the picture to the left).
Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series
The nose is very difficult to describe in that it does have the usual Zealandian burst of roses and magnolia, but it does retain a heavy scent of raw chemical as in Ethyl Alcohol. Surprised by this retentivity, I actually had to let it breathe for about 12-15 minutes before the nose was consistent and pleasant. The reason that it shocked me so much is that it is sealed with a screw cup as opposed to natural or synthetic cork. But this little pre-shaped metal cap actually did a decent job of what it's intended to do.
I had a very similar pattern to this one published in Bead magazine at the beginning of 2009, but the back issue is no longer available and several people have recently asked me if I could write my own instructions for it. I had a group of wonderful 'testers' help me to fine-tune this pattern and so we think we have most of the wrinkles ironed out. It's amazing how people can interpret things in completely different ways and I learnt a lot about writing patterns from this experience - thank you guys! The tutorial is now 14 pages long and although it is written in English, there are lots of diagrams and photos to make things easier, and there are also instructions for optional leaves included. I made the poppy above in traditional red and black, but take a look at the 'Readers' Gallery' page on my website (under Poppy) as there are lots of pictures there that people have kindly sent me, showing poppies in all sorts of colours with some fantastic inspirational design ideas - poppies definitely don't have to be red!
It. Was. Awesome.
Truth be told I am really having a lot of pain… my neck sometimes feels it cannot support the weight of my head… ok.. no jokes about having a big head.. I know I do.. sorry I was born with it…. But I am not doing to well.. so with the previous titanium plate and the deterioration.. well this is looking more and more like surgery.. and then there is the issue of Tiri.. and who will take care of BOTH of us… so you know where that is going to have to go and whom… no not you…. I will be able to get a full-time care taker for the days I think for a week or two… I think my insurance will cover that… but gain it may have to be the other party to the accident that will have to pay for that…. and then there is the falling of my left eyelid again… and the added loss of vision from the accident… I try to be funny .. and socialize.. but it is a real effort….But I trust you understand….
For those of you who have seen the website, you know how rude people tend to be on here. I didn't realize how rude people were until a friend of my alerted me to the fact that they were saying things about me posting pictures of my Eli on my FB. The link below goes to the thread in which they talk about my baby. How dare people call pictures of my son disgusting, disturbing and say they will haunt them forever b/c of the discoloration of his skin: THEY ARE INFANT BRUISES!!!
I read in a group, posting about Psoriasis about a man, who had lost his wife and child because she couldn’t bear to look at him anymore because he had it so bad. Not only was this poor guy dealing with the itching and burning of it, but now he was suffering the loss of his wife too. He was literally crying out for help! If someone had mentioned Neem to him, maybe it might have helped him. It is out on the sidelines that not many people know of it or it’s potential. Psoriasis effects relationships, marriages. People don’t get too close… just in case it’s contagious. Little realizing it isn’t which then makes the person who has feel isolated and lonely.

I'd been doing well with posting usually 6, sometimes 7, times a week and having posts prepped and such. But I can't keep that pace up, it's just too much for me. Which kinda sucks really! So things are going to get a little quieter again, probably for a couple months, with 3 or 4 posts a week. But as usual, most of those will be reviews. ...providing I've managed to read enough to review. If I haven't, then, well, it'll probably just mean fewer posts. I'm sad about that, but I've gotta take care of me first, certainly right now. I hope that sooner rather than later I can return to more frequent posting, but right now this is what I need to do and I hope you all understand that and stick with me anyways.
The drink menu beats that at Applebee’s, of course — you can get a fine Suffering Bastard — but even here I was pained by some missteps. A “rhum cosmo” made with Barbados rum? A “vodka mai tai”? That'll snap you out of a reverie.
For many it was not just a war to defeat the fascists it was the beginning of a new society ,completely. A revolution in fact, unfortunately revolutions do not succeed when the people are divided. Their are many lessons to be learnt from this struggle, a struggle that continues to do this day.
The doctor couldn’t come to a conclusion and referred me to a hospital skin specialist who made the diagnosis of vitiligo. It didn’t bother me because I was a tomboy and really didn’t care how I looked. Contrary to what you may think, I was never bullied because of it. Occasionally someone would ask me what it was and there was one time, whilst on a guide camping trip, that a girl told everyone I had a contagious disease (some believed her) but apart from that I’ve never had any negative comments. Then when I turned 12 I suddenly dropped the tomboy act and started wearing make up. Unfortunately, mascara wasn’t my strong point so I would have to go to a beautician to get them tinted professionally. Eventually, I had to give this up as the dye stung my eyes.

In cases where you can’t get the site to remove the content that’s negatively affecting your reputation, you can create new, fresh, positive content to counteract it. The idea is that the Positive You will bury the Negative You. Rick Santorum is a great example of how this can work in reverse, and no, I’m not going to link to it for you.
Saying sorry is hard. It takes a lot of courage and a fair amount of humility. When we say sorry we are saying that we know we've made a mistake and that we will try not to do it again. That's a big deal.
In Tunisia in January 1952, riots occurred in the hara (ghetto) of Tunis, with one person killed. In 1956, attacks on Jews took place at night. The old Tunis Jewish cemetery was expropriated in 1957, and the great Tunis synagogue was destroyed in 1960. Violent acts were perpetrated after the Bizerte affair of July 1961, in which the Jews were accused of having fought alongside French troops during bloody clashes between Tunisian and French troops around the French military base. A wave of departures of Jews ensued (15,000 in 1961 and 10,000 in 1962, all to France). The Tunis Jewish quarter was plundered on 6 June 1967, and the great synagogue was ransacked. Jews were murdered in Djerba in 1982, and the Djerba synagogue was attacked on 11 April 2002.
"The weekend was good, though it did start off with a long lecture from E about how, as we aren't getting any younger, there has arisen an urgent need to visit expensive restaurants. I haven't felt this need, though mortality is always at the back of my mind. So unreceptive was I, that it took quite a lot of time to knock the idea into my head to an extent that allowed me to go to bed - albeit at half past bloody two. I am not saying an excess of wine afflicted E, but in the morning, it somehow seemed less important to her."
Nothing spells advantage better than a commute over a reversible lane bridge. At least that’s the pitch from Adera, the firm behind the NOMA urban townhome development in North Vancouver. With its central location at West 14th and Marine, NOMA offers residents the advantage of choosing between the Lions Gate or the Second Narrows to make it to work. Either way, you’ve got a big schlep ahead. Go NOMA!
I didn't know it when I first walked in. I even took the photo before I knew it. I just liked being back in a small town where you can go to a place like this and see regulars and locals, which I thought he was. And the conversation started up easily enough--we were the only two people in the place except for two waitresses and from the sounds in the back one person cutting the meat with an electric knife. He asked where I was from, and I told him. Asked what I was doing in town, and I told him. I asked if he'd always been from Taylor, and he said just since '46, when he moved from Cistern, Texas. Turns out he left out a few things that the conversation turned up, like being a medic in WWII. If you're not familiar with medics, especially back then, they're the ones who go into combat without guns. They're there to pull people out, and can't fire back, thought they were frequent and favorite targets of the other side. Shooting a medic meant wounded soldiers would continue to draw resources in order to get them off the field, or even more frequently, die before another medic could get to them. So if anyone has earned the right to have a long life in a quiet sleepy town doing what he loves in a way that makes him a legend at it, it's Vencil. And it's a bit funny that one of the best BBQ places in town is hidden damn near under a bridge behind this door:

Arguably, this lack of knowledge in Hong Kong may be the result of the inadequacies in education. An in-depth study conducted by Lam (1997) on the sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of secondary school pupils revealed a number of deficiencies in sex knowledge. Prior to Lams’ study, investigations in Hong Kong focused primarily on the biology of sexual behavior and were unable to provide a full picture of students’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to sex. Dr. Lams’ study was designed comprehensively and covers the biology of sex, personal identity and self-concept, social issues related to human sexuality, deviant psychology, and other aspects of love, marriage, and parenting, as well as the implementation of HIV prevention education.

For the sake of time, let’s speed through the last ones. Cruiserweight and Light Heavyweight. Same difference, stupid name on the latter, glad they’re gone, still mad that the weight cap on it was 215-220 pounds and the heaviest champion was 260, but what’s done is done. The Women’s and Divas titles are exclusively for women, good job, get a decent roster and it’ll mean something. Technically it means little now because the second a man won the title of Miss Wrestlemania all logic went down the drain, no matter how entertaining the guy appeared to be. Question: who is the Divas champion right now? See, you don’t know, because it doesn’t matter. Or, as Elaine Stritch so beautifully puts it:
The consequences of my failure to swallow my pride and frustration at not getting my way were that I was barred from participation in the activities I wanted to do. I had to go wait in the car while everyone else had dinner at our favorite Mexican restaurant, El Paisanos. Or I could go sit in my room while my friends had my birthday party without me. As a little kid, I think it is fair to say that being included in fun stuff is important. And so, her tactic was effective.

Nothing had been resolved. No agreement reached. Hayley yearned to jump up and take her daughter in her arms and reveal the truth, just like that, shattering the illusion that had become their lives for so many years. But as Lily-Rose entered the living room, her blue eyes darting from one sister to another, Hayley knew she would not do anything so rash again.

My mediafire account is suspended. Of course nothing can be done now to restore the damage done, but I was expecting if someone wanted one of my uploads to be removed, to request-demand it through an email or a comment (needless to say that all such demands up to now were satisfied without any objection), and not to suspend my whole account. To be honest though, when I started this blog I had in my mind that something like that would happen.

Someone who got her Oscar was my favorite of all time, Meryl Streep. She hasn’t won as many Oscars as she has been nominated for. Of all the 17 she has been nominated to only 3 of them did she win. The first one was for the best supporting actress in the film Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), and the latest as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady and with the announcement of receiving her third gave her probably the most funny, surprised look I have ever seen. Of course she has been nominated so many times and only won a few, which gives her the right to be extremely surprised in the end. But I have to say, she was brilliant as a Margaret Thatcher.
though my heart is very sad.

In order to enter the competition, applicants must be final-year students or recent graduates of a university or prestigious school, who have specialised in science or technology. Entry to the competition takes the form of a 500-word submission describing a technological innovation in one of eight areas related to F1 development: aerodynamics, control systems and electronics, design and analysis, performance engineering, power train energy recovery, materials research and development, transducers and test technology or vehicle dynamics. The focus of the presentation is on how this innovation can improve car performance, and how the student plans to conduct the project over the six-month internship. The entry period lasts from March 22 to May 28 2010, with the finalists to be announced on June 14. The 2010 Altran Academy will feature representatives from 18 countries that reflect Altran’s positioning and international reach. They are organised into 11 global regions, and each region will provide one finalist in the competition. These 11 finalists will present their projects to an expert jury chaired by Robin Tuluie, Head of R&D at the Renault F1 Team, on July 13 2010 at the team’s Enstone headquarters. The winning finalists will begin their placements in September 2010.
We said good night and headed back for the compound. So now, I’m relaxing with the brown, wooden shutters open, listening to the sounds of celebration music in the distance and crickets making their presence known.
WRITE CLUB is, as you may have guessed, so named for its rhyming with Fight Club. But while Fight Club’s fights were metaphors for the disillusionment of a generation of men who found the world beyond saving and unworthy of their respect, finding meaning in the only genuine human bonds they could find, namely, the physical bonds of a fight, WRITE CLUB is no metaphor. WRITE CLUB is real. WRITE CLUB is a battle of the mind that takes no prisoners, that is to say, the losers are literally killed on stage (disclaimer: in actuality, losers are respectfully told they did a good job).

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED watching the kids create these whimsical cityscapes and overheard one little guy saying, "I just love my city!!" This was a great springboard for discussion about color, repetition, balance and size. It was also one of those "no-fail" projects where ALL the results would look fabulous framed and hanging on a wall! The last class had a few extra minutes and we looked at an architectural ABC book I have that generated even more discussion. I would do this lesson again in a nanosecond!!!!

For many years the Jesuits have prevented the United States from developing additional sources of energy within its own territory. Exploiting the vast oilfields on the Alaskan north slope, that probably contain more oil than the entire middle east, is forbidden. New nuclear power plants, the safest source of electric energy ever discovered, are not permitted. There is no end to the lies people have been made to believe about Nuclear energy. The environment is used as the club to subdue the people of the country into going along with this idiocy. Modern technology is able to develop these sources of power without any damage to the environment. Needless to say, without sufficient energy, the United States will not be able to defend itself. All the papacy has to do is cut off the oil supply from the middle east.
I love the concept, and the design meets the requirements for an efficient Hybrid Car. But they say the top speed is around 85mph, so can you imagine trying to drive this car in the HOV lane at around 60-70mph?? If you do, be prepared for some swearing and honking!:) Also, despite their safety commitments, I find it a bit hard to imagine that such a design could be stable and safe, and car doesn't really start "flying" in the high-california-winds!!

The French pharmacy is different, it's not like others. For me, visiting the French pharmacy is more about browsing and shopping than it is about the medicinal. There is a behind the counter section that is jam packed with medications that could cure any ailment and there are myriads of other more interesting products on show. The French love a pharmacy as much as they love a hairdresser, a pâtisserie and a boulangerie...

As I stared towards the shore, I noticed what appeared like a pencil line on the horizon. Studying the horizon, the pencil line appeared to be becoming wider. After awhile, I realized the strange site was the first signs of an approaching thunderstorm. Within a few minutes, the dark cloud was obvious and the lifting air started clearing the haze to the north. The thick, almost black, area became more distinct and an occasional bolt of lightning would stand in stark contrast to the dark clouds. I could now see the roll cloud which extended along the edge of the storm. It would arrive at the beach within minutes. Behind the cloud, a solid gray sheet of rain obscured everything. Fascinated, since I'd never seen anything like this before, I was determined to watch until it arrived.
The breathtaking audacity of our House managers, in essentially conceding a step on the public option while grabbing one-third of the population for Medicaid, I think shows us the way forward. Now, I have long argued that there is a great virtue in taking the long view when it comes to health care reform, but I think we can now see the particular mechanism by which the normal amendment and re-authorization process can be used to push the process forward.

And the way he just sat down in the midst and behaved like this was his own living room! He was always like this in the temple, like nowhere else. He would lounge about, watching the proceedings. Often he didn’t even preach or minister. Now, the more he relaxed, the more everyone else got on edge. Hopefully he would soon get on with whatever it was he had planned. Several of the Pharisees had gathered and were conferring about something, their eyes like daggers probing Jesus’ position; then one of them left, apparently on some kind of errand. They were always plotting, never anything good. The less time they had, the better. Keep one step ahead, that was the best defence against them. It was a miracle Jesus hadn’t been taken into custody already.

So if you guys being following me for a while you'd know that i have very sensitive/allergy prone skin.. and about 2 months ago i started to have mild allergy attacks at night... i mean it lasted a awhile then i was on medication so it was gone, and while i was in china it only happened one time so i thought great i think im finally over it right??? WRONG....since Sunday night, my body started to react very badly to unknown substance, and since then ive got hives all over my skin from my feet to my face...i mean it comes and goes, but its not going away permenately...and because the doctor doesn't know what i'm allergic to yet, he said only for me to take Benadryl..while it does help with the itching it makes very drowsy....and i really start to hate myself at the moment, like major self pity....

The idea was to get all of us (especially the kids) to recognize little things we can do to make other people feel good and to realize the bickering and fighting is a waste of energy and time. Some days they seem to understand the concept (as when Julia said, "It brightened my day when a friend told me how much she liked by bag") and some days we're not sure if it's quite sinking in (as when Julia said, "It brightened my day when mom and dad let me have extra TV time"). But hey, we're sticking with it and are hoping to keep it going for another 265 days.

Not content to let their children think, explore and make a few mistakes, they abandon their assigned task in order to make their children erase and redo ad nauseam, until their papers are perfect. I'm not sure when or where the children are supposed to learn how to think and cope themselves.

Winters placed the filled cans at the disposal of Smart Drinks, which then exported them to countries outside the Benelux. Winters only performed filling services for Smart Drinks and did not send the filled cans to that company; nor did Winters deliver or sell the cans to third parties.
Why on earth would such a warning be provided? Surely its presence actually highlighted the content? I'm sure that this would have made the book much more popular among young, curious audiences. Or perhaps this is what the author/publisher was trying to do. It certainly doesn't sound like the actions of someone trying to be responsible. The only responsible move in Scather's opinion would be to omit any such chapter in a book aimed at a young audience.

The past year has been a growing year for me. I can tell you that not one day of this past year has gone by without thinking of my Grandma. She was my rock...my constant. It's too bad we can't think of the ones we love that are here with us as much as I have thought about my Grandma this past year. I hope she knows how much I've missed her, how much I wish I could hug her again. I've tried to be better. Better at loving those that are here now, better at being more like her.

I could be upset that the cost of gas is killing me when I have to travel so far to do hospital visits. Most people here are not n the local hospital that is 6 miles away, but they are in the one that is 65 miles away and that means 130 miles per trip. I do get mileage but it is at the end of the month so making a couple of trips a week kills the budget trying to fill up my Explorer. You know what though, it stinks that gas is so high but I do get paid the mileage eventually and I get to make calls to friends and family while driving, pray in the vehicle, listen to books on CD, and things like the such. I can get a lot done on those drives and so I will not let it get me down.

I was given a project to work on recently and after reading the information I’d been given I felt that, although I was a little unclear about what I needed to do, I had enough of an understanding to be able to give it a go.

The only problem that I really had with the book was the writing style. It was filled with short, non-descript sentences that just fell flat. I enjoy adjectives now and again. The author also seems to flip flop in writing style. Sometimes I need more of a description of something. For example, I wanted to know more about the school, her neighborhood, etc. I felt like I really got no good details about Cassia's surroundings, so that made it difficult to picture being there, which I like to do. Other times she describes unimportant events too much which makes me impatient and bored. Overall, I enjoyed Matched, and I am thoroughly glad that I stuck it out through the rather stagnant first half of the book. It ends on a somewhat cliffhanger. I'm not throwing things around the room in aggravation or anything, but I'm certainly wanting to know what happens next in Crossed.

Black Shirt - Boden
It seems that Fitzgerald worked on the book for many years, beginning at the height of the roaring twenties and initially intending a kind of post-war Vanity Fair type social-observation novel in which the American Dream turns to nightmare, conveyed via the downfall of the main protagonist. By the time the book was published, in 1934, the Depression had set in, and the book, seeming to be a depiction of a selfish moneyed class and a bygone era, was less well received than Fitzgerald's previous novels. Having already worked many versions of it - up to seventeen - he recorded in his journal suggestions for revisions to a future edition, and after his death his friend Malcolm Cowley carried these out in the revised edition of 1948. In this edition the section dealing with the early years in Zurich is moved to the beginning and the novel follows a strict chronological sequence. In his Introduction to that edition, Cowley outlines the improvements this makes. The first edition, as had been generally noted, lacked focus and fell into two disparate parts, the first seeming to be striving to be the social-realist novel that Fitzgerald originally intended, and the second, after the disappearance of Rosemary from the story, the more modernist psychological study of the disintegration of one man. In addition, as has often been pointed out, Rosemary is both too complicit with the values of the Riviera society and too excluded from the mystery at its heart to be its successful observer. The editorial change unifies the novel by structurally making Dick the focus from the beginning, and the novel becomes more properly psychological. As Henry Claridge points out, too, beginning the novel with Dick's early brilliance and professional success highlights more powerfully the irony of his downfall.

But, back to our cooking safari, lol. She walks us through the colorful houses where we smell the divine scents of fresh baked bread and food.

This is a great Noah's Ark tale with a twist. When Noah calls for all the animals, the unicorns are no where to be found. Are they dilly-dallying? No. Instead they are busy with tasks such as saving a deer stuck in the mud or drying a butterfly's waterlogged wings. Everyone reaches the ark in time except the unicorns. They are left behind, but their kindness is not left unnoticed and they are rewarded in an unusual way.

Put the butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on low speed, mix just until the butter and sugars are blended, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture to the bowl, and blend on low speed until the flour is just incorporated. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the chocolate, and mix on low speed until evenly combined. (If you have no stand mixer, you can do all of this with handheld electric beaters and/or a large, sturdy spoon.) Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl, and then use your hands to turn and gently massage the dough, making sure all the flour is absorbed.

For its part, India would see its Muslim population grow from 8% to an official figure of 13%. However, mass illegal immigration from Bangladesh has swelled the actual figure well above this total, to an estimated 16%. India continues to be afflicted by endemic terrorist attacks, and faces the same existential demographic issues as does any other state with a Muslim minority. What will it do when its Muslim population reaches 25%? Repartition? Why would this repartition not then be followed by the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Hindus in the new Muslim state once more? How would it avoid leaving an Islamic seed in the new, reduced India, to start the cycle over again? When and how does this process come to a halt for India? When Islam reforms?

A WEEK ago the Obama re-election campaign unveiled a slogan for the fall campaign — its answer to Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America,” Bill Clinton’s “bridge to the 21st century,” and other successful re-election pitches. There were reports that the slogan-writing process had been a struggle for the White House, and the final product bore those rumors out. “Forward,” the Obama campaign will be declaiming to Americans, which feels like a none-too-subtle admission that a look backward at the Obama economic record might be bad news for the president’s re-election prospects.

I was a little confused with the fact that the book jumped through time a lot, and wasn’t always chronological, but as I kept reading on, I realized that it made sense, since nothing about these characters was chronological or orderly. I was even quickly intrigued with Bailey’s character, and related to him the most, as he saw the circus from the outside, and desperately wanted in. Readers were exposed to both the details of the circus, as well as its intrigue to outsiders, and even to the rêveurs. That, coupled with the fact that this circus was unlike any other I’ve ever read about, made the reading experience unique and unforgettable.
“Kibo Peak reached for the sky yet looked close to the touch, and it beckoned me to head for the summit, a temptation that flattered me with a false confidence. I could not have chosen a better relief for my morning stretch. I faced the mountain and stretched in ways that made me look as if I were performing a sacred rite. I bowed and prostrated my body like a supplicant in a traditional ceremony, casting my arms and legs about in an elaborate ritual. The sunlight painted the landscape in surreal colors. The rock was more brilliant and the shadows deeper and more pronounced in the sunlight. I turned around in mid-exercise and beheld the Serengeti unfurling for miles across the plains into Kenya. Some claimed that Mount Kilimanjaro offered the best views in the world. Looking down on the world below, I had to agree.”

It's okay to mix it up and adjust things as your life changes. What worked last year might not work so well this year. Heck, maybe we'll do Power 90 until school is out and then P90X in the summer when schedules are looser. If you're finding it increasingly difficult to find time or you're plateauing, try something different, like a different program, a different time of day, whatever. Because the goal is to keep going, and sometimes a simple adjustment can make all the difference.

My reasons for saying this are fairly simple. Most parents, even the ones who are connected with their children and respectful of their needs and wants, still need to exercise a measure of control over the children if they go to public school. Even if they homeschool, with a less rigid schedule and a more student-centered approach to education, there is still a control of curriculum, and pace, and achievement that, in my mind, is still beholden to an outdated educational philosophy with several serious flaws.
This isn’t one of those recipes that has a recipe. But I can tell you what I usually do and guesstimate at ingredients and hope that works for you. I tend to use thin-cut chicken breasts.

It adds another kick of flavor and crunch to the cutlet.
So what is the Dragons of the Cuyahoga about? Well, it isn’t actually about racism, although it does come into play. The Dragons of the Cuyahoga is the kind of novel that might come about if one happened into a bar one night and got a table next to Raymond Chandler and J.R.R. Tolkien after they’d had a few too many beers. The basic premise is that refugees straight out of Lord of the Rings began pouring into the middle of a football game. Chaos ensues. Suddenly there is a gateway into a feudal society where wizards advise kings, elves ride unicorns, and disputes are settled with swords as often as magic wands. Swann astutely answers the question: What happens next? Realistically: property values drop, the national guard gets called in, immigration, and national security become the hottest issues of the day. Sounds like quite the novel. How does a writer deal with such large issues? Swann starts the Dragons of the Cuyahoga ten years after the portal opens. All these problems have been dealt with, and Clevelanders have been lulled into complacency. Dragons may live in the financial sector of downtown Cleveland, but they haven’t eaten any virgins. Elves walk down the street everyday, hold steady jobs, wear modern clothes, and condo security is maintained with both door keys, and magic wards.

One can argue that—like so many men—Nietzsche perhaps feels more comfortable expressing his romantic desires to a woman, than to one of his masculine peers. However, it is easily just as likely that this could simply be a case of Nietzsche minding his audience, and that (for all we know) he has some ulterior motive for the divergent viewpoints he expresses in the two correspondences. Whichever the case, the fact that the philosopher is overall quite open in relating his apprehension about not wanting to settle down with any woman, is by all accounts a consistent theme in his communications:

Various experts are of the opinion that the ancient Africans, who eventually settled in Asia and Europe where radiation from the sun was less intense than Africa, gradually acclimatized and as a result their skin-colour became lighter. In scientific terms this means that the selective pressure for eumelanin production decreased in these individuals. (Click here for more technical info.) I must admit that it took me a while to absorb this hypothesis, but when a mind-boggling 70,000 years of evolution is thrown into the equation, then I suppose it becomes a highly plausible reality. One can thus understand why dark-skinned Africans who live near the equator in Africa don’t need suntan lotion to protect them from the high levels of exposure to the sun, as the larger quantities of eumelanin in their skins provides all the protection they need.

There are people in this world for whom travel is a breeze. These bastards are generally found in first class. They settle into seats the size of a Cadillac, drink champagne, and they eat fresh food that was not made of freeze-dried hog shit.

I realize this is turning into a dog blog. I didn't intend that, but dogs (and cats) have kind of taken over my life during the past year.

If it looks too dry, cracked and doesn’t feel tacky when you touch the bouncing dough, add a couple tsp. water and check back in a few minutes.
AAaaaapppril!!!
