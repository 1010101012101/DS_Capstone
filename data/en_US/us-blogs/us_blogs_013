I was actually pretty shocked by how good this was, and it totally overshadowed all the other dishes, despite the all-around deliciousocity of everything. Man, I’m thinking about it now and my mouth is watering.
It might be the Wild West in publishing, but as a former Green Beret, it’s the kind of environment we were trained to thrive in.
OK so some of the suppliers may not be walk-able except for dedicated yompers but just look at the number of local suppliers the Bladebone Inn has … including a place that offers courses on foraging, a local "open farm" (working farm that does tours etc), a local brewery, local markets, butchers …

Saturday morning Jamie and I had planned for our long run. She had 8 miles on her plan and I had 10miles. The weather forecast was not good. Weather wouldn't keep me from running, just from GETTING to our meeting place. I got up Saturday morning and the news said the roads were just slushy, but cars were traveling fine. (We had gotten some ice and snow during the night). I was ready for my first long run of this training cycle. And more importantly, I had new running clothes to wear! During the week, I had received a new sports bra from Amanda for being the first to reply to her tweet. Definitely in the right place at the right time that morning! Thank you, Amanda, it was honestly the most comfortable one I've ever worn! It's from McDavid and I would definitely recommend it. Also, I had ordered a new running jacket, you know, just in case we have more than one day of winter in a row. It arrived on Friday and I was super excited to try it out on Saturday. Since I love everything that I wear from Brooks, I figured I would love this too. (I did, by the way).
1) This starts from step 10 in Boat Quest Part 1. For a refresher, after you finished part 1, you should have spoken to your bard friend in Yaston (picture 1) again where he says he'll give you the compass back if you give him music to drown his sorrows. This is required to get this part started.
Put simply, worship that is God-centered is worship that revolves around and proceeds from God, not any human ingenuity, program, paradigm or plan. It keeps and maintains that the highest end and the compelling reason to worship is God Himself – responding to who He is and what He has done.

This would perhaps have been made slightly more pleasant if this one girl (whom I am having tuition with FOUR times this week), would at least make the effort to revise a little before my arrival. The concepts that she has forgotten are simple ones that only require memory work. They hardly even require her to apply anything. It frustrates me so very greatly because I am merely her tutor. I cannot do the memory work for her. I can only tell her what she needs to commit to memory and then help her with the application, but if she doesn’t even bother to commit said things to memory, then my presence is rendered pointless.

The coach for the side, Mr Roach, was very big on fitness and on drills. I realised very early that if I was going to ‘make it’ in this side, I needed to be fit. I had to train hard and learn the right drills and skills so I could compete to the best of my ability in this side. I knew I wasn’t the most talented; I couldn’t help that, but I could be the fittest. So I set my mind to making sure I was the best trained player on that side.

It's Friday already I can't believe how quickly another week has flown by! I am just popping in to show you a beautiful Flower blanket which has arrived from 'creativegranny' over on RAVELRY. I only added 'creativegrany' as a friend a very short time ago and this morning I have received a beautiful Granny square blanket from her. This blanket is another 'stunner' and each square has been made in such interesting colours. Have a look at the centres in the squares on the close up photos I'm going to show you. 'creativegranny' also very kindly sent me some Flower squares which are the prettiest things too. If you look at the squares you will see a basket of Flowers this one is just so different.

While cycling to our hotel at the northern edge of Canmore, a sharp high whistle pierced through the air above the buzz of moderate car traffic beside me. Suddenly I saw a row of 6 tiny brown-grey pikas shoot out of their burrows from the road bank in a high-speed scamper to safety 3 metres on the other side of the embankment. It was wild rodent action, all in perfect sychronicity within the blink of an eye.

And death, which I have always regarded as the greatest dimension of life, dark, compelling, was no more than a pipe that springs a leak, a branch that cracks inn the wind, a jackets that slips off a clothes hanger and falls to the floor.
I read the preview of the book, plus a few chapters and while I can honestly say that the book isn't my style (post-apocalyptic worlds don't interest me), however, I can see anyone who loved books like The Hunger Games giving it a try. In fact, that's probably high praise because I felt the same way about Socialpunk as I did reading The Hunger Games! Unfortunately for me, all the book reviews are supposed to be completed before the end of the month - but I have finals to give, and then grade, all next week so there's no way I'll have time to read any books in April!
Clean up campaigns such as these continue to receive the good-housekeeping seal of cosmic approval because we are now “apart” from what we have always experienced as life on planet earth (Gaia). As of this year we have journeyed far enough into the New living field that we can start to experience the greater power of Divinity that resides within all.

“Just a tad,” Tanner grinned as the two veterans of many a worse night outdoors played the game of who cares less about the bad weather. To an outsider, the “game” might seem like so much macho B.S.

One of the biggest problems with monarchies is that the enforcement of rules and regulations can easily be arbitrary, since the power is in the hands of the emperor. But the emperor had to strike a balance between his personal will and the will of his bureaucracy which he depended on to run the state. There were constant conflicts, sometimes subtle and sometimes turbulent, between the two powers.

The heraldic artist takes this written description and ‘translates’ it into a recognisable image. The art of course came before the language, which as we have seen was needed to bring some kind of governance and stop people from adopting the same devices in the same form on their shields or personal seals.

Though they primarily played cover songs, Greg and Martin started writing original songs together. The two of them would trade off lead vocal duties and focus on harmonies. They eventually recruited Jim Keller and Scott Krueger, both of whom Martin had known from their stints with In A Hot Coma.
This is good news for people who feel their thumbs twitch at the thought of sitting still. But it is surprising, maybe even unwelcome or abrasive, news for those who have spent a lifetime seeking inner peace through stillness, meditation and prayer. Those who rely on “The Power of Now” to find peace might find the idea of spiritual enlightenment through Becoming rather than Being counter-intuitive.
A term we always hear when politicians or the media talk about the war in the Middle East. Wiki defines it as a means of leaving one’s current situation, either after a predetermined objective has been achieved, or as a strategy to mitigate failure. In warfare, an exit strategy is understood to minimize losses.

Supply (Pottstown, PA) 1:40 p.m.
Lately, it has been raining every single day here. I love rain, but it does make things like running errands difficult. The traffic, getting wet and possibly catching a cold is a pain. Not to mention, the weather around the world is getting stranger by the day. It does cool down and sometimes I experience very cool breeze in the evening. That's really odd.. Anyways, since it has been a wet day, I thought the best pick me up to stay warm and fuzzy is my own quick cheat Chicken Pot Pie. No rue/ roux required. Plus I have promised my brother yonks ago that I will cook him my Chicken Pot Pie.

Art historian Richard Shiff describes doubt and belief as two extremes on a continuum – doubt is a degree of belief while belief is also a form of doubt. Following Charles Sanders Pierce, Shiff states “If belief and doubt belong to the same experiential category, then a doubt is a weak belief; we feel doubt when belief is weak. Reciprocally – but oddly – a belief is a strong doubt: When the doubted fact gains degrees of acknowledgment, it becomes a belief” (Doubt, p. 25). Ideally, my practice exists near the middle of the continuum, holding doubt and belief in magnetic tension.

I’ve been wanting to do an ombré design for a while now. But unbelievably I never seemed to have the right colors. I didn’t have 5 of one color that I felt looked good together. When I found some pink polishes (simply sweet) at a discount store I knew it was time to give it a try.
Simple... but true. If we don't get rid of the things that are crowding our counters and entryways, then we won't be able to even see our fun new decorating efforts. All of our work will be in vain. Having too much stuff can get in the way of seeing the beauty in our homes.
Another era of the band that must be checked out is the 1983 to 1989 period that saw the arrival of Laura Salenger. After marrying Mark, Laura was known as Brix Smith, and her influence and overall style coincided with the band focusing on tighter song structures and not sounding quite as shambolic. U.K. singles such as “Victoria,” “Ghost In My House” and “Mr. Pharmacist” gained some airplay, and it looked like The Fall might finally break out of their cult status. My personal favorite from this period is “This Nation’s Saving Grace,” which is from 1985. Other travelers that have explored this region hold “Perverted by Language” (1983) and “The Wonderfull and Frightening World of The Fall” (1984) in equally high regard. Moving forward, the early ’90s found the band unsettled with all of its constant personnel changes, including Brix leaving both the band and Mark Smith. The overall songwriting seems to have lost its consistent edge, and not until the “Real New Fall LP” of 2003 is released does the band find itself on totally solid ground again. The constant changeover in band personnel at this time now seems to have given Mark a new transfusion of energy, and the song “Theme from Sparta F.C.” shows that they collectively still know how to kick ass. The easiest way to follow this crooked path that we have traveled so far would be to purchase the 6-CD box set, “The Complete Peel Sessions 1978–2004.”
When my wife first arrived in Scotland – Carrie is an American for those who don’t know her – one of the things that took her aback a bit was the aggressiveness of the language and not just the tone, the actual words we use to talk to each other. We know when we’re being serious even if the words are exactly the same. So non-Scots readers when they open up this collection might think that Alan comes from the most dysfunctional of families. He does, but all Scottish families are dysfunctional – that’s how we function. For me Andrew hits the nail on the head in the title story. Now a grown man and living in Greece, Alan’s returned home for his father’s funeral at which he gives the eulogy. Later he finds himself in the pub with his mate Cliff:

There finally came a time when decided that she wanted to go to a nursing home. So my mom and dad got all of her affairs in order, and off she went. Every week we took the kids in to see her, and they actually enjoyed playing bingo with the residents there. I know that she looked forward to those visits, and I do believe that she was learning to enjoy the freedom that came from not being worried about her medicenes. A few short weeks into her stay she once again became sick with pneumonia, heading into the hospital, and unable to shake it's grip, she went to be with Jesus.

"He was born Desmond Adolphus Dacres in St. Andrew, Jamaica and grew up in Kingston, where he attended the Alpha Boys' School. After his mother took ill and died, his father moved him to St. Mary, and then to St. Thomas, where he apprenticed as a tailor before returning to Kingston and taking a job as a welder, singing around his workplace while his co-workers encouraged him. In 1961 he auditioned for Coxsone Dodd (Studio One) and Duke Reid (Treasure Isle). Neither was impressed by his talents, and the young man moved on to Leslie Kong's Beverley's record label, where he auditioned before Derrick Morgan, then the label's biggest star.

Simone is now two years old. She talks. A lot. She’s taken to saying, “She’s so cute,” about her baby dolls. She can count to eleven and recognize some letters. But she’s using her newfound language abilities to manipulate and deceive. She tries to play Beth and me against each other. She’ll tell me, “Mama says I can watch,” and then she’ll run down the hallway and say to Beth, “Daddy says I can watch.” She’ll then settle on the couch in front of the TV, waiting. I’d be worried if it weren’t so adorable. She’s already a cagey character. She gets that from her great uncles.
And so, in order to better serve you, my readers, I watched a month’s worth of period Coronation Street. Unfortunately, the accessibility of vintage Coronation Street is limited. The closest I could get to the time in question and get consecutive episodes (instead of a “best of” set that wouldn’t capture the feel of watching the show) was December of 1979. And so I watched all nine episodes from December of 1979. For you. My readers. You bastards.
I decided to write this post when I realised that I have shared alot about the things that I consider important, or central to my life. And each month we get together with these families that I really like, and I wanted to share that too.
It reminds me of what we learned in our marriage preparation class: Love is a choice. True love isn't conditional; it isn't built on what we feel today or another day. If we only loved each other when we felt like it...well, I can tell you that there would be many days that I did not love my husband! Love is a choice we make, a choice to love unconditionally in spite of circumstances. Faith is the hope of things unseen. It is with these concepts that we try to view our circumstances.

For 17 years I followed Ellis's trail through moves, affidavits stating he was who he said he was, and doctors' exams. And then, "DEAD." In 1907 Ellis took his own life. Perhaps the senile debility played the largest part in his choice but I can't help but think that he was worn out from dealing with his health problems.
I am, perhaps, blessed with an extraordinarily vivid imagination. This is often a good thing, like when I make up stories to entertain myself (and occasionally others) or when I can see solutions to problems where all obvious options have been exhausted. It becomes a pain in the ass when it comes to looking forward to anything. Like holidays, for example. Because I imagine every detail of what is about to happen and what I am about to see and how it would make me feel, I often and up disappointed at the reality. It feels like I've already done it. The experience loses the novelty factor. So now, I try not to look forward to anything, imagine anything real, I just let the reality do its thing and hope for a pleasant surprise. On the other hand, I can imagine all the worse case scenarios too which makes it a relief when none of them happen.

Yes, I’ve had a sugar addiction for a very long time. I’ve always had a sweet tooth but I think the addiction occurred and took hold when I quit smoking. Instead of dealing with WHY I was smoking, I unintentionally transferred the habit to to standing in front of the vending machine at work, usually ending up with a bag of M&Ms to munch on. That was the beginning of the end of my girlish figure.

Created during the depths of the Great Depression, it seems fitting and appropriate to have revived this quirky work at a time of similar economic upheaval. Nonetheless, politically and artistically, it remains a museum piece. To put it charitably, Blitzstein was no Gershwin – neither a George nor an Ira. With the benefit of hindsight, The Cradle Will Rock reads like an attempt to graft Brecht and Weill’s daring theatrical innovations onto Clifford Odets’ homegrown agit-prop. The Fat Cat is our boogey-man here, and the answer is, what? Unions! But this is 2010, we know better than that, market crash notwithstanding. Not only are unions capable of corruption as heinous as any monopoly or cartel, but so are socialist governments. We may not like it when The Cradle’s cartoon villain Mr. Mister (Bill Newhall) buys off the church, the press, the arts and the medical and academic establishments…on the other hand, 73 years later, we also don’t like it when labor unions and big government push us around either. The very prescription the play seems to offer as an answer – a “closed shop” – gives your correspondent the creeping willies. I’m in the theatre. Your vaunted closed shop happens to be closed TO ME.
Curiously, the finance ministry which allocated a generous Rs 1,758 crore to UIDAI in the current budget against Rs 1,200 crore for 2011-12 appears to be plumping for the smart card for various welfare benefits instead of using the Aadhaar platform.

Suppressing a shiver Dr. Logan returned the sheet of paper back to the stack and opened his mouth to speak. A crash followed by a scream interrupted his train of thought. He tried to ignore the commotion but the disruption grew louder. Seated across from him John was seemingly unaffected by the noise. The shouting from in the hall grew louder. The door flew open and for a moment the figure standing in the doorway conjured up the image of Johns story. Dr. Logan’s heart tripped in his chest. He was not an overly fearful man but just for a moment he felt the oily twist of his intestines.
Anyway, why go all-out gore? Herschell and Friedman, entrepreneurs that they were, realized that a resource in entertainment had not yet been tapped into. No one else had made a color horror film that featured human sacrifices, knives plunging into flesh, body parts being roasted in ovens, tongues being ripped out of mouths. That kind of thing. There had to be someone, somewhere, at some time, that could or would exploit such a concept in a major motion picture (or at least as major as could be mustered), so why not let it be them?
Again we faced the future with medical help and a lot of questions. But our doctor and his staff were incredible, and we knew we were in great hands. Two and a half months later we were given the wonderful news that we were pregnant with twins! Like everything else we had endured, my pregnancy was not always easy. I was high risk, spent two months on bedrest, and delivered 5 weeks early. But our precious little girls, Brynlee and Brielle, were born on February 20, 2009. They were just under 5 pounds, but again miraculously, they were perfect, and were able to come home with us from the hospital.

From what I learned about how public schools handle bullying, the right thing to do is always to tell an adult, but it’s not generally going to do any good. There are certain kinds of people whose lives are just plain worth less to everyone else, and members of those groups always learn where they stand sooner or later.

Sitting on the left side of the page was a small series of words that drew my eye: three or four in a row, lines ending in "Vitovska."
Except, in the course of seven series we have had some diversity actually. In fact, going down the list of regular and recurring companions we've had since 2005, it's been something like this ...
Chest : 35 Inches
Happily married with a young son and another child on the way, Quinn Braverman has the perfect life. She also has an ominous secret. Every time she makes a major life decision, she knows an alternative reality exists in which she made the opposite choice-not only that, she knows how to cross over. But even in her darkest moments-like her mother's suicide-Quinn hasn't been tempted to visit . . . until she receives shattering news about the baby she's carrying.
Long story short, as time inched closer and the reality of us becoming man and wife was getting more intense, the love of my life said he feared he wasn’t up to the task and that maybe he just wasn’t cut out for marriage at all.
In effect it is the presence of the lakes that makes viticulture possible here. The region actually sits just above 42˚ latitude, the same as Rias Baixas, but upstate New York enjoys a climate of extremes with hot summers and very cold snowy winters – so much so that Lake Placid has twice hosted the Winter Olympics.
(For the theologically conversant - I do realize that "natural law" is commonly used to describe the uniformity of nature, but I am critiquing the practical atheism that often accompanies such ideas, since the Bible clearly teaches that "natural" causes are in fact Divine causes. The uniformity we observe is merely the "regular" consistency of God, while other "miraculous" events should be subtitled under the same consistency, though a broader definition of consistency and a humble, teachable spirit is required to appreciate it. There is nothing inconsistent about Jesus turning water to wine or healing someone of a grave disease, given that He was God Incarnate, maker and sustainer of "natural" laws.)

So where are you going with this, Snooker?
We found Hay St. Mall because, as usual, Bill needed to go to an Apple Store. I'm sure he wants to visit every Apple Store in the world. I've lost count of how many we've just had to visit.
Girls are doing some amazing things….women are doing some amazing things……lets not show them for what they aren’t.
I think it should be clear to the discerning reader that I would side with Henghis—not that I consider him an epitome, but he is, at least, a civilized being. What comes after him is definitely a rough beast. In The Spiral Labyrinth, we see the world after the first few centuries of the world’s ultimate age that will culminate in Jack Vance’s Dying Earth: a decadent, amoral Old Earth of rogues, monsters, and self-involved sorcerers.
That doesn't mean I am positive or grateful or even contemplative. That doesn't mean I haven't cried my eyes out a dozen times just this week alone. It just means that I know I have to hang on, there isn't any other alternative.
I must have caught our granddaughter's cold, or else it's an allergy. Hard to tell at this point. I do not have fever, and I do not feel bad, just a little tired. I have been coughing, sneezing, and sniffling, but so far all is clear.
Will this last? I doubt it. The black/white polarisation is growing and the rhetoric is becoming more extreme. Listen to the pub or workplace chatter, read the blogs and comments sections of the newspapers and it becomes obvious. Whites are gatvol at the waste, corruption and stupidity of the black elite. Blacks are demanding, as their right, the wealth of the whites by means of redistribution of assets. No matter that they have not worked for those assets, they claim them as the spoils of war.
Didjelirium is a sick individual, suffering from this lethal curse called ‘humanitis’. So death is mainly what the future holds for Didjelirium. Maybe in 200 years from now on, if there are still humans on Earth – I sincerely hope not, for the sake of the universe - someone will find my writings and/or hear my music and realize how prophetic it was. Or maybe not. And whatever will be fine. Meanwhile, I shall keep rocking my foolish boat, letting aboard all the other foolish dreamers I will meet on the way and telling my stories to whoever might be crazy enough to ask about them. Most of them are being gathered in this project called Original Fools, in collaboration with Damscray, from Orenburg, Russia, and I can’t but advise you to listen to it, simply because you won’t otherwise. If you need a genre to locate it on the music map, we do what we call ‘Spice Opera’. It’s a lot of fables about distant worlds and different beings that somehow, live and act exactly like earhtlings. It might interest you. But don’t feel sorry if you don’t, I’ll understand. I never expect anything from anyone, so I’m always happily surprised, no matter what. For the most important is not the destination nor any final goal, but the journey toward it and the people we meet on the way. So let the music play !
"First, Charlie Sheen can't really act, so just cast him as a rich, drunk womanizer who has to support his brother and nephew. Make sure there is no character development throughout the run of the series. Neither of the men, nor the kid, can develop into real people. You need a shrew of an ex-wife somewhere, and, heck, a shrew of a mother, too. Throw in a lot of bimbos, maybe a stalker, and then tell the same jokes over and over and over and over and, well, you get the idea."
People pressed into long lines often stretching for blocks to receive this ration, hugging the walls of the buildings nervously hoping that snipers wouldn’t detect the activity. If detected we knew to expect sniper fire quickly followed by artillery rounds.

There are many relics, and potions, and treasures in the jungle, some have been left from years and centuries past, and few dare to enter to find any of them, as the danger is not worth the effort.
My cake had colorful miniature balloons. I really wanted to eat them, but my mom wanted to keep on taking pictures with the cake. I was getting restless. There’s one picture of me where I’m squirming because I really wanted to eat the miniature balloons. I was crying I want to eat the balloons! I want to eat the balloons! My mom didn’t seem to hear me as she kept saying One last picture na, One last na talaga, Promise one last na, Smile, smile. I lost count at how many one-last-na-talaga pictures she took. When the picture taking was over, I grabbed the miniature balloons and put them in my mouth. I spit them out because they turned out to be plastic. I thought they were made of lollipops. Good thing everyone was busy chatting that they did not realize that I tried to eat the plastic balloons on my cake.
I fully agree with the majority when in its opinion it says:

The entire four-book collection is called the Twilight Saga. All the books in the series follow a “forbidden fruit of love” theme between a human teenage girl (mortal) and a "vampire."
“Okay.” He looked crestfallen as he obeyed, but quickly turned back to her. “It’s just... I’m going to get a taxi anyway... you could share it if you want. I’d pay, of course.”
Let’s get our focus right in life by taking the time to gaze upon the Lord as we read, mark, learn and inwardly digest His word. Let’s take the time to enthrone Him on our praises as we continually reflect on Who He is as the Son of God and on all He has done for us as Creator, Redeemer through His blood and Sanctifier by His Spirit.
OK. Not responding at all is one (somehow acceptable) way of expressing the medias disinterest and disapproval of my proposal.
Seeing as Eduardo Vargas is only twenty-two years old he could well have taken this award as well but in the spirit of fairness we will give this award to his team-mate Francisco Castro, who is only twenty-one years old. Castro, who like fellow award winners Vargas and Alexis Sánchez came from Cobreloa, spent most of the year living in the shadow of the aforementioned Vargas but when given the opportunity he grabbed it with both hands. Castro, made twenty-six appearances throughout the year in the league and eleven appearances in his club’s successful Copa Sudamericana campaign. He also managed to score his first goals for the club, scoring in the Copa Chile against Unión San Felipe. This kicked off an impressive run where he scored eight goals in the Clausura and one in the Copa Sudamericana. With Vargas departing for Napoli in the off season much will be expected from Castro in 2012.

A year after he died in a hail of bullets, there is at least some consensus over Osama bin Laden’s legacy. The man who sparked a decade of costly conflict by sending two planes into New York’s World Trade Centre is ultimately responsible for the deaths of many, many innocent people and deep divisions between the Islamic and Western worlds.

The recent upsurge in Miles Davis’ popularity is mainly due to an album entitled “Bitches Brew.” Released in the spring of 1970, it was the subject of a well coordinated national promotion campaign aimed more at the young rock fan than at the established Miles Davis follower. Of the close to thirty Miles Davis albums that have accumulated in Columbia’s catalogue over the past fifteen years, “Porgy and Bess”—with sales figures approaching 100,000—had been the most successful; other albums have averaged around 50,000 and recent releases have barely crawled to the 25,000 mark, but “Bitches Brew”—a two-record set—-has sold over 400,000 copies in this country alone.

Most of my medication, as with many other people with incurable conditions, can, very broadly, be described as palliative, in that it eases the symptoms but isn’t urgent – it doesn’t cure anything, because nothing is curable.** So how soon can I expect my GP to start buggering with my meds, I wonder?

No matter which way you want to look at them, the lives we lead are basically the result of choices made and events encountered at every moment of our existence. Good ones, bad ones, excruciatingly stupid ones at times, they all add up to create the patterns of daily life in which we live. Happy and fulfilling lives, sad and dreary ones, occasionally unfortunate ones in which we just plod on and on and on, pretending that everything's just OK, when it's not and you're silently screaming your lungs out in frustration.
The sheer lack of Dalit icons in the urban Indian public pantheon is not an accident – nor does the space lack icons. Ishwar Chandra Bandopadhyay is one such icon. He struggled for the legalization of widow remarriage in India and lobbied the British rulers for this. He is truly a pioneer.
I've been on an envelope-making binge lately.
Just because you resolve to do something on 1/1/11, it doesn't mean that you did jack-shit for all of 2010. It doesn't mean that you sat on your ass, thinking, "no point in do this or that until the new year". It's a boost in the right direction; just ONE MORE reason to do the right thing without delay. What have you got against it? I honestly don't understand.

Now . . . do you think your situation has finally backed Him into a corner? Is God finally stumped; not knowing what to do? Saturate yourselves with the stories in this book and you will learn that He is not. Don’t reduce God to what your puny mind can think. Don’t limit His ability to what you can understand. He is our faithful Creator and we would do well to commit ourselves to Him. Commit yourself to Him and let Him show you what He can do.

I wonder why I, frequently, feel “old” rather than “new?” I’m thinking “old” in my spirit, not my body, which is rapidly getting older.
What an amazing lesson! Marlita has known about the church for years...her daughter and brother were even baptized years ago...but she had always refused to receive the missionaries in her own home or to visit the church herself. She is a member of the Igreja Assembleia de Deus and even worked as an "obreira" for years (the ones who peform the blessings of healing) and always heard terrible lies about the "Mormon Church" and the Book of Mormon from her church leaders....so she never opened her heart to learn more. But lately, Marlita has been having difficulties and struggling with depression that left her softened and humble...so when Geny told her about her recent baptism and the new joy and peace that she had found in the gospel and asked if she could bring us to meet her, Marlita accepted.

And for now, at least, she still believes she's beautiful. She hasn't had that confidence knocked out of her...yet. How sad that you know it'll come. The self doubt, the feelings of ugliness that the teenage years bring are just around the corner. The 'why aren't my boobs as big as Jane Bookers?' years of torment in your room stuffing tissues down your bra. The overwhelming feeling of just wanting to be average, 'normal', not too fat, not too skinny, not too big boobs, not concave chest (yep, you guessed it, that was also what I was called) that takes up pages of your diary, along with a yearning for Gary Bell to notice you...

Stein drew support from at least two conservative local congressmen. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Alpine, wrote a letter to Stein’s commanding officer stating the sergeant should not face separation for an opinion shared by “a majority of Marines,” U-T San Diego reported. Rep.

Tata Alejandro dedicates himself to the creation of a great global gathering (as he mentions in one of his interviews), along with other elders of the indigenous groups of people who speak different languages. He expresses that the indigenous’ logic of life from every part of the world is the same, but they most certainly do not claim that everyone should come and learn from them. They have a mission to complete and this mission is to spread the message of the great ancestors to everyone living on this planet.
Café – Tram is the only vehicle like this in Poland. In the atmosphere of 1920s, with brass ornaments and a mirrored ceiling you can just relax on a plush sofa and admire the beauty of the town through a window. List of things you can see includes Wawel Hill with Royal Castle and Cathedral, city hall, Bishops’ Palace, the Barbican… and many more interesting places of both old and contemporary Cracow. The tram line starts on the Wolnica square, where you can see the renaissance town hall, which is now The Ethnographic Museum.
Without the ’cotton wool’ comforts, the world looks sharper and clearer. I can smell the rich floral scent in my garden, see the light filtering softly through the clouds, and I’m noticing how gorgeous my husband looks.

The only realistic way to upgrade the thermal performance of a roof and maintain the existing covering, is to add insulation to the underside of the rafters. Sometimes this can be achieved by effectively extending the rafters, but the commonest way is to fix rigid insulation with an integral vapour control layer to the underside of the rafters.

Some people try to make the movement’s incoherence, its refusal to declare what its goals are, as something approaching a strategy in itself. Ah, yes – the old “we have no strategy” strategy. Apparently, not knowing what you’re doing or where you wish to go is now something of a mystic state. Declining to nominate a spokesman, decrying the very idea of leaders and leadership, working to “consense” all your scattered issues is the new way of building a movement.

The twelve disciples are about to become the twelve apostles. But to stand on their own two feet, they are going to need spiritual help. The Lord was with them for three years to pick them up and pull them back into line. He is about to leave but He is telling them, “Don’t do anything, stay in Jerusalemand wait.” He told them the Comforter would come. This Comforter is from the Greek word, paraclete which means “to come to one’s aid or to come alongside.” I am sure the disciples were well aware of their need for the paraclete.. They were also well aware of the importance of this for the Lord stressed it so much, even in His last discourse to them in the upper room.

We were given a brief safety talk before we jumped on board. As the Indians had been so annoying, they sat in the back, while Aaron and I got the best seats in the front. Headphones on and we were off, shooting across farmland, forest and foothills. There was affair amount of turbulence, but hat just added to the fun. Aaron was grinning like an idiot as we ascended through a patch of low cloud and the glacier came into full view below us. The moraines and seracs looked tiny, but I knew that the small ones were as big as double decker buses and the biggest must have been the size of 20 storey buildings. The crevices went from white to royal blue to black, thousands of deadly traps moving like a slow sea down the mountain. It was difficult to imagine that this massive, multi-million ton slab of ice was more liquid than solid, carving it’s own valley as it went. I would have liked to have seen it at its peak, before it had started to recede back up the mountain, when it had been at its most magnificent and filled the valley it had cut. The glacier was still moving at anywhere between 1 to 7 metres every day, sadly melting at the same time as crawling forward with its immense weight, a shadow of its formal self. The glacier runs from top to bottom for 7.5km to a height of 300m above sea level. What makes it remarkable and very alluring is that it is also flanked by temperate rainforest. The contrast is striking, only in South America can you find similar environments.
The swimmer is made with a mix of Barry M Mushroom, H&M Love at First Sight and Hard Candy Splendid. His hair colour is Barry M Mushroom. Behind him is a shark fin that is made the way I made the shark fin on my pinky. I've added a little bit H&M Love at First Sight around the fin and the swimmer, it just gives a little more movement.
Our deductible is high...$5000/per person. OUCH! But well, Brian never goes to the doctor so I'm sure I'll be the only one to cost us a dime! But our monthly rate is almost $200 cheaper than what it was originally going to be and it actually turns out that this is probably the better deal. And since I already budgeted for $200 more per month then at least I can set that aside in savings!
A few weeks ago, I saw a post on someone's blog in which a button design patterned paper was used to line the bottom of a tray. When I saw it, I immediately thought of the 30,000 or so buttons I have stashed in my room. I used many of the older buttons that belonged to my grandmother who removed them from every piece of clothing before it finally hit the rag bag. She NEVER through anything away until it had been used to the point of disintegration.
Transfer the dough into a 9 .5 by 1 inch tart pan or pie plate and press into the pan with your palms, working the dough up the sides with your fingers and pressing it evenly around the rim. Trim any overhanging bits of dough. Chill for 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 325 F. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden. (I used a pie plate and it took like 25mns for me, for tart pan may be it will take only 10-12 mns. Keep an eye on the crust while baking and wait till it becomes golden)
4. Figure Out The Best Time To Shoot! When’s the best season? When does the foliage look the best? When does the water flow? Might it look really cool in winter? Often, spring or fall is the best time for water flow, while the winter or summer may hardly have anything at all.
Will the Muslims ever practice tolerance or accept peace with the West or anywhere else for that matter? No, never. The Koran—which Obama always refer to as the “holy Koran”—is replete with directives to fight for “Allah’s cause” (Koran: 9.88), to “fight and kill the disbelievers wherever you find them” (Koran: 9:5) and twenty other calls to war and murder. There is a reason why their weapon of choice is a Muslim man or woman who is willing to kill themselves in order to kill you.

Perhaps the worst case of Umno Baru lawlessness is the power grab of the Perak state government. The behaviour of the BN assembly members when the Pakatan Rakyat Speaker was forcibly removed was disgraceful. BN’s action was unethical, immoral and defeated the will of the people who had voted for a Pakatan Rakyat government to rule them.

Given the fame of their restaurant, and their own high profile, it will be very difficult for the authorities to bury news of Mr and Mrs Steyn;s death, and already the possible impact is causing concern. Department of economic development, environment and tourism MEC Jabu Mahlangu labelled the double murder "shocking and cruel" and lamented that it took place "while the world is watching us". He added "Tourism is our goldmine in this province, and such barbaric acts could deter people from visiting us. And here we are one of the host cities for the 2010 FIFA World Cup,”

Last week’s end, my family and I threw everything we own (minus a large, oak bureau/TV stand which committed suicide by jumping out of my husband and brother in-law’s arms onto the road) and relocated from Fort McMurray to Edmonton, Alberta. My children and dog and I made the drive through a treacherous freak blizzard that saw dozens of vehicles forced off the highway and into the ditch. Some of them, right before our eyes.

Business ethics is an evolving field of study in where organizations are constantly researching and improving areas on ethical concerns. Companies have increased the programs and workshops offered to help management and employees develop strong ethical principles. Organizations recognize that effective business ethics programs are good for business performance (Ferrell, Fraedrich and Ferrell 12). Ultimately, businesses are pushing for ethics to be a part of the core organizational values within the company’s domain. Conquering such a task can allow organizations to build the framework needed to reach business success and profitability.

We were thinking about something eternal. The feeling and themes to this kind of music we love so much often deal with torments and pain that last forever! You can easily find out more about it if you read the lyrics to “Immolated...” I/we are part of an ever-burning torch of passion for this genre, and the title had to fully express that. A burning torture that never ends!

All of Garrow's "Endorsement" authors are qualified by Garrow as "best-selling", "world-renowned", etc. I will let the reader use Google to determine the accuracy of Garrow's claims about these individuals. Garrow's book is published by WND Books, described by an editorial in the UK's Guardian as ""a niche producer of rightwing conspiracy theories, religious books and 'family values' tracts." WND Books describes itself as “'fiercely independent', telling the stories that other publishers won’t." The point is that the reader should get an idea of the religious and political circles Jim Garrow associates with -- the birds of a feather thing -- which may prove useful as one begins reading his book.
The crew of the Enterprise is still suffering from the aftereffects of the disaster at the Rashanar Battle Site, as seen in the first and second books in the series, A Time to Die and A Time To be Born. Even their help with the Dokaalan, as seen in A Time to Sow and A Time To Harvest, or their defense of the Baku, in Star Trek: Insurrection, weren’t enough to redeem them. Starfleet Command is still suspicious of Captain Picard’s abilities and sends the Enterprise on another mission where the crew is expected to fail. On top of that, the rest of crew has picked up on the command crew’s mood and the Starfleet scuttlebutt is calling Enterprise a doomed ship. Many of the newer crew members are requesting transfers off the ship. Riker and Troi are determined to talk at least some of them out of that decision.

In February of 2013, the first zombie animals began showing up. Roadkill on the highway would scrape itself off the pavement and limp into the woods. Pigs at the SuperYum Bacon Factory who were supposed to be dead suddenly leapt up and squealed. The sewers teemed with schools of once-dead goldfish that had been flushed. And even though the zombiepigs and zombiesquirrels didn’t speak any human language, everyone knew what they were saying as they devoured their fellow creatures: braaaaaaaaains.
Felice Schragenheim and Lilly Wust were gay lovers, who managed to survive together for a brief period in Nazi Germany in 1942-44. Felice was a Jewish resistance fighter, and later died probably on the march between concentration camps in Poland to Germany on December 31st 1944. She was 22. Lily Wust survived the war. Their story is told in the novel ‘Aimee and Jaguar‘ by Erica Fischer, and the movie of the same name, directed by Max Farberbock. After Felice’s arrest, Lilly Wurst made an audacious attempt to seek out Felice in Theresienstadt, which ended in her being thrown out by the camp commandant. This is Felice/Jaguar, her with Lilly and Lilly in old age:
I could rant and rave against this until I'm blue in the face and dripping with tears. Oh, I plead with you, if you are a parent and allow you children to watch this, please do everything in your power to rid your home of spiritual oppression. Throw that piece of garbage where it belongs and pray to God as a family that He would cleanse your home and your hearts and defend you against Satan's spiritual attacks.
I picked up my burger and grinned.”Thanks mister.” I sank my teeth into the meat and savored the ketchup on my tongue. I chewed the lettuce and tomato and felt some of the darkness in me fade away. Delicious. I’ve missed having tomatoes. I grabbed a handful of my fries and shoved them in my mouth.
The quality of the Duane Reade establishments themselves vary quite a bit - some are newer and more spacious than others.

December 6th I noted that I called my sis-in-law at 8:30am and we played telephone tag until 1:30pm. I was supposed to attend a Christmas event in her town which I cancelled as I was most upset over the call and her hanging up on me. When we did finally connect, I told her that I expected an apology for her going off on me and then hanging up. I also told her of my conversation with my brother. Her response was “what’s the common denominator?” meaning me, I said “Strike one! and I’m giving one warning only.” Noted we had a long talk for about one hour but think we’re okay. She called me back later too.

Jennifer I find this a very difficult question to answer; maybe you can tell me? I really love all things vintage, but on some days it's depression-era aesthetics that make me swoon, on others it's the boldness of `50s modern...and then again I am really drawn to much older traditional quilt designs (I always respected them, but now I am in awe of them) especially interpreted in modern fabric. I think I'm all over the map, but an outsider would probably have a better perspective on this than I do.

So, my pretties, what do you have to do to enter for a chance to win all these glorious goodies? Well, remember me talking about the Queen of Teen Award before? I'd still very much like to win that, my lovelies, and I don't think, so far, that we've done enough to get me there. Maybe it's not possible. But it would be great to get onto the shortlist at least!

UPDATE: 17th February, 2011. Well it looks like McInerney is coming to the end of the road, in its present form at least. In a special sitting of the High Court in Cork today the judge, Mr Justice Frank Clarke again rejected McInerney’s scheme or arrangement that was last ruled upon on 10th January, 2011. The judge found that KBC (the non-NAMA bank in the syndicate owed some €115m) would fare better effectively with a receivership. Interestingly RTE is reporting that the judge found that the NAMA banks would fare better under the scheme of arrangement. The likely next step will be for the banks to seek the appointment of a receiver.

In the film “Jurassic Park”, they described this (rather badly) as chaos theory. For them, in a nutshell, you can’t know all of the variables involved to predict any outcome. As a limited human being, I agree with this sentiment. There are people who are better at subconsciously taking account of these variables, but none of us is able to handle the sheer amount of data involved in predicting the outcome of even a simple flip of a coin.
FHA was originated to serve the moderate to lower income individuals who do not have the necessary means for the standard down payment requirements of conventional lending. This has changed in a big way since the mortgage meltdown and FHA raised the maximum loan amounts so that more borrowers were able to get this financing. All borrowers now want less down payment, more flexible seller contributions (which has recently change to be like conventional) and flexible sources of funds for down payment and reserves. This came about due to the economy and the conventional fall out for the past three years and this is now why FHA is starting to change the rules and regulations as they have default rates to consider also.

It weight about 370g which sis not light, but it’s a worthwhile compromise.

Alright! Time for another one of my offity posts! Yes, I did some more "sewing" projects! I LOVE the craftaholics anonymous blog and wish that I had the time and recourses to do all of her projects, but when I came across this post on wrist warmers the other week I HAD to make some! They were just too cute. Not sure what I will use them for, but for the time being they are keeping my hands and wrists warm while allowing me to type, so, I count that as a viable use.

Our Kimball has a tendency to stress out about things that are difficult for him. (Anxiety is a real problem for many kids with Asperger's Syndrome.) One of those things is falling back to sleep when he awakens in the night. At one point we gave him permission to turn on the lights and read when he awoke in the night, but that led to him being awake and reading complete novels between 3am and 7am. So we try to discourage that these days.

I admit that if you play WAB, specially coming from fantasy, this will be a bit of a hassle. Most people base their cavalry in 25x50mm or 50x50mm bases. This is nice, but it´s not that good for Warmaster or even FOG. And you know what? Most historical cavalry figures are smaller than fantasy horses.

This is great on a number of levels. But it's particularly spiffing because every morning, when I rock up and Abbott's been there for three hours eating fucking algae or whatever he has for breakfast, and asks 'Jesus, Dave.

Realistically lack of knowledge about lifestyle habits and their effects generally isn’t the problem, and neither is lack of employer support. What is the problem is lack of motivation, good role models and a realistic understanding of the consequences of our actions (or inaction).

It’s been almost 20 years since that day in the Barnes and Noble, and last month the thirteenth book in this series came out. Let me say that again: the thirteenth book in the series. I almost can’t believe it.

The earliest bridge across the Tyne, Pons Aelius, was built by the Romans near the location of the present Tyne Bridge. Built around 122, it fell into disrepair, and a stone bridge was built in 1270. This was in turn destroyed by the great flood of 1771. In 1781, a new stone bridge across the Tyne was completed. Increased shipping activity led to the stone bridge being removed in 1866 to make way for construction of the present Swing Bridge, which opened in 1876. The idea for a bridge at the location of the present Tyne Bridge dates back to 1864, due to concern about the cost of tolls on the High Level Bridge - although the first serious discussions took place in 1883. Committees met over the next three decades, but it wasn't until the early 1920s that proposals were commenced in earnest, boosted by the chance to secure central government funding. On 29 April 1924, Newcastle and Gateshead approved the plans, and the Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead (Corporations) Bridge Act was passed on 7 August that year, with an estimated cost of £1 million including land acquisitions. The final cost on completion was £1.2 million. Work started in August 1925 with Dorman Long acting as the building contractors. Despite the dangers of the building work, only one worker (Charles Tosh) died in the building of this structure. The Tyne Bridge was designed by Mott, Hay and Anderson who based their design on the Hell Gate Bridge in New York (which was completed in 1916). The bridge was completed on 25 February 1928 and opened on 10 October by King George V and Queen Mary, who were the first to use the roadway travelling in their Ascot landau. The Tyne Bridge's towers were built of Cornish granite and were designed as warehouses with five storeys. However, the inner floors of the warehouses in the bridge's towers were not completed and, as a result, the storage areas were never used. Lifts for passengers and goods were built in the towers to provide access to the Quayside although they are no longer in use. The bridge was originally painted green with special paint made by J. Dampney Co. of Gateshead. The same colours were used to paint the bridge in 2000. The bridge spans 531 feet (162 m) and the road deck is 84 feet (26 m) above the river level.

When we got home we both showered and met in the bedroom in our robes, ready for bed. As she took her robe off to retrieve her nightgown I went her and embraced her and whispered: “no night gown now please”. I opened my robe and wrapped it around her pressing her naked body against mine. Her skin was warm against me. My cock was stiff and extended out from me; as I wrapped the flap of the robe around us and drew her to me my cock pressed against her belly.
Germany and Sweden, each of which moved toward rough budget balance between 2009 and 2011 while sustaining comparatively strong growth—the average growth rate per year of real GDP for 2010 and 2011 was 3.6% for Germany and 4.9% for Sweden. If austerity is so terrible, how come these two countries have done so well?

Love in a Plastic Cup: Hotel Room Hook Ups
The beginning of the book was kind of slow for me. It wasn't the acutal plot that was slow, but the fact that I needed to get used to the writing style. I don't know if I ever really did get used to it, honestly. I didn't much like the strike throughs. I'm ashamed to say they confused me a bit. (and I call myself an avid reader...) Another thing that I also wasn't used to was the repeats of words, especially when the author was describing something. I know alot of people found that to be a cool element of the book, but I jsut felt like I was being repeated something like you do a child. I don't feel that it really takes away from the story, and the fact that it got a four stars is proof. This was a great great book. (haha, i just repeated myself, what a hypocrite I am!)

Since the band reformed in 1994 specifically to perform as headline act at Progfest ’94 in LA, the band had often discussed the idea of doing more concerts, a new recording etc, however, we found it was much easier said than done. As we have been pursuing our separate careers none of us had time to focus on the band, so nothing much happened until 2002 when I produced my second solo album “Oceans Of The Mind”. This gave me the push to contact Japanese promoters to set up a tour with the intention to promote Oceans. One thing lead to another and a complete show featuring Mario Millo Band and Sebastian Hardie was put in place. Prior to the concert tour of Japan, I organised a one off concert for both bands at The Metro Theatre in Sydney where the debut performance of Oceans Of The Mind was filmed (DVD due for release soon). It was also the first home concert performance by SH since we split in 1976.

Highway 96 from Murfreesboro to Dickson was my usual route back and forth between college and home for me. Naturally, if I had five bucks for every time I was back and forth on I-24 between Murfreesboro and Nashville, whether going out downtown or going to work, I could have probably retired on that. I worked at Southern Hills, so you Middle Tennesseans know what my usual route to work was. To see that intersection in Franklin on 96, and those stretches of I-24, with cars and trucks nearly completely submerged – just surreal.

I thought he felt the same thing but the thought only lasted for a moment because his friends reminded me to be aware of what we both were doing. We might hurt ourselves in the end, they said.

QUIRKS: Based on an incredibly cheesy, lame old TV series that I used to watch religiously as a kid. The series does NOT stand the test of time, so turning it into a comedy is actually quite logical. It’s too ridiculous to really take seriously, and throwing all seriousness out the window is actually an excellent move in this case. As was keeping Holly “my age”. She was a kid when I was a kid. Now she’s a hot woman in her 30s now that I’m in my 30s. Awesome. And no, they should not have used the original Holly. She’s too old now. [Many photos HERE.]

I don't usually go too crazy with my tea choices at work because there are no choices. It's the bog standard generic faceless bags at work. When I'm home I get a bit more exciting, but there's hardly any time for tea at home.
you could search our whole house if you want, you will not find any drugs. I'll even give you pee tests for the rest of my life if I need to.
Despite busting out of the gate at 20-9 the Sixers managed to go a mere 14-21 since then. This team relies on its superior defense, which is 2nd in the league in opponents’ points per game, and team play, with 8 players playing over 24 minutes per game and averaging at least 8 points per game. Unfortunately their defense will only get them so far against a healthy Bulls team or the star-studded Miami Heat. Expect this offense to struggle against the playoff-level intensity their opponents’ defenses are likely to impose.

2. Slow down and savor your food. Food addiction is difficult because you have to eat, but how you eat will make a difference in how you perceive food. Don’t gulp down your food without giving it any thought. Instead, take your time when eating, and make a habit of savoring every bite.
Jenny said she thought it was a book about identity, which seemed to me an astute assessment. Set in the 1920s around the building of the Bloor Street Viaduct which will bridge the city, it is essentially the story of Patrick, who, like the moths he watched flinging themselves against the lighted windows in his isolated country childhood, comes to Toronto 'searching', for a home, or an identity, or maybe a narrative of his own, but drawn with the logic and coincidence of dream into the stories of others, and in particular the immigrant Macedonian community. As Trevor said, the blurb on his edition bills the book as a love story, but it's not really, or rather it's more complicated than that. As in dreams, and as in Ondaatje's better-known sequel The English Patient, love stories become displaced from the centre, are left hanging or morph: a nun falls from the bridge and is caught by the worker Nicholas, an incident that hangs over the rest of the story like an iconic miracle, bonding the two souls together, yet later we will learn that Nicholas has married another. Indeed, as in dreams, characters central to the The English Patient appear on the edges here, waiting in the wings with the centrality of their own narratives. The language too is dream-like, and there are constant references to dreams - The bridge goes up in a dream - and, as in The English Patient there is the ache of loss and longing that characterises the most affecting dreams. Right from the start we are clear that the whole thing is couched in the dream of narrative:

Written between 1599 and 1601, this play is set in Denmark and recounts how Prince Hamlet exacts revenge on his uncle Claudius, who murdered the King, takes the throne and marries Hamlet’s mother. The play vividly charts the course of real and feigned madness — from overwhelming grief to seething rage — and explores themes of treachery, revenge, incest and moral corruption. “Hamlet” is Shakespeare’s longest play and among the most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language. During his lifetime the play was one of Shakespeare’s most popular works and it still ranks high among his most-performed, topping, for example, the Royal Shakespeare Company’s list since 1879. It has inspired writers from Goethe and Dickens to Joyce and Murdoch and has been described as “the world’s most filmed story after ‘Cinderella.’” The title role was almost certainly created for Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare’s time. It’s arguably the greatest drama ever written and in the four hundred years since, it has been played by the greatest actors and sometimes actresses, of each successive age.
Since U.S. workers are often 10 to 20 times more expensive than workers on the other side of the world, there has been a massive outflow of jobs from this country. Treaties such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership will accelerate those job losses.

Under the new program, unsubscribed visitors will be allowed to check out three “items” from the JSTOR archive every two weeks, which they will be able to read for free. In order to prevent piracy, the texts will be displayed as image files (so that text cannot be copied). Users will not be able to download the files. The depletion of the traditional professoriate has produced a new demographic of unmoored scholars who might not have “the consistency of access that they want,” says Heidi McGregor, a spokeswoman for JSTOR. The goal of Register & Read would be to better serve that population — as well as others that the organization might not have even known about.

A modern day horse needs to be trained to be able to put up with what is lacking in the human. Sure, one can send their horse to a professional trainer for a few months and then it comes home to an owner that will be less competent than the professional. So the horse slowly comes undone. The professional should build into the training of the horse, the acceptance by the horse to the mistakes that WILL be made. How many horse trainers do this? Very few. I find it sad and dangerous to see folks bring the horse home only to have a wreck. The weekend comes, or they test the horse immediately on arrival home, over facing it with the different feel and lack of consideration for the horse's perspective, firing it up just like they would an automobile come back from the mechanic.

Since I will not have any any pretty photos to post for some time, I guess I will be forced to do the year-end photo recap of last year’s garden. I was kind of thinking if I procrastinated long enough no one would notice that I hadn’t done one, but nature has conspired to make me do it. I also didn’t do an anniversary post. Gee, now that I think about, it’s generally not a good thing to forget one’s anniversary. Well, Happy Anniversary If only sweat were irrigation. You appeared on the scene one year ago on December 28th with fear and trembling. Fortunately, the fear only lasted for a little while, but the fun has persisted to this very day.

Sometimes the person behind you kicks the seat accidentally. Fine. Sometimes it happens over and over again. Noticeably less fine. Next time this happens start swing your arms behind you. Once you eventually make contact, turn around and confess “oh, I’m sorry, I, like you, totally forgot that there were other people sitting in the chairs around me.” You can replace arm swings with throwing ice cubes or gummy worms over your shoulder, and generally, it will produce the same results.

It was easy when reading The Hunger Games to envision it being a successful film. It had the one thing that every great action movie has going for it—populism. I realize that most people don’t think of movies in such terms, but when you get right down to it, the reason why most action movies are so popular is because they are such populist films. The Hunger Games is all populism. The elite government in the capitol of Panem suppresses the citizens of its twelve districts and forces a male and a female from each, between the ages of 12 and 18, to participate in televised penance for a past rebellion that results in the brutal death of all but one of the participants. Broken down to its most basic elements Katniss and the tributes = good guys and President Snow, the Gamemaker and even the rich, privileged citizens of the capitol = bad guys. If one were to take the purely populist route then Katniss and the tributes = “us” and President Snow, the Gamemaker and even the rich, privileged citizens of the capitol = “them”. A funny thing happened on the way to the cinema, though.

David Norris (Matt Damon) is a Congressman that’s running for the US Senate, but he gets pwned for some reason when a picture comes out that he mooned somebody in college. And since he was the only person who’s ever done that, he loses the election. While preparing his speech in the bathroom, he meets a woman named Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt), hiding from security after crashing a wedding upstairs. After a bit of conversation and a kiss, Norris is inspired to not perform his rehearsed speech, instead delivering a candid speech about his loss, which makes him an instant favorite for the next Senate race. Months later, Norris is on his way to work and being watched by a man in a hat named Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie), who is told by another be-hatted man named Richardson (John Slattery) that he needs to make sure Norris spills his coffee on his shirt. While waiting for Norris, Mitchell falls asleep and misses his opportunity. As a result, Norris gets on the bus on time and sits next to Elise. Norris gets them digits before he departs the bus and goes to work. At his office, he finds that everyone is frozen in time, and the group of be-hatted men are doing something to his associates with a glowing stick. But not probing them. That would be weird. Norris attempts to escape, but is captured by the men. They inform Norris that they are called the Adjustment Bureau and their job is to make things go according to “the plan” set by “the Chairman”. Mitchell’s failure has caused some trouble for them because Norris was not supposed to ever see Elise again and he was supposed to arrive to work late so that he would never have seen them working. They let Norris back into the world sans Elise’s number, warning him that if he tells anyone about them, he’ll be lobotomized.
I thank You Father for depositing within my spirit, special abilities according to the measure of the gift of Christ. No task or endeavour is beyond me for I have in me the grace and supernatural ability I require for every task, in Jesus Christ Name I pray! Amen!
Turning back the time in this short anecdotal recap, I was in Amsterdam before this train I’m currently riding on. Let me tell you, Amsterdam is a hilarious place. This is not the giggle-uncontrollably-at-some-unknown-joke hilarity that comes from the high-as-a-kite drug tourists there, but a different, more grounded kind. Amsterdam is like the Las Vegas of Europe: drugs, prostitution, and public drinking are all legal in most parts of Amsterdam, and the people know it. The city knows it, too, which is why most of the city is geared around this in a sort of appeal to visitors and drug tourists. Imagine yourself walking down the hodgepodge of narrow alleys and open courtyards of crossing rail ties in central Amsterdam. You look to your left: McDonalds, Coffeeshop, Sex Shop, corner bar, liquor store, gift shop, Coffeeshop, chips-with-mayo shop. You look to your right: there’s a canal. On the other side of the canal, though, there’s a pretty similar pattern there as well. Heineken is 90% of the beer served everywhere. All the souvenirs have some kind of motif involving Weed, prostitution, or wooden clogs. Every so often an alley will have a line of discreetly-drawn curtains next to glass doorways where certain ladies frame themselves with their best lingerie/swimsuit attire. Some have a routine of sways and shakes they go through, then repeat; others simply shoot seductive glances, like a grifter sizing up the mark. Some more just aren’t in the doorway, where you can assume they’re “on duty.”
The films were merely one diversion among many, according to Raven’s son Dominic: “To Dad his films (although they remain very visible) were not nearly as important to him as his work as an artist or as his contribution to giving black bluesmen a proper voice during the 1960’s.”

I would go to the store and when I got home he wanted to know what took so long, "I was worried that you had car trouble." "No, just ran into a friend and we went for a soft drink." He thought it was thoughtless of me to not let him know I was delayed. I thought, "are you kidding, you never cared before."
This may sound deluded, but when Rosemarie and Ingrid started slapping one another (Rosemarie took exception to being called a whore), I imagined they were fighting for my affection: Rosemarie: He's mine! He's one of the few people who appreciates the largeness of my stunning ass. Ingrid: What are you nuts? He obviously prefers to be with me. I mean, have you seen his wrists? They're so dainty, and the dainty wristed can't help but flock to my box. (End scene.)

Fundamentally that was the reason for "going dark" both in terms of keeping in touch but also mood and general well being. Basically I spiked a temperature and that meant I had to go back in to hospital on to the ward, I think it may have been triggered from the hip biopsy I had on the 16th October.
Why am I craft blogging on Easter? because I am “home alone 2″. I stayed at home on Christmas because I had just had surgery.

So y’all eat some ham and coconut cake for me!

I haven't been around much (again), but I haven't been comepletely procrastinating. Well, maybe just a little bit, but not overly so.

Starting with white as their canvas, Lyndsay and Fitzhugh gave reclaimed materials new life – creating a couch out of recycled ceiling beams, the fireplace sculpture from wood scraps – and mixed them effortlessly with more contemporary pieces. An Ikea sideboard sits next to an Indian daybed, and a 1920s cast iron kitchen sink lives in a custom stone countertop. “The old materials,” Fitzhugh says, “help the new ones make sense.”
Anyway, my roommate picked up the book and I regrettably drank the Kool-Aid. While I wanted to see what all the hype was about and it gave me a good laugh because it was so awful it was awesome there were times when I had to put it down and not look at it for like 2 hours. How did this crapola get published? It wasn’t even hot, some of it was just downright disgusting. I won’t spoil it if you really want to read it and also because I may spew everywhere if I type it out, but if you really want to know what I’m referring to, I suggest looking up the band L7 and their 1992 controversy. Needless to say I read the first one just to see, but I absolutely refused to finish the trilogy. Not only because it should be called 50 Shades of Vomit with regards to some of the material and also the dialogue between the 2 main characters but also because the plot line is SO ridiculous. Does this woman have NO concept of time? How can all of this go down in only like a week’s time period. I spent a good 3 years of my life watching the soap opera Passions and 50 Shades makes that look like Masterpiece theatre. So just how far will I go to avoid reading the other 2 books? I present a list of 50 things I’d rather read than finish the 50 shades trilogy.
Having resisted the temptation to give my primary fictional characters German shepherds, I've given the GSDs walk-on roles in a number of novels. Dogs and cats weave in and out of all the books in the series. I notice I've had a particular fondness for black Labrador retrievers, which pop up in a number of books. Duncan's parents have a lovely border collie. One of my favorite fictional dogs has been Mo, the English mastiff in Where Memories Lie (Wm. Morrow, 2008). Mo was modeled on a real English mastiff named Big Mo. Big Mo's owners bid at a Humane Society auction for the opportunity to have him appear in a book, and I hope I did him justice. I certainly enjoyed spending a book with him, drool and all. I particularly love the scene where he eats the tub of ice cream.
Meanwhile Callie is working on a man who fell off a garbage truck during his work and his hand is severely damaged. She tells him that he might lose a couple of fingers when he becomes very upset. He digs through his bag to find his phone when he accidentally pulls out a tool. Callie freaks out, which is only natural since she’s giving him really bad news. Add to that the shooter Callie came face to face with and you got a solid reason to freak and she steps back. The man tells her it is not a weapon but he’s a wood-carver and he makes prints with the carved wood plates. He has a lot of downtime on his job so he takes his tools with him everywhere he goes. Callie is impressed with his skills and promises him that she’s an artist too and that she will do whatever it takes to save his hand. She does with a stack of hardware and says with lots and lots therapy she’s convinced he’ll be able to do what he always used to do.

Rejection letters come in many forms. I’ve had compliment slips that read ‘Not this time’ (a favourite phrase of editors and agents as if to imply that there might actually be a time). Then there’s the formal letter which is sent with every manuscript that doesn’t take their fancy. When I say ‘their fancy’, I mean the fancy of the eighteen year old trainee who they’ve hired to open every envelope in their slush pile and tip the contents into the Self-Addressed Envelope. I figure most agents are off cosying up to the next Z list celebrity to whom they’ve offered a book deal.

I started off reading the first in Pamela Palmers Feral series, Desire Untamed. I have to admit that it took a little while for me to get into the story. But as is the case with many first books in a series, it takes a little backtracking to bring the reader up to speed on where the author is planning to go with her story. By the time I picked up the second book, Obsession Untamed, I was hooked. Now, I realize that there are a thousand (that’s probably an undercount) different paranormal series out there, and the shape shifter’s have their fair share of them. I was pleasantly surprised by her “POV”, I mean if an author can write something that makes me forget all of the other storylines before hers, than I’ve found a winner.

This week’s challenge is to evaluate how realistic you efforts are for an unexpected emergency level evacuation of your home. In the case of a tornado or fire (of which many have been in recent news) it is necessary to not only leave your home quickly, but to do so with whatever you need to survive.

On the subject of wildlife, I had a bit of an upset this morning. The BBC Planet Earth Live starts on Sunday and I am really looking forward to it. Part of the show is featuring black bears from Minnesota. Some of you will remember the most delightful three part film called The Bear Family & Me that was filmed by Gordon Buchanan, a Scottish wildlife photographer/camera man. The films focused on a little bear cub called Hope, and her mother, Lily. I had hoped that Planet Earth Live would give us a chance to catch up with Hope and see how she is doing but I learned this morning that it is thought she has been killed by hunters. A year old. And shot for sport. I am not ashamed to say that I had a good cry. Godammit, it makes me so angry.

By doing this I don’t mean to state conclusively that this is happening in any groups in particular. To ignore the possibility and, as a result, not prepare for such would leave one vulnerable and diminish the value and potential of the individual within the group. The information can also be used to develop individual and collective potential within groups.

'How to practice your religion privately while respecting the beliefs of others' might be a worthwhile seminar too, as well as 'being a loser doesn't mean everyone else is racist so stop complaining and get a job'. Some basic lessons on our legal systems, too, would be a prudent use of taxpayers' money.
A decade ago, fewer than a hundred distilleries supplied all of America’s domestic legal liquor supply. Today, we can boast four times that number. Well, “boast,” perhaps, is not wholly accurate. That growth has entailed missteps and occasional outright failures as this cohort of new distillers — who may have been hobbyists or working in wholly different fields five years ago — make the transition to more seasoned professionals.
When I was pregnant the fifth time, we found out we were having a boy and decided, based on lots of reading, talking to other parents, and talking to our pediatrician, not to have our new baby boy circumcised. I agonized over vaccinations – should we or shouldn’t we? The skyrocketing autism rates were scaring the crap out of me – despite the fact that our pediatrician and a lot of other people kept saying “There is no link between vaccines and autism.”

Letting go is an incredible concept to learn. I know this personally. I literally could not let go of the bed rail while in labor with my second child. I may have looked fully relaxed, but my hand was holding on to that rail for dear life. I felt that if I were to let go, the power of the contractions would physically sweep me off the bed. I was afraid. The contractions were stronger than my mind’s ability to control my body. But only when I was able to consciously give up my mind’s control over my body, and let go of the bed rail, then I was able to move forward in my labor and bring something new into my life. In life it can be the same. Only when we release our attempts to control what is not ours to control, do we have the ability to move on. It took me a long time to be able to release my tight grasp of control on my life and just let it flow through God’s river that is His plan for me. Letting go of our fears, of the things we can’t change, of our past, and our plans for the future. Letting go, and letting God take over can be hard, but it is what will usher us through the transition into a new phase of life. And the end result is worth it!

I bring this up because religion and sexual identity come up in Bill Cunningham: New York. Although the topics are treated gingerly (and fleetingly), they weighed heavily for me while I was watching the film. Again and again we see how Cunningham takes pride -- one might call it excessive ego-investment -- in his outward simplicity/self-effacement/self-denial. He rejects or dismisses offers of food, paychecks, awards, recognition, again and again and again. And he talks about this endlessly, which raises red flags of the lady doth protest too much sort. It feels gratuitous.

In truth, there’s nothing special about DOOMSDAY that makes me hate you for not liking it, but for me, it hits enough notes that it makes for a good, solid, post-apocalyptic action film. I just bought the Blu ray out of the $8 bin (actually, the $7.88 bin) at Walmart and it’s a slick watch. DOOMSDAY moves fast, hits hard, looks great, and it has Rhona Mitra kicking ass. It doesn’t have the style or narrative strength of something like 28 Days Later, but if you like these post-apocalypse stories like I do, DOOMSDAY delivers.
Remember, you still have until SUNDAY to turn in your dioramas, and mine are not eligible for prizes*, because even that is a bit too narcissistic for me. Imagine how hilarious that would be though, if I made contests for you guys and declared myself the winner every time.

Modern medical research has arrived at many partial answers that go part way to a complete answer. For example, three factors make stress more severe: repetition, unpredictability and lack of control.

Ais Kacang, Restoran Kek Seng – a very unusual ais kacang. It was served on a plate instead of a bowl. The homemade durian ice cream on the top was the main attraction because it came highly recommended by Carol. Though I’m not a durian fan, I tried it anyway because I’m a curious eater :3 The durian taste was actually not that strong. I like the soft and light texture which melted very fast in the mouth. I suggest ordering this after meal. Otherwise, when the shaved ice and ice cream start to melt, it’ll make the whole thing looks like a flooded region.

For the past years, I’ve stumbled upon different reading materials. Some are written just recently. Some however, are dated back years ago. I don’t wish to have been able to be a follower of that reading back when it all started, when it was still in its active high state. All I could do now is just read it, and allow it to enhance the neurons in my brain and positively brush some thoughts in it.

However, there is one (generic) process that can read the log files – and that’s ANY process that has to handle data blocks. And that’s really why I wrote this note in the first place. If a process finds at any time that the buffer it’s looking at in memory is corrupt it may do real-time block recovery if it thinks the corruption has occurred between the moment the block was read from disk and the present. There are various flags and details in the buffer header that tell it that the block is dirty (differs from what’s on disk) and the redo block address (RBA) where the earliest known change to the in-memory block can be found in the log files.

This feels like a year of change – I wonder just how much effort I will manage to put into it. Number 2 son is thinking of moving to Newcastle, number 1 grandson might join the army and I might lose weight. Of course there are modicums of other things that need planting or pruning in my life to make it completely productive and create serenity in my old age…oh but I am tired. I feel about 75 today.

A good deal of todays activity has centred around how I want to move forward with my photography. Mostly to do with how I want and need to improve my technique, how I should (re-)organise my archive so I can find images from past shoots easily and efficiently, and how I will need to take steps to promote myself a little more effectively than I've been doing up to now.
I’m hoping for Hope or Nancy to go home tonight… however, we could have a ‘scare’ if one of the frontrunners doesnt get enough support.
I recently had a client suggest that I write a blog post about Facebook. It was a reasonable suggestion given that it so frequently comes up with my clients. I spent some time mulling over what I wanted to say. I thought about how some people share things on Facebook that they’d never share so openly in similar face-to-face situations. I mean, would you really get up in front of 75 or 120 or 338 friends and say some of the things you’ve said on Facebook?

It tells me that that I'm disorganized and that I don't measure up to other women my age. It tells me that I'm a sinner unworthy to stand before God.
Doesn't that look so much cuter?
I was bribbing them both with suckers from the bank teller who had doted on them a few moments ago when they were darling angels. Now they were past humoring my To-Do list. We were on sucker number 2 and I was praying that the sugary balls of goodness would hold out, but I was ill prepared for the jam packed isles. I ran out of suckers and my once angelic daughter began tantruming (I swear I am a better mom than this sounds!) …but she began whinning at a glass-shattering high pitch and began yelling, “Mommy! Fucker, Fucker, Fucker!!! (Meaning I want a sucker of course – duh!) but yeah – I’d never said the “F” bomb in her life but here she was yelling it at the top of her lungs. Together her sister tried to imitate her by pounding her fists on the shopping cart and yelling nonsense while my oldest kept her mantra of the “F” bomb going. I was fresh out of those sticky sticks of silence and so I was “SOL”.

Once again, we grabbed the keys to our room and pilfered the complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits, (Are you seeing a pattern here?), and then made our way downstairs to set up, grab a beer and write the set. It was at this point that the cheery, portly manager made his way over to our table and stated that tonight, the room had a few birthdays in and could we cater for them. Of course, this is the staple diet of function bands and we were eager to please.

The mass media themselves also provide “experts” who regularly echo the official view. John Barron and Claire Sterling are household names as authorities on the KGB and terrorism because the Reader’s Digest has funded, published, and publicized their work; the Soviet defector Arkady Shevchenko became an expert on Soviet arms and intelligence because Time, ABC-TV, and the New York Times chose to feature him (despite his badly tarnished credentials). By giving these purveyors of the preferred view a great deal of exposure, the media confer status and make them the obvious candidates for opinion and analysis.
Yeah right.
Naomi lays the credit for her affliction squarely at the feet of the Lord. He has afflicted her (1:21). This is both true and false: False from the standpoint that her choices led to her consequences…and true from the standpoint that God is sovereign and is faithful to fulfill His plan. In fact…He is too GOOD and so FAITHFUL…that He will even ordain suffering/chastisement to bring us to our knees and turn us back to Him.

I worked with a doctor named Nitesh. A medical student in Florida who will soon be starting his residency in Alabama, Dr. Nitesh is a nice guy who generously made a point of giving cookies to the Peruvian kids who came to see us. Despite this kindness, he did not seem to mind that the English-Spanish language barrier meant I was the one who had to express sympathy and support to the patients who were having the most difficulty in their lives. If we had been in Lethal Weapon, Nitesh definitely would have been the hard-nosed Danny Glover character.

I was surprised that the brewery was worth less than 25,000 quid, including all the brewing kit. Why then was it first put on auction with a reserve price of £50,000? Were they being cheeky, or was this valuation unrealistically low? As we'll discover later, the brewery was eventually sold for more than the valuation. So I'd say £23,769 is definitely on the low side.

I work Java on a few things. Then its time to set up for class. The class starts. Im not controlling Miley circling at all. I want it to be her choice that she stops this. Oh, I forgot to tell you this. Yesterday I took a lesson from Meagan. It was at someone's house and only a couple of dogs. Miley only circled one time. WhooHoo , I was so excited. Now back to class. It was our turn to run. There was a dogwalk, tunnel discrimination and Miley took the wrong one. So I brought her back to try again and circling started. It lasted at least 3 minutes. I just stood there waiting her out( feeling bad about wasting every ones time). She just kept circling with no change is speed. It felt like forever. She has never lasted this long without stopping. She finally stops. Im not sure how to reward. Give her treats or start running agility again. I chose to run. Then she jumps the DW contact. I stop. She circles. But this time it lasted about 1/2 the time then the first circling event. I did reward with food this time. People commented that they have never seen her do this. They probably just hadnt seen it to this extent. I normally would have called her to my side to break the circling so thats why they didnt realize how big a problem this is for me. But she needs to chose not to do this without me calling her.

American-style wedding cakes are also becoming more popular in France. The traditional cake here is a huge "piece montée" of cream puffs in a pyramid covered in caramel. Macaron pyramids are also pretty common here. The New York wedding had an ice cream bar in addition to the cake. I've seen dessert buffets in both countries, obviously dessert is important no matter where you are! Cakes in France, be it for birthday, wedding, or other occasion, always have these huge sparklers in them, it's like fireworks on a cake.

Style Pitfalls – This is great for characterization and realism but it draws away from one of the main focusses of the scene which is the secret. Add to that all the conversational features and this can be very difficult to pull off in that your reader’s attention may drift. The reader may not find it easy to read conversational features and may switch off too early to get into the plot. This really depends on the type of fiction you are writing and the way you want to present your character but take care not to overdo it.

Pierre and I went home for the holidays in 2002. Christmas in Florida with both of our families (his parents came down for a glorious party and the holiday itself) and New Year's... where else? In Quebec, where they feast on a traditional yule log cake and put on the most marvelous talent show in the basement until well after midnight. It was fun... and exhausting. Pierre's family was bilingual, but of course, since their first language was French, they usually only spoke English when they were talking to me directly. I experienced a crash course in conversational French. I had bought a book and studied with Pierre in my spare time in Japan, but the book in no way prepared me for immersion into the Quebecois world. That said, they were wonderful people. I simply tired of listening so hard all the time to be able to participate in the conversation, and would crash into bed each night and sleep hard until morning.

Ali Dougal looks at all genres, whether it be science fiction or romance. She looks at all books aimed at kids aged 5+ all the way to YA/Crossover books. She pointed out that VOICE is important. MASS MARKET APPEAL would be great. She is also looking for books that are GENUINELY FUNNY. Basically, she has to love the book so much, that she can champion it in-house. If a book is promising, but not to her taste, she will pass it on to a colleague who may fall in love with it. There has to be a strong sense that the author can continue to grow. Naturally, it would be great if the book has CLEAR COMMERCIAL APPEAL. The BONUS would be if the book has international appeal and can be sold into 5-6 countries. This would mean that the author can earn out their advance, and Egmont could regain its investment. The icing on the cake would be if a film option or the screen rights could be sold.

Then - on Sunday, I had the DAY FROM HELL. It involved a certain new fella in my life (Buddy), and Poo. I shall leave it to your imagination - but the poor lamb (ha!) has probably eaten some teddy fur which has caused some diverse effects. But the day started off with me having a coffee in bed, brought to me by my thoughtful husband - but because just going out had tired me out, I fell to sleep sat up in bed with the coffee in my hand, which I tend to rest on my chest, and hold with my chin. That woke me up and thankfully it wasn't piping hot, but I have scolded me in the past because I fall back to sleep easily (something to do with FM and having so much medication that makes me drowsy). OH says it's almost like I've got narcolepsy (but not quite so severe).
First of all, I want to share a new scone recipe with you. One that I happen to really like. It's good for you too, which is super awesome and all. And the best part? It doesn't contain garbanzo beans...
Demonstrations are planned for his stay here in Paris this weekend although the visit is generating more of a yawn than any serious agitation.

Born October 15, 1992, Sam Twiston-Davies was still studying for AS-level exams at school in Gloucestershire, when he had his first Cheltenham Festival winner and Grand National ride as one of racing’s most accomplished amateur riders. The son of trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies and his estranged wife, Cathy, (who both rode as amateurs), Sam was successful in pony racing before starting in point-to-points in the 2008/09 season when becoming eligible at the age of 16. Within a few weeks, on December 28, 2008, he rode his first winner between the flags, taking a race at Cottenham in Cambridgeshire on Grenfell, trained by his mother. At Ludlow on February 18, 2009, he scored his first success under Rules when partnering Baby Run, owned and trained by Nigel, to victory in a hunter chase. A career that was bound to flourish gained added lift through Baby Run, for he and Sam went on to finish third in the following month’s Christie’s Foxhunter Chase at the 2009 Cheltenham Festival and later gained one of the season’s biggest prizes when teaming up for victory in the Champion Hunters’ Chase at the Punchestown Festival. They capped that in March, 2010, when returning to Cheltenham and running out easy winners of the Christie’s Foxhunter Chase. Sam then went to Aintree and partnered Hello Bud into fifth on his John Smith’s Grand National debut. He turned professional shortly afterwards. Sam has a younger brother, 17-year-old Willy, who took over on Baby Run in the 2011 Christie’s Foxhunter Chase, only to be unseated when leading at the second-last fence although he landed the John Smith’s Fox Hunters’ Chase on the horse a few weeks later. Sam partnered Hello Bud to victory in the 2010 Becher Chase over the Grand National course at Aintree in November and that same month gave Little Josh a brilliant ride to land the Grade Three Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham. He writes a weekly column in the Racing Post every Monday. John Smith’s Grand National record: 2010 Hello Bud (5th); 2011 Hello Bud (PU 29th)

A change is due however. We need to move onwards and upwards for we are becoming infatuated with the sensations the physical gives us and are loosing our own base frequency as a result. The effort to increase our frequencies back to our “norm” is gaining pace. Earth, the centre of physical excellence, the only physical planet to have inhabitants of free will to work with it, is the focal point for this change. It may be hard to believe, but this one small physical entity, along with us, is pivotal in the effort to lift the universe from the physical frequencies. That is why there is more and more of us becoming aware of our true role in the universe, to experience and evolve.

It was HIS experience with a highly repressive regime that had slowly built his inner-desperation; Police had confiscated his produce cart because he lacked a permit and beat him up when he resisted. Local officials then refused to hear his complaint. His act of desperation highlighted the public’s boiling frustration over police violence, living standards, rampant unemployment and lack of basic human rights. The protests begun that same day and then quickly spread across the entire region.

My ancestors were further from the harsh effects of the sun which others experienced near the equator, as a result we have whiter skin. People down near the equator (think Mexico, Africa, Southern Europe) were exposed to the harshest rays of the sun, and as a result over the many eons of evolution, their skin became darker to protect their skin from the sun. Now I don’t know who went which way. But, since rumor has it we all found our beginnings in Africa, I imagine that everyone started off dark and grew progressively lighter the farther away people moved away from the equator.

As with all of the paintings on my list, this one has a story. During an ad hoc tour for some friends of mine about 5 years ago, I again declared the De Kooning the finest of all paintings. I was getting expressive. I was describing the scene in 1950 -- Pollock on the verge of his Life magazine article and not yet back on the bottle, the others Ab Exers still drinking and fighting at the Cedar Tavern, Gorky already dead for two years. World War II had been over for three years, and the drama in these painters lives came only from themselves. I told my friends how De Kooning was different from his contemporaries, more restrained, classically trained. I described the lines in Excavation, how they carve into the canvas like blades into a wood block. At that moment, a familiar voice, my Thesis Advisor David Raskin, said from behind me, “And why don’t you describe this painting for my class, what is the basic premise of the piece?”
TGIF! I hope everyone is looking forward to the weekend and has some fun things planned. I was so proud of myself this week being all organized and everything...getting a large project done for the LSS, picking up the rugrats on time every day, house not in too bad of shape, food in the house, bills paid and blah blah blah. And then I realized I forgot to post today's new release at Little Miss Muffet Stamps on time. I guess I won't be widening the door frames to get my big head through after all.
Once again, we haven’t really had the kind of squad continuity to play our signature game, but as we enter the last few months of the season we do seem to be combining better. If you can’t keep the ball after fighting so hard to win it you’re asking for trouble and dehydration.
Now at that time King Ethelred, the son of Edgar, ruled over England, and was a good lord; this winter he sat in London. But in those days there was the same tongue in England as in Norway and Denmark; but the tongues changed when William the Bastard won England, for thenceforward French went current there, for he was of French kin.
Throughout the years more activites were added to the concept of the egg roll. Near the end of the 19th century children were playing "egg ball", "egg picking" (which sounds like our modern day egg hunts), "toss anc catch" and "egg croquet". Eventually it became large enough that entertainers such as bands were introduced into the festivites. For the 1933 celebration Elanor Roosevelt was first lady and introduced more games. The modern day easter egg roll race of today (using spoons) wasn't started until 1974. At one time there was a circus, petting zoo, antique cars on display, Broadway shows and giant balloons (most likely air balloons) as part of the entertainment. The egg hunt pits were introduced in 1981 at the White House.
5. The audio and video recording rules are problematic as well. Again, decisions about access should not be made by the superintendent. It's not her or his meeting. And, again, as evidenced by this particular situation and many others, the lack of school system communication makes a requirement for five days advanced recording approval untenable. Having become aware of the proposed public participation changes (no thanks to the school system) just yesterday, let's say that I'm now concerned enough that I think recording is justified so that the public can witness what transpires at the meeting on Monday. According to the rules, I won't be allowed to record because, through the school system's fault, an approval request five days in advance is impossible.

After that, William insists on bringing his father home to meet Jane over dinner. They bring home some steaks and wine, and when they come home Jane is naked behind a crate that is encasing the painting William's mother, Isabelle, sent him. They break the crate open.

She had ignited a tiny flame in me; it was that old familiar flame of desire. As I felt it flickering inside of me I welcomed it like an old friend, unseen for too long a time. As we walked the flame grew and grew. At this bitter moment, her sweet kiss had kindled a need for her. Not the need that could be satisfied by a kiss but a need to be with her, be in her and be a part of her. I felt guilty that I was feeling this need to make love to her and seek the succor of her warm delicate sexuality. But I could not help it.
I am proud of the times when my head gave up thoughts of the past and the future and allowed my heart to live in the present.
Something else I never try to hide is the fact that I have never actually bought myself anything from Boden although there have been a few pieces in the past that I have rather liked (think last years leopard print flat sandals), I normally reserve Boden (along with The White Company) for purchasing my 11 year old sons pyjamas and swimshorts. The quality is second to none and you get such a great return on the items once they are outgrown and you sell them on ebay, so after seeing lots of Bloggers rocking this seasons Boden version and even reading the treads on mumsnet and the Boden community page about this particular garment, I decided that even with a 7 week wait list (gulp) both the price (£25) and the fact I managed to decide on my purchase using a discount code (M684) at checkout which made the top a bargainous £21.25 and also saved me £4 with free p&p, a wardrobe classic such as this IS worth the wait. Also bear in mind that I will completely forget that I have bought it by the time it arrives and it will be a very pleasant surprise!

To counter this, the ConDems have recently pointed out that they have convinced certain big companies to take on more staff, mostly it seems in large supermarkets. However, these jobs tend to be menial, low paid and fairly degrading. Despite seemingly endless profits the supermarkets still pay their shop floor staff a pittance. One job is also not comparable to another. Whilst shop floor retail jobs are often the same between companies, someone who has been a manager in an IT company is unlikely to want to accept minimum wage, graveyard shift work. The government has missed the point that people don’t want jobs, they want careers. They need to know that they are headed somewhere, and that somewhere has a larger salary than where they are now.

Mal’haran felt a chill race up his spine and he recognized an otherworldly magic at work. The darkness surrounding Mal’haran changed into the land that he had claimed over a painful, grueling hundred years.

He was compelled to answer truthfully and shook his head almost humbly. That just made his blood boil even more.

My son will be 14 this year. He has been taught by his grandmother that I am barely a parent. That since I only see him every other weekend, that means that I should not have any say in anything he does and that I have no right to make him mind me when I do have him. He has been taught that if he is not a christian he cannot live in their home, forcing him to choose between the life he has always known and change. My son has aspeger’s syndrome and he does not do well with change. He wants everything to just stay the way it is. So he does not have any freedom to explore what path he wants to follow as far as religion is concerned. He has been taught that I am a joke, that I am something to laugh at because I want to be his mother so much but they took that away from me. And he has been taught that it is ok to talk mean to people so long as you make them feel bad for not being able to take a joke because after all, its only words.

If it be contended that the work of God is progressing, and that we are growing in holiness, then some perplexing questions arise which will be hard to answer. If the Church is making advances on the lines of deep spirituality—if we are a praying people, noted for our prayer habits—if our people are hungering after holiness—then let us ask, why do we now have so few mighty outpourings of the Holy Spirit on our chief churches and our principal appointments? Why is it that so few of our revivals spring from the life of the pastor, who is noted for his deep spirituality, or the life of our church? Is the Lord’s hand shortened that He cannot save? Is His ear heavy that He cannot hear? Why is it that in order to have so-called revivals, we must have outside pressure, by the reputation and sensation of some renowned evangelist? This is largely true in our larger charges and with our leading men. Why is it that the pastor is not sufficiently spiritual, holy and in communion with God, that he cannot hold his own revival services, and have large outpourings of the Holy Spirit on the Church, the community and upon himself? There can be but one solution for all this state of things. We have cultivated other things to the neglect of the work of holiness. We have permitted our minds to be preoccupied with material things in the Church. Unfortunately, whether designedly or not, we have substituted the external for the internal. We have put that which is seen to the front and shut out that which is unseen. It is all too true as to the Church, that we are much further advanced in material matters than in matters spiritual (E.M. Bounds, The Essentials of Prayer, 33).

I’ve also been progressing details around an idea I had about six years ago which I’ve been trying to get off the ground since. My ACC has agreed that we should pilot this idea to see what value it adds:
When we “make provision” – when we make plans to get into the path of temptation – it will lead to sin. I see this often in marriage counseling. When one spouse considers the marriage to be over, the other spouse will pay lip service to the idea of wanting to save the marriage, but put himself or herself in places where he or she is likely to run into a sympathetic partner. That person then proves to be a temptation to move on to a new relationship. This type of behavior is an example of “making provision for the flesh,” not “putting on the Lord Jesus Christ.”
The implications of this claim are, I guess, that Virgin (who have, as Eoin points out, secured a few NHS delivery contracts) are using these "donations" to get the support of MPs. And that it's those evil Tories again! Unfortunately, Eoin doesn't provide his source, doesn't list the MPs (anyone want to bet several are former or current Labour front-benchers) and, by using a cumulative graph, rather obscures the most interesting point - since 2010, Virgin's donations have dried up. Indeed, the big surge in gifts and freebies from Sir Richard's businesses was from 2008 to 2010, when a certain Gordon Brown was the Labour Prime Minister.

I started off by cutting my muslin into smaller squares. I cut each big square into 8 little squares which ended up being approx. 5.5"x5.5". First things first, cut off all of the finished edges and do a zigzag stitch around all 4 edges. Muslin frays so I wanted to make sure to stop them fraying too much. You want them to fray a little bit to get the shabby effect but if they fray too much, your stitching will all fall out! You want to keep the zigzag stitches as close to the edge as you can. This makes the edges look like lace (well, I think it does anyway).

Aside from the exposed exhaust, the only mechanical parts sitting out in the airflow are the clutch and brake levers. These being slab sided CNC machined alloy parts. It was reported that the team found the aero drag on the levers at top speed was enough to push the levers back and to induce some braking pressure. So they machined out a hole in the outer face of the levers, to ease the drag created at the lever tip.

I also wanted to share my opinion on the Beautyblender sponge since you do see it on picture 1 of the tutorial. I know some people received the sponge in their February Birchbox but sadly, I wasn’t one of those lucky people. After hearing so much about this amazing liquid foundation applicator, I had to get it! I used my Birchbox points (box and feedback points) to purchase this item for free! Although it is a little pricey; I received 2 sponges for $25.95 from the Birchbox website. I know Sonia Kashuk also has a foundation sponge but it’s a thicker less squishy sponge and harder to roll along the face for that airbrushed look because of the groove in the middle of the sponge. You can get the Beautyblender sponge at Ulta, Sephora and tons of other places online. Its is very easy to use (wet it and apply) and its reusable! Another great thing is that this sponge does not soak up the foundation and waste product as the disposable foam sponges do. Beautyblender also makes a cleaner to go with sponge. The only cons I can think of are that it is pretty expensive for a sponge and it does stain.

Because it described our relationship to a T.

We see Senta first as a child in pink pyjamas, watching the waves through a giant skylight; she craves her father's affection, but he is unable to deliver any and pushes off to sea, leaving her with a book of fairy tales for company. The Dutchman manifests as her imagining, her interior living, if you like, of such a fairy tale - as children do, as we all do if only we remember, casting her father one of its characters, and the Steersman too - who sings his quiet song with rapt nostalgia and falls asleep on the floor, where little Senta covers him tenderly with her duvet. The Dutchman and his ship arrive in a terrific coup-de-theatre, he in full Mr Darcy getup, while the ship wouldn't disgrace Errol Flynn's in The Sea Hawk. And Daland's eagerness to marry the stranger off to his daughter without noticing that said stranger is one of the Undead is all too convincing, because Daland is a stranger to love and values nothing but money.

In a non stick skillet over medium low heat, cook the eggplant and squash in the olive oil until soft and starting to brown, about 10 minutes, turning heat up towards the end to caramelize the vegetables. Pour into a large bowl and add peppers, snap peas, tomatoes and scallions. Add an inch of water to the skillet and bring to a bowl. Add the broccoli florets, cover and cook 2-3 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop cooking process. Add to bowl with other veggies. Remove skin from chicken and shred into bite size pieces. Discard bones and skin. Add to bowl and pour dressing over to moisten. Wonderful served over brown rice. Makes 4 dinner portions.

First I got a few library books, which explained some basic beekeeping info. We still had many questions, though, so we asked a friend for advice. He is part of a beekeeping club locally and was a wealth of info. We asked more people we knew with hives and got some conflicting information, but also a lot of local knowledge. We found out what we'd need to buy, and what we could borrow.

As a gorilla of independent means, I have not found it too hard to get humans to treat me with the same consideration they would show a member of their own species.

But I abhor unnecessary violence and would much rather solve these problems through dialogue and education. So I say to humans who want to treat their animal companions with respect: Learn from Shaggy!

"And then we moved to Lyndhurst, where my brother lives, which was also my grandma's house, so it was her garage, and we'd brew and barbecue, and after we finished brewing, we'd drink around the fire pit at night. It was just about us getting together."

If this was the only glass you purchased, you could use it for white wine, water or iced tea without looking ridiculous.

I know this post is kind of rambling , but I don't know how to fully connect all of my thoughts right now. I'm just sad. I miss Anna. I hate that someone who loved life was taken out of this life so young. Anna was very religious and loved God so there is no doubt in my mind that she is in heaven right now. But at the same time, as much as she loved God, I also know that she didn't want to die this young. She had plans for the rest of her life that she will never be able to complete. She had hopes and dreams that will now never come true.
Unfortunately, I did not have any dragons. Why not? I'm not quite sure. Every mother should have a stock of miniture dragons handy just in case of emergencies. However, what I did have was a rather cute selection of sheep, which I had knitted after, Sarah McIntyre's, Vern and Lettuce book launch. See post: Vern and Lettuce.
This quote, “Well-behaved women seldom make history” is often mis-attributed; sometimes to Eleanor Roosevelt and, oddly, even Marilyn Monroe(!?).
The voodoo that runs throughout the book is the fantasy element and a high point. From the simple mind controlling and zombies crews to the fantastical Fountain of Youth sequence, the magic is integral and not too obtrusive, for the most part. Magic is both minuscule and able to be employed by the meanest of pirates and complex, reserved for the most powerful of practitioners. As an integral part of the plot it works and I do like Powers's "rules" for magic quite a bit.

Now, I realise the subject of renewable energy is one that has been discussed so many times that even someone who has gleamed the basis of their knowledge from the news can understand that there is no easy answer; but I must also press that I myself have an understanding of the situation that could probably be written upon the back of David Cameron’s hand. Just as long as he did not already have a list of witty anecdotes for the Eurozone meetings scrawled upon it in Crayola.

There was barely time for Netley to restart the game after Ben Rowe's equalising goal. After sneaking the ball through a busy crowd of legs he was chased out of the penalty area by his team mates. He got as far as the half-way line before they caught up to offer their congratulations by wrestling him to the ground. It took two or three to knock him off balance, then he fell beneath the weight of the rest. Disappointment has been an unusual experience for Netley this season. Their players stood glued to the spot. Some of them looked down at the grass, others pointed fingers of blame at one another. It was odd to see them, a side who would have sealed the title with a win, succumbing to a last minute equaliser from a goal mouth scramble via a free-kick Kristian Hewitt admitted was far from his best. One of Netley's substitutes demanded they adopt a conservative strategy for the remainder of the game. “Keep the ball in the corners,” he screamed. There were five seconds of the match left.

When was the last time you were read a story? I don’t mean the last time you read a book but the last time you shut your eyes and were read to. This book has that feel about it. You don’t feel that you are reading, you feel like you are being told a story and that is quite an achievement. Not all readers loved this book as much as I did. Their explanations are reasonable: the meandering nature of the work got to some, the seemingly constant digressions, its peculiarly eastern take on philosophy, the open-ended conclusion – all valid points. On Goodreads when I checked there were 97 reviews and their star-ratings are across the board; the dozen one-star reviews completely floored me though. I never expected to see that.

Since the Victorians – the coiners of the terms “white meat” and “dark meat” which they used in order to avoid saying “breast” or “leg” – Christians have found it easier to guilt others, and particularly their children, into an abstinence-only approach to sexuality, rather than attempting the much more difficult but infinitely more valuable task of cultivating a robust Christian ethic of sexuality whose chief attributes are gratitude and reverence. As a result, we’re known for thinking sex is shameful.

Soundwise, this 1987 tape is classic BASF chrome. Super-bright and transparent, with an 1980s glassiness to behold. There’s some really good music on the cassette, featuring an acoustic piano and vocals, which I recorded straight to a stereo deck. Sadly, though, the record level was too high and there is some distortion. The level would have been fine for some other tapes I was using around that time, but these real CrO2s couldn’t handle high volumes. It’s all part of the nostalgic package, though. A taste of what I was doing as a youngster, 25 years ago. It really doesn’t seem any time at all. In another 25 years, assuming I’m still around, I’ll presumably be a pensioner. Life, blink of an eye, etc. Scary.

First, there were the assholes who just stop/stand in the middle of the fucking walkway. Have some self awareness, people. Others are trying to walk, and you're clogging up the arterial like the cholesterol that's going to give your fat ass a heart attack at the age of 52. My favorite, though, were the stroller-cunts walking WAY to slowly in front of me who said, and I quote, “We can just act like everyone else and stop in the middle of the rode.” I swear to you that if, for some reason, I happened to be walking with an ice pick at that particular moment, I would have jabbed it in one of their necks. Then pooped on the baby.
Maintain a GPF advisor capability; look at combining 162d BDE and the Security Assistance Training Management Office (SATMO) as proponent for GPF advisory capability. Our Special Forces remain our primary combat advisor force. But unless we decide to increase the number of SF Groups and expand SF capacity, we will need more conventional types (GPF) to execute the advisory missions that the NDS addresses. We currently have GPF advisors in a variety of areas like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Columbia. The Army is standing up regionally aligned brigades (RAB) for advisory and theater-cooperation missions in Africa beginning in 2013. The advisory mission is a less-expensive yet effective way of maintaining our presence in areas of interest around the globe. We ought to consider such duty as important as developmental positions (perhaps as important as key/ command billets) given that such duty affords one the opportunity to shape foreign military leaders and potential future national-level leaders (as a result of his previous advisor assignment, current JCS Chairman and former Program Manager for the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) modernization program, GEN Dempsey, maintains good relations with King Abdullah, the current king of Saudi Arabia and former commander of SANG).

To me it struck me as a little odd that the military would be helping in what comes off a recruitment video while Obama is publicly saying he’s going to try and slash the budget to reduce the military to what would be an anemic level. I thought that since the military brass probably had some inkling that his proposed cuts were coming then the generous level of help in this video was a not so subtle cue to Obama that it is our troops not drones and computers that make this the best fighting force in the world (but Obama would have to live in reality to realize that)…it also comes off as a bit of slap to people like Rick Santorum who think women have no place in the military and should just stay home barefoot and pregnant (I still say Santorum should try that line about women not being fit for combat to the face of any armed female member of the military and see how long he lasts).

An album has always been limited to and by technical means. I mean, when you don’t have the money to record and manufacture a 3hrs long release, you’re gonna, if you’re lucky, split it in three parts and release each part one after the other, sometimes with a decade in between each. That’s exactly what France’s Supuration have been forced to do with their “Cubic Trilogy” for example.
As the moon rose over the crimson stained battleground, both commanders were still locked in battle with one another. No one ever managed to find records for the battle.

These days, we’re in a bit of a tizzy ourselves, getting ready to commemorate the Centennial of that event — a major one by the standards of any small town and, you could argue, in the history of Florida and the nation. It was certainly a remarkable achievement, crossing mangrove swamps and open water. Crews endured hurricanes, mosquitos and the relentless humidity of the subtropics — without the modern comforts we take for granted now.

And although Daphne is excited, she’s quickly overwhelmed by all of the support and fanfare from the deaf community. As much as she wants to be, as she tells John, just a girl playing basketball, this is an event and a moment of pride for the extended family/community she is a part of. In fact, at the hotel, she learns people traveled from as far as Houston just to root Carlton on. As the star player, it’s a lot to bear on her shoulder. And then, based on an “anonymous tip”, she’s nearly disqualified for not having been a consecutive Carlton player for the past six weeks. Melody gives an impassioned speech about what it means to the community and Buckner relents to let Daphne play for Carlton.
I've never had so many people notice me. On one hand, it's a bit creepy to me that people are looking at me...on the other, people's concern (I'm hoping it's concern and not nosiness) gladdens my heart. It means someone cares, right?
Since it was past midnight when I was brought to my room, and my friend was beat, she decided to stay with me and help me out. I am so glad she did, I can't imagine being there by myself that night. The nurses came in and did their thing, and by 8am I was going to get my rear-end to NICU. I got out of bed and tried to dress and clean and all the other things you need to do after a c-section; and let's just say my friend and I are bonded for life and I can never disown her because she knows too much. And thank God for narcotics so I don't have to remember any of it vividly - just a vague recollection.

Over the past year, Rigby has gotten so much better about trying different foods. And one thing that she's started doing is going through cook book and cooking magazines marking recipes she would try. Her system is pretty simple, if it looks good in a picture, she'll read the ingredients and then decide if it's something she would try. She saw this recipe in Cuisine at Home, and thought it was something she might like. So I made it. She wasn't a fan of the cauliflower, mainly because of the leeks. She also has a firm belief fruit should not be cooked, ever. I personally loved the combination of cauliflower, apple, and leek. I also liked the fact the entire combination was roasted in the oven. Overall, not a bad dish. As I sit here typing this, I'm not certain of hubby's take on the dish as his portion is in the fridge covered in foil, waiting for him...

I don’t know why I didn’t blast him. I couldn’t. I just see him as flawed. He did love me. I know he did. And he probably did most of what he did because he was weak. I have a soft spot for weak. My husband was weak too. I always made excuses for him.
In a limited sense, I am a conservative: I am quite willing to conserve what is good and I am against changing things without justification. This is, of course, a reasonable position: to infer that past idea, morals and values are incorrect simply because they are old is just as fallacious as assuming that they are correct just because they are old. The age of such things, at least by itself, has no bearing on their goodness or badness. As might be imagined, being a conservative in this sense is not what people usually think of when they think of what it is to be a conservative. After all, someone who thinks that something should be conserved on the basis of rational arguments for its goodness just seems to be, well, rational. As such, a mere willingness to conserve what is both old and good does not seem to be enough to count as a social conservative. The question is, of course, what more is needed.

Earlier, in response to the initial accusations of superficiality, John had pointed to the frequent apocalyptic references in the novel: it begins with Andy remembering seeing the eclipse of the sun at the age of fifteen, and Dag is fascinated by the nuclear test sites in Nevada and brings back from there melted sand which terrifies Claire in case it's still radioactive. Their dreams and stories are full of death and nuclear annihilation. Towards the end Andy sees the smoke from farmers burning their fields and thinks it's the fulfilment of his nightmare, a nuclear cloud. Trevor now spoke up at last and said with a great air of reason and calm, which at long last made people shut up and stop interrupting, that in his opinion this book, far from being superficial, was about very serious, important and current matters: the ruination of the world and the wastage of the lives of future generations through environmental pollution, financial collapse and nuclear threat.

The flick effortlessly globe-hops and time jumps so that we may see how Largo, the infant adopted from the orphanage, grew into Largo, the smart, self-assured billionaire who is good with a knife, his fists and the ladies. Ostensibly an origin flick, THE HEIR APPARENT never bores, even with all its talk of financial intrigue, takeovers and double (triple?) crosses. You can tell there's more to the backstory, but director/co-screenwriter Jerome Salle wisely keeps things moving at a rapid pace (it clocks in at an easy-to-digest 108 minutes) and I never felt the flick dragging.

I have lost hearing in my left ear yet can always "hear" music that other people can't, like in a loud restaurant or music coming from somewhere far away. Moses has a deep love for music, as soon as he hears it, he comes whipping around the corner to find where it is coming from, or when I am singing to him, or Chris is playing his guitar, he just stops and stares at us. he loves it so much, and to see someone so little and young respond to something he loves is just the most magical thing. Vae has that same love for flipping off of things. :)

Luke 22:41-46 describes this time, and says that Jesus prayed that “this cup be taken from me.” This phrase might be interpreted to mean that Jesus would like to not have to go through the upcoming torture and death. It may, however, refer to the fact that the physical pain he was suffering was going to kill him too soon, before he could die on the cross. The idea of Jesus praying for strength to continue parallels with Heb. 5:7-8, which says that he cried out to God to be saved from death and that he “learned obedience to the Father.”

The staff watched the scene before them in fascination. The DeLong’s often hosted dinner parties, and once in a while, had others over for a “couple’s party”, but never anything to this extent. Cocks swelled, pussies grew wet, and with raised eyebrows and exchanged looks, the staff sent the message that they planned on partaking of each other in the same fashion once the night was over.
This isn't even the first time that this has happened either. The first time this happened was about three months after I got it, the screen started to flicker like crazy. Dells support was no help in the matter. They told me that I had the wrong type of charger. Idiots, completely fools who only read off of scripts and don't really handle your problems. I finally made them send over a support agent to fix it after yelling enough, they told me I was right and that the screen was completely busted, they replaced it on the spot. It then happened a second time, only it was temporary, and like an idiot I ignored it. That was about five months ago. Now we are at this point where its been four days, this is not going away. I now have to sink my own money into repairing it. If it was a desktop, I would be ok with it. It's easier and cheaper to get parts. But not with a laptop that was incredibly expensive to get at the time.
College stations started to pick it up as well, but before long, mothers started picketing the stations, trying to get the song banned because of the lyric, "He just wants to pop my cherry." The song received airplay in Austin as well, on the local KLBJ. In fact, Lady Bird Johnson was listening one time and called the station demanding they never play the song again. Eventually they went in the studio to record over the one line to make it more suitable for radio, though the censored version was never released as a single.
