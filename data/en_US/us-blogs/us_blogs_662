Upon receiving the parcel (I'm not really sure which day it came in as I was out of the country for work), I already couldn't keep my hands away from the body frosting as well as the really lovely scented hand sanitizer. Just a sneak preview over here, the hand sanitizer is sooooooooooooooo moisturizing...OMG..
Next month, we'll be back to the Coney as usual.
I have put up the deliberately restrained poem Mentalist, of which Sabotage said:
One reason Americans are so extremely terrified about child abductions is that whenever we turn on the TV or computer, there’s another one. As if these horrific crimes are happening 24/7, when actually the media is only too happy to fly across the country — or world — to set up camp wherever a cute, white girl has disappeared. Tight news budgets get thrown out the window for a story like this. But because that story then shows up on our screen at home, it feels like it’s happening right around the corner. All the time.
Transgender children should be sterilized before puberty so they can better conform to sex roles.
﻿ I love going places with my boys, I really do. What I don't like is how fast they move through everything. This time I really tried to grab their attention and make them stop and really see what was there. Eli, my oldest, was more apt to stop and take note. The others just zoomed. Luckily the Ecotarium is small enough where they could zoom and I could still keep track of them with only a small number of patrons knowing the names of my children. Our favorite was the curator's exhibit where they could touch and hold shark's teeth, porcupine quills, skulls, huge pine cones, snakeskin and so much more.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil. Add the potatoes to the skillet in one layer and let them cook for a few minutes until they start to brown on one side. Add the onion and the spices. Flip the potatoes so they brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.
I write this to you, who are weary of prayer. To you, who used to believe in the power of prayer and now are not so sure. To you, who believe in God, but are frustrated with how you pray and seem to feel as though God has forgotten you. To you dear friend, I write. God has not forgotten you. I am a witness of that! I can stand before you today and say,"God has heard my prayers! God has lifted my head to look up and see how the impossible is possible!" To you my friend, I say PRAY. Pray to our great God who loves you, has purpose in all things, has a reason for your trial, has understanding where you lack, has victory when it feels hopeless. For it is when you pray... that one day you will be able to shout, "BREAKTHROUGH!"

Now you might have been forgiven for thinking the ladies were just having a bit of fun at the expense of a gullible wee lad and when she learns of it his grandmother dismisses what he had been told as nothing more than “an old wifie’s tale … there’s no truth in those tales.” Truth is not the only reason to listen to tales being told though. Many years later, on a return visit to South Uist, Thomson runs into an eighteen-year-old girl who he had encountered on his first trip there. Like the majority of her generation she dreams of moving to the mainland – in her case to go into service – and she can’t understand Thomson’s interest in all the old stories:
As far as I'm concerned, the most overrated beers are the ones you have to buy on Ebay for more than $100. And I applaud brewers like Vinnie Cilurzo for limiting the Pliny release to pints only: no growlers.
On the subject of the Old Fashioned, I know what I'm about to say is blasphemy, but whiskey and Sprite, with a few dashes of bitters, is a reasonably authentic shortcut for an Old Fashioned. The only really inauthentic thing is the carbonation. After all, the drink is whiskey, water, bitters, sugar, and citrus. To keep it, again, reasonably authentic, you have to use a light hand with the soda. A ratio of about one-to-one seems to work pretty well, and I'm also generous with the bitters.
Eventually we found ourselves on the subway heading towards the MoMA. Three of us were suffering slightly and had to grab a coffee and pretzel to help deal with our headaches. Once inside the museum it didn’t take long for us all to be separated; each of us moving at our own pace enjoying some works more than the others. I particularly enjoyed the Pop-Art galleries, having been a fan of the likes of Keith Harring and Roy Lichtenstein.
The Tennessean did not choose to run the strip and allow it to foster debate about this question or questions of abortion, politics, or the ethics of forced ultrasound. Instead, The Tennessean decided it was important to protect print readers from being exposed to medical terminology and a real rights issue facing women who choose to terminate pregnancies. When our local newspaper is deciding that its readers can’t handle the subject of a national debate, concerning itself more perhaps with advertisers sharing space with even slightly provocative content, and determining that “slut” is okay but “transvaginal” is not, it simply reinforces the perception that real Tennesseans are not being served by the newspaper sharing their name.

Where it all falls down is that, having convinced him of her submissiveness, she should poison his pasta or slip a stiletto between his ribs, but by then she has discovered she is sexually attracted to him. Hmn, is this battered wife syndrome? No, it's a comedy. They all end in marriage and Caterina and Petruchio are as subject to the life force as any Shavian characters. When you look at the best Padua and Pisa have to offer - Gremio, Lucentio, Hortensio - drips, fops, old men, Petruchio at least begins to look like an interesting husband, especially once you've twigged what he was doing in his "courtship" and behaviour as a groom.

I've used a base of Aqua bazzill and layered with white (pierced), yellow bazzill and some Sidewalks DP. The vertical panel is white punched with the Deco Fan punch and topped with more Sidewalks DP. The Zinnias have been stamped in Memento Tuxedo Black onto X-press It Blending Card and coloured with Copics (Y21, Y35, Y38, YG11, YG13, YG17, B21, B23, B26, C1, C3, 0). It's been cut out with Large Circle Nestabilities and matted with the coordinating Lacey Circles. The sentiment is also from Zinnias and has been cut out with Ribbon Tags Trio and attached with some aqua looped ribbon. To finish I've added a few yellow pearls to the top corner.

I totally agreed. Some whites, in black company, beset by the contradiction between long-learned racism and the demands of courtesy, confusedly offend listening blacks. The stereotypical "Some of my best friends..." and other awkward attempts at what they think to be civility, elicit from black people an outburst of anger whites can neither comprehend nor avoid. Was this not exactly the kind of information Angelou was demanding of her fan? Perhaps she was simply trying to show up this woman's apparently surface-level commitment, but surely there is a better way. If anyone can explain this apparent contradiction, I would certainly like to hear it.

Just beyond scenic Charlottesville, but before you hit Waynesboro, is the Blue Mountain Brewery. Home to such acclaimed beers as Full Nelson Pale Ale and Dark Hollow, Blue Mountain is set in some of the most picturesque landscape of Virginia's countryside. It's comfortable and cozy, like an old country home, only with everything brand new and a brewery attached. Inside is a classy stone fireplace, several wooden tables and a sleek bar setup that has a backing glass window featuring the fermentation tanks in the brewing area.

The ladder of the knowledge of God, in other words, only goes one way. We can only know God as God has revealed Himself to us, and we can never determine who God is by our own means and definitions. We cannot take from any earthly definition and move ‘upward’ toward God; all our understandings of God must be received, downward, from Him in revelation. But this is precisely where the good news begins, because this is exactly what God has done. He, recognizing the gap between our knowledge and Him, has made a way for us to know Him. Humanity could not reach God, but God condescended to reach humanity.

The John Terry / Anton Ferdinand issue is continuing to make headlines and take up a lot of radio time. The issue is that Terry allegedly called Ferdinand a ‘fucking black cunt’ and as a result the football and sporting world is up in arms. I cannot imagine that this is the first time that Ferdinand has been called this, or something similar but I do not wish to condone or excuse Terry for what is, grossly unacceptable behaviour.
As a follow-up of the previous Siouxsie show in Milano, here is the 1984 appearance. By then the band was not a cult band playing small clubs but ready to play the bigger venues and the Teatro Tenda was the venue a band of a certain status used to play in town. The recording is very very good indeed, despite being a recording from nearly 30 years ago. To my point of view by 1985 the band stopped to be innovative and started to be a bit repetitive, so I guess this is somehow their peak. Enjoy! -ldb
So let me try to come back around to my point, if indeed there is one. I have always lived, still live, and will continue to live in a world where I am more privileged and wealthy than almost everyone else in the world. How am I to live globally, not focusing on the affluence of the people around me, but on the stark, endless poverty that so much of the world lives in? In two months, when the cameras have left Haiti and the cruise ships return guilt-free, will I still care about the people who live there?

Gay people have different emotional reactions to the “F” word. Some find it as horrific as the “N” word; others use it themselves with their friends. I’ve heard youngsters use the “F” word and defend its use as NOT meaning gay but just something negative like “that movie was so faggy.”**

“If at all relevant times, Rupert Murdoch did not take steps to become fully informed about phone-hacking, he turned a blind eye and exhibited wilful blindess to what was going on in his companies and publications. This culture, we consider, permeated from the top throughout the organisation and speaks volumes about the lack of effective corporate governance at News Corporation and News International. We conclude therefore that Rupert Murdoch is not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company”.

Kim Hyun-sung (Jang Hyun-sung), a hard-boiled fund manager, spends an evening of heavy drinking with his co-workers at a restaurant. A colleague shows up with some airsoft rifles, and soon all of them are pointing their weapons every which way and firing them in the busy restaurant. The server asks the guests to put the firearms away, and Hyun-sung ends up getting into a brawl with the waiter. The next day, following a probe into the company’s financial dealings and the suicide of one of his associates, Kim flees to the wooded retreat of one of his friends, hoping to recover his equilibrium. Instead, his buddy convinces him to take part in a war game with some friends. This vigorous if not wholly original exploration of the ruthlessness of business culture firmly embraces the dogme esthetic, the camera crew and boom mike being plainly visible in one restaurant scene.

If you find a Fleetwoods album, buy it. Every song they ever made is wonderful. Most people only know their two #1 hits, Mr. Blue and Come Softly To Me, both from 1959. Their first hit, Come Softly To Me, was an international success as well, reaching #1 in Canada, #6 in England, and #4 in Australia. The song was immediately covered in England by Frankie Vaughan With The Kaye Sisters, but the British audience still preferred the original version. Their version only peaked at #9 on the British charts. Strangely, none of the records by The Fleetwoods ever made the airplay or sales charts in Germany. The Fleetwoods placed nine other records on the Billboard Hot 100, with the biggest hit being Tragedy at #10 from 1961. They also placed four songs in Billboard's Bubbling Under The Hot 100. Go find them all on YouTube and you'll wonder why they didn't have a lot more top ten hits.

‘I began to wonder, as I saw a crop of self poisoners every day, whether a hefty fine would not be more appropriate than empathy and false promises of help to come. This was certainly the view of the casualty department staff, who washed out the stomachs of the overdosers not so much for medical reasons, but in the vindictive hope that so unpleasant a procedure would discourage them from repeating their action (it was a vain hope). Once a young girl, well-known to the hospital for her repeated overdoses, swallowed the contents of a bottle of mild analgesic, which she assumed was harmless because it was so widely available without prescription. But she had miscalculated, blood tests showed that she had irreparably damaged her liver. It was not without a certain exultation that she was informed of her unavoidable and imminent death (she was still conscious).’

Harsh maybe, but I see his point. during NaNoWriMo I spent the larger portion of my time writing. I would occasionally go to the webpage, and look around, and pop in on the Facebook page. I met some really cool friends during NaNo. Some people would share what they had just written. I’m hesitant to do that, as my first draft is essentially getting the bones down. I shared a couple of scenes, but not many. The following is one of the few scenes I”ve shared. This is the first kiss scene from Kiss Of The Dragon, copyright 2012 by Ellie Mack, my current WIP. This was not the first draft, but the revised text.

Schneiderman’s lawsuit says that the Delaware River Basin Commission should not be adopting regulations to permit fracking before the federal government has complied with the National Environmental Policy Act by first doing an environmental assessment of the effects of fracking. The United State’s is a signatory to the DRBC’s creation, the Army Corps of Engineers is on its board and the DRBC can be considered a form of quasi federal agency, all reason why a federal environmental impact statement would be required. In fact, the DRBC used to do them. New York is on the board, which is one reason a New York State environmental impact statement should be required under SEQRA (the State Environmental Quality Review Act, sometimes known as “Little NEPA.”) Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey have never passed this kind of law requiring assessment of environmental effects before taking actions affecting the environment.

One reviewer said that the film’s harshest critics are from the extreme ends of the spectrum. For those at the far end of evangelical fervor, the film will not be Christian enough. For the “freedom from religion” crowd, it will be too Christian. I don’t care about any of that. What I care about, what I want more than anything else – and what I want from every film I see – is nothing more than a good story, well-executed. By “well-executed” I don’t mean a film with a big budget, lots of things exploding, heavy artillery and stellar special effects. All of those things can cover a multitude of theatrical sins. Is the acting good? Is the story and dialogue believable? Are the characters interesting? Does the story make me care about what happens to them?

There’s a bitter irony here. The fiscal crisis in Wisconsin, as in other states, was largely caused by the increasing power of America’s oligarchy. After all, it was superwealthy players, not the general public, who pushed for financial deregulation and thereby set the stage for the economic crisis of 2008-9, a crisis whose aftermath is the main reason for the current budget crunch. And now the political right is trying to exploit that very crisis, using it to remove one of the few remaining checks on oligarchic influence.

Do men like romance heroes exist in real life? Some may argue no. Some of my happily-married and -coupled friends may beg to differ. But does it matter? A big part of romance is escapism. Fantasy. But readers can still learn from this. I'm not saying any of us should hold out for the perfect man, but we shouldn't settle, either. And really, most romance heroes aren't perfect (really, I have no patience for the ones who are). Just like the heroines, though, they learn.

For then, despite the fact that the people are still paying for the debt of the dollars it took for the government corporation to build that public asset (bridges, roads, buildings, etc.), it then sells that asset to private sector corporations for pennies on the dollar, and allows private sector corporations like Morgan Stanley to charge you the people such things as parking meter fees, parking garage and expressway fees, bridge tolls, and other profitable fees and collections for the infrastructure our fathers built with taxpayer money. And then the government uses that revenue generated by the sale of publicly funded infrastructure to buy or build even more public infrastructure, charging the debt to the people and retaining the asset (wealth), only to turn around later and sell the new asset for more dollars to build more infrastructure and accumulate more indebtedness for the people.
This past weekend we got a few estimates on our windows. One from Home Depot and another one from an independent window company. Home Depot quoted us using "Simonton Windows" which are the ones you see in the above picture. They have various styles, but I really like the "double hung" grid windows that seem to lend to the original look of our home. These of course are "vinyl windows," which are much cheaper than the "wood ones." There are also other types of "double hung" windows - like in the first picture above. That one just has grids on the top half of the "double hung" windows.

my c-section recover has been amazing. adam is nearly 5 weeks old and i feel like i'm back to my old self. my body is another story though... i am 9lbs away from my pre-pregnancy weight but still way high for what my usual norm is. damn fertility drugs! i've also got a belly and a "shelf" right above the incision and i'm anxious to work this off. so i've got my work cut out for me over the summer. i'd like to lose about 40lbs total.

I went straight to bed as if on autopilot. The crying had calmed me somewhat. I felt exhausted.
2 Timothy 1:7:
My favorite verse in the Bible brings this home…..
Jesus loves you just as you are, but He loves you too much to want you to stay that way. His will is for you to move beyond passively believing in Him but not really changing, to actively living for Him in ways that will change your life significantly. Here’s how you can do that:

I think multiculturalism and immigration is the real reason why people no longer recognise their Country and they blame the politicians for it but there is no political alternative because the ruling political class are perceived as one and the same.

I did a quick web search for my pen name. There were no writers by that name. I googled it and found someone has grabbed a website for it and her daddy is building her a website. She is also all over the social networking sites. That doesn’t mean that I can’t use it but it does mean that both of us would come up if we did a search for the name. But more importantly we both wouldn’t come up if someone searched for my books under my pen name.
19. Art: You can buy expensive art programs, but there is so much for free on the internet these days that unless there is a specific need you cannot get met in some other way, I would avoid purchasing large amounts of materials concerning art. There are numerous sites that showcase art projects for the very young, and others that walk you through the complexities of drawing faces. With young students especially, I think it is most important that they grow to enjoy and appreciate art...both doing it and looking at it.

We previously reported that the methanol extract of Ashwagandha (roots of Dunal) induced dendrite extension in a human neuroblastoma cell line. In this study, we found that six of the 18 compounds isolated from the methanol extract enhanced neurite outgrowth in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Double immunostaining was performed in rat cortical neurons using antibodies to phosphorylated NF-H as an axonal marker, and to MAP2 as a dendritic marker. In withanolide A-treated cells, the length of NF-H-positive processes was significantly increased compared with vehicle-treated cells, whereas, the length of MAP2-positive processes was increased by withanosides IV and VI. These results suggest that axons are predominantly extended by withanolide A, and dendrites by withanosides IV and VI. Copyright 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins

The units were moved to police stations to be closer to the public, he said, but this had not been making an impact. Many aspects had to be looked at in terms of human and material resources before a unit could be relaunched, he added.
For all you gallerists out there: Don’t run your website through Artnet. It loads incredibly slowly, and involves navigating through a lot of superfluous pages. It’s better to have your own website and make it simple without a lot of useless flash animation. When I go to a gallery site, I want two things and I want them fast: Contact info and images of the artists’ work. I don’t have time to be impressed by your webmaster’s tricks or the fact that you have enough money to waste it on being a part of artnet.
Q. What are your future plans?
So this is what I do, I start making the lamb/goat the Indian way, I fry the masalas and add the meat and let them fry together for half an hour to one hour, depending on my patience, throw in some potatoes and once when the meat looks like it has sucked in the flavours from the spices, rather that putting them in the pressure cooker, I put the whole thing in the oven and leave it for 3 to 4 hours (again depending on the time I have in hand). The result is the most awesome lamb, the meat is so soft that the meat literally falls off the bone, the gravy is rich and spicy and the potatoes are to die for. Throughout the Christmas socialization period I have been making this and my guests all love it!
So simply wanting to check-in here and wish you and yours a year filled with growth, joy, fulfillment and warmth.

I look over my shoulder at the much smaller college girl running behind me in her intimidating teeny, tiny sorority shorts. And instead of comparing myself like us women often do, I smile. Cause that little figure trotting behind me has yet to even dream of the miracles that my baby birthing figure has housed...

I read The (London) Times daily, including on Sunday. I especially keep an eye out for Op-Eds by Daniel Finkelstein, Janice Turner, David Aaronovitch, Philip Collins and Dominic Lawson. I always read Andrew Sullivan’s column and Camilla Long’s interviews, and Isabel Oakeshott’s lengthy In Focus reports.
The hatred of tobacco products and their consumers is dangerous to social stability, unfounded and unjust, based on paranoia and hysteria, propped up by the millions of pounds and dollars paid to their chief activisits, and pollsters, and its dangerous to the ecomony.

Today was a great ride. Same arena, but the middle of the day instead of dusk with all the horse eating shadows. I set up a grid, barrels, one stride to a vertical, one stride to a second vertical, 2 strides to barrels. I'd say the verticals were about 2'3, a little higher than the barrels. The first time we fleeeeeewwww through it and did the 2 strides in one. I second guessed myself... was that really a long one stride? I thought I measured 30'. So we did it backwards and lo and behold, it was two. I discovered something really important today. Jasper responds to half halts between jumps. I never even tried before because I totally assumed he'd be oblivious to them. We jumped the grid both ways, first from a trot and then from an easy canter. Our last time through we landed over the last vertical, I gave a half halt and a "whoa!" and got a nice 2 tot he barrels. He was balanced enough after barrels that he was able to stop easily and smoothly and I jumped off and gave him lots of praise. Good 'nuff...!
With low wooden stools at the bar, there’s leather sofas with faded Union Jacks printed on overlooking the high street and nestled between big indoor potted plants. A simple singular tall table is at the other end of the bar next to the almost floor to ceiling windows, followed by a row of stools at a wall mounted side. Well known lounge music set the mood to chilled setting, with candles flickering against maroon coloured walls. Surprisingly, the colour scheme goes well with the tiled floors and red brick bar, as does the back bar itself.
So Twilight Sparkle is discovering more about her magical powers. Spike enjoys the moustache trick, of course – brilliant move on the part of the writers. Twilight’s fragile mood is shattered when the Great and Powerful Trixie comes to town. While Twilight is a humble student of magic, the Great and Powerful Trixie is a showboater who seems more eager to gain approval as the “best pony in Equestria” than to use her magic for any positive use. Already there’s a contrast between Twilight’s magic (self-manifesting, useful, social) and The Great and Powerful Trixie’s (contorts existing material, unhelpful, anti-social).
I know I have been a bad blogger lately, but I have not been in the crafting mood. Really. I did some stick pins last week and this layout was started on Friday and now is when I finished it. I have not wanted to finish it at all.

Good Morning! Here are a few items of interest from our morning paddle through the news:
trials.
I attended my first CNL workshop back in 2009 and found it a most friendly gathering of storytellers and story-based practitioners all willing to share their stories and ideas in an informal but hugely productive and inspiring event. I will be attending the Todayand Tomorrow event and I also highly recommend the Exploring the Mythical Field event (which unfortunately I can’t make) if you are at all interested in myth, archetypes and constellations.

because in their typical African arrogance they thought it could never happen to them. They felt hurt and insulted by their brother for equating the Marxist-Leninist ANC "democracy" with Tyranny, while tens of thousands of people in the Marxist-Leninist run New SA had been murdered since 1994. This IS a tyranny!. The Marxist-Leninist ANC Regime has stood back for almost two decades while their cadres continued murdering tens of thousands of people, as they had done during the Apartheid years. They thought everyone would just sit back and allow this anarchy to continue, as in the rest of this corrupt cursed
This weekend I had the privilege to spend some time with my family and I must confess it felt great to be together, to share and laugh. I am thankful for the moments we spent and for the memories we shared. Sometimes in our busy schedules and independent lifestyles we forget about family, but believe me, family time and gatherings are extremely important! Find time for your family, try to keep in touch and always remember they are a little part of you. Keep them close and love them as your most precious treasure.

Okay, in honor of the season - the Halloween season, that is - I thought you would appreciate a look at a little something from a horror movie.
This morning I arose fairly easily at 4:50am to go run. Sounds crazy even to myself who enjoys this kind of stuff. Having a couple crazy friends, Eugene and Dan, for company helps motivation. I always have to remind myself how good I feel seeing the sunrise over the Organ Mountains, the brisk cool air before the heat of the desert has a chance to torch the land and creatures and a personal sense of accomplishment well before most folks are heading to work or even waking up.

This was one of the harder dinner and a movie themes. So, I basically had to go with how I like to deal. Brinner! Plus, "brinner" was coined on Scrubs, a show Mandy guest starred in while she was dating Zach Braff. 2-fer! Haha.
When the Acadians were cast from their home in Nova scotia by the dreadful British, and made their way to Louisiana, they made friends with the local Indians and Creoles from New Orleans. The Creoles had been brought to New Orleans from haiti as slaves, and gumbo was their native dish. The Creoles taught the Cajuns how to make their staple soup, gumbo, and the Indians taught the Cajuns how to use the lush and bountiful Louisiana flora and fauna to create delicious dishes."

My reasoning is: Hell, if I'm spending so much time and energy trying to catch up with the latest in art-house theatrical releases, why not go all the way and take in the latest art-house revivals as well? Even with stuff that is technically available on DVD (though admittedly, The Prowler is not)? That's the way the directors intended for their films to be seen anyway, am I right?
At that point a car came along. The driver saw them and realised that these two children shouldn’t be out alone so stopped, got out of his car, and stopped them. I called out to him that I was their mother and run up to them.
Then, it was my turn! I got an I Am Nancy poster which I asked her to sign with her line, “I’m into survival!” and took out the surprise to show her: my St. Auggies’ sweater. Her face seeing it was priceless! She asked me if I wanted her to sign it, but I demurred because I actually wear it! I’m afraid of losing her signature in the wash! I know, I know...that’s supremely geeky of me. I embrace it. It’s a really comfy sweater!

And people wonder why they get murdered.
I knew there would be someone there to ask me if I was Muslim, etc, checking I was not some European tourist trying to lie her way out of walking to the tourist entrance. I had of course by this point put on my hijab and long sleeves, but nevertheless expected a man there expecting me to say “Assalamu 3alaykom” or something of the like.

It was 1983 in Tucson, and my best friends were Jeff Farr, Lenny Friedman, and Laurie Steelink. Jeff was the singer and erstwhile guitarist of the legendary Les Seldoms, and Laurie was the singer and saxophonist/flautist with Clean Dog (fliers here). I felt a little left out, never having been in a band.
In time for the end of our family’s official one year grieving process, I met once more my 5 year old second cousin. He is the son of my father’s first cousin and I just met him last year during the wake of my Grandfather. EJ is still the usual bubbly, cute and bibo kid, except that he grew bigger. He would still munch on chicharon and would ask for candies from time to time.

The film might be slightly over-long, with a lot of story to pack in, but it is still a joy from start to finish. Jam-packed with catchy songs, and terrific dancing, it’s full of colour, life and laughter. Although Streisand clearly IS too young for the role, she still plays the part well, and makes Dolly a thoroughly loveable woman. The character could have been irritating, but Streisand allows Dolly’s love for life, and desire for happiness shine through – as well as her vulnerabilities.
With a gorgeous name to match it. If you're in the mood
Also, I have already received a bunch of emails asking me about when I will be hosting another workshop. Well, I hope to do another in the Fall, probably late September. In the meantime, I may have another opening or 2 for one on one mentoring here in Utah this spring (or even possibly a group of 2-3). So if you are interested please email me for details.
The compound of sorts to the right is George Lucas’s Skywalker Ranch. He owns 4700 acres and just 15 are developed. Manmade Ewok Lake must be the water that’s visible. Lucas reportedly does not live there. It’s a retreat of sorts. His headquarters are in the Letterman digital Arts Center in the Presidio of SF. The valley is not named after him, BTW, but an early figure in local history.
That last one is kind of weird, because there isn’t much that I really enjoyed in Cataclysm. It’s mostly just that I miss the people there I guess. I was part of a really amazing guild full of fun people, but the game itself was boring me to tears. It just wasn’t worth the money to keep playing. Now with Mists of Pandaria news trickling in, I’ve got the urge to go back and say hello. It almost feels shameful in some respects because I’m supposed to be a “TOR player” now.
A question remains, however, about smoking non-tobacco. One candidate immediately comes to mind because it, like tobacco, is a natural leaf. Marijuana is also noteworthy because it is used in the same ways as smoking tobacco.
As the R31 came to rest, the driver jumped out and the fire marshals arrived from a post a few meters up the track. Two marshals tackled the blaze, running from behind the car to around the front to direct foam over the sidepods. As the first marshal carried on towards the rear of the car, the second marshal arrived at the front of the sidepods. Then there was this burst of debris and gas from the front of the sidepod. This appeared to slightly injure the marshal who limped around to the rear of the car. Renault have confirmed “he is ok. No injury. We are sending him a nice gift”. Shrapnel from the burst lay several meters away from the car in the pitlane exit lane. As we’ve seen fire’s are relatively rare in F1, oil fires being the more common and spectacular, but it’s very rare for a burning car to have this sort of violent moment.

Last night, as I stood in front of the Fred Meyer beer cooler, I submitted to a foolish urge: reacting to the unseasonably warm weather, I bought a Lindemans Peche. I love lambics, perhaps more than any style, but I am a cheapskate. The Buddhists say that we are governed by twin urges of craving and desire, and this decision was wrought with equal measures of each.

Doesn’t have to be a physics definition. That is, we want to know what comes to mind when you think of the word force, not what you think I want you to say! Think about it for a minute. Then talk at your table and write up a quick whiteboard with your definition. 3 minutes, max. All good definitions in their own contexts.
I played 90′s hip-hop during the first half of the night. A white guy who looked a young twenty-something began making an ass of himself.
So imagine my delight when traipsing through Tesco on a blustery and grim Monday evening, looking for ball point pens for a computer class I was running, I stumbled upon Orginal Source’s newest offering – strawberry shower gel.
MAKIN: We do get a heading in the account which is ‘meeting collections’ and that’s £80,000. But then there’s another for the year which is ‘donation income - other’ - in other words, by definition, not at meetings, and that is a little over £62,000, and I just question how that £62,000 has been arrived at, because £62,000 is a surprisingly high amount to be other unspecified.

What was the spark that kicked off your interest in songwriting?
need to hear it. And not just because it’s yet another reminder of the shituation as it stands. But also because, more to the sodding point, it a) really doesn’t need to be said, b) really doesn’t make me feel any better and c) really can’t be all we’ve got to talk about… can it?

This is a part of post modernist theory. Its like saying that you cannot improve on who you are, if you dont know everything about yourself first. You cant make plans for the future if you cannot embrace your past. Richards’ comment has almost a chinese proverb element to it. He is saying that you cannot simply create a character (in this case a building) without first establishing a back story. What influenced it, why did it come to be, who is it for, what is its intended purpose (physical or otherwise). You cannot create something original without first knowing (and acknowledging) what came before it, otherwise, how would you know for sure that it was original???

The 10 states that did meet all accountability goals in all three areas for ELLs—known as “annual measurable achievement objectives,” or AMAOs—were Alabama, Delaware, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. Under the rules of Title III, each state sets its own specific AMAOs, which are goals for progress in learning English as measured by results on English-language-proficiency exams, attainment of fluency in English, and demonstration of ELLs’ proficiency on state content tests in reading and mathematics.
My three-year-old grandaughter took the picture above. I picked her up so she could reach the branches of the tree. It was actually shot toward the bright, afternoon sun. She very quickly caught on to shooting high, shooting low, shooting toward light and with it behind you. She is an eager and bright student. (She suggested that I leave my camera with her because she thought that once I got home I could buy another one. Life is so simple at three years old. )

It’s here, what you’ve all been waiting for, and I couldn’t be more excited to share my laughter with you.

It was actually kind of fun to case someone else's card! The image I have used is CC Lula (yet another previously uninked TGF stamp I own).

The seam binding ribbon and twine is from The Ribbon Girl. The buttons and brad are from my stash (I think Doodlebug and My Mind's Eye respectively). The flowers are from Prima.

Russian patriotism proved as strong as its German equivalent and the war was turned around. And to this day, Russians still refer to the Second World War as simply "The Great Patriotic War". Stalin may have started out as an international socialist but he soon became a national socialist when he saw how effective that was in getting popular support. Again, however, it was Mussolini who realized it first. And it is perhaps to Mussolini's credit as a human being that his nationalism was clearly heartfelt where Stalin's was undoubtedly a mere convenience.
And I think that the Grizz are awesome and are put together most perfectly but it’s not enough. Someone super crucial to that team will not be there next year. Be it Rudy Gay or Z-Bo, or even O.J. Mayo. One or two of those guys will be gone. But, it would be amazingly cool to have the Grizz win the next game and maybe push the action movie formula inwards.
But some nights I'll be up like 400-500 dollars and then all of a sudden I get bullets (pocket Aces aka two Aces in my hand) and I obviously can't lay that down- but then my "Aces get cracked" (beaten) by some shit like 7-9 off suit or some horrendous blow like that. Then I want to die because if I'd walked away I would have had a lot of money.
Now, this works in the lab but not in actual biological systems because the enzymes that prepare and copy DNA, for example, will only work with the sugars and phosphates. But there is no reason that other enzymes could not work with other chemical structures. Which means we have proof - not a hypothesis, but proof - that life does not have to be life as we know it and life on Earth using sugars and phosphates rather than some other possible combination may have been just by chance.

Now the food was very tasty and was a good value. There was a lot of volume in all of our meals. Glen (who helps with Dad twice a week), Dad & I went together. First came a nice cabbage salad with a sweet soy dressing. We asked that the miso soup be served Japanese-style at the end of the meal instead of with the salad. However, we were so full at the end, that we asked for it in a to-go container. It was good even heated up the next day.

Kaname is another big draw. Beautifully and poignantly drawn, he is a man of mysteries, with his overt protective adoration of Yuki contrasting with some pretty dark doings involving considerable violence. Coupled with an otherworldly control (all but unheard of among vampires) is a rather amoral willingness to use people to serve his purposes. To all outward appearances, he is far more humane and well-intentioned than most of his ilk, and yet . . . Those loyal to him are fiercely so, including both Yuki and the Cross Academy headmaster. I find the characters of a number of the night class students appealing, even though we only get tantalizing glimpses.

Part of the history of Kelowna includes the legend of a lake 'monster' known as 'Ogopogo' or 'N'ha-a-itk' (pronounced Naitaka), by the Salish First Nations tribe. Naitaka means 'lake demon'. The name, Ogopogo, was evidently a parody of a British ditty and goes like this: "His mother was an earwig: His father was a whale: A little bit of head And hardly any tail-And Ogopogo was his name."

To begin with I forget my bag at home. This meant that I didn't have Mason's food, Helen's snack or my wallet. We used to have a membership to the museum, but let it lapse in favor of making a small contribution whenever we visit, which is about three or four times a month and most of the free Saturdays as well.
Black Widow was a real surprise, offering up good action and the deepest emotional investment of the movie. Scarlett Johansson was really good in a part I expected to amount to nothing. If not for the Hulk, I suspect folks might be talking about how she stole this movie.
At a certain point, exhausted and really needing to sleep on the nights we were home, we put him in the bed between us. It was the only way to get him to sleep and stop crying. I was aware this was a horrible idea, but so sleep deprived it didn’t matter. We built a barrier to prevent us from rolling over him, and I draped my arm over it. As long as he held on to me, he seemed to sleep.
When I was a kid, I would often have dreams where I would do things like go to the bathroom (I know, exciting). Granted, that could be anxiety over being able to actually make it when I was a child. Since I haven’t had that dream since the age of 10… I think that might be a safe bet.

Then we got up to the counter and it rang up at $13.99. Yes, $13.99. I held my breath. The cashier, who apparently really wanted to charge me $49.99, called over not one, but two managers, who looked at the computer and then at the shower curtain and then at each other and then at me and then finally, eventually decided that because they couldn't prove it wasn't $13.99, they'd have to go with the computer on this one.

While the film moves as far afield as New York and Las Vegas, the other star is the exquisitely rendered and vibrantly colored Havana. The filmmakers spent several months shooting on location in Havana, and their attention to detail produces a feeling that is both realistic and seductive. I can’t wait to visit Cuba.
How will the rules change?
Hmm, what to choose?
So for January, these are year long goals.
On our way, we called at Upton house, home of the Samuels family, of Shell Oil. The ambience is that of a house party in the thirties, although the collection of pictures is quite impressive, and worth millions. We were able to view the paintings without the inevitable press of people in the National Galleries.

Over the last ten years Germany grew rich by selling cars to peasants in Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Now these countries are broke and will sooner or later default on their debts.

This woman has to move out by the end of TODAY, and was still packing. She also had to WORK today, get her youngest kid enrolled in his new school (did not succeed today), and get her lease signed.
Not that these form totally distinct stages. This is an overly simplified model. You don't necessarily finish developing prerequisites before you start working with patterns, for instance. There are overlaps. At different times, you could be working multiple layers at once.
Why don’t they get up when the sun comes up? I lie down on the rug again. And like yesterday, she gets up after awhile and takes me outside.
I do realize that it's October 21. I should be on day 21, not day 13 of this 31-day series.
Schofield will resume his post in the bomber for this year's show. He said he's thrilled he'll once again have a chance to bring a part of Canada's military history to life.
The ideas I quoted can be dismissed out of hand. They do not qualify as race realism; they are in fact simply racism. You know anti-white racism? Well... see above for some anti-Jewish racism.
Year of the Flood, according to Margaret Atwood, is not a sequel or prequel to Oryx & Crake but a simultaneal.

If you dabble in the writing and publishing industry, unless you've gone blackout the last two years, then you've heard about the surge of self-publishing (or Indie publishing) as things go more digital. And since you've likely heard all the pros and cons and predictions from a whole bunch of people with more credentials than me, I'm not even going to get into that discussion. What I do want to say is that I've decided not to pursue that direction right now.

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the new life in Christ; thank You for making me a new creation in Christ Jesus; now I know that everything that’s not consistent with the new creation life has completely passed away from my life, and all things have become new! Thank You for granting me the life and nature of righteousness, and for ushering me into the supernatural life of victory, having begotten me through Your Spirit, by the Word; in Jesus Christ Name Amen!
Irvin deserves everything good that has come to him.
What many people, including the man himself, consider to be Hitchcock’s finest film, this is another thriller that I believe totally fits the bill as a horror movie. Joseph Cotten is charming Uncle Charlie, come to pay a visit to his namesake niece in California. What the young girl doesn’t know is that sweet Uncle Charlie is also the Merry Widow Killer, seducing and killing a series of wealthy widows, and part of his visit is motivated by a need to flee one of his recent bloody conquests.
For 10 Euros, I am impressed by the length of the spectacle, which stretches over nearly two hours. The children around me are also thrilled by the sights and sounds, the clowns, the acrobats and especially the animals. The show starts with eight tigers and continues with horses, llamas, yaks, doves, goats and dogs. It does all seem quaint and old-fashioned, but I am disturbed most by an obstacle course set up for a troupe of panicking ducks who are chased around the ring with sticks.
A huge dishonorable mention goes to the Arizona legislature for even entertaining the idea of allowing women to be fired from their jobs if they use birth control.
Sure enough, hot on the heels of last week’s post about smart windows comes this great example of an augmented reality app that does exactly that. The Net-a-Porter augmented reality shop window app is about to be launched across several cities. To take advantage of it, you simply download the app, point your smart phone at items in the window and you get an augmented reality fashion show experience – as well as the ability to place an order.

Combine the flour and sour cream. Whisk in a few spoons of the hot liquid and, then whisk all of that back into the pot. Simmer for about 3 minutes until the gravy thickens.Check the seasoning and return the rouladen to the pot. Cook for a few more minutes until they heat through.
Unfortunately, LVRB is not as good as BBB. Take Bachna Ae Haseeno and Badmaash Company, mix together with the stylist from Dhoom and you have LVRB. The film looks and feels very familiar and though it is an entertaining watch, it is nowhere near the richness of detail and nuance that BBB had. Even if we set BBB to one side, LVRB still has a few problems. The biggest one for me was Ricky Bahl himself (who only uses his real name once in the film a la James Bond in Casino Royale – you know my name etc). What are Ricky’s motivations for conning the girls? Why does he give up his wicked ways so quickly for Ishika? (A no brainer really – what wouldn’t you give up for Anushka Sharma?) Is Ricky a misogynist?! Whilst it may seem I am nit-picking, I did find towards the end I didn’t care what happened to Ricky or if the girls got their money back, as by that stage, any emotional investment in the film had already been spent.
Moi had a visual to go with her haiku. More traditional in the sense that she writes about good, old fashion, summertime sweat. Ineffectual swipe is really good and conveys the helplessness of sweating. And who hasn't had Coppertone hit their eyes like a can of pepper spray?

But what the media isnt broadcasting out in the open is that the GI Files leaked information leading to believe that Israel has ALREADY destroyed Iran’s nuclear plant using Rebel Kurds and their own intelligence agency. According to the e-mail here is the source’s response: “Israeli commandos in collaboration with Kurd forces destroyed a few underground facilities mainly used for the Iranian defence and nuclear research projects.”

Or what about the other things writers write when their signing? "To So-and-So" - well, early on I learned from an experienced author to always have some spare paper and an extra pen for children to write their first names on. You CAN'T just wing it, and it is a law of nature that the child with the most obscurely-spelt name is also the one with the tiny, tiny voice ...
You’ve got two more teeth that have properly come through. The top left big one and the one next to it, you’ve had a bit of a nasty couple of weeks with that really, there’s still another three or four that I can see on the brink of cutting through and it’s causing you quite a bit of pain. We’re still a bit hit and miss with the sleeping but think that’s due to the teeth, some days are better than others. Our swimming lesson the week before last I had to get you out about half way through because of your teeth, you was not a happy boy, so lots of cuddles and tlc! At swimming you really like the floats, you use them as teethers so we end up keeping hold of one the whole lesson while you’re chomping away on it, maybe I need one for at home for you to teeth on!
Your body also is as much external to you as that yonder mango tree. It is also a mental percept or mental concept. The mango tree is external to you with reference to your body only. The mango tree itself is a mere appearance that floats in the Absolute or the One Reality. As the mango tree is external to you from the standpoint of your body, and as the body itself is external to you, the idea of externality of the mango tree or this external universe is blown up now. The term internality also has a false existence only. There is internality only with reference to the externality. If the externality goes away, where is the internality? Both the terms internality and externality are mere illusions, creations of the mind. There is only the solid existence, the One Reality or Absolute behind the so-called internality and externality. That is the Real, Infinite. “I” is your own lower self.
For ten years--ever since she was a small child--Ella has been held prisoner. Now that she has escaped, she needs answers. Who is she? Why was she taken? And who is the boy with the beautiful green eyes who haunts her memories? Is Ella the prophesied Destructor... or will she be the one who's destroyed?
While it was not butterflies and kittens the waxing was not nearly as painful as I thought it would be. Actually, it was not really painful at all, though that may be due to the skill of the esthetician. It was an interesting process, and also interesting to think that a majority of Turkish women do this on a regular basis. While I was assimilating culturally I also found my first Turkish homonyms

Most sports understand that the athlete is the product and that with no product there is no sport – at least there isn’t the ability to package and sell that sport to the masses. That’s why in the BIG professional team sports like the NFL. MLB, and NBA they deal with collective bargaining agreements that guarantee the athletes a percentage of the league income – often approaching 50%. It’s also why other professional sports that deal with athletes as individuals – NASCAR, the PGA, Beach Volleyball, among others – the athletes are allowed to solicit their own sponsorships AND advertise them on their person. In NASCAR the competition vehicle itself becomes rolling advertising!

But then it got freaky. Baby kept pushing her hand further and further out until it POPPED out of my stomach! I shoved it back in as fast as I could and pressed my hand over where the hole should be, expecting blood and guts and other disgusting stuff to pour out of me, but when I didn't feel any pain and moved my hand, there was nothing there. My pregnant belly was the same as before.

There is a reason for the co-opting of the Occupy Wall Street Movement by religious extremists bent toward Sharia Law, it goes hand in hand with their anti-Semitic protests against the Jews at the Federal Reserve as was recently put by one protester at the Occupy protests at Zuccotti Park. While the media has largely vilified a harmless secular Jewish man who goes by the tag “Lotion Man”, they have ignored the real anti-Semites who continue to dominate the movement and suppress all atheist opposition such as the Fart Smeller Movement campaign which has gotten several violent threats from Occupy Wall Street organizers who supposedly believe in freedom of speech.

I mean, I’ve seen literally dozens of people sporting the walking boot look in the past couple of weeks. There’s certainly no way that many college kids could be that dumb on Spring Break. Right?!
It started snowing around 11:00 and since we haven't seen hardly any this year (so weird) we all ran like little kids (well, Pup and his friend Doug did anyway) to look at it.
Instead, let’s talk about what’s here. What’s here is a shit-ton of blood. Seriously, I like horror movies, but The Passion of the Christ is bloodier than most. Christians, by and large, seem to like the bloody Jesus, too, since you won’t find too many films more passionately defended by the faithful.
I thought the channel is playing some remixed version as the lyrics were very much superimposed by the music. But it said “Exclusive: Ragini MMS”. The very first thing that came in my mind was that Bappi da (Bappi Lahri) must have composed the song and yes, he is back with bang of popularity. Today out of curiosity, i searched the net and to all my surprise the song indeed is a remix version taken in this movie. The song is from the 1995 movie “Rock Dancer” and ofcourse the music was composed by none other than Bappi da!!!
Even the kids see the association. It was funny at first but now I’m starting to feel it’s all a little sad. I don't want to turn into a bag lady. I started buying boxes instead of bottles. It didn’t look quite so desperate (or was it because it hid how much I was drinking?) But then I realised I could get through a box of wine in three to four days. It’s too easy to keep topping up with a box. And it was even more of a shock when I calculated how many units are in a box. Mum’s psychological crutch had increased to a bottle of wine a night. How shocking is that?
And that’s just one of my books. When I consider all of them, my gratitude is unending. I am grateful I never had to twice attend my mother’s funeral as poor Bob Stark did in More Deaths Than One. I’m grateful I have not yet had to deal with an epidemic so severe that the entire state of Colorado needs to be quarantined as described in A Spark of Heavenly Fire. I am grateful that I am not being held captive in an underground installation run by a quasi-government agency as are my heroes in Light Bringer, which will be released in the spring of 2010.

I think 'fair play' is exactly the right notion for tango. It is play - it is not art. It can, optionally, be sort of competitive, when people feel like it, and that's totally fine and all part of the fun and satisfaction. But when it comes down to it, it's play, and not playing fair doesn't make you a creative genius, it makes you a sociopath, or at least a pillock. It makes you, in short, a cheat, and not fun to play with. You play as well as you can, and if it's better than someone else, everyone respects that. But you play fair.
OK, sorry for no scans. And, Marcus, sorry for the delay in getting your cards over. You should have 80 or so Padres (new and old) and a few other guys you mentioned, arriving in the next day or so. Life, per usual, hung me up a bit.
Many of us do not continue to grow spiritually because we prefer to choose on the basis of our rights, instead of relying on God to make the choice for us. We have to learn to walk according to the standard which has its eyes focused on God. And God says to us, as He did to Abram, “. . . walk before Me. . .” (Genesis 17:1).

A shadowed presence made itself known to Darius, but proved itself invisible. Shadows lengthened, strange whispers carried through the halls and Darius found the house’s very architecture began to bend and twist as he wandered through it, seeking help. Eventually he and Horace met in a seemingly endless hallway with no doors save one at the very end, emitting green light through cracks in the jamb. Try as they might, Darius and Horace couldn’t escape the impossible hallway or the haunting whispers. In frustration, Darius flung the glowing green door open . . . and Grift was rudely awoken by the gibbering wreck of a bard slamming his bedroom door open, yanking the sheets up tight around his person in surprise.

I saw this when I was a young teen and dreamed of being a ballerina myself. Several of the dancers from my studio got together and drooled over it on many occassions. This will remain in my heart as my number one ballet movie because of the mirror of real events in Baryshnikov's life at the time, and the whirlwind of Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine together.

The body usually has a long, sleek tail and legs and a curved torso. This depiction usually stands alone, however, there are occasionally dashes of colorful images thrown in for effect such as a bright red bow around its neck, a blue studded collar; it may even be set amongst a burgundy silk pillow, or tiger striped rug.

Ok so funny story. I've just accepted that apparently everyone at church is aware of my year long project. I've stopped marveling when practically everyone there makes comments to me about how it's going, but today I really did get a shock. I walk into my hairdressers salon to get my hair done and she says to me, "Oh my gosh, how is your food storage thing going?" LOL! I guess there really will be no way to escape this path. Even my hairdresser is watching me.

To begin this card I cut a piece of Real Red card stock 5-1/2" x 8-1/2" and scored it at 4-1/4". Next I cut a piece of Basic Gray card stock 3-3/4" x 5", two pieces of Basic Gray DSP 1-1/4" x 3-1/2, and one piece of Basic Gray DSP 2" x 3-1/2". I adhered the Basic Gray DSP onto the Basic Gray card stock. Then I cut a strip of Basic Black card stock 5/8" x 5" and adhered it across the Basic Gray panel. Then I wrapped a piece of Tempting Turquoise 1/4" Grosgrain Ribbon around the panel and tied it into a knot. To add just a little bit of bling I used the Paper Piercer and Mat Pack to pierce three holes in the upper right hand corner of the panel and added three Silver Brads. This panel was then adhered onto the card front.

It’s pretty obvious – I’ve got a Blizzie problem, and I’ve got it bad. A snack-sized Blizzard hovers around the $3 mark. $3 is a small price to pay for a good 10 minutes of Reese peanut butter deliciousness. However, I wore a collection of items the other day that might be the wake-up call I need to kick this habit. Most of the items I’m wearing in this post also cost me $3. That belt? $3. That vintage camera case reborn as a purse? $3. That yellow and green bracelet? 3 Cuban pesos. The final kicker? That rainbow, floral explosion skirt was $3 as well (and had a tag from a previous vintage dealer that deemed it a $39.99 skirt). These items didn’t melt. These items didn’t leave me with a bloated dairy belly, and these items will be in my closet for the rest of my days.

I am generally willing to talk to anyone about adoption – yet there are some that I just can’t because our values and how we view adoption will never ever be compatible in any way. Yet at the same time I believe talking to others in adoption helps expand everyone’s views – as long as you are open to hearing the words.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized by persistent and relapsing fatigue, often accompanied by numerous symptoms involving various body systems. The etiology of CFS remains unclear; however, a number of studies have shown that oxidative stress may be involved in its pathogenesis. In the present study, a mouse model of CFS was used in which mice were forced to swim for one 6-minute session on each day for 15 days and the immobility period was recorded. There was a significant increase in immobility period in saline-treated mice on successive days. Intraperitoneal treatment with the potent antioxidants carvedilol (5 mg/kg) and melatonin (5 mg/kg) produced a significant reduction in immobility period. Similar results were observed with herbal preparations administered orally: Withania somnifera (100 mg/kg), quercetin (50 mg/kg), and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum L., 10 mg/kg). Biochemical analysis revealed that chronic swimming significantly induced lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels in the brains of mice. The rats also showed decreased levels of antioxidant defense enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase. Co-administration of antioxidants carvedilol, melatonin, W. somnifera, quercetin or St. John’s wort significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and restored the GSH levels decreased by chronic swimming in mice. Further, the treatment increased levels of SOD in the forebrain and of catalase. The findings strongly suggest that oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of CFS and that antioxidants could be useful in the treatment of CFS.

USA is a rich nation, but stop sequestering the land which can be cultivated and used for ranching and framing, and create REAL jobs. Internet is rubbish once this system is up. And dot the land with 1000s of farms along the way, pay wages by the day, pay wages in food? USA needs to grow more food not produce more paper shuffling or computer obsessed jobs.

I was reeling at Bryson about it and it occurred to me that it was highly unlikely this was the first or only incident. I went back up to his room where I found him sitting on the floor twiddling something in his hands. I sat on the floor next to him and told him we had more to talk about. I told him that I was going to Walgreens for a drug test and that he needed to tell me what I was going to find out before the test did. I couldn't believe my ears when he started crying and said he was so scared to tell me the truth, but that he really wanted to. The truth that he had been smoking cigarettes since he was 10 and had been smoking weed since we moved here in December. I cried. TWO YEARS?
I live in the Bible Belt. I am surrounded by Southern Baptist Churches, conservative Evangelicals, bigots and the Klan. For me, this is just a reality and something I live with everyday. I was raised in church while living in a fairly free-thinking household. My mother encouraged my thoughts and my doubts. She listened to and answered as many of my questions as she could.

When I was 12, my Spanish teacher said I wrote beautifully. I believed her at the time and her words had more influence on me than she could have expected. I felt I was good with words and it gave me the confidence to use them and try to improve the way I used them. I often wonder if she really meant it, but even if she didn't, they gave me something to exploit and pursue.

To wet your appetite a little for Chesterton I have selected a few quotes for you to read:
I searched in vain in the Atlas for such an opening. Believe me, I read the Japan chapter from beginning to end several times, and was not only unable to find any small errors of detail, but also none of the cultural pratfalls that it is quite common to read in foreigners' writing about Japan. Broom is no stranger to the country, but in this respect his work reminds me of the late Michael Jackson's. I read Jackson's books and am amazed that a person who did not live over here could get the tone so right, avoiding all the errors of emphasis that seem to plague other writers. Broom, like Jackson, is relaxed enough in his writing not to eschew cultural commentary and references, but his research appears to be strong enough to keep his footing sure. Add to that Broom's intimidating grasp of whisky in general and you get the sort of confidence that can pen sentences like:

Every film can capture something in its frames and make it valuable and worth saving, even if it's just the gaze of a pretty girl. And in this specific instance, I helped give that back to the people who needed it most.

Focus on the Family, Christianity Today, Christian Stay at Home Moms and Christian Teen Magazine are among some of the Christian groups who’ve been misled by occult delusion, and instead of warning Christians of its dangers, have compromised its lying message.

(Isa. 5:20-21)
I have never seen an envelope so bent in so many directions in my entire life. (And yes, the card was bent, too.) It looked intentional, and although I partly thought it was hilarious, it is also contributing to my mail-carrier-paranoia. I know mail delivery people are just that–people, too–and that people make mistakes. But I also don’t personally know any mail carriers, and although I really like the people behind the counter at the post office near Now Church, they aren’t the ones who remove the post from my mailbox or put it in, either. These two facts make it really really easy to imagine that the people hired by the government to deliver the mail are either lacking some IQ points, or else a little passive-aggressive. I suppose if I were really honest, I would admit that my tendency to suspect the latter might also be at least tenuously related to the fact that when I worked at Starbucks, we used to give decaffeinated beverages to customers who we thought were jerks. Or who never tipped. The customer may always be right, but the purveyor of the service doesn’t have to like it–and quite often doesn’t agree.

It Chooses You is a compelling hybrid of photobook, memoir and social observation. The photos were made by July’s wedding photographer, Brigitte Sire. There is an awkwardness to some of the portraits — the transactions, such as they were, were not always the most comfortable. But the subjects with whom July and her small crew warmed up to made for the warmest and most touching photos. Curious details of the sellerss home and wares are also pictured. I’l lleave it to the reader to discover the fascination of a series of hand-labelled manila envelopes. Although the book has a naturally episodic nature, a kind of narrative develops as July ponders the class divide between her and her subjects, her own neuroses about the creative process, and the small miracle of human beings connecting with each other at all.
He was starting to consider the possibility that Greer had called out sick just to start his weekend early when he heard a shuffling sound on the other side of the door.

What am I going to do? It's the day after graduation, and my family will be in town, so after church I'll hand round a gallon of sunscreen for my Indiana family to put on to protect themselves from the Texas sun, and then we'll go find a parking space somewhere near the BikeTexas building (which happens to be inside the car-free zone!). After I introduce my family to my BikeTexas coworkers, we'll stroll down Sixth and see what is happening, until some of us get tired or overheated or both. If you see one bewildered elderly woman plus two bewildered middle-aged people plus three happy 30(ish)somethings... you've found us. Stop and say hello!
So Iuz has to go. How? Well - the recession of magic that Pluffet Smedger mentions is a clue. My guess is that the only way to get rid of him and secure the keystone once and for all was to remake the Staff of Law and remove magic from the Oerth, or more to the point, removing the Oerth from magic. Shift the entire world from the magical Prime it exists in to a mundane Prime like ours, where magic and fantastical beings like gods, dragons, demons and olve cannot exist (or at least cannot thrive, but rather dwindle and fade).

I could hear the sound of the surf all around me. I love how the direction of the waves shift based on the wind direction and when the breeze is on shore it is amazing how loud the crashing surf can be. Today the surf was especially loud and it echoed through me making me feel like one of those sea shells you pick up and put to your ear.

We repurposed an old atlas and music book to make paper chains and hanging hearts. The paper chain will swag and be hung from the chairs going down the center isle. The hearts will likely be hung from branches in the reception area. I got the idea of the hanging paper hearts on Pinterest.
I tried to color an actual, colorful, swirled lollipop. I added some clear embossing powder over it to give it some shine. It's hard to see in my picture but it's pretty cool in person. I made a grassy hill for my bunny to stand on and I added in the clouds by sponging with white craft ink and using a negative from a cloud die cut. I also embossed my sentiment which is a great way to add a little shine and really have your sentiment pop off the kraft paper.

Okay, okay... we're talking about sixteen months here, but I'm pretty sure time is flying by so quickly now, we'll be at the real sweet sixteen before we know it. Alli is such a character, a little mini-me, and just plain exhausting at times. She loves to point at everything until she gets what she wants, shake her head "no" to anything we offer her (even if she really does want it), and imitates everything we do. She has a hilarious fake laugh, fake cough, fake sneeze, etc... she just thinks she's the funniest little girl ever too. Wonder why? We laugh at her and encourage her all the time... I'm sure that's not helping the situation! =)

There are many women who have a thyroid condition. Notice I said condition not disease. I call it that because it is something we live with not die from, and trust me when I say I live with it every day. Thyroid problems run in family like they do in many families. My aunt has it (hyper) my mom's sister and my mom had it (hyper). I found out I have it as well last year it right after my sister found out she has it. Funny how we found out within weeks of each other and we are only a year apart. My sister has hyper as well, so how in the world did I get hypo? Sure, everyone else gets the one that makes you skinny, me, I get the one that makes you fat. Like I haven't been struggling with my weight ever since I can remember. Don't get me wrong, I am far from fat. At almost 5' tall and ranging between 109 and 110 I'm not complaining. I'm smaller now that I was in high school. In college I gained the freshman 15 and then some so I know what it is like to be overweight. I worked my ass off to get my weight down so I'll be damned if some thyroid problem is going to change that now! My point is thyroid conditions are not easy to deal with. As soon as you think things are working out- your medicine is working and your gain your energy back- Bam the medicine isn't working like it should and your numbers are through the roof again.
Have a wonderful Easter and I hope to be back soon!!
Pause. Remember. Selah.
I was crazy tired this morning from getting home so late last night from such a wonderful and exciting day. I totally eased into my day slowly. Liesl and I decided that the best option for today was to relax on the sofa with a blanket. I got to watch the race at Talledega and nap on and off. Liesl totally supported this decision and napped with me. It was such a quiet day. This is good because I am still trying to get rid of this darn cough.
So, my job is to set the emotional part aside and decide from the long list of dishes that have been chosen for gastronomic, fond memories and many other personal reasons, what will work on the day.
Then reinforce the fact you aren’t telling them not to do drugs but that drugs have consequences. Tell them if they do drugs you will buy it for them….. with their college money, because if they do drugs basically college is going to be a waste of time, so you might as well spend it on killing their brain instead of expanding it. Break it down for them, tell them exactly how much they have to spend on drugs/college, say if you go to college you will also get a car, if you do drugs I don’t want you driving and you will probably live at home with Daddy until you’re 40 and be working a McDonalds.
The main thing here is that I need to take a shower. Grimy, sweaty, smelly woman I am, cleaning takes a lot outta ya when it's 80 degrees.
But as I understand this dilemma, we are not completely isolated. Though we cannot by our own powers escape our limits, we are subject to correction from, so to speak, the outside. I can hardly expect everybody to believe, as I do (with due caution), that inspiration can come from the outside. But inspiration is not the only way the human enclosure can be penetrated. Nature too may break in upon us, sometimes to our delight, sometimes to our dismay.
Boring, hard, and no fun!
As a result, this novel will come across to most people as confusing and messy with laughs that are few and far between. Despite its short length (a tad over 300 pages) it is a difficult read that makes it hard to care about anybody or anything. You may also need to backtrack to remind yourself of what happened to this character before. It also seems to lack overall direction at times with little asides into separate short stories.
April is all about Spring. Spring cleaning and spring purging! I love to purge down in the spring, it always seems to bring a fresh and simple feeling to the home.
If you are in the mood for a creepy read, this one's for you! I admit that I am not a big fan of paranormal and I am very picky when it comes to the books I choose. However, when David Morgan contacted me about a possible review for his book, The Boo Hag, I read the synopsis and immediately knew I wanted to read it. Actually, I knew I wanted to read it as soon as I saw the cover. Those big, creepy red eyes over the sleeping girl raised the hair on my arms. I am so happy to say that The Boo Hag did not disappoint!
And boots. Boots make anything seem possible.

We’re human, we’re prone to mistakes, don’t ruminate on it. Just resolve to do better next time and move on. In other words…hit the reset button. We all want to have a rocking holiday season, but wouldn’t it be nice to have a New Year’s resolution that wasn’t “I want to loose the (fill in the number) of pounds that I put on in the last 2 months”???? How about setting a resolution to climb that mountain that you’ve had your eyes on?

Two weekends ago, the children and I spent an afternoon of just goofing off. Our first stop was the library. My son is an avid reader, and Michaela is getting better at comprehending what she reads, so I encourage her to read more than what her curriculum requires her to.

I'm always happy to hear of ways to help others through crafting. One way cardmakers can help a very worthy cause is to join in with the St Lukes Charity Challenge. This is a monthly challenge, with prizes, where you not only make a card, but also actually send it in along with any others you may have spare. The cards are sold to raise money for the St Lukes Hospice in Sheffield which cares for terminally ill people and offers support to their families. I think it's a great idea to help others by doing what we love!

All this has taken Borg from curiosity to celebrity. The Financial Times recently declared him the most effective finance minister in Europe. When we meet in his Stockholm office on a Friday afternoon (he and his aide seem to be the only two left in the building) he says he is just carrying on 20 years of reform. ‘Sweden was a textbook case of European economic sclerosis. Very high taxes and huge regulatory burden.’ An economic crisis in the early 1990s forced Sweden on the road to balanced budgets, and Borg was determined the 2007 crash would not stop him cutting the size of government.

Glenn Miller ran a tight ship; he usually fired people after the first incident. Eberle was stuck in traffic during a Chicago engagement, and was late for a rehearsal. Miller fired him on the spot, and replaced him in June 1942 with Skip Nelson. Eberle sang lead on “Sometime”, composed by Glenn Miller in 1939, “Polka Dots and Moonbeams“, “At Last“, a number 9 chart hit on Billboard in 1942, and “To You”. After his departure from Miller, Eberle briefly joined Gene Krupa’s band before launching a solo career[7].

Authors should note that Eprint is not a publisher offering print on demand author solutions—it is a print solutions company. While the company will assist, guide and advise an author on their book, it will not provide editing or manuscript evaluation services. The company will produce your printed book in a variety of bindings and sizes; make it available for purchase at on line retailers, but it is not in business to market an author’s book. This is reflected in the fact that the self publishing service is relatively recent and the company has just three books listed under Eprint on Amazon, though many authors now approach author solutions companies with their own ISBN's.

And so, I turned down the offer to write and run the course this summer. Instead we’re going to get together to discuss how to approach integrating tech tools into the course in the most natural and unobtrusive way possible. We want to negotiate a shared approach which will inform all aspects of the course: the lessons taught by the tutors on the first day of teaching practice, the unknown language lessons in the first week, the input sessions, the pre-course questionnaire and tasks, the materials assignments … everything. A kind of mission statement for principled use and best practice.

We weren’t in her house 2 minutes when I heard the dogs whimpering on the other side of her garage door. I left Lilly in her care and brought both dogs home. When I returned, Lil was happily entertained by a stuffed dog that the woman had on her side table.

This also reminds us how fragile is the economy of our second city. We already know that Swansea is over-dependent on public sector jobs, from local government to the DVLA, but there seems to be a blind spot about the third sector, which is also over-represented in the city. The third sector is composed of the kind of organisations I've mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs, reliant for their survival on grants and donations. As might be expected in the current economic climate, both sources of income are declining, made clear in the most recent set of accounts available on the Shelter Cymru website. But these are for 2009 / 2010, so we can assume that the position is even more desperate today. Which probably explains what's happening in Swansea, and at BBC Wales.

We were promptly directed to our rectangular plastic tables adorned with slideshow handouts, bottle opener, and pilsner glass.

As far as I’m concerned every class we ever pay for, regardless of the topic, should start like this one did. Our homebrewing guide came around to all the pupils and offered a tasting of previous classes brews. Somewhere in there my cynical side knows this was part of a ploy to get me to buy their homebrew kits. But I am perfectly okay with that.

See how the shades of blue are really random? I LOVE that! The white parts are where the rubber bands were, but the darker blue parts are from the second dump of darker dye. (The dress underneath is the Isaac Misrahi dress from My Sister's Closet in Phoenix--it's probably Isaac Misrahi for Wal-Mart or something, but it was more expensive than their other stuff--I bought it because of the color + linen. It has a bunch of tiny holes in it, which makes it even cooler to me and was probably what made it affordable). I love how they now look like they go together.)
No, nothing has the power to part me from you; our love is based upon virtue, and will last as long as our lives.

Lastly: what have I learned from restoring this parasol? First: the canopy is heavy. All the surviving canopies I've seen that aren't silk or lace have been fine, light cotton. Next time I do a canopy like this, I'll use cotton instead. Second: the "skirt" around the edge of the canopy doesn't really work. It tends to flip up when I open the parasol. I honestly don't think I've seen a skirt like this on a surviving canopy; skirts tend to be cut in crescents that leave the rib tips exposed. Now I think I know why!
In spite of this year's record breaking winter, my plants were in pretty good shape. I had brought many of my potted plants and window boxes inside my glass shed where they were somewhat sheltered from the extreme weather. They showed their appreciation by rewarding me with unusually early blooms. In the case of the vinca vine that is going on its third year, it bloomed for the first time, showing off pretty five petaled blooms. My strawberries actually had blossoms most of the winter and now they are blooming like crazy, exhibiting more buds than I have ever seen on them at one time.
Looking back I think, once again, I was worried for nothing when it came to another transition. Sleeping through the night, check! No more bottles, check! Potty Training, check! Now Toddler Beds, check! That’s the last big thing until Kindergarten right?! For now I’ll choose to not fight the battle of “making them lay still and go to sleep right away”. It’s working for us and it’s not too stressful! I’ll update you in a month or so. Hopefully I’m able to report they go to sleep within a few minutes of being put down, we’ll see!

To be fair, the article went on to say that Burden “said she has since changed her mind now that she has seen the design by Michael Van Valkenburgh.” (The intricately constructed park opened September 30, 2004 so Burden may have seen actual construction by that time)
In complete contrast, yesterday I piled on the sunscreen and strolled along the walkway to the Westpac Stadium in my shorts to see our local heros win a ding-dong match 4-2. I had one of the best seats in the stadium, right on the halfway line, and got $5 off the ticket price for being a student!
Then, I realized the heads and right-hands-with-huge-axes options were not going to be that heavy. It’s a light resin, so I punched some circles with some office circle-cutting thing (you probably know the name of the tool in English… I do not) from some little metal pie oven trays I keep around to make craters. Those are stuck to the hand and head variants, trimmed a bit, and glued. This is actually looking decent!
Definitely doing it again!

Darrell Issa held a hearing in Brooklyn titled ”Failure to Recover: The State of Housing Markets, Mortgage Servicing Practices, and Foreclosures.” It was filled mostly with members of the banking and regulatory community, as well as Edward Pinto of the conservative think-tank AEI. I love the “do-tank” nature of Pinto’s testimony, which states that the best thing we can do for the housing market – currently in the middle of several intense legal and regulatory disputes over allegations of systemic fraud – is to “Start by repealing the two biggest job killers – ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank.” Go Team Red!

Note: If mine, I would read Barwin's original lines as quick scribbles, scattered throughout my notebook, to be reordered, cobbled together into a workable poem. I’ve been more interested in troubling the narrative impulse and longer lines, so my natural impulse would be there, and in altering the rhythms to more reflect a series of flows and interruptions, flows and interruptions. I would remove, automatically, repeated words, first-person pronouns, the unbearable “I,” which is difficult to remove, especially when you do (it remains, even invisible, like a stain).

The investigations which together with opinions about them and governmental suggestions should give the ground for policies taken by parliament this autumn. The documents are now open for discussion. They do not in my opinion constitute an acceptable basis for a long-term policy. The documents make conclusions and assumptions about the effect of immigration and translocations based on calculations, which are not relevant for the current status and future scenarios. Programs are suggested, which probably are impossible besides very expensive and time-consuming. The wolf number and other criteria suggested for FCS are subjective and have not sufficient scientific basis. Proper definitions of key terminology is required.

The next time I woke up I had no idea what time it was, because our interior cabin had no natural light coming in. The phone was on my side of the bed, but I couldn't read the display in the dark.

Her first novel, Hope Against Hope, is published today by Myrmidon Books and its cover appears at the top of this article.

You're not allowed to look it up on Amazon, because that would be cheating. And no, Mrs Zigmond, while you’re allowed to comment you’re not allowed to play because you already know all the answers!
Also, as the Councillors’ Liaison Officer, I was seeing at first hand the disillusionment at coal face, with sole councillors in particular not being supported. Councillors were promised an internet set-up where they could debate and contact each other and share knowledge, (so they did not have to use their councils’ internet systems), but it was constantly being put off by Head Office. This meant that having worked hard to get councillors elected, once in post, they were steadily being demotivated by the lack of resources and assistance given to them, leaving individuals in an isolated, vulnerable position, and causing them in many cases to stand down through disillusionment and lack of support. Even in my own council of Barking and Dagenham, with some of the less able councillors, it was difficult to keep them up to speed, causing our stronger councillors to battle with the extra case-studies and mountains of bureaucracy in a struggle to make sure we did not look incompetent.

I stopped at Monterrey to get some seafood. Unfortunately, I hit Fisherman's Wharf, which is not to be confused with the same place in San Francisco. The SF version is fabulous; Monterrey's....not so much. More of a tourist trap for overweight, underflavored midwesterners to go for the "California experience." My wine was crap (especially for NoCal), my eggplant appetizer was old and bitter. However, the oysters I had were to die for. And they were blue points! No one's doing blue points any more; how come? They were meaty, sweet, and had that taste of the sea that you can only get from oysters. Plus, I was sitting outside on the bay. How bad could life be?

Nicole came to my moms last Tuesday to spend the last few weeks with us before she goes back to school. The first night she was here, she went with my cousin Julie and her oldest daughter Mollie to watch Mollie work some Volleyball games that evening. She stayed on the court with Mollie for a bit, but then decided she didn't like the balls coming at her that fast, so she switched to working in the concession stand. She wound up having a great time, so Julie asked her if she wanted to attend the Volleyball camp there for the next five weeks. She decided it sounded like fun.
Unlike deer, hogs can be killed year round by with either bow or rifle and anything else that would do the job. This is one of the most common ways to get some hogs. The wife's cousin put this hog trap out near the spot where he normally bow hunts because they are costing him to much cash in corn and not leaving enough for the deer. The trap has been out for about a week and has been tripped once, but so far hasn't caught anything. The same trap was used down the road and they trapped ten or twelve hogs, so it's really just a matter of time. With lots of corn on the ground it will take a while before they get hungry enough to go inside. If the ground was bare it would take less to get them inside.

I have read several books on the cosmetics industry and the first shocking bit of information I had known little about was that many companies we buy our make up, facial cleansing and moisturizing products, body products, etc from actually produce two different formulas - the product they sell here in the United States and the product (a much safer product) in European countries. The European Union came up with a Cosmetics Directive which they have banned 1000+ chemicals that are not allowed in products sold in European countries...the United States - 11. There are many wonderful people and organizations working on getting the Safe Cosmetics Act passed here in the United States that would hopefully get our number up a little higher.
With regard to Italy, the studies spoke of "L'exception italienne;" that is, despite the growing number of immigrants, Italy had not responded as many other countries had; either through sanctioned quotas or a growing anti-immigrant sentiment among the natives (though this had changed over the years). One of the reasons cited for this exception was that Italy itself has always been a patchwork of distinct regions, and thus Italians were used to dealing with those they saw as different from themselves. Italy, as we all know from our 6th grade text books began as a series of city-states. But even Italy as we now know it did not exist as a modern nation state until 1870. To this day, regional dialects and identities persist, though to a much lesser extent (Although if you watch AC Milan play AS Roma, the north/south distinction will become VERY clear).

But I found a chic little navy and white Pierre Cardin handbag this weekend, hidden in the unlikely corners of a tiny second-hand stall at Offset Festival. I will photograph it shortly. I love Pierre Cardin. My favourite pair of jeans ever were Cardin, a hand-me-down from my cousin, five years older than me. I grew out of them when I was fourteen though. It is sad that my jeans ownership peaked at such an age, but perhaps it is for the best. The cult of denim is something that mystifies and depresses me a little.

True confession: I have always been a bit of a junk food junkie. I have been able to eat bad-for-you foods for most of my life without having it affect my weight or general well-being, but I think those days are numbered. The scale has slowly been creeping up after each baby's arrival, and while I am not "overweight" - I know that I have not been eating WELL. So I don't deprive myself of anything I love, I just eat a little bit of it. And then I try to make my meals full of more fruits and vegetables and less of what is unhealthy. I don't count calories or points or anything. I can't do all that, it would drive me insane. I just try to put more "good stuff" in.... and leave more "bad stuff" out.

I received the nightlight a few days ago and I am so fascinated by it! It is amazing to look at the texture, knowing that the image is that of my children. Once I turn on the nightlight, there they instantly appear in full color!

to a time
When I was applying to schools the summer before Senior year, I thought I knew exactly where I was going to go. The previous summer I had attended the Canon Music Camp at Appalachian State University and studied with Joby Bell, the organ teacher there. After that camp my heart was set on going to Appalachian but then my mother went online to find other universities that had organ programs. Immediately Duquesne was her first choice because it is a Catholic school and she would be failing in her duties as a mother if she didn’t at least try to get me to go to a Catholic school, or at least somewhere with a close Catholic church. The nearest Catholic church by Appalachian State was at least 5 miles away and with no car, my mother was worried about my soul. I auditioned at 3 schools, was accepted to 4 schools, and ultimately decided to go to Duquesne because of the welcoming and friendly nature of the students, graduate assistant, and of course Dr. Labounsky.

Once upon a time I would have said that popular fiction was pretty much what I read. But after reading John Brendt's "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," I was sold on the possibility that a non-fiction book could be just as compelling as fiction. Possibly more so. Depending on how the story was told.
The later part of my day was a lot of fun, too. After running a quick errand, my mom dropped me off at the gym I go to and I finished a pretty quick, simple workout. I warmed up with 12 mins. on the stairmaster, then completed an interval workout based off of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVp8WbznVRc but I added 1 extra exercise = 7 rounds of mt. climbers, too. So my workout looked like this:
I asked Zoya if their staff had any favorite polishes that often get overlooked. They have over 300 colors and I felt sure that there were some gorgeous colors that hadn't gotten much attention. They sent me six colors to show you & I'm also including Pasha and Gaia which I purchased myself. So here we go, eight lovely Zoyas that you don't see very often. Lots of pictures!

3 Month Update: I ended up getting some Dr. Brown's wide-mouth bottles so she'd have to open her lips more like she does when breastfeeding - the regular Dr. Brown's are really tiny nipples and it didn't do great things for her latch. I'd go straight to wide-mouth next time. I also got a Tommee Tippee bottle that I like, and a Playtex Ventair and a Playtext Premium. So far there's not a bottle I don't like in terms for form/function - just that we needed the preemie nipples from Dr. Brown's (the only preemies we could find) when she was a small baby. The Breastflow are also a great speed for her now. I'm not sure why I kept getting different bottles to try other than the fact I thought I'd find a magic one that was the perfect flow and maybe even improved her (shitty) latch. But they've all been about the same for us. Some babies, though, are very picky and will only take a certain kind of bottle, so if you have one of those picky babies, I'd recommend trying any of the above. Note: it's also because of the picky baby thing that I wouldn't recommend getting a hundred of any one kind, just in case you have one of those babies and they don't like that brand.
I was then told in no uncertain terms how proud they all are of the new generation and what beautiful children they are inside and out.

That’s absurd. Under the current system, if a newspaper website wants to increase its ABC traffic figure, it is being encouraged to appeal to the one-off visitor from anywhere in the world. Once someone has visited the website once, they cease to be of any value for the rest of the month so there is no point in trying to cultivate a loyal community of local readers.

Or maybe Nintendo wants a bigger challenge. A global reboot of the series could be lucrative. Taking Genius Sonority or maybe even Retro Studios and getting them to rebuild each game from the ground up in breath taking 720p HD for the WiiU. Each release would be a full blown remake with the graphical style of the cancelled Mother 64. The games would use the tablet and other WiiU features, cards and NFC toys could be sold or given out as gifts (Club Nintendo/Pre- order). The remakes would not require massive effort on Shigesato or his team because all of the ground work would already be in place. The games would be massive hits in Japan selling millions and in North America and Europe combined probably a good million or more copies life time.

A night out drinking with friends can get pretty costly, pretty quickly. You saddle up to the bar. She buys the first round of drinks. You buy the second round of drinks. Somewhere after the fourth or fifth round, you've lost count of whose turn it is to buy drinks. With a little liquid courage, you catch yourself saying "screw it" and now you're buying everyone in your group a round of drinks. If it's happy hour prices, then your generosity wont hurt your wallet too bad. But happy hour only lasts for a couple of hours until the drinks go back to full price.

However, about an hour before the NPIP representative arrived, our son went to change the chickens’ water, and six of them slipped out the door. The three kids and I had a heck of a time chasing them down. Free range means no fences, and lots of places for them to hide, squeeze under, and run through. It also means that trying to entice them back into the coop with grain doesn’t work well, because there are lots of other, more tasty things to sample out in the woods. However, after a bit of running, diving, and even climbing the compost pile, we managed to get our escapees back into the coop. Unfortunately, I hadn’t anticipated the exercise, and so I have no pictures to share. They would’ve been worth sharing!

barney rosset, the publisher of grove press and evergreen review, died tuesday night at the age of 89. rosset, through his publications and actions, was at the forefront of the fight against censorship during the 1950's and 1960's. by way of a single example, rosset was instrumental in bringing henry miller's work to the american public. it was grove press that first published "tropic of cancer" in the united states, and then underwrote the legal fees incurred throughout the country to defend it against charges of obscenity - and culminated in a landmark legal victory in the supreme court.

It is clear from his use of the passage that Paul understood “placing all things under Christ’s feet” to mean rulership. Why should that not be the case, since after his resurrection, Jesus explicitly stated that he had been given “all authority in heaven and on earth.” When Jesus was born, the angel Gabriel said that he would be given the throne of David his forefather, and that he would reign forever. So it would be most natural for the apostles to understand his post-resurrection words to mean that he was reigning as their king, even if the way in which he was to rule turned out to be different from what they expected. The psalmist’s statement that he was to reign in the midst of his enemies is consistent with the idea that his rulership expands until, by the end of his reign, all things are under his feet. A great
The shoe-gazing that she refers to, which she feels has been indulged by beer writers like myself, are often actually high publicity projects that pay dividends for breweries and the writer alike.

It’s sometimes difficult to appreciate events in history unless you were there. We know the stories handed down to us from tradition, or the media, or a textbook, but the distance tends to numb us to the situation, especially when our world is built on the results of those events. This can be seen in something like the Declaration of Independence. For Americans, who have grown up in the land of the free, we may know about the American Revolution, because we grew up here. We grew up without the monarchy, in a system of government that was formed at the time of the Revolution and has for us been the “way it’s always been”. For those who lived during the Revolution, it must have been very different, a big leap of faith, conflict between those who were still loyal to England and those who wanted independence, setting up a constitution for a new nation, a lot of trial and error and of course a big war to fight to gain it all.

The way this has manifested, unfortunately, is that our representatives rarely take on the controverial challenges before them, preferring instead the symbolic over the substantial and the partisan over the compromise. It’s safer to know your audience and always meet their expectations, pandering to the whim of the moment, than it is to do the hard work of the marathon negotiation over party lines. If you have several days to meet, discuss, negotiate, linger over lunch and drinks, shake a few hands, and make a few deals before the public has caught on to a particular issue…enough to understand it in any real way, you can get some quality work done. When every moment is potentially broadcast to the chattering masses, with opinions of all stripes bombarding the channels, and factions organizing for *and* against the same issue at the drop of a hat, it’s next to impossible to get anything done and come out as a viable candidate for re-election. Anyway, it would take a person of distinctively strong will and conviction to rise above the fray, but, as they say, it takes two to tango (or 60 to break a filibuster in the Senate) and so we have gridlock.
However, in response, we see David do two things. First, he retreats to his stronghold. It is a place of protection. It is a quiet place. Second, he inquires of God. It is here that he inquires of God for the strategy to defeat his enemy. God reveals it to him and he goes on to defeat the Philistines. In fact, David NEVER lost a battle because he learned to inquire of God for the strategy to defeat his enemies.

Of course, I realize that my habit of holding folks at arm's length dissuades good people from making the moves to get to know me better, I've even heard that I'm seemingly inaccessible and uninterested, so folks don't bother because of it. Does that bum me out? Sure it does, but I don't know how to change it. Better alone and in peace than throwing the door open and having a headache that lasts a lifetime.

The IPCC, formed in 1989, is the high church of global warming. It pretends to be a scientific body but is actually a political lobby group campaigning to promote climate alarm. To understand how the IPCC has corrupted science and fooled the public, you can do no better than read a new book, Delinquent Teenager, by Donna Laframboise, an investigative journalist. She likens the IPCC to a spoilt teenager — indulged, never criticised, given large amounts of money, fawned upon and so corrupted.

What I argued then at a time when awareness of PC was just starting to grow in the United Kingdom has been well and truly vindicated. How else are we to explain the fact that a senior British judge can attack the British police both in the twisted language of, and on the terms set by, Neo-Marxists and other enemies of the West? While one could argue that all is not well in the police, all is certainly not as bad as Macpherson and his hordes of special-interest advisers would have us believe. The real target of the Macpherson Report is Britain itself and this includes the naive judge who lent his name to this disgraceful document.

If instead Leo were the first house, then the owner of Leo – the Sun – would own the first house. If Capricorn were rising, Saturn would own the first house. The second house would be Aquarius, so Saturn would also own that house. Jupiter would own the third, Pisces. Mars the fourth, Aries, etc.
Couple of things or ground rules. I suck and spelling and my grammer is probably going to be full of

5. Curb Your Enthusiasm
A final point requiring addressing by the country. The issue of teacher allocations. I was talking to an education insider who indicated that schools in urban areas always end up having about two times of the number of teachers they need while schools in remote areas are perpetually understaffed. This has to do with decisions made by District Education Officers who are always besieged with orders to transfer so and so to urban areas by politicians, businessmen, fellow civil servants etc. Now that government at the County level is here, perhaps the time has come for Education Officers to publish reports by schools showing total student enrollment, number of teachers and pupil to teacher ratios. Then benchmark standards can be put up and all those schools (and County’s) not compliant need to explain otherwise their funding is cut off.
Is this what Canada stands for now?
In today's Age, critic Cameron Woodhead buys into the recent controversy around Shit on Your Play. For once, a sensible, informed piece about theatre blogging in the mainstream press. As he points out:
Nowadays people flirt with others for shits and giggles. That means that just b/c someone is flirting with you doesn’t always means they really have an interest. Sometimes a certain setting simply calls for people being openly flirtatious with others even if they have no real interest. And many times outsiders who flirt with those already taken are not doing it b/c they really DESIRE that taken person necessarily, but many times they are doing it from a self-satisfaction standpoint to see if they can simply cause a man or woman to do the ultimate swipe to their SO by flirting back with them.
I need to exercise more. My bday was 2 months ago so I can't blame anything on the celebrations.
Have a Blessed weekend
Window and door frames are thermally efficient aluminium, and the scheme incorporates mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) which when combined with the highly efficient woodburning stove in the main living space, means that Tom and Emily rarely need any additional heating, even in winter.
I do not like fake people or rude people...
A shark, you would think, would be the last place one would look for advice. I mean, they're vicious, and ruthless, and the only way they can communicate with you is by biting you. Not the best teachers, right?
NB Harissa is widely available in France, but it seems to come in huge industrial sized containers. As this marinade needs only a teaspoonful of Harissa, I bring my own favourite brand from England. It doesn't take up that much space in the car.

Obama pledged to support “every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs,” perhaps making him the only person in America who didn’t read the New York Times story over the weekend about how Apple’s products are all built in Asia.
They would still love you so.
My fans! They are passionate and the emails I receive definitely inspires me to write more books. When I get an email saying a teen hated to read but because of my books now loves to read is amazing and surreal. When readers say that reading one of my books has inspired them to write their own book, it’s the coolest feeling! When someone says they look at people differently and don’t judge them because my books taught them you can’t judge someone by the color of their skin or their social status, I love that!

I was really excited for awhile about all that. To a lesser extent, I still am! But I've realized there's a huge downside.
I realize now that stasis (in a Greek philosophical sense) has always been important to me, but I didn't know what to call it until I was introduced to Giovanni Bellini's St Francis in Ecstasy and the study of ontology in high school. I could write a tome about this painting, but I will attempt to resist in this post, and save that for later.
In mid 2009 I said to the Deputy Chairman that things had to change because key activists’ complaints were falling on deaf ears and if this continued I would have difficulty in retaining the whip at the GLA, because these issues had to be addressed. At the same time, rumours were passing around that I would be deselected to stand for the Barking parliamentary seat. As it turned out, the rumours proved true, and it came to light in the winter of 2009 that I would not be selected to stand for the constituency of Barking again and that some one would be parachuted in from outside London. This approach was also to take place in Stoke, Thurrock and other key strongholds, with local activist candidate hopefuls being replaced by outsiders with no links or affiliation with the constituencies in which they were to stand. Yet another ingredient was being stirred in to the mix in the recipe for disaster!

In the meantime, our silent couple is having fun washing some sheets with their feet.
so, why the ode to bagels? (as if i would need a reason…) well, for starters, i’m pretty sure i’ve eaten almost as many in the past month or so as i did during my first years in san francisco… and yes, sometimes i’ve had one for breakfast and dinner. but i’m especially loving them right now because they seem to be the only things that absolutely make the sickies go away.

Have a photo excursion planned on Sunday in Downtown to capture the September 11th Memorial activity. I imagine an emotion filled day.
Two places had been set with their good china, cloth napkins, and sparkling crystal goblets. Jenny had never done more than get him a card before, and after three months of her withholding sex, he really hadn't expected this.
Matt took me to Mt. High a couple weeks ago to check out my new pseudo-carving skills. It was a beautiful, sunny, 60-degree day on which my coat lasted about 3 minutes before finding its way back to the car. The view from the top of the mountain was lovely, and the company was even better. It's so nice to spend quality time with Matt (many thanks to the Rozsas for babysitting Jake!).
We need more collaboration with our technical colleges to better match training with careers that are in demand. That’s difficult to do when we’ve cut $71 million from the state’s technical colleges. Western Technical College has a waiting list of students wanting to get into the welding programs. Local companies need more welders, which are better- than-average paying jobs.
Statues are stylised and used to convey various human qualities. Military heroes say, were shown in proud and honourable poses that suggested authority, fortitude, steadfastness such as Lord Nelson's famous column in Trafalgar Square. They were cast in forms that conveyed meaning but contemporary public art fails in that elementary intention as the meaning is disjunctured.
It is a rape of the life built together. Of family. Of emotional bonds. Of marital vows.
Which is why there will be no more turning of blind eyes from me, or resigned shrugs. We need someone speaking for all of London, not just the Balkanised segments whose votes he craves.

I'm really excited to say that White Crow is now available as an enhanced e-reader. Not only that, but it has the honour of being the very first enhanced e-reader that Orion have published. For a pound more than the physical book, punters can buy it for iPad, Kindle and Sony e-reader, and get a bunch of extra material, for example, a photo gallery, which not only contains photos of the village of Dunwich which inspired the book, but also things like pages from my notebook, an example of which is shown here.

I guessed Käthe's secret long before I think I was supposed to--certainly well before Alan figured it out--but that didn't ruin the story for me at all. Even though, as Elvis put it, "the imagery and omens became almost oppressively obvious" as the story went on, the climactic scene where Alan's fears are confirmed was still spine-chilling enough for me even though it wasn't a surprise. This is a book that definitely reached "critical mass", and that's always welcome.
Once I had gotten past the purloined chocolates, I noticed something that looked suspiciously like hair on the floor. It was fine, blonde hair, and it was more than a few hairs that had fallen out due to brushing. Upon examination of my tiny daughter’s head, I discovered that she had decided to give herself bangs.

Michael Dunnagan can’t blame Annie for her anger, because he feels it too. Why would God save a street rat while a good man like Owen died? Bound by a promise to Owen, Michael is determined to make Owen’s aunt and uncle’s farm a success and bring Annie to America.
I have to mention that Totally Twisted is also what changed my jewelry designs from basic stringing to include wire - Kerry's book demonstrates how easily it is to enhance any design!
In an after-dinner red wine haze, I was idly flicking through the 962 digital TV channels in an anonymous hotel room in an anonymous Italian town when I came across the radio station channels And amidst a blizzard of EuroPop stations with the DJs in constant fits of hysterical laughter even as they hand over to the weather forecaster I found this little gem.
But mixing it up is good. I own several 'masculines' or borderlines, and while there are times when even wearing Jicky makes you feel as though you're sporting Y-fronts and talking in a deep voice, no one else will guess your secret. Sartorial begins as a very proper cologne, which gradually, like the FT, lets slip a winning touch of individuality, even eccentricity, as you get to know it better. It features unusual-sounding ingredients such as 'ozonic effect'; 'metallic effect' and 'old wood effect'. Personally, I'm getting a hint of that door-opening whoosh and a bit of steam iron too. In other words, it's like opening a drawer and finding a perfectly laundered crisp shirt, which yet retains a whiff of the beloved's scent. A perfect memento of my happy time spent among the 'suits'.
That's when I decided to use my new Twistable Crayola Crayons and Colored Pencils! I created two NEW pencil boxes that contain a mechanical pencil, glue stick, eraser, scissors, and twistable crayons and colored pencils. How do the kiddos get to USE these special boxes? They have to earn it through producing NICE and NEAT work! The "My Work Rocks!" BOX will be theirs to use for one day, along with a little award to take home and share with their parents. I am guessing that their friends at the table will be "jealous" enough to try and earn the box for themselves.
Just saying, and that’s my Thought Provoking Perspective…
In 2006, the Chinese wanted to use their dollars to do something other than buy Treasuries.
So - hypothetically speaking, of course - if someone wanted to scare off the beasts, what would work? Suppressed .22 (to avoid scaring the White Folks)? Crossbow (arguably not illegal hereabouts)? Game cam with built-in flash attachment?
Undoubtedly the period of greatest danger was 1994-1999 with Mandela's popularity at its zenith. In that period the ANC found many white admirers and members, often well-educated and well-connected folk so that a new sort of pro-ANC political correctness was very much in vogue at dinner party tables. Thabo Mbeki and Essop Pahad repeatedly tried to pull the press into an alliance with the government.

We had a gossip and a bitch and I forgot about my annoyance - until the starters arrived. The waiter minced up to us and placed three plates in all the wrong places. Jodie tutted and swapped them around. I looked at my potted shrimp and knew, before I even tasted it that it would be disgusting. Wrapped in thick, transparent gelatine the prawns were huge. I picked all the jelly off and prodded one of the pink monsters before forking the thing. I gagged as it hit my tongue. Cold, tasteless – it hung in my mouth like a watery fibroid. I swallowed it quickly to stop the rising bile. That wasn’t potted shrimp. Potted shrimp has a delicious pâté quality to it; a buttery melt in your mouth-ness, all studded

An Italian meringue is the most stable meringue. It is made by heating a sugar syrup to the soft-ball stage, 232°F to 240°F, then beating the hot syrup into the egg whites. Adding butter to the finished meringue makes it buttercream frosting.

8) The prophets foretold that Christ would be the Stone rejected by the builders. Matthew 21:42. Luke 20:17. Psalm 118:22. David wrote that Christ would be raised from the dead to sit on David’s throne. Acts 2:27-32. Now, carefully note the prophecy of Amos in 9:11-15. Christ, here, is to build again the tabernacle of David, and save Israelites and Gentiles. This is the program of Acts 15:13-18.
Conference organizer Nagib Callaos reportedly told Reuters that the paper was one of a small number accepted on a "non-reviewed" basis. "We thought that it might be unfair to refuse a paper that was not refused by any of its three selected reviewers. The author of a non-reviewed paper has complete responsibility of the content of their paper."
This decision stresses the need to strike a fair balance between several rights and interests, ruling that copyright does not have a superior rank vis-à-vis the right of ISPs to freely conduct business as well as the right of their customers to protect personal data and receive or impart information.

Either with devotion or hatred, with faith or with reason everyone in this country and interested in this country is chanting the name of Sri Rama, and gathering at the very minimum the yogic benefits of the same.
The Husband often talks about how the kids have inherited both the very best of us and the very worst of us. Obviously the worst being mainly from him, but I like to play along by suggesting that The Tweenager gets his stubbornness from me and, erm, perhaps The Toddler's self-centredness might be a teenie bit me too.

But mixing papers is a lot of fun and it gives you a more unique look to your pages. It is really about now getting frustrated or dismissive about being able to mix the lines. Just sit down and look about BOTH sides of the papers with your photos and you would be surprised about what works together!

Moving on, I came across Chez Hanna. There was a small group of people at the window, which seemed to be moving pretty briskly. This time I noticed pretty quickly that everyone had a receipt in their hand. I put two and two together and went inside to order and get my ticket, then returned outside to wait in another (thankfully quick) line for the sandwich. Finally.

Every Sunday, I can usually be found in the kitchen making muffins. I like to bake up a batch of muffins and have them handy as snacks, or for Mr.B's lunch box during the week. My go to recipe is usually contains bananas, but now and then I like to switch it up. Once again my friend Susan from Mom's Recipe Collection posted the most delicious looking muffins, last week. I knew right away I wanted to make them and jotted down the recipe. Well, Sunday morning rolled around and as I was making breakfast, I discovered that my strawberries were getting ready to turn. Not wanting to waste them, I decided to add them to Susan's muffin recipe, rather than cranberries.
They hype products tied to idiotic, overexposed "celebrities." I have written about my waistline issues but why would I give a slutty Kardashian about what type of girdle one of those reality show harlots wears to squeeze in her post-baby belly? Especially without sending me an actual slutty Kardashian to model it for me. (Note to that marketing agency: I'm partial to this one, especially in this saucy pirate outfit:

Obama and his crew have allegedly done some shady, illegal, underhanded things in the last several years but this is the one, as the author of the article, Peter Ferrara, so well illustrates. The President, who fancies himself unable to do wrong has placed himself and his partners in this debacle in a position that is without an avenue of escape and contains no absolutely no merit. It is an issue that will not be forgotten and will be followed to conclusion, I suggest even by some in his own Party for no other reason than self preservation.
Are multiculti ads, then, an accurate barometer of our racial progress, a showcase of our hopes in that direction — or a reminder of how far we still have to go?''
This Saturday I wanted to watch the FA Cup Final with some friends in Edinburgh so a walk in or around Edinburgh seemed a sensible choice. I therefore looked up the extremely useful Beercast Edinburgh Beer Weekly, found out that the Blue Goose on Lanark Road was having a May Day Weekend Beer Festival and decided I could work in a walk from Colington in the South-West of Edinburgh to the City Centre, around a visit to the Blue Goose.
I made myself be busy for the past 2 days (since I didn’t have any sub jobs)… 4 loads of laundry, grocery store for 3 mega-meals, and I made a crock-pot roast. I asked an Okie friend to come over and occupy me, as well.
