I am tired of the system that only allows us to be successful if we have a good job, a new car, a big house. I am tired of the system that places value on wilderness only in terms of how much wealth it will create if we destroy it. I am tired of the system that encourages foreign companies to explore off our shores for oil to keep that system running, while at this very moment the oil gushes unhindered into the sea of my homeland, just as it has for years in the seas of other nations whose citizens skins are not the same colour as mine. For some reason it seems to mean more in places where the people it most affects are white. I am tired of that too.

I've ignored some big names. Tony Curtis comes to mind. Just never enough for me to honor him. It's not that he was a bad actor. In fact, he could be a very good one. It's just that his costars (Sidney Poitier, Burt Lancaster, Cary Grant, Jack Lemmon, Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Henry Fonda, and ex-wife Janet Leigh) always seemed to pique my interest a lot more.
The danger (where there is any) from armed citizens, is only to the *government*, not to *society*; and as long as they have nothing to revenge in the government (which they cannot have while it is in their own hands) there are many advantages in their being accustomed to the use of arms, and no possible disadvantage. - Joel Barlow, "Advice to the Privileged Orders", 1792-93

It's psychology 101.

I bought this cute dress for a wedding that Kyle and I have to attend in September. I couldn’t pass it up! It was only 25 bucks!
When you buy celery at a produce market like this one, the stalk comes with twenty feet of leaves sticking out the top. It's large and unwieldy and it's often tough to keep your celery under control. There was an elderly woman in front of me who was also buying celery. When it came her turn to pay, the man offered to chop the leaves off before he weighed it. I'd never seen that before! Hey, that's great!
Another delicious way to get your serving of milk in is to make a chocolate milkshake! Are you hungry yet? Take three scoops of chocolate ice cream, half cup of milk and as much chocolate syrup as your little heart desires and blend away in less than 10 minutes.
For this you'll need: Cloth first-aid tape (I use Johnson's and Johnson's), nonstick craft sheet (you can use parchment paper in a pinch if you don't have the sheet), stencil, copic markers, copic abs and Panpastels.
What's the craziest writing idea you've had?
Is there anything I would do differently? I think so. The pattern instructions said to sew the whole thing using zig zag stitch and skip straight stitch altogether. However, jersey fabric puckers easily, and in order to avoid that, you need to use largest possible stitch. I’m feeling very uncertain about the strength of the large zig zag on its own. Thankfully J. is so small that he’s still fairly gentle with his clothing (and it seems that this hoodie is not going to fit him too long… It’s just the right size now!) but if I make him another one (the pattern goes up to 5-year-old size) I’ll probably use the straight stitch as well even though that’s going to take longer.

However, I live in town. One of the big reasons why I won’t wait in line to eat during a fair or festival is that I can eat at our restaurants anytime I like. Most of our visitors do not live here in town. They get hungry or want to do some shopping. There are only so many exhibits you can look at. Not everyone wants to choke down an elephant ear or pizza that’s made in a trailer. Those folks fill up the restaurants. If they didn’t, there would be places to sit.
THE Q and A is in 3 parts. This is our higher education at work, dedicated to creating and maintaining a brain-dead generation incapable of thinking for themselves. They proudly marched in lock-step with the Islamic Fascisti and their Marxist comrades. Fools and tools. Surly and smug as they lectured the speakers.

The native Americanum is now offered for sale at an area nursery; its mottled foliage is interesting, though not as big and glossy as the “Pagoda.” For crazy spring foliage though, you really can’t beat tulipa gregii, which is intertwined with the erythronium here.

Then, just a month or so ago (maybe a bit more), PBS was scheduled to air a production of Hamlet starring David Tennant, an actor whom I adore. So, along with Emilie and a friend, both of whom also happen to adore David Tennant, we settled down to watch.
The word “Diamonds” and “forever” became forever linked in our culture. And what is even more remarkable…the way they positioned themselves as a benchmark of love, they reversed the dire trends. Diamonds were more valuable than ever.

The last book to arrive was Couture Sewing Techniques. This book has been on my wish list for awhile but I decided to finally order it after reading Lauren's review. It's a great review of a really fabulous book, check it out! This book gives a brief history of Haute Couture and the illustrations of sewing techniques included are very clear. The colored photographs are great examples of the techniques described. The sewing tips in this book can be applied to sewing projects of any time period.

Creating confusion is one thing but the study also shows that customers will often END UP NOT BUYING YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE! You want the cherry on top? Probably not, but I’m going to give it to you anyway: the customers that end up making a purchase when confronted with a large number of choices are LESS SATISFIED WITH THEIR PURCHASES!!

Now we were somewhere that looked like it was between terminals, more like a small parking area.

The mode of action of a pesticide is also important. A pesticide is either (1.) ingested by the insect by eating it (2.) by grooming itself and ingesting it or (3.) dermal penetrating or soaking through its cuticle – its skin. Well, this is exactly where the problem of control comes up. Bedbugs suck blood, so they don’t have a way to (1.) Ingest a pesticide (2.) they do not groom them selves very often and don’t have the opportunity for ingesting the pesticide and lastly (3.) their exoskeleton (cuticle or skin) is thicker than most insects and the class of products that we have available does not dermally penetrate the skin.

However, my latest reading has made me very happy. You can’t complain about the book where the title of the first chapter is “Why it is hard to meet an average French person”. After reading several books on interviewing techniques (not that they were not interesting because three out of the four were!), a book that appears to teach one how to be French as a means of explaining the culture is amazing! And by amazing, I mean amusing… And I also have no idea why I’m reading this book.
“One of the stronger correlates of growth was the extent to which the congregation ‘has a clear mission and purpose.’ For congregations that have such an orientation, growth is quite likely, but for those that do not, very few are growing.”
I’d heard some negative comments about this one and for sure it’s not what you’d expect from Sierra Nevada in terms of taste and style, however in the area of quality and taste, it’s the typical top notch product most of us have come to expect from the Sierra Nevada crew. I’ll try it again.

And what shall I say of the most Holy Father, the pope? Is it not true that he and his bishops have become worldly lords, have fallen away from the Gospel, led by the spirit of lies, and embraced their own human doctrine, and thus have practiced murder, down to the present hour? Read the histories of the time and you find that the principal business of popes and bishops has been to set emperors, kings, princes, lands, and people against one another, even themselves to fight and help in the work of murder and bloodshed. Why so? Because the spirit of lies never acts any other way.
I don't think that we've really had a moment to breathe. When I think back, since June it's been one thing after another.

We've been hoping for a time where he is able to feel a little more like himself, where physically he has freedoms that he once had.

I really enjoyed Texeira's artwork on this one. He has a very cinematic style and he's not afraid to draw large crowds of people and the folks that he presents do each have their own stylings (facial scars, clothes, hairstyles). When I first read this I was a little miffed at how quickly Jonah took to navigating a motorcycle, but now I see that there is some wobbling depicted in the artwork. I did like that Jonah is having to re-learn who/what is right and wrong in this new world and through no fault of his own he threw in with the wrong bunch.

This weekend, my mother asked me to wheel her into her bedroom where she rummaged through dresser drawers. She wanted me to have a bracelet. She had already let my sister choose one and there were two others that she wanted to give away. Two of them, delicately crafted, she said she had spent a great deal of money on (one of them my sister had already chosen) and had thought at the time she would one day give them to her girls. The third one was multi-colored glass. She said she had bought this one as a present for herself a very long time ago, just after my father had died. That was the one I was attracted to. She said she will give the third bracelet to my sister’s partner. I put the bracelet on and have not yet taken it off. I really should. The colored glass beads might break. My mother wanted to make sure the clasp was secured tightly before I left.

Conclusion and a Note on Origins
On to my dog, she did amazing at the trainers yesterday, she walked along side of me, she sat after some practice. The trainer has a lot of faith in her, she says that she has seen many pit bulls be challenged and they kill because it is in their nature. She was telling me a lot about the signs to look for and how to stop it. It was really interesting. I am so glad that she has some faith in my dog, many people are scolding me for not having her put down. Deciding to rehabilitate the dog was a harder decision in my opinion, because I was so angry at her for doing what she did. She is a good dog, she wants to please people. She knew she did wrong, she has barely touched any food for over a week now. The day before yesterday I had to bribe her to eat, I poured a can of beef broth and put some canned chicken in her food. She was so hungry she ended up eating the entire bowl of food. I have faith in my dog, I think she will do well!
Being “not normal” is not a bad thing. It’s a God thing. From my faith, my hunger for Him, the way I raise my family, where I stand on many issues, where my passion for the Kingdom is at, why I do what I do for the reasons I do it…nothing is normal. And I’m quite content that way. Knowing that I am so different is actually comforting to me. Fitting in to the status quo is being a fish out of water for me. I can’t survive in the net of normal.

Eastwood’s performance of Harry Callahan is one that everyone knows about. His famous quote of “do you feel lucky” never fails to induce cheers from its viewers (again, no matter where they happen to stand politically/morally on the issue of violence). He’s a character that thrives on the pain of the criminal. The even more famous quote, “go ahead, make my day,” from the fourth Dirty Harry movie, Sudden Impact (and often wrongfully assigned to the original 1971 film), gives us even more insight into the character: here’s a character, a cop mind you, that enjoys the dirtiest aspects of his job; it would make his day for you to interrupt his hot dog and allow him to shoot you should you try to shoot him first (that kind of humor wouldn't really be introduced until Sudden Impact).

We put a lot of time and attention into this exercise, and every student’s session was interesting and enlightening. Every one was unique, too. A number of us were (apparently) dealing with the same entities, with Michael being popular as usual. I noticed that the tone of “my” Michael was different from the Michael brought through by other people, and that their versions were different from each other. I wonder, of course, whether we are all really in contact with the same entity, and whether we are accurately hearing from whoever that may be. Perhaps it’s not strange at all that our own personalities color the interactions and the messages. I do know that when I’ve spoken with other fans of Michael, they have described someone very much like the being I perceive.

You know, the most profound messages usually come from children. They don’t use big, complicated words, but what they say will have you thinking well after the conversation. Don’t fake it, people. Keep it simple. Allow the characters’ actions and their decisions within the story to determine whether they are smart. Show, don’t tell.
I think the yarn I use most of - in number of projects certainly - is the sock yarn from Regia. It's a 75% wool/25% nylon mix to make it hardwearing, and it's nice and smooth to work with. But it's not the texture I love it for, it's the colours, especially in the Kaffe Fassett range. They are vivid and rich (mostly) without being too tacky and bright (again, mostly) and they make the funkiest socks which have kept my feet nice and snug during our "coldest winter for numpty nine years" ... I'm also quite keen on Opal sock yarn ... and - well, quite a few others, but for practically and enjoyment at a relatively reasonable price, it's the Regia for me...

A life forced to walk a path that’s wrong.
The paperback edition below was published by Pocket Books in 1983.
I didn't say anything, just followed Marge down the road and feeling panicked and caught for breath. As we walked I kept asking Marge the question in my head but could never get it out. It seemed like a pointless thing to do. Marge would only deny it further. Finally I did ask, just as he made his excuse to turn off down a road which took him in the opposite direction to where he was going.
As they get tangled in the sparks of desire and passion you wonder how their situation will be resolved. There are several heavy passion scenes but it all moves pretty quickly to the inevitable confrontations. The characters and dialogue are fun and the story is engaging to the end. I enjoyed the history of gin distilleries as part of the story. The author does a wonderful job weaving the story and characters and this is a book and author I can definitely recommend.
He also invited anti-graft NGOs like the Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW) and Transparency International’s Indonesian branch to monitor the program implementation.
As a kid, in Guthrie, Oklahoma, I’d try to wait up for my dad to get home. He’d make it in just after 10 pm, wake me, and we’d meet me in the living room to watch Doctor Who on PBS. That was my first timeless character, the first time my head filled with ideas about other worlds and histories long forgotten. Sure there was a lot of running and screaming, but there was a robot dog, and I came to love the series and stuck with it on public television through much of my childhood.
A World I Never Made is ostensibly a story about a father and daughter finding each other in the wake of the new age of terrorism. Pat Nolan flies to France to identify the body of his daughter, Megan, only to discover that she faked her suicide. He teams up with a female policeofficer to track down the real Megan, while a parallel narrative taking place a year earlier slowly unveils how Megan found herself in such a desperate situation.

It has never been more important for companies to hold on to their employees. A high turnover of staff is a waste of valuable time and resources, as money is spent on recruitment and training. In the current climate companies need to do all they can to minimise this waste by holding on to their high performing individuals. So what is the best way to retain the talent in your business?
An activist is someone who engages in activism. Activism is defined as “a policy of taking direct and often militant action to achieve an end.” Should Christians be political activists? This is really something that one needs to pray about, seeking godly biblical counsel, and looking at every side of the issue.

This type of group makes sense to me since, I often would like to add more artists to SpookyTimeJingles but cannot due to size constraints. When a marketplace gets too large in size it causes the viewer to lose interest because their is too much content to take in. Hence the reason for our 6+month wait list to join us plus we just do not have a lot of turnover.
In the first century, Paul would have answered these questions with a story something like this. We are the people of God, put here in this world to worship God and enjoy the goodness of his creation. But the world has become corrupted by sin and we are unable to fulfill that destiny. The solution to the problem is to be found in the death and resurrection of Jesus. The last question is therefore critical – where are we in God’s plan of redemption? For Paul, a new age has begun with Jesus – a radically different new age has already dawned when Jesus rose from the dead (Fresh Perspective, 6, 9).

Notice that Mary, the mother of Jesus was there and joining them in prayer. They were not praying to her or through her. She was one of them, of the same mind. She was in need, as they were in need. She had not gone into heaven. She was no different than the other women. Who else was there? The brothers of Jesus were also there. In Matthew13:55we learn that the brothers of Jesus were James, Jude, Simon, and Joseph. Two of these half brothers of Jesus are of special note. James became the moderator of the great Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 and Jude was the human writer of the letter that bears his name in the New Testament. Up until this time they were noted for their unbelief but now after the resurrection, they were joining the rest in prayer. What is the importance of this prayer? I believe that all prayer acknowledges our insufficiency and worships God. It is a form of worship, praise and submission when we humble ourselves with bowed head before our Lord and Saviour. These disciples were powerless, facing a monumental task. They knew their only hope was in the risen Lord. Thus it is with us also as they Lord does His work in our hearts. The disciples were worshipping God through prayer but they would also have been beseeching God in behalf of one another. True prayer is “others centred” and when you pray for your enemies they no longer are your enemies. They would also have been praying for the Jewish nation that they would accept the Messiah.

His mission is pretty straightforward: Locate a group of fertile women who have been kidnapped by an unruly gang of rebel greeners ("greeners" are what the humans call the frog people), rescue them from hostile mutant territory, and then, if he's still got any energy left, impregnate them. Accompanying him to make sure everything goes smoothly is Spangle and Centinella (Cec Verrell), a tough chick who seems most at ease while wielding the M-60 machine gun that is poking out from the top of their pink Medtech ambulance. The whole urination issue I alluded to earlier tests Spangle and Sam's relationship almost immediately, as he tries to make a run for it while pretending to take a piss. As he's making his escape, Sam feels a sharp pain in his groin. It would seem that Medtech have booby-trapped his crotch. The white earrings affixed to Spangle's earlobes are more than just a bold fashion statement, they also control and monitor the chastity belt. One earring is a proximity sensor (it sends a mild shock through the wearers genitals), while the other is a directional finder (a beeping sound helps Spangle locate the cherished privates whenever they go missing).

Remember how I said I did the knicks at different points in the shape? Well that backfired a little. See it's really hard to get all 3 shapes exactly the same. So I was left with a bend that the wires didn't quite bend all at the same point, and I couldn't really fix it at this point. It's not the end of the world, but just something to keep in mind. Once it's wrapped in jute it doesn't really show, it's just wider at that point.
Well after not receiving my ticket for Saturdays game against Bristol City there was bit of a mad panic to pick up my tickets pre match although saying that I just walked up to the window that had my Surname detailed, not sure why 100's queued up behind A-E unless they are are all in that range, personally I guess they love the English way of queuing.
The first time I read about anything being purposefully burned in Mauritania, beneath that scorching desert sun, it was from 2009, and the prescription medicines that the government destroyed because they were out of date or illegally imported pseudo-meds, in both cases highly dangerous. They had a bonfire, same as the little springtime ceremonies in Nouadhibou, where police torch impressive quantities of illicit drugs captured from the well-established trafficking routes. The drugs trade bonfires are likely timed to coincide with a visit by representatives of a source of international funding for the prevention of trafficking.
Fear goes deeper. Fear takes your hand and leads you into labyrinth, where hope is lost. Fear is the voice in your ear, saying ”You know you’re not really a writer, right?”. Fear is the tug at your mind that pulls you back from sleep, telling you they’re going to find out you’re really a fraud. Fear is the constant unwanted ally that finds something else, anything else for you to do other than writing. Fear is the gut-churning possibility that… you’re not really good enough. That your words will never make it to the page as vibrant and alive as they are inside your head.

4. Run With The Pack
So at my sister’s place, when it came time to sit down and eat, I chose white turkey meat, one meat ball, a small piece of ham and some mashed potatoes. I decided it was best to take two Imodium after just a couple of mouthfuls. I only ate about half of what I put on my plate because, it’s best that I quit eating as soon as I get the slightest feeling of being full. It must have been the right amount because I was able to stay out of the bathroom till this morning. After dinner, I politely said no to any drinks and just sipped on water.
On Saturday I had the berry, strawberry and vanilla yoghurts with Astros, Oreos, hundreds and thousands and chocolate sprinkles.
Prebius: um no
My friend Sue had asked me to make cookie favors for a baby shower that she was hosting, and we decided that onesies and teddy bears would be perfect. I ended up making three batches of my favorite sugar cookie recipe from "Pretty Party Cakes" - this made about 60 cookies, since she needed 24 favors and each favor would have one of each cookie, and I always make extra to allow for mess-ups!

It's an -ism. I totally admit that.
All the while, though, I have interspersed it with my mobile phone camera, with the latest being the trusted NOKIA E63. While the shots could be a bit sharper, I want to today thank Nokia for creating such a snazzy phone that makes pictures that much different from a classic stand-alone camera of 10/12/14 megapixels!;-)
The story is not bad, I suppose. I enjoyed the book and some parts were fairly entertaining and light enough to read quickly but I've discovered that I certainly do not like the mean-type characters (why do I still want to read Before I Fall?). I'm such a big character-driven reader and writer that any time I face a character I cannot relate to, I'm not as invested in the story.
Therefore, you can get the fast food version in the West and experience it momentarily. But can you keep it? Can you value it? The Western approach is hit or miss, it’s the wild west — it’s a disorganized Disneyland of nondual teachers, groups, and institutions.
In the past year, all 6 of my girls are out of the home in the mornings.
So many of the characters in the book and Hannah’s experiences are based on real events and people. Like, one of my rich Russian students told me he thought there was nothing wrong with bringing someone from your country to work in your house and not paying them. He said life was better for them in America, wasn’t it? He was both one of the most generous people I’ve ever met and also one of the most fiercely ambitious. He told me his whole life he wanted a 90210 zip code. He made it into the book.

Schmitt holds that the exception is a fact which recent liberal theorists ("liberal constitutionalists") have tried to wish away. He suggests that only some kind of metaphysical-historical commitment (I'm thinking this means a belief in Whiggish view of progress) would lead one to believe that the exception can be extinguished from governance.
Today is my 12th anniversary working for you-know-who. Wow. When I started this job I was a lot younger, skinnier, and blonder. I was also a lot less bruised by life. I had more energy but less stress. I drove a Mitsubishi that was 1/2 way paid for. I'd just moved back to Austin after being gone for five years, and lived in a rented house with horrible carpet and a man I would marry and divorce. I had lots of free time and saw lots of movies and live music. Everyone was freaking about the Millennium and what it would mean to computer systems around the world. My boss was hoarding bottled water and food in his spare bedroom. I had straight hair and bangs. I had a 401k and a savings account. My parents still lived in Longview, which meant somewhat frequent trips to The Pine Curtain. America was not (technically) at war. I smoked a good deal of pot. I was not a mother to anything other than a Siberian husky and an old, grumpy cat. I'd never been to Wisconsin, Michigan, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Oregon, or New Mexico. I didn't know what "genetically modified organisms" or "organic integrity" meant. My dad and stepfather were still alive. I had no tattoos.
You are certainly not the first generation to get out of college to find that armed with the degree you are going to find that bosses are not standing around to hold the door open for you or to pat you on the back and say what a fine job you did in college. Nothing disappears faster than yesterday when it comes to finding our own futures today and “Nothing is gained when nothing is ventured”,through our own strengths.

So here I am sitting in class wondering what my next post should be about. It’s been kind of hard staying away from sports which is my new goal for the week. As I was struggling one annoying outburst followed by a few more from the same person in this lecture hall sparked this post.
On Saturday, my company once again sponsored a tent at the Virginia Gold Cup. I kind of consider it making up for the fact that I never went to Carolina Cup while I was in college – and it’s always fun to get dressed up, Southern Classy style.

I don't now much about the technical aspects of the approach being taken, but I estimated the spacing of a standard tile side and assumed this: one unit from the first corner to the first entrance; half a unit for the entrance; two units to the next entrance; half a unit for that entrance; one unit to the corner. If this is out, I'd be glad of correction.

During the New York parts of the backstory, the scientific information and environmentalist tirades come to see a little bit heavy-handed in places. In the Nova Scotia sections, on Lily Lake Road, our main character immerses us in the details of living close to the earth, the smells and comforts and difficulties, all while grappling with various griefs. Many of those passages were rich and evocative in detail. I could feel the sun warming the back of my neck, could hear the buzz of flies:

This kit is one of my favorites, I think. Well, for now anyway.. until the next one comes out. ;) I just love this color palette and these MME papers!!! Gorgeousness. This time, I made a LO with an old photo my husband and I found while going through his father's belongings this past summer. I am guessing my father in law wasn't very old. I used the sketch from My Minds Eye.

I fail to see anything in said section that warrants a holding that upon filing his report with Congress, about the rules and regulation promulgated by him under his emergency powers under Commonwealth Act 671, his emergency powers automatically ceased. I could well imagine that under an act of delegation of legislative powers where the President is authorized to perform one single act such as the suspension of the eight-hour labor law under Commonwealth Act No. 494, or the reduction of the expenditures of the executive departments of the National Government by the suspension or abandonment of services, activities or operations of no immediate necessity under Commonwealth Act No. 500, when the President has exercised his delegated authority and made his report to the Assembly as required by said laws, the latter, as well as his delegated authority thereunder automatically ceased, for the simple reason that nothing remains to be performed or done. However, treating of the grant of extensive emergency powers as was done under Commonwealth Acts Nos. 600, 620 and 671 where said laws contemplated many different acts, rules and regulations of varied categories and objectives and to be performed not at one at time or instance but at different times during the existence of the emergency, as the need or occasion arose, there is no reason for the belief or the holding that upon submitting a partial report, the whole law making the delegation including his powers under it automatically ended. The legislature during the emergency might be able to convene and naturally, the President will immediately make his report to it of the rules and regulations promulgated by him up to that time; but if the emergency continued or even became more serious, would it be reasonable to hold that his emergency powers ended right then and there? Would it not be more logical and reasonable to believe that inasmuch as the grant and the exercise of his emergency powers were motivated by and based upon the existence of the emergency and since the emergency continued his work and responsibility were not ended and that his partial report could not possibly affect the continuance of his emergency powers?

A lovely and regal theme played by solo horn is the most memorable part of the music from this series, a series that is best remembered rather than watched again (down to the rather wobbly (by today’s standards) special effects). But the theme stands up much better and is my favourite from Burgon.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy a bit of a gorgeous music! Do let me know what you think and have a fabulous weekend.

Here are a couple of vignettes I did a few years back for a Zombie Pirates of the Black Coast Army. I never completed enough figures for the project to make it to the gaming table and besides my interest in all things GW was on the wane by this point in time.

I had a very short, yet special season as an interim care mom for my adoption agency and got to love on 3 sweet angels until their forever families were found ... Here is a phrase I heard over and over again from people as they would OOOOHHHHH AND AAAAAAAAHHHHHH over these little babies I was holding and it was, "Oh, I could never do that because I wouldn't be able to give them up." ... I can only imagine how often full time foster moms here this and it struck me as odd that people would infer that they LOVE so much greater than a foster mom, so therefore they couldn't do that job ... When in reality it takes the act of SELFLESSNESS to give your life away to a child. To put their need for safety, love, food, and home over the pain that will come when they leave ... And foster parents do this over and over and over again ...

20. In the meantime, the full fruits of Repeal are sweeping the nation at an increasing rate. Long-dry towns in the South (and North) are going wet, ridiculous laws are being repealed (limits on beer strength; draft beer is allowed in Montgomery, Alabama; South Carolina finally gets rid of airline bottles at bars; and the PA case law...how long, O Lord, how long?!), and attitudes are changing (lowering the 21 LDA is being openly discussed for the first time in 20 years). The New Drys are fighting fiercely, and ground is exchanged back and forth, but we're definitely in the fight.
Hope to see a few of you there!!

They recommended standing up when answering the telephone and walking around while talking. This is much easier to accomplish if you have a portable phone since most phone cords limit your mobility to within five or six feet. Not only can you walk around with your phone at home, you can do the same at your job if you use a speakerphone, which to many people is annoying and crosses the threshold of proper office etiquette.
In the case of the MyData button being promoted by the Education Department, it's not clear how many different types of information will be made available, although the data will exist in machine-readable, open formats.

Convictions don’t mean much when they are silenced.
During my youth every kid in my Riverdale, Maryland neighborhood had a bicycle, and I was no exception. I had lived there since I was four and all my earliest childhood memories originate there. I’m sure I went through three or four bikes during those years, my first being a small Huffy with training wheels, and later upgrading to the most popular of them all, a Schwinn! It was great fun to ride around the neighborhood and quite an adventure to travel several blocks or maybe even a mile or two powered by the spirit of adventure and freedom that a bike provided. I remember my mother was quick to take bike privileges away whenever she felt discipline was needed, and I acquired my share of cuts, scrapes and bruises from those bike riding days. I would often ride until I was exhausted and my body ached all-over.
Now I know I just said that I don't get too hung up on whether a Skyline has a gold plated tip or a plastic tip, since they are so easily interchanged. However, all of these are as I have found them, and I'm seeing a pattern emerge: those which have a partially ribbed barrel have a gold plated tip, and those with a smooth barrel have a plastic tip. It might be a coincidence, but I think these are likely "correct" with the tips as shown (although I hate the use of that word).
Clearly some people believe such to be true. But is it?

I can't handle eating an odd number of things, unless I close my eyes and don't pay attention. The difference between my mother and I is that I can see how odd numbers can be made symmetrical and am okay with that.

The Helicarrier is a character in its own right and plays a huge part in the film. It exists because a mobile headquarters is much more difficult for an evil organization *coughHYDRAcough* to find and destroy and protects any potential host nations from being a target. They took it one step further in the movie and gave it cloaking technology which was totally badass and a nice little treat for this Trekkie.

This week baby is measuring in around 5 and a half inches and about 7 ounces! (About the size of a bell pepper or sweet potato). Baby is now beginning to develop a myelin sheath around the nerves within the body which help insulate and transmit the impulses the brain and body send to each other. The process of myelination will continue for a year after baby is born. If we're having a girl her uterus and fallopian tubes are completely formed and in place. Baby is also now covered in vernix (the greasy white slime that covers baby right after birth). It's there to protect baby's skin from the amniotic fluid and keep it from being all wrinkly.

Now my first experience with tan tights was when I was about six and had to wear a pair playing the part of an onion in an end of year school show sing-a-long about a stew. I recall they were in a vile shade that was much browner than I was and very effective, along with an onion shaped sandwich board worn over my shoulders, at making me look both onion-like and stewed. Working the look of ingredient in vegetable goulash aside, I admit that the wrong tone can seriously detract from your look.

Luntz: Newt will you cry for me
“I have laboured, crying, hoarse have become my jaws” (verse 3). Where was this? When was this? Let us question the Gospel. For the Passion of our Lord in this Psalm we perceive. And, indeed, that He suffered we know; that there came in waters even unto His Soul, because peoples prevailed even unto His death, we read, we believe; in the tempest that He was sunk down, because tumult prevailed to His killing, we acknowledge: but that He laboured in crying, and that His jaws were made hoarse, not only we read not, but even on the contrary we read, that He answered not to them a word, in order that there might be fulfilled that which in another Psalm hath been said, “I have become as it were a man not hearing, and having not in his mouth reproofs.”(4) And that which in Isaiah hath been prophesied,” like a sheep to be sacrificed He was led, and like a lamb before one shearing Him, so He opened not His mouth.”(5) If He became like a man not hearing, and having not in His mouth reproofs, how did He labour crying, and how were His jaws made hoarse? Is it that He was even then silent, because He was hoarse with having cried so much in vain? And this indeed we know to have been His voice on the Cross out of a certain Psalm:’ “0 God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?”(6) But how great was that voice, or of how long duration, that in it His jaws should have become hoarse? Long while He cried, “Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees:”(7) long while He cried, “Woe unto the world because of offences.”(8) And truly hoarse in a manner He cried, and therefore was not understood, when the Jews said, What is this that He saith? “Hard is this saying, who is able to hear it?”(9) We know not what He saith. He said all these words: but hoarse were His jaws to them that understood not His words. “Mine eyes have failed from hoping in My God.” Far be it that this should be taken of the person of the Head: far be it that His eyes should have failed from(10) hoping in His God: in whom rather there was God reconciling the world to Himself,(11) and Who was the Word made flesh and dwelled in us, so that not only God was in Him, but also He was Himself God. Not so then: the eyes of Himself, our Head, failed not from hoping in His God: but the eyes of Him have failed in His Body, that is, in His members. This voice is of the members, this voice is of the Body, not of the Head. How then do we find it in His Body and members? …

Werewolf stories are definitely thoroughly told in the YA market, yet you still managed to put a new spin on it. Did you set out to write a werewolf novel, or did that just kind of evolve in the story once you started?
This last task is especially important to me, and thankfully it's the one I'm most able to act on. While I haven't been doing much photography, I have been doing a lot of sketching and painting-- and the island has been a great source of inspiration. What fascinates me most at the moment is not Taiwan's fascinating culture, but rather, its greener side. For while Taiwan may be known for its advanced technology and plastics manufacturing, it is also an unbelievably lush island-- my sketchbooks are filled with bats and toads, bamboo and banana trees.

Our dining table can easily seat 8 (and has sat even 12 at times) but the best memories are of the hubby and I sitting together at one end while chatting about our day, the news, favorite baseball players and the delicious food. For too many years we ate in front of the television each night and now we both look forward to this time together where we completely focus on each other.
I used the dressform stamp from lawn fawn to create a custom background with distress inks, then stamped it again using Staz-on on a piece of acetate/transparency. Then using some pop-up dots, I aligned it on the white cardstock base. The dimension is not really clear in this photo, and the pop dots are hidden under the banner, rose and the blink on the corner. I would say the card actually look much better IRL.

Whenever I get sick, I try to convince my body to just get over it. From the time in second grade that I went to school on Grandparents Day even though I felt awful and ended up throwing up all over my Oscar the Grouch project after my grandpa had left, to the time I went to work before I was fully recovered and ended up falling to the ground an hour into the day, to the time I spent nearly an entire Jamaican vacation with a fever, my first instinct is always to power through, to not give in, to be stronger than the illness.
Much excitement prevailed on Monday in Leith, centre of the Scotch wholesale liquor trade, owing to the news that Pattisons Limited were in a serious, financial embarrassment. Pattisons is one of the most extensive concerns in the trade having branches in the colonies, warehouses in London, a large brewery in the suburbs of Edinburgh, and the finest set of offices in Leith. The business is a comparatively new one, and the position in which it is now placed is said to be due to extensive advertising and underwriting. Last year's profits were returned at £52,000 but for six years previous to that they had averaged only £600. When the company was registered in 1896 the preference stock was subscribed for ten times over. The preference shares, however, which are £10 each, and which were standing at a premium on Saturday, were on Monday at close of the Stock Exchange being dealt in at £2, at which figure heavy deals were executed, shareholders in a panic rapidly unloading.

I spent Saturday in church! Not my normal location but quite enjoyable. I'd been asked if I'd like a free craft stall at the church spring flower festival. As the forecast wasn't great and the boxes in the spare room had a selection of makes left in them it seemed a good idea. I mean getting to sit down, drink tea, natter, read and crochet uninterrupted by my menfolk - what more could a girl ask for? Oh and there were sales to be made and funds will be deposited in my savings account this week :)
I have decided if I number my insanity, that it will seem ordered and will hence be read as a philosophical inquiry and not the mutterings of a madwoman. Wittgenstein or Maggie Nelson's Bluets.

One reason for this sudden epiphany, is that I've got someone representing my work in a shop up in Ruidoso, NM. When I explained some of the work I do, she was interested in the folk art stuff, which I really hadn't made in a while, but I told her I used to do that. So she asked me to send her photos of some of my work, I did, and she fell in love with the red, chile ristra, of course she did!! Ruidoso and Cloudcroft are more geared towards, what I call, white bread art...they haven't gotten the word that there's lots more to NM than ristras, howling coyotes and Kokopeli...oy! Actually, they're quite passee, but they still love selling them to people from other parts of the country and foreigners who feel these symbols are representative of NM...dear lovely Linda, you know what I'm talking about???!!!??!?!????!!!
Once Heinze alerts a client to the potential for trouble on the horizon, he says the client is generally happy to pay for extra services that will dispel future litigation. Clients expect their lawyers to stay current on the latest legal trends, Heinze says, so attorneys must know how to get that information and disseminate it to clients through the most cost-effective means. The wealth of free information on the Internet makes it cheap to meet this need. But, Heinze cautions, the process can be time-consuming and tough to learn. Most lawyers are turned off because they can't bill for it, he says. But that's false pride, he suggests.

Glee (3x14) - On My Way
On a Sunday in February, I was feeling a little lazy when I got up. The kids where spending that weekend with their dad and I was dreaming of stating in my bathrobe and pj’s all day long. I made coffee and went to go wake up my fiancé and I found him wide awake. I usually have to call him a couple of times before he even opens his eyes. I said: “why we don’t just skip church this Sunday? “ –“No no no”, was his response and that should have been the first sign that something was up. He’s the first one to want to have a lazy day. Anyway, I slowly got ready, taking as much time as possible and still we were on time.
Well, the sequence involves Bud fleeing from some unsavoury types in the Macau Floating Casino. He runs outside and jumps onto a small boat before hurling himself into the water (Bud was actually and Italian Olympic swimmer at an earlier stage in life). Well, stone me if it wasn't actually the water in Repulse Bay he jumps into. You can see by the small islets in the background that this scene was filmed very close to the previous Tin Hau Temple one.

I am more organic, I see a goal emerge and go ‘oh yeh, I might go for that’ and off I toddle. Sometimes I get there, sometimes I don’t, usually because the goal has changed before I’ve reached it, it of ground has shifted, no longer making
Cahooted here seems to have been used as a synonym for conspired or colluded, but perhaps with slightly different connotations in the speaker’s idiolect. Cahoot(s) (n.) first appeared as U.S. slang, possibly from French cahute (cabin, hut) or cohorte.

(Moving down 4 spots) Tied for 8.) The Muppet Show (Seasons 4 and 5) – From 1976 to 1981, master puppeteer Jim Henson brought his Muppets to television each week in The Muppet Show. The show has been so popular, that it catapulted Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang into movies, as well as a number of other tv shows and specials. Disney acquired the rights to the Muppets in 2004 and had originally released seasons one, two and three. Then, despite Disney Home Entertainment announcing season four at the D23 Expo in 2009 for release in 2010, it and season five have yet to be released.

The pacing and action is top-notch, and superior to Uglies. The novel moves at a fairly steady pace, and switches perspectives between Deryn and Alek at fairly regular intervals. One of the best things about this is seeing “Dylan” through Alek’s eyes and then seeing Deryn’s perspective. There’s even a pair of chapters towards the end that does my favorite thing–they show the same short period of time from vastly different views. Deryn, the swashbuckling soldier she is, weathers storms and battles and thinks very quickly on her feet, even using Alek as leverage at one point. There’s plenty of dangling from ropes attached to the Leviathan and leaping off the side for Deryn. Alek’s adventures deal more with piloting his war machine, a Storm Walker, stealthily through the night. However, Alek does gets to engage in a few thrilling battles of his own.

I remember looking at the Knowmads student bios before I applied and those sorts of thoughts popping into my head. Then when I saw Filippa’s bio, someone I knew before Knowmads, I thought her bio was as cool as everyone else’s. Since I already knew she was cool (she can pull off wearing her grandma’s clothing and go to Mexico without speaking the language just because she can), I knew my ‘dorky coolness’ could hang with her ‘coolness.’ But frankly I didn’t care if people saw me as cool or not, I just wanted to be DOING cool stuff.
So anyway, we stuck to the house, went through a ton of tissues and throat lozenges and focused on the much more important non-Easter-bunny-related aspects of the holiday. Happy Easter, everyone-- hope the bunnies didn't get you this year!
This admirably compressed lyric manages to revitalize pretty familiar tropes: the seasons, suppressed sexuality, rebirth through its sardonic sense of humor: referring to spring “as a leg,” the welcome nastiness of “doing bad things/To my body,” nature’s erectness not necessarily achieving its full virility, but it being enough “to win.”

This is an intervention idea from Amie Dean and I took it and made it my own. It is a nonverbal strategy to help redirect kids and give them a "warning" for a particular behavior. For example... if a student it talking out /over you, you set a correction card on their desk that says "please stop talking." The idea is that you can give that kid the warning they need and not have to stop your lesson to correct them or call them out and embarass them in front of the class. I thought it was a great idea and I am excited to try them out in my class!! I'll let ya know how they work!

If you are a flag waving American patriot who loves the concept of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”, TEOTWAWKI already happened, just look around you and ask yourself: If this is a free country, why must I get government permits for everything and why does the Constitution not apply anymore? Answer: This is not the United States of America any more, just ask Defense Secretary Leon Panetta who he gets permission from to go to war, it isn’t congress anymore. Or maybe ask Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, how he can refuse to answer questions during congressional hearings about who he gave trillions of dollars to.
The fear. The holding my breath. The claustrophobia. The need to run and hide. The crying at almost nothing. The avoidance. The defensiveness. The snapping. The tension in my body.

Tracking back to what happened after Noriko ran away from home, the story then tells the tragic life of Kumiko. When she was a baby, Kumiko was abandoned by her mother and left in locker # 54 at Ueno Train Station, at first it appears that Kumiko’s family rental business is her attempt at filling the void in her life for a family and a sense of belonging. But as the story progresses, Kumiko’s darker motives are revealed. Abandoned and forgotten by the world around her, Kumiko becomes emotionally disconnected and shut down. Learning to survive all on her own, she see’s people around her as selfish, unhappy, and equally disconnected from their friends, families, and themselves. It is unclear in the movie if she creates the family rental business to truly fill a void, to lure in and brainwash young unhappy girls, or if she does it all just because she can. Like with all the characters in the movie, Kumiko is like a symbolic portrayal of all the things that are f**ked up with society. She has been lost and forgotten by the world and has learned to survive on her own since childhood, and she has no emotional attachments to anything or anyone but looks at the world around her from a cold and cynical perspective.

Last year, Nintendo labelled the Wii U as a “new beginning”. Following these bold words were a handful of the biggest developers praising the console. This video symbolizes many things for the company, and a new beginning is certainly one of them. Another being the Wii U as an M-Rated gaming experience. Most would argue that Nintendo has no place in the modern-core market, but one can’t blame the company for being ambitious.
Near the bridge is an ‘English Village’ which pays respect to our culture.

Hubby got them installed, but couldn't get the gas turned back on. I'll call the gas company on Monday...

After seeing all of these perfect people with all that power, in comes a character that is slowly going blind due to an illness and is a ‘normal’ human. She is the one that finds the stone, using it only so that she can see again. So simplistic I didn’t see it coming. I was expecting the great and powerful Evalle to pick up the stone. The god’s prophecy turns to be wrong because of the unsuspecting human and things take a turn. No one can kill the human or take the stone from her or the stone would kill the assailant. Leaving the human woman protected and able to see. However, if she holds onto that stone after Sunrise on Wednesday the stone will turn on her and take over, destroying her mind and use her body to be it’s own possessor.

I had an extremely stressful senior year of high school, when I actually thought there was only ONE college in the WHOLE WORLD for me.

And I had trained myself not to try things that I might not be awesome at when it came to academics. I needed to be the best.

On the other hand, I'm currently playing around with three possible non-fiction proposals, trying to decide which to concentrate on - and I wouldn't discuss any of those on twitter until the contract's in the bag and the book quite well progressed. Whereas every fiction writer will do something completely different with the same details, the n-f books are entirely definable from the central idea. And although I like to think that my blend of experience and research skills is unique and no-one else would come up with quite the same book, I'm sure that given the basic idea many other writers could produce a very similar book. So about those potential books I can say nothing. Once I pick one, I can leak odd snippets of information and no-one will be able to guess the thread that links them. But until then, my lips are sealed.
Many artists, including musicians, writers and filmmakers were executed. Some like Ros Sereysothea, Pan Ron and Sinn Sisamouth gained posthumous fame for their talents and are still popular with Khmers today.

It may be hard to believe, but they aren’t like all the other celebrities. Sure, they’ve got the fame and the millions of fans, but they love their fans, unlike some celebrities who ignore their fans and are just in it for the fame.
So to celebrate I have decided to make some necklaces incorporating my cover artwork and give them away. It is really easy to enter. All you need to do is like or comment on this post or like, comment, share or reblog these links on my facebook or tumblr. You can enter multiple times on all of them if you like. I will be picking a random winner on Wednesday 11/04/2012. Don’t forget to leave a comment letting me know which number necklace you would like, if you have a preference (see numbered photo). I know some people don’t like social sites so you can also enter by sending me an email marnie@marniepitts.com letting me know you would like to enter the necklace draw. If you don’t win but would still like a necklace let me know and I might make some for my online shop.

Spring has finally arrived and I’m looking forward to some new and exciting things. I am going to be building a shed out of pallets, hopefully a chicken coop, a teepee style vertical garden, as well as many other DIY projects that I have been collecting or creating. All of wish I plan to share along the way. Along with gardening I love to harvest and then preserve and can the bounty, an art I am taking steps to share with others.
Your agent will guide the home owner on what needs to be done and provide recommendations such as handyman, painters, carpet cleaners, contractors, landscapers, plumbers, professional home stagers, etc. Also, they will begin marketing to their internal network and fellow agents. When I work with my exempt listings, I create marketing flyers that I distribute to agents throughout the community and surrounding areas. You never know if there is an active buyer looking for your type of home and even if you are not yet on the MLS, it is important to reach out to all the agents. Does this take time, effort and money. Absolutely…but remember, you have a listing agreement and even though your home is not on the MLS, your agent is still working very hard on your behalf. There is so much “behind the scenes” work that gets done to get a house sold for top dollar and rather than waiting to list your house since it is not yet ready…think about a short-term exempt listing. Once you are ready for showings, it is easy to transition this to an active listing.

Aside from just being a tasty treat, sumac has many delightful health benefits. For example, the deep pigments found in the berries are due to the high concentration of anthocyanins, those are the very special compounds, which exhibit antioxidant action. Anthocyanins help to decrease the risk of heart disease and cancer. They may also aid in the prevention of macular degeneration by protecting the eyes from free radical damage, increasing circulation and stabilizing collagen structures (which hold tissues together). You can also find anthocyanins in foods such as blackberries, blueberries, black rice, grapes, and açaí.

“For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!

The modern consumer, raised on video games, computers and the Internet, has become conditioned and trained and has indeed reached the point of demanding that interaction with companies be completed on an almost instantaneous interactive online basis. And yet, despite the availability of proven technology that increases productivity, reduces costs and enhances customer satisfaction, the life insurance industry remains mired in the “legacy” of outdated processing.
About 3/4 of the way through, the alcohol pleasantly reminds you of it's presence (12% ABV) and the warming sensation is akin to port, but without any real sweetness. Or rather, the sweetness of the rich malt is offset by the other flavors making an exquisite drink to both imbibe and savor.
Paul Ray Witherspoon, calling himself “Paula”, claimed he was at the hospital accompanying his “husband” Billy Lorentz to an appointment. However since Texas resident Witherspoon is legally male as is his partner, and Texas does not recognize same-sex marriage that claim is called into question. Lorentz is listed as Witherspoon’s employer on his TX sex offender record.

I preheated the oven to 350 degrees F. I have a favorite clay, deep dish pie pan from Hess Pottery (you may remember my earlier postings about them at the Reeds Spring Farmers Market; they've had national publicity for their perfect-baking pie pans) and sprayed it heavily with olive oi. I put a layer of already cooked and coarsely chopped bacon - 3 slices in all. On top of that I spread the wilted spinach leaves. I poured in the egg/milk and cheddar mixture and added 1 cup of diced ham and stirred in around slightly.
The ER was a surprisingly good experience. I got triaged right away. Then the ER doctor called up to ophthalmology and got one of the eye doctor’s to see me. And an orderly took me upstairs. I have an infection in my cornea. The doctor thinks with aggressive antibiotics I should be okay. So for two hours I had to put antibiotic drops in every fifteen minutes, and after that I’ve been putting in drops every half hour. I will also go back to the doctor tomorrow to make sure it’s working.

Women also spoke of this regret, but as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence."
So who is winning in this legal global technological Armageddon? Lets look at the scores so far.

Kalinda toyed with the idea of running, though she still didn’t explain why. Eventually the season left us with a powerful image – Kalinda in the living room of her apartment, gun in hand, waiting for someone to come knocking on her door. Archi Panjabi probably won’t get an Emmy nomination for this season’s work as Kalinda, as the material has been somewhat light, but her ability to draw infinite interest from someone so closed off never fails to amaze. I only hope that show runners Michelle and Robert King realise that the audience’s interest in Kalinda is based not on knowing her secrets, but on knowing what it’s like to have to hold them.
Late in the evening I saw Jane Judd and her husband look as if they might be making a move, and fuelled by yet more red wine and the knowledge that if I didn’t properly introduce myself I’d always regret it, a wave of courage suddenly gripped me and catapulted me into her path, blocking her exit.
Madison has a linky in April's IFTLP post for us all to link up our cards before we mail them to her. I am cheating just a bit here as I barely have time to make cards for the 2 DT's I'm on lately and I've got bunches of cards sitting in boxes that I need to weed through and get sent to OWH. So I looked and found this cutie which is going in the mail today. I know Emily likes pink and purple, horses and kitties... but pandas are pretty irresistable too, aren't they??! *Ü*
I have learned not to raise an eyebrow when people let me know their babies name, I just enquire how I spell it. When I did my midwifery secondment as part of my nurse training a million years ago the rule of thumb was the worse the social circumstances the more outlandish the name, I helped Mercedes McDonald into the world, named entirely because it was the only way her dad could have one. The very middle class mummies had lots of Lucys, Charlottes and Emilys. Now it seems that having a name that people hear and understand that it is actually a name is slightly boring, I blame celebrities, I will not bang on about Buddy Bear Oliver again and WTF is Harper Seven or should that be Harper 7?
So perhaps the other force at work here is the aforementioned recession, particularly the short-term shocks of September and October. Advertising is essential to marketing your product or service, but marketing isn't necessary in the short term if you don't have anything new to offer and you're struggling to make payroll and loan payments. Perhaps the major reason we saw so many "thank you signs" in the past two months was because of the drop-off in advertising demand. Faced with lackluster interest, it makes sense that these companies would rather replace their previous advertisers (whose contracts had run out) with something than leave their ad space blank or unchanged. If you're looking for something to fill a space, then maybe the logic of branding or "thank you" applies.

There aren't many videogames based on books, especially obscure foreign books like Metro 2033 by Dmitry Glukhovsky. There aren't many games set exclusively in Russia with nary an American hero in sight. There aren't many games of such scope and quality to have come out of Ukraine. There are a lot of "there aren't"s about Metro 2033. It has the trappings of a big-budget western release, but it's also essentially foreign. Few were surprised when, upon release in March 2010, it failed to set the sales charts on fire. However, it has since become something of a sleeper hit, earning good reviews and gaining recognition through numerous "best of 2010" lists. A sequel is now in production.

It needn't even be too dark, I'm really not talking about 'evil'. The merest of mischievous grins would be more than enough. Just something to remind us that, underneath all that glowing exterior of high standards and respectability - it's still just a little bit naughty.
ok - I'm far removed from the local news, but I have an interest in what happened. I have friends who are affected and more importantly their dear beloved children are affected - it's not a small matter at all that a school leader decided to end his own life. I'm sorry for your loss Carrie, but it is completely wrong (imnsho) to say that the details of his death are not news and should be kept private. In fact every suicide should be a call to battle for all those who care for humankind. It's a loss most tragic and often avoidable.
The report illustrates the relative competitive strengths and weaknesses of leading global clothing, footwear, accessories and luxury goods retailers, both compared with one another, as well as with the average performance of retailers in the channel around the world.
I can’t say it was all bad though. Losing all my friends caused me to start my career at an early age. In many ways I’ve risen above what people thought of me. In many ways I just started to live the life everyone thought i had. It’s been a wild ride. There are so many things I would change. I say that now, but I’m sure if you ask me again in a few years the answer would be different. It’s time to stop living in fear and start using all this as motivation to be who I was before i let these things get to me. the person who worked hard and excelled at what she loved. Maybe now I can finally put all this behind me and go back to being me. A new me. Now that I’ve found out exactly when I became lost I can remember who i was before all that and be her again.

It is known that children with autism have superior detection of detailed features in visual search tasks (O'Riordan, Plaisted, Driver, & Baron-Cohen, 2001). This can be seen as a talent, rather than a deficit. Experimentalists such as Plaisted at times see this as "enhanced discrimination" (Plaisted, O'Riordan, & Baron-Cohen, 1998) and at other times as "reduced generalization" (Plaisted, 2001). This illustrates that the very same data can be seen from opposite perspectives. "Superior discrimination of difference" highlights that although perception is abnormal in autism, it may not be arising because of damage or disorder in a perceptual mechanism, but because that mechanism is more finely tuned, functioning at a higher level. "Reduced discrimination of generality" may be a consequence of superior dicrimination of difference, but why highlight it? If the person's attentional system is tuned to notice how things differ, then of course they are going to detect differences more than controls do, and report similarity less than controls do. Focussing on the "reduced discrimination of similarity" gives the impression that the person has a deficit in a mechanism that detects similarity, essentially putting a negative spin on what is really a talent. It's like saying that someone who can tell you the names of 20 types of beetle has a deficit in saying they are all the same. To you and me they are all just beetles. To the careful observer, they are each unique.

One of the strangest articles I’ve come across recently was this story about the odd symbiotic relationship between an ant species, and a fungus that essentially turns the ants into zombies. To summarize for those students unwilling to click the link and read that summary, the fungus Ophiocordyceps would colonize a particular species of ant while it was still alive, and modify the behavior of the ant. This enabled the fungus to use the ants to spread out over a large geographical region, a novel way for a sedentary species like a fungus to spread its genes.
I thought of those stories now. I thought of that day, and all the days after. I thought of the afternoons spent in the grass, making pictures out of the clouds. I thought of the smell of the sea, and how it always makes me think of her, and I knew the trees were wrong. It was here. And it was today. It was wrong, but it was also right

For me, there is something rather thin about the characterization in this story. Certainly, The Great Gatsby is a much shorter book than, say, Middlemarch or The Pursuit of Love, however, I think Fitzgerald’s story would have done better to be a little longer and spend more time addressing the characters. Take Daisy, for example, I never felt that I really knew or understood Daisy – and she is, arguably, the most important female character in the story. Indeed, as I have said, I found most of the characters in this story extremely hard to understand and, thus, even harder to relate to. Don’t get me wrong, I did enjoy reading this book, but not for my usual reasons. Normally if I enjoy a book it has well-drawn characters, strong depictions of the dynamics at play between two people and an insight into society in general. I did not find these things in my reading of The Great Gatsby.

For lunch we ordered off the tapas menu, which speedily arrived and delicious with great hulks of fresh bread. The cakes looked amazing too, although we were feeling too virtuous to sample those. I wasn't sure about the whole 'wearing a robe into the restaurant' thing like some of others did. The spa with only a few treatment rooms, isn't big enough to have that many gowned people, and with quite a top notch menu, it was an eclectic mix of women in blue robes and flip flops, next to business men having lunch. I think this added to the charm and quirkiness of the place, but at the risk of sounding like my mother 'I would still dress for dinner!'

Our first stop of the day was DSW. Bean is looking for a pair of sling-back sandals. I am too and I need to find a better pair of tennis shoes. A pair that isn’t as raised in the heel as the current pair of Asics that I wear. Well, we searched all the aisles and the clearance racks without luck and since we couldn’t find what we were looking for we decided to make a game out of it and so we went to the high heel section to find the most obnoxious pair of heels. Bean agreed to try them on since I haven’t been able to wear heels since my knee surgery. We found some doozies. I took pictures with my awesome new phone, however, I can’t figure out how to get them saved to my computer and so…Until I do, I can’t share them with you.

In a few days, The University of Bristol Debating Society will hold a debate on plain packs. Arguing for plain packs will be Stephen Williams MP, our Super Twat of the Month for April, and an unknown debater -- ooh, the suspense. Arguing against plain packs will be Simon Clark and Christopher Snowdon. I don't know if the event page on Facebook is an accurate gauge of how many people will go to the debate but at the time of this writing 33 people have indicated they will go. As chance would have it, I will be out of the country and cannot attend. I do hope someone films and/or transcribes the debate, but I have a good idea of all the arguments anyway, so it's not that important.
The New Testament scriptures only contain Apostolic writings. The collecting of the New Testament Scriptures started in the 1st century and was completed under the oversight the Jesus’ Apostles. Look at what the New Testament clearly shows about the collection. Second Peter 3:15-16 confirmed that “all” of Paul’s writings were considered a part of “other Scriptures”. Obviously, Paul’s writings were being collected even before the New Testament Scriptures were complete, and that these were being added to the previous canon, standard collection of Scripture. “All” of Paul’s letters could not refer to every letter that Paul ever wrote in his life especially those possible letters from when he opposed the Christian faith. This reference to “all” and the reference to “other Scriptures” in this passage both refer the collection of every one of Paul’s inspired writings with “other Scriptures” refer to the establishment of new additions to Scriptures and a new collection, the “canon” of the New Testament. Now, Peter said that Paul wrote “unto you”. This is Peter’s 2nd letter unto those presented in 1 Peter 1:1 (2 Pet. 3:1), which was written to “Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia”. Peter said that Paul wrote “unto you”, and as mentioned before, Paul’s letters were only to the Ephesians and Colossians in Asia and to the Galatians, and not specifically to all of Asia and to anyone in Pontus, Cappadocia, and Bithynia. Evidently, Paul’s letters were for everyone though first written to specific congregations. This also shows not only the collection, but also the distribution of the new Scriptures in the first century. As will be affirmed, these “other Scriptures” show that Paul’s epistles were being added to the Old Testament as well as the New Testament collection progressively including the writings of at least four other New Testament writers as will be seen. The practice of collecting inspired writings and adding to the collection of the Old Testament had very easily been transferred over to the collecting of the New Testament Scripture.

As part of the work we do with people and organizations that need clarity, and in asking the right questions, we empower them to learn, communicate and make their difference in all they do. Part of this work is understanding what a true opportunity is. I will share it with you here. A true opportunity is anywhere you are needed and wanted. Both have to be in place for an opportunity to be present. There are people in your life that need you but don’t want you. Likewise, there are people in your life that want you but don’t need you. The key is to be where you are needed and wanted.

I’m not sure how this passage would help you since it says that the holy ones will meet him in the AIR and then states they will always be with the Lord. That sounds exactly what I have been stating. It is also an indication that this descending is not down to the earth, but is in the air, which could mean he descends to within the vicinity of the earth and receives the holy ones to Himself in the air.
I continue southwards, past compartments of pine, Sitka spruce and oak. Amongst the trees of the denser plantations, little ground flora grows in the shade, except for thick stands of bracken or soft rush. But where the sun penetrates along the tracks and firebreaks, a herb layer flourishes: wild roses, grasses and beautiful pink betony, the latter growing in the damp ditches along the ride edge. All this in turn attracts insect life – chirruping grasshoppers and flitting dragonflies – that seem unperturbed by the many humans, two-wheeled and two-legged, passing by.

When Billy Joel released Piano Man in 1973, it was a triumphant return to music that would resonate for decades to come. Fed up with his old record label, William Martin adopted his middle name and hit the LA music scene and piano bars. It was there, along with some of his greatest hits, that he penned “New Mexico.” Released on Piano Man with the new monicker “Worst Comes to Worst”, the song encapsulated the the album. Weaving between friendly yet mysterious women, life on the road, and an introspective evaluation of life in the present, the song remains one of Joel’s most underrated (in my opinion).

The RR approach in these circumstances should be for an analysis of how and why the mess happened in the first place; and then to ask whether German control would work in practice.

Again, I wanted something that was surprising for Easter. And, considering a small budget, making very large tissue paper flowers would accomplish my goals listed above to be clean, surprising, white and spectacular-ish. I knew these would be a one-time use, since they would not withstand the rigors of set up and tear down every week, but considering that making the flowers cost less than $15 total, it was completely worth it. A few friends of mine sat with me and made about 20 flowers, most of which went into glass vases that the church already owned. I used sticks from my woods for the "stems" and attached the flowers to the sticks with floral wire, though normal twisty ties would work great, too.
I felt good except my feet! I’m in serious pain! I made a critical error and wore my Vibram five fingers. Although, they were great in the mud and on hills, I couldn’t climb walls and on the rocks they were hell! Catching a sharp rock in the arch was excruciating. It was also treacherous having to watch every step on the trails.

I am that Dad. I am that Dad who goes swimming when he is tired, because he knows that he'll get more energy as soon as he hears his children's laughter. I am that Dad who makes a hot dog smothered with bacon and pepperoni at 2:00am, because it's what sounds good to his child right now. I am that Dad who will sit in a coffee shop and play Monopoly for three hours or until I lose, whichever comes first, because when I can be patient I can learn new ways to have fun. I am that Dad who goes to three stores to find their favorite ice cream when they lose one too many rounds of Mario Kart, because ice cream heals more tears than words do. I am that Dad who says "yes" when my youngest wants to buy a zippo, because he really isn't very likely to burn down anything too important. I am that Dad who can wipe a butt with a smile, because wiping it with a frown sucks for both of us. I am that Dad who is never perfect, but who tries his best every day to stay connected with his life, because I am not perfect and have no desire to pretend to be so. I am that Dad who is honest and real, despite my warts, because my kids will all have warts and I want them to grow up without fearing them. I am that Dad who is unafraid to sing loudly with the windows open because life should be celebrated in freedom; who is willing to have his toenails painted, because all little girls need to be able to paint outside the lines; who will wrestle seven kids at once in a public park, because it's okay to get a public ass-whooping every now and again; and who speaks in his Monty Python voice while walking through a nice restaurant, because people are way too fucking stuffy and I don't want my kids to think that they have to be that way when they grow up. I am the Dad who loves my kids enough to question the status quo behind everything from our education system to traditional parenting styles to my own abilities and struggles, because my kids deserve that and so much more. I am the Dad who cries at certain commercials, because certain commercials are touching and we all need to recognize the value of a good cry. And I am the Dad who knows that he doesn't know best about much, except for about the fact that his partner and kids are simply amazing. I am THAT Dad.
There is a ritual, practised here in the south of Germany each spring: the harvesting of Baerlauch. This is a plant which I was unfamiliar with before moving here, as it doesn't grow in North America. In English it's know as Ramson, or Bear's Garlic, or Wood Garlic. In Latin it's called Allium ursinum, and was believed to have been the first food that bears emerging from hibernation would eat.

As no-one had stormed out or demanded monies back by this stage we blazed on into the third course of Steak Diane with green beans and a keg of Mountain Goat Hightail Ale. Again, a big flavoured English style Amber Ale described by its creator, Dave Bonighton, as a ‘crazy mongrel’ for its American hop bang is not something many of the crowd would naturally seek out but the third empty keg of the night justified my decision to introduce them to Goat Beer.

For the past few years, it’s been quite a trendy, quirky spot, with lots of generally overpriced (yes, we know how to mug tourists in more ways than one) junk/bric-a-brac and antique shops and several decent restaurants. It’s very touristy in summer, and getting there and back in the high season can be a real nightmare. The narrow main road gets clogged with traffic moving at pace which would make a snail proud. I noticed though, as we wandered around yesterday, that a lot of the shops have closed down and new whacky boutiques have opened – sign of the times, or recession, who knows.

As I look at my photo archives I realize that as of late my albums bear rather generic titles. In some ways it’s as if I’m just randomly throwing crap into the ocean of the internet. Looking at the results though I can’t help but feel quite a bit of pride. Each day that I bother to take photos I feel as if I come back with something pretty interesting despite the fact that my planning is exceptionally minimal. I enter each day with very few intentions and yet good still seems to result. On some deeper level I can’t help but ponder what that means. Am I just casting my lucky chafe to the wind or is there some larger statement being made? I like to think that the statement in question is simply that “the world is beautiful all by itself if you will only take time to look!” For every picture I do take there are a dozen that I cannot that I wish I could. Our world really is a beautiful one but how many of us actually take the time to realize that? While those who bear the official title of “professional photographer” click away at the same rehearsed, banal, redundant poses, I’m hopeful that some of us will still spend the time to capture the natural world as it is, without embellishment. OK, enough philosophy. How about some photos?

Over the years, he’d played the game of cat and mouse with many women, but none amused him more than this little one. As he breathed in her intoxicating scent, his body and brain went into hunter mode. He wanted to shag her, no needed to fuck hard and feed ravenously, so said his aching fangs and cock, over-riding all sane thought. One night is all he required, or a few hours worked just as well to sate his hunger. His elongated incisors pricked the bottom of his lip. The coppery taste of blood tantalizing his tongue caused his desire to increase. The scent of blood flowed through her veins, titillating his nose. The touch of her skin caused his cock to twitch in his jeans.

“Underneath the layer of shells the earth was very dark and appeared to be mixed with vegetable mold to the depth of 1 foot. At the bottom of this, resting on the original surface of the ground, was a very large skeleton lying horizontally at full length. Although very soft, the bones were sufficiently distinct to allow of careful measurement before attempting to remove them. The length from the base of the skull to the bones of the toes was found to be 7 feet 3 inches. It is probable, therefore, that this individual when living was fully 7½ feet high.”

The floor and walls looked as if they were covered in mud however, thanks to my nose, I knew it wasn’t mud. ‘They’ were going to make me leave the building the way most things end up in this body, down the “dump”. Scared for my life I closed my eyes and started to give up fighting when I heard screaming coming from one of ‘them’, Chad had been following us and was now taking ‘them’ out one by one. He grabbed me in his arms and carried me out of the basement. We ran all the way to the top floor and needed a plan.

She'd insisted she didn't need help and I was letting her have her way and leave, but I had no idea she'd go off the deep end doing stupid shit.
Again, this is not a defense of any particular item on the all-purpose protest agenda of the OWS folk. Only an observation that if you are going to critique someone’s arguments, critique their arguments. Is there nothing to protest? Then show that in fact our government is run fairly and efficiently, the needs of the poor are tended to adequately, workers are paid reasonable wages, and there is therefore no need for change of this or that type.

“Recently, Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, testified before the House Budget Committee on the growth of the 10-largest “means tested” federal programs that serve people who qualify by various definitions of poverty. Here’s what Haskins reported: From 1980 to 2011, annual spending on these programs grew from $126 billion to $626 billion (all figures in inflation-adjusted “2011 dollars”); dividing this by the number of people below the government poverty line, spending went from $4,300 per poor person in 1980 to $13,000 in 2011. In 1962, spending per person in poverty was $516.”
Hi all! After seeing this adorable pillow from Prudent Baby one day on Pinterest I knew I HAD to make one for my rainbow loving daughter! It looked so simple to make (it's just a pillow right?) that I thought it would be the perfect "real" project for my sewing machine. Well, after spending an hour or so getting myself re-acquainted with my sewing machine I went to work on the pillow. I followed the directions (somewhat) on the tutorial from Prudent baby except for sewing the yellow thread on top of the pocket. It came out sooo cute and my daughter ADORES it! Yes, it took a little longer than expected but not too bad and I think maybe I could try more sewing, (we'll see how that goes).

I can’t read poetry straight through like a novel. Instead I skip around from page to page and read wherever the page stays open long enough for me to fix my gaze.

Together the composition and visual contrast features were found to be a “substantial part” of photo 1 and to have been copied by photo 2. Although the analysis is quite detailed it is very hard to see how a photo taken at a different angle, with a different foreground, exposure level and perspective could infringe. Arguably all that is really copied is that idea of a black and white photo of the Houses of Parliament with a red bus in the foreground.

Of course I have some relational and spiritual goals as well, but the following goals are related to food, cooking, and health. I've found that one goal per month is realistic and much better than a weekly goal. I've also found that I learn best through my mistakes, so a full month gives me more time for trial and error.

A word of caution about water beads. If you read the label it says to keep out of the reach of young children. It also says things like it will plug up plumbing. You will have to think what that means for you. For me it meant knowing the children in my classroom and knowing when to supervise more closely. The week I had them out, I did not have any children try to put them in their mouths. I did have to ask them not squish them; that was the great temptation. Oh, and it also meant I could not pour any down the drain.

The photographer is Bailey - in doing a Google search I didn't find much, but did find a couple of other pictures posted by Bailey or Bailey Studios which were obviously by the same person. I tried searching on Ancestry.com and found an Art Bailey in the 1905 Wisconsin State Census age age 30, occupation photographer. He was born in Michigan to parents born in England. He was married to Lilosa age 24 and with son Samuel? age 1. I had no luck finding him in earlier or later censuses. I am guessing this photo to have been taken around 1900 give or take five years either way.

Jay loves Math. With him, my biggest problem is finding a way to make all the Math programs work together, without being overload. He requested more story problems next year, so we're getting books of just story problems to add to his Math next year. He loves measurement, which is part of the reason we added the Key to series for Measurement & Metric Measurement. He's doing both Fractions and Decimals & Percents in 3rd because he wants to do both in one year. He can hardly wait for the Life of Fred Fractions and Decimals & Percents books to get here.

Answer: It is a lot of fun! I'm teaching part-time. But kids can sometimes be too honest. One kid said to me today, "I can't wait for the REAL TEACHER to come back." (I'm filling in for a gal who is out because of surgery) Can you just FEEL THE LOVE?
That’s called platonic love,
... would come crowding around the bed and throw themselves on the covers, and whoever was the smallest at the time would kiss him all over his wrinkled brown face and begin to tickle him so that he would laugh all down in his stomach... Although Mr. Sweet was alcoholic, he was a good playmate, and they were determined to bring him back.
Today it doesn't matter that our escape from all things cold and cloudy has led us straight to all things torrential in the tropics. The rain will probably stop for short bursts of sunshine and if it doesn't we'll make our own sunshine.
Omigbodun lucidly appears as a seer that sees everything which can also be said as the truth and thereby brings it out for us to see. The problems of dilapidated structure of public schools and how students suffer with the issue of strike as a result of negligence/corrupt life of our government in paying the salary of the teachers. It is very devastating!

2) Republican support for Mitt Romney. This one’s also a bit of a surprise to me. I’ve heard a lot of this, too: “If (the candidate I support) doesn’t win, Romney would be ok.” Does this mean he’s the actual leader to get the nomination, as he’s the one guy the party can agree on across the board?
I concluded that Jennifer E Smith's research had mostly been conducted by watching Richard Curtis films, and to be fair, none of the above would put off most readers of this soft-centred romance. But they put me off, and meant that I didn't take the love story or the main character's angst over her father's remarriage all that seriously.
Heat large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the teaspoon of oil, swirling to coat the base of the pan. Place the portobellos face down, and let cook until they just start to release their liquid, approximately 5 minutes. Add the wine, letting it cook off almost completely. Add a cup or so of water, the vegetable base, carrot, celery, onion, thyme, and a few good shakes of freshly ground pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until mushrooms are braised through, approximately 45 minutes to an hour. Remove mushrooms from broth and set aside. Strain broth into a separate saucepan.

Every year I tell myself I'm going to buy a special, "real" vintage outfit to wear, but I still keep being able to cobble together outfits from my existing clothing that look enough of the part so that I can wear something somewhat in the 1920s fashion. The only thing I'm wearing here that's vintage is the fur stole that was my grandmother's, but even that was probably circa 1940. The hat is from Buenos Aires (the main compliment getter today. I am still convinced that people will go out of their way to be nice to you if you are wearing a cute hat.). The shoes are Clarks (even though a fellow waiting in line with me told me they looked more 1930s) and the coat was a bargain at H&M on clearance for $30.
In early 2009, AkzoNobel revealed massive losses of £970 million, largely as a result of buying ICI. More job losses were projected, and a pay freeze was imposed on most of the company’s employees. In 2011, the group was still struggling.

Beatty was charged with 19 felony counts and remains in jail on $249,500 bond.
His remarks yesterday, about how Astro butchered a newscast by BBC World News, conveniently misses the whole point of why the BBC protested. It was about how Astro, using the excuse of meeting Malaysian government “content guidelines” had violated the editorial integrity of the newscast on the Bersih mass rally in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.

On June 20 British forces had been driven from the district with the loss of 22 lives. Mitchell knew that 500 well-armed police mutineers and terrorists had taken up positions there and were prepared to fight. He recalled: "It is the most thrilling sound in the world to go into action with the pipes playing. It stirs the blood and reminds one of the heritage of Scotland and the Regiment. Best of all it frightens the enemy to death."

When I first pulled it out of the box I was like a kid in a candy store! Shiny new tech in the house. I pulled off my old phones and was all fired up to charge the phones. One of the problems I ran into right away is that it doesn’t mound on the wall. I only have one phone jack in my kitchen and that’s where the base always sits. So, as of right now, the phone is sitting on the floor. They need to have a piece that modifies the base to attach to the wall.

The reviews on BeerAdvocate are pretty good. Here's a quote from one in particular:
Pakistan and China have perhaps the most axiomatic of relationships between any two sovereign states in the world today. It is a relationship that matured fairly early in its lifetime, and has since resolutely withstood the test of time. Notwithstanding the fact that Pakistan is ideally situated in geopolitical terms to serve China’s strategic interests in the region and provide it access to the warm waters of the Arabian Sea as an alternative trade route, the relationship also offers tremendous ammunition for Pakistan’s economic development.

Big changes are coming in the realm of scientific research in the United States. In the past, innovations in engineering and theoretical physics primarily have been funded by the government. The major contributors to the development of new technologies and experimentation have been universities. But recently we have begun to see a shift away from this traditional procedure in favor of a more private means as the funds the government offers seem to dwindle. What has caused this shift away from the norm from the last two hundred years of academic study and scientific research in general? With the rising consensus that America’s budget is in trouble, applied and theoretical science research has taken a backseat with the risk that we may never be able to compete on a global scale again. The biggest concerns involved are conservative skepticism and the indifference of voters, yearly shifts of the government’s budget, withdrawal of government funds from partially finished projects, an increase in funds for medical research, and the multitude of universities competing for funding in similar research.

A great way to practice writing the letters is by tracing them. Write the letters on a piece of paper with plenty of space around each one. Have your child trace the letters with a pencil, crayon, or marker. After your child can trace them, see if he/she can do it without the tracing as a guide. Again, start with capital letters. There are even fonts available for download that print letters (and numbers!) with dashed lines for tracing!
3 1/2 out of 5 – Positive role models – There are a lot of “pairings” in this book that represent how you should be loyal to others, and even in the fiercest of enemies, they make a good team.

I live in senior housing HUD so I have LOTS of benefits. Speaking of housing I also have two residences. My primary is of course my senior housing, a lovely small building on the outer edge of a small village where I have large green pines, outside my windows with lots of birds and deer that visit every day. Within 1/2 mile there is a wooded island where I walk alot and further down a bike trail where I bike 7 miles! I do yoga twice a week and go to the gym 2 to 3 times a week. I have many friends in my building and the community, as well as former co-workers and long time friends.
The scholarship exam was in three parts, two rounds of tests, and for those who did well enough, a final interview. My memory of the tests is hazy and mixed up with later experiences of exams, but I'm pretty sure we had to sit in a huge hall with tall windows. The first challenge was probably finding my seat - walking down the long rows to find an empty chair at one of the wooden fold-up tables, taking my seat while looking around at the other girls, watching them place their pencils neatly on the table-tops.

The central question of the research is, ‘How did African workers’ acquire the diverse range of workplace knowledge, skills and technological experiences required to build the contemporary Caribbean civilisation?’ The presumption made here is that African workers, such as these 312, brought with them to their new Caribbean lives, the same education and training philosophies under which they were educated and trained in the African context. These African-centered education and training philosophies ensured transmission and acquisition of the values, attitudes and beliefs necessary for economic growth, competitiveness, and social stability. One such education and training philosophy is termed ‘Sankofa’ (Tedla 1995), which when translated from Swahili to English means ‘to look back to fetch wisdom from the past’ to guide future developments. The Sankofa concept is symbolized by a large bird, like the pelican or the ‘boobie’, the St Kitts national bird, with an egg of wisdom at its feet or in its mouth. The idea is that wisdom and learning is transmittable, across generations, space and time, functional and fluid, without boundaries, and these are the values and beliefs underpinning the ‘Sankofa’ thought.

Indeed the very problems I have highlighted in this article that occurred within the left itself, such as the moving away from the traditional lefts platform by the bulk led to the formation of the Respect Party an amalgamation of extreme leftists and Islamic anti-Zionists and radicals, two almost exact polar opposites coming together to form a defensive coalition against the new ideology. Indeed the turning of the fringe right towards a pro-Israeli position led to such a formation permitting much later the negating of public anger in a nationalistic direction. It is a very complex set of events, much in the way of smoke and mirrors, however, the truth is that politics has changed, that the traditional left right paradigm is no more and the political new order has arrive, is now mainstream, online and ready to serve its paymasters.

No matter how “good” a product may be or how much we “like” it, the financial results will always tell the true story of how well a given company will be able to produce the “good” product that we “like/love” so much.

I thought long and hard about whether or not to write about what still makes me think and question and wonder in my faith. I didn’t want to leave the impression that my faith journey has been the easiest journey of my life, though it has certainly been one of the most thought-provoking and fulfilling. I’ve decided not to because being Bahá’í means being open to the independent search for truth, and supporting others on their own journeys toward truth. It’s not for me to point out the struggles – it’s up to each person to learn about the faith on their own terms.

Nothing clears a metaphysical fog quite like a concrete example, and Wiebe uses the structure of his book to do so brilliantly. Throughout the story, the past and present (and thus future) have existed simultaneously within the covers of the book. In the final chapter, we return to the Danzig of the1600′s, where Adam Wiebe the engineer, now an old man, expresses his hopes for his grandchildren, for the future. We as readers, are, of course, in a privileged position to appreciate this future. We have held it in our hands, riffled through its pages. For us, it has already happened.

I hurt my knee years ago. I made my first hospital visit in a wheelchair, so to be fair, they couldn’t see how tall I am. They handed me a pair of crutches which, when I stood up, towered over my head. Everyone had a good laugh when I said, “I always wanted to learn how to use stilts.”
The chemistry of a soufflé is relatively simple. First the yolks (mostly fats) are separated from the whites or albumen (more proteins) which uncoil their spiral shapes as they are beaten until just stiff, a process called denaturation. The egg white proteins latch onto one another and create a miniscule web of trapped air bubbles. Actually, the protein in the egg whites forms a kind of skin around these bubbles.

Before Myspace, Facebook, or other social networking sites became popular, online culture was relatively undefined and used by a rather narrow group of people. In other words, it was not mainstream or widely used. One of the first methods of online real-time communication was "Internet Relay Chat", or IRC, which people often accessed from university-provided UNIX accounts. UNIX accounts also provided a "finger" command, which showed you basic information about another user -- an online "profile" of sorts. It had information such as name, email address, and a ".plan" file which the user could fill with any information they chose. The information was neither required nor validated. These online personas could be entirely anonymous, and easily kept that way. While people did meet each other in person after contact via IRC, meeting people in person after only online communication was much less common than it is today. The taboo of meeting someone online was that it was "weird" or that people only met online because they had personality issues or something of that nature (completely untrue, might I add). The demographic of people using IRC was a very narrow group of people who were interested in using computers as a communication device and had the skills to use the IRC program. It is difficult to say how many people were communicating via the Internet in that fashion, and many have abandoned that mode in favor of more popular modes such as ICQ, AIM, or Googletalk. Chat programs are now extremely popular for everything from providing online customer support to chatting between friends on social networking sites.

Wheatgrass has been used for thousands of years as herbal medicine due to its therapeutic and nutritional properties. In the 1970s, Dr. Ann Wigmore opened the Hippocrates Health Institute in Boston, nourishing terminally ill patients back to health with fresh squeezed wheatgrass juice, which restores alkalinity to the blood (due to the abundance of alkaline minerals). Wheatgrass improves energy levels, strengthen the immune system and slow the development of various types of cancer. It is useful in treating colitis and other bowel conditions. Wheatgrass detoxifies and cleanses the large intestine and liver, and is beneficial to blood, and is used to treat blood disorders including anemia.

I do have to say that the book he's working on at present, about the nature of human agression, examined by contrast with other apex predators (there are almost two hundred, apparently, and they including Orcas, African lions, caimans and a whole slew of others), seems to combine the best features of his earlier, more "scholarly" work with his later, more "popular" books on animal emotions.

The final game will see Stoke travel to Liverpool. Last years runners-up will be aiming for a repeat visit to Wembley and will be the fresher of the two teams with not playing midweek. Liverpool could tire in this game following an enthralling Mersey derby win over Everton. Having previously been on a poor run of form I think this match is going to be very evenly fought. One big question for Liverpool fans is whether Steven Gerrard is capable of playing another 90mins following the derby match. Stoke put in a good performance against Chelsea at the weekend only losing 1-0 despite being down t 10 men for much of the game. Kick Off: Sun 16:00 Prediction: Stoke Win 1-0
Initially I wasn't used to the shake before you use procedure which is a must for this toner. I need to well mix the liquid as before applying to my skin. The powder tend to resides at the bottom of the bottom so you need to shake it before use. This product has a faint menthol kind of refreshing scent that goes away after awhile so no worries. After applying after face wash, my skin feels slight cooling & refresh for quite a while due to the mattifying effect by the powder which keeps oil away from my skin. It does a pretty good job in oil control as I noticed I require less blotting these days or did my skin condition improve? haha I'm not sure about the unclog & refine pores effect as i dun see much different from my facial session (extraction still painful). I do feel it somehow subsides a bit of my slight breakout recently but I'm greedy and want more miracle to happen.

The only thing I have left is to let him run around naked. I have heard this works. I am still debating whether it is worth it. I really think diapers aren't that expensive...but in all honesty, if someone will take my child now and potty train him within a month, I would pay hundreds of dollars. Yes, seriously. Have you tried to potty train lately? We started so long ago I can't even remember when we started. I began when the books say to - he started showing interest. He learned quickly the purpose of sitting on the potty. He pees every time he sits! In fact, he's so good at it, he can pee, stop, then two minutes later, pee again to try and convince me he deserves more candy and another sticker! The problem is, he is convinced he has "better things to do" and finds the convenience of peeing on himself better than sitting on the potty for two minutes. I have tried to convince him it takes me longer to change his diaper, but really, he just doesn't care. Did I mention hundreds of dollars? Anyone?
For those of you who might remember the Thimbleberries Quilt blocks I worked on all last yr., I did manage to finally get all 12 done~ I think I had blocks (1 - 10) done as of last fall, but can't remember if I showed you block #10, so here it is!Now just remember I'm more of a 'quilter~wanna~be' than an actual quilter, so don't look too closely! I tried my best to get my points to line up as much as I could, but some are and some aren't quite.
I found this quote on the page before the introduction to Richard Restak‘s book, Think Smart: A Neuroscientist’s Prescription for Improving Your Brain’s Performance. He regards Art Buchwald as one of the most intelligent people he has ever met. Dr. Restak has written many interesting books and this one certainly does not disappoint. The book is divided into six parts followed by an epilogue. They are

Just thought I'd pop up a small card that I finished this weekend. Again, don't be pulling out your score cards for my Copic colouring. I might well need to go back to Kindy, because I obviously missed a few important skills classes back then, but I tried to hide my efforts with some mottling using an old face washer and the Colourless Blender fluid (this was a technique I learn't from a video on the Stamp Embellish Create forum....but I can't actually find that video again). Anyway, I like the look, and it helps hide stuff...you know....bad, Copic colouring no-hoper-type stuff!

Picture: The problem is countrywide: KwaZulu-Natal rivers are also showing identical levels of pollution, as this picture by Durban photographer Snowey Smith shows in the rage-blog the ‘Death of Durban’.

Some of his solutions, though less clearly spelled out, will have resonance too – the importance of local initiative and control, voluntarism and social responsibility, cooperatives, mutuals, social enterprise, and other forms of association and community self-help. All this has enormous appeal as it seems to be putting people and their relationships at the centre of things — where they belong. Blond’s work is brimming with good and important ideas and we ought to be watching with great interest as the U.K. government implements at least some of them. We are already seeing examples of social enterprise that show promise, and thinkers like Davies have set out ways to encourage mutuals and meaningful employee ownership. We are also seeing examples of social entrepreneurship where citizens are taking control over issues that matter to them, not waiting for government. And Blond’s understanding of the need to harness the market and regulate the corporate sector for the common good is a refreshing voice in a neoliberal world.
My children have treated Palestinians - my son was at a check point for many, many months. Not once did a Palestinian woman die in labor; on the contrary, when she approached, she was rushed through. You shame yourself with your baseless lies and insinuations. Worse, you've fallen for the propaganda nonsense again. Sure, women have given birth at the check points - usually assisted by army medics and soldiers - but I have a friend who gave birth in an elevator - is the army to blame for that too? One ended up giving birth at home - do we blame soldiers there?

Over the past year or so, I've been blessed to find myself in some leadership roles in my church. I have given the sermon, I'm leading a ministry, I teach Sunday School, I'm helping to lead worship on our Praise Team, and more. If there is something I really can't do, I say no. Most of the time, I feel like a quick prayer lets me know if this is an important opportunity that God is bringing to me.
A few days ago I shared my enthusiasm over rock act The Quip, that released its first EP little over two months ago. In what little time has passed since, The Quip entered the list over my current favorite bands. Of course I was eager to find out more, and the band's drummer swiftly ensured that my questions were answered:

When a man’s deeds are discovered after death, his angels, who are inquisitors, look into his face, and extend their examination over his whole body, beginning with the fingers of each hand. I was surprised at this, and the reason was thus explained to me:
By the example of Arjuna we are to learn that we should only perform work which is sanctioned by Kṛṣṇa. This is the mission of human life, but we do not know it. Because of our ignorance we engage in so much work which is connected with the bodily or material conception of life. Kṛṣṇa wanted Arjuna to fight, and although Arjuna did not want to fight, he fought because Kṛṣṇa desired it. We have to learn to follow this example.
It is no secret that the academia and mainstream media has been hijacked by the left, heart and soul. So when the left steadfastly refuses to acknowledge empirical reasoning in their political ideology, is there any wonder that the right no longer has any faith in science?

I also use just a top layer of store bought puff pastry, rather than making an actual pie, in order to save time & effort. The dish is seasoned with some sweet wine, and Herbs de Provence which are available at the grocery store these days. A little bit of a béchamel sauce gives it some creaminess. I happened to have some leeks that I picked up at the Produce Stand, so I threw those in as well. If you don't have any leeks or don't want to deal with cleaning them, you can just use more onion, although leeks give the dish an extra depth of flavor.

I arrived and was rushed quickly to the VIP Press Breakfast – amazing eggs and tea while I mingled with the guys from Ghana TV. I was then escorted to a seat under a tent on the celebration ground just next to the VIP tent. The ceremony was great and attended by hundreds of people and media. Speeches from the top district politicians, Agricultural Director and the Regional Minister all spoke to the importance of Farmers in the Northern Region and some of the issues that were currently being faced (climate change, bush burning). Tens of farmers were given awards and prizes and recognized for excelling in agriculture. Cultural music and dancing in between speeches broke the monotony.

Speaking of old habits, another example the report cites is vehicle use. With the rising price of gasoline and fears about global warming, many people have become interested in buying more fuel-efficient cars. But the report points out that potentially larger gains could be made if more people got rid of their cars entirely and enrolled in the vehicle-sharing programs that have become available in many cities, like Zipcar and Hertz On Demand.

There are many modern sewing patterns on the market that will help produce a great Pre-Raphaelite costume. Almost all of the “historic” costumes that are made by Simplicity and McCall’s, intended to represent the Ancient Greek, Medieval (here, also) or Italian Renaissance eras, while not historically accurate for the costume of those eras, would make perfect Pre-Raphaelite dress. In addition, any pattern for a Lord of the Rings Elf or Human costume, or an Arthurian Queen Guinevere, would make a good Medieval-style Pre-Raphaelite costume, as well as patterns from Ever After or The Princess Bride. Christmas Nativity scene costume patterns provide good tunic shapes for men and women, or you can even make a toga from a bed sheet. You're just going for the general "look" of the Pre-Raphaelites, so have fun coming up with ideas!
The other week I was reading Adam Beale’s fab blog ‘Five against one‘ rather than doing what I was supposed to be doing and yet again I found myself chastising myself for not going to #eltchat anymore (it’s actually the fault of doing CELTA at the times that the chat is held rather than of my own choosing), since Adam had blogged a summary of the latest chat, that just happened to be on one of my pet topics and favourite ways of teaching – guided discovery.

Most researchers believe there are many factors other than age related activity changes that contribute to this condition. Amongst these are the metabolic changes that take place within the muscle tissue itself. Recent research has found that older individuals may not be getting enough protein in their diet and that they do get, may not be efficiently utilized in building muscle tissue. This effect may be caused by an altered response to the available and diminishing hormones. Be this as it may, older muscle still responds well to amino acids particularly to the essential and branched chain amino acids (BCAA) due to their ability to intensely stimulate protein synthesis in older individuals.

SEEKING HIM IN EVERY SITUATION.
SURLY FURIOUS smells fantastic, with fresh hops and an aromatic mix of scotch-ale style malts and even pineapple in the mix. The pundits call it an IPA, and maybe they're right, but it tastes to me more like a malty Scottish ale that's been infused with a insanely liberal dose of hops, then balanced perfectly. In case you're not familiar with the concept of "International Bitterness Units", or IBU's, this has got 99 of 'em, and that's about as high as you can go - so no namby-pambys allowed here. Fluffy head, fresh taste, and just a winning combination of flavors all around. 9.5/10.
I felt her there today. I was telling her about my friend - Jill knew her too, and this friend was an important part of her battle with cancer - I told Jill I was worried about my friend, and I asked her to go there and watch over her for awhile. At that moment, I felt a hand touch my shoulder, and I had an almost overwhelming feeling of peace come over me. When Jill was alive, whenever I talked to her about something I was worried about, she would always put her hand on my shoulder, and look me in the eyes and tell me that everything was going to be alright. And she had a certain way of saying it that just made me believe her, and it would instantly make me feel like everything was going to be alright. That was what I felt at the cemetery today, and it's not the first time that has happened. I wrote about it here awhile back too. I know it sounds like wishful thinking, or my mind convincing me I felt something that wasn't real, but I swear to you I felt her presence there. It was sudden, and startling, and she was there, I know she was.

Consider the Guy Ritchie classic ‘Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels’. Though there is an original score, courtesy of David A Hughes and John Murphy, it is the selection of pre-released material that so potently conveys and reflects the sentiments of the characters involved. Eddie loses his friends’ money in a high stakes poker game. Iggy and the Stooges’ ‘I Wanna Be Your Dog’ plays as he exits the venue. Note the poignant first line “I’m so messed up, I want you here…” The dark riff is arguably as powerful an emotive device as the blurred, rotating, close up camera shots of the plot’s protagonist. When a switch of mood for a celebratory drinking scene is required, EZ Rollers’s ‘Walk This City’ successfully reinforces an atmosphere of levity.

Well it now re stitched, I was taught to use herringbone stitch on heavy fabrics so stitching it was not a problem but do you know how much fabric there is round the hem of a kilt.

I have been infatuated with homemade cheese and this one is the third one in a row that came out of my kitchen. This Indian cheese falls in the category of fresh cheeses that are made here in Serbia but our brand is not known world over. Cheese that is made with pasteurized milk looses many of its wonderful qualities since all the essential bits that give each cheese its flavor are lost with the process of pasturazation. That is why the French cheeses are famous.
