Some have asked why I called my last post "A letter to Tory England". I did so, because it is aimed at those living in the villages and Market Towns of so called “Middle England” and because they are primarily white and primarily they vote for the Conservative party. Yes, there are Labour voters in the countryside, as there are Tories in the cities, however, if one were to strip away the large urban areas of Britain (dream on) and leave only those parts of it I am addressing there would a huge and permanent Tory majority, at least there would be until everything begins to crumble.

It's amazing to watch how things have progressed with Ryan's fine motor skills. Gross motor has always been his strong suit, with how he learned to walk so soon and how he took to being such a fearless dare-devil. He has always enjoyed a bit of "drawing" or "kuh-woh" as he calls it, but moreso now I notice he is taking lots of time and really focusing on what he is doing. They are still marks of lines and dot-dot-dots, but now they are more purposeful. He is even making attempts to colour within the lines with his crayons!

Goodbye. I said goodbye to one of my best friends this weekend. Tavi – the same Tavi that gave me my awesome new haircut, took me to my first yoga class, and came with me to my plastic surgery consultation – is gone. He and his boyfriend Antonio are both aerialists, and they booked a gig in a circus show that’s bring performed on a cruise ship. So, for the next seven months, they’re going to be cruising up and down the Pacific coast, from Alaska to Colombia, flipping and swinging and twirling the whole way.
I always thought Valentine was for lovers & couples.
First and foremost – this is for my best friend Joni. I happen to have a very nice and fulfilling vacation before my birthday. When suddenly – a girl friend of mine sent me a pile of email with a 20 minute interval. I wanted to comfort her, but I am miles away. So, for you my friend, and all the girls out there – Cheer up! This is the day when you will stop “figuring it out”.

The big night finally arrives. I’m all set! Thermos flask loaded with tea, small candle lantern to see me through the vigil, full box of ciggies and a couple of lighters and away I go. I had barely started the car before the heavens opened. Torrential rain poured from the dark night sky, driving was treacherous and given that the build-up and anticipation for the coming vigil was already near overflowing, my nerves were close to breaking point! I was relieved to finally arrive safely at St Margaret’s.

“Something the Lab had come up with to deal with the Neos. It operates on a jamming principle, designed to short out a Neos soldier-class drone and render it immobile and helpless until we could get it secured and transported for analysis. Now–mind you–this was a prototype and fell into disuse; meaning that it never went past the primary production stage–”

Around 400 BCE Aristotle in his Politics, went over the numerous kinds of government systems. (I’ll spare you a lot of Aristotle’s words because, as much as I love the man’s philosophy, what is left of his works has a style dryer than a stale cracker in the middle of the Gobi desert at noon…that and I’m planning a whole series of blogs on his Nicomachean Ethics to start in a month or so, so don’t think you’re getting out of this). The long and short of it is that he dislikes extremes. Rule by only the rich leads to corruption and misery. Rule by only the poor leads to stealing the wealth of the rich and anarchy. Rule by one person leads to tyranny and suffering. Rule by letting everyone vote (even if they’re criminals or non-citizens…I wonder who would be dumb enough to support something that insane?) leads to chaos and anarchy. Aristotle liked middle ground.* He liked the idea of a constitutional government, of a government of what he called aristocracy (we would call it a republic or representative government) and democracy, of where the law was higher than the whim of the ruling body (a set Constitution that is higher than the will of the mob) but not set in stone where it can never be changed (the process of amending that constitution). But of the things he goes over a lot is his distrust of the very rich and the very poor. He points out that whenever the concerns of either of these groups takes precedent it is the middle classes that suffer first followed by the entire government collapsing under the weight of corruption and chaos.
Now, I’m all for being healthy and fit. I am currently on my own fitness quest, though I’ll spare you the before pictures. But I have lived long enough and far exceeded the maximum paleolithic lifespan to have learned a simple truth. Moderation is the key. A little butter or bacon or barbecue or tiramisu won’t kill you. And it definitely adds to the deliciousness of life.

We all got ready and left fairly early just to get her to stop asking us when we were going to go bye bye. This meant that we got to the theater early. I figured she’d be easily amused by the sights and sounds and would have no issues waiting from 2:00 p.m. ‘til 2:40 when the movie would start.
Most of you all have probably heard the saying, song, or whatever, "Life is just a bowl of cherries". This song has been playing in my head the whole time I was putting this card together and I don't even know any other words to it....Hence, the cherry charm. I changed the words to "Fun is just a tub of bubbles" to go with the image for a birthday that's coming up in January.

The cost of Aeropostal items may be stated to become in between that of Express or Gap that is much more costly, and Old Navy that is less expensive. This tends to make the brand a preferred amongst numerous simply because it combines affordability with fantastic style. Therefore, it is now 1 with the biggest clothes companies within the marketplace.

I’m not a big steak person so giving up beef isn’t that big a deal. I converted to turkey burgers a long time ago, only eating beef burgers from time to time. I eat pork a couple of times a year, usually ham for holidays and my family recipie of chopped North Carolina Style bbq (also known as pulled pork). I make that like once in the summer. Once again, I happily replaced pork bacon with turkey bacon in my diet.
Do this for yourself. You deserve it and so does your family. Think of it this way, you're really spending that $39 not only on yourself but on your family as well. Having a calmer, more organized mom with more time to spend on the important things rather than trying to come up with all of this on her own is truly such a blessing to all members of the family. You'd spend $39 (or more) taking them out to eat wouldn't you? (Ok, so maybe on a special occasion you would. A trip to McDonald's for our family is around $28-$30!) Just think how much longer this will actually last and bless you and your family. I plan on using this and reading through the articles and information over the course of the whole school year. That averages out to a mere $3.25 a month! Now seriously, who can't afford to spend $3.25 on themselves?!
Some may agure that extending unemployment is not the answer, but without this small amount of help many will do without. It is not for lack of trying as jobs are almost non exsistant today. The only thing that is stopping the United States from returning to the unemployment rates of the depression is unemployment benifits. Yet, now the republicans, think the best thing to do is block this legislation.

Whatever they say, I’m not listening. I’m just ignorant enough to stay that way in my happy little bubble of belief that there are others like me who do not wish to engage in a series of processes to see which will prove successful, but rather a “real” connection based on healthy communication and sincerity.
The stories are wonderfully offbeat and the style is pulpy and breathless. There are various malevolent figures working for the German Empire who seem to be inspired by fictional diabolical criminal masterminds such as Dr Fu Manchu. In fact the tone is a bit like Sax Rohmer’s Fu Manchu stories but with more technology and more science, albeit weird fringe science. A cross between the Fu Manchu books and Buck Rogers.
I’ll finish off with a picture I alluded to in my previous posting about the 10 soles bill as I found an image of an older note with the upside-down plane. Enjoy.
I remember being young and listening to my parents discuss how in England, young unmarried pregnant girls were being supported by the State via generous welfare and free housing. As young as I was, even I realised that this was not a good thing as it would only lead to more and more young girls getting pregnant to get the same benefits. Today England sits in crisis on all fronts. In South Africa at that time, it was a huge scandal to be at school, unmarried and pregnant. The pregnant girls usually left school in disgrace to have their baby and then completed their education elsewhere. When did that thinking change? Why is it no longer a scandal? Because do-gooders around the world thought they knew best and started guilting us into accepting all kinds of anti-social behavior. They wanted our societies to be more interracial (!). They wanted gays to be allowed out in the open (and now married). They wanted more abortions (now late-term abortion is acceptable). They wanted drugs to legalised (cannabis already is). They wanted girls to be able to have babies at a young age and then be supported for the rest of their lives. They keep pushing the envelope until there is a cave in. Pretty soon the deluge of girls dropping out of school to have their welfare babies started. In South Africa, the ANC announced welfare to all mothers earning under a certain amount. Bang - out popped hundreds of thousands of fatherless babies, just so the mother could get claim welfare money. Of course they don't think a little further - that these kids cost you for the rest of your life and that they grow up repeating the cycle. No, that's what the government is for - they are responsible for looking after their kids - that would be you, Mr and Mrs Tax Payer. This is also the reason why the majority of Blacks in America vote for the Democrats, their enablers. Cradle to grave welfare. Michigan is finally getting it, but how do they tackle the problem? It's not so easy to put the Genie back in the bottle once out. The common sense answer is staring everyone in the face, but the PC police won't have it. Just STOP the welfare.
For years, I struggled, trying to hear God’s voice, hearing it, then doubting if it was really God. My doubt screamed at me so loud, and I was screaming so hard back, that I wasn’t even listening. Everyone has their own language with God. How he talks with me isn’t how he talks with you. Well, some of it is, because there are forms of communication that is pretty good—but DON’T underestimate ANYTHING.

“You guys want to hear some more old shit or what?” Billie Joe Armstrong says before opening the track “Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?” and adds after strumming a few notes, “This song is my favorite song from Kerplunk by the way.” Armstrong’s energy and enthusiasm pumps me up every time I listen to this part of the album. Much like attending one of their shows, Green Day keeps you entertained and somehow builds upon your excitement with each subsequent song. The album Insomniac is finally represented with “Geek Stink Breath” and like the previous five songs, a classic song will always be great no matter what.

Sharing rooms is also a productions trick to save money. when your on location with the same people all day the last thing you want is to be stuck with them all night, often with runners you will never have met the other runner you are sharing with either. This is a nightmare, do they snore? Will they hog the bathroom? Will they be tidy? On one production they decided to stick the runners in their own cottage, two girls and three boys all sharing one working shower that was located in the girls room. Hideous. Having boys wondering into your room in the morning to shower and leaving bits of themselves in there. Disgusting. But this was luxury compared to my next accommodation.
-ADIOS, NIRVANA by Conrad Wesselhoeft -- this one's not out yet, but I just finished reading an ARC courtesy of netgalley and it is AMAZING. Like, the male POV version of The Sky is Everywhere, but without the romance. So, so good (I should state that this book is repped by my agency, but I didn't actually know that when I read it. So.).
Laura began to cry. Not the great, heaving sobs of hours ago when Hayley had returned without her daughter, but very simple, honest tears that rolled down her porcelain skin without affecting any other part of her. The tears were warm against her cheeks, and it was only this that made her realise the pimples on her flesh were not there out of fear, but rather because she was cold.

Yesterday I spoke to a few of the newb group and it looks like our sessions have come to an end. With new jobs, surgeries, moves and scheduling I decided to end it. A couple of the goers, younger guys, were disappointed, but understood. I told them I would print out a couple copies of the rules for them (probably S&W core or complete I'm not sure) so they can run their own old school game with a group of their friends. They already have the dice. I told them all they really need is a set of the rules and some paper and pens.

"You're not short- you're fun-sized!"
The first of these answers might seem to be justified by the fact that, in the memorable words of our Lord to Nicodemus, the birth by water and that of the Spirit seem to be spoken of as elements in the same great change; and by the further fact that the Apostles seem ever to refer to the moment of Baptism as the time when that change took place. But a small amount of reflection suffices to show that to this view there are many and insuperable objections. A large amount of confusion of thought has been caused on this subject by the habit of theorising on the subject of infant Baptism, and the benefits that are believed to flow from it, instead of basing our conclusions on that which was actually revealed with respect to the Baptism of adults. Few will have the temerity to affirm that the mere process of baptizing an adult, whatever his moral condition or attitude, will produce real spiritual regeneration. A man may submit to baptism merely because the chief of his tribe has become a nominal Christian, and he desires to keep in his favour; or he may be baptized, as multitudes of Jews recently were in Russia, merely to escape persecution. To suppose that, in response to a sacrilegious abuse of the sacrament, the Holy Ghost confers on the recipient the blessing of regeneration, and works in him, as the reward of his impiety, the greatest and most beneficent change that supernatural power can effect, is to come perilously near blaspheming the Holy Ghost. But as soon as the admission is made that the act of Baptism does not produce regeneration in such cases, logic constrains us to conclude that Baptism is not the cause of regeneration; nor is it even, if we regard God Himself as the cause, a condition upon which it is absolutely dependent. In such cases as we have suggested unquestionably the man is not regenerated; but he may become so, if he comply with certain other conditions ; that is to say, if he subsequently exhibits that frame of mind which ought to have accompanied his Baptism. His regeneration, then, will have been dependent, on man’s side, not on his Baptism, but on the sincerity of his repentance and the reality of his faith.
Welcoming Lucy to the World:
Tammy and I spent Friday cruising the grounds at the Minnesota State Fair. We caught a bus from the Burnsville transit station and paid $5 for round trip tickets for us each. We planned to be back around 6 or 7 that night but we were having too nice of a time to pack it in so soon. I called my neighbor Mark to see if he could possibly let the pups out for us and he was kind enough to do that and would accept payment in the form of a pale of Sweet Martha's Cookies. He was only joking but I thought it made for a nice trade-off.
Wipe down the handles and light switches and anything that gets touched on a daily basis. Also, make sure you dust and vacuum. That apartment has been sitting for quite some time since the last tenant and professional cleaner, and maybe it was even shown to a few potential renters before you. Dust the tops of the doors and the storage railings in the closets and any other surface.
The Last Word is an easy and delightful book to read. Benn does a great job of drawing the reader into the story, helping us to see ourselves in the disciples and in turn, points us to the comforting last words of Jesus as the source of life. This book would be a great devotional and with the study questions in the back it would make for a helpful Bible study guide for a small group. This is the kind of book every Christian can benefit from as they dive into the final words of Jesus.

Naturally, eating will give you energy. You can get food by planting and harvesting crops and animals. You can use them to buy meals from the marketplace. There are 7 meals in the market you can choose from. They range from light snacks to all you can eat meals.
This is another piece that sold at Susan Powell Fine Art before I could even post it here. I really like how this one turned out. It is what I strive for in my work. A balance of warm and cool, light and dark, and tight and loose.
Roberts is a masterful storyteller in how she develops her characters. I can see why she has written so many books. She does a great job of building the back story behind the characters. However, what made this story hard for me was that I didn't really like the main character, Mackensie Elliot (aka "Mac") very much. I couldn't get behind her to root for her and the issues that she was facing with her family and her relationships. There were many points of the book that I just wanted to say to Mac, "Get over it!"

Israel did not just steal most of the Palestinian land. With the excuse of terrorism it also controls the little that it left for the Palestinian people. In the little spit the Palestinians have, Israel has created a buffer zone, to protect itself. This so called ‘conflict zone’ is in an area where Palestinian tend their fields. Needless to say, the Palestinians are angry. So are those who support their cause.
In case you don't know, they serve gluten free noodle for those who are allergic. They do have normal pasta too, but why not give that a try? They use quinoa noodles, and it's pretty close to normal pasta texture. The mac and cheese has 5 types of cheese. It has Swiss, mozzarella, parmesan, cheddar, and fontina cheese. To be honest, I can't tell what fontina cheese tasted like, but with the combination with all of them worked for me. It's cheesy for sure. Not as cheesy as the ones I've had at BRC, but at a stromy night, that will do.
10. Tianjin: I have never really had the desire to live in a Big City, but Tianjin definitely is that(around 13 million people). Tianjin is really beautiful though, and has a very international flair, and I feel so blessed to live here. I would highly recommend googling “Tianjin at Night” images, to just have an idea of the beautiful city I get to experience every time I go into town.
“Governor Palin will change the dynamics of the entire presidential race,” she said. “Her admirable record of confronting corruption and living her pro-life convictions shows she is a doer, not just a talker. Sarah Palin will make history as a vice presidential candidate – and not simply because she’s a woman, but because she’s a woman of substance and character.”
Finally, I love how concrete the details of the Toronto setting are. O’Connell uses street names and landmarks a lot, such that reading World sometimes felt like taking a walk/bike ride/drive around the city. I especially love that O’Connell even gives Mississauga a shout-out. Maggie spends some time in Port Credit (in southern Mississauga), and her description, making it sound so different from the city, almost like a quaint little town. Grace O’Connell is already Random House of Canada’s New Face of Fiction; I can imagine Magnified World entering the canon of Toronto literature because it gives such a sense of place.

what i love about this collaboration most of all, in retrospect, is that it formed a bond amongst the 15 artists that is still there today; our "leader", lynne perrella, still sends out group letters to us all that will trigger responses from quite a few of us in return. we talk of art, and food, and books, and museum visits, we remember childhood stories, childhood dreams. even today lynne sent out a letter talking about housecleaning, purging, airing things for spring and how good all of that feels.

It cannot be said that binding demons or the souls of the dead for such purposes is necessarily appealing, or even ethical, in modern magical practice, though it still does occur. It is even less appealing to inflict such curses and bindings on someone from whom one wishes to have erotic and romantic favors. This kind of violent manipulation is one of many things that gave magic a bad name in ancient times. It’s an interesting historical curiosity, but it is something that we don’t necessarily have to carry on in the modern world, when there are better ways to handle such things. Picking up the phone and calling the person, or crossing the crowded dance floor and saying “Hello” are both acts that are simpler, faster, and though often requiring more courage, are also often more immediately effective, and just as magical in potentially every way.

A dark intense story by Richard Godwin involving slavery, which looks at the genesis and workings of Roman's lycanthropy.
However, even people who have come here legally disagree with Ludwick’s point of view. “Education is one of those things that should not rely on one’s immigration status. Educated individuals make a better society regardless of where they live,” said Miral Bessed, a UO student who immigrated legally to the U.S. from Pakistan 10 years ago. “I know plenty of people who are born and raised here and have all the benefits, but do not care about obtaining education. If someone has the drive and the commitment to attain knowledge, I believe it’s only fair to facilitate it for them.”
Mama Dazz and I met up with an old friend of hers a few weeks later at Walker’s Grille for lunch. I had the same dish as before: trout en papillote. This is the only fish dish I’ve ever had that I can remember eating the entire thing, skin and all. Both times the fish was light and moist, flaky and melt-in-your-mouth delectable, and it is light enough to match whatever time of day you are craving it. I hope to recreate this dish in the summer, but to continue on with my story…

But the real pleasure in this show is the snappy dialogue. You don’t have to understand much about the characters to see the beauty in this quote. Raylan, U.S. Marshall is threatening Boyd, childhood friend, adult frenemy. Theirs is an odd relationship, but for the purpose of this quote, you only need to know that Raylan has just found out that Boyd used Raylan’s aunt’s house as an Oxy clinic. In addition to the other problems in his life, this makes Raylan a bit uptight.

I’m so sad that I didn’t get the opportunity to give her the grand tour of Miranda (our campervan) as I’d promised her I would. I wish I had realised that I didn’t have as much time as I thought I did to do that, but that was Denise for you. She’d outlived her initial prognosis by leaps and bounds and somehow she seemed to me to be invincible (I’d been very worried about her back in Jan/Feb but her attitude made me think I was being ridiculously pessimistic and so I snapped myself out of it and went back to thinking she was invincible). She wasn’t the sort of person to wallow in self pity; always downplaying her troubles and always so much more interested in helping other people; even when she’d had a bad day she’d be looking forward to the good one that was just around the corner. I will never ever not be awe inspired by her courage, her joie de vivre, and I will treasure my memories of her always.

Melodrama: Pretty self-explanatory. In trying to be too exciting, the developer will make the opening sequence so melodramatic that it's impossible to take seriously. This is obviously a bad thing when the game isn't meant to be goofy and it will instantly put people off continuing with the game.

We go a step or two further than some. If we should happen to stumble upon something we had never even thought about, that would be absolutely and completely right for someone in our family, well, that is a definite mitzvah, a blessing! (Hey, I'm playing a Jewish mother in my upcoming show....it wears off, you know?) If we find that something we know in our hearts, will touch the recipient with some emotional connection, well, we know it will be "The Best Gift". I wrote about this breifly in a previous post, (from a Christmas-Past.) The ultimate, most successful and wonderful-est gift is the one that brings the tears.
So where does that leave me. Well I agreed to a party—small, but there was real chocolate cake and some of our closest friends. That was a big step in the right direction. My dearest handled the birthday event. He has done so even though I have been non-committal and just plain difficult about it. I think he was willing to let me not let anyone do anything for my birthday, but not particularly happy about it. All I could think about was having an event that marks the fact that I am another year older. But I am okay with that–yes, I am able to handle the happy birthday party. I am even fine with some ugly over-the-hill cards. Laughing at my age, at my age, is good for the soul.

Assuming you aren’t weirded out by the artwork then LotFP shines as pretty much the tightest version of D&D ever. This virtue comes across most clearly in the section devoted to what I call “operations”, i.e. how to open a door or check for traps or crap like that. Most reviews of most D&D descendants (and many whole games!) completely skip this stuff because it's usually boring to read, but in actual dungeoneering play these mechanics are crucial. LotFP delivers the best, most coherent set of operations rules I’ve ever seen.

It is interesting to note, that there is no reference to David’s sin against Bathsheba and Uriah in the Book of Chronicles. This could be due to Chronicles focusing on the kings of Judah, from which Jesus’s lineage came. However, we do see that there were many evil kings of the Southern Kingdom as well.
Saturday morning I decided I would finish trimming and hauling the holly hedge. This is an undertaking because it's 2oo linear feet of hedges and uphill hauling. As the clock rolled around to mid afternoon I noticed some of the bushes were looking droopy. This is not a good sign. I never get too worried when the annuals go to drooping but when the shade growing bushes get the droop it is an indication of urgent need. So I turned the sprinklers on and went to fetch bags of mulch.

While the Overall was a palate ripping bitter hop bomb this is a more tempered affair, not a full-frontal assault more of a measured bombardment, but still with masses of flavour and complexity. It pours a muddy orange amber with a rocky tan-coloured head. The aroma is like smelling a sharp, tart and bitter orange coffee marmalde with a wet ashiness giving you a big hint of what's in store. It's slightly oily but also drying on the palate, with citric coffee and orange peel and honeyed nougat flavours washing through before seemingly pooling on the centre of the tongue, pushing a big pine lemony nutty grapefruit aroma up into and completely filling the nose. A citrussy hoppy maltiness in the aftertaste leaves a wispy smokey roast bitter coffeeness playing in the mouth and nose, and an intense dry bitterness drying slowly on the back of the throat.

However, there are also some paintings from his time spent in America when he was better known for his paintings of Californian swimmings pools than English landscapes. Some of his paintings were originally iPad sketches which he has transferred to canvas. One of his old lecturers from his days as a student in his home town of Bradford has described his work as that of a decorator. I only wish that I could decorate half as well as him.
Shouting 'fire' in a crowded room is not the excercise of free speech, and preaching race hatred, especially in a city which knows such relative deprivation and has remarkably harmonious and wide racial diversity, should not be protected as a right, but clearly seen for what it is, vindictive and malicious poison.

Romney Also Alleged That The National Rifle Association Endorsed Him In 2002 - Another Mistake. "Romney claimed on the NBC News program 'Meet the Press' last Sunday that he received from the National Rifle Association while running for governor of Massachusetts in 2002, when it turned out the group had never endorsed him." (The New York Times, 12/22/07)
Hashimoto notices in his work that any cultural bearing that kites have also carry a cultural and political dimension. As the delicate rice paper frames stand suspended or hang out from the wall, the solid graphic symbols, not quite recognizable, bring the viewer quietly into a world where kites can serve as release from political tyranny or the day to day rigor of life. Hashimoto tries to weave his formal concerns with the visual social reality around him. In this pursuit, he is successful. While the sculptures serve as a quite brilliant reflection of sculpture and painting, they also present a festive quality of a pageant. When the kites form a cave, somewhere between flight and enclosure, they call attention to the limits of the room, serving as passages out of the room and as chains to stay in the room. Such limits are constantly imposed by society as well and the Hashimoto teaches us this beautiful lesson.
At 7pm, I told the kids to shut off all electronics, and start on their chores. In about an hour, the house looked MUCH better. I sent the big kids to their rooms to read, and helped the little kids clean their room. I helped them with their prayers, tucked them in, and turned out the light. I had to go back in about 5 minutes later for something, and realized that they were both awake. And sleeping in the same bed.
You’re wondering if it is really worth it though. Absolutely! You can get people to check in sporadically for sales, coupon codes, new releases etc… but if you give people something they feel they are a part of they will check back far more regularly just to see what is happening with it. You’ll get your visitors not only engaging with you, but with your other visitors as well. This helps foster positive feelings about your brand and that is something you can’t buy.

I then jumped out of bed and ran downstairs to get them. In the process, I hit my hip on my dresser, stubbed my toe on my door frame, and stumbled down the stairs, my body unable to keep up with the speed that I demanded of it. I raced over to my purse, rummaging through every inch of it until I found them. “Aha!”, I said aloud, and raised the glasses up in the air, triumphantly. “Got ‘em!”

Today at work I found myself writing bad poems whenever I took a break. I don’t know why. I don’t write poems often. But I can be consistently bad at it. I tweeted about it, and someone asked to share one. So, here you go, dear reader, a bad poem from a work break:
When it's cold they huddle together for warmth, when their father comes home and beats them they take it together, and when they play it's rough or involves them hunting together like a pack. Their mother works graveyard shifts at the local brewery, often getting confused as to what time of day or even day it is. The boys learn not to correct her after a while, it being easier than the time she tried to send Joel next door at midnight to get butter so she could make a cake for Manny
If being in school is like riding a train, then traditional homeschooling is like riding in a car. Your parents are driving and you get to sit with your brothers and sisters if you have any. But other than these two common elements, the details of the car ride can vary greatly, depending on your parents' views on education.

Sounds great! The movie creates all the stardust that Hollywood is famous, or infamous, for. But really think about it. Would you give up everything about your life to be with someone new? Tommy knew Fiona for one day. He met practically everyone in the village. The village population might swell over time, but it would never appreciably diminish. He would never drive a car again. He would never drink an old-fashioned again or listen to jazz. He would not see his family or friends again or go to a job in a high-rise again. Could you let that go? No electricity? No TV, movies, or libraries?
* Gina Samardge (Princess Penny), the accordionist, used to play with the Main Squeeze Orchestra, which is not a bit surprising.

(She is not only a teacher but a children’s entertainer. And, baby, both of those jobs take guts).

One of these associates, the Sabah solicitor Richard Christopher Barnes, was arrested and held in custody, along with Michael Chia, at the time of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation into Sabah timber corruption back in 2010. Huge volumes of documents were confiscated from Barnes’ offices by investigators, who prepared a major prosecution case.
So today we celebrate the Equinox with a Hindu holiday called Nyepi. It’s basically a day of purification when Hindus (and anyone living in Bali) may not use any technology AT ALL. Everything shuts down. No traffic, no pedestrians, no home appliances, no TeeVee, and no one leaves the house. The Hindus spend outrageous amounts of money on something called ogoh-ogoh. These are elaborate constructs designed to entice and trap various spirits that ‘pollute’ the realm of the living throughout the rest of the year. Folks place them in front of their homes and groups get together and erect huge ones in public areas.
Contrary to popular belief, I’ve learned over time that dating is not always the first step when you meet someone with whom there is a mutual attraction. Sure, you may go on a date or two, but typically we all find some way to distinguish that period of time from the ever ambiguous, even though it really shouldn’t be all that complicated time of dating.
I decided that even with their warnings I still wanted to try and live in Canjayar. I began asking around if anyone knew if there were people looking for roommates, or apartments to rent. It was a bit of an adventure. I asked and one place and they told me to go with someone to ask someone else, who might have an apartment to rent. I did that and I met Domingo, who is possibly the cutest old man ever. He put my hands in his, gave me two kisses on the cheek and welcomed me to Canjayar. Then began our attempt to communicate. I thought I was understanding him, and then it was obvious I wasn’t. He was at a class, and in came in his teacher to tell me that she offered a Spanish classes. I started asking her if she knew anything about people looking for room mates, because that is what I thought she was talking about. Anyway, I met Domingo and his daughter, who lives in an apartment on the top floor of the town hall, and had an apartment to rent. Well not an apartment as much as a house. It wouldn’t have worked, because I would have had to live alone. This became the big problem, there was no one who needed a room mate. After an afternoon of looking and asking around it was obvious that there wasn’t anything. I had to be in Almeria the next morning for an orientation meeting so I rode with another teacher to the city. I stayed at a hostel (with out an elevator so I had to drag my 3 suitcases up the stairs).
Who knows, perhaps my word will gain popularity and become the common term for that. Wouldn’t that be cool?

one about the cheerleading competition I photographed last week.
Industrial Self Adhesives Ltd v Teknek Ltd and others [2012] EWPCC 10, 8 March 2012, took a look at a variation on a theme that is becoming increasingly common these days -- the question whether the settlement of a case actually finishes it off or whether there is scope for further fiddling around with it. The Chancery Division, England and Wales, recently visited this question in a different context, involving a post-settlement consent order in a trade mark infringement action which was subsequently challenged for, among other things, breach of EU competition law (see IPKat post here). In that case, the strong public interest in the finality of a dispute settlement was emphasised. Industrial Self Adhesives Ltd v Teknek was however exploring a different post-settlement issue: might the Patents County Court for England and Wales amend a patent post-settlement.

No vintage for Kitty style this week. My bedroom is a mountain of clean washing that needs putting away and Kitty's room is pretty much in the same state so rather than chose a particular outfit this week we played pull some random clothes from the washing pile. This little gap dress was a fave last year and it still fits but is a little short. We teamed it with an old wash worn pair of navy leggings also from gap and a pom pom hairclip from gymboree. I would have put her red chucks on to complete the look but as you can see from the last pic Kitty had a little skateboarding accident the other day and has scraped the skin off the top of her feet. Obviously she is not keen on shoes right now so while we are home she is barefoot. I'm not sure what she was doing in these photos but it sure was making me dizzy.

Let me start by saying this one should have been lower. I think I let my affection for Demetri Martin's one-man shows and his charmingly quirky style override my good sense. Which isn't to say this isn't a great comedy album, full of great one-liners and word play and one of the highest LPM (laughs per minute, coined by Martin as he opens his set with 3 jokes in five seconds) in the business. That extremely high LPM is a function of both Martin's superb writing and delivery and his habit of keeping jokes only as long as they need to be and no more, often forgoing the set-up entirely and diving straight into the punchline, which works better than you'd expect. Martin frequently mixes music into his set, such as on "Sames and Opposites," and "Personal Information Waltz," both of which are about what you're thinking they're about (things that are the same and other things that are opposites, and Martin telling "true" things about himself set to a waltz). As just a string of jokes, it lacks the cohesion of his one man shows, but when the japes are this good it doesn't really matter.

And the secret to book marketing is that there is no secret, or at least not a secret you can count on repeating time after time. Even New York publishers with all their millions and industry contacts strike out about 80 percent of the time. There's no silver bullet, only a loaded gun. I've bought ads and book sponsorships and placements at nearly every ebook site in town. Some work better than others, and some work but not consistently. I am now applying my experience to eBookSwag with my partner Michelle and our staff. It's a mixture of lessons I have learned: giveaways, audience building, good books, fun, a community, everyone wins.
As for your MD boyfriend/prospect/ex, don’t be an online stalker, okay? I remember how Liam had to block Ara and Ara’s relatives from his Facebook because Ara was messaging Liam non-stop and stalking him through the accounts of her relatives. If you recall, Liam trusted me enough to give me his password so I could increase his security settings then. Ladies, don’t be an Ara who had to be blocked by an MD from the latter’s account.

Foreign speculation over an eventual ideological succession isn’t a justifiable cause for concern other than if that nation, have political agendas to undermine another nation’s domestic political affairs and national liberty. The Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) was gaining increasing control over Sukarno’s regime which alarmed the United States a great deal. The US government with the CIA staged several coup attempts using Indonesia’s army as a proxy. However, it failed to unseat Sukarno mostly due to his loyal generals. In a desperate diplomatic move to unseat Sukarno, the US publicly announced that all aid to Indonesia will cease. This of course is a lie. The US continued to "increase" its support toward strengthening the Indonesia’s army. To keep the American activities below the radar, instead of funding through government agencies (which keeps detailed financial records), private individuals and American oil companies like Stanvac and Caltex were put as the middle men bankrolling crucial army operations.
I love my husband. He’s the other half of me. I know that’s not exactly cool to say, but it’s true. He makes all the other love I ever felt before feel like swimming in a tepid, plastic, wading pool. He makes all the feelings I’ve ever felt feel like a sneeze. Sure, they were satisfying, but in the end, they were fleeting.

As with all commissions involving people, it isn't a portrait of either Janey or her cat, but rather a painting of her sadness and of a girl and a cat that might be Janey or someone else.

Music has a great effect on me. A some what weird effect also, you could say. For one, some body appendage is always moving when I’m listening to music. Either my foot is tapping, or my leg is shaking, or the most noticeable, my head is bobbing. Considering that I’m listening to music almost all the time, one of these things is always happening. Foot tapping is fine as long as it isn’t too loud. On occasion, that also happens. In the bus or in my cubicle, loud foot taps, and I don’t realize it because my earphones are drowning all other sounds around me. The head bobbing, or should I say entire body swaying, is something that quite some people notice, and when I notice that they’re noticing, there’s two things I resort to doing. Some times, like a regular person, I stop or reduce the intensity of my ‘dance’. Other times, me being me, I continue dancing, may be even increasing the intensity of the head bobbing, BOOYAH!

Happy Friday lovelies! I have a monochromic look to share with you today. I usually don't wear one colour all over unless it's more of a neutral shade like beige or brown. But berries and burgundies are my fave makeup shade for eyes, cheeks and lips so I thought why not where them everywhere on my face! MAC Smoke Signal pigment remains one of my top favourite pigments of all time and it's a must for a look like this. I'm so glad I have it, it compliments all berry, purple and burgundy shades very nicely and can also be used to achieve a gorgeous burgundy smokey eyes (ideal on hazel and green eyes). Georgio Armani Red Lust Eyes to Kill e/s is also a great shade to accompany a look like this. I soooo need more Eyes to Kill shades, it's been a year since I bought this one and still haven't got around to collecting more.

It's the story of (would you have ever guessed?) the wife of a pilot. Kathryn's husband has flown passenger planes on transatlantic routes for years, and she has grown accustomed to the infrequency and irregularity of his time at home with her and their fifteen-year-old daughter, Mattie. But even though she is used to Jack being away often, nothing could have prepared her for the news she receives in the middle of the night: the plane Jack was piloting has gone down.

I’m so thankful that that mindset is now a thing of the past. I am moved to tears to see all of the beautiful ways families are now encouraged to celebrate the short lives of their tiny babies. We are able to not only create memories, but we’re able to preserve them with foot prints, hand prints, locks of hair, and photographs. Proof to us and the world that our treasured babies EXISTED even if only for a short time.
If all editions of the Work in the USA and Canada which have been published or licensed by the Publisher are out of print, and if, within six (6) months after written demand by the Author or the Author's representative, the Publisher does not agree to provide within an additional six (6) months adequate stock to meet the normal demand for the Work, or to arrange for a reprint or book-club edition...this Agreement will forthwith terminate and all rights in the Work will revert to the Author...The Work shall be considered in print if it is for sale by the Publisher in any edition, or if it is under option or license granted by the Publisher. This used to be all that was needed. Books were physical objects only; they took up room in warehouses, and when they stopped selling in significant numbers it was in the publisher's interest to clear warehouse space by removing them from sale and pulping them or selling them to remainder dealers (especially after the Supreme Court's 1979 decision in the Thor Power Tools case made warehousing more expensive).

As you relax into the strength, there is no bottom and there is no bad. As you relax into the power Shaun, let the strength trickle through you. Let the strength run through your body from the top of your head to the tip of your toes. Let the soft gentle strength run through you and flush out doubts, fear and things that were never really true. Even if they were true as a child Shaun, they were never true. You just happened to be there. Now you can see the truth.”

Being held hostage by what the wind and the rains could do drove us more than a little nuts. Only so many goods can be baked, so many games played, so much shut-eye acquired. I know my grandparents were probably more than a little disappointed to find that this storm didn't require us to evacuate - if Lee had become a full-fledged hurricane, we'd have headed up to my parents' in Oklahoma City where, coincidentally, my grandparents happened to be visiting this past weekend. After having checked the Gulf Coast surf reports early Monday morning in a last-ditch gesture of eternal hope that was dashed on discovering the possible wave heights, I found myself wishing we'd piled into the car and gone anyhow, even if the closest body of water we'd be near would be the artificial Lake Hefner. Maybe if I were experiencing all of this by myself, things would've been different, but the cabin fever my husband was suffering was highly contagious.

Part of what makes us more fruitful is God working in us in pruning us. This is the Greek word καθαίρει the present, indicative, active form of καθαίρω or kathairō. This is the act of purification or cleansing to make something free from filth. God does this in all of us to make us more fruitful in His Kingdom. This can sometimes hurt. He takes away some things that we have our hearts set on. He changes our lives in ways we would not choose. He may take away our health, our job, whatever it takes to purify us to make us Kingdom ready to make us free from any improper mixture or contamination of the world and its ways.

Being in a band as a hobby, not a steady job, takes up most of your energy. Steini had a wife and a son in 1987. He wasn’t all that interested in "rock" music anymore and leaned towards classical guitar music. He wanted to quit, but before he did we convinced him of doing two things: making another record and playing with The Sugarcubes on their first major UK tour. We played only three gigs on the Sugarcubes tour, the biggest one being at the London Astoria for about 2.000 people, which was of course the largest crowd we'd ever played to. This was a nice time for us; we got to eat exotic food, get very drunk and get close to famous people backstage. The record was fittingly called 'Bless' and had four songs. Sigurjón Kjartansson from Ham produced this 12" EP. I rehearsed with Ham for a while in the summer of 1988, but played only one gig with them though. With Steini out of the picture, Biggi and I formed a new band (fittingly called Bless, to promote the recently released EP, ‘S. H. Draumur’) with Ari Eldon of Sogblettir.
Fabulous! A gay ice cream party! I love it! And I love that these are all regular sounding desserts. Everyone tries to be so fancy and unique with their cakes and stuff, they don’t make vanilla, it’s marzipan instead, or, you know the cheesecake has gooseberries or something gross on it. Have you watched any of the shows on the Food Network lately? It’s horrifying. The host will start off making something good, like a chocolate cake. They’ll bake it and put it on a plate and it’s looking all yummy, but then, in a misguided effort to seem sophisticated and unique they’re like “And now we’ll make the icing, which will be a mango chutney salsa spread,” or something equally as bad and I’m watching like “Noooooo! Stop you’re ruining it!”
In closing, I have to say this subject is a tip of an enormous iceberg of high “social capital” people have the right of way of whoring attention of the disorder, while lower “social capital” (PC for being a “hick”) gets treated like crap.
Speech is one of the most refined fine-motor functions in the body. Several sensory systems need to work together for speech to develop and progress. These include the auditory (listening), visual (looking), tactile (touch), and proprioceptive (inner awareness in the muscles and joints) systems. When the sensory systems work together, a child’s attention can also improve. Attention, focus, and concentration are needed for all motor learning (including speech). Pediatric occupational therapists assess and treat sensory processing disorders.

Corin Roscoe, an antiques store owner, is a man fighting fears relatable to us all: ones with family, with friends, with God. His days are haunted with harsh realities and his nights by dreams of horrific incidents endured. He reaches many crossroads in this book: does he hang onto fear or face it? Hang onto guilt or seek forgiveness? Deny the truth or accept it? And when life offers him a choice between the easy road or the high road–when the easy road will spare him further struggles–which does he choose?
Once released from the misery of enforced running, I didn’t look back for a very long time, and thought I never would. Running was boring and painful, especially without a companion. But the specter of poor health and weight gain has loomed larger as we get older. Neither is an immediate threat, but a couple of years ago I could easily I imagine that if I kept up my same non-exercising, ice-cream-loving lifestyle for decades, both would be – and John had similar thoughts and concerns. At the time, we were both grad students and on slim grad student incomes, and could think of nothing cheaper than buying running shoes and heading out the door. I impressed myself: I kept up an every-other-day running regimen for several months, until the busy-ness of the fall semester and the boringness of it kicked in, and holiday travel disrupted our schedules, and that was an end of it.
When I turned 12 my parents decided to send me to a week long summer camp. I realize now that this was just an excuse for getting me and my brother out of the house so my parents could have some quality alone time. But for me it was a big step. I had never been away from family for that length of time. I was scared but at the same time I was also excited.
Enchanted is an adorable novel in its entirety. From the Woodcutter family to the royal family, sinister secrets and magics abound, and I could not seem to stop turning the pages, driven by a need to know what happened next. As lead characters, Sunday and Rumbold were a charming duo, and I enjoyed seeing both of their points of view. I thought the conflicts keeping them apart were really well done, both internally, as Rumbold wondered if Sunday could love him due to their tangled histories, and externally, with threats from various magical sources. The threats to their happiness felt real, which made the climax of Enchanted that much more breathless and awesome.
I go to the doctor today and of course, the dreaded scale. I step on and I want to cry as the number goes higher than it has ever been. I’m at my breaking point and it was all I could do not to cry in the doctors office. I have battled with a fluctuation in my weight my whole life. When I was a child I was on the little side, but it got to the point when I started to pack on the baby fat (as people call it). I have always been insecure and have never known my self worth. As a child my grandmother would say to me ”Oh, you shouldn’t eat that. You’re getting so big.” What child needs to hear something like that? Growing up when every thing around you is so influenced on body image due to the ideal of what Hollywood thinks a person should look like. Things haven’t changed, people haven’t changed, it’s still the same way. It’s no wonder people have so many insecurities and issues about themselves.
He remember looking at the little girl. He’d been eighteen at his blooding. And the girl, the girl had been twelve. Innocent, with wide eyes, he had known she was the type of child to spend her time studying. The type of child who was afraid of something, something that she would inevitably hold secret until the day she died. She was the kind of child such conscience should be given. But he couldn’t. Not with those eyes watching him. Not when they stared at him so widely innocent.
Surging unemployment rates from Spain to Italy and Greece are threatening efforts to quell the region’s debt crisis and keeping bond yields close to record premiums relative to benchmark German bunds.
I know those other moms are probably very nice women. I'm just not ready. I get all hive-y and uncomfortable just thinking about it. Maybe I have social anxiety. What? I can't have social anxiety? The Bloggess is allowed to use that but not me-- I'm just a cantankerous old bitch? Well, maybe...
He did not hear back from the prime minister but he says that within days, an RCMP officer was knocking on his door.
If not, now you do.
Now let me back up a little and explain. I spent Sunday with some friends on the North Shore of Oahu, You know, where everyone goes to watch the big waves and surfers trying to navigate the Banzai Pipeline.

Occasionally, these two readers turn out to be different people, when they should be the same. But, your words will reveal all ... if you're prepared to look at them objectively.

Thanks for stopping by again folks, much appreciated. LG knows that you have a lot of demands on your time on a daily basis and he thanks you for checking in once in a while over here at The LG Report. Muchos gracias.
Sometimes, even when you really like something, you have to let on like you like it EVEN MORE to satisfy the people around you. And to get out of there.

In my whole life this was the only time I ever wanted to hit my mother. How could she?
But the surprise face among the leaders was Couples, who plays mainly on the senior Champions Tour but showed has vast understanding of the course where he won his only major.
I've really enjoyed your comments and letting me know that you would like to join my Stamp Stack if you lived close enough. I sure wish we could get together. Wouldn't it be fun!
The artistic effect of the bottle wall is a way of conveying new ideas of how the Mantanani people could make something pretty out of stuff they would have normally thrown away.
I could never participate in any discussion about free speech that did not allow such a self-contradictory premise to be challenged. For one thing, I do not regard freedom of speech as an end in itself, but merely as a means towards the end of permitting people to be fully accountable for their own opinions. This means that I am not opposed to entertaining arguments over the possibility of any better mechanism to allow people total responsibility for their own beliefs. Also, if freedom of speech is really to be an axiom, then it absolutely must include freedom to advocate the end of free speech, if only to develop the countervailing argument.
Actress Michelle Williams channels the international megablond who captured the heart of a baseball player, an American President, a best selling novelist, and left indelible screen images in everything from The Seven Year Itch to the haunting Misfits. Oscar buzz has already begun and she certainly looks the part. The film also starts Judi Dench and Kenneth Branaugh.
The mental mind-fucking that goes on while waiting is absolutely incredible. I was doing everything that I knew I shouldn’t be doing – I wasn’t trusting my “inner self” – I was second guessing everyone and everything. Thank God I’d given up drinking years earlier – I’m quite certain that if I hadn’t, I’d have brought an entirely new definition of “The Ides of March” to the forefront.
In a South London pub.
As I stated in January, my talented consigliere, Gregg, was ticketed for carrying a sign that was "too big"--according to some arcane local ordinance. This will be at least a $135 fine, possibly more. He has asked for a jury trial.

Hey Cara mia, let's leave this boring opera and head home for a little boffiati.

No, local brewing is nothing new at all, but it is a massive fall from grace for Beck’s, which once tried to distinguish itself from all the brewed-under-licence lager brands by using the line ‘Only ever brewed in Bremen, Germany’.

A while later I presented him with this:
I picked him up this afternoon, almost unable to pick him from the line-up of little boys. One thing a uniform does is make a person blend in, right? When he spotted me, waiting to collect him, he beamed. Suddenly he stood out like a beacon.
Lissa’s uncle, Victor Dashkov, finds out Lissa can use spirit and forces his daughter to lure Lissa out, eventually kidnap Lissa and tormenting her in to healing him, because his is terminally ill. While distracting Rose and Dimitri are under a strong lust spell. This, I think is to bad, is broken off by Dimitri. And they end up saving Lissa from her uncle.
The Free Fringe is not a ‘business model’. It is a model for the liberation of performers from the chains imposed on them by others making profit on their labour. Thus, we must be a non-profit organisation. The Free Fringe is free in many senses. Among those freedoms is freedom from the (perceived, not real) need for reviews.
He's really making good progress and we have several big piles that will need to be burned come spring. This isn't a true before and after, but here is a shot of what he's starting with and how well he cleans it up (just not the same spot).
The hulking mass of unfinished brick and concrete at 20-13 35th St. is so unsightly, it became a poster child for zoning reform.
The 2004 IIFA award ceremony witnessed a contingent of over 450 stars, celebrities, cricketers, industrialists and government leaders over the festive weekend.
Plus, I have also been allowing myself not to get ‘stressed’ over things that have not been done! If the ironing is not done right now, it’s not the end of the world! If that phone call is made tomorrow rather than today, then that’s OK too! Living in the moment and allowing myself the time to get ‘back to feeling great’!
