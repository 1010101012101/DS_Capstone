The revision process can’t be word-count-centric. It’s this funny relationship between the critical brain and that freeflowing brain, the child’s brain that just wants to make stories up and weird little rules to the games. No you can’t be that! And you’re dead! And yes, kites come from Jesus and grow on trees. Or whatever. The work of that mind has to be evaluated by the other mind, and this seems so dangerous. The mind that says “Yeah that sucks pretty hard, not interesting. Nope that doesn’t make any sense either.” That’s the same mind that tells you you’re a piece of shit and can’t write and have no talent and you’re ugly besides. That mind, that aspect, has to be somehow tamed to the point where it will also admit, “OK that bit’s not too bad. I like that part.” The inner editor is a requirement, and it’s hard to keep her healthy.
........and I'm so grateful that my country doesn't have nationalized healthcare or socialized medicine so I could get a hold of the drug off label and my government couldn't restrict me. I'm willing to bet getting a hold of Kaly in Australia, England and Canada for non-G551D patients will be nearly impossible. I already know of more than a dozen here in the States, and I'm sure there are more.
She has just made me realise that its basically me who needs to start accepting the fact that my baby is actually no longer a baby. The naughty little man is going through a phase where he wants to show his mom that he too has got some powers now - power to refuse things, power to do things on his own, and that he needs a bit more freedom!
I am always amazed that these locations can take on such different characters depending on the mood of the weather, when its sunny and calm, there are kids playing on their boogie boards, a game of cricket spilling over amongst the bikini clad girls working on their tans, then the next time you look the weather has become sullen and moody, and there are threatening waves clawing the sand from the foreshore, with wind that delights in blowing your hat out to sea.

In my mind, the more important factor in determining the burden of proof is the type of study and the variables involved. Any study involving animals will generally require more evidence to refute than one based on in vitro studies. The more complex the methods, the more variables for which you have to account, perhaps the more evidence we should accumulate before collectively refuting a study–at least in the absence of evidence of fabrication or falsification. It’s still important to publish contradictory results, as this case has demonstrated. But the burden of proof should be determined by the methods not where the study is published.

The power was out this morning for over 4 hrs. It was storming. Most days like this with the rain would be excruciating for me. Today, just mild pain. :) I think I will mark off my raised beds and do some planting (if the rain stays gone now) :)

At our first meeting, Mr Mandela and I agreed to hold joint rallies throughout the country to pacify our people who had been at war with one another for so long. The first rally was scheduled for Taylor's Halt. But neither this nor any subsequent rally ever took place. After Mr Mandela agreed to go to Taylor's Halt, the ANC leadership in Natal, led by Mr Harry Gwala, arrived at Shell House (now Inkosi Luthuli House) to forbid him from attending.
Paceband: Sometimes I use one, sometimes I don't. I'm not going to cling to it, but I'll pin it inside the hem of my shirt so I can check and see where I'm at. A brand new box of Glad Press n' Seal will make sure it stays nice and waterproof, the weather is supposed to be rainy. Boo.
Measuring the lye. ALWAYS wear rubber gloves and safety glasses when handling the lye bottle, the bowl of lye, and the lye water while and after mixing. Also, always pour the lye into the distilled water, rather than the other way around.
I don’t think the Gypsy show would be my sort of gig. I don’t even think I’d want it to be! Fortunately, I would make a bad episode of “My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding”, mostly because I’m not… well, I’m not a gypsy. That said, their idea of “pimp my wedding” is on the ass-end of what I would consider a lovely wedding. I mean, there’s adding a little sparkle, a little bling to an event, and then there’s this show. That American Gypsy show reminds of what would happen if the Jersey Shore went to far and Snooki said “wow, that’s over the line”… like a Swarovski crystal nightmare. Any show where the new bride moves into a trailer after getting married should either be called “My Big Fat Redneck Wedding” or “My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding”. I swear, I think my wedding would have more in common with a redneck wedding. I’d take muddin’ over booty-shaking gypsy 5 year olds. Straight up.
So those that know anything about South Australia will know that the Premier Mike Rann has been trying to brand the state “Australia’s Defence State” or something along those lines. In short, we’re the place that builds the stuff our government uses to blow other parts of the world up. Kudos to us.

It was directed by Barrie Rutter and designed by Jessica Worrall and I enjoyed it hugely: the emotional intensity of the lives of the Brontes was powerfully shown...as was the claustrophobia of the Parsonage....the sisters talents, their hopes and their frustrations.

The sobs continued and she went to find sympathy with her (push over) father. But no, Dad backed me on the issue. A few minutes later I heard the now muffled sobs but I couldn’t place they were coming from. I went into the kitchen for a glass of water and there she was, on the lap of our babá softly sobbing into her chest, the babá stroking her hair.

Now, I don’t doubt for one nano second that those quotes represent what Ann ‘I’m the white daughter of a white millionaire and I married a white millionaire and cranked out five white boys, so of course I know what its like to raise non-white children while being non-white and making minimum wage’ Romney actually thinks about the class of people that she’s trying to con into voting for her husband.
But what is not so easy... is missing my sister and her family.

Everybody has something, though. God knows I'm a royal pain in the ass. A couple of weekends ago, Mike and I and my friend Gail went to see a show in town called Jewtopia. It was a cute celebration of Jewy-ness and one part had me convinced that I, in fact, am actually a Jew and not just a big fan of them.

I came across Famous Dave's rib rub last month while down in Topsail Isle on the North Carolina coast. Eight college buddies whom I hadn't seen in 25 years and I had a rental house for the week, so it was a drunken mess, but a LOT of great food was cooked. On the morning of the second day a couple of the guys went out early to pick up supplies for the day, many cases of beer, and a bunch of racks of both pork back and beef ribs. When I asked how they were going to prepare them they were like "well we got this dry rub - Famous Daves - it was all they had at the little market in town." I was bummed out frankly. Famous Daves, for those of you who don't know, is a chain type of rib restaurant. There's a few of them around here in Philly, I've never been to one, but I'd tried their BBQ sauce once off the supermarkt shelf and was not impressed. I did not have high hopes for this rub. I expected it to be about 80 percent salt like most commercial rubs you find in the supermarket. Boy was I wrong! The fellas dispersed a generous amount of the stuff on both the beef and the pork ribs, let it set while the fire was heating up, and four hours later VOILA! Absolutely the best tasting ribs I've ever had - BAR NONE - and that covers a lot of years and a lot of great ribs.
But no worries, I’m not done yet. I’m happy to say that after this Sunday I’ll have roughly 7 weeks off until race #7. I didn’t plan it this way but I’m glad this break is coming up.

What to look out for is a sustained reduction in movement. If baby becomes distressed in the womb, movements will reduce or stop some hours before a disaster occurs. A sustained reduction in foetal movement must therefore always be taken seriously and must always be checked out.
These days, I’m trying a new tack. I’m allowing myself to eat when I’m hungry – and my winter body is slowly losing its clout! OK, I confess, there’s a little more to it. Yes, I’m eating when I feel hungry, but I’m being a tad smarter about what I eat. I’ve stocked up on the fruit, veggies and other low-carb snacks and I’m using them as my weapons against the predictable cravings.
I think 29 is going to be a very good year!
Ma and I used to walk a lot back in the Philippines. I remember that when I was in grade five, my friends and I were fighting a lot. I was really depressed. The only thing that got me through it was walking with my mom. I really like walking. It’s a full body exercise, but you’re not stressed and sweaty. You look at the houses, the trees. Everything is moving past you.

Because on top of all this, I got strep throat.
Finally (for now) the bathroom. Apologies for the photo - the room was almost impossible to get a decent angle on (partly because it's so small). Oddly, the feature tiles above the bath have a culinary theme and are the same that appear in the kitchen (I suspect they bought in bulk).
The Fantasia is very lambic-esque, despite the fact that it wasn't brewed strictly to style. I suspect the aromatic similarity is due to the primary fermentation being carried out not only with the three yeasts and bacteria intentionally pitched but also with who knows what the fruit had on it. Fresh fruit is notorious for carrying all sorts of "wild" yeasts, and the Fantasia certainly has a pleasant complexity thanks to that. The Four Play on the other hand, a brew that has been released twice by Upright now, has used a puree from Oregon Fruit Products. I use their fruit often for all sorts of barrel aged beers. They're packaged aseptically, so there's never any surprises; the flavor is always consistent and excellent, and they're pureed so no hours and hours of destemming and cutting. I know, sucking the romance right out of it, but next time I get 800 pounds of peaches or 400 pounds of cherries, etc., I'll give you a call and you can see exactly how romantic it is after half the day has passed.
As I do my daily meditation practice through this intensely creative process, I hear the sound of my breath and the sound of my heart. I can sense the sounds of my cells receiving the oxygen from the breath and the blood flow. I sense the sounds within life, pulsing with vibrancy.

The truth is that the people of every country ought to be sharing in the wealth that each country produces: Instead the Greedy-Global-Owners keep all the profits made from resources they have basically stolen from the populations that own the forests, the minerals, the water, and the oil in every country, not to mention the land itself along with the publicly financed infrastructure, that here we are now selling off, to be turned back into foreign-owned toll-roads that were only there because we paid for them to be built in the first place.
The final session we had was back at our offices. With the memories of the course still fresh we set about planning any changes and actions that we would take to improve our teams’ functioning. I am pleased to say that I have implemented 80% of the plan I put together and the results already show. We have better connection and hence better communication within the team. Team members have commented on increased confidence following a reorganisation of roles and responsibilities and there are no grey areas left uncovered in the gaps between our respective roles. There is greater trust since I learned how to devolve responsibility for tasks and projects to be completed without being prescriptive about how they would be achieved. The final piece has been to draw up a vision and mission statement so that we can be reminded what we are aiming for and what success looks like for us. We are much more certain of the expected sales outcome much earlier in the quarter and this had a lot to do with improved planning and greater visibility and control of the deals we would work to win. Over and above we are a more focused, supportive and industrious team who rely on and trust each other to work towards our shared vision and mission. Watch out competitors! And customers – you’re going to get an even better service!
Have I ever gone to such extremes just to see a band I love? Not exactly. But I would if the opportunity presented itself again. We're staying at my aunt and uncle's house in Bethesda, and we got relatively cheap airline tickets, so we're doing this whole thing as cheaply as possible. However, the whole endeavor is costing some cash. Which got me thinking at about 4:30am this morning: How many performances HAVE I attended in my long, long life? And if I had ever dollar I'd spent on those tickets sitting in front of me, what could I buy? And who all HAVE I seen live? Who HAVEN'T I seen who I'd really like to see before I (or they) buy the farm?

This past Sunday was beautiful in Hendersonville, NC. We had just attended Grace Blue Ridge which is currently located in the Art Center building 538 North Main Street. We love being able to attend church on Main Street in downtown Hendersonville and have a wonderful lunch afterwards in one of the many restaurants found on Main Street. We decided to venture out to another part of town this time to have our Sunday dinner.
Hayley is also living with a single parent, but it is her mother who is absent having died of cancer, her father combining work and care. Like many of her friends she dreams of being famous without any clear idea of what she'd like to be famous for. In her struggles to keep up with the bragging of other girls in the school she begins an ill-advised relationship with a teacher, something which threatens to distract her from those upcoming exams. She also has the hots for Charlie who could be said to be the novel's linchpin. Charlie still has both his parents at home but his father is drunken and abusive to both wife and son and his mother is understandably a shell of her former self. Charlie is the classic example of a kid far cleverer than he realises but who doesn't have the right outlet for that intelligence He also articulates the hopelessness felt by many children growing up in a society where the usual standards of work and reward seem to be leap-frogged by others.

Mays began his professional career in 1947, when he played with the Chattanooga Choo-Choos during the summer while he was still in high school. After playing for the Choo-Choos for a short time he returned home to Alabama in order to play with the Birmingham Black Barons. The New York Giants signed Mays in May of 1950 and he made his Major League debut on May 25, 1951. He was only twenty years old.

Richard Youngs is a prolific and unpredictable musician whose work ranges from quirky folk and psychedelia to abstract improvisation and more, but my favorite of his many modes is the one he's in on Long White Cloud. This is Youngs in his ethereal folksinger guise, singing plaintive melodies over delicate, chiming guitar picking or repetitive piano. After the understated elegance of the simple, pretty first two tracks, Youngs then stretches out for the mantra-like "Big Waves of an Actual Sea," on which he intones a droning chant over simple piano chords for a few minutes until suddenly introducing additional layers, echoing and superimposing his voice as the piano motif grows more complex as well. This is followed by the ritualistic "Rotor-Manga-Papa-Maru," on which Youngs keeps returning to the nonsense chant of the title over a grinding, circular guitar motif and a processed, growelly vocal sample that provides the song's bass pulse. The final track, "Mountains Into Outer Space," restates and reconfigures the melody and lyrics of the opening song, and it's the album's best piece and one of Youngs' very best songs. For nearly nine minutes, a blipping, skipping guitar pattern propels Youngs' soaring voice into the stratosphere, dripping with ache and reverb. It's a haunting tune, and Long White Cloud as a whole is one of Youngs' best singer/songwriter albums, along with Autumn Response and Beyond the Valley of Ultrahits. [buy]

Rianne is a self-assured kid so we were a little surprised when Heath wanted to try out too. I don’t mean to be a mean mom but Heath is more like me lacking your typical talents that get displayed in a talent show, I thought what is he going to do? Argue, pretend to be a Spy? He decided he would do dribbling a basketball he can go between his legs and so he practiced. Rianne showed no fear in preforming at tryouts Heath on the other hand was very nervous and only dribbled a few times and afterwards blamed his nerves on something else like the fact that they called him Keith.

There is an epilogue to this story. A few months after this exhibition, I was called to Australia, where my mother was dying. In 2005, having bought a house here, I popped back to France to organize the move. Upon opening my shutters, the first thing that I saw was a young oak tree, recently planted on the other side of the road near the roundabout. I know that there had been no plans to replace the murdered oak before I read my text, so I conclude that I had some influence on it.

There are those who remember that back in February 2010, before the world realized just how broke Greece was, the public’s deplorably short attention span was briefly focused on none other than Goldman Sachs, which as so often happens, was at the heart of the scheme enabling Greece to skirt by Maastricht regulations and mask the fact that its debt and deficits were both far worse than represented publicly. There are also some who remember that back in February 2010, it was none other than the Federal Reserve that tasked itself with uncovering whether Goldman did anything “illegal” by engaging in currency swaps to make the Greek economy appear rosier than it was: “We are looking into a number of questions related to Goldman Sachs and other companies and their derivatives arrangements with Greece,” Bernanke said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee…. Greece in 2001 borrowed billions, with the aid of Goldman Sachs in a deal hidden from public view because it was treated as a currency trade rather than a loan….Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment on the Fed’s probe. “As a matter of policy we don’t comment on legal or regulatory matters,” DuVally said. Goldman Sachs had defended the transactions in a statement posted on its Website Sunday. The firm said they had a “minimal effect” on Greece’s overall fiscal situation.” Maybe, just maybe it is time, two years later, for the world to hear something, anything, from the Fed as to what its seemingly quite extensive investigation into Goldman’s has yielded.
In other non-television news this week has been a good one. Nothing too notable, just very busy and full of hot yoga which makes me immeasurably happy. And luckily this weekend will be full of family and some pool time. I'm looking forward to seeing the lot where my sister and her husband are building their new house too- I'm so excited for them! I'm going to try to remember to take my camera out and about all weekend so hopefully on Sunday I'll have some fun photos to share. So until then.

To me, the biggest con to this product line is the price tag. This isn’t specific to the Vega Sport line but applies to all of Vega’s products. Yes the ingredients are high quality, and I understand that high quality ingredients come with a higher price tag. But for me, the price isn’t something that would fit into my regular budget. If it fits into yours, all the more power to you. I think that some of these products (mainly the gel, the bars, and the protein powder) would be worth buying, if financially feasible.

To wait until a record is actually set, then say “we realize we don’t meet the standards, but the mark is so good can you allow it anyway” is just inexcusable – and just another example of how unprofessional this sport can be at times. And for the organizers to essentially say that the course has not yielded such fast times before, therefore it does not aid the runners is a ludicrous argument. For example, the Johannesburg track never yielded a sub 10.00 before Linford Christie ran 9.97 in ‘95 and then Obadele Thompson blazed 9.87 in ‘98. Yet the altitude was always there. Point being that conditions do not always yield exceptional results even though they exist. Exceptional results are a result of exceptional conditions being taken advantage of by exceptional athletes in the course of exceptional competition. One of the reasons why records are simply not an every day occurrence.
I remember this one. I remember liking it - mostly because it mentions Ellery Queen.

Clearly, Corbin knows her subject well and has brought together dozens that would otherwise take some research to unearth. Many show an experimental stamp on otherwise venerable recipes with plenty of riffs on basic ideas. With a solid discussion of what makes good preserves and how to stave off spoilage, it’s a book I’d recommend to beginners as well as advanced preservers. As Fearnley-Whittingstall puts it in the introduction, “…she will show you the ropes and then give you the reins.”
Overall, Eastern Promises felt like a practice run for A History of Violence. Many of the same themes are explored, but not with the depth seen in Violence. One thing in particular really bugged me about Eastern, and ended up impacting my feelings about the movie as a whole. At the end of Violence Cronenberg treats the audience to a view of the normal American family sitting down to dinner. Everything looks perfect, but if you’ve sat through the entire film, you know that this is just a veneer for the ugliness underneath. It’s a great moment, and one that he can’t recapture (or doesn’t choose to) in Eastern.

I stopped writing creatively for a long time until I moved out to San Francisco. Here, somehow, I have found myself drawn to writing more than anywhere else I’ve been—in the past two years since living in San Francisco, I have written three novels and am currently working on my fourth. Some of these novels were completed during the month of November, for National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), which I have to thank for helping me find my passion once again.
Witton Lakes are ironically not exactly in Witton but very close to the the district.

He came to our house within the first week or so we had arrived asking for money for one of the festivities. It was him doing the talk and explaining, with 4 or 5 more of his friends. I gave him some money and he made some comment about not being as much as our friend Mac down a couple of houses. But he was OK with it. The next day he shows up again asking for more money. By the third visit I said he’d have to wait a little longer before coming back. Our conversations were getting a little expensive.

When the start of the session was announced, I rattled off five or six lines and asked the room if I was bothering anyone. Short pause. Then, everyone agreed that they all liked the sound, particularly the bell at the end of the line and the zip of the returning carriage. There was definitely something appropriate about being in a coffee house with someone clicking away on a typewriter.
In the aftermath, it was Daniel who first told The Australian of local kids’ suspicions about the bin Laden compound, known as the graveyard of sports balls thanks to the strict “no retrieve” policy imposed by the secretive neighbours.

Here’s a rockin’ remake of the timeless ‘60s hit The Letter, perfect for the pop portion of your concert. “Give me a ticket for an airplane. Ain’t got time to take no fast train.” This arrangement has a kickin’ groove!

Hi Everyone! This week for our Frosted Designs Show Me Sunday tutorial I would like to share a quick, easy, and cute home decor project that you can make using lots of things that you most likely already have laying around in your stash. It probably only cost me about $10 to make this. Here are the materials that you will need:
Step 1: Soak the lotus seeds in water in a big bowl for a few hours.

I hope you are as blessed by Psalm 23 by Trevor Morgan as I have been listening to it in my car this week.
So, I ask my son, Aniruddh, and he says, “Dad, what made you cook Indian is what will…..” but I cut him short because I know he thinks that what made me cook Indian food is what will make a young chef do so.

We have some amazing birds around here... quail, roadrunners, hummingbirds, and cardinals, to name a few. The other day a most brilliant red cardinal decided to dine at the block... bird block that it. I grabbed my camera and carefully parted the curtains for this pic (zoomed in to really get a better picture).
Peterson said, “Everyone will have to answer for themselves, and I felt comfortable in offering this resolution, knowing that I was doing what was right on behalf of Louisiana citizens that deserves a place at the table.”
So, let’s do the math: EUR: not a reserve currency? Check. CHF: not a reserve currency? Check (and pegged to the former). USD: about to be gang banged by the windowless corner office at the Marriner Eccles building housing America’s central planners? Check. So…. what is left if one is looking for a reserve currency?

Day 3: Same as Day 2 but add some fish or chicken to one meal.
Having noted the New Testament’s unique application of divine sonship, in Ps. 2 the divine begetting of the anointed one did not happen at conception or birth, and there is no indication that the anointed one was to be considered half human, half deity. Just as was the case in the ancient Mediterranean world, the moment of divine “begetting” happened specifically at the King’s coronation. In the New Testament, and especially for Paul, Jesus was begotten by God, not only in terms of his physical birth, but more so when he was raised from the dead,

The thing that really kills us is that he seems fine. He wrestles with Vizzini. He chirps at us and runs for his food, which he continues to gobble down. He is a major purr-meister, as always.
Perhaps I am being unfair in assuming that only horny teens in the U.K. are guilty of this. In one instance, the blog was even graced by a Canadian woman. Well, based on the question asked, I'm assuming that it was a woman...

We will continue to grow and increase, welded harmoniously, dedicated and sacred in the presence of the Lord. In Jesus and in fellowship with others we are being built up to form a home of God through the Holy Spirit and we now can approach the Almighty.
One thing Mr. Paul likes to talk about is an independent audit of the gold reserves of the United States of America. Do you support this.

Fast paced, horn driven, bass loaded, that is the introducing Compared To That. Bromberg excels on Upright bass with impressive dexterity. Jeff Lorber brings with his signature piano virtuosity the piece to breathtaking highs.
Step 2: Measure all parts covered in fabric and estimate how much fabric you need. Add extra fabric for seam allowances, or in other words, staple allowances. No sewing required. :) I used about 5 yards of very wide upholstery fabric.
My instinctive reaction is to obey his orders, and for a few moments, I stumble after him, weaving my way through the noisy market crowd. Then I stop, because I remember I am not a slave-girl any more because my Master and Mistress are dead, and the only person I will ever follow is not here, perhaps even dead like his parents before him.
I like days off from school. I like it that my boys had a Monday in February off from school for President's day. Thank you Presidents for being born.

She brings me a small plastic shopping basket being "pulled" by a Barbie horse harnessed in yarn. She has found some flattened boxes in our recycling to use for the wheels. We cut off thick strips and wrap them around a drinking glass to make them the same size. Then we glue the edges. A problem, though, is the axle. We have chopsticks for the axle. But what about the spokes to attach the wheels to the axle?
In the 21,600 breaths I take every day, my heart steadily beats a 100,800 lub-dub’s. Between every in and out and every lub-dub, I have a choice to cleanse myself of built up debris and pent up emotions and from that muck grow lotuses that stand tall, radiantly proud and glistening with moist love.

J: To increase the awareness. There are still some people on the planet who don’t even know who Jesus is. They’ve never even heard the name. What we as Christians must do is tell them about who Jesus is and what he did for the human race. We cannot, and shouldn’t, try to or otherwise attempt to force our belief’s down somebody’s throat. We can tell them of their situation and of what they can do to become Christian and also relate how we became believers as well. But from there the decision to become a follower of Christ is their decision and theirs alone.
I have them a LOT.
This is an entirely mediocre collection, though Snyder does show some promise as a writer if she works on her narrative skills.

This potential fraud has a happy ending, exemplifying one of the ways RECO fulfills its mission to uphold the integrity of real estate transactions. While RECO’s efforts prevented the fraudsters from making off with over half a million dollars, they remain at large. York Regional Police continue to investigate.

Now mine is a total re-cycle, lol, i took a gift box that looks like a milk carton, recieved some choccies in it over Xmas, painted a few layers of Gesso over the whole box to cover the original printing. then took a black ink pad and dabbed spots all over and before it was dry, took a piece of cottonwool and whiped over that in soft stoke movements. On the one side i added my image , slightly colored with some added gems and then another re-cycled item added, i punched some flowers from the lid of a coffee tin and added a gem as centre piece, lovely flower, don't ya think .....:))the other sides were decorated with some scraps, gems and some more punched tin lids, lol , please excuse any spelling mistakes, this head of mine is really fuzzy, lol
We did indeed hear ESPN Radio on the new "ESPN 96.7", known to the FCC as WLLF/96.7 Mercer PA, just over the Ohio border from Youngstown and Warren.
Yet in many ways, Friedan still advocated for working women. She tried to push feminists to focus on economic issues such as economic equality and government provisions for daycare. Both of these actions would greatly help working women, even in 2012. I believe that learning more about Betty Friedan’s past, as well as the history of the early Cold War, would help many feminists to understand the roots of modern feminism, and why it took what some consider a more conservative turn in the 1960s.
The Lords is supposed to be the check on Commons excesses, yet the Commons has the means, in the Parliament Acts and others, to utterly ignore the wishes of the Lords, and ride roughshod over any amendments they might make to legislation, no matter how beneficial those amendments might be, as we’ve seen demonstrated so ruthlessly of late.

But recently, just a few doors down from where Veli’s originally stood, another all-new family-owned restaurant that serves only breakfast and lunch opened up. It’s called Stacked and once I heard about it, I couldn’t wait to see how it would compare to my memories of Veli’s.
Hurt and confused I gave up.
“My goal is to get men and especially men of color to realize that worship is not a feminine sport,” Hurd says. “In this season, I feel we should come together and lift up a sound that has the power to change families and strengthen communities and help brothers to get a glimpse of what real worship is. I think when men see other men worship it gives them freedom to worship without feeling emasculated.” Throughout the broadcast, Hurd is seen leading the congregation in song and sharing the stage with his musical peers such as Jason Nelson, Deonte Gary, Anthony Brown and Anthony Evans who was recently featured on the NBC televised singing competition, “The Voice.” This idea that worship has become feminized and uncomfortable for men is not anything new. This conversation have been taking place for a couple of years now. But this is the first time I've seen it address by a man of color.
Anyone familiar with the story already knows all the details and "facts" as reported by the drive-by, race-baiting media. I won't bore you with those.

Mom and Dad came to cheer us on and help Kurt with the babies. We had such a great weekend! Although I am happy the race is over I wish everyone didn't have to leave already! Here are a few highlights from the weekend: Phillipi's, shopping, matching shirts for the race, Lexi and Jules playing together in the crib, Jules playing peekaboo with Lexi, lounging around the beach house, the Race, taking silly sister photos after the race, Robertos tacos, Seaport Village, laughing with my sis, Grandma and Grandpa spending quality time with grand babies, Kurt catering to my every need because of my exhaustion after the race, Las Olas, going to church with my fam, people thinking Alyssa was me at church, Valentine exchanges, getting roses from Kurt, seeing the Townsends, eating lunch at the park by the beach, Alyssa forgetting her iPod and Dad coming to the rescue, Dad finding us at mile 9 to brighten our spirits, running with Alyssa, beautiful weather. Looking forward to having the whole Heap Clan together (except for Brad) in three weeks for Spring Break!

When we finally cut into the tart for dessert, I realized that the melted (hardened) chocolate made it very difficult to cut into - both with the knife, and when eating it with a fork. So although I loved the taste of the chocolate in the tart, next time I'll probably leave it out.

Springtime is definately here in Wellington. All sorts of trees introduced from the Northern Hemisphere are starting to show their glorious blossoms and blooms, and the fruit trees are so welcome.

The list of victims goes on. There's Gillie Christou, who was Maria 'is that a bruise no its chocolate' Ward's supervisor. There's Clive Preece, Head of Safeguarding at Haringey. Both have also been sacked, purely because they made the decision to send Peter back to his mother, rather than placing him with a foster family. Anyone can make a mistake, right? Both are appealing, of course.
The word itself in Dutch means “attorney” or “lawyer” but there’s no obvious connection to the legal profession at all. It is also so similar to adpokat, an Indonesian word for avocado, that two rival modern explanations for this egg-and-liquor concoction’s name have arisen.

3. Jem and the Holograms- Now this was one of my favorites and I clearly remember on my first day of Kindergarten we were asked to sing the theme song from our favourite show. I belted out “Jem… Jem is truly outrageous. Truly, truly, truly outrageous Woo ooo Jem… Jem the music’s contagious.” I even remember getting Jem blue and pink eye shadow and loading it on my eyes.

The writing world is full of people who practice their craft outside of the hours of 9 to 5. Many of us slave away at day jobs – some fulfilling others simply filling the bank account – and those that aren’t in the office spend their hours looking after their children, only able to sneak in a few writing sessions during nap time. If you were to ask this secret society of writers what they do, 99.9 percent would answer with what they do during the 40-hour workweek (except the moms, that job is more than full-time and should be honored as so).

This project will explore a variety of ways to encourage and enable people with disabilities who are at least part time (“conditionally”) eligible for ADA paratransit to increase their use of the fixed route public transit bus and/or train service. Major areas of study will include improving the accessibility of bus and train systems, including the streets and sidewalks used to reach bus stops and train stations; providing optional travel training; providing fare incentive programs; marketing the benefits of bus and train services to the disability community; and exploring improved methods of paratransit eligibility determination.

As I think about the stories I tell my students, I realize that many of them involve gender issues. So often my students, especially the 18-20 year olds, come to my classes believing that inequality between the sexes is a thing of the past, something their mothers and grandmothers had to contend with once upon a time. So I tell them my stories, and see if they think that's still true.
SM: I attended SCBWI (a conference specifically for children's book authors and illustrators) in NYC this past January. I enjoyed the show very much and learned quite a lot. I'm not the most outgoing person in the world so I probably didn't meet as many people as I could have but I did wind up making some good contacts, both other writers and people in the business.

As you know, Katie got her amazing voice from her mom. When Jill was ten years old, she was asked to sing O Holy Night for the Christmas Eve service at her church. Just like Katie, she had a spectacular voice for someone so young, and she brought the congregation to their knees with her emotionally stirring performance. After that first time, it became an annual tradition, repeated every year for the rest of her life.
HI Everyone! So while I was just taking a break from writing my horribly long exam review, I was thinking to myself how I am kind of impressed with how fast I have been typing my notes as I read my text book-- and with relatively few errors! It made me want to find a Words Per Minute test online to see what my actual WPM count is and how accurate I am. Well it only took about 2 seconds to find this easy WPM test!

One may wonder why we bothered giving such a damnable thing as the Curse a name, which could only serve to give it life and form, solidifying its existence. The running theory is that by separating the Curse from ourselves, it turns the enemy from an intangible into a tangible form. It gives it substance, and what has substance can be defeated.
On Wednesday, Rylie had her school Seder for Passover. All of the students in the school brought a parent or other adult. It was the first time I met Jake's Dad. Jake ran over to Rylie to hug her at which point his dad said, "So YOU are Rylie. We hear a lot about you at home." Apparently according to Jake's Dad, the feeling is mutual and Rylie gets just as much airtime in Jake's house as he gets in our house. :-)

I’d suck his dick just to feel numb. Just to regress further within myself. Until he broke it. Broke the fake me one day and I couldn’t pretend anymore. I was numb; I could not speak. So there he left me, and some slice of me came back,
But this was a different level. This involved my heart. Something I always put out there, but had a large protective barrier around it. And……it was now permanently meshed with my sons. It wasn’t just me to think about. This would involve some time. In this case the time was about 6 months.

As Bull mentioned last month, I recently left Kansas City to take a job at Dogfish Head. I've been trying to find the time to put together a blog post about the move but it's been a little hectic. I decided to sit down this weekend and finally compose something. I figured most people won't care much about my move or the work I'm doing but they'd want to hear more about the brewery, so I put together a list of tips for anyone who might want to make the trip out to Milton or Rehoboth. I had always wanted to make the trip to Milton before taking this job with Dogfish, but it didn't seem feasible from KC and I knew next to nothing about the area. Hopefully this will help convince a few of you that it's not as much trouble as it seems and it's definitely worth it.

Gov. Scott Walker's campaign announced today he raised more than $13 million during the most recent reporting period pushing his overall haul to fend off a recall attempt at $25 million. Walker's campaign said in a release he finished the pre-primary period, which covers through April 23, with $4.8 million in recall and general campaign funds....Barrett's campaign announced Friday he raised $750,000 in a little more than three weeks after getting into the race March 30. Falk's campaign said she raised $1 million between mid-January and April 23.After next Tuesday, Walker will spend all that money attempting to crush his opponent. We've seen all the attacks on Scott Walker for the past year, but what we haven't seen is the sudden, intense barrage of negativity against whoever it is that wins the primary.

Bin Laden’s death does not bring justice to those who lost loved ones because of his actions; it does not end a war; it does not do the will of God. I can rejoice in the end of his leadership but in his death, I cannot. I will not. This is a time to mourn how justice was not served to 9/11 victims and to him. As I type this I can feel the anger that some people will have with these words and I can feel the hate that some will have for me because I am saying them. This is why it needs to be said. Bin Laden was a man, a human, a child of God. It is a tragedy that we killed him instead of trying to redeem him. It is by loving those that the world and ourselves deem “unlovable” that we follow in the footsteps of Christ.

I walked out of there with a grin on my face and one very bewildered parts supply agent. The rest of the guys in there were cool to deal with me but then of course, they were younger. I usually get the "Does not compute looks from the older generation of guys and some of the more macho young ones". The women....well... they just keep smiling and seem to be more approachable than ever I had noted when I presented strictly as run of the mill male.

Watching a new Indiana state administration (Mitch Daniels) and a returning national administration (George W. Bush) already has me looking ahead to 2008. Some early predictions:
This was so fast, and it's all so simple and delicious... and it was pretty cheap too. A $2 package of chicken thighs from whole foods (our meat csa membership has lapsed... not sure how we feel about it), $5 worth of baby spinach, $1.25 worth of cous cous, and there's enough for two dinners tonight and a lunch tomorrow. It was easy to make it all simultaneously too, I'll put a chronology at the end of the post.
Researchers say if a person’s biological clock (circadian rhythms) or sleep cycles are disturbed, the body doesn’t function as well – as well as the brain’s thinking ability declines – to the point of being possibly dangerous in complex situations.
Yet the members of the bipartisan committee that’s supposed to come up with a bill are still reportedly far apart. The big sticking point is how to pay for the extensions — in other words, what budget changes should be made to offset the costs.
2.) “Lights Down”
This is a very high-traffic road with no shoulder and morning school traffic is no place to be assing around. Also, I was driving my mom's car and the driver's window doesn't roll up and down, only down. I was very disappointed to know I had to drive away from Squirrely, undocumented. As I drove away I hoped he would still be there when I came back 10 hours later, but I wasn't going to hold my breath.
My day would have been survivable if my kids would have happily sat in front of the T.V. all day, but no, no that cannot happen on a day like that day. They fought with each other all.day.long! I could hardly do a thing about it because I could hardly move or sit up with out feeling weak and like I was going to pass out. I was miserable to say the least!

I made a little card to wrap my twine around out of a cereal box. You really do need something to wrap around as you go, or the paper has trouble holding together. I think this would be great to wrap around a gift instead of ribbon, and is a nice way to re-use an item many of us read through once and then get rid of (though truth be told, I'm horrible about keeping magazines around forever).
Then Chidziva told Vambe to throw the spear at one of their own people called Nyakuvambwa. Vambe threw the spear at Nyakuvambwa and the spear bent but Nyakuvambwa was not wounded. When Nyemba imwe inozvimbira chita chese saw that, he stood up and went to Chidziva and shook his hand saying, Thank you very much for I have seen that you know how to fight and you are strong men. You are my friends, come with me to my home.” Chidziva and his people entered the chief’s village. The chief of the vaRozvi told his people to kill cattle for Chidziva and his people. They stayed at the chief’s village for many days. When Chidziva and his people were returning to their home they gave the chief of the vaRozvi hoes, and axes which they had brought from their home.

Soooo hard core hahaha. I was the spy. I crept downstairs and hid around the corner from the family room and texted Benjamin from the basement to clue them in on what was happening. The boys were in charge of making the noise :) It started off small. Someone walking across the floor.. then it got louder--tables/furniture being shifted, louder stomps on the floor, running water, etc. By the end those girls were severely terrified. I felt SOOOO horrible because I would have been peeing my pants had I been in their shoes!

Pocket (cover which must be stuffed with an absorbent layer) and All In One (absorbent layers and cover are sewn together) diapers are marketed to keep baby from feeling wetness to allow for a greater length of wearing time, similar to a disposable, but that is not our diapering style. For reference, most one size pocket and AIO diapers don't really fit well until the 9-10 pound mark and it can be nearly impossible to find one style/brand that will fit the variety of baby sizes in your family (ie. we had a pre-term 5 pounder, a football player 8 pound term boy, and a really scrawny 8 pound term boy).
The only thing I wasn’t completely comfortable with was tanking, but this is where I have to give a shoutout to the awesome people of Ephemera who encouraged me to try and gave me ample opportunity to practice. They were persistent and non-judgemental, and I love them for it.

Second. I noticed that I slump a lot when I write. So I did some research and found that exercise balls are great for your back while sitting at a desk, and they make wonderful computer chairs. I got one and love it. It's helped my back, and I find it useful to stretch out on after long hours of writing. You can also do sit ups on them, which is a lot easier for me than doing them on the hard ground.

I have no chance of seeing Mrs Siddons. She did act on Monday but as Henry was told by the Boxkeeper that he did not think she would all the places and all the thought of it were given up. I should particularly have liked seeing her in Constance and could swear at her with little effort for disappointing me.
I knew she was working on English. I assumed her distress had something to do with one of the scary, irregular verbs both her and her teachers are always stumbling over. I was elbow deep in dinner preparations, and frankly not in the mood to be very helpful. I sighed impatiently, "For heaven's sake Emma. Just sound it out. One letter at a time. You'll get to it."

In the same attack Altemeyer also says that I think that Milgram's experiments used students as subjects and Psychology Department faculty as authority figures. I said no such thing. I said that the "tradition of research" emanating from Milgram's work was so characterized. In other words, Milgram's successors tend to be less rigorous than Milgram. Altemeyer's attempts to denigrate my work are then quite shallow. It is hard, therefore, to avoid the impression that Altemeyer was simply looking for anything which might justify his failure to consider ideas other than his own.

Though the weekend weather started out pleasant enough, it soon deteriorated into some icy, windy and sleety weather. Just in time for my warm-weather loving brother and his family. It was nice to get together again and see the cousins play together. It brought back memories of that connection cousins share.
This morning though, I was very grateful for the day off. For the chance to sleep in, laze around in my pajamas all day long and catch up on my to-do list.

Firstly, it is extremely unlikely that this is the first time that this individual was involved in acts of that kind. Grown people do not just change their behaviour in a few months’ time, we all know that. My point being that this episode calls into question the screening which is carried out in relation to these appointments. Whatever screening processes now exist, will definitely have to be made stronger, together with ongoing reviews of Board performance.

For me 2011 was all about settling into a new life in a new city with a new job surrounded by new people. It also included getting (geographically) closer to family and dear friends from my past. It's been a busy year full of exploring, meeting new friends, and making a home in Portland. I'm excited to spend the next year having fun! I have a mental list of little goals for 2012 and I'll probably try to write them down at some point today, but my umbrella hope for the new year is to continue to have fun doing what I do.

The country is bankrupt, taxes have gone up, moan about it and keep on drinking. Just spare me any crap about pubs going bust, being kicked in the teeth, and pubs being the centre of the community. I expect my cheap lout to remain cheap, maybe not as cheap, but still cheap. That is what matters.
Most of the time we’re just off in our own little world innocently trying to get in and out of a store as quickly as possible when suddenly we’ll hear gross slurping noises behind us. When we turn around to investigate the source of vulgarity, we’ll catch some dude not-so-slyly checking us out whilst his desperate girlfriend is trying to give him huge hickeys anyplace she can land them.
I still wish to give back. Maybe the whole idea behind Spotlights is sound but rough, misdirected. Maybe switching to smaller scale, less frequent posts is the answer. I don’t know. I’ll have to think about it, but for now I’ll go back to the previous model.

Le Journal d’Aurélie Laflamme is an eight-book series that has caused a furor of Twilight-esque proportions among preteen girls in Quebec, sparking a movie and a spate of reviewers gushing about its “authenticity” and “fresh humour”. Aurélie is a fourteen-year-old girl growing up with her widowed mother in what I presume to be Montreal (they mention the Biodome). In the first volume, titled Extraterrestre…ou presque!, she writes about her boy-crazy best friend Kat, her crush on a dude she meets in an arcade, her suspicion that her mom is dating her principal, her longing for a pet kitten, her anxiety over the fact that the only person she’s kissed is a poster of Daniel Radcliffe – all pretty standard preteen fare. (Since the whole series seems to be tinged with a gentle bubblegum pink, I’m mildly curious as to whether by Book 8, Aurélie is doing drugs and having sex, as a 17-year-old on the verge of entering Cegep.)

Thus it appears that the chasuble, beginning as the ordinary outer garment of the poor, was retained by the clergy when other people changed the fashion of their clothes, and thus became their ministerial dress. But down to the end of the thirteenth century the idea of its being a sacrificial garment had not arisen. Its accepted meaning was charity. But in the thirteenth century Innocent III. and the Fourth Lateran Council introduced such wide reaching modifications of the Christian faith as almost to change its character. In 1215 Transubstantiation became the authorised belief, and auricular confession the authorised practice of the Latin Church. Transubstantiation, which is the basis of the Sacrifice of the Mass, and compulsory confession profoundly altered the conception entertained of the priesthood. The presbyter now became a sacrificing priest, and the victim that he sacrificed was no other than Christ Himself, while in the confessional he sat as the representative of God. His vesture must indicate the stupendous office which he held. The most noticeable, because the outside, garment that he wore was the chasuble; the chasuble therefore must symbolise sacrifice. By degrees it attracted to itself this character, and in the course of the subsequent centuries it became recognised as the priestly sacrificial vestment, while it underwent considerable changes in form.

Ok. That did it. Her eyes widened... in horror? And her mouth dropped open. Crap. How to salvage this... "It's so good to see you all." And I hugged her. Yes, yes I did. Her mouth finally closed, and I turned to sign the credit slip. When I turned back, D's husband had exited the bathroom, and she bolted with him, without even saying a word to me. Time to cut my losses. I finished my transaction, said a quick goodbye, and we casually headed out to the car.

When "The Bang Bang Club" was released on circuit, it was rated 16 for Language and Violence by the Film and Publications Board. Yet when SABC 3 aired it on Saturday night, that rating had been increased to 18, for Language, Violence, Nudity, Sex and Prejudice. Moreover, the age rating and warning signals remained in place far longer than the required 60 seconds at the start and 30 seconds after each advertising break. According to the SABC's Editorial Polices, that indicates that the film contains "extremely controversial material".

Again, not actually that much… An order of magnitude or two more than it receives from the sun, I’ll believe (the area Io exposes to the sun – pi times the square of it’s radius – is 0.08184 of that of the Earth, and Io is a lot further from the sun). To continue on that vein, 10^14 Watts over a mere 24 hours comes in at 8.64×10^18 Joules. The radiation gained by the Earth from the sun in the same period mentioned above appears to be around 1.5×10^22 Joules. Io, therefore, presents .05% of the area to the sun and gets 4% of the radiation for a given area, for about .002% of the energy as a total. That comes out as 3×10^17 Joules of energy from the sun per day (ignoring Jupiter’s shadow etc), or about an order of magnitude or so less than the amount outputted by the Jovian Moon in a day. Whew… Anyway, where were we?

I just love those phrases. Who got paid to think them up? I myself am often looking for a “snacking occasion,” but I don’t think I’m the customer Kellogg’s is looking for. My idea of a good snack hasn’t been a can of Pringles – which Kellogg’s is buying from Proctor & Gamble – in a very long time.
I will never speak the truth. I will never write the truth.
For example, I have an idea to make an app for the Texas State Writing Center. I’m still in the conceptual stage at this time because there is a lot of prewriting I have to do. I have to design all of the screens and what the content of each screen will entail.
So there are a lot of aspects that go into our attempt to "love what we do". Some of them are under our control and some are not. All of us lose sleep over what we do and lay awake at night worrying about our jobs and the projects we are working on (at least I do, and I assume everyone else does too). And in my experience, people spend more time agonizing over and lose more sleep over the parts of the project that are out of their control than the parts they do control.
If you find yourself drawn to weird names, I challenge you to consider instead giving your character a weird or funky or long-story nickname instead. Because you plucky YA heroine is going to be an unemployable adult if she's genuinely named Shimmer. Just sayin'.

In the days of apartheid, "Boer" referred to Afrikaners in general, as well as the state at their disposal. The "Boer" of today is a farmer in the originally intended meaning of the Afrikaner word. He is disarmed in a state in which he is a grudgingly tolerated minority.

Once a month, she fills her sledge with the blankets she has woven. Then she harnesses up her winged reindeer and flies off to the edge of her world, where she hangs her blankets from a long line of air. She fixes them on with sharp hooks made from the broken-off points of stars. There they flap and float in the wind, and sometimes, if the season is right, we can look up into the sky and see them glittering on the horizon. We on Earth call them the Northern Lights.
She realized it would take years before she might be able to compete.
Okay, how many of you former Girl Scouts out there read that title and kept on humming the rest of the song? 'Simple Gifts' is actually an old Shaker dance song (they danced?), but I learned it as a wee Brownie back in my scouting days. I hadn't thought much on it, until the other night when my husband and I were out berry picking. I guess there's just something about walking around in bushes up to your shoulders while scavenging for little red treasures (read: thimbleberries) to make one mull over the beauty of a simplistic lifestyle.

At this point in my life, I have enough experience with Death to know I've evolved not so far from the girl who was joyous for peace. I've now become joyous to know this hard-to-understand grownup in my crazy childhood found his very own peace through his death. For that understanding, for that Gift to Me, I will be forever indebted to his experience. Painful & confusing as it was for me as a child.

Living with things I find beautiful, that have history, and tell our story make me feel grounded, centered and at ease. It brings peace, calm and comfort to my mind. In the last year I have had 5 addresses. We sold our home, we have lived in a furnished rental, as a nomad between our families in Knoxville and Detroit, and now again we're camping bare-bones in NYC. Most recently, we've recently committed again to life on the East Coast. We purchased a home in the hills of Connecticut. For that, I could not feel more blessed. This is an opportunity for us to feel stable once again, a place to call home. I will never take the feeling of being settled for granted again.

I started running down the beach, aware that so often on long journeys, the way feels more difficult at first. I’m not a runner by trade and so it always feels a bit like teaching a hippo to dance or something. I start moving and I always say the same thing: “this isn’t going to happen today.” I short-circuit my possibilities because running just feels hard. But here on the beach, with waves crashing on the left and soft sand and seaweed on the right, it felt especially difficult.
Well, since I've been pretty much embroiled in editing up till now, the two have pretty much been synonymous. I have spent a lot of time trying to build my online platform, but my brain is starting to itch for a new story. I am a pretty fast writer, so I'm not too worried about running out of time. Once I dive headfirst into writing, though, I don't do much else. So there will probably be at least one month this year in which I disappear from Twitter and Facebook, then reemerge later like some kind of troglodyte, manuscript in hand. I won't even think about ORIGIN during that time unless it's absolutely necessary.

Why are we as hosts, brides, and grooms many times so over-worked and over-spent when it comes to parties and weddings? You don’t need to know how to bake a pie, make custom decorations, cater a party, hand-craft seasonal cocktails, or arrange flowers. You just need to know how to ask for help. And if you know how to do all these things and don’t have the time or the money? You still need to know how to ask for help.

Typically, we think of central banks controlling inflation with the interest rate, which is the price you will be paid to delay consumption if you are holding assets. If you are holding money, however, rather than being paid, you must pay the inflation rate to delay consumption.
A determined player can still break the story: Phelps can run to every crime scene, drive along sidewalks and injure pedestrians, or accuse everyone of lying without exception. Team Bondi doesn't stop me doing any of these absurd things, but they do stop me from shooting out tires on passing cars. It's a seemingly random exception. Perhaps preventing players from drawing their gun is just easy; maybe Team Bondi would also prevent these other story breaking activities if it were more practical.

Sarah McCoy has written and expansive, multi-generational family history that is intricately complex. The result is a deep and satisfying story that involves a clever strategy of interconnected lives. Many parallels between characters over time and place become apparent. The reader is pulled across the decades with this writer’s clever craft as you follow Elsie at age seventeen in 1944, to Elsie’s life in Texas at seventy-nine. Family secrets, courage, love and forgiveness are themes that resonate throughout this richly well written novel with boundless depth that will pull the reader forward.

Far scarier than any of my ideas is the fact that at the age of seventeen, I was probably operating at my intellectual peak. I should have been tested then, before I squandered what little sense I had. By the time I reached my thirties, my brain had been strip-mined by a combination of drugs, alcohol, and the chemical solvents used at the refinishing company where I worked. Still, there were moments when, against all reason, I thought I might be a genius. These moments were provoked not by any accomplishment but by cocaine and crystal methamphetamine — drugs that allow you to lean over a mirror with a straw up your nose, suck up an entire week’s paycheck, and think, “God, I’m smart.”

In Betrayal(1978) Pinter succeeded in using the flashback technique, which he had begun to experiment with in “Old Times”, to scrutinise the mind's conscious and unconscious betrayals of reality. The play deals with the developing relationship between three people: Robert and Jerry have been close friends since their schooldays and Emma, wife of Robert and former mistress of Jerry. Pinter tells the story in a series of scenes moving backwards in time: there are nine scenes beginning in 1977 with meetings between Emma and Jerry and Jerry and Robert – two years after the adultery ended. We are taken back to a moment in the married couples bedroom in 1968, when the affair began. We are shown key episodes enacted after we have heard them discussed. With this technique for the first time in his work Pinter verifies the past. But does it accord with memories and conversations we see the characters have. We learn that there is a lot of deliberate deception which makes a dramatic event that is entwined with tricks of memory that the mind has no control over. They deliberately miss-remember and also involuntarily get the past wrong.

This verse is often interpreted in reference to the gratuity of grace; thus St Augustine comments: For that grace of the water that gushed from the rock (“now that rock was Christ ” 1 Cor 10:4), was not given on the score of works that had gone before, but of His mercy “that justifieth the ungodly.”(Rom 4:5) For “Christ died for sinners,”(Rom 5:6) that men might not seek any glory of their own, but in the Lord’s Name.

Also, be sure to get the piping that isn't split.

Having an allotment is not just about growing vegetables and fruit. It is a place to go when you need a break, It is a haven from city life. It is a hobby like no other. It is a garden for those without. It is a place to bring the kids at the weekend, or to sit down with a flask of tea and simply enjoy the view. Some people have them simply for one crop, some people only grow fruit, some people don’t grow food at all and just use their plots for growing flowers.
While it's easy to see they're no match, I'm curious to know which of the two you like better. Bellsprout is without doubt my favourite, it goes much better with my skin tone than L8R G8R - but if you go for the most linear holo, L8R G8R is the winner. As for now I'll stick with Bellsprout, but maybe when (if!) I get a little colour on my skin this Summer, I'll try L8R G8R again.

Listening to it reminded me of a poem i wrote a long while back,
Just because financially I can stay at home with my baby....doesn't mean I necessarily will full time....who knows how and what situation my family will be in 6 months from now, plus the 3 month maternity leave is actually 9 months:) Oh and Mr. Big Dog gets paternity leave too, so if we overlap who knows how long till I really would have to address this. Plus NOTHING is permanent:) My point is this stress if for nothing because no decision needs to be made right this second:)

I know a lot about them because they almost hired me as a writer. I went about 2-3 rounds with them. First, they read my writing sample and liked it, then they interviewed me, and then they had me write a company-specific sample. Eventually, they passed on me. And – really – I was okay with it. The company is located in San Diego and it would have been a b*tch of a commute. I mention all this because before I applied for the job, I had no idea who Joseph Kony, Jason Russell, or Invisible Children were. No idea. I don’t get the job and about a month later that very company creates a video that goes so viral – they’re on every major news outlet in the United States. I mean, every, single, one. Strange.

Since the classes are intended for students and faculty of the University, they’re super cheap.

I will be able to make four classes a week…4 classes/week X 4 weeks/month X 4 months = 64 classes for $63. How can you beat that? CRAZY!!!

But none the less the idea of the killing of nature by those who are guiding our policy, as demonstrated in today's National Planning Policy Framework, can help us to explain our own sense of despair and rage, and to realise that what they lack is not evidence but spiritual or moral wisdom. We should not follow them down their bureaucratic roads to nowhere, but rather affirm our shared love for mother earth and reframe our politics so that we use the power of this love to sweep away the nonsense of costing and enclosing the earth.
The pain I mentioned in my hand last weekend somehow migrated to my right arm, and got so bad that I couldn't lift it without assistance from my other hand (or "chicken wing it" as my doctor called it. Love him). He gave me the good stuff (prescriptions strength anti-inflammatory and a lowish dose of painkillers) and hooked me up with a specialist. I also got my first non-dental x-ray, which was anti-climactic. I did think it was funny when they called me three days later to tell me my arm wasn't broken. Well, I knew that, but I'd hope if it was, you'd have gotten back to me sooner!

Eventually, I moved here, and was able to go there when I wanted. It isn't exactly in the back yard, but there were days I would be walking back from the market and I'd stop in for some sandwich-making material, which was often sold to me by an exuberant West Indian lady. Through the door to the left, one could see the baker going about his routine, with his wood-burning oven and wooden peels and cooling loaves stacked up. I once got a loaf fresh out of the oven, and it was so hot I had to keep switching it from hand to hand so as not to burn myself. (Unfortunately, it was summer; you kind of hope for things like that around this time of year.)

Yesterday I was at one of my good friend’s bridal showers and a few of the bridesmaids asked me how to lose 5 pounds in a week. The bridesmaids dresses we will be wearing on Saturday are very form fitting so any extra baggage will be completely obvious. That being said, 5 pounds more or under can make a pretty significant difference for someone weighing 125 pounds.

Somewhere in the heat of all the frustration and media stoked rage, the President weighed in. He informed us if he had a son he would look like Trayvon. He passed on the opportunity to call for cooler heads, or to denounce the hype and hyperbole of race baiters like King Louie Farrakhan who tweeted a not so veiled threat about retribution and some good old fashioned eye for an eye payback.

This book also has more than its share of plot twists, I would go so far as to say that this one is the most twisted of all the Demon Squad books. While previous books did have the twists, none of them were so caustic as these to Frank. After all the recent deaths in the previous two books, the author does continue the trend not in number but in terms of important personage. I was very much surprised by the turns of the plot as the author constantly kept on switching tracks and thereby made the ending that much more unpredictable. Characterization-wise this book is the most accomplished of all however it focuses solely on Frank. With these books Frank has always been the sole narrator, but with the last two books, the focus was widened on the side character cast however with this one the scope is again narrowed down to Frank. This kind of narrative while having its plus points also makes it a problem if the reader doesn’t connect with the story. However with Frank, the reader is always left stunned with the amount and importance of information revealed and this just makes the next book that much more enticing especially when Frank reunites with those that have wronged him.

The weekly shot of beauty actually comes from the 5k Angels Among Us run that I participated in on Saturday. This was my first real 5k and my second real race. On thanksgiving last year I ran in an 8k “Turkey Trot” along with my sister which was a blast! Anyway, Angels Among Us held their race on the West Campus of Duke University which was fitting for me to say the least. One of the reasons I chose Duke was for the amazing architecture and the beauty of the campus. I love being on campus and running through the campus was a great experience. As far as Duke architecture goes, I don’t believe there is any more iconic shot than that of Duke Chapel’s Tower as seen from the aptly named, Chapel Drive. The race took us on Chapel Drive around the two mile mark and I couldn’t resist digging my phone out of my pocket to snag a picture. So here it is, without further ado, the Weekly Shot of Beauty.

straightforward, and I was impressed by the user-friendly set-up Lulu operates.

Officers Keith Cintron and Christopher Poythress are the ones who pulled the triggers on the tasers that probably killed this man. But they were "just following orders", right? I mean, just following orders means you can kill people, right? The Nazis who killed Jews were okay, because they were just following orders. Funny how Neuremberg Trial mentality only applies to Nazi Pigs and not American Pigs.

I feel like there is no resolution. Her ashes are sitting on a bookshelf in my house. Shouldn't that be enough? Will I ever feel like she is truly gone?

From The National Post:
Charles De Wolf, 66, considers Japan his home. He has also translated Tales of Days Gone By: A Selection from Konjaku Monogatari-shu (2003) and Isle of Dreams (2010) by Kezio Hino. He was an educator gifted with a facility for acquiring languages. He speaks German, French, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Tagalog, Indonesian, Palauan, Greek, and Italian. In an interview with The Japan Times, he shared his discovery of and enthusiasm for Japanese literature. For him the appeal of Japanese literature was in "the subtlety with which the drama of human relations is described. I had tended to look to European and American literature for 'grand ideas.' I suppose I sometimes wanted an Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov-like character expounding in Japanese, but that's not, on the whole, what Japanese literature is about." His multilingual background has served him well in Mandarins, which was replete with linguistic references.

Oh, and we stopped at Reiman Gardens after we dropped Da off at school (poor guy-I will write an update soon). Emma and I had only planned to be there for a few minutes- enough time to check on the mama and da geese that live in the pond there. Last time we visited, we sat by the little pond and drew the geese. The mama was sitting on a nest of eggs, so we kinda want to keep an eye on them so we can see the babies soon after they hatch.
The stress decreased over time, but those constant little earthquakes were constant little reminders. (Some not so little.) My friends there are still living with them.
I tried to listen to Mr. Papandreou’s speech ( he spoke for more than an hour) out of simple curiosity. My conclusion is Mr. Papandreou lives in another country! He insisted that for two years he has been saving Greece from bankruptcy (!) without mentioning that his party and himself had actually led the country into bankruptcy during their 30 year rule; no self criticism, not the slightest hint of self reproach. If a foreigner was to listen to Mr. Papandreou’s words he would think Greece is Eldorado, the perfect country with the perfect system and the happiest citizens!
In between, we were very entertained by the collection of excellent all-name bands playing:

Staggering home, no doubt feeling the adverse effects of the wine and the yogurt, Alex suddenly realizes that he has misplaced his keys. Luckily, Nicole is waiting in the hall to help him out. Beckoning him to her apartment, Alex approaches her door as if he were in a trance (the jagged chunks of wood the covered all the passage ways inside her apartment created this cool vaginal effect). Once in the apartment, Nicole says, "I turn you on, don't I?" I'm not sure he had much time to answer, because before you know it, Nicole is unmooring her aforementioned tight black panties (I knew they'd be black and I knew they'd be tight) in a highly unique manner (she pulls them out through a slit in the side of her skirt) and preparing to plant herself on top of his probably erect penis.

The number rods can be paired with their corresponding wooden cards. An important step is to scatter the objects that are to be match. This means that the numbers rods would be laid out randomly on the rug rather than in an order that may allow the child to simply predict the next number. Scattering the rods requires the child to count each of the blue and red spaces to find the correct quantity and length to match its card.

TP made a few changes from the team that beat Wolves in similarly ugly circumstances 48 hours previously. Delap came in for Jermaine Pennant, who dropped to the bench with a hamstring niggle. Wilson Palacios replaced the injured Glenn Whelan. And Peter Crouch was given a well-earned rest as Kenwyne Jones was given his chance. Stoke started brightly, looking dangerous in wide positions with Delap and Shotton combining surprisingly effectively down the right (to the extent that both Villa’s left sided players picked up bookings) and the impressive Marc Wilson, as he did against Wolves, providing support for Matthew Etherington on the left.
In fact, at the height of the Cultural Revolution during Mao’s time, owning a dog was seen as bourgeois –in face of massive starvation (and it really was) at different times in Communist political fervor and history. This was long after my parents came to Canada. Disapproval of dogs in China during that time, must be viewed against a backdrop of anti-imperialist campaigns, torture and unlawful arrest of innocent people. Dog lives seemed quite pale when family members disappeared or were brainwashed against their will. However now, with China’s growing middle class, the number of dogs as pets, in China is on the rise again.
For this uprising to continue in an effective manner, organisation is needed. Random looting is not going to overcome police injustice. But until then, the language of the unheard will continue to be spoken.
During August 2002 I was also filing a small claims court counter suit with our yacht club. I’d refused to pay the fees they were charging as they’d told me they’d waive them if I’d just move my boat to where they wanted it to go. When I wouldn’t move my boat, they hit with me fees. My boat was long since out of the yacht club, but when I wouldn’t pay, they sued so I had to file the paperwork for that in August also. The yacht club owed me money from a debenture, but they weren’t willing to apply what I owed against what they owed as the debenture wasn’t paybable as yet. Too many fires all at once.

Beer distributors now exercise enormous control, particularly with regard to smaller brewers. Since breweries can't sell directly to retailers, they have to negotiate with these intermediaries, the distributors. Problem is, the distributors have no particular loyalty to a brewery--so long as they can sell a truckful of beer, good enough. They don't care what's selling at the grocery store or pub, so long as it's one of their beers. The selling is for retailers. Therefore, if a retailer shifts an order, say upping its Full Sail order and dropping down its Deschutes, the distributor doesn't really care, so long as he has both breweries under contract. The bigger breweries with bigger volumes therefore appeal to distributors the most--because they know their retail accounts will reliably buy their beer.
I did eventually calm down. Cried myself out. The PA, Jason, that was going to perform the puncture consented to allow Jimmy to stay in the room. They suited him up with a lead apron and a sterile mask and he got to sit at my head and stroke my hair and do everything in his power to keep me calm.
I want to do something brave. I want to do something more. What that is, I don’t know. I guess I just have to do, do, and do. Let life take me wherever I should be. I can never know where I should go, so I should just keep moving. Doing this is one step.
Welcome to this stop on The Last Girl Tour. It has been my pleasure to review this book and offer up my opinion. I've always had a thing for dark vampires, because the true be told they are predators. Even though they may or may not have the capicity for human emotion, it still leaves the majority of their very essence dripping on the animalistic side. You can check out the rest of the tour here: http://darkmindbooktours.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/now-scheduling-last-girl-tour.html Let's take a look at the book:

The second comedian was actually a comedienne, from Belgium...now I hate Belgium, for the simple reason that everytime we drive to England we spend a large portion of the journey in Belgium, and in my experience the autobahn there are the worst in Europe, it's like the civil engineers made the road surface out of corrugated cardboard, and then to add insult to injury you have to put up with the Belgian drivers. Living here in Germany I'm fairly used to driving on the autobahn where some parts have no speed restriction (Jeremy Clarkson, eat your heart out) and on those stretches you get Porsches and the like shooting up behind you from literally nowhere, but it's OK, you know to expect it and so you check your mirrors and move out of their way, fine, no problem. Belgium doesn't have unrestricted autobahn but you still get idiots who shoot up behind you, pretty much into the boot of your car and expect you to pull over immediately, even if there's no space in the inside lane...when you don't respond to their threat and crash your car into the Stobart wagon alongside they pull back and then race up to you again - fun. Anyway the most memorable thing about the comedienne (from Belgium) was that her day job is doing voice overs in different languages for porn films...
After ice cream, I casually mentioned that we needed to swing by Goodwill for the monthly midnight madness sale. You can imagine their enthusiasm upon hearing this. Good thing the ice cream was still fresh in their minds (and all over their faces). You see, I had a hidden agenda. I had been eying this tufted ottoman for about six weeks at the local Goodwill.

October is Spina Bifida Awareness Month, and we SB moms have on our minds, more than anything, the precious unborn babies who are so often terminated before they even have a chance to prove their lives have meaning and value to the world. To say that 50% of all Spina Bifida affected pregnancies are terminated is a conservative estimate. But we SB moms know there is no reason to terminate a baby because of SB. Our children are beautiful and intelligent gifts from God who have every opportunity to live full, productive, and totally normal yet extraordinary lives.

While you might find some of the stuff a little pricey, it would be important to note that firstly, a lot of these artists only sell during art fairs and exhibitions and secondly, most of the items that are sold are handmade and could also take a month or more to make. You can tell there’s a lot of effort put in, you’ll even catch the artists painting, crocheting or making jewellery at their stalls.
The ultimate patriots, the Pawikans (Filipino for Marine Turtles) return after 25-30 years and go back to where they were hatched to lay eggs.

Before a person is baptized, he is guilty of Original Sin and, if baptism occurs after the age of reason, of personal sin. When a person is baptized, all personal sin, Original Sin and the punishments due to sin are wiped clean. The baptized believer is thus born again and receives the grace of justification. Protestant terminology says that this person is justified and saved. Catholic terminology says that this person’s soul is in the state of Sanctifying Grace. Not all Protestants believe that baptism is necessary to be justified and saved. But the following passages demonstrate the truth of the Catholic teaching.

“Brooklyn, with 2.6 million people, they want their home team,” Yormark said following three home games — against the Celtics, Heat and Knicks — that brought a lopsided amount of support for the opposition. “The brand Brooklyn has incredible power. It truly does. And wearing Brooklyn on our jerseys is going to mean a lot to everybody in that borough. Well, I don't doubt that a good number of kids will grow up as Brooklyn Nets fans, or that a good number of people want a "home team." There's something tribal about sports, even if, as Jerry Seinfeld would put it, "you're actually rooting for the clothes."
Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.

Yesterday afternoon, a bus from that same school was hit head-on by a car containing a family of four. The two children attended the same school. The family perished in the wreck, 31, 30, 9 and 6 gone in an instant. The car crossed the center line and speed was determined to be a factor in the wreck. I process that as a preventable death. Why was he speeding, what could have been so important to rush and why didn't they just leave 5 or 10 minutes earlier to avoid being so rushed? How come the parents weren't wearing their seat belts but their children were? The grieving team has been deployed to this school, again, fifteen days later.
Although there were certainly many Brooklynites that took strong sides with the Patriots or Loyalists, the area was still thoroughly populated with Dutch farmers at the time and was not known as a hotbed of Revolutionary fervor, which is why, perhaps, Boston and Philadelphia have received so much more ink in the history books.

This story of juvenile delinquency in 1950s Liverpool was one of a series of topical dramas made by director Basil Dearden and producer Michael Relph from subjects ripped from the headlines. Since the 1940s they had alternated more commercial fare (including comedy vehicles for Peter Sellers and Benny Hill) with these properties that took on socially relevant themes with a (fairly) progressive outlook, shooting on location for a more realistic style. They employed box office stars like Dirk Bogarde and John Mills as insurance and to further sweeten the pill often couched their social problem agenda with genre trappings. In the case of Violent Playground they got Stanley Baker to star as a cop and tarted up the plot with pyromania and a climax in which a gunman holds a class full of school children hostage.

On nearly each day we can see pictures from Award ceremonies all over for everything. Why is that? In past times Awards were given for outstanding performance in different categories. The Nobel prize is an example for why an Award should be given – for lasting, intense analysis and research on various fields and outstanding achievements. It is an Award that is given after the results have been proved for a long time period.
Cryptographers mostly work with people who are very entrenched in the fields of mathematics, sociology and game theory. While most entry level jobs are heavier on the interaction with software, the more senior positions deal more with project management and assisting clients in improving their security across the entirety of the client’s business process. The clients are often government branches in need of consulting, banking firms, and other tech companies that need to handle heavy amounts of sensitive information. However, it should be noted that pretty much every single company that works dependently on the internet needs more than one way to protect themselves from attacks.

Saturday, I slept most of the day. My amazing husband knew how tired I was after our eventful week and took care of the kids most of the day. He woke me in the afternoon and told me that Tenli had a slight fever of 99.9. She acted normal most of the day and we gave her motrin to help with her fever. At dinner she didn't eat much; we started baths afterwards and she began to shiver so badly when I undressed her she couldn't hardly talk. When I got her out she was shivering so much her lips turned blue! I waited a while and took her temperature and it was 104.0! I gave her some tylenol and sat with her on the couch for a few minutes before deciding to take her to Kidmed. I figured the earlier we could get antibiotics in her the easier it would be to avoid the hospital! When we got to kidmed she was lethargic and her cheeks were rosy. All she wanted to do was sleep, and would not let go of me! I sat in the waiting room for 45 minutes with her on my lap, after 20 minutes of waiting she vomited all over my shirt and pants! The lady at the desk called out to me that there are bags on the wall, but I was so filled with chunks of food, and Tylenol in my lap that there was no getting up unless she wanted to scrape it up off the floor. FINALLY she brought on over to me, but it was too late she already spewed it all over my lap! I took off her clothes down to the diaper and took her to the bathroom to clean her and me off! As I came out of the bathroom I held her in my arms pacing the floor trying to soothe her to sleep while the heat from her body baked my skin! I paced for about 15 minutes while listening and watching a nurse have a personal conversation with another patient sitting in the waiting room. Getting annoyed (and ready to leave for the ER), I asked the desk clerk how much longer before they could see her and she said, "about 1-2 more minutes." About a minute later the nurse who was having the conversation turned to me and said, "is this Tenli, I'm out here for her...we were just chatting!" I was IRATE! Here I am covered with vomit, rocking my baby who had a 104 degree temp, and was miserable and she was "chatting!" We went back to the room and was seen by the doctor, they did a strep swab, flue swab, and x-ray. She was positive for pneumonia, and negative for everything else.

To these evolutionists, when bacteria lose genes, “reductive genome evolution” is occurring. But they admitted, “There is a tendency in evolutionary discourse to describe life’s history as a progression towards increasing complexity.” So has evolutionary discourse been misguided? Instead of simple-to-complex, was life’s history instead filled with complex-to-simple evolutionary changes such as bacteria losing certain genes?

At times it seemed she was winning, but then others, like now, when it nearly has her beat.

So a perfect circle. Just like 17 years ago, there are still no answers to my mysterious illness. “Nothing can be done”, as Ms. Mitchell says.

I scared the hell out of my dad when I fainted on him while walking to the car on Saturday. I’m pretty self-reliant. But I am so lucky that I have both of them on either side of me at all times, ready and waiting in case I lose my balance.

If you ever go to Disneyland with little bitty kids, I now have a few tricks that will make your day easier: 1. Freeze juice boxes the night before and bring them in a cooler, they thaw and are nice cool yummy drinks! Just the right size too. 2. Bring plenty of water! 3. Bring snacks. This makes your day cheaper and easier to have munchies at hand when the hungries strike! 4. Use the Baby Care Center. Nice place to take a break for mom and the tots alike. 5. Bring Disney toys with you, you know they are already in your toybox, ease the urge to shop and bring 'em along!

Today I have something a little different for you... a paper fan that yes, actually closes up! I wanted to play along this week with the Shining the Light Challenge over on the ODBD Blog to help celebrate Our Daily Bread designs's 4th Anniversary, coming up next Sat!

‘I did feel honoured because I’m a foreigner and I was living in England and I was offered the chance to be an A-lister,’ she insists. ‘Normally I spend a lot of my time solitaire. It just felt a bit weird, because I have to be able to write music, and when I walk down the street I have this music going on in my head. That’s my life, and it felt like a thousand people had moved in there and they were leaving their dirty socks around, so I couldn’t write music. I’m a pretty tough cookie you know, and if I could endure that and still write good music, I would have endured it; but it wasn’t creative, so it had absolutely no interest for me. It was boring.’

Circumstances were different, however, when he invited me to accompany him to Montreux for a conference because it's where we used to live. It's home!

There’s also the question of how much value an entry in the GBG will be to a Wetherspoon’s. In practice, I would say very little. I recognise that some are far better than others in terms of beer quality, beer range and ambiance, but I’d say if you’re inclined to go in Spoons and find yourself in a strange town, you’ll probably go in anyway, and if you’re not you’ll still stay away. And they don’t tend to hide their light under a bushel down alleyways and in back streets. If the beer’s good, you may stay for another, and when you get back to the hotel note that the pub was in the GBG, but it probably won’t influence your decision in the first place. Therefore, from a personal perspective, listing any Spoons is a waste of space – I expect the Guide to lead me to places that I might not otherwise have found.

The Dwemer had clearly delved deep into the mountainside as at one point natural caverns broke the monotony of stone and brass piping. It was here that Se’rith and Brelyna began to see symbols and totems very similar to the one they had seen in Shimmermist Cave and soon enough they stumbled upon one of the blind creatures. Its keen sense of hearing picked up their approach and it launched itself from its perch brandishing a chitin sword that was as sharp as any steel Se’rith had ever seen. As they moved further into the earth they saw many of these dead creatures, what had Mirabelle called them, Falmer. Amidst their twisted corpses the remains of Dwemer constructs were scattered about. Some battle must have been fought here. Maybe the Falmer had settled in the ruins and the constructs, programmed to defend the city, reacted. Judging by the amount of scrap metal these Falmer were to be respected. After a further hour, through which they travelled through natural caverns and attacked by some sort of centipede looking like monstrosity of chitin, they arrived in a large chamber were the largest, and darkest Falmer they had just seen sat on a chitin throne a large gem set in an amulet around its neck.

The publisher, however, which has spent $1225 to get the author to the event, has recouped only $962.14, making their net loss $262.86. (They’ll probably lose even more that if you consider that many publishers now also pay freight costs.) Consider that the average bookstore tour is usually eight to ten cities, and well, that's a considerable chunk of cash to throw away.

What if there had been early recognition by good-government groups of the scope and impact of the project? What if they’d joined with DDDB to created a boroughwide development agenda? What if Marty Markowitz had tried to do so? What if the Citizens Union truly cared about open, accountable government regarding Atlantic Yards?
Jackie: I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, people are rude because they are giving away our music for free before it’s even released. On the other hand, that is the way that fans feed music to other potential fans and we want as many people to hear the music as possible. Free downloading is really changing the way the Music Industry operates and the way labels operate. We’re just not sure what this means for musicians, like ourselves, yet. We write over 60 minutes worth of music, painstakingly record and market it, then… we don’t even get recouped for our time and effort because other people are giving it away freely. I dunno. Like I said, I have mixed feelings!

The future is clearly e-books and apps whether we like it or not. That’s not to say traditional books will die, they won’t. There will always be a place for the book, but even traditional publishers will one day deliver POD books (if they don’t already) as the technology gets cheaper and more accessible. There are already vending machines ‘Espresso Book Machine’ that will print your book in five minutes while you wait. I would like to point out that Lightning Source have a distribution channel into this system also….just thought I’d mention that. So for Peachstone, physical books are quality POD paperbacks, and POD is simply going to get better with time. There’s no shame in that and we are proud to say we provide POD right now. It means we don’t have to stock pile books and only those that are ordered get printed.
I’ll watch TV sometimes. We got rid of a few channels a year or so back because we were paying for nothing. It seems as if we got rid of all the decent channels. I watch a few drama, by a few I mean like three. I’ll catch reruns of scrubs. My television watching has been largely uninteresting for a very long time usually its factual or comedy. In fact it’s a common complaint of mine that we have hundreds of channels and there’s nothing on. Most of the time I won’t even bother turning it on anymore.

These days, I paint because it is my passion. I love watching the ‘magic’ of it. I feel giddy about it. It is not my work, but my play. Sometimes it is so beautiful that it leaves me breathless…the ‘doing of it is’ beautiful; the art isn’t necessarily…but, the ‘doing of it’ always is.

Treachery, deceit, passion, innocence, youth, faith and loyalty – all human follies, rather tragic flaws, are put to their best in a thoughtful plot. This makes it a more telling film about human nature than Pan’s Labyrinth. So, calling it just a ghost story is unfair. The performances by actors, direction and editing do complete justice to the plot. As there’s an element of suspense in the film, delving into more details would be criminal. It’s my favourite film in the horror genre; a must-watch for frail hearts too.
Parts of the bridge have had to be rebuilt at various times. During the English Civil War for example one arch was demolished, the bridge also had to be partially rebuilt after damage during a great storm and flood in 1588.
And unfortunately, it was to the detriment of my sweet baby boy’s happiness. After a few months, he would literally start crying at the sight of my coupon binder. He knew that seeing it meant he’d be spending the next couple hours sitting in a shopping cart, bored to death. And this was like five days per week.
Last year the Democratic Alliance set out in some detail the amount of money an ANC executive was spending on luxury cars. They also detailed the huge amounts being wasted on conferences and advertising.
In the backyard, a pool was ready for neighborhood kids — both black and white — who he said loved to come over after school for a swim. Mr. Neesmith, a former school bus driver, and his late wife had been foster parents to dozens of children.
I found this wonderful bread recipe over at Crazy Mom Quilts and let me just say – YUM! I made the recipe (with a couple of changes – honey instead of sugar and added whole wheat flour instead of all white) and once the dough cycle on the bread machine was complete I opened the lid to a HUGE ball of dough. I figured that this was just way too much for one loaf pan so ended up making two smaller loaves – this works great if you’re trying to watch what you eat – smaller slices are still so very, very satisfying.
The iconic views from the Eiffel Tower or Sacré Coeur reveal hundreds of attractions for the snap happy visitor, while mime artists and characteur painters dwell in the tourist crouds.
Suddenly like someone had slapped me back into reality, because truly the Lord is the most real thing I know, I got into agreement with my son. I just remember saying Lord your word says and took off on his words to me! Immediately, my Lord performed a miracle! My son’s hand or actually it turned out to be his finger, immediately stopped bleeding and his finger had a thin scab instantly cover the cut! Yes I know that this sounds incredible, but I am telling the truth. He went from blood dripping down his arm and off his elbow, to scab on the finger instantly! Yay we came down the track with our arms raised high and screaming cheers to the one who knows how to take good care of us, especially in our times of desperation! As a mother, I felt desperate to get my child help and to remain calm which obviously at first I was failing miserably at, but then Thank GOD! Some of the training that we’ve been training our child with kicked in for him and Viola! GOD truly is an on time GOD that heard a cry from his child!
All the time which was previously wasted consumed with thoughts about alcohol, with actual drinking and with being hungover, can now be used for something beneficial.

The Green Standard:
My lunch partner's starter of mussel and saffron soup was decent enough, but my bland autumn vegetable "cook pot" came with a side order of worm. Yes, you heard me right. The attitude of the staff was very "har har har, more protein for you". Nice. It happens I know.
So I went onto Twitter to rant.
The day of the competition Tina got to my room at eight-thirty am already in dress, hair and makeup. She did my makeup, while another amazing friend (that I know reads this blog) did my hair. The list was checked and they both killed it, I looked amazing. We cut the elastic off my fish nets, I strapped into the pink sparkly dress, tossed on my satin slippers and when I glanced in the mirror, looked and felt like a Disney princess.
I did not know this word you call 'Bored.' And I did not return to the house until the streetlights came on.

Craft beer enthusiasts usually have little to no use for "North American industrial lager" beers, particularly "light" beers. Many craft beer aficionados lampoon the presence of a "light beer" tap at an establishment like Max's or Mahaffey's, or even the brewing of a "lawnmower light" or "mild ale" at a brewpub.

I was looking at an interactive map of home prices from NAR the other day and it was easy to see that Boise home prices are much lower than any other metro area in the Western US. Boise house prices used to be comparable with Spokane Washington, until the boom of 2005-2007. Now, our home prices are over $30,000 below Spokane.
Chandler & Orion leave Jonah and the boy out in the desert to die, except Orion has compassion & drops a canteen for them. Carrying the boy, Jonah starts off on foot. A few days later Jonah wakes up in a cabin being tended to by a lovely woman. He had appeared, almost dead, on their doorstep. The boy had a fever but since Jonah gave him all the water, taking none for himself, the boy is now well. Jonah recovers from his dehydration, purchases a horse & pistols from the woman's father & takes off after the escapee & his buddy, but not before the woman takes note that Jonah is so gentle & kind.

So I purchased the 1940 Spare-Time game, Rook (a 1924 card game for pairs of players, which had been my grandfather’s favorite), Flinch (a 1963 game my father had played as a child), and a game called Matchet (for which we could find no information at all). I passed up a golf-themed game with an $18 price tag, and ended up spending a grand total of $14 dollars.
1. Children in foster care are victims of severe abuse and/or neglect. On top of this, they have been taken away from their entire family, friends, school, home, everything they have known their whole life, and adjusting to a completely new life. They need a lot of attention, care, and love. Because we do not currently have children in our home we are open to almost every possible situation, and have the time to make sure each child placed with us will have their various needs met. I also have a very flexible work schedule which is needed for taking our foster children to various appointments with doctors, therapists, school evaluations, relative visits, and a lot of times court hearings.
Good make-out is more than just kissing, because kissing by itself is like food without seasoning. The salt and pepper of a smooch session are the little things, like some nibbling, a little hair-pulling, deep eye contact and so on. A skilled make-out artist knows the value of piano and forte, of innocence and raunch, and of fast and slow.
Until this week I had never used its photo editor and I must admit that I was impressed because I was able to use all the features I would of used in Picnik to edit my image. Photobucket isn’t as user friendly or as pretty as Picnik but it has all the basic features. It is less intuitive and you do have to seek out the features you are looking for. But after a while I got use to where everything was.

And it is they, (Mujahidin) who fight against the enemies of Allah in order that the worship should be all for Allah (Alone and not for any other deity) and that the Word of Allah (swt) (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allah (swt) and His religion Islam) should be superior. Allah has made them (Mujahidin) partners in reward along with all those who guard Islam with their weapons, along with their good deeds which they performed even if they sleep in their homes.

But is this really the case? Is epic fantasy so locked into a ditch where all of these huge flaws are part-and-parcel of much of fantasy, especially its strongest-selling sagas? Or is Simon writing back to not only 1977, but also 1987 and 1997? Has he missed the past 15 years, with Stephen Erickson, George R. R. Martin, R. Scott Bakker, and Tad Williams?
These projects are mostly based around patterns and fabric I already have, as I really want to make the most of my existing resources. I found that a bit of planning was helpful AND I have Me Made May in my sights, so want to get a few new garments completed for that.

I am having a special event for my sister Jayme. She is in her early 50's and has terminal lung cancer. To make it worse, her sweet dachshund Molly passed away a couple weeks ago. Today we learned her cancer has spread to several other areas and her time is running out. I am asking for all my card making friends to send her a fun card...not really get well cards obviously, but something pretty or funny that will make her smile. She is a frog collector so frog cards would be awesome! I have been blessed by all those I design for to have a wonderful offer of blog candy. Details are below on how to enter. I will choose a winner June 2nd.
Sketch cards are small. They fit in the palm of your hand. One of the greatest quests in the sketch card medium is the challenge of fitting as much detail and emotion as humanly possible into a three-inch cardboard canvas. Edward Cherniga has just perfected the art.
Now, this year:
Most of this type of advice had the same theme: "Now that you are a parent, the needs of your children are more important than your needs. The time for being selfish about what you want is over." I see where this comes from, I even see a certain nobility in it; after all, many parents exhibit behaviors throughout the lives of their children that make connecting as a family nearly impossible. For many years, getting married and having children have been portrayed in our society as "rites of passage", in which we are expected to put aside our old behaviors in order to grow up and become more mature. Many of the rituals we have adopted as a society enforce this concept; think about large graduation and bachelor parties, for example. It is easy to view marriage and having children as passages, when we move from a time of relative selfishness and irresponsibility to a time of maturity and growth. And because this move is "traumatic" for some people (which is often assumed, regardless of whether or not it's true), people feel free to offer advice on how best to adjust quickly and thoroughly. New parents are often told to stop thinking of themselves so they can focus on their children. Many try to do just that - and it's easy to do, given all of the demands of parenting, especially in the first few years.

Unfortunately, Ms. Lopez's schoolgirl crush on Mitt Romney (which, at least, is properly directed at a man and not at other schoolgirls) somehow blinded her to a statement by Romney in the very same article she linked to. "I want to bring Michigan back," said Romney. "I'm not willing to sit back and say, 'too bad for Michigan. Too bad for the car industry. Too bad for the people who've lost their jobs; they're gone forever. That's not the kind of pessimism I think that will make Michigan strong again.'" I'm not quite sure how she missed this quote, which was roundly attacked by other Republicans who asserted that not only would Romney not be able to bring their jobs back, he shouldn't try or even care. A real Republican should sound like Rep. Michele Bachman of Minnesota who said in a statement supporting the Middle Class Protection Act, which would protect the middle class by giving corporations a 25% tax cut that will eventually trickle down to the workers who still have jobs: "I am so proud to be from the state of Minnesota. We’re the workingest state in the country, and the reason why we are, we have more people that are working longer hours, we have people that are working two jobs."
Former Chicago Bears receiver David Terrell was arrested Friday and charged with domestic battery after he threatened to throw his ex-girlfriend off a balcony during an argument at his apartment in Chicago.
We do a lot of bowling. Living in a small town, there’s not a lot you can do as a family. It’s too cold to take the kids to the park. It’s too cold for camping. We all like to bowl, so that is what we do. When you are bowling, there are certain things that are considered proper bowling etiquette. There are also certain things that are unspoken rules.

The fire was put out now (something Creme had a little something to do with; her attempt at an ice spell turned into water that put out the fire (sure, it was hot water, but at least it wasn’t more fire)) and they were in the tent. In theory trying to sleep. It was really kind of awkward to be in the same tent as the draenei, right next to her in fact. She knew Brulee wasn’t asleep yet; she always breathed more heavily when she was sleeping. Not that Creme knew from staying up late and trying to sneak away at night. Nope, not at all.
Ever since we found out Sherman would be joining our family, Paddy and I have been tossing around ideas about what to do with the bed situation. We were fortunate enough to borrow a crib for Bug when she was born. When we brought her home from the hospital, we put her in a pack n' play that had a higher bassinet level for infants and was situated conveniently right next to my side of the bed.

I was originally going to make the hero her age (early 50′s) who threw away his career to be a writer in Paris.

Here is the thing. I DRIVE them to school every morning and I pick them up at the end of school. The only time they are outside is during a 20 minute recess. I suppose you could count the 5 minutes in the am before school and the 5 minutes in the afternoon after school. They are not on a bus - they are not waiting outside for anything - they don't have to walk 3 miles uphill in 4' deep snow. Get it? The teacher's know this.

Next weekend I am throwing a bridal shower for my cousin Keltsey. I am so excited for this! Well, I am excited for every party I throw, but I think I have some really cool ideas for this one and I'm hoping to step it up a notch. I usually throw the showers for my dads side of the family so they are subjected to all my schemes and ideas. Hopefully they like them? Well no one has taken my title as official shower-thrower for the family so I guess that's a good sign. :)

Maybe I don’t have a writing problem. Maybe I just have a complaining problem.
Accept the parts of yourself that you don’t think are so great or that you think others will judge you for. Like yourself, feel calm, centered and don’t need to react to everything in motion around you. Don’t panic or get angry because someone else does. Be ok with who you are and what your experience is. Whether they rally around in support of you or against you, know that you have taken the steps you could take and that you’re capable of taking further steps needed.

It seems from the '39-45 Living History Society' that the Chaplain of the 9th Paras, Rev J. Gwinnett, who would have been known to my uncle Private Daniel Roderick Hurley, not only cared for the dead and wounded of the Paras, but also of the German enemy troops.
There are over 400 types of grasses and all are edible. As long as you don’t spray your lawn with pesticides, etc. You could literally eat your lawn. The leaves can be chewed and the juices swallowed – though be sure to spit out the un-digestible fibers because grass is extremely high in fiber. Unless you’re blending it in a blender, it will be too much fiber at one time to process which will lead to extreme constipation. So again, chew it well, swallow the juices and spit out the pulp. Where the base of the leaves meet the root is a small white part of the stem/root structure, called the root corm, while small these can be roasted and eaten like a potatoes.

But the reality was that it was extremely disheartening to me. Dumping my entire mana pool and fighting to get regen from Telluric Currents just to help keep the raid alive on spread-out fights (Omnitron, I’m looking at you) was not my idea of fun. Being told by pug groups that “shamans suck, reroll” was not fun. Probably only other shaman who played through the raid content on a progression level can understand the frustration that made many of us more competitive players reconsider our class choice.
Google is a wonderful thing. Google found me my dream retreat. Nestled in the middle of the picturesque Devonshire village of Sheepwash, Deborah Dooley's house, a thatched cottage with the most gorgeous inglenook fireplace and the most comforting, welcoming atmosphere, is the place all writers wish they could be.
That being said, a lot of the frustration and extra work came from learning tips and tricks that I will now share with you and you won't have to learn or figure out on your own.

So my sister and I headed out to San Bernardino for the concert. I had been to the Glen Helen Ampitheater before (now its called the San Manuel Ampitheater) and I am still pleased with this venue. It didn't take long to get there, parking was easy, and short walk to the entrance. Then once you enter the food, restrooms, and access to the lawn section were all right there. The lawn seats weren't bad at all unlike other venus I've been to.

DOOMSDAY is not a funny movie to watch as there’s precious little humor spread throughout the tale, so I wouldn’t call it a great popcorn flick, but if you’re looking for a good, serious, sci-fi actioner, DOOMSDAY will foot the bill. There is a definite “throw everything against the wall” feel to the film as plenty of scenes in this movie make you think of other films: Mad Max, Escape from New York, Omega Man, A Boy and His Dog, etc. (Heck, even two characters are named “Carpenter” and “Miller” as nods to the directors John Carpenter and George Miller.) It works for me, though, because Marshall makes them all his own. Even though there are nods to other movies, it’s all filtered through Marshall’s lens and DOOMSDAY’s worldview.
It was true. It still is, to a certain extent. I’m not saying that all Food Network chefs are hacks. I’m just questioning the way we treat the boys vs the girls. Take a moment some time to Google images of Food Network chefs, both male and female. Female chefs, especially the younger ones, have usually done at least one photo shoot where they are scantily clad (or at the very least featured in surprisingly low-cut shirts/dresses and playing directly into some fantasy of domestic life where they lick spoons and forks and eat strawberries and give the camera “come hither” stares.

Thus, because heaven had great high walls, older churches almost always had a lot of verticality. The lower foundational walls gave way to the higher clerestory, and above the clerestory the vaults of the ceiling rise even higher. And in the lower sections of the walls, extending even as high as the clerestory, the jewel-like stained glass recalls the precious jeweled gemstones described in the lower walls of heaven, according to Revelation 21.
Brod died in 1968. His will concerning the Kafka archive was ambiguous. Depending on who is asked, he left it to his secretary (and reported lover) Esther Hoffe, or the National Library of Israel. Hoffe ended up with the papers, spread out over various bank vaults, deposit boxes, and shoeboxes. The strange odyssey of Kafka’s papers entered a new phase.

Finally, I think that I should address the remembrance of September 11, 2011. The horror of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center will certainly be something that I will never forgot. However, not at the time, nor at any time after, have I lived with the illusion that we all of the sudden became some hyperbolized haven for liberty and tranquility, and that our subsequent military interventions were benevolent conquests to spread freedom to people that were wallowing under the manacles of violent despots, just waiting to be released.

I’ll never forget when I was little and played softball on a team, my dad was SO excited that finally one of his girls wanted to play a sport he could get behind. (He always wanted boys), so he helped coach me and we practiced endlessly. My dad is a hardass. Think of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, and the characters they usually have. The ones that say what they think without really worrying about the consequences afterwards. He’s not unkind, in fact he’s a pretty cool guy… He just isn’t as lovey dovey as my mom is, and how I’ve always been. I always tried different ways to spend time with him because he didn’t really make a crazy effort, so the fact that I was doing something that made him seek me out to interact was SO cool. One day we were practicing before a game and I was the starting pitcher for the team (something he was so proud of and still talks about how good I was at it). He was helping me warm up and I was probably 11-12 at the time, he always threw the ball so hard that it made the huge CRACK sound on the glove and felt like your arm was going to fall off, but it made him so proud that I always caught it and ran for it that I did it without hesitation. He had been on me about not paying attention and “watching” the ball…. so I should have probably kept a better eye out (oh, the irony) when all the sudden SHOOTING PAIN goes through my whole body and I honestly think for a moment that my head has fallen off. The ball connected with my face and I fell to the ground holding my eye and screaming, my mom rushed over and punched him in the arm and then tended to me. He felt bad…but he also threw in the whole “Come on champ, walk it off, you have a game soon.” My mom was just glaring at him like he had thrown gas on me and threw a match… I was proud. He expected me to be able to shake it off and get back out there, like one of the boys! I know that most 11-12 year old girls wouldn’t be happy to be one of the boys…but I sure was! I loved making him proud and showing him and everyone else just how tough I was (still am!). I didn’t cry. I got up, shook it off, and went back to practice. Biting my lip so I didn’t burst into tears every time I felt my pulse beating inside my face. I pitched an almost perfect game that night, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen my dad any prouder of me. The purpose of this story… is to talk about my day today! It’s my firm belief that we are who we are based on what happens to us and what we take from it.

Okay, perhaps I should start by saying maybe this post is NSFW. I have learned that on the internet NSFW means – “Not Suitable For Work”. However, since I’ve already put both clit and d*ck in the title, it may be too late. So, if your boss has peeked over your shoulder and fired you, I’m sorry. But, let me just say – you were too good for that job anyway.

We had been 'using' LEM Phonics, but when you have as relaxed a routine as we do, it's not ideal to have a program which needs a regular, solid block of time each day. So far we like AAS a lot. Why? It's quick, easy and fun, and I love that it doesn't zap all the desire to write out of the kids, so they still want to ... Write!!!
Though religious standards can give relief to a traditional-gone-wrong perception of roles, religion can also be oppressive. There are religions that dehumanize a woman’s existence.
Proof that low budget doesn’t necessarily mean shoddy production values, several of the entries distinguish themselves with remarkable cinematography. For those taking advantage of DV’s unique capabilities, we would single out the films of Zhang Yuan, Park Ki-young, John Akomfrah, Shinya Tsukamoto, Song Il-gon, and Pen-ek Ratanaruang. While there are several instances of fine lensmanship, in terms of acting, (aside from the wonderful ensemble piece Magician(s)) there are lamentably few standout performances across the twenty-seven short films in the compilation. First place would have to go to Jin Xing for her “role” as herself in Zhang Yuan’s documentary. Because of the lackluster transfer, the eclectic nature of the collection, the lack of bonus material and the pricetag, this set can only be recommended to the more intrepid collector. The Jeonju Digital Project (2000-2008) is available at JIFF’s website.

The problem seems to stem from a belief that the grape has to be picked when super-ripe in order to show the full of array of aromas and flavours. As a consequence the wines can often be oily instead of delicate and leave an unbalanced bitter aftertaste – unless severely chilled.
Over the course of a few millenia, gold became a globally accepted money purely as a result of voluntary actions. Paper and electronic money on the other hand, require government legal tender laws for its creation. Gold can’t come into being merely by a stroke of the keyboard or by putting some ink on paper. It requires labor. It has independent demand. It is subject to the forces of supply and demand just like every other product. Gold, in short, is a private market money and it has been for thousands of years.

Crafts picked up sixth-tenths of a point of case share in supermarkets during the four weeks ended May 5, according to beer sales statistics from Nielsen. Crafts have been gaining share for more than three years. (emphasis added)
The remedy for these draining behaviors is to start shifting your attitude. Journaling about this can help. Ask yourself, “Is there a particular trigger that creates the situation? If so, then how can you avoid the trigger? How can you become aware of when you fall into this attitude? Are there people you respect who could help you?” Now write out an action plan to shift these attitudes. Remember to be kind to yourself and begin with small changes – baby steps. Taking action can help solve the problem quickly as opposed to many emotional vampires who stay stuck in patterns for years. I promise: your relatives, friends, and coworkers will appreciate your efforts and your relationships will dramatically improve!

One may say that this only mirrored the dreadful crimes Germany committed in Poland, but I think that's a cop-out, because those who suffered weren't necessarily the guilty parties. Neither the children who died in freezing cold railway carriages, or the little girl with the bleeding feet deserved what happened to them. Nor, I think, had my crusty old great-grandfather from the mountains, who hated the Nazis, and, having been deported at the age of ninety, died in a displaced persons' camp in the new East Germany, refusing all my grandfather's attempts to bring him to the west, because he couldn't believe he'd never see his home again.

And you know what's sad? I don't know that I miss it all that much. I think when I start to really miss it, I will make the time to create.... and the mojo will flow.
Naturally, that person's responsibility is just like a mother that suddenly decided to breastfeed her one and only newborn baby in the middle of a battlefield overrun by nazis during World War II. It's that bad.

I spent several hours with Jordan and his parents after his death. When his mother cried and asked for blankets to warm his cold body, I brought them to her. When his father asked "why?" over and over again, I gave whatever poor comfort I could. When they asked that I wait until friends brought Jordan's favourite stuffed dog to accompany him to the morgue, I told them I'd wait as long his parents needed. Mostly, I just listened, helpless in the whyfors of such undeserved suffering.

European women naturally have hair that is more brightly and diversely colored (Shekar et al., 2008; Steggerda, 1941). This is consistent with a need to attract prospective mates, since bright and/or novel colors are more likely to be noticed and remembered. Most alleles aren’t sex-linked, so this kind of sexual selection would have spilled over on to European men,
I finally wised up and decided to just concentrate on my siblings or my father on future April Fool’s Day. I was tired of hearing the damn boy crying wolf story to last me a lifetime.

I know now that I have always been a woman inside. So much of the way that I have seen things over the years tells me that I have always tried to talk myself out of the truth. That all those feelings would go away. Probably explains why I got married. I figured if I got married, ( I truly do love my wife of 40 years ) all those female thoughts would be replaced with the "man of the house" behavior. I now know those thoughts could and would never go away. I know all this is true now.
Unlike normal short stories, this one had to be based on a virtual treasure trail – I had to spend a few days following clues around a world that took my avatar through terrifying worlds, an actual hades, foggy islands, and at one point, something spectacularly out of Shakespeare’s MacBeth (one of my favourites of the man). My favourite was the little cottage with a murdered body on the floor.
I’d better warn you though – watch this with the sound down, because the backing song is really, really annoying.
From here you can continue to cook on the hob for another 15 minutes. While you’re doing so, blanche a few handfuls of cavolo nero or savoy cabbage in boiling water for 4 minutes. Drain immediately and rinse under cold water.

I’m jealous of (one of) my American roommates. She also suffers with insomnia and depression. She arrived here a month ago at the hospital. She wouldn’t speak, eat, shower and all the rest of it, totally out of it and sobbing in her bed all day. Give her 2 1/2 weeks on an SSRI and she’s like a different person! Putting make up on, getting out of her PJs in to clothes, showering, eating, shouting, smoking, full of confidence. She, however, was still having problems with her sleep, much like I have been even though I’m on an SSRI (Prozac) and 600mg (!) Seroquel. She’s been given just 25mg of Seroquel and has been sleeping like a baby! Seriously, I am indestructible.
I posted a long time ago in Wrath about which presence to use, but that post is now totally out of date. I’m posting this now because my old post still gets a lot of traffic and it needs to be corrected, and also because I’m starting to play a DK again and I’m having to retrain myself as well. Heck – I still switch to Blood sometimes by habit.
Last Thursday I woke up and checked my email on my phone before I even got out of bed. Normally, I just go through and delete all the junk mail that has come through during the night. But I came across one email that had "Cleared case" in the subject line.
The ornate former theatre was leased by Grupo Ilhsa in February 2000. Ilhsa, through Tematika, owns El Ateneo and Yenny booksellers (totaling over 40 stores), as well as the El Ateneo publishing house. The building was subsequently renovated and converted into a book and music shop under the direction of the architect Fernando Manzone; the cinema seating was removed and in its place book shelves were installed. Following refurbishment works, the 2,000 m² (21,000 ft²) El Ateneo Grand Splendid became the group's flagship store, and in 2007 sold over 700,000 books; over a million people walk through its doors annually.

A movie without a love triangle? LOVE. Like i said before, triangle is pointy. It hurts other people’s feelings. It is not a friendly shape. I’m very happy with the way they drifted apart. Just between the two of them, no extras, no cheating, just them.
Off to get dressed (for riding, because I have shit to do today before work, if he doesn't tell me not to bother coming in tonight) and go speak to the soon-to-be-former boss.

"'Ware the Gate!" Dagdan's cheery shout cut Van Raighan off. Pevan spun on the spot, closing the Gateway beneath the Witness as his headlong dive delivered him, upright and almost banging his head on the ceiling, into the jail. His feet landed flat on the paved floor with barely a sound, no sign of the stumble that anyone less experienced would make. Dagdan might be getting on towards forty, but he was barely out of breath. Still smiling, he said, "Wildhawk, Pevan. Get going."
The Weirdos – Vol 1 & Vol 2. Can’t say I’m too crazy about these guys. A lot of their songs are just ho-hum to me. I REALLY like “Terrain” & “Fallout”, and also “We Got The Neutron Bomb”. And I really like “Terrain”, “Cyclops Helicopter”, even “Weird World”. And “I’m Not Like You” definitely gets me to identify with the lyrics. And some other songs are okay: “Destroy All Music”, “It Means Nothing”, “Solitary Confinement”. But alot of the songs are bland: “Rhythm Syndrome”, “Jungle Rock” (which I would be happy to never hear again in my life), “Hey Big Oil”, “Fat Back”, “Barbaric Americana”.
The DLA publication’s article reflects fulsome praise for the various schemes with grandiose names – there is the Bray Housing Development, the Bray Farmworkers Equity Scheme and the Bray Cooperative Enterprise. North West premier Popo Molefe promised financial support to the projects and “in that gesture, he was supported by the President”, said the publication.
It may seem funny to say that we're taking a trip in their honor, but we got a small sum of life insurance upon Brigid's death and decided to do something special for our family with it instead of just paying bills or buying a headstone for them. We're so grateful to be here, but constantly reminded of the great cost to our family. I see princesses and wish my girls could be here with me...and then remember that if they were here, we wouldn't be in Disney right now. It's this brutal fluctuation between great joy and great sorrow that happens all

Having a three-book deal is great, but also a little bit scary. We pitched Changeling as a five-book series and Macmillan were very excited by the ideas that I had for the books. The problem is that I don't plot or plan, so the books tend to have a life all of their own and go off into areas that I didn't anticipate at the start. At times I find myself wrestling with them to get them back on track.

In an effort to expand sales into the newer regions of Brooklyn, the Times made a unique deal to Western District newsboys. They would receive stacks of newspapers at a lower cost (one cent per paper) than those sold to Eastern District newsboys (one-and-a-fifth cent per paper). The Times publishers believed this would boost sales by encouraging the Western District newsies to "push sales vigorously in new directions."

This is one of those writing snippets that is vaguely connected to what I do for a living (or did: I was running the NHS Threat Assessment Centre at the time it was written) but is definitely not a security blog. What it is I’m not sure: it doesn’t exactly feel like verse, but it looked really ugly typed out as unformatted prose. :-)
The Island Kids program continues to be managed effectively and to offer a well-received program. The request is for scholarships for the summer camp that the program runs. With an income eligibility test to receive a camp scholarship, the program benefits low and moderate income residents. Last year, the number of applicants for full and partial scholarships exceeded the funds available. This year, the participation in the program is expected to grow again.

All of the Zone Leaders and District Leaders were in the office yesterday after their morning of meetings at the mission home. We have started a picture wall in our little corner and have been putting pics of the missionaries who have come into the mission since we got here. It really helps us learn their names and the Elders and Sisters seem to enjoy it too. Well, Elders Benson and Clayson could not find their pic on our wall since they arrived before we did, so I took this pic of them and it will be on the wall next time they come in. Elder Clayson is from American Fork and he has challenged Dad in a racketball game. His dad is a champion player and has told him not to let the family name get tarnished! I will let you know what happens. Elder Clayson had dinner at our apartment one night and he reminds us so much of Brett that it is crazy.
Here’s the summarized plotline: A couple of guys from New York (Gene Kelly and Van Johnson) fly to Scotland to hunt grouse in the highlands. They get lost and suddenly stumble upon a village. Turns out the village harbors a huge secret. It is locked in time and reappears every 100 years. Every time the villagers go to sleep, when they wake up in the morning, it’s 100 years later. Their minister, Mr. Forsythe, prayed and made a deal with God to protect Brigadoon from evil outside influences – back in 1754, it was witches – by having the village appear for one day at a time and each day a century has passed. Nobody can hurt a village in one day, right? Nobody can leave the village, however, and Brigadoon ahs very specific boundaries – the bridge to the west, the brook to the east, and so on. If anyone leaves the village and doesn’t return within the day, the spell is broken and Brigadoon disappears forever.
