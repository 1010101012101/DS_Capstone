My head is reeling! Chiari Malformation, what???? A side effect that many with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome develop. No one told me this! Dysautonomia? Ugh really? There is such a thing as too much information. I'm overwhelmed and over stressed to say the least. My husband keeps saying "what? Really? Why? When? How?". "Can I sell a kidney?". He's overwhelmed with all of this new information just as I am. It's to be expected. She's our baby. We don't want to think of any of these things happening to her. I mean seriously, we have enough to deal with right now. I just keep telling myself, the more information the better. It hurts, it's frightening but at least we know what to watch out for. If she starts complaining of terrible headaches or pressure then we haul ass to get her a MRI instead of not knowing and it being too late. Better to be over prepared then it is to be ignorant to it and getting blindsided.

I bought the bright green sticker on the outside of the envelope on eBay so I don’t really know what gender you are since I didn’t actually attend the conference at witch you spoke. Sorry. I paid good money for the “M. Smoot” sticker to gain access to your closed publishing house, so I hope you appreciate it. I’m sure you did a wonderful, stupendous, fantastic job at the conference and gave a fabulous, mesmerizing, interesting speech. Thanks for being such a helpful, kind, grate editor.

We started dating in March of 1999, so he was off the hook that year, but in 2000, I expected the works and I was sadly disappointed. I was stubborn- heck, I still am- but as the man in the relationship I thought he needed to make the reservations for dinner WITHOUT me having to tell him. He didn't and I refused to make them myself so needless to say, we drove around town for a couple hours trying to get into any restaurant without having to wait for 3 hours for a table. A few hours later, we were both grumpy and hungry and decided to just go to our favorite Tex-Mex joint and enjoyed a fajita dinner and dessert for 2 for less than $20! I realized then that it didn't matter where we ate, whether or not I got chocolate truffles or long stemmed roses. It mattered that we were together.
Every guy in the world knows what I mean by the title.. You know it when you’re in the presence of a real woman. A strong woman. The type of woman who demands your attention, whether you want her to or not. But what are the characteristics of these types of women? How did they get that way? Furthermore, how should men interact with these women?

Today while waiting for bread to rise I had some fun creating another journal page. I used a background spread I had done a while ago and added a wonderful quote by Longfellow. Considering the grey clouds outside, it just seemed like a good choice. I started by adding an umbrella cut out of a page of text and then I added the quote.
If I see a sign that says "engine-room", I know there's likely to be an engine in there. Or that a "store-room" will be used for stores. But I can fairly well assume, in America, that most bath-rooms don't have baths. Unless that low thing, with a seat and a pool of cold water is a foot-bath.

Since when does an eight-ounce jar of Hellmann’s cost more than $2.00? I just saw a jar for $2.39 at my local grocery store. It’s not exactly a specialty retailer either, much as neighbors of Scottish descent would tell you otherwise. Two dollars and 39 cents. The number made me think longer about a simple mayo purchase than I ever, ever have. Why didn’t I simply pick up a different, cheaper brand? Noooo, nooo, nooo, nooo, noooo; not with mayo. I had to survey what’s on the market for an article once, and what I encountered engendered a loyalty to Hellmann’s bordering on stranglehold. (And don’t get me started on Miracle Whip, which I’m convinced owes its market share to childhood memories.) So I stared and stared and stared at the pricey little jar. If mayo’s is going to cost this much, I may as well make it myself. I sensed an experiment coming on.
I prefer to keep most things put away (and off counters), but I think this Headband Organizer looks cute in the bathroom. It may be the main guest bath in the house, but it's also the kid's (when they aren't invading ours!).

Janet Evanovich is one of my favorite authors and even after reading a book of hers I can go ahead and read it again and it's still as entertaining as the first time. This book was a fast read. It's one of those books that I love to read on a rainy day.

I looked forward to reading this book so much, I put aside others that I had been hoping to read next. The story of Coco Chanel and her life during World War II is presented by Hal Vaughan who claims to have exposed the reality of Coco Chanel and her collaboration with the enemy.
I remember “I Hate You” in an ironic way. The song deals with being in love with a cheater, and hating the cheater for it. Yet, because of the love ballad groove, people slow danced to it…including yours truly. A masterpiece in the same vein of the Police’s “Every Breath You Take”, it sounds beautiful on the surface. Yet, when you listen to the lyrics, the song ain’t what you think it is. Lyrics about stalking an ex-lover and lyrics about a cheating woman ain’t necessarily baby-making music. Yet, both songs serenade you anyway.

Well, Sara, Caleb and I are heading to the North American Christian Convention in downtown Cincinnatti. What is this? well, our church is not a denomination, but a loosely affiliated "movement" sometimes called the "stone/campbell movement" - mostly "Christian churches and Churches of Christ". Anyway, for about 60-70 years there is this annual gathering of all these churches where these Christ-followers from all over the country and from this background come (I'd expect about 5,000 to attend). We'll spend the week listening to great preaching (usually four main sessions a day and this year's theme is the book of Acts - go figure). There are also workshops on various ministry topics (literally hundreds of them) and then a variety of meetings and appointments that I'll take in. But it's really reconnecting with old ministry friends - sometimes people you haven't seen in years that makes this thing special for me. It's a very spiritually uplifting time for me. I would guess that in my 46 years, I've been to about 20 of these things (my first one was in Dallas when I was six - which is where this Indy boy became a Cowboys fan! My favorite one was Indianapolis in 1994 where I got to preach to the teen session of the convention and over 3,500 students. All my family and homeboys and girls were there (and yes, I realize Homeboys as an expression is outdated)

When I was in college at Sam Houston State in Huntsville in the 1980s, there was a rundown old mansion on the north end of the campus. Originally a private residence, it was converted into a sorority house in the ‘30s. Eleanor Roosevelt was an overnight guest. (Imagine the pillow fights!) Campus legend held that the house was later home to a group of Satan worshipers who painted the ceilings black. Eventually a fraternity took the old place over.

She spoke such amazing truth to me, not holding back! This is her passion and it showed. She basically was telling me that I cannot protect Ella. But God can! That I cannot guard her emotions but God can and will. That I cannot guarantee a baby staying with us, but God knows. That I cannot control my heart breaking many times through this process, but God has already supplied the grace needed.

The frog's name was Post-it. Mama had once gotten lost in an office and had taken note of potential names for sticky things. It was always so difficult to name several thousand babies every spring!

We discussed our perceptions about living in the suburbs, some true (like it can be a fake, sheltered bubble) and some false (that somehow we are less holy for not living in poverty). The leaders of the seminar, also from Orange County, talked about the suburbs as having all of the problems of the inner city (drug/alcohol abuse, sexual abuse, financial problems, family brokenness, homelessness), just as being better hidden, with an additional complication…wealth. Stewardship of one’s resources is a serious concern for those who live in suburbia.

My flower cones are going to be filled with green and purple hydrangeas. The white roses above were just added to the finished design so that I could get an idea how it would hang with flowers in it. I made all eight of mine in a little over an hour, minus the time it took to take an emergency trip to the craft store to buy more ribbon. I'm really pleased with how they turned out, I keep pulling them out of my wedding box to look at them, it's like I can't believe I made something that looks so elegant. The icing on the cake is that you can purchase handmade flower cones online through various crafting sites for upwards of $10 EACH. I didn't even spend a dollar each for mine, and they are custom for my wedding and theme. Until next time!
It is at this seminary where the other artisans gather daily to create the pieces that you wear so stylishly. The group eats together, laughs together, and cries together.

2:00 left in 1st Quarter. Hell, U of H is running all over these boys. They make it to the red zone and then stall out of an offsides penalty. Houston's field is good and they have now run 27 plays to UCLA's 3. Damn shame. Funny how they are showing the quarterbacks drafted recently who are Kennum's age.

Washington DC is, of course, the nation’s capitol. It’s the place where all the old white guys pretend to do important things. This is going to have nothing to do with politics (though I do have plenty of opinions there too) and everything to do with the city itself. I know the American education system is terrible so just in case anyone wasn’t sure, DC is not in Washington state and it has nothing to do with it. DC is technically not in any state but now we’re getting into complicated and boring Civil War politics. The city is actually wedged between Maryland and Virginia, making it an East Coast city; and that means that it’s also full of ghettos. It’s also home to a lot of monuments, including one that looks like a dick, and plenty of museums and other touristy things (okay, maybe something important accidentally happens there).

I think it’s fair to say, being a mother is a difficult task. Some of us do it well, some, not so well, but we never set out to be bad moms. We all try to do the best we can within the parameters of our circumstances. In other words, there’s no “owner’s manual.” I believe that our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we have become. That holds truth for our kids, as well.
Overall, Getting to Know the Church Fathers is a helpful, lively, and accessible introduction to the early Christian church. This book will help evangelicals who are unfamiliar with patristic church history grow familiar with their spiritual ancestors and the issues, places, and events that shaped early Christianity. Litfin’s closing exhortation is a welcome one for evangelicals longing for a breath of fresh, ancient air to give life to a contemporary, and sometimes stale, faith: “Embrace your inner catholic, and see where it will take you” (p. 265).

At the same time, I’m working on a longer-term project (one that’s been on my desk for a long time) which will give readers a front-row seat to the two most important trials ever—the trial of Christ and the trial of Paul in front of Nero.

While trying to come up with a challenge idea for the "My Scraps is Thankful for..." contest going on this month at My Scraps & More, I came across this quote printed on a sheet of Jillibean Soup paper and inspiration immediately struck. I had recently looked through old photos and these popped into my mind as the perfect photos to use; they aren't great quality photos, however they are silly and capture the essense of that little spark of madness that Skylar and Emily showed here (OK- Skye has A LOT of madness- she does these things daily, Emily, not so much). So I created a challenge around the quote and these photos; I am thankful for silliness. The challenge was/is to use silly photos and at least 5 different patterns. Here is the layout I ended up with.

The sad thing is, when I was growing up, we just didn’t have the kind of horror books available to children today. Even Goosebumps came too late for my generation! So I went from reading the perennially popular Roald Dahl to Stephen King, by way of Sherlock Holmes and Edgar Allan Poe. So, really, I have nothing to compare the current crop of phenomenally talented YA horror writers to.

So today I did the full body strength and conditioning. And I was pumped when I was going through the warm-up. And half way through the warm-up I remembered what was in store for me. Some of my pumped-uppedness (yes I know I am making up words) turned into fear. First round… squats and hindu push-ups! Repeat! And repeat again! And again! And wait yes repeat again! I HATE round one! I was sweating so much by the end of round one, I didn’t know if I had any sweat left. But I was unnecessarily concerned, I had enough sweat to see me through the other 5 rounds. I think I did a couple of real push-ups in round one. Thats new for me.

Isn't that bracket GORGEOUS? Its even more gorgeous in person! I first created my flower by punching several circle with my circle punch. I wet them and crunched them up and dry them with my heat gun, cause I didn't have patience to wait. I rounded the corner of the grey wool cs and white daisy cs and Buttercup yellow with my corner rounder. I then layered the grey wool and white daisy onto my buttercup yellow card base. I embossed the bracket and the sentiment in black. I used a glue dot to adhere the flower onto the card. I added 2 pieces of striped grey ribbon as the petals.

I remember the day, but not the date. It was a Friday. I received a phone call from my mom. Telling me that you were in the hospital. That I should probably come see you because it may be the last time I got a chance to see you. Trust me, had she known she would have never suggested that. I remember walking into the room. Dad was there, he was pretty upset. Brian was there, he gave me a hug and he was also pretty upset. We stood there bullshitting for a little while. Just being there to support you. Hubs hated it. He hated every single minute of being there. He hated you, rightfully so. We were there for about an hour. In that hour, I never spoke a word to you. Some days I wish I would have. I wish that I would have told you exactly how I felt, exactly how it had changed my life, exactly what I thought of you.

The declaratory theory provides that the moment in which an entity satisfies all the conditions set out in the Montevideo convention the entity is a State.[2] This theory is close in line with the convention itself and the pronouncements of Articles 3 and 6. It however fails to adequately describe the creation of “States” in international practice. There are entities in the world that de facto satisfy the criteria of the Montevideo convention but do not as a general matter benefit from being “States” and do not receive or benefit form the rights that come with such a status. One example that comes to mind is the nominally Moldovan territory of “Transnistria”.[3] This non-State entity has essentially been independent since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It has a territory, a permanent population, a government and has engaged in relations with other States.[4] Notwithstanding its meeting the Montevideo criteria, it does not participate in international affairs as such because it lacks recognition. The lack of empirical validity to the declaratory theory might lead one to believe that the constitutive theory explains State formation, however, like the declaratory theory, it fails to explain the actual formation of States.
It might be a sign that I have read too many of Dr Carson’s books if they no longer truly impact me where I am at any given moment. I have read a lot of his books. I have listened to a lot of his sermons. I have read a lot of his formal journal contributions. I am like a junky for Carson, at one time actually spending money to purchase very poor cassette tape audio recordings of his sermons. But this time I found myself finishing his sentences and skipping over time-worn illustrations and yawning. The Cross and Resurrection of Jesus are amazing, mind blowing, earth shattering, soul undoing events. As Tim Keller notes: If Jesus is who he said he is, then everything changes.

I guess the moral of the story is writers have to believe in their writing. It has to be a part of who we are, in our blood. We have to learn to look at rejections as stepping stones to making our story better. We need to continue to believe in our craft, even when what we get back hurts. We need to find support with fellow creatures of the craft and we have to love ourselves and never give up!

Star anise, cardamom, Szechuan peppercorns. As soon as Chef Julie Coppé encouraged the group of ten women enrolled in the Parisian Soiree cooking class to be bold and creative in our use of spices, I knew that we were in for a real treat. With a master's degree in political science and a technical degree in cooking, Julie is a versatile chef who spent three years under the tutelage of Alain Passard at the renowned restaurant L'Arpège (3 Michelin Stars). Well-versed in traditional French cooking, Julie's approach is innovative and fresh, perhaps because she likes to travel and expose her taste buds to new flavors.

In March of 2001 more than 45 000 Christians united for a Day of Repentance and Prayer at Newlands Rugby Stadium in Cape Town. It was a day of intense intercession that transformed lives and was reflected in a changing city in the months to come. Testimonies of transformation caused the vision to be spread into the rest of South Africa and planning immediately started for similar prayer gatherings in 8 provinces of South Africa for 2002.

The sweetcorn has been sown, and the little strawberry plants put in the strawberry planter… I may have to cover them tonight, as I think there may be some frosts.

For some people, being inject by a needle must be really hurt. Well, Baekhyun also like that too. When his little hand being injected by needle to make his itchy go away, his mouth is keep widened open and letting out a really loud screaming. Is it that hurt? Or Baekhyun only became over reacted? He maybe has trauma to injection needle and until less than 30 minutes after the injection he still holding his arm where he’s being injected.

There are still a few minor things left to do. I plan to get those taken care of soon. It's just really hard to get stuff done during the week between work & working out & all the regular stuff that needs to be done, like eating. I'm sure you noticed in the pictures the lack of face plates on all the outlets. That was something else that I put a ridiculous amount of thought & time into. I made a decision Sunday after getting a few opinions from the family. Now Dean just has to turn off the electricity & change everything out. I don't play with electricity. I could really hurt myself. HA! Also, the decorating isn't done. It's just a plain kitchen until I take the time to put everything back out. I'm just happy all the hard work is done!

According to Rev. Mike Slaughter, the UMC has made a statement on the issue. The UMC statement is, “We mourn and are committed to diminishment of high abortion rates.” I can’t imagine anyone would disagree with this statement. Surely nobody can think they’d like to see more abortions. If we can join together to work on this goal, something might be accomplished.

So we went out to dinner on Wednesday at an Italian restaurant here in Lexington. It was very good food!

Whedon, to my surprise, manages to bring this all together and make it into an enjoyable product. And yes, it's a product, there's no insight in saying so. All of these movies are products. What Whedon remembers, and someone like Michael Bay never knew, is that it is actually possible to take a special effects blockbuster action product and make it a good story about interesting characters.

One reason many are not in a position to “hear” what the Spirit is saying to them personally is because they are distracted by the activity and “storms” that are going on in the lives of those around them. Sometime, we can be affected by the storms in other’s lives…especially if we are closely connected to them by family ties, friendship, working relationships, or even neighbors; but God does not release us from our own personal daily responsibility to “come unto Him, look to Him, listen to Him” to receive rest for our souls. Matthew 11: 28-30.
So there you have it, a sincere thank you from our students to our teachers and staff members. Let’s remember this holiday season those people that we often pass up thanking. Let’s keep in mind that these people are here to help us whenever we need them and keep the school running smoothly. That being said, don’t forget to show appreciation for those making the big impacts in your personal life as well! This is the time of year to enjoy those who we love and care for, so lets do it to the fullest!

The recent external auditors reports on the accounts of political parties for year 2010 released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) revealed that the PDP could not give its account. Given the undue use of money in the 2011 elections by the ruling party to the extent that local and foreign currencies were alleged to have been doled out to delegates at its presidential primaries at Eagles square, we must compel the ruling party to open its books for investigation as subsidy funds may have gone to unsavoury places.

Last night and all day today while cleaning my house, I did a Biggest Loser marathon on Netflix. I was hoping watching would inspire me (which it did) and encourage me (again it did) and it also made me think. The contestants are using a device strapped to their arm called the Bodybugg which tracks their calories, movement, and such stuff. Huh. So, you are telling me that you can strap a device to your arm and it will track your movement and steps and sweat to workout ratio and figure out your calories burned? Huh. At first, I am intrigued and then a thought crosses my mind….CREEPY. It’s like something out of George Orwell’s 1984 where Big Brother is watching you. Really…do you need to test my sweat to workout ratio? And what exactly are you measuring with my sweat? Pretty sure this device was created by people like SOTL man who wants my fat girl skin so they want samples of my sweat to see if my fat girl skin is good enough for their fat girl skin suit. Why else would you measure my sweat to workout ratio? Are you trying to see if my fat skin has loosened enough so now is the time to bring your van up to my driveway and pretend to have a broken arm and load a couch into it? I am so on to you….I am not getting anywhere near your creepy van or your creepy Bodybugg device if it requires my sweat. And also…gross. I already have issues with looking like I was dipped in a vat of grease when I work out because I sweat so badly (partly because I am fat and partly because I am Irish I think) so measuring my greasy fat girl sweat pretty much grosses me out. I wouldn’t want to be the guy in the lab having to run my sweat through tests or whatever devices they have come up with in Big Brother’s lab to see if I am doing exactly what the government wants me to do. A conspiracy I tell you! I shall keep my vat o grease fat girl sweat contained to myself thank you.

One of the things I love about Katie's agent is that she always presses for feedback after auditions, and always passes it on to us. That has been extremely helpful in letting us know what she's doing right, and more importantly what she needs to improve on.
Oswald died as the result of complications following an appendectomy in Egypt, where he had been ministering to British troops through the YMCA. His untimely death at the age of 43 was mourned by thousands of people. He was so well loved by the men he ministered to, that in spite of the fact that he wasn't part of the military, he was given a full military burial in the old British cemetery in Cairo. A cable was dispatched from Cairo to family and friends at home, bearing the simple message, "OSWALD IN HIS PRESENCE." Oswald and Biddy had been married for just 7 years. At the age of 34, she had become a widow and the single mother of a little girl. The real story behind the man's fame began at his death.
She actually baked me a cake. For my birthday.
Capitalism has developed technology and social productivity to the point where plenty for all can be produced. A society of abundance has long been technically possible and it is this that is the material basis for Socialism. Capitalism, because it is a class society with production geared to profit-making rather than meeting human needs, cannot make full use of the world-wide productive system it has built up over the past two hundred or so years. Socialism, making full use of the developed methods of production, will alter the purpose of production. Men and women will be producing wealth solely to meet their needs, and not for the profit of the privileged few.

Ibis, now partially persuaded that the chicken was indeed rather a bit unusual, occasionally took a look over, only to see that Dr. Chickenhiemer was staring at him. “It’s very strange,” thought Ibis to himself, “but somehow I think there is something about that chicken…” Dr. Chickenhiemer ducked down again and clucked quietly.
Subtitled Pride and Prejudice Continues, this book conjectures the life that the lovely and spunky Elizabeth Bennett shared with the taciturn Mr. Darcy after their marriage. First, let me begin by saying that the amount of sex was absolutely ludicrous and I really didn't need to be constantly reminded that Mr. Darcy was, um, well-endowed. Once I got beyond that (to the point where I just rolled my eyes when "it" was mentioned) I really enjoyed this book immensely (no pun intended, really!)

What I do know is that Jesus Christ is enough for me. He is all I need. And I will live to do His will. When what I desperately want doesn't line up with His plan for my life, I will bow my will to His and bless His Name. There is no greater joy than to follow Him where ever He leads. There is no greater joy than to welcome in my life whatever suffering He wants to bring, I know it is always for my highest joy and for the glory of His great Name!

The cigarette was developed by a German company in the 1950s and soon became associated with an international sensibility due to its 'American blend' of various tobaccos from different countries. "The smell of the large far world: Peter Stuyvesant" went the slogan in 1958. It was test marketed in New York in 1957. Stuyvesant was not the only Dutch historical figure to make his cigarette debut that year; Rembrandt cigarettes also hit the streets of New York that year.
We drove around for about 5 more days in a ghetto bus with a velour interior and outer space-themed curtains. We went camping on the Steppe (I took this opportunity to make a million “Steppe” puns- lemme see you one, two Steppe), went to the largest Buddhist temple in Europe, spit off a bridge which unites Europe and Asia (my saliva was forever lost in the continental divide), visited a place called “Chess City,” and ate delicious Armenian food.

These elections are Bangladeshi equivalent of the US mid-term or state elections in Indian (and other federal) systems. If the elections are free and fair, they will provide an accurate gauge of the political state of play. Even if the government tries to rig the election, it will reveal a lot of things. If the Awami League can pull off a Bhola-style rigging across the country, then it wouldn’t have needed to rig anything because it would have been too strong to lose anyway. But overcooking the result will damage its credibility. And even it fails, any attempted rigging will show how capable the Election Commission, the media and the civil society is against a ruthless government.

Over the years the time trials become a big part of the early season events and most National events were held then in Sydney on the Nepean River. So it's been 17 years and many long distance events have come and gone. I guess for the most part I have faired well in them and yet go it to this one wondering what sort of day we will have. Things have changed to as this year we will be doing 2k racing after the 5k time trial. So in effect it been weird thinking through the different demands coming up.

Five days passed before I managed to attack the chicken. However I did not want to just simply reheat it in the microwave. So I drizzled some olive oil over the bird and I popped it in the oven for 15 minutes. I then stripped away the white meat (all while nibbling at the wings). I decided to shred it up and mix half of it with Sweet Baby Ray’s – the best BBQ sauce sold in grocery stores – garlic salt, pepper and rosemary.

acquire at the testimonials buyers ve their webpages and then judge just what everyone is saying the service that they can be administered. Also explore the returns policy and just what they certainly when items which often really do not open up to firmly the same quality levels. What many retailers really do not do is repayment cash flow on sale items, but this doesn’t mean that these kinds of items must not be of merchantable valuable. Indeed, even if they suppose that there is no way that one will exchange or repayment in such cases, they could be forced should the right language can be used.
School life ended for both my parents at the tender age of fourteen when both were sent out to work to support their families. My mother did not get to choose her career, she was taken out of school three days after the death of her father and sent off to learn to type, then courtesy of a friend of the family she was given a job in a typing pool. The money she earned was not hers it paid for household bills, fed and clothed her younger siblings. Being the eldest in the family thrust her, at an early age, into the role of chief breadwinner. Something I could never envisage doing to my eldest, with her dreams of veterinary school, nor is it something that we as a society would condone today. Children have earned an inalienable right to freedom, to a childhood and an adolescence that people of my parents generation could only have dreamed about. No wonder they find the youth today so arrogant, so confusing, they are in many respects a million light years away from my parent’s generation and they seem to my parents to lack grace and gratitude.

Several weeks ago, the first unexpected package came. It was a bundle of photos that our nephew had sent to us.

It struck me Saturday morning as I was driving the final hour into Royal Oak, Michigan that it was only about 10 miles from downtown Detroit. Unfortunately, I had a slight queasy moment in my stomach thinking what am I doing here. Detroit is known for a mass exodus of people that has been going on for years, and the stark contrast of the city against the skyline wasn't doing my thoughts of this place any favors.

It is good to know that I was right to be concerned about my back problems and that it wasn’t ‘all in my head’! When you have a mental illness it is very difficult to convince health professionals that a concern is real and not imagined. I remember when I had an anaphylactic shock the paramedics that came were quite happy to listen to me until they asked me what medication I took. On learning that it was Quetiapine for bipolar disorder they told me they were leaving.

I have written about related issues before: How hard do/should we as reviewers work to see the good (or excellence) in a proposal that has some technical flaws? In many cases, the flaws are in the writing, but in this case it wasn't so much how the sentences were constructed (each one by itself was fine), but in how the proposal as a whole was framed. If I had to work so hard to extract the interesting essence of the proposal, does that mean I will/should rate the proposal lower than I would if the proposal were technically excellent (in addition to containing interesting proposed work)?

If you stop at a bike station and it's full, you can score an extra 15 minutes at the kiosk to find another bike stand. ANOTHER NOTE: You're not being stealthy by riding for 30 minutes then doing a bike swap. The Vélib people want the bikes back so another person can use it for another 30 minutes. That's how they roll here in Paris. It's not all about making big bucks, people.

It doesn’t seem possible that that was my first experience of a toastie—I was well into my 30s at that point—but it was the first one that inspired me. Before I ate that sandwich, I had never made a grilled-cheese sandwich on the stovetop; never made a tuna melt; never combined anything with melted cheese between two slices of bread. Since I’ve had it, I would estimate that I’ve eaten at least one toastie a week without fail. Every week for the past six years. From a food perspective at least (and what perspective is more important?), I would define that as life-changing.

The movie is rather brutal. Filmed in 2000, Universal Pictures refused to release it because they thought it would get an NC-17. It rather reminds me of how you can make a mature PS2 or PS3 game, but none of the stores will sell it. (Or is it that Sony will refuse to publish it?) A rating is rather worthless if nobody is willing to release anything under it. Once again, we’re fucked by the goddamn children. Universal wasn’t particularly helpful in the filming either — the house is the same house as Best Little Whorehouse In Texas, so they insisted on running tour trams in and messing up the production. Real nice.

BTW, I thinkdistributed (“evenly spread throughout an area”) is a better description than the more commonly used virtual (“nearly real or simulated to be real”) for a company that has people working from all over the place instead of a centralized office. In Automattic’s case, we currently have over 50 employees spread across 12 US states and 10 countries.

Sure, we can all take a nice picture of the sunset, but how many of us can spot the angle that will sell a house in seconds? If you fear that your listing photos – or lack thereof – are hurting your sales numbers, you could be right. Here are three tips for taking good pictures to make your real estate listings move:

The legendary Divine is spectacular as the misguided Dawn Davenport, the world's most unfit mother. Playing an insolent teen and a grotesque freak in the same movie is one thing, but engaging in a sex scene with yourself on a dingy mattress on the side of the road has to be the pinnacle of high art. Oh, and call me slightly unhinged, but I think Divine has a timelessness about him. I mean, his face is quite appealing. Don't worry, when fantasizing, I try to imagine Divine's head in on Kirstie Alley's body circa 1991 ('92, if I'm feeling extra naughty).

I wrote Fly after some hard times with my father. A lot of what happened in the story were things we were going through. I can remember being surprised to realize when I was finished that tears had been running down my face while I was writing.
Okay, let’s go for the first Sulawesi culinary entry, Paria Kambu. It is a beloved traditional familiar dish of the people in South Sulawesi, particularly Makassar (the capital of South Sulawesi). Paria kambu is made from Paria/Pare (bittern melon/bitter gourd) stuffed with fish paste. The stuff’s main ingredient is from pan-toasted grated coconut flesh mixed with fish paste (usually made from fresh anchovy, but, shrimp is another best choice :D). The stuffed bitter gourd then is cooked in yummy-seasoned coconut milk base soup. The great stuff combination helps reducing the bitterness of the Paria. Paria Kambu goes really well even only with a plate of warm rice.
Not to be overlooked is how Americans react to the prospect of our presidential lineage going Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush Jr, Clinton II. My suspicion is: not favorably. (Thank God Jeb's not running in this election cycle or the country's collective head might just implode at the horror created by a Bush v. Clinton campaign.)
When I look back at my publishing journey, the most crucial factor for me in transitioning from a writer to an author was maintaining my persistence and belief in the face of frustration and rejection. Writing can be a solitary and disheartening profession, and the road to publication is hardly ever easy. Most writers admit to writing multiple novels, facing countless rejections, and confronting numerous personal demons before ever getting published. And it doesn’t stop there. Self doubt and fear of failure can be paralyzing to published authors as well. No one in her right mind would persist through it unless she truly loved the journey. In the end, it all comes down to having an unwavering passion to write.

This project reminded me of the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion…the annually commissioned architectural series every Summer in Kensington Gardens in London, UK. They examine and tackle very similar notions as regards the interplay of public spaces and the creative realm, again creating a flexible-use event space. This year Herzog & de Meuron and contemporary Chinese artist Ai Weiwei will create the twelfth commission, the world’s first and most ambitious architectural programme of its kind. I’ve just realised I will get to see this when I am back in the UK in June. Can’t wait. I love hanging out here in the Summer months. The Pavilion will take visitors beneath the Serpentine’s lawn to explore the hidden history of its previous Pavilions. Eleven columns characterising each past Pavilion and a twelfth column will support a floating platform roof 1.5 metres above ground. Taking an archaeological approach, the architects have created a design that will inspire visitors to look beneath the surface of the park as well as back in time across the ghosts of the earlier structures. You can see Ai Weiwei’s influence here…the need to reference the historical past of the project versus the contemporary perspective…there always has to be a past reminder as such. Where we have come from to where we are going to…
I could go on, but you get the idea. We had the Ray Stevens song on a 45 record when I was a kid. Yes, we played it often! LOL

McGovern adds context: "There's a lot of areas within this port that are not viable to support the maritime industry. Those areas everybody's more willing to give over to recreation, parkland, housing. Not a problem. There are certain areas that need to stay maritime-specific. Once it reverts to a different use, we will never get it back. The port will die. For instance, we have lost of one of our repair facilities to a box store. We have a backlog in this port, last I heard, of about two years on getting into the remaining repair facilities. That repair facility was greatly needed."

This happened last night. I’m very upset. In the past 24 hours I have: threatened to call the FBI to report Kelly as a “fucking commie,” and made plans for an OFFICIAL RCS STAR WARS PILGRIMAGE where I will take THE STAR WARS to Kelly’s house in Mississippi via the classic-pilgrim-transportation-vehicle: a Greyhound bus. I would go dressed in Jedi robes, but I’m afraid that Kelly would leave me at the bus stop.
Then the bankers claimed they were losing money on defaults when the loss was that of the investor lenders. To add insult to injury the bankers had used some of the investor lender money to buy insurance, credit default swaps and create other credit enhancements where they — not the investor lender —- were the beneficiary of a payoff based on the default of mortgages or an “event” in which the nonexistent pool had to be marked down in value. When did that markdown occur? Only when the wholly owned wholly controlled subsidiary of the investment banker said so, speaking as the ” master servicer.”

I have a great respect for the electoral process. In college, I tried to push all my roomates to go and vote. I don't really write too much about my feelings on candidates or policies.

I held the note trembling, knowing not what to do .
Today is a unique day. It is both my birthday and the anniversary of my dad's death. I turn 35 today and 16 years ago my dad passed away. Every birthday since then has been special. I celebrate my life as well as his. I can't help to wake up on my birthday and relive those last few days with him. It is my way of remembering the intensity of losing a parent. Though painful, I don't want to forget. I want to embrace the grief and loss I feel for him. The pain is real and it is a part of who I am. When I write about my dad, I can't always think clearly and I don't really want to. So, I just go with the flow and voice whatever comes to mind.
Accordingly, you can’t debate fascist thinking with reason nor empathetic imagination e.g., the self-righteous (and self-serving) pronouncements of mass media representatives nor the attendant outrage of the denizens of the corporate state in their audience — their umbrage engineered by the emotionally laden images with which they have been relentlessly pummeled and plied — because their responses will be borne of (conveniently) lazy generalizations, given impetus by fear-based animus.
So what are the arcane masters of the revenue proposing to do to recoup this massive amount we're notionally all depriving the Treasury of? Well let's take a look at the measures that would directly affect pubs (the list of proposals for brewers and wholesalers is a matter for them to consider, although any costs of compliance will undoubtedly be passed on to pubs).

One must obviously agree with White that the habits of mind and ways of feeling are prior and causative -- and I will say more about that below -- but I do not agree with White that the political policy-preferences they lead to are hard to define.
Arsene Wenger is one of several Premier League managers who are of the belief that simple adjustments are required in accordance with basic common sense, in order to improve the system and make it fairer for everyone. ”Basically we are in the position at the moment where if somebody takes a player’s leg off, if the referee has seen it and misjudged it, the player gets away with it. For me that is not acceptable,” Wenger told Arsenal Magazine.
# 3: Not using the product or service
During my first year of teaching, quite a few of my classes were boring. Can’t believe I just admitted that. The worst was my current events class. (I know a couple of students who would argue, not to say it was an exciting class, filled with the days most exciting news, but to say one of my other classes was worse.) I didn’t even enjoy listening to my students report on whatever big news story they’d found while scouring the web five minutes before class.

You can also do God’s will for God’s glory, but do it in a way that God never prescribes. It is certainly God’s will that the unborn are allowed to live, but when people start blowing up abortion clinics for the glory of God, obedience crumbles to pieces.
We also get reports of people who are hearing voices in their heads. What are these voices? Don’t discount the power, ability and plan of Satan to seek out those who are willing to hear.

This piece of amber contains a rarely-seen specimen of an assassin bug. Assassin bugs feed in a manner known as external digestion. They release a secretion that liquifies the tissues of their prey, after which they ingest this solution. The toxin acts rapidly and renders the prey powerless within a few seconds. While some assassin bugs actively seek out their prey, others lie in wait for it. The colors on this specimen’s wings have been well preserved.
I stumbled over an intriguing table the other day. Showing the hopping rates for British beer types in 1905. Rather than just reproduce the table by itself, I've also put together another of my own. Based on information from Whitbread's brewing records. You guessed it: compare and contrast time again.
Unfortunately, the venue was too dark for me to take photos that can be used here. You'll just have to use your imagination ...

So a parent has to earn the privilege of connecting with their children by coaching, and loving, and respecting, and believing, and inspiring, and motivating . . . but with a humility and grace that inspires confidence and trust, and earns credibility with their partner and their children. They have to recognize the fault in their expectation that a child should listen to and respect the parent because they are a parent, instead of because of what kind of parent they are. They must recognize and embody what every good leaders knows instinctively - that trust and credibility with your children must be earned, in every action and word.
The one friendship I regret losing now, Nancy was her name and she was beautiful, but nice. She loved flirting with guys and I loved hanging out with her cuz I knew all the hot guys were going to want to get to meet her ( and me by association). But one night of partying showed me her true colors, see she had just gotten married to this really hot, hot lead singer of a band ( we went to a lot of bars and met a lot of hot band members). I knew Terry ( her husband), and liked him, he was a nice guy and didn't need to have his wife going off to party with some other band for all hours of the night. I told her I wasn't interested in partying with this band, and we should get home, Nancy didn't like hearing that. She was about to go off with this band without me even though I had driven her to this bar ( somewhere near Marshall , Lind ballroom I believe), and I wasn't about to let that happen. So I finally get her away from the band and get her into my car to head the long drive back to Montevideo ( that is where we lived near). She was so mad at me she told me we were no longer friends, and she never wanted to speak to me again. I agreed, and the silent car ride has lengthened into 20+ years. I never made up with her again. I sometimes wonder though, how she is doing, we had many fun times before this together.
So let's figure that your random Thanksgiving flight on Wednesday will be 1) crammed full; and, if you are on a 757, home to 2 psychopaths and 4 sociopaths.
I picked her limp, screaming little body off the floor while trying to pin her arms and legs. I dodged her flailing limbs as I attempted to sit down without being kicked in the face. Meanwhile, Clay is walking around the desk and giving me a challenging look; a look that says he's going to push the envelope until I lose it. I'm thinking - it's no big deal that he's walking around the shop. He's just walking around. He isn't getting in anyone's way. No big deal. Lexi has other ideas though. She takes off after Clay to try to get him to sit down. This makes him squeal and take off in a makeshift game of tag. Ugh.
I always wondered if there was a name for a person like. He gave me the answer...It is Maven!!!
The tracker was deciding what to do. It seemed obvious that someone – perhaps their quarry – was holed up inside the maintenance shed. The door remained undisturbed but there were signs of dirt movement near the rear of the building. It seemed that there was the distinct possibility of a camouflaged entrance in the area where the dirt had been moved – perhaps a tunnel of some sort.
I don't want to, but it seems almost inevitable, really.

I wonder if I will ever get there. I wonder if I will ever be strong enough to look him in the eye and tell him how much he has hurt me. I wonder if I will ever be able to stand in front of him and say no. I wonder if I will ever be able to tell him he's a bully and unless he changes his behavior toward us he will no longer get to be with us.

The jail cell remained in use until 1925 as Kyle’s city jail and, later, was moved to the Texana Village at Aquarena Springs. Due to lack of funding, the jail cell along with other buildings and artifacts were removed from the Village. At the eleventh hour, the jail cell was saved and moved to its current location at the San Marcos Academy.

Our true culture and learning experience of the day came when we went to a field DLS facility operated and owned by a cooperative of widowed women (57 in total 10 are HIV positive). When we drove up to the facility the entire group met us with a cultural dance and chant. We soon found out that it is rare to have guest and the group wanted to extend the traditions of Rwanda to us, thus we were welcomed by a dance. We then traveled into the DLS facility and met with 30 of the cooperative members to discuss what they are doing and the plans they have for the group in the future. In order to join the group they pay 10,000 RWF ($16) membership fee. This fee paid for the building of the DLS facility. BAIR paid for the tin for the roof and transparent windows, as well as the netting which is quite expensive and hard to find. The netting is a must in order to keep out bugs and keep the quality of the potatoes. The chair had great pride in how the group had positively selected 10 varieties. These varieties are disease free and are helping improve yields. After our meeting, we broke out in traditional dance, except this time we joined. We may have showed them a few American moves; however they have the true skill of dancing.
We've heard this story time and time again from fanatics with mental health issues (do all fanatics not have some mental health issues?), but I can't help but wonder why their mental state seems to so often manifest itself in religious or social intolerance and violence. What is it about our society that causes crazy (I use this word for ease, but I don't like it, and don't think that it gives the complexity of mental health issues their proper dues) people to often be crazy in specific ways? Are these people genetically inclined to be terrorist religious fanatics? Bombing churches, mosques, Planned Parenthood centers, or military recruiting posts. It's all just very strange to me. I cannot understand what makes these people do what they do, and I probably never will, I just thought it was an interesting thing to think about why they do what they do - or more specifically why they are the way they are - instead of just calling them crazy or insane, or some other euphemistic word that doesn't really do justice to the range of mental health issues that they may be dealing with.

I got the idea for the first experiment from Pinterest! There are SO many great ideas to be found there! So I recreated this experiment to show children what fire needs in order to burn.

Without music blogs I would probably also have missed this- the Prins Thomas remix of The Grid's classic 1990 Floatation single, stretched out, zhizzed up and as dreamy as yesterday's Brian Eno remix.

Frank is a scientist and goes at this problem from a researcher's point of view while Paulette puts her head in the sand, selfishly acting as if Gwen's "condition" is a reflection on her. The strain on the McKotch family begins to tear at the fabric of the marriage and quite honestly, neither Frank nor Paulette is a very sympathetic character, but readers will hang in there for the kids, Gwen, older brother Billy and baby Scott, whose lives and conditions of their own are revealed in varying chapters.
Strange as it sounds, I'm very much a product of my home town - cynical, jaded, tired, suspicious, likely to splurge on a ridiculously tacky item just because Pop Star X wore it - despite the lack of time I've spent there in my life. I had, until this holiday, never been out in it. Why would I bother - as soon as you get off the plane, there's a disquiet in the air. I have an uncle who literally won't cross the road to go to the pub lest the baddies out there get him and steal his wallet. So there he sits, fearful, with a chicken madras and a can of Stella, waiting for death. I could slap him. People try and create a menace in Hobart - the nadir was the front page in the Mercury which suggested gangs were slapping random Syrup patrons, to which I sent in a reply letter suggesting that those patrons presumably were just angry when Syrup DJs decided once again it was Dave Dobbyn O'Clock. I even sent it in crazy old man writing to the paper green pen. No dice. I don't know that I like my home town that much. I mean, I do, but there's something quite disconsolate about Irvine. There's letters missing in the facade of the Maritime Museum, the leisure centre is frail and crumbling, far from it's glory days during which denim clad temptresses with 80s Sharleen Spiteri haircuts would turn down paramours without even saying a word and excitable kids would learn just how to turn a pit of plastic balls into a bullies paradise. I stood there for a while just sort of staring. It's hard to explain how I feel about Irvine - I think it's a bit like seeing your old girlfriends on Facebook, being excited to see them again, then finding they lack front teeth and spend all their posts randomly attacking nonsensical targets like E-Bay and Youtube all day long like old women at bus stops. You can't help but remember when that person was...fun. Attractive. The centre of your universe. You can't help but be pained that no matter what you do, there's an entire chapter, entire events, you simply can't place yourself in or around. Things are just...different. Of course, this is purely an example, and in no way a reflection of actual events. Oh no...

It’s not your father’s money. That is the short answer.
and then i glance across the room at my new closest companion
I am haunted by a passage in a little book, "The Badlands Fox," by Margaret Lemley Warren. She wrote about the adventures of her father, Pete, who ranched along the Cheyenne River at the end of the 19th century. He told her stories of the early days.
It appears that Levine is a fellow booklover, which is part of what makes this book pleasurable to read. Books by booklovers usually are. She speculates that "in many towns Barnes & Noble, with its upholstered armchairs, shiny mahogany tables, and endlessly replenished shelves, has become the new public library" (p, 97) with the exception "of course, that you have to buy something to use it, and these endless shelves contain only the books a marketing person considers saleable". Frankly, I fail to see the distinction. Barnes & Noble do allow you to browse without purchasing (you simply can't "borrow" outside the story - but you definitely don't need to buy to use their facilities), and a library too contains only "saleable" books - after all, a publisher won't publish it if it's not saleable, and a library won't buy it if it's unlikely to be in demand by borrowers. I don't know the situation in America, but in Australia, many so-called public libraries charge you for use. One in the suburb I used to live in had a joining fee. I refused, storming out rather pompously on the grounds that this was not a gymnasium. Upon discussing such matters with Neko-chan yesterday, I discovered that her local library charges patrons an outrageous $2.50 per item put on hold. Note that this is not for new books ordered in, but merely to reserve a book already in stock but borrowed out. Filthy! Of course, I do not blame libraries for this. It's plain to anyone that libraries are not flush with money, splashing around great wads of cash on marble bookshelves, gilt edging for the paperbacks, and flatscreen TVs advertising the latest acquisitions. Hell, most libraries I frequent now don't even have the money to cover their books, it seems. They simply don't receive adequate funding.

We've both got some machines that are visually striking, even beautiful, that are absoultely positively TERRIBLE at the job of TYPING. But, we can truly appreciate both their external beauty as well as their questionable engineering. So don't think that we necessarily believe that function is all there is to collecting. Looks play a big part too for us, even if we don't tend to mention it.
The best thing was that I discovered a new place in this state to love. (I'm proudly collecting those places like marbles in a jar since my heart expanded to fit Arizona about a year and a half ago.) True, I regretted we were not back hiking South Mountain at first, but then on the gentle winding trails in Usery Mountain Park, I found the true beauty of the Sonoran Desert with all its plant life diversity, and I knew South Mountain couldn't rival it. And I found a couple of famous individuals that I really associate with the West. Actually make that three....uh, four.
So we started our venture to Seneca, Missouri where Jason was going to be Project Superintendent over a new hotel and casino.

P.S. My son has not read a “Goosebumps” book yet. If I tell him this story, he may never read one. I’ll hold off a little longer. When I’m ready for waking up to screaming in the middle of the night, then I’ll encourage him to give one a chance. For now, I’ll enjoy my sleep.
I'd gone to Lou's in boy drag but had managed to find a place to park about 30 yards away on the main road. With my hair done I had to walk out of the salon and walk to the car. Two years ago I'd have never dreamed of walking to my car with my hair in such an obviously feminine style. What a difference time makes. I walked out of the salon door and turned to say goodbye to Lou who had come in on her day off especially to do my hair. I'd been nervous about making my way to the car but as I stood there in public talking to her any nerves simply evaporated.
According to IMDB, Special cost about $1 million to make and grossed $6,387 in the US. Normally, that would not be a good recommendation. What seems to have happened is that Special has been successful on the film festival circuit but not commercially. Admittedly a nightmare to market, it has slipped under the radar.

"Killgorey. This is the Cill-gabhra with which one, if not more than one, of our earliest Irish Saints was identified. The Martyrologies of Donegal and Tallaght, at June 24th, have 'Lon of Cill Gabhra.' In the List of the Bishops of Kildare, as given in the Red Book of the Earl of Kildare, two bishops are named as having preceded St. Conlaeth in that See, the first of whom was called Lony. As Cill Gabhra was in the immediate vicinity of Sletty, the learned author of Loca Patriciana considers that Lon or Lonius may be identified with Lonan, the son of Dubhtach the Druid, who, like his brother, was associated for a time with their cousin St. Fiacc. He thus would be one of the Four true Druids supposed to be referred to in the famous Bilingual Inscription at Killeen Cormac - (See Loca Patr. Pt. IV.) Again, at September the 3rd, the Mart. of Donegal records St. Lonn or Loman Coisfin, i.e. of the white leg, of Cill Gaghra, Mairghe. There is a curious story related of his refusal to lend his books to St. Columba; this is referred to in the scholium in the Martyrology: "It is said that the book-satchels of Erinn and the Gospels, and the Lesson Books of the students fell from their racks on the night of Lon-Garadh's death, so that no person should understand them as Longaradh used to understand them. A very ancient vellum book states that Lon-garadh, in his habits and life, was like to Augustine, who was very wise." The Feilire of Aengus, at 3rd Sept., has: "Longarad, a delightful sun." Upon which the gloss in the Leaghar Breac comments: i.e. in Sleib Mairghe, or in Mag Tuathat in Offaly. Longarad the Whitelegged, in Mag Tuathat in the north of Ossory, i.e. in Ui-Foirchellain, i.e. in Mag Garad in Disart Garad especially, and in Cell Gabra in Sliab Mairge in Les Longarad. Whitelegged, i.e. a great white hair through his legs. Or bright-white were his legs.
Instead of the futile attempts to try to control the future, I can successfully take control of my actions right now. I can choose to be my child's ally, his partner, his friend, rather than his adversary, his warden, or his circus trainer. I can look at the way I treat my child, and ask whether the things I am doing and saying are supporting the goal of building some kind of fancy superhero child or, rather, the goal of building a relationship with another human.
The Greek islands are focused on tourism. The Greek mainland is focused on EU subsidies.

Jamming guitars, bluesy pentatonic scales, songs of moral indignation: This can all seem like some surreal fun-house reflection of the American rock ‘n’ roll saga, only set among nomadic Muslims in the Sahara desert.

Somehow, with all the excitement of the unified patent court and the unitary patent system for Europe buzzing round his ears, this member of The SPC Blog team quite forgot that Case C‑518/10, Yeda Research and Development Company Ltd, Aventis Holdings Inc v Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, a reference for a preliminary ruling from the Court of Appeal (England and Wales), was still in the pipeline. This case has sped through the judicial corridors of Luxembourg, arriving in November 2010 and departing -- in the form of an Order -- on 25 November which was handed down this morning.

There is no doubt in my mind that writing can be taught. So a literary consultant will improve your writing. Whether they improve it to the point that agents and editors are forthcoming is never something on which I will pronounce, because the vagaries of the market are so unpredictable. But it most certainly ensures that decision-makers will see your work in its best possible state, and given how many immediate rejections are out there waiting for aspiring writers, this can only be a good thing.
Feedback appreciated - I have no time or opportunity to listen to it!
Also I have been crocheting lots of little Nana squares for my Springtime Throw by Nicki Trench. I now have about 380 little squares so I have decided to start crocheting them together rather than have hundreds of little squares lying around. It is so good to see it taking shape and I love the vintage look of this throw and the colours are so pretty. I still have a long way to go before it's finished but it's well on the way now.

The request by Roosevelt Landings Residents Association for Public Purpose Funds in the amount of $2800 to pay a previously incurred bill of a submetering consultant advising the residents in their dispute with Urban American landlord was rejected in a close vote after a lengthy discussion. The Roosevelt Landings Residents Association application was initially rejected by RIOC because they did not have 501 (c) (3) status which is a requirement for receiving Public Purpose Funds but a sponsoring 501 (c) (3) organization was later obtained, though after the deadline for applications. Will have more on this later.
The French lawyer mentioned a possible third commission, which arose because of the different mechanisms that enabled the submarines to operate. The Malaysian submarines had to be modified to operate in tropical waters, he said, which required altering the technical specifications. A variation order was made which incurred a further US$2.5 million. Breham concluded that the only doubt about the €114 million payment, which is reflected in Perimekar’s financial statements, was whether the payment was for valid reasons or unethical ones.

The duties of a release manager (RM) are diverse, it includes serving as a facilitator, gatekeeper, architect, support engineer, and overall as a coordinator. In these roles the RM will deal with software defects, issues, risks, change requests, feature requests, deployment and packaging, and community involvement. Sometimes these duties are liken to the practice of herding cats, however it's so far been my experience that most parties involved in Apache projects just want things to go smoothly towards each release.
am afraid to love. I am afraid to stay in this relationship, this union where there are no real guarantees. Marriage, in all of it's beauty and glory and promise, is so fragile and needy. As if any moment it could all fall apart and end tragically. It's risky to be so vulnerable. It feels foolish sometimes to keep trying and going when the odds seem so stacked against us. I guess at the end of the day, I still believe that we are worth fighting for. That we are made for each other. That he is the man I still want to do life with. That it's not just marriage I believe in - I believe in our marriage.
It is possible I am being somewhat harsh on you Mr Cameron. It is possible your education and professional life to date leaves you ill-equipped to absorb the realities of Islamic imperialism, but ignorance about a matter of such profound importance is not a legitimate defence. Perhaps you think the Islamic threat is blown out of all proportion by “right-wing extremists”, but the threat is more than real: it is overpoweringly the single biggest issue of not just our time, but of all time.

This is definitely a step towards a campaign to unite workers and migrants with many workers and youth participating in the demonstration alongside asylum seekers. Youth Fight for Jobs members participated in the demonstration and gave out leaflets for the March 13th anti-racist demonstration in Barking the leaflets went down really well and one member spoke from the platform explaining the importance of the demonstration to cut across the racist propaganda of the BNP and the main parties of trying to blame the economic crisis on migrants taking jobs and using public services. That we needed a campaign that will able to unite all working class people to fight for decent jobs and public services for all. This was well received by the demonstration.

When my eldest daughter was in the sixth form (6 years ago) she lost my large LV monogrammed purse after she decided to take it to school one day. She had gone to Sainsburys to buy doughnuts, came back to the common room, ate her treat, went back to class and left my purse on the table. Obviously we never saw that again. I was so distraught, I don't know how I didn't kill her. I had bought the purse myself a good few years beforehand and it was about £200 if I remember rightly, a lot of money for a purse back then . OH went out and bought me the purse pictured above which remains in excellent condition, as does the key purse which is now about 11 or 12 years old.

Great show from a reformed Pavement tonight in front of a sold-out crowd. So nice to see lots of people smiling and mouthing along with the words. Or shouting, cause you kinda have to yell "40 million daggers!" along with Bob. I haven't read interviews with the band stating the reasons for reuniting, but financial compensation and the urging of Matador upon their anniversary are likely high on the list. Whatever, I was just glad to bask again in the fun that is a Pavement show. I didn't end up sweating and exhausted at the front of the stage like I used to for Pavement shows at Liberty Lunch, but I did attend with the same guys as back then. So glad you could go with me E & M! Wonderful to see so many other friends as well.
Described as a cross between "rap, a concept album, and a horror movie" by Tom Chick (video game, not music, journalist), Eminem's second album finds him killing his ex-wife Kim and Dr. Dre (twice), raping his mother, exposing and condemning the anger and jealousy so many males feel in relationships, exploring the pathos of an obsessed fan, making light of the murder of Gianni Versace, singing a love song to drugs, and living out and simultaneously ridiculing the criminal fantasies of so many rappers. The best moments of any Eminem record are when he's blurring the lines between Slim Shady, Eminem, and Marshall Mathers, and never before or since have the lines been blurrier than here. Eminem's gift for, and love of, polysyllabic rhymes and incredibly complex rhythms mark him as one of the most technically brilliant rappers of our, and likely any, time, but it's the way the record delves into his deeply troubled psyche that makes it great.

Confession helps us keep track of who we still need to get the Gospel to; that would be those who haven’t confessed with their mouth the Lord Jesus, as we are on mission to get the Gospel to the nations. Christians also have a unique connection to each other called fellowship. And it is nice to know who each other are. So I hope I have covered essence thoroughly enough. The Church is the covenant people of God who gather in the name of Christ! But what is her purpose? Stay tuned for part three.
A little while ago I had one of the most satisfying Weight Watcher friendly meals I've had in a long time. I don't know if it was because it was so tasty or because I made it from absolute scratch but it was sooo good. Before you ask, yes, I made it from scratch...I even made the pasta.

Lewis didn’t give two pence about the many values of the modern world. He wasn’t much interested in career advancement. He continued working as a lowly tutor at Oxford for 20 years after writing the seminal book on medieval literature. Nor did he much care about money. Indeed, he lived on the same meager salary his entire life and gave away up to 90% of his annual income every year, including his considerable book royalties. What’s more, in his day-to-day routine Lewis walked most everywhere he went, he did all his writing by hand (his brother typed his book manuscripts) and he seldom strayed too far from his home in Oxford. Essentially, his life wasn’t that different from the life of an 18th century Oxford don. He lived a life largely untouched by modernity, at least in terms of his day-to-day habits.

There are days where bleary eyes and trembling hands consider such a thing. Because the tea leaves can only be spooned out so far. Dividing half by half by half is absurd in the light of abundance, but abundance doesn't last. It gets lost under a mounting wall of bills. The cheap and plentiful becomes costlier and scarcer not because it ceases to exist; it is because the sluicing effects of money diminish when that revenue stream dries up. The flood becomes a trickle. The trickle becomes elusive.
I deployed and the evil side got first turn since they were the ones ran by the game system.

Build your compost heap on bare ground, not on bricks or pavers. You want the worms and microbes to find and colonise the compost, so it needs to be on the soil. Site the heap close to the garden where it will be used and if you have dogs or chickens, it will need to be fenced off or else they will eat what you put in there. If you live in an extreme climate, it might be best if you shelter the heap up against a wall. This will also provide a solid border to one side of the heap.

Anyhoo, back to the cards. This week we played with this little critter from Woodware. She is stamped 3 times and layered up. The tulips are made from the wings.

They are coloured with pro-markers and the background is stamped with rosebud Memento. Some of the ladies wanted instructions for making the diamond top folded card. I will post these later when I work out best how to explain it!
Another thing Breivik shares with the multicultural lobby is a powerful sense of cultural paranoia. He believes “my culture” is under siege. Only where mainstream multiculturalists tend to argue that minority cultures such as the Islamic one are threatened by tidal waves of Islamophobia and general public ignorance, Breivik says the majority culture – the white Christian identity – is threatened by the “Islamic colonisation” of Europe and also by general public ignorance (he says ordinary people have been led astray by the media). These are just different versions of the same sense of cultural panic that is fostered by the multicultural outlook. Indeed, it is remarkable how much Breivik has in common with those Islamists he despises. Where Islamists, also under the influence of multiculturalism, crazily claim that their cultural identity is threatened by “New Crusades” against Islam, Breivik says his cultural identity is threatened by crusades from the East, by “Islamisation”. Both groups of people have been made entirely paranoid by being encouraged to become obsessed with their allegedly fragile identities.

So, back to my original question - why do we love highwaymen so much? I can't think it was any fun being held up at gunpoint and being forced to hand over your valuables.

Yes, that was not a typo. I saw a baby – a freaking infant of about eight months old – swiftly swim right past me towards shore. What is this, lamaze?! In that dream, I actually almost drowned in shock at the sight but, thankfully, I was able to wake up. So weird to die in a nightmare of seeing an eight month old baby singlehandedly swim in a deep blue ocean… and him/her not even bothering to help drowning adult moi. I have no idea where that baby came from… hopefully not from me!

He describes the setting, Ierland, and how he is a criminal
After sacking the city of Troy, Agamemnon took his loot, which included the priestess Cassandra who warned him of his murder by his wife, but because of a curse that Apollo had given her, no one ever believed her prophecies. So after a stormy voyage (wow that's incredibly cliched) Agamemnon finally returned to his kingdom of Mycenae (A place which I was supposed to see last summer in my Odyssey of my graduation vacation, but the unfortunate political upheaval of Greece made our cruise go to Santorini instead) Getting back on topic, it turned out that while the king was gone, Clytemnestra had been sleeping with another man. This man was Aegisthus and he was the cousin of Agamemnon and the son of Thyestes. His story is a tale of incest and cannibalism (so best leave that for another blog) So with the wife of the king by his side, Aegisthus decided to send out spies to report to him the return of the king, thus he would not be surprised if Agamemnon did return. When the king did return, the shrewd Aegisthus planned his hostile takeover of the crown.

So in all this activities it’s really hard to find out the time you spent in interacting with real people (Outside your virtual world). As per my personal experience, Social interaction is good, it’s a platform where I have really enjoyed sharing news, blogs and personal opinion which ofcourse I might have not done when I met someone in real. I like to utilize social media to engage in social interactions, it’s just an alternative.

You damn freakazoid muffdiving dyke. Why on earth would you want to rub your pussy against another pussy instead of letting me put my cock in your pussy and exchanging ultimate pleasure, then when I cum in your pussy we can have a baby together. What is your problem? You dont like me as your man? You are a disgrace to the human species. Why dont you go commit suicide you damn cunt. Who in the hell in their right mind would hunt tuna???
One of the few black-tailed prairie dog colonies is also in the refuge. There's one in Lawton, too, after the townsfolk gave up eradicating them from their parks. It seems to me the plow did a good enough job of that in the Plains.
During my initial review of mitochondrial anatomy and physiology, it became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the mitochondrial DNA is not highly conserved. In the past my elementary understanding and interpretation of mtDNA, led me to believe that due to the much smaller size of the mitochondrial genome, relative to the mammalian nuclear genome, the mutation frequency in mtDNA, by logic would be significantly less frequent, relative to mutation frequencies in nuclear DNA. However, my further study of the mitochondrial genome unveiled that it contains few, if any, noncoding DNA sequences (three percent), whereas 93% of the nuclear genome is noncoding DNA (Taylor & Turnbull, 2005). This newly established understanding, paved the way for a more comprehensive and scientifically logical understanding, for the higher frequency mutation rate in mtDNA (about 100-fold higher than that of the nuclear genome) (Taylor & Turnbull, 2005).

Since I first heard about (and subscribed to) Birchbox last year, there's been a flurry of new beauty boxes continuously appearing on the market: MyGlam, Beauty Army, and even GlossyBox is soon to be launched in the US! To be completely honest, I was a bit disillusioned about beauty boxes after my experience with Birchbox (but of course now after a spell of bad boxes they're back on top of their game), so I wasn't really looking for a new subscription. However, when I heard that Beauty Bar was launching a new sample scheme in cooperation with Allure, I thought it sounded promising and signed up for the service. The first Sample Society box just landed on my door step last Wednesday, and here are the products I received together with my initial impressions.
This Monday evening (Dec 6) at Crosby Ravensworth Village Hall, Crosby Ravensworth Parish Council heard a brief presentation on Community broadband, what it is, why it would be useful and how we could get it established. Though many were still unclear about how much they’d benefit personally, the pertinent observation that this was a decision with long term implications and that other Parishioners and generations of Parishioners might benefit more than those in attendance was persuasive. I would like to praise and thank our Parish Council for their wise decision. This is an important landmark event because our Parish council has ‘clout’ and can help encourage cooperation, negotiate wayleaves and grant permission to dig on Parish land and to erect poles if necessary.
About 4 and 1/2 years ago, Marty and I were living in San Diego, CA. We were stationed there, while Marty served in the US Navy. My Dad was living with us, at the time. I got sick. Not just a little sick, like wretchedly ill, I just want God to take me NOW, kind of sick. I thought, I had a stomach virus, but a couple of days in and no one else in the house was sick. I had a fever, headache, chills, stomach "issues," etc. I literally laid on the couch for days (thank God my Dad was with us to take care of Eli and Julie). I was officially out of commission. There was a long series of events that led to me being seen at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego. We had to fight with the insurance to get me in, because I was supposed to be seen by a civilian doctor, but couldn't get in anywhere. Turns out I had a severe case of pneumonia. Doctor's wanted to hospitalize me. I said, "No, just give me something strong and send me home." I had suffered at home for days, anyways. Went home got better, life moved on.

A nightmarish haze hangs on his heart, on his hair, all over his aching body. It clings to him, dirtying him. He feels filthy, profaned, like his mind is being sullied somehow by this invasive presence. It seeps into him, into his self, and shakes him to his heart, to the core of his soul. He can feel it eating away at him.
4. Neurobiology Defined: Neurobiology is the study of cells of the nervous system and the organization of these cells into functional circuits that process information and mediate behavior. It is a sub-discipline of both biology and neuroscience. Neurobiology differs from neuroscience, a much broader field that is concerned with any scientific study of the nervous system. Neurons are cells that are specialized to receive, propagate, and transmit electrochemical impulses. In the human brain alone, there are over a hundred billion neurons.

The sunroom is approximately 10 x 25 and wrapped in windows on three sides. The remaining side is filled with French doors that lead to my living room. It is always bright, even on Oregon's grayest days and a great place to read or sip coffee in the morning. We also use it as an office and have located the computer in this space. It is filled with an eclectic mix of old and new pieces. The pullout couch is a newer piece along with a few lamps. The bookshelf is an antique hand me down from my mother. The desk is an estate sale find. The wicker chair was picked up at a garage sale. The coffee table is Austrian pine and is full of dings and random nails added over it's many years. The chair at the desk comes from my grandfather's tavern and makes me think of him. Scattered throughout the room and used to hold papers and pens is my collection of 40's pottery. It's a great example of mixing new and old things to create a livable space.

on the same day, my uncle passed away unrelated to the storm and a couple hundred miles away. it was expected, he was 86. sitting at the funeral yesterday, we laughed and we cried. his daughters spoke of his values and his life - memories flooded over me of time spent at their house in the summer. i will say, the playing of taps on the bugle and the flag presentation ceremony shook me to tears. my uncle fought in ww2 and the flag was presented to his son who fought in vietnam.

Remarkable freshness and a fully-functioning moral compass are all very well, but I think I'd be just a little disappointed if all beers tried this hard to be this well behaved.

Kale is one of the vegetable greens that have done really well in our garden. Kale is often referred to as a superfood. Loaded with vitamins and anti-oxidants. I was not sure initially what my reaction to kale would be, but I have been surprised at its mild flavor. Fresh kale takes very little effort to make it delicious. A little pepper, salt and garlic sauteed in olive oil....well you can decide for yourself. If you have read my previous garden post on Kohlrabi http://bit.ly/u1cXmW by God, if it grows well, it will be planted! Which means I have plenty of kale in the garden too.
Maybe if the weather clears a little tomorrow we can try some sledding and snowman building. And if the weather doesn't clear, we can all invest in snowsuits and do it anyway!
There is lots to like about The Cold Dish. The characterization, sense of place and prose are all excellent. Johnson places the reader into Absaroka County and its colourful and complex characters, its social relations, local politics, and myths and legends. All of the principle characters are very well drawn and there’s a good, even balance of strong male and female leads. The landscape is a character in itself, fully fleshed out and realised, and used to good effect. Johnson draws on his own long law enforcement career to detail the nuances of police procedure and cop dynamics and personalities. For the most part the plotting is very good, with the story unfolding at a nice pace, progressively becoming more complex and layered. Several plausible characters are all viable suspects, keeping the reader on their toes. However, in the last fifth of the book, the story becomes a little overly melodramatic and the resolution felt contrived to create a twist for the reader and just didn’t feel ‘right’ - difficult to discuss without spoilers, but it undermined what had been until then a really excellent read. Nevertheless, this is superior fare and well worth a read. I’m looking forward to reading the second book in the series - Death Without Company.
And, I read Cath's article on PC blog about focus on trendy spectacle. I loved the card by Chunyaun with the repetitive pattern of the spectacle. So inspired by all of these, I made my card.

Of course a film played entirely at that level could well be unbearable. Think Funny Games but without the comforting distance of being an intellectual exercise. And it certainly wouldn't have sold enough popcorn to guarantee a fourth installment. But I can't help but watch this sequence with the mixture of terror and pity it arouses in me and wonder what might have been had Craven and Williamson had the balls to follow through on the courage of their convictions.

For years I tried to give a voice to my pain. I tried to pull a muse forth. For surely, such a wealth of living, such a windfall of pain, must come with a voice? I forced a few poems, but they lacked the magic, the power of a muse inspired poem. Quite simply, they were not good. I don’t know if I even kept them. If I did, they are buried in some old notebook or some abandoned stack of papers somewhere.

What I would like to know from you is, is it bad protocol to start feeling out the waters with other agents (querying) while still under contract? I don't want to do anything unethical or something that would tarnish my reputation as a new author, however I also would like to have an agent that is doing their job asap. And if it is okay to start querying while under contract, do I mention that I am under contract and looking for a more suitable agent?

The interesting part comes now: one of the inventors has filed a third-party observation (labelled "amicus curiae brief" - which sounds somewhat overblown for us germans) arguing that the whole procedure was a hocus-pocus arranged to deprive him of his financial compensation as an employee-inventor.

The West has had a decent run at trying to capture exactly what it’s like to take on the undead, most notably with Left 4 Dead and Dead Island. The former, developed by Half-Life team Valve, is a team-based first-person shooter which features up to four players working together to mow down reams and reams of zombies and reach the end of a handful of long-length levels. An artificial intelligence engine called “the Director” monitors how well players are performing and ups or lowers the difficulty depending on how well they do – one of the game’s best features. However, a lot of the zombies aren’t really conventional. There’s acid-vomiting ones, screaming ones and huge hulks which stand damn-near invincible – and the normal ones don’t even shamble. They just run like insane berks. It turns typical zombie terror into an adrenaline rush, so it isn’t quite right.
Oh, but when the Eastern District newsboys found this out the following day! On March 29th, according to a report by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, a hundred newsboys, armed with sticks and stones, stormed the Times distribution offices at South Eighth Street and tried to prevent two wagons of newspapers from heading to the Western District. A whip-wielding wagon driver and arriving police officers thwarted the boys, but one of the trucks was later overturned at the area around today's Brooklyn Navy Yard.

NCAA action indoors has been exciting to say the least. Oregon's Galen Rupp has silenced his critics as he has dominated his races. The big 3 (Fernandez, Derrick and Puskedra) Freshman have more than lived up to the hype. German has a 3:55 mile to his name already and Chris Derrick was a 2-time All-American at NCAA Indoor. Months into his Freshman year and Chris has 3 (including XC) All-American certificates to his name. It will be very interesting to see how these 3 perform for the US Junior team at the world XC meet in Jordan.
But while new hockey arenas escape ridicule in the Alberta election campaign, the notion of a new museum for the province meets disdain, ESPECIALLY if tax dollars are going to support it. Sure, a new arena gives some a sense of community. But for others, the opportunities and advantages a new museum offers does the same thing. Why should one be so vital and the other dismissed as needless? The museum is attacked for being high-brow, when it’s accessible to everyone across the age and social spectrum. And they won’t just sit in a seat, they’ll participate. The social, cultural, and educational opportunities the museum offers more than just a $300 cheque you can spend on a round of Jägerbombs for your friends with new haircuts.

People who have a genome infection may notice that their system settings have been changed. The virus may add Windows registry entries that cause the computer become more vulnerable to other types of infection as well. This particular virus is a terrific example of how Trojan viruses and malware do their work. People’s computers regularly become infected with these kinds of Trojan enemies. It is nearly impossible to anticipate where or how a virus or piece of malware might be lurking which is why it’s so important for computer users to download anti-virus and anti-malware to keep their computer’s secure from most forms of attack. Though anti-virus and anti-malware can’t protect you from every threat that you might encounter online, it can help you keep your computer safe from most threats of infection. There are plenty of viruses and malware out there that can cause you a lot of grief if you don’t have the proper security measures in place.

On Monday, I had my first class. We started off with a meeting at 9am, to introduce us to the school and how things were gunna work 'round here. I had been woken at 6am by an incredibly intense dream, in which I lied to the police, my Mutti was panicking with me trying to hide me in the house. In the distance, I could hear the sirens, and suddenly, I was stung on the hand by an enormous wasp, and woke up feeling a serious pain in my palm. Turns out the siren was an actual ambulance going past in the street, and the wasp fantasy was just the fact that the motorbikes rushing past have that whiny insect sound. Nevertheless, I was awake, so I got up. Shoved some breakfast down my face, and headed out in good time.

Banaian said, on debt, “The debt is created in part for families and for students by the fact that we can only pay our debts after we pay our taxes. I believe that you have to reduce the size of the government. Right now, government spending is growing faster than population plus inflation. We need to have our government grow at the rate the state grows. The other thing we have to talk about is the debt load that students take. Students probably have debt when they’re leaving college and on top of that we have the federal and state debt for which they’re party responsible. I want to have a Government which spends responsibly and a more flexible student loan system. I want a housing market that does not encourage people to take on loans when they’re not ready.”

For me, adequate sleep is not a mater of staying healthy. It is a matter of staying in the ministry. It is irrational that my future should look bleaker when I get four or five hours sleep several nights in a row. But that is irrelevant. Those are the facts.

“For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew Him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning Him. And though they found no cause of death in Him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took Him down from the tree, and laid Him in a sepulcher. But God raised Him from the dead…” – Acts 13:27-30

If it’s younger kids, maybe take them to the local library or something…
The fact is both political tribes are wrong, in different ways on more or less everything. This is extremely worrying. The Democrats think the Bush-era tax-cuts are to blame for everything. Republicans want to blame everything on discretionary spending. The Republicans won't touch the bloated American Military, the Democrats won't touch Entitlements. Both sides are getting what they want and the result is an almost Brownian deficit, as both sides are talking to themselves. Neither side is interested in the rest of the world.
It is important to separate fact gathering and feedback from strategy development from full-scale strategic planning (or road mapping). These are three separate and distinct activities. Fact gathering and feedback puts you in touch with customers and into listening mode; strategy development involves developing a core functionality enveloped in the larger business plan of the firm, and road mapping is more analytical as you outline the details of how to deploy strategy on a day-to-day or monthly basis.
Daydreaming has superseded living life, and I fear (hope?) that I'm becoming a spirit only half inhabiting my own world as my edges fade and an exchange is made: my form takes on substance in that other place, the one that exists only in my mind and on paper. Could that really be? Do people still see me, or am I truly becoming indistinct, haunting the edges of real life? The peripheries of the solid world? Am I becoming a ghost? Do they even notice that the woman at her chores and errands is fading into a blur, a smudge, a transparent wraith?
And while I don't intend to make this a New Year's resolution (I just don't like the label) I do intend to follow through with this book and see if I can finally achieve what I so desperately crave, a clean organized home and a zen like life.
Arise, My love.
Selebi and McBride are both appealing.

That’s “write” – I’ve filled it all the way up! I set a goal of 250 words per day when I made my New Year’s resolution, and that came to 91,500 words (366 days x 250 = 91,500 … gotta love leap year). 250 words may not seem like a lot, and it’s not, but it’s a very achievable goal that keeps me moving forward, in large part because it’s so easy to reach. Success encourages persistence, after all (you can read a more detailed explanation of my reasons here).
Yup, you can always count on the Vatican…for a good scandal.
However, spamming my site over 30 times in two days is not going to get you the desired results.
Best escorts provider Indian escorts agency possess some distinctive features and the way
International gangsterism goes hand-in-hand with economic and political criminality at home. Aggression abroad is inseparable from the merciless assault on the living standards and basic rights of broad masses of working people in Europe, America and virtually every major country. While workers are everywhere being told that there is no money to pay for jobs, education, health care, pensions or vital social services, billions are expended to bomb and invade Libya with no questions asked.
We finally went to sleep at around 5.15am (after nearly 48hrs of being awake) but I had to get up at 8am as I had a work meeting. Most of Wednesday is a bit of a blur as I was so tired, but definitely worth it to see all those beautiful puppies being brought into the world!
With HOURS of time to kill, I went back to my room and watched some Death Proof (but actually stopped before the best parts because I have this habit of picking up accents and didn’t want to pick up Zoe Bell’s accent in advance of meeting her...)
As Cory’s feelings for her grow and winter becomes spring, will he be able to accept her as she is now and truly forget and forgive her sordid past?
While at the police station between 1am and 4am Sunday-morning, he also saw another ‘suspect’ assaulted by between six to 8 police officers who even threw the man against a wall. Van der Merwe was enroute from Ventersburg to Hennenman on a rural road at Sundaymorning 1am to visit friends when he was pulled over by cops in a ‘blue light’ vehicle. Two black officers jumped out and accused him of ‘being drunk’. They searched him and his entire bakkie and then threw him — without any kind of explanations – in the back of the police van: one officer drove him to the police station, the second one followed in the bakkie belonging to the young man’s grandmother, and which he was allowed to drive. He asked to call someone from the police station but they refused.
Well, hope you're having fun. I'm off to go and jump up on the kitchen table so I can see out the window and watch for intruders who come up to the front door. Perp has told me this is bad but how else does she expect me to guard the house?
Both Wyatt and Maxfield now take showers instead of baths. I am not sure if I should introduce the old prank of sneaking into the bathroom and dumping ice cold water into the shower. I think it would be funny but then I think about my cousin Frankie.

This cheesecake was delicious. The orange was subtle, but enough to give it a floral smell. It was creamy for ricotta and not too sweet. The graham cracker crust turned soggy, but perhaps that came from not draining the ricotta for at least eight hours (more like two or three).
Now, I know you have always wanted to know exactly what we eat at our house. Here is your chance. :)

I'm tired of guessing what others are thinking, of analyzing, or trying to figure out if there is a place for me in your life. I don't want to chase anymore, I'm tired of running, I'm tired of trying.
An incarnational analogy (in this unique human expression there is a uniquely divine expression), a methodological atheism (this text only means whatever the human author intended it to mean) and a post-modern reading (this text is entirely open to the reader’s determination) are equally problematic. How can we hold historical realism and theological vision together in a way that gives “verbum dei” more than an optimistically imaginative and fideist reality?
Probably not.
It happens to me all the time. Only a few minutes, I tell myself. Then hours later I suddenly remember I have things to do, and places to go. No doubt internet chat and community sites can become very addictive. It comes and goes, in my case. For a long time I didn’t bother with it much but now I am back to being hooked on the sites, endlessly it seems. Only problem is that other things like sleeping and eating and such suffers. Taking care of the home also suffers, not to mention other things connected to the life offline. But I know it is better to have some communication online than none offline, and the same goes for friends. So I am there.

God soon responded to his prayers and generous disposition leading Benjamin not only to convert to the Catholic Church but also to follow Him and to begin his journey towards the priesthood. Benjamin’s time in the seminary has been rewarding and has reaffirmed God’s will for him.
I've discovered a program that will assist those in this category, however it is proving very difficult to find the right information from an individual who is willing to divulge it and I feel so sorry for anyone trying to do this without the resources I have available to me.

I have five of these plates I bought for $4 each from my paint instructor. My intent was to have them painted in time for Christmas, hand write the recipe on the plate, bake the recipe, and give it all, goodies and plate, as a gift. Unfortunately, I did not have time to paint poinsettias and leaves around the edge of 5 plates before Christmas came and passed. But now I have all year. And I've already completed 3 plate (2 are shown below):

With three suicide attempts, a brain tumor, depression, anxiety and all that fun shit, Jesus has worked with me personally to "weed out my garden". And what do I mean by that? Well, I mean JUST THAT. He helps me recognize the weeds in my life and He also does the weeding for me. He works in miraculous ways, I must say. So, with all those issues in my life, I have lost friends or given up on friends who just didn't support me or our friendship. As sad as it can be, heart wrenching at times, I just have to look at it with an attitude of "it just wasn't meant to be".
After six months at home, I recently made the decision to return to the workforce. It was a very tough decision, and has been a ridiculously hard transition. There's a big part of me that simply misses being home every day, the tug and pull of a family living in freedom and bouncing around from activity to activity. But there's another part that is sad, angry and ashamed that I did not do more to ensure that I could have stayed home for longer - or maybe forever. I should have written more, I should have explored more options, I should have had a better plan, I should have networked. It's water under the bridge, but it still hurts.
He said that although the official trade from South Africa was legal, it would stimulate an illegal market for lion bones and derivatives that would affect wild carnivores in all African range states.

And another. This has also been quilted with gold thread so it looks much more sparkly in real life! On the flower designs at the bottom of this panel Mum has added little Japanese coins in the middle, I think they look great.
I went to the weekly market in Alhaurin last Thursday with my friend Caroline. She told me about the amazing Frutos Secos stand there. They sell all sorts of dried fruits, nuts, seeds and herbs for reasonable prices. I wanted to get some dried figs for this pizza and needed some more pine nuts for our weekly favourite, this recipe. I couldn’t resist taking a picture of these beautiful fresh garlic on the veg stall next door too.

I was attracted to this book as I am all books about books. However, I quickly found that Tolstoy and the Purple Chair is not a book about books but rather a book about loss and grief and the difficulties in overcoming them. Sankovitch shares her journey towards living with her loss. She reflects on the memories resurrected by the books she reads and comes to realize the best way to carry on is to value the life her sister led rather than focusing on the tragedy of her death. There are, of course, discussions of some of the books she read, but more important are the lessons the books teach her.
The process we saw in the popular uprisings in the streets during the African Spring that spread into the Arab Spring and into resistance movements across Europe in the summer, that finally jumped across the Atlantic into the American Fall weren’t concerned with what political apparatus was going to replace the current systems of oppression, as they were concerned with just doing away with the systems of oppression altogether. This is a matter of renewed faith in imagination and a collective rebirth of humanity. The old arguments between Marxism or Leninism or Libertarianism or Anarchism didn’t go away they were just set aside while we went about the business of getting rid of the common enemy. No matter what the differences of direction to take in the future, the common enemy had to be dealt with in the present.

Her mother should never know what happened between her and her husband to not worry her and to not shred the curtain of privacy of her conjugal life .What happened behind doors had to remain behind doors.She went to her old room. Everything was as she left it.Her mother did not forget to water her lavender that were sprinkling grains of beauty in her room corners and soothing her loneliness.

April 29
With the combination of warm weather and relatively late sunrise times (6:30 ish), I really had no excuse not to set the alarm early and head out to Ocean Drive to watch the sunrise. Acadia National park is one of the first places on the east coast to experience sunrise, and the fact that I saw not one other person in over an hour really made me feel like the sunrise was all mine.
*The Japanese people are amazing! They have been dignified, sensible, and cool-headed throughout this. Take note, Americans! (Myself included.)
Chipotle is a great company, so where will the drop end? I see a floor around $360-$370. After that it will be interesting to see where growth will come from. People travel specifically to Chipotle, and anyone who has been to one during lunch on a weekday will know they are not hurting for customers. The market is far from saturated with only 1,257 stores, but the market does seem to be satisfied. Stores now enjoy about $2M a year each in revenue, and new stores will undoubtedly eat into this. I do not see major growth coming any time soon from ShopHouse, their Washington, DC only store serving Southeast Asian food. Thai and Vietnamese cuisine is still fairly exotic to the American dining public and it is going to take time to scale the concept.
I found out on this particular run that from my house to Lonehill boulevard is only 4km’s “ish” – also found a rad back route that is going to annihilate any traffic problems I may ever experience getting to Lonehill ever again.
The problem now is that I have a bitter ale recipe with a blended Belgian/English yeast. What to call it? As I generally eschew style nerdiness and meticulous adherence to the BJCP, I am going to call it a Belgian Bitter. It will be named "Bob's Yer Uncle", not only because it came to me the other day out of the blue, but because the alliteration of "Bob's Yer Uncle Belgian Bitter" rolls off the tongue nicely and creates the anticipation of many days working behind the bar talking about it. Casking up day is tomorrow, and I hope to have it on the pumps a little over a week later. See you at the pub.
It is a sobering thought that more than 20,000 children under the age of 11 were put on record by their teachers (and one can only use this term in its loosest sense in this context) in 2010 for the kind of 'hate-crimes' as the one allegedly committed by the young boy in Hull when he asked an innocent question.
I see her trying to imitate so many things I do. It’s cute and rather scary. Abigail has picked up on so many idiosyncrasies that I didn’t know she was seeing. I would notice a behavior in her and wonder where it came from, until I caught myself in the act and realized she was copying me. It’s only been innocent little things, like the way I point or say “no, no, no!”, for example. But what else am I doing? What else will she see? Are there actions, manners of speaking, ways of relating that I don’t want her to copy?

Mopane worms are the larvae of the Emperor Moth – a giant velvety moth that bats against the windows in the evenings of early summer. It comes in shades of pinks and browns – old rose colours – and has two enormous false eyes on its wings. The moths live for four or five days – long enough to produce a batch of eggs. The eggs become mopane worms who feed voraciously and then burrow underground to pupate through winter.
We finally got to our hotel at around 1:30 am. Our taxi ride directly to the hotel proved amazing, all except the part where we sat in the car for 15 minutes while our driver argued with the airport taxi attendant, in who knows what language. Scary. Our hotel was perfectly located in Times Square, a little (well, huge) 4-star gem I stumbled upon on a 24 hour 1/2 off sale on Priceline. Let me be perfectly honest, that was the ONLY way we afforded a trip to NYC! The best part about the hotel was that instead of being 100 sq feet like most hotels in the area, it was 3 times the size and promised a bathroom that could fit a crib. I was sold.
I actually found it to be really different, compared to the more usual type of high school stories that I've read in the past. Having been part of the adventure of raising two teenagers in my own life, I have great affection for teens, and enjoy reading about them. I have also maintained my taste in young adult literature, and this young adult book was a really excellent read!
I look at my favourite mug, and I see wabi sabi. It is chipped and cracked and the logo is peeling off, but it is that way because I have used it so many times. It is the favourite pair of jeans that will someday fall into rags. The flower that lost a petal in a strong wind. It is the lines on your face. The crooked tooth. The grey streak in your hair.
This is M11 Rickshaw. It went together amazingly well by strip piecing it. Granted it is ever so slightly different than Jane’s original as the points of the sideways and regular diamonds don’t match exactly. The angles on my diamonds are just slightly larger. But it’s close enough for me, and this was just easier. Here’s what I did.

Rather than elaborate hoaxes hatched in underground lairs and supported by convoys of black vans, a minute number of people in power, for intents both altruistic and craven, do steer the course of events via subtle, covert nudges. ‘Spark’ moments need not be created out of whole cloth, merely facilitated, or at the very least, exploited with vigor when they fortuitously occur. Just a few examples of “nudges” of serendipitous turning points that dramatically changed the course of History:
Now I just need to play catch-up and start this with the other kids. Another variation of this I've see that is cute, is asking your kiddos the same questions at the beginning of each school year and putting their answers on a picture, and then put them all together in a scrapbook for graduation - how cute, and easy!

Was asked to do an article for the American Association of Suicidology (AAS) on what it was like to lose someone to suicide. I gladly accepted as I feel it’s so important to get personal stories out so people can better understand what it is like for those left behind, we’re known as survivors.

I had been looking at some online CEU courses, through my professional organization's website, but most of them were expensive, and I'd blown my budget on those unaccredited courses (which I loved).

Wagner said, “Some people are arguing that people will make a choice based on how much it costs to go to school. They will not choose to become teachers, they will not choose to become artists because they will starve for a while. Why go to criminal justice to become a cop, when you’re only going to get $30,000 per year, when you can become a civil engineer?”

I was darn near late getting back from my lunch break on Friday - I was listening to a great report on CBC radio about technology and 'unplugging'. (The interview is here - it starts at about 14:00) Fascinating stuff. There have been studies done that say that when you read a computer screen, if there is a block of text (much less a picture) that doesn't have anything to do with your reading, it shoots your comprehension of what you do read by 50%.

Yet these men are little to be blamed, for perhaps they go astray while seeking God and desiring to find him; for as they live among His works they keep searching, and they trust in what they see, because the things that are seen are beautiful? Yet again, not even they are to be excused; for if they had the power to know so much that they could investigate the world, how did they fail to find sooner the Lord of these things?

The rules are simple.
Until a teacher told me I ought to hire someone to title my stories, I didn’t think I was particularly good or bad at it, but after that comment, my titles got significantly worse. Perhaps even more than the story itself, a great title requires an extraordinary amount of confidence and even bravado, especially if you’re going to go the straightforward route (Death in Venice) rather than the ironic (A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius). If anyone were to ridicule the latter, Dave Eggers could simply laugh it off, but a critic could drive a sword straight through the soft spot that is the fact that Thomas Mann’s title would also work beautifully for a paperback crime novel. If some cynical or silly or simply cruel little snit chose to ridicule the title of Eggers’ magnificent and soulful What is the What, with a snide reference to Dr. Seuss or even to that high school cheer I like so much, Eggers would not be able to simply snigger back at his not-so-hip detractor, but would have to somberly explain himself.

The maze of reflected glimmers dazzled, too complex for the eye to pick out patterns, even with the benefit of Clearsight. Dimly, Rel could sense the ceiling of the Sherim above him, a squashed dome rendered vast by the intricacy of everything within it. Dora, ahead, seemed only half there, as if her very fabric had tangled in the web. No, as if she was woven together with it. Perhaps that explained why she felt such pain. Only long training allowed Rel to suppress the wince that almost closed his eyes as he saw with sympathy how tightly the Sherim already held his Four Knot.
Within our schools the proselytising is unremitting, as a female teenager in the 1980's I can testify that, even back then, the pressure to sleep with a black or brown man just to prove you were not racist was intense, and I am sure that it is now ten times worse. I personally did not capitulate, but there were many who did, and I don't think it was always by choice.
Usually a palate cleanser need no description, but I think I ought to give this a mention here. When the palate cleanser of watermelon sorbet with kiwi was served, I remarked to Hubby that he could have mine as well since there was kiwi. 2 minutes later, Conrad returned with another palate cleanser for me, watermelon sorbet with watermelon cubes which he said "doesn't look as nice as the other one but at least you can eat this." I have to say I was really impressed with this small gesture, attentive service indeed!

Each week has word cards (for a word wall or focus wall or sorting activity center or whatever!), two different word lists (vertical and horizontal), spelling handwriting practice, a practice page for writing words in frames, and then the spelling test form. I have my kiddos write a sentence each week on their test. Sometimes I dictate it, but most of the time they can write whatever they want. They have to use at least one spelling word and I check the sentence for caps and ends and spelling.

The lipid panel was quite revealing, however. I mentioned a while back that I had changed my diet. I have eliminated meat and dairy from my diet and started a plant-based, organic lifestyle with an elimination of as many processed, pre-packaged foods as I could possibly handle.
The game was tighter than I imagined it would be. The Ravens brought their A-Game and then some. I do not know why I was expecting anything else. Oh I don't know...maybe the losses that we shouldn't have had?
Decision #4: Writing a pointless blog post before cleaning my house. At least I'm assuming this will be unpopular with the adults in the house, me included, when I get to the end of the day and still have 13 bins of random stuff strewn about my bedroom, right where I plopped them in my mad cleaning-for-meeting rush yesterday.

Today nine out of 11 businesses on the Coney Island boardwalk received letters from Italian amusement company, Zamperla/CEI, which leases the property from the city. These tenants have lost their leases and have only until Nov. 15 to vacate the property. Businesses that received these letters are all part of the heart and character of Coney particularly Ruby's and Gyro Corner. These businesses are all family run and are being asked to leave in 15 days after years of business. The only ones allowed to stay are Nathan's and Lola Starr boutique.
Okay so my main problem with this book is that it is named Siren. Guess what Vanessa spends the whole book doing? Well, she is trying to figure out what is killing people in the waters outside of Winter Harbor. I felt like shaking her the whole book and saying "Duh, it's Sirens! Obviously!" It would have been better to title the book something that doesn't totally give away the mystery that the characters spend most of the book trying to solve.
The characters came first, the mad king and his neglected daughter. The image of the king dangling from his scaffolding about to put the last card in place on his enormous card castle just popped into my head one day.

Another thing, that I guess did not help, was having to do a lot of this:
Anyhow, back to Holly. One of the reasons why I chose her design for my cards is that I love her point of view, and felt like she'd be able to convey mine. In fact, she recently wrote a post on her darling and well-illustrated blog that reads like a pragmatic (and admirably succinct) manifesto for Our Generation. I think it's worth sharing.
In a recent decision, two judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit voiced sharp disagreement about the role of the question of patent eligibility, 35 U.S.C. § 101, in lawsuits presenting challenges to the validity of issued patents.

Let me give you an example. A student was targeting a weekly women's magazine. So, you'd be right in thinking that the core readership of this publication is female. But, the student wasn't thinking of a female readership as they wrote the following line:
Today, the colours have been selected by our amazing Julie and they really are another pretty combination:
The class was perfect, it wasn’t significantly different than the typical Yoga Vida class, but it was nice to have less students and more individualized attention. We even got adjustments during shavasana- a first for me at yoga vida. ahhh bliss.
The music starts in the opening scene with you seeing Doc, an inventor, and his loving dog, Sprocket. Sprocket chases Uncle Matt, a Fraggle, as he explores "Outer Space" and sends picture post cards to the Fraggles. Uncle Matt explores Outer Space through a crack in the wall.
It may not have been a smooth arrival into this world, but in my heart I knew he was a fighter and would be okay. He fought and is okay.
So this weekend I’m off, leaving Knight in slightly muddy armor in charge of the Duo as Snarky and I crash the Desert Dreams Writer Conference. Hopefully we’ll make a few new conquests…umm..friends.
and i am getting excited for this new adventure.
I find you very attractive.
Obviously by this point I was still exhausted and now feeling like a bit of a fool lugging my crap through the middle of this parade but it was just so amazing that I honestly didn’t care if I looked like a crazy tourist. The entire experience was the perfect cherry to top off a pretty darn perfect weekend.

Remember, this is not restricted to insurgents in Iraq who are detained in prison camps – the manual makes it clear that the policies also apply “within U.S. territory” under the auspices of the DHS and FEMA. The document adds that, “Resettlement operations may require large groups of civilians to be quartered temporarily (less than 6 months) or semipermanently (more than 6 months).”

Also I have started on redoing the master bath and bedroom. I got a good start on the bathroom just to be rudely interrupted with a case of FOOD POISONING!!! Oh my lands... that was the worst. experience. ever. I have never had food poisoning before and I pray to the good Lord above that I never get it again. but, even that event was made better when I found out that I won a give away on YOUNG HOUSE LOVE. John and Sherry are so talented and entertaining I love to visit their DIY blog every day. I won a DIY book by Jen Lancaster and a $100.00 gift card to Home Depot! just in the nick of time for my master room make over!!!
I raided the Fourth of July section at Target and Dollar Tree for just about everything....rafts, pennants, paper lanterns, food baskets, and tablecloth. The centerpiece was clippings from our Yellow Belle bushes.

Not a good afternoon. I had emailed my husband the above link, forever trying to explain/help him understand who or what I am, but he never responded in any way. This evening, I sent him another email saying that even if he doesn’t want to talk about it (I will respect that) it would mean a lot to me for him to acknowledge getting the email and reading it, and following/reading the links. I am trying to respect his boundaries and asking him to respect mine – I think. Maybe just respect me.
Thank you to everyone who entered and spread the word. I am humbled by your excitement about my contest!
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
It's very inspiring and for such good causes, I encourage you all to become a member, or at LEAST sign these petitions: (!!!) All you have to do is click take action on the bottom of the page, and fill in your details. Or you can first click on your own country at the top of the page, and find petitions from there and sign.
And if what we're trying to do, and working really hard at, is "unparenting," then I guess it's kind of a worthy goal, in my opinion. Maybe I should just get comfortable with it, own it, and sell it as positive?
Seventeen-year-old Majesty Alistair wants police to look further into her father's fatal car wreck, hopes the baseball team she manages can reclaim the state crown, aches for Derek...or, no...maybe Alec...maybe. And she mostly wishes to retract the hateful words she said to her dad right before slamming the door in his face, only to never see him again.
So in real life I went to bed, got up, ate two breakfasts to restore my stamina, went to work, worked on some new songs, picked up my boy from daycare, cooked and ate dinner, had a bath, helped the wife attach some hair extensions and ripped some old CDs into iTunes, then sat back down again for another go at Darkwood Forest. While I was doing all these things, my dude for some reason was wandering back around the outer edge of the forest back to where he came in, instead of just turning around and walking back the way he came.

Seriously, and I hope you all know that I’m letting you in on a personal secret of unparalleled caliber. You see, when I was little, I never learned how to ride a bike. It’s fairly tragic, really. And on The Bachelorette, there’s always a beach boardwalk bike ride, or a mountain bike ride, or a canyon bike ride. I’d be the first bachelorette to request one of those stupid adult trikes…

And still the estate is shabby. But it’s chic. It has a thriving art quarter. The area attracts a huge deal of interest and visitors. It’s become a sort of fingerless glove attached to one of Bridport’s hands.
And it's so sad to admit, but that's all I remember of my one glorious day in Germany. My sister spent several years there and her remembrances of castles and cheeses make me want to go back someday. Einmal, gehe ich zuruch nach Deutschland.

But Beki formed a new Vice Squad in 1997. The new group has released several albums of "old school"-style punk music, and continues to tour.
The chevron background was stamped & heat embossed with clear embossing powder & the tag then initially inked with a rainbow of Nick Bantock inks. The letter masks were then positioned & another layer of inks applied in the masked areas. After taking the masks off I carefully ironed the whole tag to remove the clear embossing powder & finally stamped & heat embossed the crowns in black.
Note to self: file somewhere between "very disappointed" and "never again". Especially, especially at 100€ a head.

In my extremely brief pursuit of a paranormal experience, I have found that stories are often more interesting than the actual experience. Stories of the Joplin, MO spook light are exhilarating and exciting. Sitting in a car on a county road, debating with friends over whether or not that light in the distance is a tower or a supernatural being, is not exciting. This summer I hope to engage in another investigation, although this is more for research purposes. I have an idea for a fresh perspective on ghosts, and by way of research I hope to visit a reportedly haunted hotel. If something interesting happens, fantastic! If not, the story is still interesting, I think.
The smoke is a bit strong, and will need to age. Kinda bacony, but maybe I'm equating the flavor to smoked bacon. The smoke overpowers the malt. More hops might have cut through the smoke, too.
A. It might be because you have been tricked by beer marketing men into thinking that by drinking their beer you can negate the effects of a bogan attitude to women and poor hygiene. It may also be because you’re ugly and your mum dresses you funny.

Intelligibility is one of those language-related concepts that everyone talks about and nobody knows what it means. It serves, for example, as a handy (read: ‘futile’) trick to assign inexistent boundaries to languages, which are said to be mutually unintelligible, versus dialects of the “same” language, which are said not to be. On this issue, I refer to Spanportishese, as above. We human beings in fact appear to be the only species for whom unintelligibility is an issue: Russian horses, say, and Brazilian ones seem to have no trouble communicating with one another, as far as we human beings can ascertain.

Next, crumble up a small amount of your favorite cheese over the Matzo. Here I’m using a low-fat Cabot basil/tomato medium moisture mozzarella I bought from COSTCO. You could certainly use a medium-moisture grated Polly-O mozz like a decent New York slice shop might have used 20 years ago but I think a fresh mozzarella would be a waste. Obviously, if you’re strictly observant you want to use a Kosher for Passover cheese, but your mileage may vary.

If need be, cut or break carcass into pieces will fit in a large stock pot and add the carcass to the pot. Add vegetables, thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, and water. Place pot over high heat and bring to a full boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for about two hours. Occasionally, skim off any foam that forms on the surface.
Although hailed as a victory by both sides, if the ruling stands that out-of-state retailers must first buy the brands from a licensed wholesaler within the state of Texas before shipping directly to the consumer, this would imply a solid affirmation of wholesalers rights, providing strong legal ground for distributors in future cases legal challenges.
Gore Vidal likes to explore round all the nooks and crannies of my dirty little cave. Party Time, who had to take to the streets and sleep on the footpath this last few months has thusly chosen to sleep on the floor instead of in my bed or on the sofa, which is where he used to kip when he lived with me before. So Party Time stays down on the floor most of the time and playing with Gore Vidal I enjoy seeing his, albeit flaky, composure return.

To wit I offer the chart of Sterling, the British pound versus the USD. As you’ll know the UK’s GDP print last week was pretty poor and showed the first double dip recession since last time the IMF was in the UK in the 1970′s. But Sterling rallied as you can see in the chart below.
I have photos of me as a kid, missing teeth, pigtails and all, wearing t-shirts with “France” and “Paris” and “Oh la la!!” plastered all over them. Despite my adolescent predisposition to love all things French, I had to warm up to it when I moved here. It was surprising. I thought I would blend in with the French, that my language skills would make me fit the mold that seemed destined to be mine since I learned to sing “Frère Jaques”… how naive I was. I’m about as American as they come, and a move wasn’t going to change that.

Demons: They haunt us from the time we are little and continue lurking through our entire lives. They are the monsters in the closet, the boogie man under the bed; the images in our minds composed of all the stories we hear from those around us. Demons are the monsters that are created out of pure insecurity and cliché. From a young age we are led to believe that parts of life are meant to scare us. These fears cause us to lose sleep, to question every move we make, and they slow us down from prevailing through challenges. When we are younger, we eventually grow out of our silly fears, because we realize that there aren’t really monsters in the closet and so forth. At this time we are in our young adult to adult years; these are the years when we are faced with the opportunities in life that will ultimately turn our caterpillars into butterflies.

Unfortunately, their tendency has been NOT to surrender, and we cannot expect they will. Additional destruction may be required. There is evidence suggesting they are still planning further moves, as I will discuss.
A popover is a light, hollow roll made from an egg batter similar to that used in making Yorkshire pudding. The only difference is you do not add the savory drippings from the roast. I'm going to guess that popover got it's name because the batter swells or "pops" over the top of the tin while baking. You can use a muffin tin, ramekin or a popover pan.

In regards to hair I am succeeding. I haven’t cut my hair in months, and it is wild, free, matted and unkempt. My ex’s step-sister keeps telling me to cut it, but this is silly. I don’t tell her to cut her hair, and she’s a ranga, and everyone knows red hair isn’t half as nice as the smooth jet black hair I possess. Also when I get out of the shower I can make my hair all spiky like an anime/manga character. This also looks cool.
According to the empty pews on Sunday morning in churches all over the world, people aren’t running back to GOD. The U.S. Congregations website states that the churches that are growing are doing these five things: (1) Welcoming new people; (2) encouraging participation; (3) offering meaningful worship experiences (4) helping people grow spiritually; and (5) committing to a positive future.
My excitement was increased by Obama’s statement. Obama appeared a little bit later, and delivered a really bad statement. He said that the FIFA decision was the “wrong decision.”

After lunch we got some coffee and and matcha latte, and went for a quick shopping trip at Broadway.
Guy’s father Gervais is a fascinating character. He doesn’t talk about the war when he meets with Guy; his first son Gervais died in WWI, his second son Ivo went mad and starved himself to death, and now only Guy is left. There is no talk of the war, only a Lourdes medal and going to Mass the next morning. At Mass the priest speaks in his sermon of a time of danger, doubt, and suffering.
I met Minister Menicucci during her recent visit to Washington for a meeting of the Inter-American Commission of Women at the Organization of American States (OAS). That same week, the U.S. Congress had taken up reauthorization of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, a law once supported by bipartisan majorities but that today’s GOP leadership is angling to defund.

The sensational story of Chen Guangcheng took an even stranger turn today when the Chinese human rights activist walked out of the American Embassy in Beijing after holing up there for six days following a daring and dramatic escape from house arrest.
In the article Virginia also goes on to describe an evening spent with Lauren at her cottage- ‘We are both vegetarians so I’ll make soup, quiche, apple crumble, and we’ll sit by the fire and talk about animals.’ I loved the warmth and cosiness of this image as well as the precise details about the food. In this story Lauren is very good at describing the delights of feasting.

There's an entertaining and fairly polemical article which touches on some of these issues by Paul Reeskamp: "Dr No in trade mark country: a Dutch point of view", Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice (2010) 5 (1): 29-38 (abstract here). I expect that there's plenty more out there, but Paul's piece sticks in my mind since I had to edit it for publication ...

So for its few flaws, Black God, White Devil is an essential film. Yet it goes largely unheard of and unwatched in the West. Perhaps it was too fiery and deemed too Leftist for average American audiences. Whatever the reason, it should be studied and valued as a pinnacle of expressive filmmaking as well as a potent polemic for all those who study the injustice that inhabits the world.
The second film was the new Michael Caine action flick called Harry Brown, and...wow! It was gritty and tense and pretty fuckin great. I had only minor complaints really, and it was awesome to see Caine in this sort of role again. It was like a Death Wish kind of story, and I found myself involved emotionally more than any film I've seen here.

Being the stubborn paisan that I am, I didn’t take any of this into consideration at first.

For me it has worked miracles, if you are suffering from an ailment and have tried everything, I say to you read about it fully and make the decision as to whether to try it.
Somewhere along the road of my life, I developed a sharp disdain for romance, clichéd behavior and any emotional display. When I turned 20, I could only describe myself as fiercely independent, rational and “cold”. And frankly, I didn’t give a damn about anyone, or their feelings. Love was something I didn’t truly seek; maybe because I didn’t believe in it. I’d had a string of relationships (sometimes a few at the same time), and people came in and out of my life often. Each person taught me to control my emotions, each “involvement” made me a harder person, until I was virtually terrified of Love. Or maybe I was simply indifferent to it.

Besides, why do only the most self-obsessed snobs like Jenny & Linda & Jim Lloyd seem to have the reading habit? The rest fret about any hint of reading, and truly worthy characters prefer cooking and baking and growing flowers. Although Usha the good lawyer reads, she is such a token character that it hardly counts.
Each evening, beginning at 5pm, there are musical groups set up on the different stages all along the riverwalk area next to the Tennessee River, with each night's headlining group on the Coco-Cola Stage at 9pm. They try to represent all genres of music - rock and roll, country, blues, zydaco, jazz, folk, even a Faith and Family Night. One year we had Vince Gill as a headliner, and another Trisha Yearwood. Last year (2009)the headliners were Willie Nelson (who sorely disappointed), Little Richard (David said he also didn't deliver), Montgomery Gentry (really rocked), Train, Three Dog Night, B-52s, Steve Curtis Chapman, and the Commodores. And dozens of other groups on the various other stages. I told you this year's lineup in the last post.
