:: An Unconditional Icebreaker ::
British youth has since had its native Beserker genes blunted by the pacifist bromides of higher education and its rage against tyranny sapped by a spurious sense of pseudo-socialist solidarity with the Soviet. This explains how its epic performance in Spain and Normandy was followed by the shameful slouch towards Aldermaston in the 1950s, and the reduction of Vietnam War protests to grandstanding for Ho Chi Mindlessess.
blonde, blonde hair a la kasia struss. a combination of impending summer and itchy feet has left me craving a big change and dying my hair blonde. I'd really love to have the same caramel colour as when I was younger, before my eyebrows darkened and became two large giveaway barriers.
I love the top of these crew socks; it rolls rather than being a band and just plain looks pretty.

In 1970 Johnny Cash introduced her on TV, singing Fancy, as "our Mississippi River Delta Queen, Bobbie Gentry." Internationally, she had now consolidated after her first instant rush of fame and was a genuine star. In Vegas she had a million dollar contract. "I write and arrange all the music, design the costumes, do the choreography, the whole thing," she said. "I'm completely responsible for it. It's totally my own from inception to performance. I originally produced Ode To Billie Joe and most of my other records, but a woman doesn't stand much chance in a recording studio. A staff producer's name was nearly always put on the records." Fame doesn't get more glamorous than aftershow parties with Elvis, yet a melancholy single called Apartment 21 that summer suggested she was beginning to feel trapped by it.
Say what you like about the French, but you have to take your hat off to their no-nonsense approach in the fight against AIDS.

There we were on a train. By the way, its very rare for westerners to ride trains. They aren’t exactly, well… luxurious. But time to relax it was. We’d seen 250 people make professions of faith and we planted 5 churches. Our hard work? Finished. So we shared a few laughs and joked around, not really paying the Indians all around us much attention. We were tired of doing ministry. At least, I was (can’t believe I’m admitting this). Yet, across the aisle from us a young woman smiled and seemed to join in on our jolly mood. We soon found out that she, Sai, spoke english very well. So we invited her to sit with us. “Do I know you? On facebook or something?” she asked Jason, one of our team mates from Texas. Of course Jason didn’t know her.
‘Many documents show how hard it became to recruit curiales (mayors) for cities, governors for provinces, and military officers, because Christians refused to hold such offices……Some modern historians think that this general defection on the part of Christians was one of the most important reasons for the decline of Rome from the 4th century onwards.’
A woman named Maura Kelly works for Marie Claire Magazine. Several days ago, her editor asked her what she thought of watching fat people in situation comedies on t.v. Maura wrote this article: "Should Fattie's Get a Room, Even On T.V.?"
I don’t know what the hell it is but there’s something about the idea of going home with a 20y.o that makes me think “this isn’t right”. And then maybe I start to think about what they were doing six years ago and what I was and I nearly want to pat them on the head and say “that’s nice, dear”.

I'm sure you know how the story goes, but humor me. Charlotte LOVES pulling the wipies out of the wipie box. After I found her sucking on about five of them at one time, I became VERY dilligent about making sure the box lid was closed and they were put away in the cupboard. The combination of those two things have kept her out of them.
We all know that Jenkins could do with a bit of counselling but their is no doubt when it comes to his footballing skills that he is a top talent. Following Jenkins was Iasaiah Pead, a future replacement for aging running back Steven Jackson?
Mr Howes gave an overview of the renewable energy progress to date and the different technologies resulting from the national energy action plans. Further he explained the role of CCS in the electricity mix and the necessary conditions for a successful implementation. Mr Howes also gave some key figures of a public consultation on renewable energy.

And, quite simply, I had an absolute ball with this. Some beers lent themselves easily to the challenge, as you will see, and others had to be coaxed into the framework a little bit. Some beers were a treat to be included in the program while some really had to be forced into the trolley and taken home, as you will see.
Normally, I find working with vibrant colours quite easy, but found myself at a loss as I think my mojo decided it was already on holidays.

“But that which will excite the greatest astonishment by far, and which indeed especially moved me to call the attention of all astronomers and philosophers, is this, namely, that I have discovered four planets, neither known nor observed by any one of the astronomers before my time.”
After watching her, eternally silent, in Pandora's Box, it can come as a surprise that Louise Brooks later spoke plenty in interviews, documentaries and the collection of essays she wrote, Lulu in Hollywood, before dying broke and alone in her Rochester, N.Y., apartment at the age of 79 in 1985.

If it was feasible, possible, or in all reality if I were able, I’d drive there tonight and sit on the beach. I’d take off my shoes and soak my feet in the cool water. I’d lean back and gaze out at the expanse of the river, allowing the gentle lapping of that shimmering water against sand to ebb and wash away the dust and worries of everyday life.
for the move blogging would be too tempting for me to spend more money.

Another major difference is the placement of the flash plug. It is below the hood, while Pet-2 keeps it under the hood. Visually, this doesn't make that much of a difference, but it changes the design of the shutter plate, keeping you from swapping these parts between Pet-1 and Pet-2. You can actually put the Pet-1 shutter plate in Pet-2 with some degree of success (i think it's always on Bulb), but the Pet-2 plate will not fit into Pet-1.
This afternoon I asked Kaelen what he wanted to eat for lunch. He informed me that he wanted "yucky" to eat. Jaikob entered the room moments after Kaelen and I had our discussion. Turning to Jaikob, Kaelen enthusiastically asks, "Jaikob, you want yucky to eat?"
This simple combination of ingredients belies the complexity of the process involved in preparation. Later on when I chat again with Mori, I find out a little more about his story.

For a casual day away from the French Quarter, visit the Garden District for lunch and a view of old mansions of the deep south. Lafayette Cemetery, the most elegant of all the NOLA cemeteries, is located here. Just catch the St. Charles Street trolley and step off at Washington Avenue.
But a strange thing happened . . . I made all of the changes, and not only did they work, they made my manuscript better. Much better.
I remember when He filled me with His Holy Spirit and I finally knew that I was His and He was mine!! It felt so natural to call Him father! To talk to Him and pour out my heart to Him. Sin was no longer my master; He was. What a wonderful feeling to know that the God of all creation heard and answered little old Michael Buckley’s prayer and blessed me with His spirit and eternal life!
Social media is a good way to find new partners and create partnerships. In his 2012 Social Media Marketing Industry Report,[1] Michael A. Stelzner reported that 56 percent of those who invested 6 to 10 hours per week over a few months with social media marketing found new partnerships.

Participating whole life values can be used in a number of financial plan designs. If your client is looking for supplemental retirement income, premium payments are made using after-tax dollars. When properly structured and funded, loans and withdrawals can be accessed from the policy on a tax-free basis. In a properly designed policy, there are generous limits on the amount of cash that can go into the policy and no restrictions as to the timing of when to take the cash out as supplemental income. Remember, the policy would need to stay in force until the insured’s death so that the distribution made at that time would not be subject to federal income tax; otherwise, if distributions are made prior to death (other than loans) any gain in the policy may be subject to taxation.
That same year, Gladstone's characteristically priggish opposition to Palmerston's divorce liberalization bill failed to carry the day -- the last of his moralistic crusades.

Yes, yes, I knew we were under a winter storm warning and the predictions were not exactly pretty, especially considering it is still October... it is still October isn't it? I didn't fall into some deep Sleeping Beauty slumber that gave me the illusion I was awake whilst all along I was really sleeping? Precious time ticking away - just enough to allow Winter Goddess to get dressed in her magnificent gowns of silvery-whites sparkling with those fabulous blue/white diamonds and tuck Fall Goddess into her soft radiant multicolored bed of leaves to slumber away for another year?
That doesn't sound out of the ordinary to you? Well it certainly is in my part of Wisconsin. It is normally still snow covered, blustery and gray days still this time of year. I have no complaints on the weather. Winter was unusually mild, only a few heavy snows that did not last horribly long. Yes, still some cold frigid days full of gray skies, but with less snow it was more tolerable!

When you left, he felt a bit sad. However, you comforted him well. He noticed a note on the coffee table, on a folded piece of ripped line paper. He opened it up and this is what it read.

Art can be created from the most simple objects and mediums. I love how words and quotes are becoming pieces of art themselves. I came across Ji Lee's work - Word as Image - and loved the clever manipulation of letters becoming the images they represent.
I am not sure what this website is about. I was googling the name of my deceased Uncle, Ron Santi, and I hit your website. My uncle Ron was an animator in the 30's, 40's, and 50's. He has been forgotten. No one seems to know him although he worked for Looney Tunes, Terrytunes, Disney. He animated Heckle & Jeckle, invented Frosty the Snowman. I don't know about Bulldog Drummond and I cannot recognize his artwork, he kept so little of it. His real name was Romolo A. Santi, known as Ronnie. If you think we are talking about the same man, contact me. I don't want to put my email address down here. Contact me through Facebook: Blaise Picchi Ms. Picchi, if you come across this blog, I hope by now you have found out more about your uncle. We'd all be interested in learning anything we can of him. If anyone out there worked with Santi in animation or the comics maybe they could tell us what they know.
After three days of juice fasting, all the internal and external cleansing and a four hour yoga workshop that Friday evening, nothing has ever tasted better than the vegan split pea soup we shared together. That last sweat lodge was an intensely spiritual experience, in part because I had done it before, so I was free of fear that entering the lodge was a mistake. Every cell in my body was tingling with excitement.

Personally, I couldn't love this manicure more. It's simple, green and super shiny ♥ I admit that I was totally biased, wanting to love it made me work harder to make it work ;) The name and colour is what won me over, it's very hard to love through swatch pics, as it looks so black. Unless you're a hardcore dark green lover and jelly tolerater/lover like me, I don't think Aragon will do much for you - it's not a perfect green creme but it will work if you love it enough and have the patience for three coats.
Blog Challenge, number 23 for April 2012:
Consensus: The Man Who Wasn’t There shows the Coens in a good-form with fine performances from the cast, nice touches for its score and camera-work, and a nice story that builds up more and more, but also has characters that you may find it harder to connect with which makes it even harder for you to care what really goes down in the first place.
Okay, two copies of Silverblade Paladin together with two copies of Zealous Conscripts in the graveyard when reviving the angel… is awesome! You can do plenty of tricks, giving different cards Haste and Double Strike. The angel on its own can hit for 8 damage that very turn. Or, if your opponent has no blockers, give your Paladins haste, and pair them with your conscripts, that attack will deal 20 damage.
She’s also gone on extensively about how she won’t take me to Beautiful Town because Grand Ma Normal Family and Sweet Aunt would “crucify” her. She told Angry Man earlier that she was going to beat the crap out of me, tie me up, and then kill me.
The fruits are plum shaped and need to ripen for 4 – 6 months. The avarage yield is 15 – 20 kilograms of fresh fruit per tree, with a maximum up to 45 kilograms. Each kilogram of fruit yields about 400 grams of dry seeds – per tree it is 400 grams x 15 kilograms, about 6000 gram of nuts – and that for about 200 years!
Unfortunately, legal douchebagdom is not the issue here. The issue is the First Amendment of the Constitution and its protection of free speech.

Lanre Idowu expertly x-rayed the news media, pointing out what they did right and what they could have done better. Few tasks are more treacherous than assessing the performance of your own colleagues, but Idowu pulled it off magnificently week after week.
At this point, I imagined a vulture, circling the skies, looking out for dead and dying creatures on the desert floor that is this woman's vagina. Suffice it to say I kept my mouth shut for fear of what other tidbits this elderly lady might want to share. Now I know why they call it menopause. Because at that age, the things that these women say give men-a-pause! Whether it's hormonal changes altering behavior or these women just don't give a damn any more, I don't know.
Anyhow, a day of this is exhausting but also satisfying. In the evening we had the postgrad poets over for long-delayed drinks, those who could come, and a fine time was had by all after a few glasses of wine. I was suggesting to a football lover just off to Barcelona, that he might apply to be poet-in-residence at the Nou Camp. I am not sure why I give my best ideas away like that.
So I had a bunch of over ripe bananas this morning and thought I would bake us a tasty treat for tomorrow morning! I've been in a banana bread rut though. I usually make the stand by classic recipe or chocolate chip banana muffins. These are both great, but I searched for different recipes online and came across this one from allrecipes.com! Seriously...it rocks! I looove spiced cake or muffins so this is right up my alley.
The exfoliator contains fine jojoba beads and eucalyptus so again skin feels super clean yet the gentle formulation is very kind to the skin. This is a great blackhead buster and my pores have dramatically reduced in size. Hoorah!

“To the citizens of the United States of America: We are Anonymous,” a synthesized voice announces. “This is a special emergency message regarding the status of the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.

In the meantime, I continue a gentle skin regime fashioned during that earlier, problem-filled time.
The evidence indicates that while ZERO may describe the particular amount of an ingredient or the nutritional content, by itself, ZERO only describes a general absence of some ingredient normally present. Thus, we are convinced that while ZERO merely describes a feature or characteristic of soft drinks, it is not so highly descriptive as to identify a product category.

I remember it was conversation set to music, and quite unlike any movie I had ever seen. I thought it charmingly lovely, and could see it again over forty years later if I wanted to as it was re-released in 1997.
This week, the Coptic Orthodox Church announced that it was withdrawing from talks on a new Egyptian constitution because Islamist domination of the process has made its participation ‘pointless’. The haemorrhage continues. There are no such problems in the Gulf, of course, where Christians, virtually all ‘guest workers’, have no chance of becoming citizens. The Saudis have gone one step further to preserve their ethnic purity: churches and Christian worship, in line with the opinion of Sheikh Abdullah, have been outlawed (the small, isolated community of Syriacs are forced to live as ‘catacomb Christians’ and worship in secret).
The past three days had ended the same. Sitting in some room, with the lights off and the soft glow of the television set illuminating my tired, worn face. The faces and lips of the people on screen just move, and move, and move. No, they aren't making any sense. It's all crap.

In order for your metabolic rate to be normal and burn the calories you take in, adequate nutrition needs to come into the body and be absorbed by your cells. Absorption however can often be stalled as gluten sensitivity causes malabsorption due to the damage it creates in the small intestine.
Leonard is so great here. Enunciation and joy in the lines. You can see why he went on to have a great stage career. I once saw him in a production of Tom Stoppard’s The Invention of Love and he was transcendentally good (in another campus role as well).

It goes all the way back to pre-history. Human beings like regularity and predictability. Change is bad. Consider the existence of a hunter-gatherer – living life in the wild – every change in the weather…every change in the environment…every new sound in the night…new people…new animals. Every one represents a mortal threat.
I use a lot of frosting, I used to just use a simple and basic butter cream version, but it never really "did" it for me. So when I was whipping up a batch one day I decided to add in a few more elements to my Basic Butter Cream recipe.....and OMG not only was it better but it was fantabulous.
Shane was my third maid in four months. Good help, as the saying goes, is indeed hard to find. My first maid was an elderly, heavy set lady. I didn’t fire her because she repeatedly stole food, was generally terrible at cleaning, or because she couldn’t speak a word of English. No. I fired her because she had the penchant of taking a massive shit every morning while I ate breakfast. While this may sound callous, I prefer not to eat adobo in a tiny condo smelling of fecal matter and methane.

The markers on the other side of the image were colored with Neutral grays as well. I blended the colors more than I did on the shiny metal of the multiliner. Again, I used Opaque white to enhance the shine on the markers, as well as add the glints of light back into each horse's eyes.
Ok, there are so many things wrong with that statement. Why did I have a good day? Why was I able to do hard work for the entire length of the 8 hour shift? Because my body allowed me too, that’s why. My temple worked hard and performed amazingly. And what do I want to do? Poison it with diet coke. AS A REWARD?! What the *heck* is that about? I mean really… just, really?
But the perspective of the first example is that they know what is best for my story, for ME, and they will pull me up and teach me what it is. Which is awfully presumptuous. And a little jerky.

Social media, information governance, search technologies and project management all have sessions set aside for them, and there is a session called eDiscovery from a judicial viewpoint. It is good also to see one called Knowing your eDiscovery tools – conferences shy away from this, probably because it is difficult to choose representative examples without upsetting some of the sponsors, but delegates get an overview of the range of applications which is available.
French toast and fruit salad
Its blended using rums from both a double distilled pot still and a continuous still to give it a vanilla and honey nose with ripe exotic fruits pushing their way through. On the palate it gives off subtle sweet characteristics of spice with the vanilla being slightly more potent. Gives a bit of a kick on the way down but it leaves a mellow after-taste soon after.

However, the more we learned about the Ferber Method, the more it made sense to us. In holding Alex in our arms until he was completely asleep, we made it inevitable that he would be completely confused and disoriented any time he woke up in the crib. Who could blame him?

Even stranger is obfuscation. (The most appropriately named technology EVER). It seems that in bundling a font into ePub, the font is intentionally obfuscated (scrambled) to prevent someone from extracting the font from the eBook and using it. How many people can crack open an ePub or Mobi file? Unfortunately, not all reading systems will display an obfuscated font, an obfuscated font is so safe from piracy that it is pretty much useless.
There must be fifty novels, hard and softcover, waiting to be read as this is written. Month after month they pour in, a deluge of fiction and one can only wonder at the size of the market for them all. Here are some recommendations for a select few.
2. Tomorrow Never Knows — Why don’t the Beatles get credit for pioneering house or even trip hop? TNK is 20-some years ahead of its time. I still think there hasn’t been much that even comes close to matching the rhythm section of this song. I get shivers just about every time I hear it.

Earlier this month I wrote the article Canon’s Secret Weapon for Landscape Photography about their incredible EF 17-40mm f/4L USM ultra-wide zoom lens.

The piece on the Costa Concordia two weeks ago obviously touched a nerve in Brussels. Within days, we had a protest from the commissioner himself, a note from the commission's head of media services and a letter from Professor Dracos Vassalos, who was mentioned in the piece.
And now…for the sneak peek picture!Here it is:
I promised further explanation of this year’s theme. Can’t say I can, other than to reiterate that it isn’t really dystopia — though there was a good bit of that — nor scifi, or speculative fiction as high-end scifi is frequently styled these days. The subtitle was “Literature of the Future” and the guiding texts were 1984 and Brave New World, if that helps. In his introduction in the Seminar’s program, Program Chair James Gleick writes this, referring to the writers gathered for the Seminar: “What they do share — what their work reveals — is a deepening awareness of past and future, which also means an awareness that our world is not the only one possible.”

SOPA would allow the offending website to be blocked immediately, with the “burden of proof then resting on the website to get itself un-blocked” (Wikipedia’s SOPA page). Opponents of the proposed law say that websites would in future need to remain vigilant against the possibility that infringing material could be posted on their pages. In such a situation, a chilling effect would come into play as website managers would be extremely cautious about what material was posted on pages they hosted. Yes, there is no doubt that the law, if passed, would exert a chilling effect. But maybe it’s time for websites like YouTube to take responsibility for content that is loaded to their pages.

4)DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY - Digital photography is a form of photography that uses an array of light sensitive sensors to capture the image focused by the lens, as opposed to an exposure on light sensitive film. The captured image is then stored as a digital file ready for digital processing (colour correction, sizing, cropping, etc.), viewing or printing.

Writing messages means that the message is at the heart of the story and the author is doing the best that s/he can do to get that message across the her/his reader. There are very few good stories that are written around messages–the only one that I can think of is The Giver, and even that has its faults. Throughout The Giver, Jonas is put at odds between what he has been told to be true by his community and what he realizes is true through his personal experiences. The overarching theme is that our ability to choose is what sets us apart from one another, and this theme appears constantly throughout the book from beginning to end. The heart of the book is a message about the power of choice, and while this makes for very good philosophical reading, it is not something that I would have read on my own in middle school–instead, I was told to. I did not have a choice. Why didn’t I choose to read it? I had thought it a bit dry. I wanted a story, not a lecture.

Pat Colloton, a Leawood Republican who leads the House Committee on Corrections and Juvenile Justice. “We were written up in The Wall Street Journal. I was invited to the White House,” when then-President George W. Bush signed legislation directing $54 million in federal grants to help duplicate Kansas’ success around the country.
In the Greek myth of Pandora, “hope” is the final force left in the box of plagues that is unleashed upon humankind. And while hope is often the only thing one has left, I think that some people seem to ignore the fact that it was still one of the things in the box of plagues. Hope is not a bad plague with which to be plagued, certainly–I’m sure we all prefer it to famine and dysentery, for example–it can still be a harsh and fickle mistress, if not an entirely false one. In the Findhorn Community, when the various Angels that they recognize were being brainstormed and added to a list, Hope was one that was eventually rejected, because of the possibility that Hope can be false, whereas many of the other angels they recognized (Play, Strength, Peace, etc.) are “goods in themselves,” and things that tend to be positive. Of course, some may criticize the “new age” emphasis on only good things implied in this schema, and yet, there is a lesson to be learned in all of this. If it is possible for Hope to betray someone, isn’t that a violation of Fides? And yet again, Fortuna and Tyche are goddesses as much as any other, and their favor is not always guaranteed either.

Throughout my childhood, I was a very quiet child and didn’t have much confidence when it came to communicating with other people in general. I guess I could have been considered ’a loner’. Whether this was anything to do with being an adoptee, I do not know. This all changed at the age of 11 when I went to Comprehensive/Secondary School. I kind of made a conscious decision to be different; to be more outgoing and confident. Starting a new school and a new chapter of my life seemed to be the ideal opportunity to do this. Sometimes I regret this decision and sometimes I don’t.

Wait. That will need some explanation.
However, the book does not chart the journey to healing this pain. The book ends with the author still in pain. Personally at this point of grieving, I need light at the end of the tunnel, some way to continue, so I actually found the book to be quite depressing[5]

As you begin to undertake your journey into social media, take note of my top 5 thoughts on the unwritten rules of social media and how they can affect your business:
The people we know who foster are the “last step” before the dogs are adopted. (I’m only talking dog here because that is what they foster. I don’t personally know anyone who fosters cats) The rescue they help has a kennel that all the rescued dogs are taken to first. Then the vetting process begins. All of the blood work, spay and neutering, etc. is done. Volunteers then take the dogs for walks, training and socializing. Once the animal is given the thumbs up by the veterinarian, it is placed with a foster home, then “fur”ever home.

It's spring here in Oklahoma--even pushing into summer with our upcoming high of 85. At this point in the year, I'm usually bracing for snow and ice (because usually I'm living up north), but this March, I'm walking through the world with a light jacket and watching the trees flower.
These are three issues where I truly feel change is inevitable. We will have voluntary euthanasia, we will allow loving, committed couples who just happen to have similar sets of junk to adopt and raise kids, and we will, as god is my witness etc, have legal, safe, accessible abortion on demand in this damn country.
West Virginia – “Country Roads Take Me Home” does not count. Not only is the state name not in the title, but John Denver spends the whole time describing the Virginia without a direction in front of it. I picked “West Virginia Underground” by Taylor Made.
In 1596 an Algonquian princess with the formal names of Matoaka and Amonute was born in an area known as Tenakomakah (modern day Virginia). She was the daughter of Wahunsunacawh who was the Chief or Powhatan of a confederation of tribes in that area, later known as the Powhatan Empire, and one of his many wives. Due to her carefree antics she received the nickname Pocahontas meaning 'playful one' and became her father's favourite daughter despite her lowly status within the family.

Wiola rode Echo during the session and it was really good to see her work with her - she was able to explain to me exactly what she was feeling and what she was doing to correct it - and as I know Echo so well, I was able to immediately understand what she meant. Wiola has written about the lesson here and it makes a really interesting read; you can also see some video of me cantering. What's interesting is that in the video I felt as if I was almost leaning back I was sitting up so straight - in reality, it looks fairly normal - I have definitely got some work to do on this!

Last week we noticed our cat Fritz was dirty and his lower jaw was swollen. He's always been one of the best groomed cats around. Even when he was locked in the neighbors crawl space for 21 days he came back home cleaner than he was last week. He had also lost a considerable amount of weight. Not a good sign for a cat that would eat all of his food and then chow down on the dogs too.

Whilst awaiting the custody hearing a temporary court order prevented us having any contact with dad (stepfather) and he was not allowed to come within a hundred metres of any place he knew us to be. As I'm sure it did my brother and sister, that hurt and saddened me. In a strange way I had grown to love him... to enjoy him for who he was. I had certainly never imagined that one day he'd not be there. That just kinda happened. Mum had asked us to make a quick-fire decision and we chose 'her'. 5 minutes after nodding our heads, Dad, the dog and the house were gone. It was a shock and none of us really thought through the consequences of that choice. It was only when we understood Dad could end up in prison if he approached us that it really hit home.

the party was called “guttenberg* to zuckerberg” and celebrated the many forms that books can take–our host the owner of the round table books arthur frank opened the evening by showing guests a goat skin bound 16th century book. with my genius friend o.j. dorson i was able to show off a permutation of the notion of books–namely, a multimedia book that tells the story of my year of meeting facebook friends. the next morning, i went to my neighbor caryl seidenberg’s home. she has a press called “vixen press”.
A few years ago now, my New Years resolution was “I must fly my kite more often”. I did not keep that up as much as I should. I recommend a good kite and some time together, you will love it. Last year my resolution was “I must eat more Olives”. Which, a little belatedly I am now covering. Every meal here comes with Olives. There is no meal that the Portuguese would consider unsuitable for an Olive accompaniment and they are good for you.
But even when it comes to defining a species, the picture is not as clear as we would like. There are a few different species concepts in biology. The most familiar and common of the species concepts, the one taught in high schools around the world, is the biological species concept…species are groups of organisms that cannot interbreed.
This product is suitable for all skin types which is why it's particularly good as a Christmas present, and it's pretty versatile. You can either apply a thick layer to your face and neck after cleansing, put your feet up for 10-15 minutes, and remove with a muslin cloth soaked in warm water, then cleanse. Or just leave it on overnight which is what I've been doing as my skin was so dry with the sudden change of weather. In fact this applied to any problem area and left on overnight is really wonderful. It is just gorgeous, natural and soothing.

Teeange Luke comes round from a coma and finds he has synaesthesia - his senses are muddled so that he hears colours and smells sounds, etc. There's a demon lurking in his brain which makes him do bad things; there's also a beautiful girl with cinnamon skin and 'hair as long as the sound of honey' who may or may not be a figment of Luke's imagination. He wants nothing more than to regain his strength, particularly in his bad leg, so he can run in school sports day. The demon has other ideas. Luke's sister is in trouble - stalked in Luke's head by a sinister man in a metal mask, then captured for real by a perverted man who stalks the nearby woods. Luke has to battle both real and imagined foes to save her.
So I’m finally enjoying being pregnant! It’s so nice not being nauseous and wanting to eat. Some foods, like bananas are no longer appealing. However I’m enjoying OJ, grilled cheese and ice cream so I’m not complaining. Even though I don’t look big I can tell she’s there. Munchkin made the plane ride to and from MA a little uncomfortable. I wasn’t able to get into a comfy position since I usually pull my legs up. I couldn’t this time cause she was there! I was very glad to land so I could walk and stretch out my legs. Having an aisle seat on the return trip helped. I’m thinking next time I’ll try not to fly while pregnant!

Beginning on a starry night, an ochre sea star clings to a rock under the crashing waves. When it is high tide, it moves along the ocean floor, avoiding predators. On the shore, it inches along by twisting its body like a pretzel onto the shore to hunt. Coming upon a mussel bed, it hunches over one and grips it with its strong feet. A tug-a-war between them ensues until the sea star successfully cracks and feeds off it, in a most unusual and fascinating manner. Follow this amazing sea creature as it fights its way back to the ocean before the tide recedes while protecting itself from predators.

Still not a good movie, but better than the movie that came before it, Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood goes a lot heavier into the horror category, which it’s much closer to succeeding with than the comedy that failed so painfully in Leprechaun: in the Hood. It looks better and is less racist, but it still can only really survive on its camp and ability to be mocked. This isn’t a movie you particularly need to see. And hopefully this means that Fabio and Ewic will have to find a new in joke that only they find amusing. Fuckin’ assholes … Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood gets “You compromised all you believed in once you got the gold” out of “You so ghetto.”

I know it has been way too long since I have written a new post, and there has been so much going on in my world. I have missed my "blogger" friends...no doubt...but I must admit that I have enjoyed taking a break from the computer to spend time with family and friends. Also, with Baby Girl Maley on the way, it seems like so much of my "free time" is spent planning a nursery and going to bed by 9:30 p.m. - which doesn't leave me many hours at night to post like I normally do.

The movie is in 3-D, but if you are looking to save some cash I think the film would be just as fabulous in 2-D. I’m kind of over the whole 3-D fad and most movies, The Avengers included, just do not use the technology enough to make it worth the extra charge at the ticket booth. The special effects are great, but do not hinge on the use of 3-D.

That was tough. What is the right balance? Should I have canceled the test? Continue with the plan? I am not sure. I didn't know what other teachers were doing. Would it be too much if we all cancelled plans and talked about the situation? I'm not sure. To be honest, I didn't have anything else planned and didn't want to move to the next unit. The test was already a day late due to the snow day and I know some just wanted to be done with it. I still continued yesterday's lecture with the 1950's wearing my pink ladies jacket and pointed frame glasses. We listened to 1950's Rock 'n' Roll today while analyzing the lyrics and cultural impact. I know some of them were not ready for the dancing and laughter. Some definitely were ready.

I e-mailed the photo I wanted in, after sizing it to 3x4 in picasa. I wanted to make sure I could get the crop I wanted, and not leave it to them.

Atonement and repentance are the theme of Yom Kippur (today). It's also a day when the Jewish people ask for forgiveness from people they may have slighted. The concept of approaching people sincerely and forthrightly and setting things right to the extent that you are able is the first step in atonement and repentance. One must do the same with God.

Skype is great...ok, so maybe everyone in the world except me already knows this, but it is really nice...and really free...to video call your family back home, especially when you've left kids at home. My kids like it too...as a matter of a fact, I just got skyped...is that how you say it...by Davis, my 6 year old son. Also, we brought a blow up mattress and pump, and it has been great. The other option if you are traveling with an older child is to pay additional for a roll away bed. The blow up mattress is free and disappears during the day...thanks Scott and Sharla for the advise.
The people at the store were extremely helpful. At the store, I wanted to confirm that the 22 would be okay as a carryon, because it looked quite large to me.

That was exciting for us and we're hoping to be able to plan more meals like this in our future! Well, it's almost midnight so I better hit the sack!

In his later career Cronenberg has become a really interesting director. Okay that’s not true, he’s always been an interesting director and one of my favourites, but there is just something about his later career that astounds me. How he’s been able to take themes that he’s been interested in and explored in some great horror movies, and move it into films that are more accessible to general audiences. Well; a little more accessible. With A Dangerous Method he’s looking at sex, repression and telling it through two of the biggest psychologists; Freud and Jung.

For those who don’t know, Body Pump is the original barbell class that works eight major muscle groups (quads, glutes/hamstrings, chest, back, triceps, biceps, abdominals, and shoulders) to fatigue in one hour, all set to awesome, popular, motivating music. This weekend, I attended my initial training module to become a Body Pump instructor.
Yesterday I was telling our new intern Carlos a story from last summer. I had just box squatted 315 for 5 reps, which was a PR for me at the time. I came back to squat the next week and got absolutely buried by a weight much lighter than that and couldn’t figure out why. The reason is because I never gave my body a chance to catch up to the new training stimulus it was exposed to.

Davis has a point. He and Beason have been top-notch linebackers in the past. Edwards was brought in as a free agent last year and the hope was he would solidify the middle of the defensive line. That didn’t work out as Edwards was injured early in the preseason. Davis and Beason went down early in the regular season.
Boy. I didn’t mean to talk about that. I guess it’s kind of on my mind (understatement). Anyone ever had a similar situation?

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of Calvinism within Baptist churches (e.g., John Piper, Albert Mohler, including hipper and younger Baptists like Mark Driscoll).

They are very religious and kindly people and they do many good deeds on a daily basis. However, the Friendly Neighbor is 1/4 Sioux Indian.

Another thing that is interesting about this record, is that it's the first time you can definitively make out Dick Scoppetone's voice, as their older material was sung by Templeman and Scoppetone in unison making it hard to distinguish whose voice was whose. Scoppetone's voice, which really remains intact from the early Harper's era of the 60s, even almost a decade later, immediately reminds me of Curt Boettcher's voice, particularly later era Curt. The album also reveals that Harpers Bizarre were much more of a real band than history would have you believe, as the material and arrangements and focus on early Americana are pretty consistent with what they were doing with Lenny Waronker, who was seen as the puppet-master of the band, so to speak.

When we vacationed together each summer – all 22 of us in a large rental house on the beach, there was a mandatory talent night. Every family member, from the youngest toddler to the elder Granddad performed a routine – a song, a dance, a skit, what have you. It was hokey but loads of fun, and formed lasting memories. At bedtime on those hot summer nights, this refrain warmed hearts in the darkness “Goodnight John Boy. Goodnight Lisa . . .“ When I divorced years later, the loss of this family hit me hard. But my son’s life is woven into the fabric of both sides of his family.

Early in the week I finished reading Middlemarch. I'd found it heavy going in the middle but for the last third it was quite a page-turner, I thought. It has certainly found a place on my mental list of books I really enjoyed reading. Yesterday I started to read a book my daughter gave me for Christmas: The Quantum Universe by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw. (After that it's going to be An Unofficial Rose by Iris Murdoch). In-car listening for the week has been Radiohead's Kid A.
We have laughed, cried, prayed, worshiped, and rejoiced with our family. We have attended baby dedications, weddings, baby showers, and memorial celebrations. We have helped with harvest festivals and vacation Bible school. We have served together in evangelism and teaching the junior high students. I taught children that were toddlers to upper elementary with another teacher or alone. Don has been on the worship band as a bass and acoustic guitar player, and sometimes drummer or percussionist; and he began and led a youth band for several years. We have seen children grow from babies into young adults.
With the help of the Internet, I did a bit of research on the current methods for body casting and read commentary from others who had hints and tips. After selecting one method to try, I went to several stores to find the needed materials. Then at 4 PM, in the garage, with a black plastic sheet over the floor, I filled a bucket with water and began to cut strips of gauze. Then I took off all of my clothes (yes, I did) and sat on the floor with dozens of gauze strips around me. All different sizes. Very important: use lots of Vaseline on the skin that will touch plaster. Lots of Vaseline, or you may have to chisel the plaster off your skin later.
Whilst I regularly watch my son Harley spiral out of control via behavioural explosions and insomnia in times of stress, I personally retreat and sleep so I don’t have to deal with anything. It’s a classic case of flight mode for me and fight mode for him.

Two cavepeople have an artistically-minded baby who wants to decorate the walls of their home. Cavemother does not appreciate his efforts, much like a more evolved parent, but a woolly mammoth captures the baby and takes him on an exhilarating and a bit frightening ride through the night to another cave.

Now take the dough and divide it into equal small balls then roll each ball into small round about 4 inch diameter. Now fill half the round with khoya mixture and moisten the edges of the side with your fingers fold and seal the round twisting the edges inward. You can also use guyjia mould that are available in Indian stores. Make sure that your filling is not too much otherwise it can ooze out. When all the gujias are made then heat ghee or oil (whatever you are using) and fry this gujias in batches in a medium flame till they are golden brown. Place them on a kitchen paper and strain the excess oil. Garnish the gujias with grated pista and fried cashew. Gujias or pedakiya is a delicious fried Indian pastry I am sure you all will enjoy.

My husband and I are getting ready to have our first child! We are ecstatic but nervous to be first time parents, but my mother-in-law doesn’t think we are capable of doing this on our own. She’s mad because we never read the baby books and is insisting on moving in to care for our baby for the first three months. I told my husband no, but he’s a momma’s boy and the baby is just an excuse to have her here. What should we do? I’m stressed out enough about a new baby, I don’t need an evil mother in law breathing down my neck too.

No offense, old pal. I still like you, but you really haven't proven yourself to be worth the money I paid for you. I still remember the joy I felt when I first saw you in Italy. I had gone on vacation to the boot-shaped peninsula with a friend and had made it a personal goal to buy an authentic Italian espresso maker during my once-in-a-lifetime stay. This goal was inspired by my memories of my family once owning an Italian espresso maker that lasted for nearly 10 years. I was fed up with using the low-quality "Made in China" varieties and just wanted something that would last a little longer. I figured that because I was in Italy, I would be provided with an endless stream of espresso makers.

According to the official version, of course, “democracy” is a system created by the Founding Fathers, based on checks and balances between president, congress and judiciary. In fact, nowhere in the Declaration of Independence or Constitution does it say anything about the US being a “democracy”. The authors of those documents, almost to a man, defined “democracy” as a matter of collective self-governance by popular assemblies, and as such they were dead-set against it.

In a food processor fitted with a large shredding disk, shred the carrots; fit the processor with the metal blade and pulse the grated carrots 3 to 5 times. Pour the carrots into a large mixing bowl. Process the granulated and brown sugars and eggs until frothy and thoroughly combined, about 20 seconds. With the machine running, add the oil through the feed tube in a steady stream. Process until the mixture is light in color and well emulsified, about 20 seconds longer. Pour the mixture into the bowl with the carrots. Stir in the dry ingredients until incorporated and no streaks of flour remain. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cake to room temperature in the pan on a wire rack, about 2 hours.

One could argue that Jack single-handedly helped bring about the demise of brick and mortar newspapers. How? Ever hear of the term "citizen journalism"?

Combine that with the ability to take high quality pictures and video anywhere at anytime and you have millions who can conduct instantaneous, on the spot reporting 24/7/365.

My first introduction to Urban Blight was when I saw them open for UB40 at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City in March of 1984. I was immediately struck by the fact that the singer was playing the drums and that he was at the front of the stage. Next I was amazed at the pure energy and musicianship on display. What was even better was the band really seemed to be enjoying themselves. The fact that they were friends was clearly evident. This was a band who trusted one another and the performed like a well oiled machine. The crowd was behind the hometown boys and they gave UB40 a run for their money.

But then came that awful day, and the spewing sputtered. An emotional earthquake rocked my foundations, and I erected this giant dike in my head, and around my heart and my words stopped coming so freely. After being called unAmerican for voicing my liberal opinion by certain narrow minded people in my family, I stopped wanting to share ANYTHING with ANYONE. I stopped contributing to the diabetes support group I had always followed, I stopped writing long letters during lunch,I stopped writing silly poems. Things and feelings and thoughts and emotions and even actions were choked back, tucked away, hidden, stuffed into the back corners. Words literally failed me, and writing was no longer the outlet it had always been, it no longer made sense and it didn't feel right. I couldn't say anything appropriate or reasonable, and really, the bottom line was, who cared anyway?

Through word of mouth, news was passed around that the Titanic had struck an iceberg and was sinking. The first class passengers were ill prepared for such tragedy since they were utterly convinced that the ship was unsinkable. They were in no hurry to save themselves, and took all the time in the world to dress up for whatever occasion it might be. Some of the ladies took their time to put on their finest gowns and luxurious jewelries. Almost all the first class passengers carried with them a large amount of fortune and some of them were not leaving the commodity in their cabins. Some took with them as much money and important documents as they could while others weren’t as bothered assuming they will be returning to the cabin. None of the first class passenger believed that Titanic was in harms way, not until they saw the pandemonium outside.

I think it's healthy and a GREAT way to "see the world" and connect all kinds of things, places, times, actors, literary forms, composers, dialects... Little Shop of Horrors (the musical, which they all know) is written by (and similar to in many aspects) the guys who did The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast (and in part, Aladdin, I think). They're conversant in a lot of comparison/contrast ways on those subjects.

Hugging etiquette in human societies is a fascinating subject. There are so many ambivalent situations where no one is quite sure whether a hug is appropriate. Consider the question of man-on-man hugging. In Latin countries, it is perfectly normal for buddies to greet each other in that fashion, as long as a safe air corridor is maintained between the trousers. But Anglo-Saxon men are only supposed to do it if they’re gay or work in show business. Women, of course, can cuddle like koalas in any part of the world. No one thinks it's foreplay unless there's bumping and grinding going on.
"... everybody who is now bunkering down in North and Far North Queensland will be starting to experience what they will be living with for the next four or five hours.... it will take all of their strength to endure what they are about to experience. I think it's difficult for us to imagine what it might be like to go through four or five hours of listening to 300 kilometre winds going around our homes, torrential rain and to be doing that in the dark and potentially without any communications. It will not only take all the strength of those enduring it, we as a community, as Queenslanders and as Australians need to brace ourselves for what we might find when we wake up tomorrow morning.
“Wimpie, a white boy who was dabbling with dagga, is put in our cell. I don’t know how old he really is, perhaps 16 or more, but he looks no older than 14, with skinny arms and short, spiky-crowned, brown hair. He tries to fight, and so they hit him. His resistance stops abruptly when one grabs the back of his head and smashes his face into the steel bars. The 20 men take it in turns to rape him. It goes on for more than eight hours, almost the whole night. The boy does everything he can, in his pathetic, limited range of action, to try to deter them, but he is ignored. He screams, he cries, he begs, he tries to bargain, he prays. It is in the morning, though, that I am forced to see what life has coughed up before me. What’s left of Wimpie is lying in a corridor between the bunks, just in front of my bed. He is still naked, shivering in a pool of his own blood where they have discarded him. I will literally have to step over the small body to go and eat my breakfast.”

But also (if it is managed correctly by the leader/s) it offers a platform for participants to speak honestly about how they felt, what they struggled with, where they feel the team did not perform, where they felt the gaps were – even if what it is they have to say is levied at the project leaders/managers/directors. And this certainly is not an easy task! I am only too sure that a number of FTH:K employees would say I was impossible to approach (or that they were too scared of me to criticize!) without me getting defensive. And it would be true. It’s really hard to hear other people criticise your child without the defensive, knee-jerk reaction kicking in, but I’d like to think that for the most part (in particular, with Ugli’s help) what needed to be said got said and said in the kind of way so as to be constructive. It’s a tough position to be in when you know that what you have to say, while critical, is valuable yet you don’t feel that you have the space to say it – so a belated apology to all my the FTH:K’ers who might have felt like this in the past!! We live, we learn. I fear I am going to be one of those mothers who beats up the mum that makes dares to point out the flaws in her kid…

Hi! Okay, so I cheated on my stamp diet. I know, I'm so weak especially when there are so many cute stamps on my wish list. I bought my first Wryn and actually my first ever Tiddly Inks stamp. Wryn is so adorable that even though I'm not such a big fan of digis, I had to get at least one. So I decided to get Spring Bling cause I thought she would be a very versatile image great for any special occasion. I have to also thank Christy because she was so quick and friendly when I had problems getting my links to the digis. Great customer service!
Q014) What do you want right now?
In Our Homeschool This Week: Last week I was struggling with Tay during History. I am really considering making a change in this area next year, but have decided to stick with what I have for this year. I wanted to change things up for her a bit to make the subject of history more interesting and fun. Tay really likes the way the Apologia Science is formatted, so we now follow the same format for history. Her textbook is written as if it were a story. The chapters are short and at the end of each chapter there is a study summary, activities, and a study test. As we do we science, we read the history chapter as a read aloud. During the reading process I would stop and ask her some Tay a few questions. At the end of reading, the two of us went over the study summary orally together. Tay then chose an activity to do, which is usually some kind of art project. After all this was completed I had her complete the study test on her own. She really enjoyed this. I am planning on doing history this way for the rest of the year. Ash is now reading and spelling! So exciting. I am very pleased with her progress and am excited to see her more relaxed during reading time. She is still working on counting by 10's and addition as well as subtraction. We have been working on handwriting, which is a struggle for her because her hand tires so quickly. Buddy is coming along nicely. He is counting objects really well and we are going to start working on shapes this week. I am also putting together a unit for him on ocean life, which in not done yet, for the weeks to come.
When I was pregnant with Camden, I did a mammoth sort of all the baby clothing I’d saved from Beckett. It was a huge to-do and one of the biggest purges was all the polyester/polar-fleece stuff we had acquired. These included every single one of the blanket sleepers that Beckett had lived in for the first six months of life. I cleared the bins of anything that was soaked in flame-retardants or made of artificial materials. And, then I began the hunt for a sleepsack made from a natural fabric and came across CastleWare.
We split up just after Rathfarnham, Marcin heading back to his beautiful baby girl, Mr M to whatever it is that the childless do on a Sunday. I checked my clock and saw that I had plenty of time to shower, change pedals and have a little rewarmup before starting my spin at 12. It felt good to have done three hours and to still feel strong and ready for the rest of the day. I wished that i had made more use of the weather since I'd been back, made more of an effort to get out. I looked forward to the remaining warmish weeks and putting in some serious mileage. Glowing with all those good endorphins, I gave a little kick on the brief incline up to Orwell Road. I checked right as I approached the left hand turn. Clear, I would have called had I been with the boys. And then my hands came off the bars.

I have memories of being raped by them. Violently so. But also by objects inserted in me. While tying me up was simply a prevention of my escape for my uncle, ropes and restraints in that house were parts of the torture. The restraints made it possible for them to do things to me more freely. All though I think pinning me down with their hands was something they got an extra kick out of. They enjoyed feeling me struggle. At some point I must have stopped being a person for my uncle as well. Why else would he not prevent S from waterboarding me. Why else would he be ok with raping me while S made me believe I was being drowned. After all, he did nothing to prevent the torture from happening. Instead he kept raping me, holding me firmly so my body’s natural attempts to escape the endless stream of water, enjoying my body’s movements that increased his sexual enjoyment.

A few years ago, before I knew better, I got into an argument with someone over something that they’d taught publicly in a church setting. In the height of their exhortation and teaching, they exclaimed, “you got to go through it yourself to learn it!” Whew! While everyone else was “Amen”-ing and clapping, I sat in silence on that one statement. While there were many, many valid practical things the minister shared that night, that one thing caught my attention and consumed all of my focus for the rest of the weekend. Is it a reality that the only way that I can learn in life is that I have to experience the test myself? Can I learn from the mistakes of others? What about watching someone else fall in a ditch and not repeating that same mistake? What does the Bible have to say about all of this? Is life’s best teacher our own experiences?

Stref', or Stephen White, has previously worked on The Beano and The Dandy for DC Thomson and had an anthology of his black and white work, MILK, published in hardback by Insomnia Publications. With the collapse of Insomnia, Stref' updated MILK as MILK+ which is due to be released by Markosia who have already released a collection of his colour humour strips entitled Raising Amy, a Minnie The Minx character for the 21st century. However X is unlike anything else that Stref' has so far released and self-publishing the book allowed him to be as extreme with the plot and artwork as he wanted to be.

I’m not saying that we don’t need any communication or cooperation. But there’s a growing trend of an overemphasis in “team work”. Susan mentioned in her speech “madness of constant group work”. This is exactly what I have been through in my university. Admittedly, it does benefit me — it teaches me how to deal with difficult people and how to mitigate conflicts within a team. But we also need some space for contemplation in our lives. I object to economic courses adopting too many group presentations. The presentation method is essentially more suitable for the business context. By definition, it focuses more on how ideas are presented instead of how reasonable and deep the thinking behind is.
Time......sometimes I look in the mirror, and wonder "When did I get so old?" There are days I just feel my age in my bones. It seems like just yesterday I was in college the first time....or picking Chad up out of his crib. Where has it all gone?? How does it slip by so fast?? I guess if I had the answer to that, I would be a very rich woman. Doesn't keep me from asking though. This past weekend, Mike and I celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary! It has been a long 17 years, and we've had some good times as well as bad.....but I don't think I would trade them in for anything!

We had been having trouble with the black water (toilet) tank not flushing out properly and so I had the bright idea of dumping the black water tank, filling it up with fresh water, and then dumping the tank again to flush it out. I estimated that water flowed into the commode at 1.5 gallons per minute which meant it would take 26 minutes to fill up the 40 gallon holding tank. So we had 20+ minutes to do something, or just sit around. Well, we needed to get change to do laundry so we decided to walk to a nearby credit union, get cash from the ATM, ask a teller to make change, and then come back to the Trek. So off we went at a very brisk pace while I kept a careful eye on the time.
The Byzantine Emperor was appropriately enough named Constantine, the eleventh to bear that name; but he would be the last. He had prepared the city for the expected attack, and had organised large stores of arms, cleared the ditches, and repaired the walls. The citizens had worked to support their Emperor, stopping only for the Easter celebrations in Hagia Sophia (1 April). He had called upon allies for help but none was forthcoming, save seven hundred Genoese led by Giovanni Giustiniani Longo.

Claire and Megan are in their bedroom, tucked behind one of the doors leading from the lounge. The eight year gap in their ages brings a strange mix of cuddly toys and sparkly make-up to the mess that surrounds them. Charlie is sprawled on the sofa watching tv. In one corner of the lounge there's a huge open fireplace, piled up with the pine cones we've collected from the garden. In the opposite corner there's a small wooden staircase that leads to the boys' attic bedroom, and up there sits Ged playing on his Yamaha keyboard.

There never seems to be enough of it during the holidays, but these Saltine Toffees should help. With just four basic ingredients, they are a snap to make, leaving you time to read Christmas cards, watch a classic Yuletide movie or just put up your feet and relax. When they're ready, I guarantee that you'll find the time to indulge in their sweetness. But be warned: this combination of crisp crackers, buttery toffee and rich chocolate is so addictive, it's also known as Christmas Crack. And it just might stop the clock altogether.

As for the songs, there's not really any point in going through all of them one at a time, since for the most part they are done fairly similarly to the originals. Well, sort of - structurally and in essence, they're mostly the same as before, but there are enough changes to keep the songs sounding fresh this time around. "And You And I" receives the most noticable change - the quiet acoustic opening is replaced with an immediate display of the gargantuan "Eclipse" section, and while I'm not thrilled with that development, the track doesn't sound worse for it. But there are other subtlties - for instance, the opening section of "CTTE" is significantly reworked, with Howe playing faster and more aggressively than ever before.

If it’s not already obvious, part of the reason I left traditional media is that I was really frustrated at how my fellow journalists almost seemed to despise the Internet, while I’m basically in love with it.

Bix Beiderbecke is another early jazz musician that was not known very much in the public but he was highly admired by his fellow musicians. As far as trumpet/cornet rivals go, the only person who was on par with him was Louis Armstrong. It's a real pity that Bix died so early (in '31) because he would most definitely influence modern music in a much larger scope if he only had the time. Sadly alcohol and other various factors made him die young. But, for our consolation he left us a bit of his music behind so that we may grasp a bit of his great playing.
A few Sundays ago I spent an entire afternoon preparing my dinner. I braised a portobello mushroom. I roasted and mashed a sweet potato. I made a port wine reduction. I simmered a farro risotto in broth I made with dried porcinis and vegetable stock. Then I put it all together in dramatic, restaurant-esque fashion.
This metaphor could use some development. It doesn't account for the way writers participate in public language. All people, writers or not, are part root and part tree; we all use a combination of public and private speech. Without some sense of public language, the writer would be impossible to comprehend, even for an editor. Once Thoreau dreamed of creating a singular language, all for himself, but I fear that he could not have used it to communicate.

I know I had previously also mentioned that the little corner stand where I normally get my tree had sold out before I could get down there this year, leaving me facing a bit of a conundrum. I knew where another lot was that sold trees but they were expensive there and I could really use that $70-80 somewhere else right now; I am laid off. Plus, the trees had been shipped from quite a distance and did I really want to participate in that? I mean, I preach this buy local, buy local etc. all the time. Or perhaps, not buy at all? Shouldn't I practice what I preach? Of course, I should. This left me with really only one solution if I wanted a tree. Cut a local one and preferably from my own land. I mean, I do have about 18 acres. There are lots of trees on that much land.

Soups are perfect anytime of year, but especially during the winter months. I adapted this from River Cottage Veg Everyday.

Consider adding more spices, such as cayenne and cumin along with the tomatoes and hot peppers for an extra kick.
News Corp. shareholders aren’t necessarily pleased with the arrangement as the New York Post loses money by the tens of millions of dollars. But it exists as a platform for Murdoch’s extreme Right viewpoints and as a bully pulpit. A good example of the latter could be made out of the Post’s attitude toward Hillary Clinton. The paper for years consistently attacked Clinton in every manner possible, going out of its way to publish the most unflattering photos of her they could find, and sometimes doctoring them to make her look worse. (Fox News is often accused of doing that as well.) But in 2000, Clinton was a shoo-in to win a seat from New York in the U.S. Senate, and Murdoch thought it might be good to get on the good side of a powerful senator. Suddenly, Clinton was a hero, routinely lauded in the Post while her Republican opponent was mercilessly attacked. As soon as Clinton became a part of the Obama administration, she immediately reverted to her previous status.

Once you’ve adjusted your mindset to asking these types of questions you will begin to see how your brain will start working towards attaining them. It works every time and don’t be discouraged if you can’t seem to get the answers you seek right away. Some questions are more difficult to answer than others and sometimes you just have to keep asking over and over until you get the answers you want but one thing is for sure, if you keep asking, it’s only a matter of time before you get the answer.

Notes: To get 1.5kg of feijoas, you will need 2-3 kg of raw fruit, depending how bruised they are. They do say not to use bruised fruit for jam, to which I say - nonsense! Sure, don't use the actual bruised part, but just chop it off and use the good bit. Feijoas fall from the tree when they are ripe enough, and they often have a bruised portion if they land on hard surfaces like a concrete footpath. So here we see the upper one is brown and goopy - into the compost. Lower one, fine. Cut off bruised bit, at left.
As exhibited in New York’s Fashion Week, pastel colors are going to be huge this season, with mint being the most popular of this category.

Bonus: Mint pairs well with many colors, especially bright ones like teal, pink and yellow.

A few months ago I was contacted by a company that specializes in products for the preservation of weapons, ammunition as well as other metallic items prone to rusting. The company is Heritage Packaging company who markets the ZCorr line of scientifically designed storage bags. ZCorr manufactures several bag sizes.

In fact the US Marine Corps uses these products for transport and storage of ammunition, M16′s, M4′s etc. Operating in many cases around salt water environments this is especially important for the Corps.
I am very grateful to James Bradley and Daniel Lloyd for their generosity and courage. It must have been quite a leap of faith to 'cast out into the deep' by leaving the Anglican Communion to enter Pope Benedict XVI's newly erected Ordinariate - or, as Fr James has apparently and humorously put it: "Leaving the gatehouse to move into the manor house"! I am also very grateful to all those who have decided to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church whilst holding onto their Anglican patrimony by becoming members of the Ordinariate. These men, women and children, are ecclesiastical pioneers - leading the way on the path of real and lasting Christian unity. Thanks should also be given go to all those Catholics who have embraced the Holy Father's project by welcoming the Ordinariate into the wider Church. But, of course, none of this would have been possible without the extraordinarily wise, generous and prophetic vision of the Pope himself - for whose leadership it is right to cry out: Deo gratias!

I was a fan of Katherine Langrish's troll trilogy as soon as I started reading it two summers ago, but this revised edition is definitely something special and should bring her many new fans. For a start (and this is important in getting readers to pick up the book in the first place), the new cover is simply marvellous--icy and enticing, with just a hint of the stark landscapes inside the book. But of course, one shouldn't judge by appearances. What I was surprised by (and shouldn't have been, because I know how beautifully Katherine writes), was how well West of the Moon reads as one big book instead of three separate ones--how each part flows smoothly and seamlessly into the next.

Two nights ago my husband and I both had the same dream, we were watching our youngest daughter run! At the moment our twins are learning to walk. They are both happy to cruise around hanging onto furniture or holding our hands but not confident enough to let go and go off on their own, which personally is perfectly fine with me as I don't know what I am going to do when I have two little people running off in totally different directions!! Something they already like to do, one holding each hand pulling me in opposite directions. The day after having this dream Aaliyah took 9 whole steps on her own! All be them a little wobbly, a surfing moment at step number 5 before regaining her balance for the next 4 steps. I was loudly cheering her on for every step of the way and deafening my best friend who was currently on the phone with me listening as I yelled out each step.

Many girls and boys approach matrimony with blinkers on. There is nothing like “it will never happen to me”. Anything can happen, anytime. We just need to keep our eyes and ears open and no one dare to fool us. Nevertheless, marriage fraud has disheartened, saddened, depressed and dejected many. How can one avoid getting duped in the marriage market? Marriage market being huge comes with its own set of deceptions and cons for some and a plain simple bad luck for many. Many men and women, looking for love, life and stability fall into the web of crimes adorning this pious institution – like marrying for an immigration or permanent citizenship of another country, marrying for money and sometimes marrying just under pressure.

The success of a designer or architect greatly depends on how well they can follow these key benefits to design. Good design can improve the quality of ours lives and can save time and money. With good window placement, siding, insulation it could save on energy and could keep you warm when it’s needed and cool when that is needed. The use of industrial materials or recycled materials can help simplify use and have clean maintenance. Now that I know about these designer tips I will definitely try to incorporate them into my house plans and home designs.
You have clearly taught that to become a spiritual master one needs an order from his predecessor acarya. This rule of needing authorization to become a guru from the predecessor guru is the only protection against a misjudgment by oneself or other conditional souls as to the qualification of a soul for rendering such a grave service to the guru parampara. Assessment of conditioned souls or self assessment to qualify for that service, without a specific order, is a road guaranteed to lead to the sahajiya trap, even if it is well intended by some among them.

October 5 – Westminster Abbey, what an incredible place to visit. We paid the fee for the little hand held phones that give you the audio tour, and I definitely suggest getting it. We spent a lot of time there reading the engravings. We also went to Covent Garden, where I shopped at Lush…I bought ballistics, soaps, shampoos, deodarants, and lots of gifts, I had 3 huge shopping bags of Lush items, so we went back to the hotel. We took it easy and wandered around our area, and had lunch at La Bouchee, a French restaurant in So. Kensington, where the food was definitely delicious, reasonably priced, and the service was excellent. My son and I went to Bloomsbury that evening and had dinner at Malibar Junction on Great Russell Street, approximately 1 block from the British Museum. That is our favorite restaurant, the price is perfect, the service is excellent, and if you like Indian food, it is the best we have had yet! After dinner my son and I wandered around Oxford Street, window shopping and stopping for some coffee before going back to our hotel.
To find out why this experiment would ever be done, I will explain to you one explanation of the “one photon acts like a lot of photons” experiment that I talked about last time. The leading interpretation at the moment is that when something happens, say, a photon goes through a slit, or a radioactive atom decays, or you decide not to use conditioner in the shower, all of the possible outcomes are achieved with their respective wave functions, and these happen in different universes. What is interesting is that when something like Schrödinger’s cat happens, there is one universe in the multiverse where the cat dies almost instantaneously, and another universe where the cat does not die at all, and this happens with everything that happens in the universe, and other universes, and more universes. What this conjures up in my mind almost instantly in a tree, and I think it helps describe this well.

Anyway, to thank sweet Katie, I thought I would try a dish from my brand new cookbook, and share it with you. I really made very few changes in the recipe, with only two exceptions.

Now, if you HAVE a beautiful free range chicken, I have no doubt it would do nothing BUT enhance this already delicious recipe, so by all means, use a free range chicken if you can.

There is no overhead lighting in the bedrooms here, so we need lots of lamps. A lamp next to each bunk bed gives off just enough light for reading stories in bed, right before the lights are turned out for the night. Which apparently is their signal to talk and laugh for the next two hours. Oh serenity now.

“Sec. Chu dismissed numerous warning signs that the LGP was a ticking time bomb,” said CAGW President Tom Schatz. “The dramatic program expansion in 2009 and the continued funneling of taxpayer dollars toward poor investments reeks of poor management and crony capitalism, since Solyndra’s major investors were among the President’s largest campaign donors. If this is the Obama administration’s idea of how America can ‘invest’ in its economic recovery, taxpayers would much rather keep the money and do it themselves.”
That's not true, there are no blood and guts in this story. Granted, my blood and guts where all over the place, but I couldn't see and have no photographic evidence of said blood and guts. Well, maybe a little. But dude, it's a birth story. Can you have a birth story without blood and guts and a bit of nudity? Fair warning.

Friday morning. Holiday from work YAY. Was at the barn by 7:30 to unwrap the pony, rub on some surpass, clean his stall, and put him back in the little paddock. Apparently he was well behaved because he was still in the paddock when I returned around 4:30 to hose/walk/wrap/dose with meds for the evening. His leg is tight and there's very little heat remaining.

Prior to the 20th Century, the Huguenots and before them the Normans, who once again are part of the same ethnic and cultural groupings as the British people were the only people from across the channel to settle in Britain in any significant numbers in the last thousand years, yet, in terms of numbers percentage of the population they bore no comparison to what is occurring today.
Sleeve notes from Newell:
To think that something/-body that immense cares or even pays attention to us is pride at its worst.
A friend recently proposed an interesting exercise in hypothetical course design where one must select a single American novel for each decade of the 20th century to create a teachable arc for the century (and justify said choices). Given my own interest in genre, I figured I’d adopt/adapt it for utopian/dystopian fiction (dropping the “American” requirement) to see what kind of survey of the genre I might teach (and what works I’d be willing to drop per only having one choice per decade). The difficult part about conceptualizing this as an actual course is there is no way I would be able to teach this without starting with More’s Utopia and some other relevant earlier texts (Campanella? Bellamy and Morris? Wells? etc.) or doing a bunch of work up front introducing literary utopias via describing those works that lead up to what is really the dystopian turn in the genre that takes place at the beginning of the 20th century. Not that I couldn’t do the latter, but I’d much rather have students at least read More to begin.
I'm not. It was fantastic. I think the next time we go (!) it won't be like that. It was just the juxtaposition of the extreme joy that comes from watching three of your children see the castle and the mouse and the awesomeness of it for the first time and the extreme sorrow that comes from knowing that you're only able to afford letting them do that right now because two of your children are dead.
There were some blanched almonds in the freezer, an orange and celery in the fridge...sultanas, onions and couscous in the pantry. Plus fresh herbs from the garden.
It was the space invaders meets underwater world. Everything was shiny chrome or white, but there were lanterns in the shape of octopus and squid suspended from the ceiling. There was also a preponderance of really young, probably filthy rich, Chinese kids. Most of them couldn’t have been more than 17. And everyone was drinking whisky green tea served with a platter of artfully arranged sliced fruit. Love it. The service, however, was slow. The staff don’t really speak very much English, so it was difficult ordering a gin&tonic and a vodka martini, and it all took aaaaaaaaages to come.

Sander presents us with utilitarian workwear, in honest, no-nonsense colours and fabrics. However, far from suggesting itself as a modern and clever uniform for daytime, as seen recently at Chloe and Celine, Uniqlo’s latest offering is surely too drab, sparse and insipid to constitute anyone’s wardrobe of choice?
To be honest, this one doesn’t really creep me out, but I do think it’s bizarre. Hatsune Miku is 5ft 2, looks to be about 16 years of age, and plays sold-out concerts. She is one of Japan’s top-selling entertainers. She sings, she dances, and she’s just so darn cute…all looking like an anime character and stuff. Oh wait…did I forget to mention that she’s a hologram? And that she sings via software from Vocaloid?
According to the statistics, they approximately average attendances of a mere 80 for home games. Bognor Regis Town, who they pipped to the title on goal difference, were getting 1,300-ish at the end of the season. Which doesn’t seem very utilitarian… or even meritocratic.

He says there's no way they could've been that far off if all of the votes had been counted. He also asserts that exit polls varied by beyond-error margins in 10 states, something that hasn't happened since 1948 when modern exit polling began.

I like being able to listen to my own music, and you can choose between three different voices to cue you when to run and when to walk. You can also set it to record your route via GPS, but I use my Garmin Forerunner when running outside, so I don’t need to use the app’s GPS function (which saves the battery).

When I was about 5, I started getting stomach-aches pretty regularly, so I was sent to my first psychiatrist. I don’t blame my mom. Who knows what to do? But, who goes to a psychiatrist age 5? ME. Aren’t you paying attention? I did like that particular doctor so I started baking cookies, calling them “Mike’s Delights” and selling them to him for $5/bag. Hey, he was charging my mom like $75-90/hr. But, I did learn an important lesson. Doctorate or not, everyone is susceptible to getting distracted, if approached the right way.

In this busy group, it seems that calming is on the last of the history of every personal. Every day, there’s always a need to execute. Our techniques and ideas get tired while we neglect that we also need to relax. Rest is one of the best kinds of relax. But it can get better if before you do that, you’ll get a rub. The best feeling on the world is offered by those caressing hands, forcing through our muscular large, offering the tiredness out of us. Then after that, you are now definitely able to get losing in your dreams. And when you wake up, you will see yourself in a different way of level of energy. You need to a lot a personal for this, but if you can’t, you can still get a rub all alone with yourself.
As much of this work is stitched in silk, I decided I would also use silk thread and I really enjoy stitching with Maderia silk thread, There was an exhibition a little away in the future and I made my plan to stitch this project for it, however before I could even go shopping for the colours I had decided on I had a major health scare, and this greatly changed my plans. The result was that I only stitched the top sunflower.

Whatever happened to standard names like Jim and Paul and Max? What the hell were these people thinking? Just because it rhymes with a real name, doesn’t make it a real name, and certainly doesn’t give you the right to use it to just invent sucky names.

Until we come to terms with this and call a spade a spade our denial will cause this sort of thing to happen.

One of the reasons I continue to maintain this blog is because it forces me to intentionally look at my everyday life. And to be thankful all the tiny pieces that make up its existence – the happy, the sad, the sweet, the salty and even the utterly mundane. Nobody said it’s easy but if you want to embrace life, you’ve just gotta savour, relish and celebrate every single minute of it.
And then we get: ‘If you are not the right person to deal with this letter please tell us and pass the letter on to someone who is.’ His Grace is minded to respond that inflicting such an inquisition on an already appallingly-persecuted long-dead archbishop is perhaps not appropriate. He could then ‘pass the letter on to someone’ he thinks might be the ‘right person’, wondering for how long he might string this out...

Ugh, it is so not fun to watch your little one be sick. Especially when you can’t do anything about it. His fever did break before we went to bed and I thought we were in the clear. Until I checked his temp the next day and it was 99.6. Luckily he hadn’t lost his appetite at all but I did end up calling a nurse triage line when his temp rose to 100 (this was over the weekend when the doc’s office was closed) and had a nurse reassure me that I was doing everything I could for K. His fever broke again that night but he kept waking up every 2 hours because his nose was so clogged he was having a hard time breathing. Even though we were using saline to clear his nose, it seemed to just clog the second we laid him on his back. He sleeps in a pack-n-play right now so we couldn’t elevate his head at all. Eventually I just decided to sleep with him on my chest with me elevated on the couch. I made sure to breathe away from his face which meant sleeping in a super awkward position. But hey, the kink in my neck was totally worth it since K ended up sleeping all night because he could finally breathe easily. I had to sleep on the couch with him again last night so he could breathe but at least his fever has not returned. Hopefully this just means the infection he was fighting is gone and the mucous just needs to subside for his cough and squeaky breathing to go too. But hey! At least all of these late night wakings have lead to me reading the Hunger Games trilogy.

Making me the luckiest
The world of Mimi … this Bread Bite is huge, sprinkled with a lot of seasoning! To share every speck of parmesan would require the writing of a book all of its own entitled Cole Michael. The fun, the laughter, the non-stop chatter, the busyness, the curiosity, the tenderness, the stubbornness, the love, and even occasional frustration … Need I go on? With every effort to do all we can to help lighten the load for his parents, Papaw and Mimi have had Cole at their house as often as possible, or Mimi has spent weekends in Baltimore. Cole’s world continues to be all boy – cars, tractors, stickers, balls, and monster trucks. Despite the unusually warm temperatures this winter, we were truly blessed with a few inches of snow during an overnight visit from Kim and Cole. A year makes such a difference in the fun of a little boy … he graduated from his protective and safe little sled to the adult long board, which allowed him to self-spill and tumble out into the snow. Cole is very excited and shares in the anticipation of Baby Lillie … not quite sure what he is expecting, although the details of tiny, crying, pooping, and sleeping have all been explained to him. For the moment, Baby Lillie is the existence behind Momma’s ever-growing belly, which he kisses, includes in his prayers, and enjoys her company as he raises momma’s maternity top up so she can also watch the CAR movie with him…the preciousness of a little child.

And then another unhinged female personality by the name of Gofra Schvulkopf, a frigid TV chef who gets high on potpourri, dresses like “Minoy Spok circa 1966”, advocates taking “laxatives and amphetamines” and is perpetually in an “ever expanding campaign for publicity”. She resides on Mars away from all the Middle Earf Hampton bitches, draws inspiration from Blue Green Planet – which makes her feel like she wants to “get fucked by a suicide bomber” on top of a refuse midden in Staten Island - and has aspirations to set-up a urine-lemonade stand and go into manufacture of pumpkin toilets. The characters, and there are several others among the faeces-obsessed kinfolk, are a barbed metaphor for our own skewed values, just as “Hideous Exuberance” is a mishmash of satire and commentary on post-millennia (American) culture written in finely-honed derisive jargon. The novel holds up to scrutiny the absurdities of modern day life by employing reductio ad absurdum and pronounced exaggeration of stereotypes and cultural customs. Bird demonstrates, with considerable humour, that at the core of almost every institution, every deed and thought, rests moral relativism and a fine mound of SHIT. This, in turn, is portrayed through droll, absurdist hodgepodge sketches of life in a subverted reality and once the plot gets going the story takes on the form of derangement, jumping along from foray to foray in an orderly chaos of needling intensity.
We are taught to expend all our energies and direct our collective attention towards those who would destroy our "sacred" constitution, those who run the federal reserve, those who have corrupted our political offices and run amok world wide, those who violate our borders, evils ad nauseum. Many "saviours" are put forth - Ron Paul, state secession, gold, re-election of any of a number of politicians, war in the streets. But not one of these identify the core problem, how to address it and our only solution. The federal reserve is NOT the problem. Neither is the alien or the jew. It's not the greed of the elites or those of our own who have sold out. These are all merely symptoms of a deeper rot. Our greatest hindrance is ourselves.

Probably the only thing more fun than shopping for or creating gift baskets is receiving one. Several years ago I received this huge basket of the most incredible English muffins. Thick, exquisite muffins in every possible flavor. Needless to say I shared my bounty – and the next year went to the site and ordered several baskets for folks on my list. Another basket that really impressed me was the one our realtor sent after we bought a house. It had all the fixings for an intimate housewarming party, including a lovely bottle of wine.

There’s a post at MTV.com on scenes that were cut that were missed by fans of the novel, and as a fan I can sort of agree with them. However, I don’t think all those scenes, such as that with Peeta’s dad and Katniss after the Reaping, are at all necessary to the film. I’m fine with alterations and abridgments unless they really change a character or the plot. I certainly don’t mind the shift in the origin of the Mockingjay pin (and writing out Madge) or the omission of Katniss’ story about Prim’s goat. There are, however, a few that did feel like mistakes:
“Billy, you wanna go first? After all she is your date.” Paul said as he took another shot of whiskey. “You’re ten percent smarter than that bottle you’re holding, Paul.” Billy replied. Then he unbuckled his pants and crawled on top of Casey’s rag doll-like body. “Why are you doing this?” Casey asked him with tears running down her face. For some strange reason Billy wanted to try to assure Casey that she was going to be ok. “Don’t worry. It won’t hurt and everythin’ll be back to normal in the morning.” Billy said. “Please don’t do this.” Casey pleaded. She gazed into his eyes and whispered, “I’m begging you, Billy. Please don’t do this!” Billy’s heart-felt no desire to stop the planned events from happening. “Shh” Billy replied as he put his finger to her lips. “This won’t take long. I promise.” Billy forced himself inside her and took her virginity. As he promised, it was over quickly. Billy eased himself off of Casey, he zipped up his ragged jeans, kissed her on the forehead, and yelled “Next!”

I am also getting a very maternal sense of the ‘divine feminine’ coming through with Mother Mary and Mary Magdaline, again reiterating, revealing, and unveiling the sense of duality of the ‘self’ in relation and ones image and perception. What I am getting is that the societal facade views, expectations and identity crisis of modern society will be challenged and peeled away as we reveal a more naked feminine truth connected to the heart of Gaia. I feel that keys are being given to open new doors. This is a long awaited, pre-destined time and harks back to connections from ‘Jesus times’. I feel that secret societies of the Light are there behind the scenes, amongst etheric beings of light in dimensions above us such as ascended masters and the angelic realm.

Of all of the life-changing moments we experienced in Uganda, the most memorable were those spent working at the orphanage in Kampala. We decided long before we ever purchased our tickets to Africa that we couldn’t possibly travel there without giving something back. We looked into several different volunteer organizations, but they did not fit into our tight little budget. Besides, we already had a place to stay and transportation so we didn’t need most of what the organizations offer and charge for. Feeling discouraged and not knowing what the heck we should do, we stumbled upon an orphanage in Kampala. I emailed the woman in charge, filled out some paperwork and then showed up. Easy peasy. Before we left we gathered two huge suitcases full of goodies for the babies stocked with wipes, soy formula, baby Tylenol, and some miscellaneous toys and books. As we dropped all of that off at the office on our first day, I felt an inner sense of fuzzy goodness. You know the one, when you feel like you just made a difference in the world? Well, that feeling and naivete quickly vanished.

“Howdy,” I replied, sizing myself up. This other me was a squeaky clean looking fellow. Sharp-dressed too, with some shiny jewels at his cuffs and fingers.

Sat: Long run with the Gypsy Runner. We went to try out the course for the Tilden Tough Ten — the same route that I ran 2 weeks ago. We meant to run all 10 miles, but it was a hot day and we got a little lost, so we cut the run short. Not to make any excuses, but the stats below don’t really reflect that I ran this route faster than last time, if you take out the 0.4 miles where we were wandering around lost on rough trails before we decided to turn around.

As I have said, these issues have to be addressed within the next two months, before the political scene hots up again at the end of September. We cannot allow them fester any longer, because they are pulling this Party apart from top to bottom. When they have been resolved, I will resume my position as a BNP representative of the GLA. Until that time, my position will technically remain as independent, but rest assured that my political views have not changed.

Seriously--this is yet another example of what I wrote about in my recent blog post on book marketing methods that don't work.

The $5.5-billion proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline would cross 1,000 rivers and streams, including the Fraser and Skeena headwaters. Supertankers, with capacity of up to two million barrels of oil, would criss-cross along coastal waters. The 1,172-kilometre pipeline would also impact the Great Bear Rainforest, one of the last intact temperate coastal rain forests on our planet and the only home to the rare spirit bear. Enbridge has reported a total of 610 spills between 1999 and 2008 from its various projects. The proposed pipeline traverses the territories of 65 first nations, of which at least 61 have declared their opposition. “http://www.vancouversun.com/news/canada-in-afghanistan/Enbridge+pipeline+distortions/6016517/story.html

If evolution is the objective of Mass Effect 3, then it is actually stated incredibly poorly. A deep, thoughtful analysis of 2001 is confronted with the Monolith from the very beginning--our australopithecus ancestors are gently pushed by the Monolith on their first steps toward critical thought and creative problem-solving, the very elements that make us human. It is poignant that homicide is one of the side-effects of this. The desolation of Africa, bereft of cities or development, is displaced by a ballet of orbital stations and spacecraft as humanity has achieved the ultimate zenith of homo sapiens' potential. Into this milieu the Monolith re-emerges, this time on the Moon, and beckons our curious selves to evolve into the next step.

It is hard to believe, unless, you realize that the enemy is the most subtle of all creatures. Toy stores are for toys, not hidden agendas! Toys R Us is one of the last toy stores out there besides big box stores with a toy section! Is nothing sacred? It shows us very clearly that there are people in this wicked world more committed, and more passionate about having their voices heard. We are the church CANNOT stand by and watch these things happen. We are his hands and his feet, we are the voice of one crying in the wilderness of sin, to make straight the way of the Lord. You are the church, the ones God has chosen to be the voice of truth before His second coming! We must redeem the time for the days are evil, and the enemy relentless in his pursuit to see the lost never recovered, and it is still the hope of our redeemer that ‘none should perish’.

Once upon a time, there were two poets. For the sake of anonymity, we will call one Emily and the other Sylvia. They were both extremely good writers - modern yet accessible, challenging yet mellifluous, edgy yet musical. They each kept a wary professional eye on the other’s successes and failures. Because they were decent human beings, they tried to rejoice at the former and not to rejoice at the latter. Sometimes they managed this better than other times, but still, they tried.

Also, as if all that wasn’t fun enough, for the first two days pretty much all I heard about was Thrall and how proud she is of him for saving the world from Deathwing and how great it is that he and Aggra are having a baby and by the way WHEN THE HELL WAS THRALL GOING TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT?! First the wedding and now this, the FUCK, man? And anyway, that was all kinds of fun, being reminded on and on about how awesome Thrall is, and how happy she is that she’s finally going to have great-grandchildren. And then she made some mention about how apparently Kilrath has a daughter around my age that she wants me to meet, and yeah that was all kinds of awkward. Ugh.
A secret and assuréd friend unto the Montague.

An expert in English Civil Law, he was often called upon to advise the Privy Council on legal matters, and later would serve for a time as Her Majesty's Principal Secretary.

As for the actual creation of my portfolio the daytime images were simple enough, with little else being required of me other than a slight tweaking of the colours afterwards to compensate for the poor weather. For the nighttime pictures however I had to greatly increase the exposure, and even then many of the images were unusable. Despite this, once I had a suitable image the colour and all else were generally ok before editing.

I do not have time here to go into detail regarding the behaviour of the Duke administration, or of the Durham NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured people) and the inaccurate, misleading and guilt alleging statement regarding the case on their website. The patently false information put out by the Durham Crime Stoppers group, stating incorrectly that there was strong evidence of rape, and also creating a myth, which was to continue throughout the case that the players were refusing to cooperate. Meanwhile an analysis of the false rumours, originating from at least one nurse, Tara Levicy, at Duke hospital that the accuser had sustained serious vaginal and anal injuries, whereas only a mild swelling and some evidence of thrush had been detected, would require a deeper investigation into pure human malice and the radical feminist mindset than I am inclined to go at this time. For those who wish to read more about these, I have listed a variety of sources at the bottom of this posting where further details of these can be found.

As a surprise bonus you get a side of season vegetables, dahl, and a green dipping sauce for the chicken.

After 15 minutes of socializing, we began the evening's program with a PowerPoint presentation by Bill Dietrich on the basics of extract brewing. Despite the experiences of the many people present, all of us walked away with some new things to think about. That's one of the nice things about brewing - just about every step can be done different ways, and there's a lot of room for personal preference (except, as Bill noted, sanitation ... all of us have to do that step!). It was a great talk. On behalf of the rest of the group, many thanks to Bill for his presentation. And, thanks to Erick Lauber for providing/setting up/running the laptop & digital projector on the Coney's screen.

The title track is just plain weird, with Marcos's out-of-breath 'ha ha' sounding completely bizarre in one of his brother's stranger lyrics concoctions of urban dislocation, ambition, alienation. Musically it's infectiously punchy in a soft painted-velvet arrangement of drums grooving in the left channel, utterly unhurried and laid-back; Dom Salvador laying down percussive bursts of organ and swells of Hammond vibrato at the end of certain measures; breaks at the ends of the chorus where suddenly flutes and violins sneak their way. Then a verse of Marcos singing scatlike nonsense syllables. Once again, sonically it is a pastiche of elements that probably shouldn't be thrown together and yet couldn't sound more natural (and, once again, Paulo Sérgio manages a lyrical mimesis). The alternate version here, at a faster tempo and in different key, sheds light on the creative process and makes me even more impressed with the final version. Its not that the two are terribly different in structure or execution, but the album take is much more "in the pocket."

Another source of harmful chemicals is found in the modern man’s water supplies and soft drinks. As of 2002, the CDC statistics show that almost 60% of the U.S. population receives fluoridated water through the taps in their homes. The official reason for the presence of fluoride in our tap water? It prevents tooth decay. Ok … really? Is this mildly important benefit worth the consuming of great amounts of this substance by the population? Some studies even denied the dental benefits of fluorided water.

After moving in, the breakfast room sat empty while I struggled to find the perfect table for the space. Because our kitchen counters are marble and we have to be careful with them, and our formal dining room table, is, well more formal, I wanted a kitchen table that was a little rustic and did not feel precious. With a baby, and lots of family and friends hanging out (especially now with football season) I didn’t want to have to worry about the table getting damaged or have our guests feeling like they had to be uptight about setting a drink down.

I am repulsed by the notion that this would, or could, work on ANYONE.

Today, Monday the 12, I have returned from my doctor. I have had full blood tests, full physical and every lab they can come up to be sure I have no trace of cancer anywhere. My hormones were a huge question the testosterone is under 120 and a nonexistent prostrate was found ( no chance of cancer there). Normal total testosterone levels range from 300 - 1000 ng/dL. I had also a chromosome test and it states my results are 47,XXY which is Klinefelter syndrome.

But, as was seen with Mrs Duffy's intervention against Gordon Brown, at periods of high unemployment, this can lead to these workers being scapegoated for the problems of Capitalism. It also means that the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory Party, under pressure from UKIP and the BNP, can exert additional influence on the Party, pushing it further in the direction of the interests of the nationalistic small capitalists, and the reactionary petit-bourgeois. For Big Capital, whose agenda is for the creation of a Federal Europe, with open borders, the free flow of Capital and Labour, for the establishment of a central state, with control over fiscal and monetary policy etc. This is the opposite of the direction of travel they require. Once again, the attempts by Capital to “Make the Workers Pay” are riddled with contradiction, which ensure that it suffers itself as a consequence of such measures. That is not surprising given Marx's analysis of Capital as a social relation. Who says Wage Labour also says Capital, just as who says Capital also says Wage Labour. These are not in reality two distinct things, but as Marx makes clear, merely aspects of the same thing. Capital cannot make Labour pay without imposing costs on itself as a consequence, just as Labour cannot make Capital pay without imposing costs upon itself.

I’m just going to say it now, I loved The Stooges growing up. I always would sit down on the couch late at night, turn on TV Land or whatever station was playing them and just sit back and laugh my ass off. That said, I was not a huge fan of this movie. Where I think this film hit its problems with even before it was made, was that the film sets these guys in the 21st century, when all of their material was made around the 20′s, 30′s, and 40′s. This means a lot of the comedy that was so fresh, hilarious, and ground-breaking back in those days, may come off as a bit dated and too slap-sticky for some people’s tastes, which is exactly what happens. The Three Stooges have had their own time in comedy history where you can watch any episode of theirs, and you can find something new to laugh at even if it just Moe hitting Larry over the head with a hammer. However, placing them in a time where stuff like this is usually a lame way of getting laughs, definitely makes it a big stretch.
Canadians don't understand why even elderly ladies in South Africa carry condoms in their handbags. It may just safeguard them against AIDS during a rape. (50% of women in South Africa can expect to be raped at least once in their lifetime). Canadians don't know about the constant fear of being high-jacked, the worry when night falls. Even fortified rape gates between bedrooms and the rest of the house don't always help. Infra-red beams, alarms, burglar bars, security patrols have all proved to be insufficient.
Honestly, I really need Photoshop back! I am so fed up with not being able to edit my pictures properly. This one took hours of fiddling with 2 online programs. If only I could remember which box I packed Photoshop in back in November.... probably one of the pile still taped up in the spare room! Oh well, it's another project for the Easter break :o)

The illustrator Thomas Bewick (1758-1828) is buried in the churchyard at Ovingham. He went to school at the vicarage in the village. Although he is best known for his illustrations of wildlife, some of Bewick’s illustrations show daily life in the village in the late 18th century. This includes dye workers and boys playing in the churchyard.

As we were in an explosive chant with three powerful mrdanga drums, two dignitaries came in. They were representatives of a political party. They were not really prepared to join in on our ecstasy. So be it! The one gentleman, who was a white Canadian, began his address to the attendees once we completed our kirtan. All was quiet and all were sober (from the intoxication of kirtan). He opened with, "Namaste, Namaskaram, Kamcho, Vanakum, and any other words I missed."
What happens in the film? In the 2002 film, Fernand Mondego betrays Edmond Dantès because he wants to knock boots with his misses, Mercedes. Imprisoned in the Chateau d’If, he befriends the Abbé Faria, who teaches him how to obtain the treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. After Faria dies and Dantès escapes, he acquires the treasure and returns to society to seek his revenge, as the Count of Monte Cristo. However, Mercedes’ marriage to Fernand is a sham, and she still loves Dantès. He then completes his revenge by killing Fernand. Everyone is happy as everything played out accordingly.

When I moved to Pakistan and seeing how corrupt the government is, I realized how important it is to be aware of politics. Here in America I would say I am a Democrat. Every person regardless of age, sex, everyone has to be engaged in politics, it is our responsibility to use our rights and to fight for honesty, and equality. We have to raise our voice. We have to fight for the right path! As she speaks with great passion.
End political correctness now!
Next was the ethereal Arielle Dombasle, a frequent talk-show guest and wife of Bernard-Henri Levy. She looked impossibly thin and iridescent. In person, she seemed almost non-existent physically -- ghostlike, a vanishing Cheshire Cat with plumped lips. Her co-guests were Edouard Baer and the cast of Looking for Mr. Castang, who were boisterous and funny, funny, funny! Theirs is a show I'll definitely want to see.

All the individual panels are my favorite of the bag, though it was hard to pick "favorites" per say. They just turned out more like the picture I had in my head I guess. This bag is a good example of what I plan on selling in my etsy shop once I'm done with school - it's just a bit too time consuming making these to try to open up shop right now...but April isn't too far away!! *runs away to resume stitching madly!*
Ok so back to the labour - After Keiko came at 10am the contractions were starting to build slowly. I kept going between laying on the sofa, lying in the bath and bouncing on my birthing ball (like a gym/medicine/swiss ball - another thing I highly recommend). Nothing much was happening. I’d been doing pregnancy yoga for 4 weeks with Maxine Levy in Golders Green so I was well prepared with my breathing exercises. It made all the difference and the contractions werent really painful in the beginning.

The stories are short, fun and well-written with cute illustrations. Each teaches a lesson in a subtle but effective way. I like that the child is not preached to but is allowed to make decisions about what they would do in the situations Katie Woo finds herself in - situations that most young children experience.

we couldn't believe how beautiful it was. in my book, this is definitely comparable to the grand canyon. we just had to sit there in wonder and thank our god for creating such beauty and letting us see it!
In light of all this, my poem is a memorial for the Gulf Oil Disaster. It’s a disaster that continues today because the same practices causing it are in place. Its affect on the people of Louisiana, its economy, and wildlife, are all but forgotten by the President who proclaims “significant progress” has happened. I don’t see that if you consider that according to a court clerk, 62,000 forms are now filed against BP by business owners, rigworkers, and family members of men killed in the Deepwater Horizon blast.
I thought since I was having such success with the gentlemen commanding the center. I would try my luck and ask some questions about spraying. When I asked about the trails being left behind by the multiple aircraft flying overhead. They came off as speechless. Unable to or unwilling to answer questions. The conversation went from friendly to impersonal. They began saying that i would have to call and get clearance. That my questions were to be submitted to media relations. Either they were afraid to answer or had no answers. Right away based on their reaction it would be correct to assume something is going on.

Sometimes, it’s the supporting cast who makes a book complete. In A Deeper Darkness, that happens on Page 69, where Detective Darren Fletcher steals the show, as he is wont to do. Fletch is a dark character, prone to melancholy, a cop who’s seen too much, made too many mistakes, and just wants out. He’s also rather interested in Dr. Samantha Owens, and she is drawn to him as well. They mirror each other’s hurt, though they are most likely destined to be friends. On page 69 of A Deeper Darkness, Fletch and his partner, Lonnie Hart, are on their way to do a notification, a terrible experience for all cops. He’s thinking of his own lost family, alive, but strangers to him. This exchange is truly indicative of the partner’s dynamic. It is from Fletcher’s point of view, and speaks loads about the characters.His ex wouldn’t speak to him outside of the grunted hello if they accidentally saw each other during their infrequent child exchanges. And now that Tad could drive, Felicia never came near him. She hated him with a passion.

As I mentioned at the beginning, many things in the book are true to history. To cover all bases, I double checked to see if Victor’s daughter (Dède) really did move to Halifax, pretending to be married and becoming obsessed with a man to the point that she followed him wearing men’s clothing. This, in fact, was also true. The source to this answer was found from the Halifax Public Library website. To read about it, click here.

Based on my half marathon time from the 2011 Heart Mini Marathon, 2:04:16, RLRF predicts that I would run a 5K in 26:50 and that I should use the track repeat times associated with a 26:50 5K. I tried running the intervals at the suggested paces and nearly killed myself. Instead, I’m using the paces associated with a 28:00 5K (2:09:47 half and 4:32:28 full marathon):

I don’t want to spoil the plot so I’ll end here. To summarise, Avengers Assemble is good, but not great. Worth a watch, and probably appreciated by action-fans a lot more than sensitive-souls like myself, who like to feel a bit of empathy towards the characters as they run around killing the bad guys.
This is not the photo that will be used in the article but instead is one of the outtakes.

Last week, Emmanuel Nganou Djoumess, Minister for Economy, Planning and Regional development announced a master plan to boost trade and economic growth in the country by 2020/2035. The plan, to expand the network to its neighboring countries and its new harbor itself is not as spectacular as the dimensions in terms of price and length that have been announced. With a price tag of 22bn EUR (ca. 15000bn FCFA) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201202080917.html) this project is not cheap considering that Cameroon has at the moment an estimated GDP of 18bn Euros. So why is the government planning such an investment and what is it all about?
The audience was shaken. We had sat down as geeks, listening to Jonathan Coulton sing "Welcome to my Secret Lair on Skullcrusher Mountain" and got up a little more humbled, a little more chastened, a little more aware, as theater volunteers passed out lists of action points as we quietly exited (Item one - drop Steve Jobs a line). We had come expecting Martin Luther to tear the Catholic church a new one and ended up finding our own sins examined.

These were very easy to draft. I cut through the front dart to make a princess seam pant. Then I chopped it to make the pant, angling it down about 1 1/2 inches to the side. Because the opening is on the bias, I used fusible stay tape to stabilize. There are definitely more of these in my future. I'm thinking they will be cute in a light weight denim.
Baby and I had our 20 week ultrasound this morning. My midwife sent me to a perinatologist whom she works closely with. They have a wonderful, respectful professional relationship and it was a joy to be treated with the same respect.
I laid a skirt (that I liked the length on) on the pants, with waistbands together. You could also try them on & just cut off a couple inches below where you want the hem.
Jonsi: It does have a lot more electronic pieces than our other albums, although I think this has more to do with us enjoying playing around and experimenting with new gadgets than anything else. Whenever we discover a new instrument or tool it's really exciting for us.

Traditional Marxism, of course, aspired to the same ultimate goal but there was a key difference. Most Marxists insisted that it was necessary first to seize state power, and all the mechanisms of bureaucratic violence that come with it, and use them to transform society – to the point where, they argued such mechanisms would, ultimately, become redundant and fade away. Even back in the 19th century, anarchists argued that this was a pipe dream. One cannot, they argued, create peace by training for war, equality by creating top-down chains of command, or, for that matter, human happiness by becoming grim joyless revolutionaries who sacrifice all personal self-realisation or self-fulfillment to the cause.

The particular Finnish Cross Country Ski Team is precisely why Polar decided to produce their very first heart rate monitor. Nevertheless, you don’t have to be a member of some team to acquire this technology these days. You can purchase this specific watch/monitor from Amazon for only $102. Something you will find is that you will additionally not have to pay for the shipping as Amazon will cover that for you. One other thing which i should point out about purchasing this through Amazon is that you will additionally be saving 40% off the list price of this device. Meaning that in total you are saving $67.95 off what you would have to pay for this at a retail store.

Those who most want to learn, those who are the best citizens of a free nation, are those who willingly put themselves in uncomfortable discussions, surround themselves with ideas that agitate them. Therefore ideas that seem least appealing MAY be the most educational. If one attended this event, and found it lacking in stimulation, they ought to be flooded with thoughts of what was lacking -which also creates growth and WISDOM.
A few years ago I was slated to present an hour-long class on Diversity (one of my favorite topics, actually) to a group of 200 manufacturing workers in rural Tennessee. I had to cover topics like sexual harassment, gender and sexual orientation protections, and hostile work environments. This was a topic I had delivered many times, and so I had my own spin on the content so I could try and keep people awake and make things come alive a bit. At one point, we were discussing respect in the workplace. One of the attendees just wasn't understanding how someone could be offended by an off-color joke or snide sexual comment; I mean, it's all in good fun, right? Rather than shoot him down on the spot, I decided to talk about milk and honey. Why, you ask?
LoveTel Motel. A lyric inspired by TOL Wil Harrison's 40th birthday party celebrations. Simple really. I have always wanted to write a lyric along the lines of 'Blinded By The Light' that was full of great character names and so on. Wil provided a great blog post all about his party and the fun of the weekend's events that I simply put it all down into a lyric. I posted it on here and before I knew it I was being instructed to bring it along to band practise that same night and within a very short space of time the lads had concocted a rockin' vibe and we had this song down solid. Incredible really. I don't think that we have ever written a song that quickly.
The Communist or Leftist story is even simpler; and as well known. It is said that from the Night of the Long Knives onwards (some say even before), Hitler and the Nazis colluded with the capitalists and industrialists of Germany in order to destroy the ‘Red menace’ (no longer the Socialist Brown Shirts – these were real Commies). As a result of this, so the story goes, the Nazi Party effectively established was is often called, by the SWP for example, a system of ‘state capitalism’.
