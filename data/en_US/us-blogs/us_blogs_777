With the warm weather we had last week (I painted my toes & wore sandals for 2 days in a row!), my thoughts have been with spring and greenery. My hubby has started some of my herbs indoors and I bought a basil plant recently too. I am very much looking forward to a tasty palate of fresh greens and meals with light and crisp flavors.
Margaretha pulls the pistol from Gösta’s head and throws him to the floor. Then she deflates his nonsense: “You won’t escape by turning yourself into a beautiful corpse,” she tells him. “Don’t you know most people are dead already?” Now she plants one snowy boot by the fireplace and tells him her own, secret story of infidelity. Margaretha risked her reputation for a lover and still benefitted from her status as the wealthy Major’s wife. But it brought a curse upon her, levelled by her very own withered, bitter mother. As she tells Gösta, “At that moment I knew Margaretha Celsing was dead. For she would never have struck her mother. I’ve disowned my mother, yet I live on. Why should Margaretha Celsing be dead and Major’s wife live on?” Like Gösta, she now faces down the chattering classes and the status quo (really, just variations of the ever-ringing church bell) by being her own person. Not that it’s brought her happiness.

So, although we had a shaky start, and emotional ups and downs, it was a beautiful day. Everything that happened, happened because it felt right, rather than because we were sticking to pre-made plans. And because the spanking had come about naturally, it was much more special and connecting than it might have been otherwise, and was about ‘us’, rather than about expectations.
You'll note the book has the maximum 2 Kindle categories plus 4 Books categories. When you choose the categories, drill down as far as possible across the genres. Why? Because everywhere you see a blue link is a potential Bestseller or Popularity list where your book could show up. The more granular you go, the wider your exposure.

Then we thought, Let`s visit Filomena at the Portuguese Catholic Mission. She is the one who always supplied me with Portuguese school books for my Mozambique children, and we have really become good friends. When I surprised her, she and another friend said, You are coming just right! We are looking at the 600 photos we took on our last trip to Mozambique, of the school and the children whom we support and visited last month! So we stayed for 1 1/2 hours, had tea, chatting, and in the end got more books!

It was at this time that the girlfriend of the house opened her fridge too quickly and spilled my three remaining beers all over the floor. At least she knew she'd be cleaning it up. Well, perhaps that's the karma I get, considering that the only one of the three I really cared about and probably would have gotten around to drinking anyway was the one I semi-stole. Whatever, another time maybe.

Also, while I know that Sam won’t remember any of this, I still worry about the effects of his being on a "leash." I keep thinking about how they train circus elephants by keeping them on short leashes when they’re babies; that way, when they grow up to be gigantic, they remain tractable and submissive because they don’t realize that they are actually far more powerful than the rope that tethers them. In other words, I don’t Sam to sense on any level that he is tethered. Hopefully, within the next few weeks we’ll be able to get rid of the oxygen leash, and by the time Sam figures out how to get mobile, he’ll be able to crawl as far away from the oxygen tank as he pleases.
So Byron and I did not think it odd when Dorsey and Laurin suggested we sponsor a LA-31 dance off. Keeping alive old Cajun and Creole traditions while enjoying crafted beers is like a Blues Brothers, “we’re on a mission from God” calling for us. Plus no one could accuse us of putting on a dance competition because we wanted to win any of the prizes for ourselves - it is beyond belief that our dancing abilities would allow that.
There they did a complete colic treatment and also ultrasounded his abdomen but with only some minor finds, nothing to explain the heavy pain. By then Fonti was also looking slightly better, his vitals had stabilized and he was no longer displaying signs of colic.

Now we shop for our husbands, her son, and each other on our dynamic meanderings in the land of thrift-store serendipity. It's a game for us to find just the right item, to seduce each other into buying, say, the perfect pair of shoes. After all, what are friends for? To teach you how to love yourself better through their generous understanding. And to help you enjoy sexy footwear, of course.

Tomas is doing well. After several start-ups with feeds that increased too fast we are going the really slow approach. So far it is working, but it means an extra few days in here. The doctors (and there are lots) have all rounded. Tomas' stomach biopsy came back with chronic gastritis, and the liver biopsy came back with inflammation around the bile ducts. As usual it doesn't point them to any on diagnosis or direction, but this time around he is being followed by an incredibly caring GI doc. He said Tomas will go home with an appt. from metabolics (by-passing a possible 4 month wait), and he is going to call and/or email all his other doctors to get everyone on the same page, and that the time has come to stop the specialist approach and start managing him as a team. He will also be going home on a new medicine to try to keep his motility going and prevent any further psuedo obstructions. It has a very hit and miss reputation, so let's hope for a hit!

There have already been two preliminary judgments in this case, most recently at the start of February 2012 when Paddy won an important judgment which allows him to challenge the way in which NAMA sold the loans last September 2011. NAMA seems peripheral to Paddy’s fight at present in which he is trying to keep control of the Maybourne group, whose main assets are three 5-starLondon hotels – Claridges, the Connaught and theBerkeley. The Barclay twins who control Britain’s Daily Telegraph and the Ritz hotel on Piccadilly are trying to wrest control of the Maybourne group and they have so far apparently acquired Kyran McLoughlin’s and the Green family’s shareholdings.
I was on my normal high-speed Lonely Planet mission to cover as much territory as I could in a day when Darcy, the owner of the little B&B in the lighthouse quarters at Cape d'Or (who had no idea I was working for Lonely Planet) talked me into taking it slow for a change. He had a few extra rooms and his server was off that night so he gave me a deal in exchange for helping out in the kitchen - since his place is in one of the most beautiful spots in Nova Scotia, this was an offer I couldn't turn down.

And if you're going to ask how on earth you're supposed to know, without photos of the author, if the character is partly based on them? You've just proved my point. YOU CAN'T. Therefore, you shouldn't be using the term Mary-Sue, because you are making a claim about the character/author relationship which you cannot substantiate. Simple as that.

We kept it simple. Plain colors. Just mixed green to all the primary ones and added two fat quarter sized pices of different fabric to each color. Bella snagged my camera to snap pictures even she would have loved to help mixing in the fabric. The first time, however, we kept the mess and splatters on us including our hands even we wore gloves. A mess we made anyway after two ziplock bags malfunctioned on the bottom, but it still worked out.

There are a few things I'm grateful for today but something I really wanted to share was how thankful I am for the followers on my blog and the blogging friends I've made. I've met some of the most caring and loving friends through my blog and I feel really blessed to know you guys! I love that I get emails from so many of you and I love that our relationships don't just stop at comments. I know I don't always do the best job responding, or commenting back so I appreciate you guys sticking with me and constantly checking in! It means the world to me!
Seeking to avoid the bright streetlights, I ran across two or three front yards. Someone’s dog began to bark to let the town know something was up. I hid behind a tree so I could have a minute to think.
So what do I make of the Lerner book? First and foremost, I could not shake the impression that each of these two parts should have been the subject of a separate book. Short of that, I would have preferred if Lerner had expanded the second part of the book and provide further discussion of developments on the ground. I relished his discussions in this regard and I had only one complaint when I came to the end of chapter 8--it is such a pity that there is not more of it. Indeed, I cannot say that the first part aided much in my understanding of Lerner's elegant and edifying exposition of the granularity of the intersection between government involvement and entrepreneurship.
9. Make it a priority to (re)connect with those who love you. There is nothing so transformative as being in relationship with people who will truly care for you and whom you can care for. Mostly we judge the relationships that we are willing to spend time investing in by how good they feel at the time. This is a poor way to judge growth. Allow some degree of history to direct your course. For many of us, our family have been there once—invite them to be again. Dear friends we’ve held and perhaps lost along the way also can be re-engaged. It is a choice, permission given, to permit others to attend to our lives. There are perils—yet the promise is great also. Commit to those who will speak truly and lovingly, give yourself unreservedly to those relationships and see how they transform you.
We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we’re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.

Every relationship has arguments, hell even screaming matches, and it is inevitable. I really believe that it isn't a problem that a couple fights because sometimes that's how things need to be worked out and a compromise or decision will have to be made. BUT what the true test of it all is how to handle the fact that you just fought w/ your significant other.

Frederick Forsyth's first novel, The Day of the Jackal, was an international best-seller. I must have read this in the early 1970s, almost certainly a paperback edition borrowed from my Dad. I'm guessing it was the same story for The Odessa File and The Devil's Alternative. I also remember seeing The Shepherd in Clarks (the main bookshop in Chelmsford) when it came out but after that my memories are a bit patchy. I was still heavily and almost exclusively into science fiction in the 1980s and have only started picking up his latest thrillers in the last year or so.
I was given the Sunshine Award and the Liebster award recently by Bundana and Heather also gave me The Liebster Award. I am certain however, that Heather is just trying to get a particular piece of fabric from me. I can be bribed people.

But the beauty of the spring in Argentina makes up for all that I am missing in the northern hemisphere.

As I waded deeper into my writing career, I realized that it is extremely important to name the other characters as giving a name creates a mental picture in our mind about the character. With the picture comes the character’s looks and style of dressing in mind. It also helps us in creating more rounded characters. Nameless characters are akin to cardboard cut-outs which lack personality and appeal.

I noticed on several occasions staff would stop to talk to her. Absolutely nothing wrong with that, however, when she started to stutter and she couldn’t get the words out, they would slowly start walking down the hallway away from her as she was speaking. As they were moving down the hallway I would hear things from the staff like “Yeah, yeah….”, “Really?”, “See you later I have to go” and to be honest even “Hurry up and get it out. I don’t have time”. End result was she was left standing in the middle of the floor still trying to get her words out. I can only imagine how she must have felt when this happened.

Jesus’ words to Peter have two levels of meaning. At the material level they have to do with the washing of the feet as a social propriety. At the spiritual level they have to do with what really connects one with Jesus – called “the washing of regeneration.” It stands for an inner cleansing, the washing away of our sins, the cleansing of the soul by the blood of Christ.

I look back on that time and smile. I was so broken, and it was beautiful. God had me exactly where he wanted me, and he was teaching me the lessons I needed to learn then.

It has been a privilege and she has worked hard to bring stability to the community. She loves the town and knows the businesses and people. She says the charges are “baseless, intent on intimidation and misinformation.” She has made hard decisions and the town has become great over the past ten years. She would like to continue her work.

For all those hours invested in these game, for all the enjoyment I derived from the playing of them, the ending of Mass Effect 3 was an utter disappointment. There is no other way to put it. It was poorly explained, did not sensibly follow from what had come before it, and in all respects was a textbook example of poor writing. In short, the ending of the game was simply not up to par with the overall quality of the series, and when viewed as the crowning moment of the experience that is Mass Effect left me bitterly disappointed. While I do think the vehemence of some of the backlash has been unwarranted, simply dismissing it as fanboy entitlement, or claiming that people shouldn’t be upset because it is just a game are, as far as excuses go, complete and utter bullshit. I’ve talked before about the ways in which our capacity for empathy can be engaged by things which are not at all real in the classic sense of real (as well as here, though the focus in this case is dreams, rather than fiction). In a very real sense, and in a way that has absolutely nothing to do with being unable to distinguish reality from fantasy, these games, and the characters contained within, become real for us. While they might not exist, they affect and influence us in ways which have meaning.

The night before the battle, the knights and their squires pitched camp and readied themselves for the fight. The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of whom were busily polishing armor, brushing horses and cooking food. The second kingdom had 20 knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom there was only one knight, with his squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it from a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor.

I have no true desire to write, or do anything aside from sleep. I have a rather low tolerance for most everything- physical activities, emotional exertion, trying conversations.

With Anthropologie. When I'm feeling blue and haven't created anything...I often head off for a trip to Anthropologie. There are two in town, with a totally different vibe in each one.

Even though they have the same merchandise, just different design teams.
Ivy/Raj- Ivy and Diego are sitting around talking about colleges and environmental groups when she finds divorce papers from Raj. Diego tells Ivy he found a Artist-In-Residence program downtown and says that Ivy should join it with him. Naomi tells Ivy that she should sign her divorce papers and move on with her life. PJ also asks Ivy to pick a charity for him to fund and she picks Surf for Good, which is sponsoring a beach cleanup. At the beach, Ivy talks with Annie about her reluctance to sign her divorce papers and how she’s having trouble picking between the art residence thing with Diego and the Surf for Good sailing trip. Ivy later tells Diego she filled out the Artist-In-Residence program for Diego and wants to travel the world. Diego tells her he doesn’t want to breakup, but he also doesn’t want her to give up on her dream for him. After the beach cleanup, Dixon tells Ivy that Raj is dying. Ivy goes to see Raj and asks him how he could lie to her about his health. Raj tells her he didn’t want her to see him like this. Ivy then spills her guts, telling Raj he broke her heart. Ivy then asks him how he could be so selfish and cries, telling him that she’s right where she wants to be. Later, Raj wants to catch up with what’s been going on with Ivy, but she doesn’t want to talk about it. Raj tells Ivy that some people from Hospice came by and says he doesn’t want to be apart from her when he dies. Ivy then leaves to go get Raj some water. When Ivy comes back, she finds that Raj has died.

You get up this morning, you don’t feel well. Money is tight, you haven’t slept well for several nights, your boss has been very demanding lately and your dog is sick. So, you snap at your husband. Your husband is now grouchy and he goes to work and snaps at his secretary. She goes to lunch and is in such a bad mood she doesn’t leave the waitress a tip. The waitress is depending on her tips just to make her car payment. The waitress is unable to make her car payment, her car is repossessed, so now she has no transportation for work. Since his main waitress can’t get to work, the restaurant owner loses business and ends up shutting down the diner.

One question remains to be answered: Why do emotionally intelligent, nice people often become the victims of the psychopaths, who have abusive tempers and exhibit glibness, irresponsibility, and deception with an excessive need for control and interference corresponding to their sense of incompetency? In my observations, this is because managerial psychopaths use emotions, including your emotions, to advance their interests.

I had a great class at NEFS this past weekend. I had only three students so I was able to relax a bit and really give extra time to each individual. I felt bad for the store since it was probably losing money with the class; which would normally be cancelled with less than four participants, but it was a boon to the participants with lots of room to work and extra attention. It was interesting that though there was a poor turnout for the class I received 3 inquiries that week from folks wanting to take my class. I am working up a cost for students to come here for private lessons to accommodate those who cannot get to the other classes. I think this will be really beneficial to the students as they will have my wools and embellishments to work with plus all that one-on-one time. I may even offer an overnight guest room....we will see.
But it’s not a one-way flow of responsibility. By extension, it would seem that when “regular” people support the members of the above listed rogue’s gallery, when people vote for them, when people send them money, when people repeat their arguments, those same people can’t avoid some of the stain of the hateful rhetoric and actions. We get the leaders and politicians in their positions of influence spouting this crap because they think it will be effective in getting them elected. The members of the public who support them are in no small way responsible for the fact that these hateful ideas are considered to be part of our mainstream political and social conversation, that they are somehow equally valid viewpoints instead of the staying on the lunatic fringe where they belong.

Otherwise, Hamilton is a city ripe for the riding. With very few hills, besides the Escarpment, it should be a biking no-brainer, but Moyle feels the one-way streets are among the biggest barriers for a lot of cyclists. Even confident riders like himself can find it daunting to make a left turn off Main Street, where multiple lanes of traffic make it impossible to signal your way across the road.
I'm on Spring Break this week, and today was all about Mr. Liam! We woke up early (even though I offered to let him sleep in), had a leisurely breakfast (or two...the boy has hobbit tendencies), and made our way to the library for Book Babies. Since Mike and I work, we aren't able to take him, but since his sitter does story-time, we know it's something he loves!
Of all of the movie titles, the Kill Bill movies and Wizard of Oz were the only ones I had in my collection. But I did have the 3-D glasses and popcorn tub on hand!
I did well all day. I sucked on my inhalator furiously as I drank more and more cider in the hot summer sun. The people around were the usual mix of Beatherders: more friendly than odd, and some were very odd and very, very friendly. When the inhalator gave me hiccoughs, which it does now and again, I sucked on a dummy I’d brought, which has really helped.

Alek is wonderfully noble, young, and classist. When he spends time in a poor village, he doubts his father’s idea to give every man the opportunity to vote is at all sound. I was quite delighted by this turn, I have to say. It’s very true to the time period, and I would have been confused if he wasn’t. He’s very determined to be a great leader and do the right thing, although he has his moments of doubt. Deryn, however, outstrips him by far. She’s very clever, with a natural (but believable) talent with the fabricated animals. She is a soldier through and through, a fact Alek notes with great awe. She’s Scottish, she swaggers, and she’s worn out by all the work being a boy is, although she takes to it with great relish. When she finds herself developing a crush on Alek, she’s not so much delighted as exasperated by it, which made me laugh. Alek’s near hero-worship of “Dylan” (Deryn’s male alias) is very sweet, as he sees “him” as a sort of dashing Scottish air pirate. In short, Deryn is a brilliant character.
In addition, only around two and a half months before 9/11, on June 29, 2001, Abu Hamza hatched a plot ‘which involved attacks carried out by planes’ to kill President Bush at the G8 summit in Genoa. This plot was hatched actually within the Finsbury Park mosque in London.

We laughed a lot when we were together. One Sunday morning we tried to thumb a ride from a wooded area in Archer into Gainesville and no one would pick us up. In the sweltering heat we trudged along in the grass by the road and hoped for a kind driver to pick us up. Zack suggested that we try using our big toes instead of our thumbs. We tried that for awhile, and we laughed out loud as drivers slowed down for a closer look through the darkened windows of their air-conditioned cars.
She has no idea who her husband will be. But, like the practical character in a Jane Austen novel, she’s no romantic.
My friend Colleen, (A Dollmaking Journey) asked me about the size of this doll. She is about 7" from the tip of her toes to the top of her head. I love tiny dolls, but staying small and getting detail with paper clay can be a bit of a challenge. I use a mix of La Doll (very firm) and Premier (much softer) for the basic sculpt. I then remove excess by sanding, and/or a scalpel. Then I build areas using straight La Doll because it's very stiff and holds its shape. For example, for the lips, I add back a very tiny snake shaped piece of Premier and work it into place with a small,damp, filbert paintbrush.
Things on my mind lately:
So he wrote to Timothy, “The time of my departure is at hand.” That word “departure” is an unloosing, a dissolving into various parts, or a release. In other words, the time was soon to come when his soul would leave his body. This is seen in 2 Corinthians 5:8. “We are confident, I say, and willing rather, to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.”
Before Damon Albarn grew Gorillaz into a living, breathing, traveling musical circus he fronted a semi-popular, London based, Indie four-piece called Blur. The band is most popular for its ferocious, two-minute, 1997 stadium anthem “Song 2,” a track track that you may not know, but have definitely heard before. You will not be listening to that song here. Instead, I give you the band’s 1994 title-track “Parklife.” I was recently reintroduced to this number by a friend and have been listening to it non-stop. It features spoken word verses from British actor Phil Daniels, a chorus from Albarn, and a simplistic guitar riff that marches the song towards its conclusion. It’s the epitome of perfect pub music.

Jimmy Wilde was possibly the greatest 'small fighter' of all time. He fought at Flyweight bout had amazing knockout power. Out of his 138 career wins, 100 came from knockout. With 138 career wins, he only lost 5 fights; 3 loses were by knockout and 2 were by decision. But remember he was playing in a day and age where boxing matches went on until someone was knocked out, and if a fighter wasn't knocked out the fight was ruled a No Decision. But there were newspaper reporters who would form a decision from ringside and declare one of the fighters as the winner, but it would not be recognized as an official win. So his 3 loses by knockout are somewhat misleading. It is reported that he was knocked out in his final professional fight, losing his title, and announced his retirement shortly after.
Sometimes mistakes are mistakes.
Stay tuned for the interactivity discussion.
The revolution has its doves and hawks. The hawks are people that think there is no other way than to ask for international intervention. They are very scared that the revolution will be defeated before this actually materializes. They don’t know how it’s going to happen but they want to push for something – Turkish, NATO, something to bring the regime down. They think the regime is like the Libyan or the Iraqi regimes in that it will never have a breakdown on its own. They think the regime will keep killing people until there are no more people willing to demonstrate. The longer the revolution lasts, the more hawkish people are becoming. There are people that are for international intervention and for the militarization of the revolution like the Libyan model, by letting go of the peaceful means of demonstration and actually carrying arms. This is becoming more and more of a reality because of the defections from the army. The defectors are keeping their weapons with them even though they have no ability to actually fight, and so I think that any talk about a civil war in the country is completely immature. At the same time they are attacking every week or two a convoy or a building that belongs to the security apparatus in the country.

She stands up for her daughter but never considers her daughter less than.

Because of who she is.

Lastly this, which I find extremely practical even though it comes from an abstract philosophical discussion of theodicy: “Evil is not there to be understood, but to be fought.” We have theologian Henri Blocher to thank for this bit of brilliance, which he arrives at after 100 pages of analyzing various theological responses to the problem of evil throughout Christian history. No matter what you do, he concludes, you cannot dilute the evilness of evil, the goodness of God or the sovereignty of God. And what that leaves you with is an unexplainable mystery—where did evil come from and how does it coincide with the nature of God? But mystery does not equate with absurdity and the lack of explanation for evil is nothing if not fitting. How could the one bit of reality that is out of step with the God of reality who created all logic and wisdom be explained? “We do not understand the why of evil. But we can understand that we cannot understand. Human reason is made to trace the connections in God’s created order, and to weave harmonious patterns from them; to understand means to integrate. A rational solution to the problem of evil would necessarily imply that evil was an integral part of the harmony that came forth from God!… But evil is disruption, discontinuity, disorder, alienness, that which defies description in creational terms…” When you reach the end of understanding evil and face a choice between the reality of God and the reality of evil, choose to side with the God who makes the complaint of evil possible. It is the experience of His goodness and a suspicion of His power that makes the cry of protest rise in our hearts. An accurate theodicy will not exhaust its believers in a futile chase after evil’s source, but in a battle against its insidiousness. When we face failure and heartbreak, don’t wallow in the aches of “why?” forever, but join the God who hates it more than you and gave his own life to ruin it.

18. Good Enough
The Christian walk, for many of us, becomes repetitious, mundane, consistent and more focused on pleasing God rather than trusting God; more focused on pleasing man rather than serving man. The latter two Jesus spoke of and said, “These two, hang all the words of God.” (Matt 22:37-40) The Christian life, for most, will become filled with meaningless repetitions and traditions that boast a resemblance to the Pharisees in many ways, and many of us will be left empty and hurting.
People come in all shapes and sizes, a variety of colors, personalities ranging from the complete bore to the life of the party - but when you send someone a picture that looks NOTHING like you and expect them to not notice, then you should make your reservation for hell right now. Sure, we all like how we look in "good" photos. I can capture an angle of myself that no one else can see. Suddenly, instead of a round face I have chiseled cheekbones! Am I proud of these pictures? Hell yes! Do I send them to people and claim I look exactly like that? No way. It's not fair, or right. Guys should take note of this too...do not send me a picture of yourself 10 years ago and 70 pounds lighter. If you do, be prepared to suffer the consequences, because I will call you on.

me: I find you to be very amusing! Originally if you are speaking on biblical terms yes more than one wife was allowed BUT you can also see if you have read the story of Jacob and his wives rebeka and leah how much jealousy and hurt was involved in having these two women who were sisters as his wives. He loved one more than the other and it showed. You want to sleep around that is your business but as for me I don’t want a shared partner. There is a lot to be said for monogamy. Sex today is more dangerous than ever and I’d like to stay alive long enough to enjoy my old age. Good luck Oh and would you feel the same way if it were your wife who wanted to seek another man for herself?
As one quick example, let’s look at the maternal wall: studies have shown that women are penalized and considered less promotable because of family committments. As University of Illinois management professor Jenny Hoobler found, this holds true even when women have no kids — and don’t plan on having any. We interviewed Hoobler for our book, and here’s what she told us:

This was my mistake. I should’ve known better. But I stopped taking my meds, convinced I was cured and that no further help was required. I even started some hare-brained experiment on myself. Screwing around with my meds to see what might happen if i took them, say, every other day instead of daily. I convinced myself that it was because i was stable now and that it was harmless because I was only experimenting on myself. Not exactly a good habit for a psychology student who, quite frankly, should’ve known better.
Yesterday was possibly the most unpleasant time I have ever had running. Several of us headed up to Wallace State Park for the Cameron Fatt Ass on New Years Day. The race temps were about 13 degrees and there was a nice 20 mph breeze to keep us cool as we plowed through the 6 or so inches of snow for 31 miles. It is a 5 loop course so we had to run by the warm cabin and our cars 4 times which was punishment enough.

While the plot of this is not the most unique thing out there, I still found myself fully immersed in it, as I’m a huge sucker for road-trip books. Moreover, the variety of setting and people didn’t hurt the case one bit. Higgin’s writing was also decent, because not only did she bring the characters to life but the plot lines as well, and she did a fabulous job of revealing those types of secrets that readers love to have!
The inevitable happened though. The chronic anxiety I felt having to meet, and work with, new people meant that it wasn’t long before the pattern started again.

Why has Beijing been destroyed?

Some important advocates raised loud voices here; big-name Western foundations offered expertise, to no avail. Or too little, too late. China, built of wood, rotted away.

Brock Lesnar would be next to appear backstage for this next segment. Lesnar was casually strolling his way to his locker room before being stopped for an interview. Lesnar didn’t seem to keen on giving an interview for Josh Matthews. Lesnar manhandled Matthews and propped him up against a production truck before letting him go. Matthews then made a remark, but that ignited Lesnar. Lesnar threw Matthews across the room without even saying a word. If there’s a lesson to be learned from this segment, don’t mess with Brock Lesnar.

I'd love to say that I feel embraced by my sport, that going to these events is a huge group hug. I will say that watching these amazing athletes is something best appreciated by someone who has lived that life. Once, or twice. But the fact of the matter is that I think the push towards winning dulls some of the simpler opportunities of growing character and helping people along the way. It's not the sport that's the bond - it's the people. And today those people have names. Laura, and David.

"A deadly serial killer is on the loose, modelling his sickening murders on Shakespeare's plays. But why is he killing? And how can he be stopped?" In contrast to that last wonderful book, this one was appalling. It's a 'Da Vinci Code' ripoff, substituting Shakespeare for Leonardo, and consisting of a Shakespeare expert chasing around the world following 'clues' to try and find a lost Shakespeare play, shadowed by a murderer who threatens her and kills off various people who help her. I wasn't in the least bit interested in any of the characters, couldn't follow the tortuous relationships either in the present day or in the flashbacks to the 17th century, and didn't care about any of it. Rather than pass this book on as soon as humanly possible, I'm tempted to throw it in the bin, and I NEVER do that.

AB: It seemed to disturb me for years that although expansion in 1967 was one of the largest events in NHL history, there had yet to be a book written on it. Even before researching the topic, I knew how great of an effect it had on professional hockey, especially on the NHL as a whole. Hockey was really just a regional sport before they expanded the game in 1967, but once they did so, it turned into a national spectacle—even if it’s not quite at the level that baseball and football are at just yet.

Okay, bad boys do have to have a heart though, redeeming qualities, kindness shadowed underneath the bad boy image. What makes them sexier is the unpredictability, the fact that they look after their women, and have a delicious jealous streak ;) aka the 'no one touches my woman'.

Renew Lehigh Valley has encouraged a regional and cooperative approach to the water infrastructure challenges facing the Lehigh Valley. The WIFIA legislation would provide a means for cost efficient solutions to be developed for the communities within the Lehigh Valley, while also fostering a mindset of sustainable growth and development. Water is vital to our existence. It’s time to bring the discussion about our water infrastructure challenges above-ground and address them as an entire Lehigh Valley.
She came here with expectations, promised a life improved. A man I assume, dazzling her with the prospect of a house, a family, a life. She must have been a daft creature to settle for that, to agree to come here to these impossible outlands in search of nothing more. And then something went wrong. An argument. A quarrel. A brutal and shocking ending. Some digging and here she lies.
I took my exam in Austin at a brewpub, proctored by another Texas Certified Cicerone™, with a coworker of mine. We had been sharing information and encouraging one another in anticipation of the exam. That afternoon we carpooled and shared last minute thoughts. We found ourselves the only two people taking the exam, but somehow I was at ease, confident. This was the biggest, longest, most involved test I have ever taken. When I took the ACT the one semester I went to college, I had multiple choice. This was all short answer and essays. There were certainly some questions I did not know the answers to, but I flew through the written portion thirsty for the opportunity to identify diacetyl and oxidation during the tasting portion. When I finished, I turned it in, said a silent prayer to Ninkasi, and hoped like hell that I didn't have my head up my ass.

We're trying and comparing different bottles, and branching out into other alcohols through experimenting with some classic cocktails. Gin has led us to Campari and Sweet Vermouth through the Negroni, while bourbon has led us to bitters via the Old Fashioned.

I spent some time on a few AV forums. Fair warning, it’s important to severely limit your time there – that’s a level of geekdom that results in a strong desire to play D&D. What I did figure out is that HBO started implementing HDCP several years ago. WARNING, technical content to follow! Any fairly recent (~5 years) HDMI implementation includes HDCP which is a content protection protocol. The host device queries connections and, upon discovering an HDCP compliant port, establishes a sink and provides a key for decryption. This enables content providers to encrypt video with the master key and for your device to decrypt it. Turns out some clever folks have been able to pirate (gasp!) content via non-HDCP HDMI cables. HBO (and most content providers) either have already, or will begin going this route shortly.

I encourage everyone to express themselves so that we don’t get lost like multitudes of others. However, let’s keep in mind that the collecting and cataloging of “nondualiana” is only a human interest and no different than collecting and cataloging stamps. Let’s not imagine we’re doing anything other than working at what is natural for us. We could just as easily be fixing cars, farming, or handing out donuts at Krispy Kreme. This “nonduality stuff” is only work.

Finally, our goodies arrived. I have no complaints about the plate of zingy, chewy macaroons that Wendy and I shared, nor about the exquisite rose-scented China tea that accompanied them.

Jason Maguire, who was born on April 13, 1980, is the nephew of former top-jockey-turned-trainer Adrian Maguire. He started out in Irish pony races and partnered his first British winner, the Tony Martin-trained Search For Peace, at Cheltenham on November 12, 1999. He began riding for Gloucestershire trainer Tom George shortly after coming to Britain and enjoyed a seven-year partnership that yielded a Cheltenham Festival victory in 2002 when Galileo took the Royal & SunAlliance Novices’ Hurdle. Maguire’s working relationship with George, which was never contractually formalised, ended in January, 2007, and he is now attached to Donald McCain’s Cheshire stable. Maguire’s association with the McCains arose due to Ginger’s close friend Sean Byrne, a trainer from Dunboyne, County Meath, who found the future Grand National winner Amberleigh House for the family and John Halewood, although the jockey’s first ride for Ginger in November, 2003, proved less than successful as Lambrini Gold was pulled up in a Ludlow novices’ hurdle. In 2008 he took the valuable Lanzarote Hurdle at Kempton in 2003 on Non So and captured the 2007 John Smith’s Midlands Grand National on Baron Windrush. He had a second Cheltenham Festival success in 2008 on Whiteoak in the David Nicholson Mares’ Hurdle and added in 2010 with Peddlers Cross in the Neptune Investment Management Novices’ Hurdle. He partnered the same horse to victory in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle and second place in the 2011 Champion Hurdle. Maguire also rode Barizan to win the Grade One Four-Year-Old Hurdle at Punchestown in April, 2010. His biggest success came when he landed the John Smith’s Grand National on Ballabriggs in 2011. He got married in September with his school friend, Grand National winning trainer Gordon Elliott, as best man. This season Maguire has ridden 132 winners (March 27) with a strike rate of 24 per cent and has added two further Cheltenham Festival successes to his name thanks to Cinders And Ashes and Son Of Flicka, who won the William Hill Supreme Novices’ Hurdle and Coral Cup respectively. He also guided Overturn to victory in the Grade One Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle in November, before partnering the game front-runner to finish second in the Stan James Champion Hurdle. John Smith’s Grand National Record: 2001 No Retreat (PU bef 17th); 2002 Birkdale (10th); 2003 Tremallt (9th); 2005 Europa (20th); 2006 Lord Of Illusion (PU bef 17th); 2007 Idle Talk (UR 19th); 2008 Cloudy Lane (6th); 2009 Cloudy Lane (UR 15th); 2010 Cloudy Lane (8th), 2011 BALLABRIGGS (WON)

I'm telling you, when we walked through those shabby chic, rusty doors I was in heaven. My daughter and I spent 4 hours there and that was going at a pretty good pace so we would get it all in. It was a little overwhelming somewhat but in a good way lol. I did go away with some goodies but not enough! Also, the vibe was super great, just to be around people who love all that rusty, chipped, worn stuff was truly fun.

This attack is actually a variation of the French-German attack on England. As I mentioned earlier, Germany gets the short end of the English spoils if England heads east towards Scandinavia and not south against France. France can then sneak in the backdoor via the Irish Sea and Liverpool, leaving Germany to batter through the North Sea defense line. Germany, when seeing that this is about to happen, must quickly scout out a new target. Continued aid of the French attack on England will gain Germany little or nothing and later place Germany at the mercy of the larger France. A prime example of this can be found in 1971BC.

My little boy is a thumb sucker. He always has been. In fact, we have a video of him from in my womb sucking his thumb. He was sucking his thumb on the day he was born. When he was really little, he used to put one hand on his neck and suck his thumb with the other. For the last few years he has been putting one thumb in his belly button while sucking his thumb.

A couple of unknown college students (?) trying to conduct this interview have not got any basic facts in command, but no worries. He waves a book around, a book written by an expert: John Douglas, Brilliant FBI Profiler and Catcher of Many Bad Guys....He barely lets Lewis get a word in edgewise as he gushes about Douglas and FBI profiling. In the book, Douglas was trying to figure out the motive of who would do this and the guy who did this..."was a loser, was angry at the world and was lashing out." And that something must have happened in September right before the murders, and that something triggered the murderer's anger. He didn't do such a sophisticated job at putting the cyanide into the pills, so he wasn't very sophisticated. Nor was he very organized, and he surely drove a five year old car that needed some work.

As Laura Dick Coelho, one of the late author's daughters, told me: "Everything in the Philip K. Dick world is complicated." She was talking specifically about the personal life of her father — she's the offspring of the third of his five marriages. But her observation applies well to the dispute over the 2011 Matt Damon film "The Adjustment Bureau which was based on "Adjustment Team," a short story Dick wrote in the 1950s.
If I had a million dollars beyond anything I or my family could ever need, what frivolous thing would I buy? I’m torn between chartering a jet for all my family and friends to take us to Los Angeles to eat at In-N-Out burger (with a special stop somewhere along the way to get something vegetarian for my sister-in-law) and paying Jessica Simpson to change her daughter’s name to something less masculine. That’s weird for me because I like boy names for girls, but c’mon. Maxwell Dean. Really? Maybe she could throw in a two-for-one so her sister would change her kid’s name from Bronx Mowgli.
The impulse to travel is a deeply ingrained one. Whether we get it from the old hunter-gatherer instinct to follow the migrations of our food sources, or if it's more similar to modern-day escapism, the need to explore has become as quintessential to humanity as empathy is. And well it should be- there's nothing that broadens the horizons more than putting yourself somewhere you've never been, surrounded by a language you don't speak and smells and sounds you've never encountered before. It's marvelous, exhilarating, and terrifying, and if I ruled the world, I would put it at the top of everyone's to-do list.
This one was different.
As of Thursday April 29th, Lil Monty is full term! 37 weeks marks the "official" full term marker but it is ideal to go to 40 weeks still.

The storyline is remarkably intriguing and is exceptionally simple. Through the lead – Holden’s aimless two-day wonder, with his unique perspective, attitude and his speech patterns, presents thoughts and psychological feelings of an adolescent realistically. When it was published in the States in 1951, it set off a ‘Catcher’s Cult’ , the reaction from public was polarized – it was listed as a forbidden book, has been selected as teaching materials and also, a novel which millions or more people have read. Holden disliked and tried to resist this hypocritical society, he was unprepared to the world of grown-ups and paid homage to the happiness in being a child.
Be prepared for an enormous amount of fun in this book. Bob Ley, Bill Simmons, Tony Kornheiser, Chris Berman, and on and on and on—these are just remarkably funny and interesting people. There are literally hundreds of “cocktail party stories” to re-tell in this book, complete with clever observations, raunchy humor, and the cynicism you would expect in any modern newsroom. I laughed out loud several times while reading this, and I was also pleased that it reminded me of so many legendary sports moments. Case in point, the retelling of Berman’s decision to go silent for 22 minutes after Cal Ripken, Jr. broke the streak. Brilliant. The book is attentive to the high points of the network: Jimmy Valvano’s speech at the ESPYs and the thoughtful reporting around the Atlanta Olympics bombing; and the low points: LeBron’s “Decision” and Rush Limbaugh’s stint on NFL Primetime.

Newspapers vilified Grant for allowing his army to be caught offguard on the morning of April 6. Journalists began spreading the false rumor that he had been drunk during the battle. Many credited Buell for taking command of the Union forces on April 7. Sherman was hailed as a hero. Grant’s career suffered a temporary setback when head of all Union forces in the Western theater, General Henry W. Halleck combined and reorganized his armies and demoted Grant to the powerless position of second-in-command. Halleck remained in charge, until he was promoted as general-in-chief of all Union forces and called back to Washington D.C. Beauregard was relieved of command of the Confederates’ Army of Mississippi around late May/early June 1862. Braxton Bragg assumed his old position.

The article notes that one reason for this limitation is the limited capacity of short-term memory. One way of looking at short-term memory is the number of items that we can attend to at one time. Here is where the Magic Number 7 Plus or Minus Two, created comes in. Actually subsequent research has indicated that the true magic number might be 5 or even lower. An important factor is the nature of the items to be remembered. It is prudent that you do not consider more options at a time than is warranted by your magic number. So if more items need to be evaluated, it is good to evaluate them in groups, with run-offs, if necessary.
Either way, this represents a remarkable feat of engineering. At least Bin Laden got the human touch. This latest requires the identification, targeting and assassination of a carload of human beings from a position hundreds and perhaps thousands of miles beyond the boundaries of the state in which the car motors along.

Jon took Evan on the bumper cars, and at first, I was intent on getting a clear shot of them.

This beer is what it is, a Mexican Lager. It is in the same boat with Corona, Tecate, Sol. Except in my opinion has a much better flavor and taste. Goes down very easy and doesn't have that skunky after taste of a Corona. I think it outdoes even some of the American lagers like Coors and even Miller Lite (gasp!).

As I was getting a dragon tattoo, two men joined the queue to get theirs. We got to talking; and I found out that their names were Paul and Alan and that they were from the UK. They stuck around, and we got some drinks together. I pulled them aside and told them point-blank that I really wanted my mom to have the best time (she had recently gotten out of a depression) and if they could keep an eye on her throughout the evening, I’d really appreciate it.
The Idaho CSR stewardship crew was out enjoying the “office” last week, collecting microchip temperature data loggers from Silver Creek near Picabo, Idaho. These data loggers are used to record the water temperature fluctuations and to determine the effectiveness of water-cooling strategies. In the past, water from the artesian spring would flow into Silver Creek after traveling several hundred meters. In order to encourage natural cooling, a pond was constructed that would hold the warmer water and cool it down. Water from the artesian spring was recording temperatures around 90º before it entered the cooling pond. The data logger at the exit of the cooling pond was recording temperatures around 70º.

Krampus may seem a little dark for a holiday which stresses “peace on Earth,” but that’s not entirely his fault. Like Christmas trees and Easter eggs, Krampus is rooted in pre-Christian religious holidays, and was re-appropriated as an Alpine Christian figure. Additionally, since his traditions didn’t cross the Atlantic with most early settlers, Krampus hasn’t been a staple of American Christmases, and he hasn’t been subjected to the same kinds of santization and commercialization as Santa. While there has been a renewed interest in Krampus in recent years, he’s still not very well represented.
Hi Vanessa,
Barry Winfield, born on December 21, 1940, built Stoke-based pump engineering firm Barry Winfield & Sons from scratch and headed the firm for about 40 years. He lives in retirement near Uttoxeter, having left his son Andrew to run the family business. He had horses with the late David Nicholson and when “The Duke” retired, he kept his horses with Nicholson’s former assistant, Alan King. Winfield first met the young King at Nottingham racecourse and has established a warm friendship with the trainer over the years. Winfield’s colours of red, with red spots on white sleeves and brown cap are most famously associated with My Way De Solzen, whom he bought and owned in partnership with Jerry Wright, Andrew Longman and Clive Fenton. The gelding landed the 2006 Grade One Ladbrokes World Hurdle and the 2007 Grade One Arkle Challenge Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival, as well as Ascot’s Grade One Long Walk Hurdle in 2005. The useful handicap hurdler Mughas is another that sported Winfield’s colours. He initially owned West End Rocker in partnership with Andrew Longman but after Longman decided he wanted to sell the gelding at Brightwells Cheltenham Sale in April, 2009, Winfield reinvested along with long-time friend Tim Leadbeater, the new partnership paying £100,000 at the auction for West End Rocker. Tim Leadbeater, 67, is a director of JCB and has owned horses for many years, notably in the care of trainer Jim Wilson. Leadbeater and Wilson’s biggest successes came when Taberna Lord landed the Coral Golden Hurdle Final at the 1987 Cheltenham Festival and when Glenbrook D’Or won the 1994 Midlands National. His pink colours with purple checks and black cap have also been successful on the Flat, mainly with trainer Reg Hollinshead. John Smith’s Grand National Record: 2011 West End Rocker (BD 6th)
Though the label categorizes this beer as an ESB, it smells like a barleywine, with that strong aroma of alcohol, as well as lots of dark berry and raisin. It has that "leathery" quality that so many darker beers give out. In a blind sniff-test, I wouldn't have pegged this as an Extra Special Bitter.

I found a perfect example of this mockery illustrated prominently on the very top front-page of last Sunday’s Rapport newspaper (dated 2011-07-03). I don’t have the print version in front of me now, but I can recall that the words were, “Malema: Ek wil ‘n Boer word.” (Malema: I want to become a Boer – meaning “farmer”). The headlines were a reference to an article on pg 12 of the newspaper. The online version can be read here in Afrikaans, and concerns an interview Malema had with Ferial Haffajee, the editor of the City Press newspaper. It was during this interview that Malema confessed that he wanted to be a farmer, and not the president of the country (thank goodness for that!) - Julius Malema in sy eie woorde.

Candles --I don't know what kind of candle selection they usually have, but I couldn't find any. (Doug said the "Book Mart"--which just re-opened today--was selling them, but only allowed two per family.) The diaper selection was getting pretty picked over and I imagine the formula was all gone. Not many people were buying cold stuff (since it was sitting there warming up) but the bread shelves were bare.

"As culture changes, it affects our brains, and as our brains change, that affects our culture. You can't separate the two," Berns says. "We now have the means to start understanding this relationship, and that's putting the relatively new field of cultural neuroscience onto the global stage."

However, the trespass, the act of missing the mark, is not like the gift. Why? The trespass by Adam caused many to die in all three forms. However the grace of God and the “chárisma” by the grace of Jesus Christ have abounded for many. The Greek word translated as “abounded” means “to superabound.” This is telling us that God’s grace that by which we are saved through faith is in itself a miracle beyond our comprehension. This abounding is not describing numbers, but quality. The trespass brought judgment unto condemnation while the “chárisma” brought justification. All born of Adam are under the condemnation of this judgment, but those who receive the abundance of grace and the “chárisma” of righteousness, reign in life through our Lord Jesus Christ. The Greek word translated as “reign” describes the rule of a king. Whereas those who are under the condemnation of judgment are ruled by sin, the ones who have received grace have eternal life, which is spiritual life.

4. Letting Up Despite Great Faults - In Steps (3:44)
Since then, I have been aware of the differences between my reflections and myself, which have only seemed to increase. None of them can tell me why we meet, but we have made some progress. A reflection of mine once brought up doppelgangers as an explanation, fueling an obsession with folklore that lasted three years of my late adolescence & middle school years. The problem is that a doppelganger is an ill omen. It’s a haunting double that means you will die if you see it. It makes me wonder why, then, I’m still alive.
I am not as spiritual as my husband is. I respect the fact that he is very convicted. I also don’t want my family living on the streets, starving to death. It just keeps getting harder and harder. He and I get further and further apart. What I was once completely secure in, Now, I’m not so sure. He only ever sees what is not done or accomplished. Never what is done or accomplished. He then tries to say that he is not pessimistic. I think he may not understand the meaning of the word.

The reviews in general are conventional and miss a dark, sinister heart in this well-acted and engaging drama. (2) It is seen as entertainment in a standard theme of coming of age after some life experiences. It has a subtle screenplay by Nick Hornby and the director was involved until the third draft.(3) The moral of the story is about making the right choices in life. Jenny and her parents are taken in by a charmer, a sociopath, and the choice is fun and sophisticated restaurants and hotels or a humdrum life of teaching or civil service that begins after Oxford University.

When it comes to sex, that too has evolved. We have birth control and the sexual revolution came around a long time ago. We can have sex with whoever we want pretty much whenever we want. I admit sex is certainly better with someone you love, but it’s totally do able without love. Fun too.

I think growing up is so much easier said than done. I am approaching the second semester of my junior year in undergrad and I am beginning to feel some pressure regarding the real world. As college students we may become bombarded with the many questions we are asked by family and friends regarding our future. It is sometimes then that we realize it is time to grow up. Time to be responsible. Time to begin to prepare ourselves to live independently and pay bills. Even if some of us already have the responsibility of paying bills, there may be some intimidation about the fact that whether we are ready for not, the world is waiting for us bright eyed and bushy tailed.

I've said this before, and I plan to say it again as often as it is necessary and possible to do so, Our Constitution and Bill of Rights didn't enshrine free speech, freedom of the press, freedom of association, sanctity of contract, takings clause, gun rights, etc, because they were the most important and valuable of our individual rights, but because those were the most politically important rights, which if kept secure, would prevent a tyrant from successfully taking power and extinguishing all of our rights. With bailouts, business takeovers, proposed net neutrality acts, defacto 'fairness doctrine' measures, and targeting of an unapproved press, attacking freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of contract... that is arguably the road being paved for us to walk down... will we go down it?

The most heartrending part of the whole tragedy was the failure, right after the Titanic sank, of those boats which were only partially loaded, to pick up the poor souls in the water. There they were, only four or five hundred yards away, listening to the cries, and still they did not come back. If they had turned back, several hundred more would have been saved. No one can explain it. It was not satisfactorily explained in any investigation. It was just one of the many “Acts of God” running through the whole disaster.

this work by examining and refuting the doctrines of Malthus and the Neo-Malthusians concerning overpopulation. He argued that there was no evidence that the world was facing a crisis of overpopulation and then deconstructed the Malthusian narrative step by step. He argued that the real cause of poverty was economic injustice and not overpopulation. He then moved on to discuss the health risks of contraceptive methods, the degradation of women which was inseperable from their use, the damage that they caused to marriages and finally the way in which in birth control was used to control the poor. He ended the book by discussing the immorality of contraception in the light of the teaching of the Catholic Church.

Hume, writing with Berkeley well-digested, develops the essential argument without the outré metaphysical language. Hume collapses the subject-object distinction into the subject as Berkeley did before him. But Hume recognized that once the distinction was collapsed neither of the categories “materialism” or “idealism” made any sense. The distinction simply vanishes. If there are no “physical” properties when these are meant to be separate from “phenomenal” properties the argument works with equal force in the other direction as well. It is on this point that the early 20th century empiricists misinterpreted Hume so grievously, understanding him as a “phenomenalist,” one who holds that we can refer only to “phenomena” as distinct from the “actual” (else why use the word at all?). On empiricism properly understood there is no meaningful (semantic) distinction on which to hang the metaphysical language. This insight is also the crux of the next two versions of the argument, but both are worth considering in detail by virtue of differences in language and emphasis, and to cement the point.

Use the white pencil to draw an egg on a leaf, a caterpillar, a cocoon and a butterfly (we folded the paper in half and drew on the fold). (The kids were given 12 x 12 cm squares and asked the kids to draw as big as they could – otherwise they tended to draw something small in the center of the paper – making it hard to color, cut out and see). The drawing above is not to scale, but just to give you an idea of what the pieces you should have.

As Mayweather cleared his schedule with the win, it is now up to Manny to step it up and blast JuanMa. The win will also clear Manny for a possible match up against his welterweight rival. The dream fight that everyone’s been begging for. I was still a college student when I first heard of this intriguing fight. That was two years ago, 2009. The fight was all set for March of 2010 until Mayweather demanded a strict drug examination routine, and understandably Pacquiao’s camp disagreed. Since then the deal’s gone awry and the fans were left to just dream and drool for the fight. So I am now praying for the boxing gods for this fight to happen, I wish that Pacquiao takes all of the test and just suck it up. I wish that Mayweather just drop his silly demands and just suck it up too. I wish that all of the persons involve just forget about everything and just give the fans what they want and deserve.

Judge Waxse debunks the zealous advocacy point, condemns (not that he needs to) the “make more money” point, and goes on to a meticulous examination of those parts of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which prohibit excessive discovery, impose a duty of cooperation and give judges the duty (not merely the right) to punish offenders. The article ends with a list of principles – ordinary human principles – which are applicable to the relationship between the parties involved in any litigation matter.

As to how much time this whole process will take, unfortunately, no accurate answer exists. It could take six months or it could take a couple of years, or worse, longer. Any estimate given today could change by tomorrow because the factors driving the government processing times can change quickly. Such factors include government resources devoted to reviewing applications in any one category, background check hang ups, changes in policy, and changes in visa category quotas.

In my first post for 2012 I recall one of many great quotes to come from the last Money Mastery weekend, from Alice and Wonderland.
My trip out there earlier today revealed lots of bean germination – both runner and pea-beans (featured in the Guardian last weekend). None had made a bid for freedom today, but my ‘jumping bean’has not germinated, so I suspect a mouse was responsible for the earlier migration and that it might have consumed the embryo… resowing probably required. Nevertheless, the greenhouse has restorative properties for me… I think I need to put a chair out there… and possibly some gin and tonic.

The most frightening aspect of these events has to be the Fukushima I. On Saturday, one of the buildings in the nuclear power plant exploded in truly frightening fashion. To witness the videos played on loop on the news channels was nothing short of the most terrifying thing that I had ever seen.

So, as you see, we are only “mortal men” for a very short season in presence in this world. Moreover, from the testimony of scripture we are in the world but not of it — and as saints born from Heaven above we are not to think of ourselves as mere mortal men as if we were of this earth.

In other news...sorry for the radio silence lately, ya'll. I was on a bit of an emotional walkabout last week, plus I've been chipping away at the first draft of Thorns (and also working on the cover design, which is coming together NICELY). I've also been dealing with a muscle injury for the last few months, and April was kind of a "I'm in pain so I don't want to do anything, let alone write" kind of month. But thankfully physical therapy has been working and I seem to be getting better, finally.

I worked diligently on my post conference reflection and conference that afternoon while my students watched the cutest Reading Rainbow video on If You Give A Mouse a Cookie and cause and effect and went to specials. Who would have thought all these years later Reading Rainbow would still be a hit? Well it certainly was! No, I'm not a teacher that lets my kids watch movies all the time but it was Friday, St. Patrick's Day, I had my formal observation for 45 minutes, and we're all really ready for Spring Break so yes I took a "break" and worked on my teacher paperwork.

Try to go to the dealership with a friend or a family member who can stop you from making your purchase at any point. Someone you can trust and someone you can listen to. The reason I say this is because imagine you’re at the dealership and the car of your dreams is right in front of you. All you have to do is sign some papers, pay a down payment, and that car is yours. You might not care how much it costs each month, but you will once that first statement comes to your mail. And once you drive that car off the lot, it’s typically yours (although I think you can sell it back within 24 hours, but not 100% sure about this — not worth the risk).

Anyway, just before reaching the freeway, I stopped at one of the many vista points so graciously provided to us travelers. It was a breathtaking view of a valley with a backdrop of mountains and cloud cover. What I didn’t realize until after taking several shots was that the mountains had their own backdrop. There, backdropping the mountains, was the Pacific Ocean I don’t know how many miles away! It was incredible! Despite my efforts, though, the pictures didn’t show what I saw in sufficient detail. But maybe that’s simply the difference between live and Memorex, huh? I hope viewers will think otherwise and are as deeply moved as I was.

Never mind that the Malian military has no legal authority to arrest civilians. Amid all the confusion, one thing has become perfectly clear: reports of the junta’s demise were greatly exaggerated.

Beautifully filmed by Claire Denis' regular DP Agnès Godard, 'Sister' is tragic in its depiction of a situation in which a desperate child is ultimately forced to barter with his only relative for even the slightest expression of affection.

Don’t believe him, by the way—here’s a more accurate description of state spending.
I would understand if a sign was up, or if the particular place of business understood that you can plug in at most other places, but they are just being weird for whatever reason (and so the misunderstanding is more because of their quirk than your inconsideration).

When I was planning our trip home for last November, I wanted to go to Moloka`i on top of being on O`ahu and Hawai`i. When it came down to practicality, we didn’t have enough time and I was afraid of Grandma getting frustrated with trying to cook for me without gluten or dairy. The last thing I wanted to do was make her frustrated doing something she loved to do, cook for her loved ones.
I won’t do what they want, obviously. But it is more than a little troubling just how far these criminals will go and just how powerless people like the CIA’s OIG, the Justice Department, and the Administration are to pull these people into line. If that’s not it, then it must be ordered. Which is it? I still think the former, but there comes a point when you have to wonder why it continues unabated.
One might think there is no need for "reason" to bake a good cake. I tend to agree. But I usually come up with something to celebrate. After all, if there's going to be cake, there might as well be something to honor, toast or remember.

This blog goes all the way back to 1979, when my babies Heather and Kathy were only little. We had just moved back to Toronto from Powassan, a small town just south of North Bay.

Libby was adopted domestically at birth and has always wanted to pass on the gift of love and family that adoption brought her down to her children and family one day. Since we met we have talked openly about the idea of growing our family through adoption and began researching the avenues of adoption prior to Mason being born! Adoption and birth are truly the best gifts you can give a child and a family. So if you are able and called to this, why would you even hesitate for a second?
Towards the end of the 1970s gold prices rose steeply and it looked as if the South African economy would recover its former glitter. However, the gold-price bonanza did not last and instead of windfall profits being spent on labour intensive developments such as housing and community development for the less advantaged population, most of the bonanza was spent on apartheid structures such as bantustan governments, a beefed-up defence force, and high technology projects such as atomic energy research and armament industries. By the mid 1980s South Africa's economy was in serious trouble and its apartheid dream in tatters. Serious political unrest grew and South Africa was well on the way to revolution. This was only averted by the historical process of transfer of power to a democratically elected government in 1994.

Come my most amiable Jesus, come; for you come chiefly for sinners. Come then to me who am the most unworthy of them. But before you enter to make your offering, consecrate the temple of my heart so much defiled by sin, and profaned by the idol self-love. Break and destroy that enemy of yours; and since all things are possible to you, change the love I bear myself into your love, and so make a great saint of a great sinner.

In design spaces for his clients, he attended to every aspect of the project ensuring that everything turned out perfectly.

Actually, it's THIS reading thing: The Semi-Charmed Summer 2012 Book Challenge. To be honest, I don't participate in book challenges very often. I'm mostly a "read whatever I feel like in that moment" kind of girl. But, there was something about this challenge that intrigued me. Maybe it was the points. Like my friend reiterated, "BUT THERE ARE ARBITRARY POINTS INVOLVED!!!" Tell me that doesn't appeal. Maybe it was the varied categories and the fun of picking all the books that would fit into it. Let me tell you, if you are older than 30, that whole "book/movie" one was harder to find than it looked!!

And reminds me to laugh,
On the seventh day, at the zenith of his anguish, David smashed open the cabinet containing his ancestor’s keepsakes and, carefully picking through the shards of glass, retrieved the journal. The boy was found several hours later by the stable master , rifling through the pages of the manuscript, with a look upon his face of someone who had recently discovered first-hand what genitalia were actually for. When he was brought before his Father and Mother with not a trace of shame visible they both turned a strange purple colour. Almost as a mirror image of one another, shaking bodily, lips tightly pursed with the occasional squealing expulsion of air escaping them, accompanied by something guttural and constrained that started In each of their throats and differed only slightly in pitch. Then came the roaring – a twin stream of high volume words that crashed against one another and knocked David arsewards in ecstasy. To him the cacophony was like a choir of angels, as if heaven had split the sky and emptied all the wonders of existence directly into his ears with enough force to split his skull.

Gang Gang Dance's latest album takes its time kicking into gear, opening with the slow-burning, 11-minute "Glass Jar," which builds from a low-key synth drone into a pulsing, structurally complex electro-pop dance tune. It's hard to remember at this point that Gang Gang Dance once dealt in weird, semi-improvised jams where bursts of rock or fractured pop burst organically and sporadically from the surrounding thickets of abstract noise and psychedelic formlessness. The opener of Eye Contact provides a reminder of those origins, building only gradually towards the polished, quirky avant-pop that is the band's current specialty. This is the band's slickest and cleanest record, continuing the trajectory they've been on ever since 2005's God's Money and 2008's Saint Dymphna (still probably their best record, by just a slight margin). The sound is airy and percussively throbbing, with singer Lizzie Bougatsos cooing and sighing over glistening 80s pop homages ("Chinese High"), ethnic music mash-ups ("Thru and Thru"), and dancefloor bangers ("MindKilla") alike. Despite this sonic diversity, the songs flow seamlessly together in a unified suite, joined together at times by shorter instrumental sections that again recall the band's jammier early days. [buy]
If you’re very lucky and successful, then you can release a triple CD, LP, whatever but, before the DVD and Blu-Ray came, there was no physical support for a three hours long release on a single support. Now it’s over a decade the DVD is available but, as far as I know, at least in the “extreme Metal scene”, nobody ever released a DVD-only, three hours long album, you see? An “album” is a business concept inherited from 70 years of music industry, nothing more, nothing less. It has nothing to do with “an artistic point of view”.

Things would have been far different in Japan if the country had admitted large numbers of, say, Malays or Pakistanis. So far, Japan has wisely limited Third-World immigration, and can face a catastrophe with the conviction that all Japanese are united both in suffering and in the struggle to rebuild. Japan is far better prepared to face calamity than America or Europe because Japan has had the wisdom to remain Japanese.
i have added an empty plastic bin on the top that i throw clothes in that are outgrown between seasons, or holiday clothes that need to be put away. i am not dragging out that box on the bottom just to put away one halloween shirt. so, i throw it in the empty bin and when spring comes and i'm "rotating" clothes, i'll put away whatever is in the empty bin at that time. this saves me from having random piles in the laundry room of "i don't know what to do with these clothes right now" clothes.
There is only one way in which this phenomenon can be explained. The sacramental act was regarded as the appointed means of expressing the faith, which it concentrated on the specific provision of divine grace; and therefore it was the means whereby the spiritual grace of regeneration was received while it was also a pledge that assured us of its reception. To say this is not to affirm, in accordance with the second of the three views of the relation of regeneration to the sacrament stated above, that the ordinance is a mere symbol of the spiritual experience, or a public confession that it has taken place. This explanation of the case is forbidden by the fact that the spiritual benefits symbolised by the ordinance are invariably spoken of in the New Testament as being realised in and through the ordinance. The ordinance is nowhere described as a mere sign of a spiritual benefit independently realised, and Protestants do untold damage to their cause when they put themselves in the position of having to explain away numerous clear and definite expressions to this effect. The true statement of the case would seem to be, that regeneration is conditioned upon faith in Christ and His atoning work; while Baptism has been appointed to concentrate that faith upon the specific features of that atonement, and to give it definite expression when so concentrated. Thus, in strictly normal cases the moment of the believing reception of Baptism would be the moment of regeneration, but in many cases the faith may precede the ordinance, with the result that the spiritual regeneration will take place before Baptism, as in the instance of Cornelius and his friends. Where this occurs the ordinance will be the outward and formal expression of a faith already existing (Rom. iv. 11; Col. ii. 11); and on God’s side the pledge assuring us of a benefit already received. It will be to the Christian very much what his coronation was to our King. It did not make him king, yet it was the complement of his accession, and who will say that it was unnecessary to the recognition of his kingly position? Besides this, Baptism will be the sacramental admission of the recipient into the spiritual society called the Christian Church, which the kingdom of heaven upon earth identifies itself with, and by which he is assured of the enjoyment of all the rights of our heavenly citizenship.
There's clearly much research in the way the whole piece is constructed and those who spend time on the topics will be able to take the debate much further than the 80 minutes allowed. It's still a powerful way to approach the topic and register some of the baseline points.

Libreville, recorded again in two extended sessions between August and December 1982 at Bootleg Studio was more or. The band was now performing frequently around Manchester and London. The material on Libreville was more focused and less reliant on chance occurrence with the ten minute funk-bass driven First Use All The G's a stand out. Aaircare proved a particular favourite with live audiences. Although recorded for New Hormones as ORG 26, the album was eventually released on Paragon after New Hormones ran out of money.

What is collateral damage? To Tirman, it is civilian deaths, largely underestimated. He quotes statistics on the war in Iraq: “In 2006, two separate household surveys, by the Iraqi Ministry of Health and by researchers from Johns Hopkins University, found between 400,000 and 650,000 ‘excess deaths’ in Iraq as a result of the war. At the time, however, the commanding general in Iraq put the number at 50,000 and President Bush had claimed in late 2005 that it was just 30,000.”

We thus see how this event is intimately tied to the lion hunt and its resulting miracle of the red lotus, which we celebrated last month. But, you’ll note that there is nothing in here that directly compares Antinous to any of the flower-figures from other Greek myths. In the fragments that have likewise been conjectured to be from Pancrates’ poem in P. Oxy. 8 and a papyrus fragment now in London, there is likewise no mention of any flower-figures.

The images of official responses have been equally familiar: clampdowns by quasi-militarised police, media campaigns which attempt to criminalise protest, and images of young protestors being pepper-sprayed or bombarded by water cannons – police infrastructures that were designed for endless wars on crime and terror being pointed inward at ordinary citizens. Last week in Cape Town was no different.

An apology means absolutely nothing coming from someone who was forced to give it. I highly doubt Soulja Boy is going to be remorseful after all the extra hits this song gets on YouTube and iTunes. And I'm even more doubtful that any of the men and women who are serving in the military at this very moment really care about the lyric or the "apology" that followed. I think they're too busy doing something incredibly important with their time. Maybe we should follow their example. Stop caring so much about inane statements from insignificant people. Because the demand for the apology is just as ridiculous and insignificant as the statement and the subsequent "apology." Enough with the apologies.

This recipe can be made as a loaf, as pictured, or individual muffins, and you can substitute the raisins for a cup of something else (prunes would be nice). Fennel is an acquired taste, I admit, being the Marmite of flavourings, but the liquorice warmth balances the sweetness here. Play around with spices though, and see what takes your fancy. I have added ground almonds to the mix because I believe that the muffin’s downfall is its tendency to dryness which almonds will mitigate. If you are less catholic in your muffin persuasion, and want to keep things simple, stick to two cups (250g) of flour.

This loss of love is seen even more acutely in that a fundamentalist lens leads people to be suspicious and lack grace toward others in the church. Fundamentalism, when primary, creates a culture of critical inspection that fails to remember that is only by God’s grace and through his Spirit that people’s minds and hearts are transformed into complete and glad submission to the Father’s will. Jesus says in John 13:35 that the mark of discipleship is the love within his body toward one another. What happens when fundamentalism seeps into church leadership is that the effort to uphold right behavior and doctrine actually creates a culture that is opposed to Christ’s standard for how the church is to live.

I run the repeats on a treadmill, instead of an actual track. (Most schools don’t take kindly to strange adults on the track during school hours.) Before the workouts, using the charts in the book, I look up the designated time for each interval distance (400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1600 meters). I convert those times into both minutes-per-mile and miles-per-hour, so that I can set the treadmill to the appropriate speed for my intervals.

Andy’s bungled confession to MIX (“I want to fill your hole!”) was priceless; he consistently gets some of the best lines of all his peers. Also, Zessica tells Mikono straight up “he’s all yours,” and while she won’t give up loving him, she’s at least moving on, or at least trying to. Hopefully this will mean her character can evolve beyond full-time Amata-piner; after all, she’s a pretty good fighter. Her new outfit is even more ridiculous than her last – she just isn’t capable of covering more than 45% of her boobs.
The first bite was like an epiphany. I don’t believe I have ever eaten anything like this before! I think I’m beginning to develop a love for cakes that contain chunks of fruits you can bite into (like the last Dorie Greenspan recipe I shared that contained mangoes). This cake is simply delicious. The tangy orange flavour on the cake is absolutely perfect eaten with the sweet, juicy plums resting on top. And then I am reminded this is actually a Dorie Greenspan recipe. Frankly, that’s really all one needs to know to wipe away the fears and doubts! But if that’s not enough, then all the amazing feedback from the blogosphere is more than enough encouragement. I know that’s one of the things that pushed me to finally make this.

Earlier in the year, I applied Iron Sulphate to my lawn, It killed the moss, turned it black and made a very ugly mess. I came along with my springtine rake, scraped the dead moss out and made even more of a mess. I have to say, I was sorely tempted to rip it all up and re-turf it, BUT along came the hosepipe ban.

Often, as we passed the museum's front doors, Josephine would say something like, "I want to see Jesus whacking those guys," and we would divert ourselves from the sidewalk to a painting (I'm sorry I don't know by whom) of Christ driving the money lenders from the temple. We would often just sit on one of the benches "watching" a painting like one does a television, talking about what we saw. I specifically recall Josephine taking a shine to a work by Cindy Sherman, a contemporary artist who photographs herself in often bizarre and disturbing, but always arresting tableaus. In particular, I recall a piece in which she was apparently a queen breast-feeding a baby. We had a story we told one another about this, repeating it and adding to it each time we visited. It was meaningful to us that the queen was not looking at her baby, but instead looking pointedly "off camera," at something else that held her attention.
I have a friend who is an avid bird photographer. Tonight he posted a picture he took of a white-faced ibis, which I’m given to understand is a very rare sight in the northern latitudes.

“I think maybe the Isle of Man is too small to be a country,” I said. “It’s like Ireland. Almost everyone in any position of power in Dublin seems to have gone to school or college or is very matey with everyone else in any position of power. The place is inherently corrupt because it is too small.”
AAM: And that is not completely accurate. And it is also not accurate to think—and this is where the confusion comes, because you are applying the linear understanding of the human race. Let me really shock you tonight and say to you that you can be in form, in your human form—as you think of your enlightenment journey—and still be connected, consciously, in that place of full connection to the heart of One.

Another common sentiment is "it's not fair. I don't know anything about video/marketing/queries/etc." Sure it's fair. If you were expected to design a bridge or rebuild a carburetor as part of the publishing process, that would be unfair. You're a creative. If you can learn to write a book, you can learn to make a trailer, or at least learn to get a trailer made. The good news is no one expects you to change their lives in sixty seconds or 250 words. Refer to the above: convey the essence of your work. Be exciting. That's it!

No one can deny Leanne performed a tender rendition of Pink’s song, though the problem was that it was forgettable. If she wants to crush the competition with her voice and tell people she is ‘here’ then she needs powerful tracks with a mix of genre. In other words not all ballads, though not all power bursters where she just stands there, as this can harm her later on in the series.
REASONS TO STAY: Kind of dry in places.

Muharram this year had been toned due due to government restrictions and so this year, the groups of walkers were a lot less. Nevertheless, we did see about 3-4 big groups of people walking and reciting poems and lamentations. I was surprised at how many elderly, children, full-term-pregnant women and disabled people were doing the walk. There were also hundreds walking barefoot too. I was told that in previous years, people stand by the roadside and hand out water and refreshments too, but we only saw a truck handing out bananas this year!
Getting out the camera, I asked my boys how to make chocolate covered strawberries. They explained it in the simple terms that only 6 year olds can.

One of the key points that I’ve already picked up from my new abstract book (see previous post) is that it’s more than ok to repeat a lesson, in fact it’s almost always worthwhile repeating it so that ‘good practice’ becomes a habit.

You may remember I took a shot of this spot after a particularly bad storm we had during our 'wet' season just back at the end of March. It looked like we had installed a strange looking swimming pool, as it was completely filled with water.
My father was a farmer before the time of weather forecasting. He knew well those weather patterns and planted his crops, cut his hay and planned his harvesting accordingly. Many a time I heard him say, “a storm is coming” or, “we’re in for a dry spell.” As I recall, he was usually right. By the way, he, too, was a Christian.

My sister died on January 20th, Sarah’s 9-month birthday. She was sixteen. We knew this time was coming, but it’s still a difficult thing to face.
I have used papers from Teresa Collin, Basic Grey Black Dress and other bits and pieces that I had in my stash. I punched out circles of the different papers for the baubles, dressed them in snippets of Prima bling and lace. Cut out the tiniest little squares of black cardstock and placed with a tiny pop dot on the bauble before adhering a pearl and then "drawing" the hanger in Stickles Gold rather than glueing a ribbon or twine.
His coming into the world to reveal the glory of God was for you and me. His death on the cross was for you and me, to save us from sin. His resurrection from the dead was for you and for me, to save us from death. And, now we offer ourselves, not as if we did some great thing. Rather it is the service we owe from gratitude.
The first time I really projected, I wasn’t aware I was projecting. To me, I was just dreaming about flying. I had just had surgery, and had been doped up on a bunch of anesthesia. It was great; I was going through all sorts of loops, turning to and fro and generally just enjoying myself.
I think it was about this time too that my new friend Peter, who was a really positive influence in moving me forward, came to my house for the first time and we took my minpin, Spart for a long walk. I showed Peter my basement, piled with all sorts of stuff from the boat, plus a very extensive shop area Rob had set up in our basement. I had more tools than you could shake a stick at! Peter looked around, was just blown away at all the “stuff” and he said “wow! this basement is like an advertisement of how not to live your life!”. I had to agree.

This week we are back to temperatures in the high 70's, getting up to 80 some days. Good thing I left some summer clothes out for the kids. Our Halloween decorations are out and this weekend we're heading to a farm with some friends and then to a hayride/fall party with Eric's parents.
Goldie and The Gingerbreads blazed the trail for countless of female musicians including the Go-Gos, the Bangles, The Runaways, and Luscious Jackson. Over time, the group has been immortalized in various rock music anthologies and most recently in The Rolling Stone Book of Women In Rock (Random House, 1997). Fellar musicians and journalist gave their appreciation for these ladies that paved the way for generations to come.
Yet it’s marvellous how secretive a woman can be, hiding the scars and wounds and taking them to the grave. I wonder is there ever a time when it’s ok to share the secret of an abortion? So many people have done it and lived to regret it, but it’s a time when a woman is at her most vulnerable, but for many comfort comes from strangers.

The United States Postal Service revealed a plan last week that could keep thousands of small-town post offices open by reducing hours. That’s certainly better than the alternative for places like Hope, Minnesota, an unincorporated community just off Interstate 35 south of Owatonna in Steele County. Last summer Hope’s 120 residents learned that their post office, like thousands of others across the country, likely would close in a cost-cutting measure.

I suppose this is nothing new, however, the Catholic Church persecuted Galileo for daring to suggest the Earth orbited the Sun after all. No, but what did sicken me, was the vitriolic tone of his article. He used all the old smears that are perpetuated by the likes of Searchlight, an organization established for the sole purpose of attacking nationalist parties, and funded by the government. This is hardly befitting of a man of the cloth!

Not everyone chooses this path however, and they will be the ones that remain static and continue as they always were. For a few others, the catalyst will ignite a gradual change in the way life is viewed. A long period of self-analysis will follow and inevitably, this will result in finding truths about your Self that you never knew, or that you simply kept buried deep within your psyche. You may find, to your dismay, that who you thought you were no longer jives. And as a result, you may begin to feel lost. For the lucky ones, this is the beginning of the long and lonely road to self-actualization – that innate drive that propels you towards becoming the best that you can be.

It has been three and a half years since my son, Zach, was born. October 14, 2008 to be exact. I will never forget the day, where I was standing, and what I felt when I heard the words "I have reason to believe your son might have Down Syndrome." I was in complete shock and remember feeling like the hospital room just closed in on me. I remember the numbness I felt as people came to the hospital to visit...I would find myself lost in conversation one minute and crying the next as I thought "This is real. This is my life now. I have a child with Down Syndrome." I remember the feelings of sadness, grief, loss and at moments, despair. Could I handle this? This kind of thing happened to really strong people...not people like me! I remember Phillip and I weeping and voicing our prayers out loud to the Lord while kneeling by our couch when we came home from the hospital. I remember wondering how long it would take before I could say the words "Down Syndrome" and not cry. I wondered if that day would ever come.

After getting changed upstairs - including the very careful application of my new tights - it was downstairs to help set up. Luckily I'd remember a knife to carve the french sticks I'd brought along and with the weather being so cold, it kept the chilled items suitably cool in the back of the car. Not that I enjoyed fetching them in the blustery weather.
– Shift your focus to Christ crucified, risen, and ascended.When guilt persists, remember where Jesus is and where he’s been. He has been upon the cross, where he spoiled all that can ruin us. He’s now upon the throne of heaven, as our advocate and mediator. His state in glory doesn’t make him neglectful or scornful of the guilty sinners he died to redeem. He has the same heart now in heaven as he had upon the cross.
To date, I’ve written 4 short stories and I have 2 more that I really want to get completed. I’ve learned a few things during this process. For example, I can’t write humor. My hat is off to those of you who can.
But Fire With Fire started running into problems in the second act. If you read the site often, you know I like clean narratives. I like when we know what the story is about and where it’s going. For example, The Disciple Program. We know what that story is about. It’s about a man getting revenge on the men who murdered his wife.
I had fun, I learned a little bit, and I forced myself to be motivated even when it was the last thing I wanted. In the end, that’s all I really wanted to accomplish. But the real win for this sort of thing will be if I can take this “all day, every day” mentality and continually apply it to the other, less public projects I have going on in my life, or my pursuit of life as an entertainer/actor/writer/whatever. Which means the real benefits of having completed this project may not become clear until five years from now. Which is good, because if I’m still single five years from now, I’m gonna need all the benefits I can get. Wink.

For example, Weizman outlines what the Israeli Defense Forces call "hot pursuit"—that is, to "break into Palestinian controlled areas, enter neighborhoods and homes in search of suspects, and take suspects into custody for purposes of interrogation and detention." This becomes a spatially extraordinary proposition when you consider that someone could be kidnapped from the 4th floor of a building by troops who have blasted through the walls and ceilings, coming down into that space from the 5th floor of a neighboring complex—and that the abductors might only have made it that far in the first place after moving through the walls of other structures nearby, blasting upward through underground infrastructure, leaping terrace-to-terrace between buildings, and more.

Nekoka and Sassafrass love the flowers. I like them well enough, but I don’t understand why he gives me flowers. I mean he lived with me twenty-some years. Did he ever see me go, “wow I love flowers!” I don’t mean to sound petty or ungrateful. I’m just confused at how he makes these choices.
As much as I love a good story it’s sometimes nice to lose yourself in someone else’s memoirs. Often that someone is a celebrity or somebody you admire. In the case of ‘The Hare With Amber Eyes’ the main focus of the book is a collection of small Japanese ceramic figurines called netsuke.
Before the first shots of the American Revolution resounded at Lexington and Concord, the Colonies gathered information via American merchant ships and whalers. Ascertaining British naval strength and a general sense of their deployments around the globe was easy enough, but as the Revolution progressed, it became more important to know where British war ships and troop transports were destined.

As I was talking to the two women assigned to me, I felt like I do many times when I talk to people about my life. As I said in my last post, it's been extraordinarily ordinary. But sometimes, it's been downright boring (not necessarily to me, but boring-sounding when I talk about it with others). I haven't had any major trauma or drama in my life. Yes, there were things that I thought were incredibly dramatic in my life-- breakups with boys, fights with friends, a bad grade on a final exam. But in "the grand scheme of things" as many like to say, those things were small in comparison to what a lot of people go through.

The more accepted approach for activism in the United States has been to put public pressure on the fashion industry to change, without government intervention. Some have answered the call for change, such as Dove, which launched the Campaign for Real Beauty in 2004 and a viral video entitled ‘Evolution’ in 2006, which shows the unbelievable transformation of an ‘ordinary’ woman into a Photoshopped super-woman. Its model of positive advertising has brought the brand attention, but it doesn’t appear to have caught on in the wider advertising or media industries, which are still Photoshopping away….”

The activity for the physical dimension was to go to the Wellness Center and do at least thirty minutes of cardiovascular exercise. I chose to do this activity because I have been working to get into better shape and lose some weight as per request of my physician. I had only been to the Wellness Center a few times before Sunday because my family gave m a membership to a different gym that I can access 24/7 (I have a weird work schedule) for Christmas. I was a little concerned that it would be too busy for my comfort, (as it has been in the past when I’ve gone) but it wasn’t. I am not a fan of working out around a whole lot of people or with groups of people for some reason. I ended up doing thirty-five minutes on the elliptical/crossramp machine with a couple of minutes of stretching on either end. Exercising makes me feel more focused and just better in general, so that definitely helps me concentrate on my class work, and I sleep better at night which gives me more energy during the day.
I said all this to my sister last night and she said I wasn't to flatter myself they were coming to see me, it was because of the baby. Apparently people with babies are always desperate to 'get out' even if it means going to visit hormonal old bags and eat hairy cakes.
Brolin's character lacked any depth whatsoever. I guess I might be a little bias since I'm not a big fan of Josh Brolin (although to be fair, his character in "No Country for Old Men" was very good and convincing. I felt as though the pompous character was all lines, all ambition, but no reality. He was so quick to quiver in the face of adversity. And it's not that there aren't characters like that in other movies (a la Bud Fox from the prequel), but he wasn't portrayed in that way all along, and therefore it did not fit in as being a character trait of his. Brolin's portrayal of a one-dimensional character (written that way), showed a lack of creativity (much as he did with George W. Bush in "W") and ended up making his character have little to no effect on the movie. It's not that his character wasn't involved in the movie, but I didn't care if he continued making money, went to jail, or jumped out of the office window.

Unless you live under a rock, you have probably heard about The Ryan Plan. The Ryan Plan for balancing the budget would set into motion a series of austerity cuts that would mostly effect the poor, and as a result might, and that is a big might, help us balance the budget. But tax cuts for the wealthy would remain in place. Is this fair? Should fairness matter in the debate?

When I gave her the reigns more and more I expected some mishaps that needed guidance and I wanted to set her up for success. When she began to pee in the wrong place I cued, “WAIT!” and rushed her to the bathroom and asked her to finish even if it seemed like she was empty. A puddle anywhere but the bathroom toilet or potty was approached with normal displeasure and disapproval and I always had her help make it right–but I didn’t give over praise since it was expected behavior. She needed the freedom to test her bladder limits and indepedent skills with reasonable boundaries. At the same time, I wanted to protect my house and I took precautions like putting a puddle pad on the couch if she wanted to sit there, removing the throw rug on our hardwood floors, putting her in training pants if I couldn’t be attentive enough to allow some leeway (while I was cooking, for example, and it had been a while since the last deployment), and reducing her wandering area to a manageable space if she was bare bottomed.
Well, I’ve hit a hole in my work-in-progress, a possible weakness. The hero of this whimsically ironic apocalyptic novel, Chip, loses one person after the other until he is alone. (I’m not giving anything away here. I already told you the work was apocalyptic.) There will be plenty of conflict as he contends with his new environment, but it might get boring without other characters for him to interact with.
Of course, not everything changed; we still stubbornly rejected the trappings of a traditional wedding. We slunk off to City Hall, our baby son in arms, and “eloped,” to use a quaint old word. The judge was a trim, diminutive, mannish woman of late middle years, and her eyes held a reassuring twinkle that said to me, Hey, I’m not taking this too seriously either. I didn’t tell my parents; we hardly told anyone. A year later my mother visited and accidentally saw our marriage certificate hanging in the back of my closet. “What?!” she cried. “You got married and didn’t tell me?”
The cows and birds and dogs did not eat at all. The cow snacked on a bit of grass and the puppy on a bread crust around 12ish when the tv said that the “grahanam had just left” and then they lay down and did not eat. The crows cawed somewhat morosely.

From the Just For Today Daily meditation:
I've used a base of aqua card (it's SU, but I have no idea what it's called sorry!), layered with Very Vanilla and another piece of aqua that has been stamped with JustRite's Chevron Stripe Background stamp in Versamark ink. It's been a while since I've played with versamark, but I like the way it worked for this. The middle panel is another piece of vanilla - stamped with the roses from With Sympathy in Celadon Versacolor Ink. Across this is a darker piece of aqua bazzill, punched with Deco Fan and topped with white crochet lace (airbrushed with E53 Copic - because I don't have any ivory lace!). The feature panel is vanilla stamped with the frame and sentiment from With Sympathy and then coloured with BG72 and BG75 and cut out with Nested Oval Medallion Dies. I've framed this with dark aqua cut with Lacey Oval Nestabilities and popped it all up with X-press It High Tack Foam Tape. To finish I've made a flower using vanilla and Bitty Blossoms Shapeabilities (new toy! I can see I'm going to use this A LOT!) and a bit of greenery using Foliage Shapeabilities.
Last week the Brazilian Intellectual Property Office (INPI) announced the granting of geographical indication (GI) to ‘Cachoeiro de Itapemirim ‘ for marble. Producers of Itapemirim will now have a period of 60 days- from the notification day, to pay the fee for the issuance of the certificate and thus completing the formality of this process.

About the only time I wish she would hurry up and learn to read is when she asks me (for the 10th time in 20 minutes) what her computer says. Without trying to read it first.
Sometimes I think I'd like to move back to south, but then I remember how 99% of the black people seem to hate you and want to give you a hard time. It is not hard to find someone eager to beat you to a pulp, kill you, or rob you--because of race. Racism is the curse. That and belligerent ignorance. Life is hard so it must be your fault.
Thanks to her I met Yo who is the official transletor of the company. He is also very nice and I found out he actually studied the same I did and in the same uni. That is not the best: he has the same business plan ideas I have!!!!!!! Of course I mean ‘China & foreign trade’ and he speaks Chinese!! Did I finally have a business partner???
Put your buckets next to your transplants. Move your bucket around your transplants each time you fill them to encourage root growth in all directions. When you fill your transplant bucket you can add root stimulation powder or fertilizer as needed, but don’t over fertilize the first year. You want to encourage root growth that first year not top growth. How often you fill the buckets depends on your local moisture. You want to encourage good deep root growth. It is a bit of guess-work or gut instinct as to how often you fill your buckets. You may need to put a rock in the bottom of the your buckets to hold them in place in windy areas.
The small crowd went silent and I quickly scanned the group looking for any indication of hostility. Thank goodness the man behind me returned to his sand seat but the small group waited for a reply. I slowly said in a low voice, “I’m from the US.”

In 2011, the statistics show that 87% of the NYPD’s almost 700,000 stop-and-frisks involved Black and Latino persons; only 12% of those stops resulted in arrests, and less than 1% of those stops resulted in an arrest for weapon possession or an otherwise violent crime. Council Member Letitia James has joined many of her colleagues in criticizing the stop-and-frisk policy as one that forges distrust between the department and minority communities.

The Love Dare starts with a secret. And though it’s been an unspoken element throughout each day, you’ve likely grown more and more suspicious of it all the time. Now that you’re this far, it’s a secret you’re discovering for yourself, even if you haven’t exactly known how to put it into words.

 More and more job preferences (and other “affirmative action” opportunities as well) – especially cinchy, non-essential, non-mentally challenging, low-pressure, and high-paying civil-service and other government jobs.
This Romney/Gingrich Theory just took on more juice as the word from Fox News is that Gingrich will stay in the race to the bitter end, even if he continues to loose – the only one that Newt Gingrich is helping in doing this is Romney – Gingrich’s voters would most likely split, but the majority going towards Santorum, given Santorum the edge.

Food and Cake: We started the party early and served pancakes. We made the pancakes in the shape of a “J” since my son’s name starts with “J.” We served bacon, fruit, and orange juice on the side. At that time, we also did his “cake.” We made a stack of pancakes with layers of whipping cream in between. My husband put LOTS of whipping cream on the top, and then completed the cake with strawberries and sprinkles. We put candles on top. The kids loved this, and everyone got a taste! (Hint: The whipping cream starts to melt quickly so put this on the fridge or freezer until it’s time!)

What happens when the survival of the program, such as transferring cash to pay salaries and operating expenses, requires the expat and/or the locals to violate the local law? It happens. How specifically does a "Rule of Law" program address the issue? Is it appropriate for a donor supported NGO implementing a donor country’s program to violate local law? When? What are the risks?
The run felt OK today. I was pretty tired from class and a little scared to push it too hard (especially after what happened last Friday), but I finished the run and that felt good. I am eager to start adding mileage to get ready for my June races.
The wall behind the painting is Benjamin Moore's Ferret Brown, which the designer told me ahead of time, so I was able to work in a brown that is close, so that it complements it, and doesn't fight it. This is the nice thing about commissioned paintings, versus buying something off the shelf (plus, employing artists is always a good thing. I may be biased when saying that, though).

The one major thing I disliked about the film though, was its underwhelming special effects. Compared to other blockbusters in its tier, this one’s probably at the bottom half, but I commend them for their effort to prioritize the story more rather than the visuals. And it only goes to show that you can still execute a solid film with a small budget. They still have a couple (or three?) of movies to go, and with all the cash they’re raking right now, they have plenty of room to improve. I just hope Lionsgate will be able to propel the franchise forward instead of back.
I cannot get over how nice the weather was this weekend!

You can use the trays with "cells", but keep in mind that plants grow at different rates - some will outgrow their cells faster than others. You also have the issue of removing them without distrupting the entire tray of seedlings. And you are limited on the size so that roots can only expand so far. I really don't use these and don't recommend them.
The Tea Party, the Religious Right, and the base might demand these amendments, and politicians might gain short-term advantages from promising them, but eventually, the fact that it is virtually impossible to deliver on these promises will come back to bite them. Furthermore, attempts to fulfill these promises might require trading tangible opportunities or policies for doomed votes.

While writing a play on AIDS it is difficult not to be concerned about promoting awareness related to the disease. At the same time if there is too much information in a play presented in a way that makes for dull, uninteresting viewing, then the whole point of writing a play on the subject is lost, for might it not have been better to have expended the energy on producing an information booklet on the subject. And this is one of the frequent and valid criticisms of Governments in the context of AIDS: they handle their literacy campaigns in a dull, unimaginative fashion. Having said this, it is too tempting for someone concerned with the issue not to write a play that apart from entertaining also sends across useful and relevant information. I do not have a medical background and am certainly no expert on AIDS in its social and other manifestations; however for a period of time I was closely associated with a group of individuals in New Delhi whose campaign focused on ending discriminatory treatment of individuals infected with the disease.

With an effective opposition in the legislature, an emboldened civil society, international money laundering investigations and court cases piling up against members of Taib’s network, the existing system could well begin to unravel. The most inevitable factor weighing in against them is Taib’s own mortality. At 75, he is a political veteran who has spent thirty years cultivating his supremacy over Sarawak’s politics and economy, controlling 50% of the Sarawak’s state budget through his additional roles as Minister of Finance and Minister of Planning and Resource Management. This has led to a system that is inefficient and top-heavy, not only in the public sphere but also in the private. Of the conglomerates who dominate Sarawak’s economy, which number less than ten, all have long-standing personal connections to the Chief Minister’s inner circle and rely on his political predominance for lucrative leases and contracts. In a society where political engagement and access to independent news is on the rise, the ruling government finds itself in an impossible situation: increasingly difficult to defend the duplicity of status quo, yet unable to undertake significant reform for fear of losing power.
NOT!!! Publishing an eBook, like a releasing a POD text, is like throwing a book out of a plane into the deepest reaches of the Amazon (pun intended) and hope people will travel there and then send you money after they find it. You guessed it. Not a penny comes your way. Unless…. You let people know exactly where the book is there and then convince them they should buy it, not an easy task but it is doable.
Easy Peasy right ?

Pricing is of course crucial. Publishing companies are often averse to the idea of pricing out of a price point. Many indeed are unable to comprehend the concept of “value-based pricing”. But in a world where a 1% change in price can leverage an 11% increase in profits (assuming volume and fixed costs stay the same), the folly of not understanding value-based initiatives is starkly revealed.

It’s the night before their official public launch and we have been invited to their VIP 5 course degustation dinner to celebrate with a “sneak preview” of what’s to come. The vibe of the restaurant is lively, with efficient, friendly waitresses who double check our orders and upbeat music playing in the background (occasionally with some classical piano tunes mixed in too). After descending the stairs to the main dining area, which has shelves lined with various wine bottles, we are seated on the corner table. The unpolished wooden seats lining the wall are overflowing with plush cushions to alleviate the hardness of the seats and some interesting trinkets like an antique looking globe are also on the side.

I’ve always been blessed with the ability to see the glass as half full and I struggle with people who constantly see the wackness in everything. It’s tiring. I do have patience for people who need a bit of reminding but not for people who are perpetually negative. I choose not to work with people like that. I’ve always advised teams not to hire bad seeds on their teams. Bad seeds affect everybody and bring the group’s spirit’s down. I’d far rather have somebody who performs at 90% but has a great attitude than somebody who’s a 100% performer but negative.
How does this relate to South Africa? Well, Africans, like Europeans, are monarchists at heart, but even more so. South African voters were entirely too easy to convince that government is the repository of all the freedoms that the citizens enjoy, the all-powerful benefactor that is necessary to preserve those freedoms. When freedom is translated into monetary terms, as the ANC has proven itself expert at doing, then true freedom is lost, and the meaning of democracy is subsumed into a kind of mob rule.

Of course, in 2007, then-Senator Obama spoke passionately about the need to go after the Bush administration for violating the War Powers Act — the very same thing he’s doing now. In fact, while speaking at DePaul University in October of 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama said the following:
It’s been an exciting day. I left school early to get to the hospital at about 1:30, and the kid was pretty much ready to go. May and I were more than a bit anxious. Filling out a review of his care for the hospital, we marked that he had very good care for everything, but the last question asked how ready we felt about bringing him home. We joked
I would love to create a school, one day. An academically selective school, but one based on Ken Robinsons views on a need to 'change the paradigm' and encourage 'educational revolution'. I would accept children as young as two or three years old, if they had the ability, but some might not start schooling until eight or ten. For 'primary school' the students will be exposed to all areas of learning - sport, science, arts, humanities and so on - equally, without bias or the notion that one is more important than the other. Children would be grouped purely by ability and aptitude for a particular subject. When a student reached a level we would associate with the start of high school, a few areas of interest and ability will be selected and pursued at a higher level, whilst other subjects are taught purely for application; maths, for example, would be taught with the relevance and application to daily life in mind, as opposed to abstract and complexity that would confuse a child without the inclination. Then when the student reaches the final two years of schooling those subjects will be dropped entirely and only a few subjects will be pursued into a level far beyond what we would associate with high school. There would be no set age for graduating - some might graduate in early teens, others at twenty or later.
This past weekend (20th to 22nd) i was visiting the city of São Paulo to attend to Steven Wilson’s last concert in south america for the Grace For Drowning tour.
