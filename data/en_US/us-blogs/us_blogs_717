To be clear, I started listening to Marty In The Morning long before this move was mooted. His mother, I now know, lives a few doors down from our new home. There can be no doubt that we have been drawn together like this by the Fates. Before now, I assumed that this fatal artistry would lead to a progression from nodding acquaintance through casual conversation to the eventual destination of a unspoken yet deep spiritual bond, which I thought I had already begun to express itself in coded mellow morning messages. But it now appears that our destiny is one of a different hue. He looked up as I approached the gate. Our eyes met. For a brief moment we held a gaze that spoke sparingly of a love that might have been, soured now, to an enmity from which we cannot flee.
It cracks me up that she refuses to say, "binkie". She says it "dinkie". I worked with her one day, saying things like, "B is for binkie, bah, bah, bah-inkie". She would say, "B, bah bah, dee-inkie". She can say the B perfectly, but for some reason she really prefers to say dinkie.

This is the one where you sit down and for three weeks you do nothing but craft this person's entire life history. Where were they born? What was their first word? Did they have a blanket with the tabbie things or with silk? Where they attached to said blanket? And on and on until you know more about this character than you know about yourself. I've seen a lot of people who scour magazines and cut out pictures of what this character could potentially look like. I've even met people who write childhood journals for their characters before even getting to writing the story they're hoping to write. It's very, very thorough.

Hi there! It's Wednesday and it's time for this week's Wednesday Stamp Club Sketch Challenge from My Favorite Things! I have to admit when I saw this week's sketch I was a little bit scared of the two offset panels, but got over the fear once I got to working on my card! I have to say that I LOVE how it turned out! Can I say that :)?

I love to share good beer with other people. Cracking open that beer you’ve been saving is one thing if you’re drinking it alone, but if you’re sharing it around with two or three other people, it’s always more fun. Share it around and pull it apart. What can you taste in the glass, what can the person next to you taste? What food would you drink it with? What would they drink it with? It’s a great way to take the drinking experience beyond the actual drinking, and it’s a great way to expand your vocabulary for taste. They’ll be times when a flavour is on the tip of your tongue, but you just can’t put your finger on what it is, then suddenly your mate says “coffee grounds” and all you can do is face-palm with how obvious it is! Every time you then taste that flavour, you’ll instantly be able to describe it.

whilst a lot of his Grey Hunter shooting was out of range, after some decent rage rolls my Terminators were now within 12". I moved forwards, sending my Command Squad straight at 1 Grey Hunter squad and Rune Priest blasting away a few Space Wolves as they did. Whilst the other 3 Squads blasted the second Rune Priest and attending Squad straight off the board. Then I finished the turn charging the Command Squad in and letting my Emperors Champion pounce on Mikes last Rune Priest, chopping him in two whilst he rest of the squad battered the Grey Hunters to pulp. Good start.

The big difference this time was that the invaders were not Union forces from the north but troops from the Chinese Army pushing up from the Gulf Coast after pulling off the largest amphibious landing in the history of armed human conflict. In the back of his mind, thoughts of hatred for the people of Cuba for allowing their island to be used as the staging point for the invasion radiated through his body causing his hand to shake enough to spill the cup of Earl Grey tea he was sipping. Even though he was a Prime Citizen of the Second American Republic allowing him greater access to rationed items such as the tea, David steadied his hand and carefully lowered the expensive porcelain cup to his patio table.

This seems to be the week in which, film-wise at least, I've revisited films that I technically watched previously but during which I may not have been fully alert the first time around. I saw The Long Day Closes on DVD (though not Region 1; it's not available on video here in the U.S.) a couple of years ago and—being that it was just my first or second Terence Davies film at the time—I was immediately stunned into submission by what I perceived to be a strikingly personal and poetic sensibility. It was certainly not like many other films I had seen before then. But it took this second screening, in a beautiful new 35mm print, for me to truly fall in love with this autobiographical fantasia of a lonely boy growing up in a British surburb, comforted by the cinema and relying on God for possible solace. It's soulful and entrancing. It also seems to be considered by many Davies fans to be a lesser achievement than his previous film, Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988). That's a great film, too, don't get me wrong—but I can only report how I felt, and I felt more of a sense of elevation while watching The Long Day Closes. So I guess I do like it more. (A friend theorizes that those who prefer The Long Day Closes do so mostly on account of its many film references, the implication being that most critics are suckers for movies that, whether intentionally or not, flatter the inner movie nerd in them. Being that I only really identified one snatch of movie-related audio—from Orson Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)—in the film without any help, I will say that that has pretty much nothing to do with my affection for the film whatsoever. Even if that was a part of the film's appeal, it's only a small part, really; The Long Day Closes is hardly just a mere love letter to cinema like, say, Martin Scorsese's Hugo. So, um, no.)
The interfaith movement is something which I’ve touched upon at various times in this blog, both in its good points and in its bad ones. However, it is to be understood that–whatever the positive or negative aspects of the interfaith movement happen to be–interfaith activities are not exactly the playground of syncretism. In fact, a great deal of interfaith activity occurs in a situation in which syncretism is frowned upon entirely. Some interfaith rituals involve practices, prayers, or actions that are drawn from several separate religious streams, but these do not then get carried on in other contexts, they are one-off matters, and they are often only monotheistic or monistic in their basis and favor religions that operate from those dominant theologies. There are some interfaith churches and groups now that do try and practice hybrid–and, therefore, syncretistic–spiritualities, but they are far fewer than the ones that gather together, have discussions, perhaps have workshops which allow people of different religions to hear about or experience aspects of other religions, but then safely return to their own corners and their own religious views without being influenced by (or, in some negative interpretations, “contaminated by”) these other viewpoints. While engaging in interfaith work should strengthen the respect and understanding between different religions and their practitioners, and therefore is not necessarily meant at all to create new and novel syncretic traditions, it is important to note this distinction. Entering into interfaith work with a strong basis in one’s own religion, and leaving it with a greater commitment to one’s own religion, is not at all a bad thing. Unfortunately, some people see interfaith work as a means of proselytizing to other religions and convincing them of the errors of their ways, and thus it can be a difficult position to enter into, especially for those of minority faiths (as all modern pagans and polytheists are).
Later we went to Cafe Europa for dinner. My dad wasn't thrilled with his pasta, but that was probably an ordering fail on his part (lesson--he only likes calamari if it's fried). I had pizza and liked it (half went back for a future meal). We were too full for dessert, but we remedied that in days to come.

Returning to the breakfast room, I looked again at the small vitrines of rather delicate porcelain cylinders regarding a weighty nanny-goat, suckling her kid. On the other side of the room was a similarly solid looking peacock, heavily built in porcelain. It had a slight tear among the carefully moulded feathers which seemed to bring it alive. The animals are MINE by the way, NOT de Waal’s.

It's nowhere near finished so I'm almost embarrassed to post the pics, but it will give you an idea of where we're going. We had to remove the carpet and wood paneling b/c there was water/mold damage in the basement. We put in a drainage system that has eliminated any future damage. The plan is to paint the walls and either stain or paint the concrete (after the carpet glue is removed--we could use some tips on how to do this). Although it looks a little ghetto, the kids love the atmosphere change and I love that it's 68 degrees year round! :)

It was only while constructing the titles that Despins decided upon the co-directing and co-producing credit. As he explains, “Initially, the idea was that Bill was responsible for writing the story and I was supposed to be making the film, but it just naturally fell that we were both jointly making the film. We would both be talking to the actors and the cameraman. So when we finished shooting and I'd put the film together it just seemed natural that there should be a co-directing and co-producing credit. Bill wasn't expecting it, he was very surprised.” While the film was being edited, Despins happened to meet representatives from noted London repertory outlet The Other Cinema, and showed them Duffer in its rough state on the Steenbeck. They snapped it up then and there.

So now we are here, keeping a relatively low key evening. We need to get to bed early tonight, so that we can get off to an early start tomorrow. The plan is to drive the entire length of the Ring of Kerry, and checking out the sites along the way. If the weather cooperates, we are going to take a boat out to the Skelligs. So I am praying for some great weather tomorrow, or at least for the time we will arrive at the site. If time allows, we are also going to check out the Cliffs of Moher tomorrow before going to Galway. If not tomorrow, we definitely will on Wednesday.

This book was hard to read. Not in the way that Ulysses is hard to read without a tour guide, or in the way that reading the Ramayana in the original Sanskrit would be hard for me to read (impossible-style, as I can't read Sanskrit). What I really mean is that this book was hard to read without crying. It was uncomfortable, unpleasant, even painful. Reading about grief is difficult. It's too private. Or maybe it's just me? I don't know, but it really brought me down.

And then a bunch of socks and underwear--although this dye doesn't really fade much, after a couple years, things begin to look paler and worn, so I toss them in and re-dye them and keep doing that until they get holes and get tossed. I hate that because then there's the whole dyeing-a-bunch-of-little-loads thing unless I save up more clothes in the to-be-dyed pile. Right now there is no pile--for the first time in a long time, I've gotten everything dyed. Whew.
We know by scars and the heartless manner her ears were cut that Lula suffered abuse. The first few months were spent diligently monitoring every move and reaction, trying to assess her personality. We divided the house using baby gates to separate Lula and my eight pound cat any time we left - the kitty seemed genuinely terrified. We saw Tempest swat at Lula many times and assumed the aggression she was only reacting to something the dog did. I’m sure there is an animal translation of “I’m telling” or “She’s looking at me !”…..Until one night we came home from dinner to find the cat had jumped a gate into Dog Territory and they were lying next to each other when we walked in the door.

This clause might say that the publisher will 'endeavour' to show the author's name on the cover, etc. This is not acceptable. They have the power actually to do it, and to make it a condition of any co-edition agreement. Make sure it does say it will be on the cover and title page - occasionally a publisher will miss your name off the cover, and some will even miss it off the title page. It is vitally important that you get your name on the title page as you need that in order to claim PLR in the book. If it is not mentioned in the contract, make sure you get it added. If you don't remember what PLR is, there is an earlier post on it and an article in the Bookseller about the importance of registering.

Pay attention, now. I'm about to show you what went wrong on Round #1. The dough seemed stiff to me. As I always do, I turn my oven to WARM for a minute, shut it off. I put the dough into an oiled bowl (this is a dough doubler, with measuring lines and a tight lid-- another gadget for me). I figured this would rise in 45-60 minutes.

We ARE modern-day prophets. We seek out the truth and share it. It might piss some people off, but we’re not here to piss you off, just uncover the lies and praise the good. We’re there to help track the bad guy and tell the story of those left hurting. We assist in finding the truth and sharing it with the masses. We are public figures, even if we’re not elected to a public office. Because we are your voice. YOUR VOICE! The ones who say what you’re thinking, the ones who put the thoughts on paper and share it with the world. We’re the ones who get the government to react, the public to take notice, the every day man to realize he might have a health problem to check. We are modern-day historians. We write history – as it happens.

As for the sprockets and cogs of how this game will run I propose that, following character generation and the posting of all the character sheets, I will take a few days to figure out what’s going on with these characters then I will post the first turn. Players will have roughly two days to react to the turn, as I will attempt to post a new turn every other week day for each game on alternate days.
The most effective tactic may be to play on a man's insecurities in bed.

The one design rule I’ll never break is that homes should look like the people who live in them.

Now writers are moving outside the constraints set by these genres, and they are refusing to pigeonhole their works. With the once stringent boundaries and formulas between genre and literary fiction shifting and crumbling, it will be interesting to see what the future holds for Canadian Literature.

Red shoes certainly get you noticed, and the eye is immediately drawn to them.The little boy on the right was painted in 1810, and this work now hangs in the Stadtmuseum, Berlin. The artist is unknown, but the title is 'Boy With Drum'. the drum stands out almost three-dimensionally from the picture, due to the bright colours, in contrast to the child’s white dress, but you can’t help noticing the little red shoes he’s wearing too. Without these the painting would not be quite so interesting.

Author Bio:
Jerel was one of the most frustrating players in the country to scout because of the way that he underachieved this season. He took plays off and that turned a lot of scouts off. With the Packers he’ll be playing the 5 technique and looks like a perfect fit to start next to BJ Raji. He can get to the QB and stop the run. The Packers veterans won’t allow or put up with him taking plays off, so I don’t think that will be to much of an issue going forward. I think the Packers got a steal with the Worthy pick.
Once that was cleaned up, I noticed another BIG problem. Actually, I had noticed it long ago but was in denial, hoping that drastic editing of the elements would somehow solve my problem or may be help me fake it. No such luck.
In so far as the operating system is concerned, the laptops being distributed come equipped with the Linux based operating system. Ubuntu 10.10 is distributed as free and open source software. The decision of the government to avail the open source option is important for several important reasons. Firstly, it reduces dependence on proprietary software vendors and secondly it drastically cuts down on the overall cost of the machines. Since they are not bundled with expensive licensed software such as Microsoft Office they are cost-effective and provide value for money, an important factor for the government to consider which has an inherent responsibility and fiduciary duty to the taxpayers. Open source is also a catalyst for development as it allows users to adapt the software to their own needs. This can improve IT and programming skills that in turn promote innovation. The Ubuntu OS comes installed with Libre Office and the internet browser Firefox. Additional software that is not installed by default can be downloaded and installed using the Ubuntu Software Center without paying any additional charges – an added bonus, since this would be illegal with proprietary software. Also, Ubuntu does not need an antivirus as its kernel is designed in such a way that no spam or virus can affect it. UBUNTU is getting popular globally due to its open source and freeware feature. It is not only being used by students but the LINUX enterprise OS offerings are being used by world renowned education institutes for their enterprise deployments and universities in Pakistan are also using it. The primary purpose to bundle the UBUNTU OS in the machines was to save cost and promote students to take advantage of this free OS which has some great features, is easy to use and comes with a UBUNTU Liber Office (just like MS office) and also has the world renowned Fire Fox Internet Browser (similar to MS Internet explorer). The Punjab Government has also saved cost on bundling MS Office which is even more expensive that Windows OS. Ubuntu also has another advantage; it does not need an Antivirus as its Kernel is designed is such a way that no Spam or Virus can affect it which in turn saves cost. The selection of bundling the UBUNTU was done in order to take advantage of all the features free of cost to the government. In this regard, it is further advised to instruct all educational institutions to discourage any ads that are placed on their notice boards with regard to installation of the Windows OS as the people who are offering the students to install a Windows OS for Rupees 500/- are also using pirated versions and thus misguiding the students. Furthermore, a DVD has been provided with every laptop which contains drivers for not only UBUNTU but Windows OS as well. The DVD also contains details of 9 service and support centers that have been established in order to cater for student’s support and service issues at all the 9 divisional headquarters. A toll free number and web address has also been provided to facilitate the students to log their complaints online.

Before you even think it, I have tried it, so baby, I can knock it. I have given anal its fair shake with a handful of different partners on the off chance that my displeasure was related to the partner I was with. It was not. In my opinion, were anal to be pleasurable then shitting would be orgasmic and I have never had an O while taking a poo so nope, it ain’t for me. Not to say that some people don’t dig it, cause I know they do for any multitude of reasons. Some people dig the discomfort, some people just enjoy the taboo, some people the submission and some people are just…well…into shit. To them I say have at! Enjoy it! Rip yourself a new asshole, quite literally if you like.
It is a whetstone to duty. O thou Christian that art much in private, that settest hours apart for God, (a sign he hath set thee apart) thou sheddest many tears in thy closet: the world takes no notice; but remember, God’s eye is upon thee, thy prayers are registered, thy tears are bottled up, ‘and he that sees in secret will reward thee openly.’ How should this add wings to prayer, and oil to the flame of our devotion?

One was the appearance of the Little People, the other was an increasing failure to stop the spread of fundamentalism. The climax of the story told of the slow emergence of the otherworldly (though comical) Little People from the mouths of the dead radicals after the gunfight in Lake Motosu, and their spinning of an air chrysalis to carry the villainous leader of the radical faction. It was a quite extraordinary "retrieval" scene, though previews of it were already witnessed a few times in the previous books.
As Heller's personal popularity has declined so has his lead over Shelley Berkley. He led her 51-38 in January, now that advantage is only 46-43. What was a 28 point advantage with independents then is now only 3 points at 44-41. And where he was winning over 20% of the Democratic vote back in January, now he gets only 11% across party lines.

The disclosure of Lemelson does absolutely nothing to advance the teachings of March nor to overcome the deficiencies of March by suggestion modification of the structure of March to meet the limitations of these claims. Lemelson is, in fact, nearly identical in subject matter disclosure to that of March. Lemelsons "medicinal materials" (a term selected in the rejection to imply a teaching far broader than that actually enabled by Lemelson) are again molecular materials. At no time does Lemelson suggest "delivery of cells," structure in the underlying device for delivery of cells, or any other function or structure that has been clearly shown to be absent from the teachings of March.

Papeete is Tahiti and French Polynesia's capital city and for years it's had a bad rap of being a polluted, grungy embarrassment to the rest of the stunningly beautiful country. This is changing. I live an hour and a half away from Papeete and go there about once or twice a month so I've had a real perspective on how vastly the city has changed over the last year or so.
Today was grandparents day at my daughter's school. It's her final one actually as she is in Year 6. My Dad dutifully attends this event every year. He takes the morning off work, rocks up in his suit, eats his hot-cross bun and heads back to the office. My parents live an hour away and it's a rather convoluted trip to the office.
Still, ten months later, I still have days where I cannot believe that this is my reality. That my child is dead. I am happier now, but there are still days where that pain is just below the surface. Now that I am pregnant again, I find it resurfacing even more. The tears are easier to surface. I miss my old self, the ability to be blissfully excited about this new life growing within me. I am overjoyed to have this chance to bring our third child into this world, but I'm moving forwardly cautiously with a heart that is afraid to get broken again.

I love Sesame Street characters. No matter how old I get, I seem to not ever get tired of Sesame Street muppets. I don’t look so great in orange as I look better in summer colors based on color analysis, but this is one of the few items I wear outside of my colors.
Unfortunately, I snoozed through my alarm, and am absolutely exhausted today, and the thought of wearing a pencil skirt and fitted shirt just killed me. Killed me, I say! Not to mention that I hadn't ironed said fitted shirt. And the skirt requires a slip. Plus there's something about about a cute outfit that makes me feel like my mood has to live up to it...and it probably wasn't going to manage that today.
I vow not to play the game that the Capitol has set up for me, but to rebel against the power, with all of my humanity remaining intact.

The monumental changes you will make beginning right now will, when you look back upon them, be stunning. Daily observation only reveals great upheavals. Normal growth and change is unremarkable.

I thought about it for a second and said, I’m going to do it. I knew by that time in my life that if I ever got a great adventure idea I better do it or end up saying someday, someday. Three days later I told my brother John the idea and he said, we’re going to do it right. I said, we have to set a date. John and I really wanted to do it but setting the date made sure we started. He was graduating from the U of M on June 15th and we set the date to walk out of town Saturday, June 20th. 1970.
It's been a long time coming home, but we finally made it! The journey was tough, but God is faithful and He has revealed himself to us in ways we never could have imagined. Can't wait to tell you more when I find the words, boy do I have some stories to tell!

In very short order we hear of a magic ointment that can turn a person into an animal, and without a moment's hesitation Prudentius becomes an ass only to learn that the ointment is meant for nighttime use. In order to undo the spell he must eat rose petals, but before he can find them he is discovered and treated as the ass he is, forced to eat hay and live the life of a beast of burden. From here it is one event after another, where Prudentius the ass is sold, beaten by a mean boy, stolen by thieves, all the while maintaining his human capacity for human thought and feeling but only able to bray. At last Prudentius is restored to human form (deus ex machina through the assistance of the goddess Isis herself) and he is a changed man – changed in that he was a man originally but Isis has turned him into a boy with all his year's wisdom in tact. The tale ends with the travelers arriving at their destination and Lucius concedes that, though fantastic, he believes the story and prepares to uphold his end of the bargain. There might even be a story he can write in all this...
I can seriously run up the flight of steps to my bedroom in my home. I often race my little dog up the steps or chase my hubby. I remember in April or May of last year saying to G as I was panting at the top of the steps, “Honey I need to keep an eye on this and pay attention to when the panting stops. That will be a huge milestone.” You know…I never even noticed when it stopped.
Besides games, my other choices are TV shows, because they’re short enough to sit down and watch with dinner without feeling like you’re committing several hours of time to, and because they’re comfortably familiar. In particular, I’ve lost count of the number of times that I’ve watched Black Books and Spaced. Spaced in particular, for me, represents possibly the very best of British television. It’s clever, it’s funny, it’s well-written and above all, it’s evergreen. It’s still just as relevant today as it is now, though watching it as a slightly older person changes my perspective on it somewhat. Black Books, on the other hand, represents the other extreme of what British comedy does well – the bizarre and the uncanny. Black Books makes absolutely no sense and thus, going by past experience, it utterly confuses Americans. Admittedly I base this assumption on the fact that my brother found it really funny and my sister-in-law didn’t get it at all, so it may be a somewhat hasty conclusion. But if you want to switch your brain off and enjoy some purely comic situations, there’s few things that will beat it.

Not just losing the signal. Just booojjshhh… and nothing. I see them pulling off their headphones and working the earbuds out of their ears, stopping and staring at the devices in their hands, those so-important devices. Some might stop in the middle of the street and not notice that a taxi, just a minute ago accelerating wildly up the block, isn’t going to stop. (Brakes ought to work, the mechanism is entirely hydraulic still I think but the driver’s probably going to be pretty distracted) But you don’t hear it, because it’s not making any engine noises, and your city reflexes cue off that.

1. Big houses look clean more easily than small houses: People often think the opposite. In one sense, it’s true that a big house has more surfaces to clean, and clearly it takes longer to clean five bathrooms than it would one or two bathrooms. But in a big house, there are more places for things to spread out or be stored, while in a smaller house, more things are bound to be right in your line of vision, which seems messier. If your house is on the small side, it is even more important for you to reduce clutter in order to feel freer.

Your co workers decide to go to a bar for happy hour and inevitably you must hold your bowels a little longer, once the beers kick in it wont matter anymore, you will forget all about it. You head to you favorite watering hole and start slowly drinking. You notice the rumbles in your tummy and look around. You are safe no one will know, you let out a silent but deadly beer/grease/plain old nasty fart. No one knows, you can blame it on the table next to you or look at your co workers and make them think they did it. No harm no foul.

Jason reflects on his ex-bestfriend’s actions with his own wife. When they were fourteen and fifteen, he would park down the road and climb into her window to remain unseen from parents. He would have sex with her, and go home. In other words, what he did as a fourteen and fifteen year old with his wife, he was now doing to Melanie.
So one year after Christmas my Uncle Manuel, who lived on East 2nd street, told my Grandfather Paco about the idea of renting chairs from Pitta’s on McDonald Avenue. “Pitta’s” was and still is a funeral home off Fort Hamilton Parkway, and according to my uncle Manuel, "never does New Years Eve funerals". So why not drive over there and ask about renting some chairs for a “good price” was his suggestion to my Grandfather.

Like any parent, I always expected that some of the values that form the crux of my existence would be passed down to my child in the womb. A penchant for bad puns. A love of good food.

I just sort of expected that any child of mine would be baking his own birthday cupcakes by second grade.

The Olive Garden is to Italian food what American television is to the BBC. Having exhausted our limited creative potential long about the time of the steam engine, Americans have since learned that it's far easier and less stressing to the body humors to simply steal the popular creations of other countries, eviscerate any subtlety or nuance or subtext, add a love interest (where possible), and cover it with thick white sauce. American television is here to stuff your reality programming to bursting with padding, cymbal rolls, a voting ceremony, and poorly edited reaction shots, and just wait and see what Olive Garden has in store for your centuries-old culinary heritage.

This is all very interesting, not so say barking mad: we have a zone, after which the currency is named, which has a banking crisis that does not concern the currency at all, although the banking system, er, is trading in that currency.

The Fine Print of Self-Publishing is an exceptional book that every author looking to self-publish needs to get hold of, and it is written by someone who is a qualified attorney, someone who has invested and got involved in the publishing industry, and knows the ins and outs of marketing. Levine takes just the right approach and attitude with the book – the voice is ‘show, not just tell’—it shines through on every single page. The attention to detail in some of the services reviewed is remarkable and thorough. He is not afraid to point and say ‘look at that crap’, ‘watch out for the puddle or dog shit’ or ‘take a good look at these guys – they’re outstanding’. If you are seriously considering self-publishing, then you won’t go far wrong by ensuring you have Mark Levine’s The Fine Print of Self-Publishing as a companion before you grab your hat and coat and set out on the self-publishing path.
Lest we forget about the other end of this equation, our beloved Johns aka You, the reader. You spend your day busy, working, living your lives and usually not as reflective as the Att-whores you seek out once you’re in the comfort of your laptop and favourite sitting space. You wait, day by day for us to drop our knowledge, like a student waits for a good teacher’s word. We hold you at desperate attention for as long as it takes, patient, knowing that the next thing we post could be the one to change your life. And we don’t fail to tickle your fancy, do w? You love us. We rub you in just the right way. The conversation you share with your more simple-minded family and friends during your average urban/suburban day just doesn’t equate to the lusty dialogue of a great bloggers comedic ranting about how sad it is that “Justin Bieber and Selina Gomez just had their first fight” or how “Dating in the dark can be an interesting way to meet the man of your dreams.” We teach you about life because we live it, experience it and weight it out for you. We are the first line, the researcher, and the hunters. And after we’ve learned it all, we give you the ol’ “wax on, wax off” styled rundown of the way we see things. You admire our boldness and our ability to say out loud what you’ve been thinking for so long. We represent your secret passion to be heard, to have an opinion worth sharing, or simply being able to captivate someone with a story about burning a pot of jasmine rice. We give you the latest fashion, the coolest trends and link you to music you otherwise wouldn’t hear over your top 40 radio stations. But don’t get it twisted; we are not kings or queens. We were once Johns ourselves at a point. We just took the transaction to the next step. Instead of buying, we decided to sell. As any good Att-whore knows, pimpin ain’t easy. We lose parts of ourselves that we can’t get back. We let you in, put on our blinders and hope that you still like us when it’s all over and we do take tips, “leave them on the night table, please and thank you.”

This fortunate accident was not easily replicated. In Central and South America European explorers found dense populations ripe for plundering. They built suitably exploitative states. Britain’s North American colonies, by contrast, made poor ground for extractive institutions; indigenous populations were too dispersed to enslave. Colonial governors used market incentives to motivate early settlers in Virginia and Massachusetts. Political reforms made the grant of economic rights credible. Where pluralism took root, American industry and wealth bloomed. Where it lapsed, in southern slaveholding colonies, a long period of economic backwardness resulted. A century after the American civil war the segregated South remained poor.

However, I would consider the trigger 'excellent' and would urge people to try this kit without hesitation. The only thing I would do differently would be to also install a new trigger with pre-travel adjustment while doing this project, as it wouldn't add much to the time and effort of the work, but would definitely give an even better user/trigger interaction.

As I've noted before, many people come to the ER for fairly minor problems that should be seen by a primary-care doctor or community clinic. Unfortunately, the medical system in the US is not set up to adequately care for us all, so these people come to the emergency room.
Sometimes I think that if I prepared a little better then I wouldn’t have had a day like this, but really, its something that I couldn’t avoid. Something in the cosmos aligned in a certain way to make this day the worst day ever. :/
The song was recorded on March 2nd, 1964 at Radio Recorders in Hollywood, in a pretty productive session for the forthcoming Roustabout movie, that also spawned Little Egypt, Poison Ivy League and It's A Wonderful World.

And no, before you ask, I didn’t listen to Aerosmith or any other hard rocking band during the writing of this book. Well, I tried. But only Abba and those two other songs worked the musical magic on me for this one. That’s right -- I listened to a total of 11 songs, over and over and over again, until the book was done. (The hubs asks for your pity, which I’m sure he’s getting right now.) And, shocking absolutely no one, note how much longer the music-related-question’s answer was than any other. Yeah, that’s pretty much how I roll.

You will need about 45 minutes to get the dirty ‘rice’ ready, so prepare accordingly. Chop the cauliflower very small, or better yet, do what I did and use your food processor to shred it into rice-sized pieces. Chop the other onion and the mushrooms up into very small pieces and saute in a large skillet. I used my cast iron, and I had just enough room. You could probably also use a medium sauce pan as well. Either way, saute in the olive or coconut oil until the onions are almost caramelized.

Those who would have been saved from the inevitable collapse (like me) by going to Delta were now looking down both barrels at unemployment, furlough notice in hand and 90 days to figure out what to do. Yeah, my union was looking out for me again god bless 'em. So when I get called into the office and told in effect "You will be training your replacements" (the 747 F/Es who were bidding back to the 727 panel) I was at a loss for words. A thousand emotions flew across my mind.

Never mind whether he was born in Hawaii, born in Kenya or born on Mars – that doesn’t matter. What matters is that his father was an African nationalist revolutionary, both his father and his step-father were Muslims, his mother was an atheist and an admitted Marxist, the mentor of his teenage years Frank Marshall Davis was a known Communist Party of the USA member, his political mentor into the Chicago political scene was the unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers, his religious pastor the America-hating Reverend Wright. The apologists of Barack Hussein Obama may claim that he is not a Muslim nor a Marxist – I say if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck and is surrounded by ducks . . .

This is much needed storage as my crafting/sewing area is a total disaster. And pretty ugly looking. I can’t say it will be all pretty with this storage up but it will be less ugly.

Nope, Ross is as good as ever, yet something has changed, and not for the better. Ross relies on his audience to provide him with the raw material for his act, but in the last couple of years a worrying trend has started. People (and for people read 'wacky student types') seem to have decided it's not good enough for Ross to get his comedy from unsuspecting subjects (couples arriving late, the woman in the front rows lovely scarf etc), and they now wants to be the 'stars' of the show. We've seen a marked rise in youngsters in the front few rows sporting stupid hats, knowing full well Ross won't be able to resist the bait. But the ridiculing of someone who wants to be ridiculed somehow is no longer fun. By far the most annoying trend has started during the half-time interval, where armies of wacky ones leave all manner of shite on the stage; funny notes (I use the word ‘funny’ in the loosest possible way), crappy homemade T-shirts, pieces of popcorn, sweets, you name it – whatever it is, they all have the same thing in common, they ain't funny. But like a junkie walking out to see 30 lines of coke set up for his pleasure, Ross can't help himself, and will always make a beeline for this tat. Tonight was the worst I’ve ever seen, the stage was covered, and it took him just over 45 minutes of the second half to work his way through all the rubbish that had been left there. The truth is, it's funny for one or two people in the audience (i.e. the twats who put it there), for everyone else it’s boring. How funny is someone's bus pass going to be for an audience of 1500 people? Of course the owner of the bus pass goes home feeling like ‘Charlie Big Potatoes’, thinking (wrongly) he was the star of the show.

I have found that if I love the way Jesus called us to love one another that all these fruits follow because love is in all the fruits. I see love like a tree and from that tree the fruit produced are love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. All these fruits do so much more than help me live a good life but also give life and make life. I can recall many a times someone has brought my joy, kindness, and faithfulness. They affected my life in some way and to me that is more than just fruit. When I think of those acts I have to also think of the opposite and it stirs my heart to pray to God to cleanse me from all unrighteousness so I don’t cause any bad fruit to grow in my heart because bad fruit means a bad tree. I don’t want to impact anyone in a way that would cause them not to have peace, joy, faithfulness and joy just naming a few.
The American Dream features five cars in the driveway. Sometimes it's a highly choreographed event when someone who is in position one wants to leave the abode. Sometimes if TOTT is parked behind me I will not waste a second and take his car instead of mine. Nothing gets between me and five minutes of alone grocery shopping! His car is always cleaner - one of the perks of not carrying someone under age three on the regular - and it features great music which only adds to the allure of a short vacation trip to pick up goodies.
It may help to rank them for each event or behaviour and then within each need; give it a score out of 10. Meeting a need at a level 10 donates that it totally fulfills every aspect; having an event or a behaviour that has 3 needs being met at a level 10 donates that it is an addiction . (this is not necessarily a negative thing though!)

“Although I work hard, I love being able to serve my community.” Sellman said. “The people in all the organizations I’m involved with, all share my values and my world view and they are my friends and my family. The people and the activities fill up my life with fun, joy and a purpose I could never have achieved any other way. It doesn’t mean that I think everyone should take the same path that I have. I know most people don’t have the time. My point is this: it only takes one simple act, one click of a mouse button to start a movement. It happened to me and it can happen to you. All you need to do is give it a shot.”

The forces on the Good side were 24 warriors of Minas Tirith (8 spear and shield, 8 archers, 8 sword and shield). On the Evil side, we used 175 points of troops (since the Minas Tirith warriors added up to 200 points exactly) and thus were 10 orcs (5 archers, 3 sword and shield, 2 double-handed weapons), 2 uruk-hai berserkers, and 5 uruk-hai with pikes. This gave the Evil player some interesting tactical options.

Last December, I blogged about the Brit Writers Awards, an awards program for first-time authors, which was dogged by allegations of loose judging standards and poor communication. (Max Dunbar's blog provides a summary of some of these allegations.) I was especially worried about the BWA's Publishing Programme, which offered unpublished writers mentoring and publishing for £1,795 apiece. (Nearly a year later, I can find no mention on the BWA website of this program.)

Success comes to those that have the intestinal fortitude to go beyond what most people think is “normal”.
This production updates the action to 20th century Germany, covering the first and second world wars, with Faust caught up in the middle of it all. The number cultural references are bewildering, and I'm sure I missed loads. The opening has a landscape redolent of Caspar David Friedrich, the ne plus ultra of romantic nature worshipping teutonic heroism as a backdrop for Faust's evocation to nature. Leni Reifenstahl's film Olympia crops up too, as well as the outbreak of the first world war (in a daringly comedic pantomime), Brownshirts, communists and the rise of the Nazis, Kristallnacht, and it all ends in Auschwitz. When Faust dreams of Marguerite she appears as a sleeping Brunhilde replete with ring of fire, as the German public and Nazi officials look on (am I the only one who got this? No one else has mentioned it yet!). It's an extended commentary/critique/sending up of German culture and history, but how relevant is it really to the Faust story? What about this "konzept" really illuminates the characters or drama? I'm all for intelligent Regie theatre, but there needs to be some sort of essential and meaningful correspondance between the new situation and the original intention of the composer for it to yield any insights, or show the familiar piece in a new light. It just seemed that these two strands, Faust on the one side and German history on the other, were running along side each other with little interrelation; Mephistopheloes was the most common point of contact as far as it went, though again, it just seemed to be that he had two largely unrelated roles, with his manipulation of Faust on the one hand, and his orchestrating of Nazi activities on the other. This was an uncomfortable piece of staging partly because it didn't seem necessary - surely his dramatic role is almost exclusively to tempt Faust - and partly because Nazi Germany's crimes being the work of the devil seems a terrible abdication of blame to me. And actually the setting often detracted from the telling of the story - both because the staging was so visually confusing, with its consistently poor lighting (which didn't lead the eye at all, and unfairly left the sets looking rather ramshackle and poorly conceived) and over stuffing with ideas (no doubt paranoia that the piece is too slow dramatically on its own), and often because of the inexplicable relationship between what was going on stage to the actual action in the score. That is not to say that there weren't a lot of extremely visually arresting portions, especially those including video sequences, but it didn't quite live up to the promise of its designer/director's (over)fertile mind - it seemed to me that there was not enough editing of ideas, or thought about how it would actually look on stage. Not only did the drama suffer, but often the wonderful music was lost in the fray as well.

Now, let’s turn to Bob’s fabricated assertion that the priest-editors of an edition of Newton’s Principia had an official commission from the Church and that their words represent the ruling of “the Church”. Remember that in GWW2 (p. 41) he said that “the Catholic Church apparently had enough power to assign two Minim friars…as editors…who represented the Catholic Church” and that they were “commissioned by the Church”. And in his more recent reply to me he said, “the Church required a disclaimer to be put on Newton’s Principia” (my emphasis). To my challenge on this Bob says,

White Noise might be studded with typically postmodernist elements, consummately consumerist establishments – supermarkets, airports, motels – in which “everything is concealed in symbolism, hidden in veils of mystery and layers of cultural material,” as well as the ever-increasing presence of the media, terrifying data, over-information and the sinister duplicity of technological developments, which pose a fatal threat as well as alleviate it. Yet all these, although pertinent to the story, are also somehow merely tributary to the Gladney family’s trials and tribulations, their quotidian worries, fears, accomplishments, to “over-closeness, the heat of being”, and to the white noise of existence. And everything about the Gladneys appears authentic, captivating, from their seemingly aimless and inconsequential conversations to their choice of food, from their rational anxieties to their irrational and fractured complicity.

Instead of treating the white race as if it were neutral, Tarantino puts the black man in charge to bring the existence of the white identity into plain view. Thus, African Americans would benefit from this representation in the text, as the film places the black man in charge over the white man, and consequently shatters assumptions that Anglo Americans are superior.

I’m as pure a pantser writer as they come – the ghost of James Dean hovers over my keyboard. This is especially true when it comes to action scenes. Because I like to keep the action raw and visceral, I often throw my protagonist into predicaments from which even I’m not sure how he’s going to escape. Sometimes, I paint him into such a terrible corner, I can see him turning to me and saying, “Are you kidding me? How am I supposed to get out of this?”

Does this mean that someone’s campaign could be revived by an early win or two? Sure. But don’t hold your breath.

I knew we had crossed the line to completely wasted when she tried to walk to the bathroom and stumbled, almost falling all the way over. The gay couple at the table next to us had a better view of her fall, and they assured me that she was okay. To be fair, she was wearing heels and a skirt, but she was also definitely drunk. She’s also the type of drunk that is a fun drunk, but then gets depressed after about 5 minutes–and her depression symptoms only get worse when she gets wine drunk.

Another element that I so love about Screaming for Vengeance is that, while it's immortal in quality, the album is very easily dated to the 80s and influential on so many greats to follow from Europe and the states. The zephyr-like reverb on the instruments, the huge if simple guitar hooks built to fill an arena, this was all a blueprint for hundreds of speed, power and even hard rock acts through the decade, and I really loved this sense of grand production, something we seem to miss in this modern age of excess tracking and digitized over-polish. Not that Screaming for Vengeance isn't 'clean' or mainstream enough sounding to satisfy even the most ardent pop audience, but there's just this sense of glory through the album that I don't get out of Rhapsody or Dragonforce, despite all their advancements in speed and technicality. This is not the best of Priest, but it's very far up the scale, hot enough to burst the mercury from its thermometer.

Traverse City has the world's largest pie tin. I really wish our family had climbed in and took a picture but not only was I too stressed & pressed for time to take pictures....it was also raining when we past this photo op.
Emotion – No story is complete without this. Emotion is a very powerful force – everybody feels this, whether it’s love, hate, passion, sympathy, fun etc. Characters are no different, and they should elicit emotion with the reader through their own emotions. Your reader should feel what your characters feel.
Fabiana Romero, 37, appeared to be taking steps to keep herself and the couple’s four children safe. Those steps now are memorialized in pleas to the court to keep her estranged husband away.

And one last (and very refreshing) point to finish on. As Alex told us; “We have equipment that can measure alcohol by volume and we can test for colour and carbonation, but we can’t test for flavour. Sometimes you just have to stop and taste the beer.”
As they meet up again, in a lame jump-scare, they see another woman watching them. Her name is Anne Marie, and she actually heard Candyman committing one of his murders in a nearby apartment. She also tells Helen that she lives in fear of Candyman

"Mothers who know do less. They permit less of what will not bear good fruit eternally. They allow less media in their homes, less distraction, less activity that draws their children away from their home. Mothers who know are willing to live on less and consume less of the world’s goods in order to spend more time with their children—more time eating together, more time working together, more time reading together, more time talking, laughing, singing, and exemplifying. These mothers choose carefully and do not try to choose it all. Their goal is to prepare a rising generation of children who will take the gospel of Jesus Christ into the entire world" - Julie B Beck

One of the things I liked most about stumbling into this class were Mr. Nicholson’s prompts for observation. He may be teaching students about architecture but anyone can benefit from being aware of surroundings. Notice how the sun changes its place in the sky by hour and by season, how its light falls differently on familiar objects, how you can ascertain direction if you know where it will be on the horizon.

The sensation of the lights in my room being turned on was easy to gauge with my eyes closed.I had a vicious pumping of aching pulses raging in my head,made worse by the illumination,but i was certainly not going to wake up so early on a saturday morning.More so because i had nothing left to wake up for.A blackboard dusted clean after a long day.That was my life now- empty,plain and amazingly vast for a fresh start.But then i smelled a faint hint of my morning coffee,which i had given up on for the last few days.And my mom.I could hear the characteristic chiming of her bangles as she put my books and laptop away from my bed and placed the tray on the table beside my bed.
When the time came, all went well – apart from Hubby mistaking my “My waters have broken!” for news that the washing machine had flooded the bathroom again (that’s another story). Once the contraction pains kicked in, they came fast and furious, and Kiddo entered the world at the ungodly hour of 5.15 in the morning, just three hours after punching a hole in his amniotic sac.

I also beg the conversion of sinners, the perseverance of the Just, the Sanctification of those that are under my care, the exaltation of our Holy Mother the Church, the extirpation of heresies; the consolation of the afflicted, the prosperity of my parents and relations; the pardon of my enemies: and that you will please to shower down your blessings upon our holy Father the Pope, and all Christian Princes; especially upon our King, Queen, and Prince: and grant that England, and all misbelieving kingdoms, may be converted to the true faith. ‘Tis through the merits of all the Masses that will this day be offered throughout the whole world, that I beg the grant of these my requests. Look not on my unworthiness, but on the merits of your well-beloved Son, which sufficient to render the most unworthy most deserving of your favours.

This week I took the opportunity to speak personally and freely with a few of my employees. They have expressed personal goals of maintaining positive attitudes. Some of their solutions for maintaining a positive attitude include walking, running, or hiking during lunch hour. Some will do it alone while others will do it as a group. My goal is to establish an agreement with Department of Psychiatry at University Hospital for individual and group support by psych interns and residents. Wish us luck.

Did I mention the candy shop with the antique taffy-pulling machine in the window, working on an electric-green wodge of taffy? Oh yes, photos to follow. Foolishly I didn't bring my USB cable to hook the camera to my lappy. Or, for that matter, my wallet. I remembered the tux, though, and my appetite for giant blocks of sinfully good fudge. And a pound of saltwater taffy. And even a piece of lovely jewelry for the missus.

On the baby front, no news really. I've dropped but my doctor said she doesn't see why I can't make it to May right now. Obviously things can change at anytime but so far nothing is really happening. I haven't been checked for progress which is completely fine by me. I know that it's no real indication of when he'll arrive so I'm not at all bothered about knowing if I've dilated at all. We'll see once the real action begins.

The Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), India’s premier civilian scientific research establishment has recently disclosed in response (available here) to a RTI Application filed by me that it has spent a whopping Rs. 74.24 crores or Rs. 74,24,00,000 on securing patents for its inventions in India and foreign countries. Of the Rs. 74.24 crores, only a paltry sum of Rs. 1.78 crores was spent on securing the Indian patents. The remaining Rs. 72.46 crores was spent on securing patents around the world including jurisdictions like the U.S., Japan & the E.U. Image from here.

These guys aren’t Whedon fans, are they? Yes, the connection to Lovecraft is totally plausible, and the giant hand was indeed the cheapest thing in the movie—the ending was weak in general—but I think the plot derived more from Angel than anything else. The corporation that turned the cabin-goers’ stay into a nightmare, the need to appease the “ancient ones” with rituals, the destruction of the facility by their own monsters, even the elevators—that’s all very Wolfram and Hart. I doubt Whedon’s trying to honor Lovecraft. He’s doing his own thing, as he always has. Even when Whedon meddles with the familiar and established, it becomes something new.
It's really hard to remain positive but I hold onto the fact that I have one living baby so I know I can have living babies... we just have to make it there.

I think disappointed would be mildly understating how I felt, when I made the decision not to compete any longer. My hopes and plans had ballooned to epic proportions in my mind, for me this race which had effectively been blown out of the water would be a new moment of validation and victory. No longer so, the decision hit hard for a short while before I managed to get myself and my perceptions back into perspective.

Beginning in early childhood, Rachel displayed difficulty with basic cause and effect and experienced problems with logical thinking and seemed to have a confused thought processes. Rachel still exhibits difficulty thinking ahead and difficulty with abstract thinking and auditory processing. A marked difficulty in expressing herself well verbally is also present to this day. Eye contact is a definite problem for Rachel. Most people with ‘dissociative’ disorders do not make eye contact with those they are speaking to. To them, it is a way of maintaining control.

For many people life is not so kind, my next job today is to send my charity donations for Christmas. I have some causes I support all year round - my local hospice, the RNLI, and the air ambulance are my main ones but at Christmas I always try to give extra money where I can. The real message of Christmas isn't the gifts or the food and parties but in the true wealth of life, family, friends and the thankfulness for the bounty we've recieved all year. The joy of Christmas lies in sharing with others especially with those who may be struggling.

Frances McDormand is also good as his wife, Doris, and she adds a lot of sass and coolness to a character that is pretty unlikable, only because she is committing some infidelities; James Gandolfini is pretty much here as Big Dave and not doing much else other than just being there; and Tony Shalhoub practically comes out of nowhere and steals this flick by the end of it and made me laugh a hell of a lot more than I actually expected in a dark and sad film like this.

Mr.Buck and I are celebrating in a very low key way this year - as we tend to do every year. The thought of going out to a restaurant on this day of the year kind of makes my skin crawl, so we opt to stay in and cook a delicious dinner for ourselves and relax and enjoy eachother's company.

Yesterday I finished a prototype for a new item I’m planning to sell in my Etsy shop (what it actually is, you’re going to have to wait to find out!) It’s a great feeling, physically creating something that resembles an idea or picture in your mind. Since I began knitting, I never really liked following patterns so I naturally gravitated towards designing my own patterns.
For a long time, I have started off on my left foot. This goes for stairs, kerbs, lunges... (which is fine for even-numbered workouts, not so great for odd numbers!). Knowing this often looks really weird when you have to take a teensy step not to use the right, I bow to my desire to at least appear normal, and can use either foot. The right often results in a mental face screw-up, though, but the more I do it the less it bothers me. I'm still quite conscious of it though.
So. If I am to participate in NaBloPoMo, I can write about gifts or rules. Hmm, let me think... ;-)

As you can probably guess, I didn’t cross the finish line with a pace of 6:39, 6:41, or even 6:43. My finishing time was 1 hour 38 minutes 27 seconds, a pace of 7:30 min/mile. I would say that I was disappointed, but that’s not quite the right word. While my finishing time didn’t come close to reflecting my current fitness level, it wasn’t all bad! I fought through not knowing my overall pace the entire race and some unexpected, brutal wind! Despite those 2 factors, I never broke/ gave up mentally, which is a small victory in itself! So disappointed definitely isn’t the right word, more like frustrated.

Couple of months ago, I analysed some indicators used by the Economist to see whether the Bangladeshi economy was overheating. The verdict was that ‘it was getting hot’. An overheated economy is not only more vulnerable to an external shock, it also usually leaves the policymakers with less options to boost the economy in case of adverse shocks.

Realizing this he started his journey as an emcee at the age of 19 years in 2004.

Other emcee’s from around the way heard of him and started to vibe off his style and persona. “We use to have ciphers all the time, we used to feed off each other’s lyrics just making our own internal flame spark, priming us to spit our hardest and do lyrical and verbal damage to opponents” he said.

The beach is black and littered with the rotting remains of dead fish.

As the economy starts to shrink, the chorus of entitlement-seekers will rise to a shriek. Unfortunately many intelligent people have been recruited into roles as the highly-educated technicians who run our current bloated system. Their wages are now paid by what will soon become a rapidly shrinking tax base, or by industries which cater for discretionary purchases such as cars, Coca-Cola, corn chips or holidays in Bali over which the sword of consumer cost-cutting hangs.

The really important thing is this: the scheme of paying penance for carbon was estimated to be a $10 trillion dollar per year market that they were going to make up new from whole cloth. All of those principals, Goldman Sachs, Joel Rogers, main democratic donors like Soros, and lots of others, were set to skim "whole number percents" from that 10 Trillion dollars. You can bet large chunks of that payola was going to end up in DNC coffers by their behavior.

It is interesting therefore, to learn that the author of Waiting for Godot, considered by many to exemplify the most profoundly pessimistic vision of humanity in Western literature, and the absurd insignificance of mankind, should have identified a work by Caspar David Friedrich as the inspiration for his play. According to his biographer, James Knowlson (whose work is based on extensive interviews with Beckett himself) the writer told his friend, theatre critic Ruby Cohn, while looking at the 1824 painting Mann und Frau den Mond betrachend (Man and Woman observing the Moon) in Berlin: “this was the source of Waiting for Godot, you know.

The American population is simply devaluing these achievements by everyone obtaining them. And the worst part? People who obtain a simple 4 year degree is on average looking at a minimum of becoming $30k in debt. Now let’s say you went out of state or something? That immediately goes to $100k... and a private school like let’s say.... Gustavus Adolphus here in St.Peter, Minnesota… yeah you’re looking at $150k in debt after 4 years. I read one article that said students who attend private universities spend the next 15 years of their life paying off the debt.
This poetic art form, a component of a larger Japanese literary aesthetic is rigidly adhered to, being a construct of 5 lines consisting of two separate divides each recitable in a single breath.

I really think their Pink Collection is so Cute and I was so happy that "DD" got to Review the Little House Sorter. The House is made of soft, Organic material and filled with soft Corn fibers! Its perfect for little hands to Grasp and Explore. The House comes with Four shapes to Shake, Squeeze, Crinkle & Sort! I Love how soft the house and the shapes are, and some of the shapes make the "Crinkle" sound and texture which is great for keeping "DD" entertained and interested. She really enjoys playing with the Shape Sorter and spends a lot of time with it, putting the shapes through their holes and removing them again. But I did notice one downside to this House Sorter. The House is very soft and doesn't have much structure to it, which makes it somewhat difficult to put some of the Shapes through their holes that are on the sides, because all the items are cloth material and soft, squishy, it can be difficult, but its mostly the Triangle shape that is difficult. "DD" doesn't have any problems putting the other shapes through their holes, so for the most part, its pretty easy and not that big of a deal.

I've learned in my life to be very careful when I make promises. We've all heard the expression "Don't make promises you can't keep" - it's very wise advice. After I became a mother, it took on even more meaning because children are so literal, and their hearts get broken so easily. You can say, "I promise we'll go to the park," and then a thunderstorm hits and you can't take them - it makes perfect sense to you why the promise had to be broken, and yet to them, it's a betrayal of trust.

Are such programs (and the BWA's is not the only one) worthwhile? Not in my opinion. Literary agents are already the middlemen of the publishing world; as such, they expect to be approached by writers directly, and there's really no need for an intermediary to add another layer to the process. Plus, as tempting as it may seem to have someone else do the work for you, it's far more effective to control the process yourself, since you know your own work best and thus can best research and choose whom to approach.

The obvious effect of the attacks were all the lives lost due to the planes crashing into the towers, into the pentagon, and flight 93 crashing down into a Pennsylvania field. September 11th, 2001 was the worse act of terror I had personally witnessed. But the reign of terror unfortunately goes further than that one day. Those acts of terrorism that took 3,000 lives set in motion a war that is still waging, and we’ve lost over 4,400 troop members in Iraq alone (numbers are rising in Afghanistan, 1,752), over 33,000 US soldiers wounded and don’t forget the other countries who have lost their soldiers aiding us in this war. It goes even further than that though. We’ve lost over 2,000 civilians who were in Iraq during this war; students, journalist, vacationers with a strange idea of what a “desirable destination” is. And what about the innocent Iraqi citizens who have been caught in the cross-fire and victims of roadside bombs intended for our soldiers? 1.4 million Iraqi deaths since March 2003. Today I am mourning all of the heroes and all of the innocent lives lost.

All of the grapes are purchased, and no oak is used in the production of the wines. I like the fact that they only use indigenous Spanish grapes for their wines. They produce about 40,000 bottles each year, about 40% of them being Tempranillo, and they will be changing to screw caps in the near future. A 750ml bottle sells for about $8-$10, making these very affordable wines. But, are they also good values? Too many wines in that price range are simple wines without any character, drinkable but nothing special. So how does Tapena compare to these others?

The title's a bit of a deception, but Two on a Match wouldn't have allowed the filmmakers to use a phrase apparently then in vogue; the three women featured above have rather unequal screen time, with Bette Davis's character shoe-horned in as an after-thought to the shenanigans involving Ann Dvorak's drug-addled dissipation and Joan Blondell swooping in to pick up the pieces of Dvorak's life. Which include, not incidentally, a husband, played by Warren William in a role which must have seemed like quite an acting stretch, since on this occasion William doesn't play a complete cad. Even by the standards of the 1930s, the film squeezes an extraordinary amount of plot into an hour, with LeRoy using newspaper headlines as one neat device to mark the passage of the years, and the film takes full advantage of pre-Code leeway, with marital woes, booze, drugs and brutal gangsters (including Bogart in his hoodlum period) front and center. There's also a kidnapping sequence that must have evoked the tragic Lindbergh case, which took place earlier in 1932, for viewers of the time; as a plot device, it's rather questionable seen against the terrible outcome of the actual kidnapping.

An example of this idea is the way we talk about drugs to kids. I grew up hearing about how terrible marijuana was. Education about drugs lumped marijuana in with all the other illegal drugs, so I thought it was just as bad as cocaine or heroin. Then as I got older I found out that lots of people I knew were smoking pot, and they seemed fine. They were not junkies or addicts or criminals. That made me wonder why everyone had made such a big deal about it.
Suddenly there was a crack from the other end of the line and the woman yelled “Stop that right now” so loudly that I had to remove the receiver from my ear.
The story of Shelley's last days, a mixture of eerie foreshadowing and sheer bad luck, superlatively told. Shelley was obsessed with the sea, boats and water, and at many times in his writing he seems to be foreseeing his own death. In one of his last letters to his adored Jane, Edward's wife, he wrote hauntingly: 'How are you today and how is Williams? Tell him that I dreamed of nothing but sailing, and fishing up coral.' But was his death inevitable? Tracing the events that led up to the tragedy, Roach's elegant detective work grips.
So, I'm using the power of social media to preserve a few of these gems for posterity. And by "posterity", I mostly mean to torture them with when they are older.

Michael David Smith, Midsy to his friends and peers, two groups to which I do not belong making this an awkward opening to an article, is the lead blogger for MMAFighting.com, a part of the NBC Sports network of sports writing. MDS has written for a who’s who of top sports sites, and was the 2007 Mainstream Media Sports Blogger of the Year according to Wikipedia, which is a pretty solid source. As a general rule, MDS’ work for MMA Fighting is exactly what you would expect of a writer with that kind of body of work — factual, to the point and far from shocking. I don’t know if MDS was having a bad day or if he was actually made to spend time in New Mexico to cover the event, something that would irritate anyone, or if he just had it up to here with all these former big show fighters, but he had his sassy pants on when covering the event last night, and it ended up incredibly entertaining.

Meanwhile, I watch and I worry about all of them- wanting to help, but, not sure how I can when I am not even in the same city. I want to tell my sister that I understand, but, the truth is I can't really because my life is quite different and a whole lot easier. Who I am to tell her what to do because, if I were even in her shoes, who is to say that I would be any different.

Mystery solved. Still, I was curious about the broader question: would the same SQLSTATE warning code be returned for other aggregate functions applied to a UNION ALL with an empty-set leg (and keep in mind: the 01003 SQLSTATE is FYI information -- not an indication of an error -- and the result set returned from the query generating this code is as it should be)? And what if the aggregate function were applied to a UNION DISTINCT with an empty-set leg (and DISTINCT, of course, is the default for UNION, and is in effect unless UNION ALL is specified)? On DB2 9 and DB2 10 systems, I checked this out and found that the 01003 SQLSTATE warning code (along with the correct result) was returned when MAX, AVG, SUM, STDDEV, and VARIANCE were applied to a UNION ALL with an empty-set leg. The 01003 was not received when the COUNT, COUNT_BIG, CORRELATION, and COVARIANCE aggregate functions were applied to the UNION ALL with the empty-set leg. When any of these aggregate functions were applied to a UNION DISTINCT view, the 01003 SQLSTATE warning code was not received (I did not test this with the XMLAGG aggregate function).

A Murderous reality show is far from an original idea, as it's been seen in pop culture numerous times--from the lesser-known flick Series 7, to the Manhunt video game franchise. Luckily, then, the TV show is mostly background noise for this piece, as it is really about an obsessed viewer named Jeff who is wrestling with the idea of performing an amateur version of The Perfect Game on his wife.

Interesting side note:
This books primary social issue is the treatment of illegal immigrants. Spencer-Fleming manages to take a difficult political and social issue and make it easily understandable, both from the point of view of those who bring in the illegal immigrants and those illegal immigrants themselves. The one view point in the discussion that perhaps gets a bit short changed is that of those who have a problem with illegal immigration, but considering the treatment of social issues in previous books this is perhaps not so strange. She has a definite liberal slant to her writing, something I agree with so not a problem for me, but it might be for others.

The abnormality of the season has made me realise how far I've always fitted my writing schedules around the seasons: often as winter approaches I draw a big psychological line under the last project or set of projects and plunge in earnest into the next. But with the delay of winter this year I've been unable to escape the feeling that the season is still ahead of me, and I've had to work hard to drum up the sense of urgency that makes me work at full-tilt. Do other writers find this, I wonder?
I talked to another parent recently that said her child was out past curfew and didn't let her know where he was. "Their phone was dead," this parent said. "I should have checked their phone but I didn't think of it at the time." Then she said something that was profound for parents in our culture right now. She said she was going to be dropping him off at the prom the next weekend because she couldn't trust he was going to do what he was suppose to. I wanted to put her picture on a billboard and shout from the roof tops because this parent gets it. They understand the danger of "friendship parenting."

Great writing is still the single most powerful tool at the disposal of the modern advertiser. Whichever medium you're working in, great writing can make it work, or work harder. Unfortunately, it sometimes feels like the craft of writing is a bit downtrodden these days. Subjugated by technology, snazzy design, and a hundred red pens (beware the person who picks up their pen as they prepare to read your copy).
Every single one of those people is a person of importance. You may not have heard about them, you may not feel emotional attachment to them, you may not even have liked them if you knew them. That doesn’t make then unimportant. The soldier dying in the midst of a short, sudden battle is no more important than the little old man dying alone in his bed in his spartan apartment. The children freezing in the streets are no less important than the great leaders who are dealing with their fatal but slowly progressing disease.

"I first noticed the constant whine of helicopters at about 4 pm today. Checking the news I learned that the Occupy Oakland camp in downtown Oakland had been cleared by police in the middle of the night, and a series of afternoon protests had been called in the nearby area. With plans in place to go downtown later that night, I searched the internet with a mix of curiosity and anxiety for news of what was happening. A flurry of twitter messages at the www.occupyoakland.org site detailed a few non-violent marches snaking throughout the downtown area, all headed for the disputed encampment that had become known in recent weeks as "Oscar Grant Park". An Oakland teacher's brigade led the march (see photo.) As phrases like "unlawful assembly" "tear gas" and "bring gas masks" began popping up in OWS feeds, I knew I had to head downtown - camera in hand - to see for myself. (more photos after the jump)
Leisurely strolls in cool breezes… The Park is primarily frequented by DHA residents; regular visitors also include a fair number of serious walkers and joggers. However, most people go there to take a leisurely stroll and enjoy the fresh air, greenery and the landscaping.

In most scenarios (depending on the car), the energy balance will be positive if you turn off your car for more then 20 seconds. That means you can save gas if you turn off you car while waiting at long traffic light sequences, railroad crossings or while your better half pulls money from the ATM. Any time you can foresee that you will not be moving for more then 30s or 1minute you should turn off the engine to help your vacation budget.
This has been a very difficult time for us as we have not been able to hold her and do all the things we were able to do with our other two. I was able to hold her tonight for the first time for over an hour! (boy, what we take for granted...)

We are all praying for strength and healing for baby Brooke and that she gets to come home sooner than later.

I asked for a few stories about Mom Mom: Aunt Dee shared that growing up, there were lots of stories about the Gardner girls. My Aunt Dee remembers sharing a room with Janet and Ellen when they lived on Dellwood Avenue. She would tell them scary ghost stories and one night secretly left the room and came back in and scared them screaming with a sheet over her head. She got in trouble and her sisters were mad at her briefly, but Janet told her privately that she liked that part and wished she’d do it again. Janet was always very emotional. When Dee would not return home on time, their Mom would send Janet to find her. All the way home, Janet would worry because she would have to tell the truth about where Dee was. When they got home their mother would ask where she was and turn to Janet and ask her. She knew she could not lie. Dee would be sent to her room and Janet would run behind her crying upset that she got her into trouble.

We have many rituals that provide structures for conscious commitment. Marriage, many kinds of contracts from loans to jobs, putting things in writing, study courses and diplomas, initiations into religions, etc. If you enter into a commitment of this kind through one of these rituals, take it seriously and enter into it for yourself, not for someone else. If you find yourself needing to break the commitment for any reason (divorce, bankruptcy, foreclosure, repossession, layoff or quitting a job, dropping out of a program) do it consciously and take full responsibility. Do a ritual around the closure and the ending. If you don’t, you will leave many loose ends that continue to bleed your energy and get in the way for a new bid for power and a new commitment.
A home has the power to nurture and strengthen you and your family. Not only can you be your true self in your home - you can do anything you like there. If you want to work all day or read all day, if you want to make your backyard into a mini farm, if you want to set up a small business, if you want to teach your children about the night sky or how to plant a seed, if you want to enjoy time with visiting family and friends, if you want to reinvent yourself, there should be no one there to tell you not to. And when you really understand that your home is your safe haven, when you change your home to suit you and your family, this place you've chosen will be the making of you. Your home can have more influence over you than any other place. And the beauty of all this is that all homes have this potential power - tiny homes furnished with hand-me-downs and scrubbed-up op shop finds, rented flats and apartments with bricks holding up the shelves and smart homes with modern everything. Because it's what goes on in the home, the love given and shared, that makes the difference, not the newness of the building or the price and age of the furnishings.

The Global 7000 is the larger of the two models under development, with a 110.6 ft. length overall, and a cabin stretching nearly 60 ft. from cockpit divider to the rear pressure bulkhead, and providing a four-zone living area. It is designed to cruise 7,300 nm at Mach 0.85 with ten passengers. By contrast, the 101.6 ft.-long 8000 has a cabin measuring 50.6 ft. long and can carry eight passengers 7,900 nm at the same cruise speed.

The authors spend a few chapters condemning the meat and dairy industries. The most disturbing chapter is Chapter 6 You Are What You Eat where they go into the gory details of what apparently happens at all slaughterhouses. They reprint details and quotes from another book called Slaughterhouse by Gail Eisnitz. The quotes are apparently from slaughterhouse workers. Of course there are no names so we have no idea of knowing if the quotes are true or false. I have no doubt that there are some shifty slaughterhouses out there just like there are some farmers who mistreat their animals. But it’s important to not lump everyone together. I think it’s a case of a few bad apples spoiling the whole barrel.

I’m exploring the basic structure of things the same way I explore the skeleton in order to express the movement of a figure with one flowing line. The basic structure of most things is geometric. A byproduct of perspective drawing is intersecting planes that are not necessarily attached to the object being drawn. The shapes that appear to float in the air surrounding the object create the illusion of space and movement that I strive for. Hours vanish like cotton candy on my tongue when I’m working on these drawings.

Strictly speaking, the Massachusetts law was rejected because it was in conflict with the United States’ own sanctions against Burma (if you believe the rationale presented by the Court). The U.S. was not speaking with one voice. However, the story is more complex than this. The Massachusetts law was enacted before the federal government imposed sanctions, and further: it had teeth. The sanctions (passed in 1997) were much weaker. They were designed to suit corporate interests, particularly those of Unocal, the American oil company that has a large investment in Burma, since they (and other companies) were not required to divest their current operations, only not to engage in new projects.
Segel’s character Jeff opens the film with a short monologue on his affinity for the movie Signs and his own search for alignment in life’s seemingly random events. The hand-held shooting the directors (Jay and Mark Duplass) use is very effective. Not the entire film (headache) but enough that it evokes the feeling of a chase – even though I wasn’t sure what we were chasing. The story’s an all-in-one-day plot. There is a lot of action, but not the action-hero, high volume kind. Later I thought a lot about how much of this film’s effectiveness is related to the comedic aspects. It does have some great moments of sympathy-evoking humor, much to do with Ed Helms (The Hangover,The Office TV series) as Segel’s older, a-hole brother. But this movie goes beyond the comedy genre of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and I Love You, Man. There is a moral, and it’s not even cheesy. I found myself suspending disbelief because I wanted to believe in Jeff and his quest.

In recent years, vision science has been invigorated by the introduction of the open-access, pay-to-publish (or get-your-funding-body-to-pay-to-publish) Journal of Vision, which already ranks alongside Vision Research and IOVS in terms of impact factor and has far outstripped several other vision journals. It has forced the other vision journals to raise their game, review their policies and improve their customer service, and for that, I tip my hat. Whether its success leads to any other journal’s downfall remains to be seen, but suffice to say, this is an exciting time. The question now is how traditional scientific publishers like Elsevier and Springer will respond to this challenge of their increasingly-unjustifiable hegemony. In the meantime, I intend to use what little power I have by politely declining to review papers for Elsevier journals and thinking long and hard about to which journals I submit in the future.

Presently, humanity has expanded into space and created the Commonwealth along with a few other races including the Sakhrans. Faith has returned. She is hostile and no one knows how to defeat her, but there is a chance. A slim chance that the Commonwealth's latest Outsider class vessel captained by Aaron Foord. Outsider ships are crewed by brilliant yet deeply flawed people that hope to match and possibly defeat the almost mythological Faith. Each Outsider ship is christened with a name to remind those aboard of what they are. Charles Manson is the name of the vessel charged with stopping Faith at all costs. That name alone should give a good idea of who the people are that man the Manson. This isn't a crew of do-gooders, but they are damn good at what they do.

What about the whooshing? Wind turbines can and do produce sounds. There is the first type which is produced by moving mechanical parts (gear box, electrical generator, bearings, etc.). Modern turbines are already extremely quiet and engineers continue to make technological advances using new materials and other improvements at the design stage such as incorporating acoustic insulation for the turbine housing. Another example of innovation is the direct drive turbine. These machines have no gear box or drive train and no high speed mechanical components. The second type is aerodynamic sound, caused by the revolutions of the blades passing through the air – the whooshing. The blades of a wind turbine are designed like any other wind foil to create lift. The same principle as an aircraft wing. The wind passing over the leading edge of the blade will start the movement and thus rotation. The speed of blade rotation is in direct proportion to the speed of the wind. The sound made during the rotation is also in proportion to the wind speed and the blowing wind actually masks most sounds of blade aerodynamics, more so if the wind moves through trees, corn stalks etc. One innovation being researched is a saw tooth design at the trailing edge of the blade. The concept is to mimic a birds feather such as an owl which is known for silent flight.

For the most part, Acer has kept Ice Cream Sandwich as Google intended – avoiding extra skins or layers that might clutter the experience. But it has added the “Acer Ring” – a small yellow circle in the centre of the navigation bar. Tap it and the screen is filled with a ring graphic that gives you quick access to four shortcuts, a web search tool and scrollable volume control.

The fabric vessel started off life as a flat uninteresting piece of rust dyed felt that came to life when it was distressed with both a soldering iron and heat gun. Lutradur is intriguing in that it doesn't have a grain, doesn't fray, loves paint and can also be heat distressed making it the perfect choice to layer with the felt. Once the two fabrics were glued together there was only one seam left to cover. After trying a variety of ways to cover the untidy seam I settled on a fabric wire wrapped stick and some yarn.

So What if We Aren’t That Special…
But what to do with Nephi’s bald admission of sin? Because I believed that transgression made one unworthy of God’s acceptance and grace, I struggled with the idea of a sinful Nephi. So I fixated on his expressions of self-castigation instead. This is how godly people feel about their sins, about THEMSELVES, I reasoned.

I can't imagine parenting alone. I really can't. I find myself wanting Brandon around, especially in the evenings, because I am just plain tuckered out. This week, in addition to the paperwork that I am responsible for that won't stop piling (yay for that!) I planned a birthday party, went to a doctor appointment, braved the heat to take Brayden to see everyone in the evenings, and got up early every morning just so that I could have a shower before Brayden woke up. Plus kept up with the housework as much as I could. But it is definitely not the same routine. Things get piled, ignored, saved for later- all because I have other things occupying my time that are more important.

In some of our games one of the goals is to pick one or more small objects up. If we're using a circular board, the goal might be to pick up one object from each square and we might use a different set of objects for each person (one person gathering nickels, another pennies). This is particularly good if there are questions on the board and I want the child to answer every question.

So where are the parents while all this devil-worship happens? Working? No. Church activities? No. Parenting? Absolutely NOT. The parents are the ones funding it! They are fueling their kids' death because they don't know any better. Their kids' come to them for drug money, AND THEY WILLINGLY GIVE IT TO THEM! That's the same as selling them the drugs themselves!
Mockingjay clarifies the ending events of Catching Fire for us: namely, there was a vast allyship hidden from Peeta and Katniss, the goal of which was to yank a core group of Victors free from the Quell and begin the all-out rebellion against the Capitol. Peeta is left behind, and has become the puppet of President Snow, urging for a ceasefire in official televised interviews, earning him the label of traitor.
In a pan, heat half of the oil and add the gooseberry pulp. Let it cook on low heat and covered for 2-3 minutes. Then add the dry fried spices, jaggery and salt and let it cook for another 5-6 minutes till the water disappears and the mixture starts to get thick.

Oh, she's not perfect. She still antagonizes her sister, she's still REALLY distractible, and I still have to remind (nag) her to complete even the most basic morning routine tasks (that she REALLY should know to do, even at age seven) before we are late, damn it. But, the crux of the matter is that she is tending to stop negative behaviors before I get all pissed off and punish-y. Most of the time, these days, a warning will suffice. And that, my friends, is AWESOME.
Clifford Crane recommends people looking for unmatched drag time visibility to use Apollo Vision over the complex or their buildings. The system uses live video feeds to display events in high definition video, and refreshes at a rate of 120 femmes speed and the best thing about these high-resolution cameras designed and manufactured by Clifford Crane’s company Apollo security system is that they use full PTZ functionality. This really means that they can plan, tilt, zoom, and easily focus on any object in their field of view. Its full administrative capabilities are valued easily at local and remote stations, granting security managers the ability to observe and see the security of the area from any location.

You see, here’s the critical thing about sole parents. They are, for whatever reason, sole parents. That means that they have no other back-up, they have no one else who can step up and help in an emergency. The other parent is, by definition, not there. And most times, family members aren’t available to help either. They are busy working themselves. That means that if the state is going to require sole parents to work, then the state will need to ensure that conditions are such that sole parents can work.
That said, I have to get back to this “job” because apparently writing a blog is not considered a means to help prevent youth from spreading HIV/AIDS, STIs, or from becoming pregnant. Who knew?!

Adrian Newey’s lateral thinking in 2009 gave rise to the modern iteration of pull rod rear suspension. Although handicapping the double diffuser, the solution remained on the Red Bull cars for 2010. With double diffusers being banned for next year, other teams are looking at the concept. Lotus Technical director Mike Gascoyne has even cited the opportunity to exploit pull rod suspension as a reason for going with Red Bull Technology for the supply of their 2011 gearbox. Pull rod may well be the buzz word at the launch of many of the 2011 F1 cars.

If possible, consult a good Ayurvedic practitioner who is familiar with yogic experiences and can provide guidance if your experiences are troubling. Disturbances in the Doshas, particularly Vata or the air humor, can cause unusual experiences in the mind and nervous system that may be mistaken for spiritual experiences. These may involve nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, tremors or unusual pranic movements of an uncontrolled nature. An Ayurvedic practitioner can prescribe herbs, diet, massage and life-style changes that can help us ground our experiences better.

MK did design a corner to turn this edging inward, and I used this corner twice in a row to make the bottom point. However, I also needed to turn it outward in order to drop down and make that point. For this, I had to change a cluster of rings and a chain to make it turn. All that's left is to finish the second side, dampen and press it both to make it flat and to pre-shrink it, and sew it to the shirt.

Those who walk in Christ you will be a brighter light infused with their light.
He has a wry sense of humor, this boy. He's not talking much, but he does sign. One of his spontaneous signs is "I love you," although he can't quite get his pinky finger up yet. Yesterday Pip and I were watching him while his parents were signing papers for their new house. We were feeding him (BY MOUTH! and if you've been following this blog, you know that is another miracle!) yogurt, and some cranberry cinnamon goat's milk cheese.(BY MOUTH! Can I get a hallelujah?) Pip was signing 'I love you' to him and trying to get him to sign it back. He kept grabbing her hand and opening up her fingers, as though to say, "Stop saying that." And then he very deliberately, with a smirk on his face, opened up her fingers, pushed her hand away, turned to his food and signed "I love you" to his cream cheese.
The best thing about reading Fracture was how much it shocked me. I mean, I was quite excited for it and I thought it looked interesting but, I have to admit, from the summary I thought it was going to be a bit of an If I Stay rip off, which put me off a little. Just to confirm, Fracture is absolutely its own novel and one of the most unique books I've read in a long time. Sure, it's a little reminiscent of If I Stay, with the protagonist narrowly escaping a brush with death but that's where the comparisons end, except for the fact they're both awesome books.

A fairly good overview on the requirements to be fulfilled for consumer products can be found in the decision 6 U 157/09 of the Frankfurt Upper District Court. Here are the basics in a nutshell: Both approaches are based on the notion of "wettbewerbliche Eigenart", which could be roughly translated as "Competitive Individual Character" and is slightly different from the "individual character" required for registered designs in that the focus is put to features with the qualify for the identification of a particular trade origin of the goods. Everyday products, for which the relevant public is not used to consider the origin as relevant, do not qualify as products with "competitive individual character". Well- known or "famous" products are considered to have an increased competitive individual character.

I wasn't sure how I felt about this book - it's one of those slow reads, not a lot of action but also not a lot of internal reflection/philosophy. It's written from the viewpoint of Dell, as a 60-something, looking back on his life over half a century earlier, mostly in the voice of someone without a lot of education but eager to hide that fact with somewhat stilted language.

I think your point may have been this: African-Americans cannot be racist, in America, because they are not in a position to oppress people. This “third common element of all oppression” assumes that people must be white in order to be in a position of oppressing others. But we have only begged the question: says who? Yes, the encyclopedia entry cites a number of sources but, again, I shouldn’t have to read a book in an effort to figure out why you made that comment on my paper. I think you can surely point me to specific authority, specific pages, that would provide a solid basis for such a sweeping assertion that, so far, appears to be somewhat mistaken.
Now, I am not a natural cyclist. Not even close. I don’t have the best sense of balance and I’m scared of my fellow road users.

Bottom the weaver awakes from his “dream,” in which he was transformed into a donkey and cavorted with fairies. It all felt real to him, only when he wakes, it feels unreal and dream-like, and yet there was still something peculiar about it, something that felt distinctly real, something that no man can understand or describe. Bottom’s confusion is a poignant reminder of the psychological dilemmas awaiting us in a future where we may be able to completely immerse ourselves in our video games and entertainments. We may slowly slip away into our entertainments, pushing reality, “real life,” further and further away.

- Narrative communication involves no fewer than four basic perspectives: the author who fashions the story, the narrator who tells it, the audience or reader who receives is, and the characters who enact it. Where the narrator is practically identical with the author, as in Homer or Fielding or indeed the Bible, the discourse therefore operates with three basic relationships that constitute the point of view: between narrator and characters, narrator and reader, reader and characters.

I do not view Islam as a religion – according to my notion of religion. Islam is a political doctrine, which imposes itself by force. Any doctrine whatsoever that calls to kill those who do not believe in it is not a religion. It is a totalitarian doctrine that imposes itself by force. When I read, for example, the verse: “The adulterer and the adulteress – flog each of them with a hundred stripes, and do not let compassion for them move you” – I do not discern any spirituality in this verse. Whena certain faith manages to can strip its believers of their last grain of compassion, it strips them of their spirituality as well.

The Gemara (Sota 36b) relates that Paro’s advisors rejected the idea that a slave could become the viceroy of Egypt, because in their culture one who was born into slavery forever remained a slave. Paro replied that he discerned in Yosef an aura of majesty and nobility that proved that Yosef was sold into slavery but was not born a slave. The aura of majesty that Paro observed applied to all the brothers, who were the descendants of Avraham, Yitzchak and the children of Ya’akov. As cited above regarding Rabbi Yochanan ben Matia.

Jen snapped up this early 1960s cocktail dress at Couture Allure months ago as she knew it would be perfect to wear to her brother's wedding this past weekend. She chose to wear it without the belt and reports that she got loads of compliments. She tweeted that it is "one of the nicest cocktail dresses I've ever owned." That's vintage for you!
Cohasset, Massachusetts (population 7,542): Six months after leaving his job as Westport town administrator, Michael Coughlin has been fired from his new job as town manager of Cohasset, according to South Coast Today. Coughlin’s three years in Westport culminated in a confrontation with the elected highway surveyor, Jack Sisson. Coughlin brought in the state inspector general to investigate the Highway Department, and the resulting report was sharply critical of Sisson. The report says Sisson improperly gave $10,000 worth of paving materials — chip seal, cold patch, gravel and rock — to the Westport Excavation Co. of Tiverton. The firm does snow plowing for the town and installed a septic system at Sisson’s home, for which the contractor said he was paid between $1,400 and $1,600. The report alleges that Sisson failed to follow proper bidding procedures when buying equipment and materials and when awarding contracts for vehicle repairs. Coughlin forwarded it to Bristol County District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter, and Sisson threatened to sue Coughlin for slander. Sisson was re-elected in April 2011 with 55 percent of the vote.
L: “…there IS evidence that santa does not exist … It’s called your parents putting gifts under the tree.” By that logic, then yes, you can disprove a god. The criteria for what Santa is putting gifts under your tree, as you said. However, we know that it is in fact our parents. The criteria for what a god is, specifically the Christian god, is that he created the world in six days about six to ten thousand years ago. We KNOW that that didn’t happen. The Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and life has evolved on the Earth over the past 3.5 billion years. By that alone, God/Yahweh/Jehovah/Allah does not exist. That is just one example. So yes, that is evidence against the Abrahamic god(s).
Among the four major carriers, T-Mobile has gotten the most done: It’s set up overage alerts for voice, data and international roaming plans. Verizon has implemented them only for data and international roaming. AT&T has alerts only for data plan overages and Sprint only for international roaming.
I walked in the lead of the group, with Imp a step behind me and to my right. The two of us held flashlights, but Imp was barely paying attention to hers. She held a knife much like mine, and she dragged the point against the wall as we walked down the hallway, carving a groove into the paint. Her flashlight spent more time pointed at her feet than in front of us, leaving me the burden of lighting our way.

A fine old time was had last Wednesday night at the Hodges Figgis ‘Crime Night’, and very nice it was to meet with some familiar names, and put faces to said names. It was a tidy turn-out, too, and I sincerely hope that everyone who turned up enjoyed it as much as I did. Most enjoyable, perhaps, was the fact that the evening’s moderator, Professor Ian Campbell-Ross, declared yours truly the ‘senior member’ of a panel that included Arlene Hunt and Conor Brady, which was the first and very probably the last time I’ll be referred to as such in the presence of an ex-Irish Times editor.

It took Obama three days to find a Tele-Prompter to tell him what to say after the Christmas day attempted bombing. And then he had to come back the next day because the Tele-Prompter got it wrong. His Secretary of Homeland Security got it wrong, too, the first time.
I once watched a young actor perform. He was academically bright and took an analytical approach to his work, which was often sadly a bit wooden. This time he was just helping out a friend by playing against her for her assessment, and so not trying too hard. The result was one of the most moving pieces of theatre I've ever seen in the classroom. Freed of over-intellectualising, he produced something with real truth.

We wintered there, under the shelter of some boulders, coming out only at the crux of the day. Sometimes we found food in the cold water that never stopped lapping at the beach long enough to freeze. We were cold and starving and when I did find a fish I felt compelled to give the biggest portion of it to Sorry. She moved about very little, huddling in our cave and growing her belly. When I snuggled into her fur she welcomed me, pulling me close. If I did anything else she became agitated and bit me, or raked my face with her razor sharp nails. The soft fur on her face grew heavy with frost when the worst of the season came upon us. I came back after a day of hunting on the frigid coast and found her near to dead, colder than the sand under the foamy waves. That day I ate the most and pulled her deep into my fur, warming her until Sorry shuddered so deeply I thought the boulders around us would come to pieces.
When it comes to modern day movies and T.V. shows, I’ll admit, I’m not entirely in the loop. I find that most movies are just recreations of past movies mixed with a few different characters in a different environment. T.V. shows are often the same jokes and plots just repeated in different settings, so I don’t really pay much attention to them.
That's not all I didn't do. This year I didn't write cards. I didn't make cookies with my best friend and sing songs with family. I didn't make a giant dinner with them, eat too much, and watch "White Christmas" while everyone chatted over coffee. I didn't stare at my cousins, and note how their faces have changed/grown. I didn't go to the mountains and stare out at the white peaks, hot chocolate in-hand. These are just a few of my traditions that define the holidays. Love. Friends. Family. Memories.

When creating a villain, you need to evoke sympathy. The best villains have some reason for what they do and it has to resonate with the reader. Granted, this doesn’t happen all the time (the emperor in Star Wars has no redeeming value whatsoever), but it’s better when he does (Darth Vader).

I have been following Adrienne’s blog for several years now, and she’ll be guest-posting for me in May (you won’t want to miss it.) She is a devoted wife and mom who has experienced the joy of welcoming her children into the world, and the pain of holding one of them in her arms as he died. She shares this poignantly in her blog, with honesty, abundant love and even humor as she describes her little boy who has touched people all over the world.

Would the mayor more likely send his message to Brookfield through Ms. Taylor rather than risk sending such a politically charged message through his staff? That question has now been directly addressed by the Times. The mayor says, `nope.’ Matt Flegenheimer, the Times reporter who wrote the Bonnie and Clyde dog story, has written about Occupy Wall Street twice. One story was about how there is a flood of tourists going to visit Occupy Wall Street who are confused when they go to Wall Street itself without realizing that they, instead need to go to nearby Zucotti Park. His more recent story (one version of it with a shared byline) covers a news conference where the issue of teamwork with Ms. Taylor was raised:
A lot of the tutorials I saw used ribbon and a button - one mounted on each side of the bag in the center, to hold the book/purse closed. I liked the concept, but, as I said, my "middle" was kinda taken up by my strap. So, I just moved my button over to one side. I used a satin-covered black button and thin black leather twine that I had on hand, rather than a ribbon.

I did surprise him by finishing my novel; after what felt like 1800 re-writes and revisions. Inbetwixt that of course, I started lots of other manuscripts. I even have three more of the series going. So yes, dear, I can finish a project, but I will always have more projects than you can count in the works. My muse must have free reign. She’s like a mustang chomping at the bit. I’ll give her her head and run with it.
I mention all this, though, because an article published earlier this month in New Scientist suggested that modern humankind's primordial African ancestors might themselves have been immigrants – having walked south after a much earlier and, until now, undocumented evolutionary appearance in Europe.

Hackett was a bit of a stylistic anomaly. He is most often compared to Bix Beiderbecke, but his idol was Louis Armstrong. His specialty was Chicago-style jazz, but he was from Rhode Island. He played one of the most famous brass solos in jazz history, on "A String of Pearls" by the Glenn Miller band, but he usually played guitar in that band. And he was soloist on a long series of mood-music recordings led by a comedian, Jackie Gleason.

The protagonist is a male which is quite unusual, especially considering the vampire(-esque) genre. And I’ve flipped the usual convention on its head: instead of a minority of vampires living surreptitious lives amidst human society, in The Hunt only a small cluster of humans survive in a world of vampire-like creatures.

A barrier to social media may be a lack of education about tools available or it could be the fear that goes with learning a new platform. By creating educational resources you help calm their fears and remove that barrier. Another barrier may be that you expect employees to tweet after-hours, instead of while on the job. This may involve reassigning tasks to free up time or other things to help address those. But your business will never be social without knocking those walls down.

The question becomes how to relate to our muses without losing our minds; knowing that if we don’t write it down immediately we will lose the thought, and it will seek out another writer more ready to act on the creativity. Sometimes, the muse does not show up at an opportune moment, and “we fall into a pit of dispair” and you have to tell this entity essentially: I did my part, the best I can, now its your turn to show up and do your part.

You wanna say, “Believe your beliefs, doubt your doubts as well as doubt your beliefs and believe your doubts. You go the whole round, and that’s what we’re not taught. This is about how knowledge grows and knowledge grows by not only doubting your beliefs and believing your doubts but by (also) doubting your doubts and believing your beliefs. That involves conversation with others, inquiring, listening to a good preacher preach, going to read a good book on atheism by Dawkins… Now, not everybody has the time to do that, so in the fellowship that is one reason why we need one another so badly, so there can be other people who can do what we don’t have time to do and that division of labor really works in the church.

Whilst mama was at work Owen and dad cut two coconuts in half and drilled a small hole at each side of each half. Dad threaded string through the holes to make hangers and Owen and Cain both got to work on the filling.

As Christians “The Promise of the Father” and the Nine Empowerment Gifts are part of the Legacy we have in Christ Jesus. When we are converted, repent of our sins, and are baptized into Christ by the Holy Spirit (cf., Gal. 3:27), not only are our sins forgiven and given new Life in Christ but we also receive the Seven Sanctifying Gifts of the Spirit through which the Holy Spirit conforms us to His image (cf., Rom. 8:29) and covers us with the cloak of His Righteousness (cf., Rom. 4:5).
There are always stories behind stories...big huge ones or tiny seeds. This is a big huge story so...please bear with me. Just last week I completed answering questions for an interview I did with soul sister Rita Banerji. I had been sitting with them for a while...I wrote tons and tons and then edited and edited. So...here's the thing. I realise that if I am going to claim my story...my entire story...then I have to talk about things I don't necessarily want to. sometimes. I have to be brave enough to share what I have been through and what I have learned from them . I edited this out of the interview thinking..."oh! it's not that important...no one would be interested in that". But the truth is this right here: it's deeply deeply painful and there's a lot of shame + blame + guilt + other "yucky" emotions all tied into it that it was so much easier to edit it out. But it's big huge important. In large part because it is so difficult.
I absolutely LOVE the results!!! I know I say that a lot, but this one, oh boy! I want to make at least three more versions of it. It would look good in lime green and white as a baby quilt.

Likewise, another of my favorites Preston Sturges was similarly acclaimed and prodigious. His string of eight movies in seven years from "The Great McGinty" to "Unfaithfully Yours" is an output that, I think will never be matched. He has four movies in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies.

Gay marriage is a deal-breaker for a vast swath of American voters that includes Catholics as well as the black and Hispanic communities. Urbanites and suburbanites may say that they are okay with gay marriage, but what they tell pollsters and what they say privately among friends and family is far different. Americans may want to be tolerant, but their distaste for the gay lifestyle and incessant demands for acceptance is deeply offensive to most people.
By day I'm the meeting facilitating, number crunching, report building, work delegating, Christ-like demonstrating, corporate woman. At night, I switch roles: I remove the corporate hat and put on my crafting cape then I transform into the Paper-Crafts Chick. She's my favorite super hero! She's the one that creates all of the fun "little bitty" Positive Notes notepads and even hand-pours the "Sweet News" candles with her own designed labels. She's awesome, I'm awesome! She is ME! I truly love what I do and I love who I am (by day and by night). I believe my paper-crafting is certainly a fun outlet and it's also a sweet gift from God, because His word inspires all of my creations. I enjoy being me simply because "I am fearfully and wonderfully made...I know that full well" (Psalm 139:14).
