But, it has its place in the Bible. John the Baptist, Peter, and Jesus warned the masses about the terrors of an afterlife without saving grace attained through faith in Jesus Christ. How do we follow their lead? The book of John is filled with Jesus’ interactions with individuals, leading many of them into faith without the bullhorn approach, like the Samaritan woman at the well in Chapter 4. Both approaches are biblical so their legitimacy can’t be ignored.
Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. James 1:19 (NLT)
On the drive back home, I felt sick about what happened. I felt sick about screwing up the assignment and felt just as bad about getting testy with Margie. She was profoundly ill, frightened and nervous about having to step out of what she was comfortable with to ask a stranger for help. She'd invested some hope in me and it wasn't like she had a lot of that banked.
It is definitely not just for guacamole.
Or have you wondered why lots of us get a hankering for pumpkin pie, only in winter? Of course there is the issue that pumpkins aren't ready to eat until cool weather. But, the spices we traditionally use for pie making - cinnamon, ginger, allspice - are all warming herbs. In summer, those spices would make us feel hot and clammy. They're not spices that cause sweating (and thus cooling) like hot peppers do. So in winter, spice cake, pumpkin pie, spicy Indian chai tea (made with lots of warming spices) is what our bodies crave. It's the way our bodies adjust to the changing seasons.

The subjects on this week’s TIME cover aren’t models in pose. Jamie Lynne Grumet, photographed by Martin Schoeller with her 3-year-old son, is a mother from Los Angeles who subscribes to attachment parenting, the subject of staff writer Kate Pickert’s cover story. Attachment parenting has been on the rise over the last two decades, since the publication of The Baby Book by Dr. Bill Sears and his wife, Martha, in 1992. Its three main tenets are extended breast-feeding, co-sleeping and “baby wearing,” in which infants are physically attached to their parents by slings.
I took a 2 day trip to Amherst to visit my friend Rachael and her lovely family who all dwell comfortably in a 150 + year old farm house on 5 acres. I took a liking to the Amherst area, it is a lot like Portland in many ways. I got to visit Emily Dickinson's home and her family cemetery. If you like small museums then you should visit this one. I wish I had more time to stay in Amherst, there are a lot of antiques to buy there and it is a beautiful city with so much history. I can't wait to go back and visit Rachael again!

The end result was some semi-attractive jars, although not as perfect looking as the grocery store variety. I was concerned about stuffing too much asparagus in the pint jars, but in hindsight, the hot water bath cooked them slightly and they shrunk up a bit, so next time I will pack the jars pretty full.
I suppose I’m even more new at collage and crafts than I am always telling people, because I believed I’d made these a year ago. But it’s clear from the date stamp on the photo that I made them mid-year. I was so naïve, when the swap host told us to make 5 artist trading cards, I thought I had to go buy trading cards from a sports goods store, and change them. I also wasn’t aware that the standard ATC is vertically oriented. It’s so funny to me now! These have a lot of sentimental value for me. I remember making them, I remember not knowing what the host meant when she told us to put on the back of each card the ‘standard information’. I remember feeling really dumb about not making two sets so I could keep one. They were hard to let go. But after these, I was able to release my work into the world more readily. I have rarely made extras to keep, but I still want to get into the habit of doing so.
In the first book I loved the story of Daenerys and couldn’t wait to get to her chapters, but in A Clash of Kings I became much less interested in her. After all the excitement and importance that surrounded her before it felt like she didn’t have much of a story to tell this time. I am hopeful that this will change in the next book as she seems to have gotten a least a little more clarity and direction by the end. Similarly I found Jon’s story slightly less interesting than before. I was excited when we learned he would be going beyond the wall, but when he got there very little happened until his last chapter when his life took a drastic turn. Now I am very excited to see what happens next.

I made copies of vintage postcards on cardstock, cut them out and then stamped a postcard stamp on the backs. These were put into a small suitcase box for guests to write out either congratulatory messages or words of advice which they then pinned to a "clothesline" strung around a big tree. The line was attached to a balsa wood airplane. I was disappointed that so few people did this - I was hoping that everyone would and we could assemble them all in a little book for Dana and John.

I think we covered everyone in the family so now you have the update. It might be the last 2011 update since we're going to be very tired this year. Ha! Trying to get out of debt and stay out, and we're very determined. You don't know how tempting it is to just rush out and buy a second vehicle... But last week I paid off a credit card, and that feeling was so much more rewarding than driving around a new minivan. Or so I keep telling myself.

I have to say thank you to so many people who follow my sisters blog and who have given her so much heart felt support. I am amazed by the love and the bond that is formed in this little corner of blog land where none of us have ever even met each other, yet the compassion is palpable, and the support is almost tangible. My dad and John are healing and I know that this has a great deal to do with so many prayers that have been offered in their behalf. It is such a comfort to know that there are still so many people in the world who have faith and will pray for a stranger because they have compassion in their hearts.
The language and the knowledge of the country is something he picked up during a two-and-a-half-year stint as a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints missionary to France in the late 1960s, including six months spent in Bordeaux. During that time he and fellow Mormon missionary Steven Bang lived in an apartment at number 4, Place du Maucaillou, in the vicinity of the ever-lively Capucins market. He was stationed there as a 20-year-old from January 1968, after time spent in the northern cities of Le Havre and Brest, and ahead of a six-month stay in Paris.
After I finished the book, I knew I had to see the movie and I prepared myself to be unimpressed because it had so much to live up to. I saw the movie as soon as I could. It had been about 3 weeks since I had finished the book, so everything was fresh in my mind.

Of course, whenever there is a mention of the BNP there is one word which its enemies repeat like a mantra, and that multi-purpose, multi-application, multiple meaning, and exhaustively over-used of words is “racist”. “The BNP is a racist party!” they cry, whilst those around them nod their heads in agreement. however, does anyone actually know what they mean, for what does “racist” mean this evening, given that it was probably meant something totally different yesterday.

Ericson (2007) and Gordon (2004), argue that laws of transience have been created as part of a broader package of counter law that targets threatening populations that are affected negatively by neo-liberal practices. The cutbacks in social welfare have left large numbers of people in desperate conditions and some of these people have become permanently homeless, thus they are viewed as an imagined source of threat (Ericson 2007). The homeless and transient people are the targets of a State which is constantly scanning for imagined sources of threats (Ericson, 2007). Anything that is perceived to be a threat to domestic security, can be dealt with through the various mechanisms such as anti-social behaviour laws, laws of criminal possession, laws against transience and by private policing organizations.
For Gwen Cooper and Rhys Williams, still recovering from the recent, traumatic events that shook the world, life is about to get difficult and dangerous again. For it’s not just Homeland Security on their trail, but something else - something alien, terrifying and deadly...
"Probably the most beautiful Dales Inn in the most beautiful of settings .... babbling streams, stunning hillsides, and charming stone-built cottages framed by beautiful gardens and well established trees". The quote comes from the website of the Fountaine Inn, Linton In Craven. Whilst there might be a few too many "beautifuls" for my liking, there is no denying that it is a grand pub in the best Yorkshire traditions. It overlooks a village green and a stone bridge over a rippling stream. You almost expect Robert Hardy dressed up as the vet Siegfried Farnon to come trundling over the bridge in a 1930s Austin : it's that kind of place, all very All Creatures Great And Small.

The same neighbor had a yard sale and left her stuff out over night. The next morning a box of clothes was moving. She carefully lifted the first piece and saw it was a 'possum and almost ran through herself getting away from it. She called Maria as asked if we still had a 'possum. Maria went down and said, "Ohhhh, Herman!" and swept him up in her arms. The neighbor asked me how in the world Maria could tell one 'possum from another. She also asked Maria to watch the yard sale while she drove to town to get something. A customer came while Maria sat there with Herman in her arms. Herman bowed up and hissed at the customer and she left. Maria never told the neighbor.

Learn how to navigate the Tsukiji Market, find out where to buy Japanese knives, discover the Antenna shops (where you can regional goods from all over Japan), where to find plastic food samples, uncover a restaurant where you can make your own pancakes, and much much more. There must be hundreds of interesting recommendations within this chapter. This chapter would be extremely useful when I eventually travel to Tokyo.
So Emi did the logical thing in this situation: she memorized the entire most commonly used Latin exorcism found on the show. She also translated it, and we discovered that it definitely isn't bullshit Latin, but actually makes sense (there's lots about unclean spirits and Satan). She also translated the exorcism used in an episode of Angel (another favorite show... Are you sensing a theme here?). And with all that translating and memorizing of Latin, my very good-with-languages sister started telling me how interesting the grammar structure is, and how there isn't any punctuation as we know it. She recognizes multiple words already, and was talking about the various Latin roots of multiple English words.
The climax of the second volume is the ignominious retreat from Crete. As the public is being told of the valiant stand being made by the troops, it is total chaos. Major Hound, the picture of the modern officer, is the other end of the insane officer corps from Richie Hook -- Major Hound cannot function without order, is incapable of improvising or taking initiative in the absence of orders. Guy is with Major Hound where there is no food and chaos; he demands food from a sergeant who is dividing it among the lower troops -- the first moment of temptation in his life and he falls. The junior ranks end up taking control as the hierarchy collapses. A counter-scene features an old Greek general being retreated by his still loyal troops and Guy is the only Brit who offers him respect.
Peter answers, presumably as the spokesman for all the disciples, especially since Mark has no Matt 16:17-19 to single out Peter. He declares Jesus the Messiah, the Christ, the long-awaited special representative of God who would bring about a final visible rule of God on earth among all nations, issuing from Jerusalem and Israel, and lasting forever. This is not the obvious context of most messianic texts of the Old Testament, but the Jewish people had had several centuries to speculate on the meaning of these passages, and “Messiah” became a convenient shorthand for the eschatological and political hopes of the Jews, a person who blended soldier, prophet, and king in one supernaturally graced package.(France, Barclay)

Grimes is a witty writer, perceptive about human nature and skilled at characterization. The 12 characters who stay at the country mansion are the rich and famous of the British literary scene. The pairing of the clever, attractive Scotland Yard superintendent and the titled amateur sleuth provides much of the appeal of the novel. Jenson (1985) calls Melrose Plant “one of Grimes’ most irresistible creations, with his ‘glittering green eyes,’ deliciously dry wit and his decision to abandon his fussy family titles.”

Much is made in the news about the constant maneuvering between Mahmoud Abbas representing the Palestinian Authority with Hamas in their political and Gaza leaderships attempting to find sufficient common ground for agreement. The problem is each side insists that they retain authority over their respective areas of influence while attempting to gain inroads on the other side’s areas of control. At stake is who gains controlling leadership not only of the Palestinian Authority but also of the PLO. The latest round of dances had agreements reached between Abbas and the political leadership in Qatar before everything fell apart when the Gaza leadership of Hamas made additional demands when meeting for final signing of the agreements with Mahmoud Abbas and the other leadership from the PLO. The signing fell shattered as the two sides could not harmonize away their differences.

Without warning or sign, I realized that something was coming towards me. There was no sound. As it drew near, it looked like a train or subway vehicle, which now pulled up at my left side and came to a stop. This seemed like an obvious invitation to board, but the train was too small to enter it. I thought, though, that I could probably get on top of it and ride it the way they do rail cars in India, so I climbed up and onto the top of the second car from the front. In a twinkling, as I did so, the train changed its form – morphing into a gigantic snake. I knew it was common in Ayahuasca visions to encounter these huge Ayahuasca snakes or jaguars or other elemental animal forms. It is sometimes a challenging test, but this seemed straightforward enough. I was going to ride the Snake!

Recently I heard about Susan Hill's book, HOWARD'S END IN ON THE LANDING in which she chronicles the year she spent reading only her own books. I'm not ready to go to that extreme, but I do intend to make reading through my own TBR pile a priority for 2012. Adam's challenge specifies that you can only read books that you have owned for at least one year - so they must have been published prior to January 1, 2011. This requirement will force me to pick some books that have been languishing for far too long. Also, I only have to read 12 books - but I must specify which ones (along with 2 alternates in case something turns into a dreaded DNF). I also like the idea of signing up with Adam's challenge because he is a new-to-me blogger and it's fun to connect with new, like-minded people. I'm not discounting the possibility of signing up for other challenges that encourage me to read my own books, but this one is for sure.

What my original review couldn't tell you is how much I've continued to LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Veronica Roth's Divergent. I read this one last February, and it remained a favorite throughout the year. It definitely came close to topping my favorite-and-best list of 2011. And was by far the best YA book I read last year. There was something about Beatrice (Tris) and Tobias (Four) that stuck with me. I wanted to pick it up a half a dozen times at least to reread it, but I restrained myself. I wanted to save it up to read it close to the release date of the second book in the series, Insurgent. The truth is the moment I finished Divergent (the first and second time) I wanted, no, NEEDED, Insurgent to be right there for me to pick up. Of course, that was impossible.

10:00 a.m. GMT: Just heard two simultaneous bursts of heavy machine gun fire, coming from two directions — north, near the Pont des Martyrs, and south, near the Pont Fahd. Sporadic bursts of rifle and machine gun fire continue emanating from the north. Not sure if it’s celebratory or actual fighting, but it doesn’t sound like the shooting we heard after the coup in March, which was all firing in the air. There’s a rumor in our neighborhood that foreign troops have been sighted in the city and that the shooting is by Malian forces engaging with these foreigners. I’m highly skeptical of these rumors.

Apparently, no matter how you try not to have ideas of what your children are going to be like, they always end up surprising you (sometimes its closer to shock than surprise). Sometimes, your children turn out to be just like you in their views and ideas, and at other times, they turn out to be the complete opposite. It’s times like these that I think of my mother, and how although I sound just like her when I laugh and have inherited her smile (minus the dimples), most of the time I am a complete mutant compared to her.

But there is one stratum which is thriving better than before: the lumpenproletariat. Engaged in all kinds of informal/illegal/semi- legal trades and activities including collection of illegal levies, the overwhelming majority of them lump together to constitute the base of the ubiquitous TMC networks comparable to Bonaparte’s Society of December 10. In many places these elements are organised as “syndicates” – local cartels of order suppliers dealing with building materials, or of transport operators and so on. Even behind the midnight assault and unwarranted arrest of Prof Mahapatra of JU was the long hand of the local “syndicate”. Its leaders actually utilised the cartoon mail forwarded by the professor to punish and pressure him over some disputed bills pending with the housing complex committee (of which Prof Mahapatra is an office bearer).

Rice then developed what may strike some as unusual primary reasons to support a blanket youth curfew: to keep young potential wrongdoers safe from retaliation or stigmatization. In an emotional voice, he read a number of unarguably ugly, racially taunting or threatening comments about a surveillance video of the theft mob robberies, made on a local news web site. Councilman Rice appeared to consider these to be evidence of a serious, pervasive intent to retaliate, and that in turn to be sufficient grounds for a curfew: “We are at a defining point right now where we can make a statement and keep one of these youths, just at least one, from making the wrong decision that might put them in harm’s way.” Rice also asserted that sentiments in his district were pro-curfew.

This past week one of most anticipated beers was released - Black Tuesday. Patrick Rue, founder and head brewer of The Bruery says that it was, “created on that now infamously dark Tuesday at The Bruery, using 2,500 pounds of grain, more than double any of the usual recipes, along with several different forms of sugar, Black Tuesday has grown into a massive, flavorful imperial stout that weighs in at a robust 19.5% alcohol. Aged in bourbon barrels for over a year, this midnight black stout is full of flavor: vanilla, burnt caramel, toasted oak, licorice, prunes and sherry-like oxidation.”

6. Drop any activities that don’t bring you joy*. Are you really interested in everything you sign up for? Are your kids? Often I realize later that what sounded like a good idea at the time now just sounds like yet another commitment (especially on a day when I’d really like figure out where my living room rug is underneath all the cat hair). Try taking an inventory of your next month and see how many of those “extra” things you’re excited about. If you’re finding yourself lacking time to relax and recharge, consider dropping one or two. No one gets an award at the end of the week for having the most commitments.
Gunther shook his head. “No, that one line I’m not going to cross. Sorry, detective.”
“We will gather in the Shah Alam Stadium at 8pm on Dec 4 to send a message to (Prime Minister) Najib (Abdul Razak) and (wife) Rosmah (Mansor) that we do not want an election before Bersih’s eight demands (is fulfilled),” he said.

A dear friend of mine, Jamie, kindly gave us a voucher for the photography session with Hsu-Yin, as a present. (Many thanks, Jamie!). It was such a thoughtful and special present, to capture these precious moments with our first son Alexander, who is already almost 7 months old. My goodness the time does fly. Hsu-Yin contacted me with an idea for the photography session, to do the photos in our home and neighbourhood, as kind of "a day in the life of" style, rather than a sit-down, posed, sort of style. I really loved the idea and so we organised the date for the session.
The coolest part of my whole day and probably my whole trip to Des Moines was seeing this!! This is a kitchen that was in the store! I think this is so cool because I have always wanted to open my own boutique store that had a kitchen in it so that I could bake some samples of different recipe packets and hold baking classes in the store. It was really cool to see this in person and to know that my dream wouldn’t be silly or funny looking at all and that it would actually work really well. Be looking out for my store in the next 20 years or so :-p
This particular project blows my mind, firstly from the sheer size of it (huge!), but also because of the quirky and wonderfully creative ideas from Ghislaine Viñas Interior Design. Not to mention the obvious enthusiasm the clients had in ‘coming on board’ which can very hard to do… aaaand lets not forget the budget!

My favoritest character in Aladdin is Genie. I think I'd marry him if I could. :P Although a close follow-up would be Iago - the parrot that never shuts up :D
Too many companies make the mistake of waiting too long to do this. Are you?
Two are married -one in a year will be wed, two out of their men has a common job and one of these two should have a blogg tribute to himself, that being out of various reasons.
I can not believe it has been three an a half years since you left your earthly bounds......and how much it aches to not have your physical presence here.
Does your beau have the time (and resources) to build you a house `a la Ryan Gosling in The Notebook? Maybe not. But did he make you breakfast? With the exception of the possible plumber’s crack, fixing the sink is probably not as sexy as standing in the rain with no umbrella and a handful of roses, yelling your name. But we’re more likely to build you an Ikea bookshelf or create an iTunes playlist or do hundreds of small (at least to you) gestures that we are listening and thinking of you. Chick flicks spotlight the most grandiose of the grand gestures; maybe as a partial result, many of our real-life loving gestures go unnoticed. When a guys thoughtfulness is ignored, it’s not only heart wrenching, it also causes him to become gun-shy about making future gestures.
But, I'm losing my thread. What I was going on to say was that upon arrival this time I was met by a complaint: that I hadn't updated my FB status to say how excited I was at their impending arrival, when I had done on numerous occasions before when my friends had visited. I think it was meant as a joke with a little bit of seriousness wedged in at the back, but they didn't seem too happy when I joked right on back that I forgot, but I'd be sure to put on FB just how excited I'd be when they left. Maybe it was that big chunk of underlying truth that rendered it unfunny to them, I don't know, but hey, I was laughing.
Obama thinks it’s OK for government to risk taxpayer money on business ventures that he deems worthy of investment. But he’s outraged at the suggestion that younger Americans be allowed to have more control over the allocation of their own tax dollars.
Whaaaaaaa???? The COW???
My hole is getting deeper. I need to get out of here. I’m looking for an out. Can I put a hazy face to that name? There must be something he was in that I’ve heard about if he’s that good. Damn, my drink is too full to feign refilling. “Oh that, yeah, it’s about that guy that needs some help with some thing, yeah, anyway…”.
Now, I have never had a McRib in my life. For the uninitiated, let me explain. The McRib is a boneless rib-shaped pork patty dipped in tangy barbecue sauce with fresh onions and pickles, all on a bun. It also apparently has 500 calories — almost as many as the KFC Double Down.
I didn't take a picture of that page, which makes their suggestions seem more like a mandate than a friendly tip, so the above page will have to suffice for now. I'm sure the other page will make an appearance here sometime in the future, while this one is one of my favorites.
He came to this country with a reputation as one of the future greats. So, how much did that reputation help him when faced with the pressure and the toxic dressing room at Stamford Bridge (with apologies to Barry Manilow):
Private gun ownership is a sentiment that is very strong with me - I am an immigrant to the US; Australian born, grew up overseas in post-colonial Southeast Asia. I'd handled .22's and 12-guage pump shotguns but it wasn't until I was fifteen the first time I fired a .45 and I thought the world was coming to an end. Circumstances brought me to America, and I found my way into the Army. That was how I became an American - I'd already been on Airborne status 3 years and made sergeant before I took my Oath of Citizenship in Raleigh, North Carolina. More significant than that brief ceremony was what serving as an Infantryman in the 82d Airborne taught me about being an American. I learned to appreciate that America is about freedom - the freedoms esconced in the Bill of Rights. And of all the rights outlined in the Bill of Rights, the 2d Amendment is the most important - because it guarantees all the rest.
Why is the Fahrenheit Grill still selling hot dogs and fries and coke at green living show? That’s disappointing and totally gross. I saw people eating there even though right beside it there was awesome chef’s food!

As my trip to Ireland coming to an end, I am reflecting on what a beautiful country Ireland truly is.
Comfort doesn't have to equal boring. You can be comfortable in couture, and that's fine (awesome, in fact, and I have a jealous of you if that's the case). When we're comfortable (not ridiculous or sloppy {sorry Britney...} ) we walk taller. We feel like we look good, so we feel good, and that shows. My uniform may not be all zazzly and exciting, but if it's good enough for her...
I’ve known about Nanogen since 2008 when, at my first ever paid acting job (a guest episode of Eastenders), the make-up lady got this little blue pot out of her bag of tricks and started shaking it vigorously over my head. At the time it changed my life. I had never heard of such a product and the difference was remarkable to say the least. I have since bought several pots and use it when acting/for special occasions/ on bad hair days. It is a very good, temporary solution to a glaringly obvious scalp.
We met Andy Coupland in New Mexico (over breakfast, as it happens – he was on holiday and staying in the same hotel as us back in Taos). As we chatted over the Marmite back there he had mentioned that he did Architecture and Walking Tours of Vancouver and might we be interested (link to Andy’s tours and book here). We were interested so we got in touch once in the area and arranged to meet up. Andy (originally from England) showed us central Vancouver pretty much building by building (and gave us a great, descriptive history of the city’s early days when we were in ‘historic’ Gastown). We would highly recommend this way to see the city. A late night though for h – what with the meal out and the Seabus back. Good job all we had to do on Wednesday was go out to lovely Deep Cove again and then watch the (final) hockey final on TV…
This is why we always tell you that OU is our rival. They are the kings of the trash talk. I remember the walk of shame I endured after attending the OU/Texas game a few years back. Hundreds of crimson and cream, one tooth wonders were sitting atop their Winabagos hurling insults as we moved through the gauntlet to our car. After that, I received 2 phone calls from some Oklahomos. Man, I hate those guys! That's why it's so awesome beating them! That's rivalry baby!
All I did that day was eat and sleep. I bathed and we went for breakfast after which I took a short nap. He woke me up for a nice leisurely lunch after which I came back and slept until late in the evening. Then I accompanied him on a few errands for he is quite the man about town, an entrepreneur actually with an amazing start-up of his own. (If you want to make arrangements for a wedding, construct a house, spend a quiet weekend out of town, or just want groceries delivered to your door-step, he’s your man in Sagara). Then in the evening he asked if I’d like to accompany him to a friend’s place about 20k out of town to see jaggery being made the traditional way. Sure, I said, why not? But we must come back in time for an early dinner so I get a good night’s sleep before I leave at four tomorrow. Sure thing, said Suji.
If there are any perks to being sick, one might be getting breakfast in bed. I have trouble sleeping and then it takes me awhile to get going in the morning, but Tom is always up early - reading, working on his classes, etc. When I finally wake up, Tom comes into the bedroom to greet me with a kiss and a cup of coffee (mostly decaf). After he asks how I feel, he asks what I would like for breakfast.

Was there actually something corrupt or wrong at UDeCOTT?
It seems that the careerists at IPCC still think they can get away with flogging the dead horse of "extreme weather." More savvy alarmists, such as those in the American media, have decided that this will no longer do, and it's time to shift the terms of the debate.

News that the Westminster Government is preparing to save billions of pounds from public spending on the railways. The McNulty review (last year) recommended that running costs should be cut by one third to bring them into line with other European rail networks, may make many people wonder as to whether or not this is a case of here we go again.

So Bialetti, you can understand how, after this ordeal, you became a long-lost hope in my eyes the moment I saw you. It was my last full day in the Italian capital and I simply needed to seize the desperate opportunity. Despite your hefty price, I bought you.
The twin issues of immigration and foreign workers have perpetually hogged the headlines since last year, an indication of how it has become a “national obsession” of Singaporeans.

I made the appointment in late January and went in to see him in early February. He referred me to a clinic at the women's hospital for a simple diagnostic test.
When my daughter says, or does something embarrassing, I always joke with her by saying, "Oh, I'm so going to blog about this tonight!" She knows I don't, since she reads most of it. I got in major trouble after the Shopping With Girls post. There were promises made, yadda yadda yadda. So, I have to be nice.
I don’t know that it did. I had a writing group of people I’d met on the MA and we all worked quite closely together, workshopping each other’s work chapter by chapter as we had done the year before. It was a bit more scary though – I felt I couldn’t make a mess of the second book, as I already had the two-book deal.
Rowan turns nine months old on Thursday. He'll be almost as old as the time he grew and lived in my body. It simultaneously feels impossibly long and like he's lived with us for much longer than that. He is living proof that time is a useless accordion. I wonder how I could turn that into a Halloween costume.

Got a call on the radio, not long after the start of shift, from one of the nurses down in CTC. It's at the other end of 10 house where I work and they keep the really crazy inmates down there.
Those of my readers who followed the discussion of the tactics of magic in last autumn’s Archdruid Report will doubtless be able to think of several good reasons why this approach is problematic, but there’s another dimension to the problem. In contemporary activism, the worst case scenarios that play so large a part in the rhetoric are there to pressure people into supporting the movement. In climate change activism, certainly, that was the case.
So, they were glued, painted and then I popped pretty little dots of colors on top of the chairs. I didn't put anything on top of the table 'cause when the gifts and the cake were on it I didn't want it to look too busy. Yep..I'm Martha Gnome-rt.

It’s been stalking me for a couple of weeks already . . . that melancholy that creeps up on me every year as summer break draws to a close. This year, it’s hitting me particularly hard; it’s a year of big milestones and transitions, and that, coupled with my already fragile emotional state in the wake of the struggles our family has had over the last several months, well, let’s just say this mama is having a hard time letting her babies go.
I’ve been playing STO again for something like 13 days. And by “playing” I mean that I did the “2800″ series, which is like five or six “episodes” (quests, if you will), and one additional episode from the series I was on when I last played over a year ago. Outside of that, I’ve done only dailies and rotated my duty officer assignments around playing my other games.
Mrs Cranston’s pies are back, and I must say I felt like I tasted a little bit of Edinburgh history. Made to the original recipe, the first thing that hits you is the tempting aroma of freshly-cooked, warm pastry.

However, as always, there is much more to this than meet the eye. The $22.6 billion fund has been beset by corruption and maladministration and now the fund head has abruptly resigned, part of a management shakeup after multiple scandals severely rattled some of the biggest donors.

1910s: Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland: There’s not much else I could argue for in this decade. Gilman’s book, while clunky at times, sets up a number of interesting questions for discussion and is actually mainly in the utopian mode (a rarity for the genre during the century).

After I was deemed sufficiently awake, the transporter (sadly, not Jason Statham) wheeled us across the hospital complex to my recovery room in maternity. It shows how far I've come in my grief that it only momentarily bothered me. The last time I was in a maternity room was after delivering Caleb.
So far, our 6 kids have faired a bit better. We've had our heartaches with them, don't get me wrong. They've just been different issues without jail, attorneys, out of wedlock sex, etc.

The hearts were cut at 3/4" high. I used repositional dotto-dots on the left half of each heart to lay out the pattern and then sewed through each column of hearts. I then folded up the left side of each heart and removed the adhesive with a rub and remove eraser. I wrapped the ribbon around the top of the white layer and then adhered it to the red printed layer using 3D foam tape.

I believe that Jesus has set us free from sin and death and in doing so He has afforded us the opportunity to fully live our lives in ways we never knew were possible before. Just sluffing (sounds appropriate) through our mundane, daily routines is not acceptable. I have found myself falling into a season of laziness the last few weeks and this pause of reflection is essential in moving forward, being productive and living as I was created to live for my sake and the sake of others.
Elisha Cooper's books are an automatic "add" for the collection, and I have a feeling that I'm going to have to order a third copy once I see this book. Homer is an aging yellow Lab. As anyone who has had the benefit of knowing a Lab or two (or more), you know that while they may be very energetic pups (and have that personality long after most dogs their age have settled down), they inevitably slow down, as all dogs do once they reach their senior years. Homer doesn't need to be involved in constant activity; he's just content to doze on the porch and keep an eye on his family. I've read how it ends, and let me tell you.....awwww! Sniffle! (No, he doesn't DIE. Thank you, Elisha Cooper, for not ending the book with the sweet old doggie dying.) It's also set in the summer, so yay! Another seasonal read.
And so, every time we go shoe shopping, I let them get the shoes they want…and I never take them clothes shopping. Of course, when they dye their hair blue one day, I will remember the shoes and remind myself that it will all be okay.

Up until a few years ago I was convinced I didn't like lemon desserts and it kills me to think of all the delicious things I missed out on. I'm firmly in the lemon lover camp now, though, and these lemon bars are certainly a new favorite here. The filling is beyond delicious - the richest, most creamy lemon curd I've ever had. It's loaded with lemon flavor and neither overly tart nor sweet. The shortbread crust is both tender and crisp, a great base for the curd. I wasn't able to give away as many of the bars as I wanted, so I had to stick them in my freezer because I knew I wouldn't be able to resist the temptation. The only problem is now I feel compelled to bake other lemon bar recipes too. For research purposes, of course :)
It's been a challenging week, but thankfully I've been able to work on some cards for a couple bloggy friends who could use a little boost. :o) The one I'm sharing today is for a friend who is injured. No worries, she's been warned to stay away from my blog until the card arrives. :o) If she steals a sneak peek, it's not my fault. ;) Teehee.

The liars in the media tell us the Western Society is flawed and failing, yet it is not western society but its enemies which has brought us to where we are, our fault, if any, is our refusal to confront them or to call them on their lies.
One of the main issues is that of bacteria growth in the grooves that a knife makes on cutting boards. Wooden boards tend to be cut into more easily, so people assume and argue that bacteria grows in them faster than in plastic boards. However, interestingly, wooden cutting boards actually fare better when tested by studies. Plastic ended up staying wet longer, which means that bacteria survive on the surface longer. You more easily pass bacteria back and forth between food in this way. Wood is water absorbent and the water dries up more quickly, meaning that bacteria cannot survive there. Wood also contains natural antibiotic agents that act as cleaners on the wood board. Wooden Cutting board must not be cleaned with harsh chemicals, which means you won’t be passing sanitizing chemicals into your food, either. The delicate cutting boards designs you’ll find at Carolina Wood Designs are natural, clean, and unique.

“It is a mistake to think ‘scientific consensus,’ of its own force, will dispel cultural polarization on issues that admit scientific investigation,” said Kahan. “The same psychological dynamics that incline people to form a particular position on climate change, nuclear power and gun control also shape their perceptions of what ‘scientific consensus’ is.”

11. Purposive Future-mindedness. Great differences exist between individuals in the degree to which considerations of the future affect their present behavior. For example, Asian students are usually more happy when they are doing something they see as related to their future goals, while Caucasian students are significantly more unhappy in such circumstances. How do we learn to defer immediate gratification?

The world has grown complex for Don Hernandez. Delores, bless her heart, lets him hearken back to better times. “We Vasquez are Spanish—our women remain at home,” she tells Terrence O'Shaughnessy (Charles Emmett Mack), one of the businessmen who pays her grandpa a visit. He’s enthralled with her, as any man would be, and she loves him right back, or so the movie insists, despite little emotional give from Costello. Maybe the actress felt, as I did watching her, that Delores Vasquez has the temperament of a contemplative, not a great lover. Her rancho’s walled courtyard and prominent Christ sculpture make it feel like a medieval convent, and Delores drifts through it free of longing. You feel nothing from her; you just watch.
As you can probably tell, nearly all of these organizations are pro-chemical, pro-chemotherapy, pro-vaccine, anti-nutrition, anti-health freedom organizations that function as disease parasites on society, profiting from sickness rather than showing people how to be healthy. None of these organizations, for example, has yet to firmly promote vitamin D as a simple, low-cost, nearly-miraculous nutrient that can prevent cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, depression, gum disease, kidney disorders and many other health conditions.
Today, the situation is so similar. It will only be with those people who are the “small jar of pure oil”. Those who feel the sacred mission of the Holy Land and its Jewish place in the destiny of the world, that Israel will again please G-d, regain its senses and begin to once again put the safety and necessity of Israel’s Jews first.

With all this super hot weather I've had a chance to break out some of the fab summer dresses I brought back from the USA. This one is by Giorgio Fiorlini and I love the bright green tropical print against the hot pink piping. It makes me think I should be kicking back somewhere nursing a Long Island Iced tea. Now there's a thought...

During that speech Chirac acknowledged the racism that had existed, saying that a wrong had now been righted with Alexander Dumas enshrined alongside fellow authors Victor Hugo and Emile Zola. The honor recognized that although France has produced many great writers, none has been as widely read and known as Alexander Dumas. His stories have been translated into almost a hundred languages, and inspired more then 200 motion pictures.
So, 4 hours later, we had our colorful cookies in hand, and we tried so hard not to eat them until the next day! We served them on our final night to cousin Alexis and her husband Rob, who came to Paris to visit with us and eat lots of pain au chocolate, and our lovely hostess Jeanne. They proclaimed them some of the best ever!!

The failure to find tech-savvy talent is preventing U.S. companies from innovating their way out of their current financial doldrums. A survey by Moritz’s firm found that 57 percent of U.S. CEOs said that creating and fostering a skilled workforce should be a top government priority.
Cosmos is quite drought tolerant, and does best in dry soils. Many folks, myself included, make the mistake of overwatering their cosmos. This can kill the plant in poorly drained soils. With good drainage, overwatering merely makes the plants tall and spindly. Cosmos attracts bees and butterflies readily, as well as small birds who enjoy feeding on flowerheads gone to seed.
You love to open and close drawers and cabinets. One of your favorite things to do is to open the cabinet where we keep tupperware in the kitchen and the cabinet where we keep extra diapers and wipes in your room and take everything out. Sometimes, you’ll even put it all back away for us. You love to do that same thing with your baskets of toys. You’ll take everything out and put them all back in again.

My wife loves bitter gourd that is fried with tau cheo (preserved soya bean). You can use either preserved soya bean or the one in paste. The savoury and saltiness of preserved soya bean helps to eliminate the bitterness in the gourd. This is a tasty and healthy dish to eat with steamed rice. It is also very easy to prepare.
Unfortunately, not all scones are created equal. In fact, some scones are downright dry and flavorless or heavy and overly iced. So you can imagine the wave of disappointment I experience when the scone I've been saving stinks.

Craig Johnson sent this post to his fans and readers, so I asked if I could repost it for all and sundry to read. I'm looking forward to Longmire which starts on A&E in June, and I've just finished Craig's lastest novel, As the Crow Flies. It's terrific!

They also demand a recount on some of our cherished beliefs about our ancestors. Monogamy? Not that common. Dyadic marriage? Only one of several common models. These international scholars know their archeology, primatology, anthropology, even their art. If this book weren’t so damn enjoyable, it would be easy to resent its tour de force of world culture.

In the meantime, fix these and let me know what you think. Enjoy – and happy croquetting!

Regardless, I ended up dancing the entire night of my first milonga back in Boston, and with only one exception (which was my fault for not watching the leader dance before I accepted, considering I did not know him) - each dance was really enjoyable. I discovered that there was a whole new layer to each leader that I did not hear before. And I was able to be more interactive, also it seemed like I had oodles of time as I stepped. Remember when you were a beginner and it seemed that there was no time to do anything other than step? And even that seemed rushed? Well, now I feel almost languorous at times, as though there was all the time in the world in between beats. It really was a lovely night. I did not get to dance with everyone that I wanted to, but that is ok - I will get to dance with them soon I am sure. :o)

I had a bunch of super sparse glitter top coats and I was not a fan of how they applied, so I spent 100 years fishing out glitter and putting it all into one bottle of clear. These photos show one coat of this stuff, so you can see how much glitter is in here. Some of the smaller ones are semi-transparent (is there a name for these?), which looks really nice in real life but translated to photos as weird pastel pieces.

Long ago inventors would be criminally punished for failing to mark their products, but then the law was changed to couple the punishment (no retrospective damages)with patent law. It seems that a more severe punishment is necessary to ensure that software products continue to be marked. This proposal is that patent holders be permanently barred from enforcing patents on products not marked. Whether this proposal is limited to software patents or not is not relevant to this paper.

Being a successful writer in this day and age requires that you learn a lot about marketing - much of which is changing - in order to promote your own work. Traditional publishing models are falling by the wayside, and Web 2.0 technologies are gaining favor. Learning how to use these and other strategies will help you to promote your book on Amazon so that you can create a successful self-publishing career.
During the week I did a quick op shop hunt at one of my favourite jaunts. I found some real treasures, like this gorgeous train blanket. It's a little bit faded, but I know my two year old is not going to care when this is thrown over his bed!
They have a definite “pecking order” though and seem to respect that for the most part. Miss Abbey is the Queen, then Miss Myne is the princess and Sunny is the baby. Miss Myne has her nose bent out of shape this evening because Sunny is on a special diet of soft food until his mouth is better. Miss Myne thinks he has moved up in the chain of command is unhappy because she is not getting the same food. It does no good to remind her that she was on special food for almost 3 months when we first got her. Myne has a conveniently short memory concerning this.

Thank you to our church family. I have never known a community as caring and compassionate as The Church At South Lake. You exemplified the love of Christ to us in a more tangible way than I could have ever imagined. Within minutes – and I mean minutes! – of receiving the news that Erin was having major complications there were already people beginning to gather in the hospital waiting room praying for her. It blew me away. They stayed late into the night and fought with us through this entire ordeal. They visited and prayed and carried our burdens along side of us as the body of Christ is meant to do. We love you. You changed things. Thank you!

So at 10pm, the time I was supposed to be laying down to sleep I was instead searching for my seam-ripper. Now, I usually don't take out seams. When I'm working on a small block and make a mistake that block goes into the scrap bin and I start over. On larger projects I usually just RIP the seam. Meaning I grab both ends of the fabric and pull. I've had many a quilting friends cringe at this practice. However last nights project was just too special for either scrap-binning (uh, no!) or RIPPING apart- it is for quilt market after all.
Milan Petrović: As is the case with every other knowledge, Internet has been of tremendous help in disseminating knowledge about Slavic pagan religion. It’s fast and allows cheap Internet publishing to flourish, thus making it possible for number of publications and papers to see the light of day, which would be otherwise almost impossible. Internet also has important purpose serving as the connecting media of choice, through which Slavic (and other) pagans can learn and explore their (and others) religion and get in contact with other Slavic (and other) pagans. The wonder of Internet made possible for virtual communities to form, which in turn becomes real communities and groups of Slavic pagans. The solitary Slavic pagans, living abroad or in small towns or remote regions, where it’s hard to find another that shares similar beliefs are enabled to be in contact via Internet with other Slavic pagans, which might be even on another continent. This improves their quality of life significantly. I believe this process is common for every other pagan and neo-pagan religion.

A recent event in my life has slapped me right up side my head and reminded me that no matter how I feel, I am most certainly growing older. That crap of "You're as young as you feel" does not take into account how our bodies fall apart as we age.
I live in Ontario, Canada with hubby Pasquale and our 2 beautiful daughters Isabelle and Juliette. I've always dabbled in all things creative but started cardmaking and blogging 2 years ago. My girls are my inspiration and my favourite images are Magnolias because I see my girls reflected in each image I create with. Copics are my favourite colouring medium but I'm also learning to incorporate Prismas with the Copics. Hubby indulges and supports me in my hobby ~ ok obsession with paper and bling ~ hehehe. His only complaint is the mountains of paper and all sorts of other crafting essentials that make their way into all the rooms in the house ~ lol. I also work part-time in government which allows me the flexibility to spend more time with my growing girls and yet also have a fulfilling career. Cardmaking has become my creative outlet and working on Diana's Design Team is a DREAM come true for me. I'm over the moon happy to have this opportunity and am honoured to work with such a talented team of crafters.

Therefore, maybe that is what makes the exhibit, "Fantasmi da scacciare," To Repel Ghosts, of work by Jean Michel Basquiat at the Palazzo Ruspoli, so fascinating and provocative here. This isn't the enormous Brooklyn Museum retrospective of 2005, which presented every aspect of the Brooklyn-born artist's career in deep focus. Here, Basquiat's work is limited to about 40+ wonderfully chosen pieces, including some created in collaboration with Andy Warhol and Francesco Clemente, more than ten works being exhibited for the first time and 5 previously unpublished photographs by Michael Halsband.

Needless to say, my parents are stuck in London, in a hotel in Heathrow, and while the airport keeps pushing their no fly times out by just a few hours each time, the message is clear to everyone. This could last a while. The upper level winds are not going to change until Thursday of next week. So chances are my parents will spend some more quality in Great Britain. Granted of course, Britain is not the worst place to get stuck. I'm assuming they're doing some sightseeing... or well, I hope they do. My mom called yesterday and left a message, telling she wanted to share her "sorrow" with a third person. ;-)

Yesterday F and I took a short trail up Monte Ceva, starting from the church of Turri (Montegrotto). It was great work for my healing tendon. It made the dog happy to spend time in the outdoors. We discovered new plants that grow in these parts. The view was better than expected from the top. On a clear day, you can see to the Adriatic Sea and enjoy plenty of the Paduan plains. The only problem was how amazingly humid and hazy it was considering that we are still in April!
It's nice to see respect for private individuals in the press. Even indiiduals who are closely linked to very public figures. it makes such a nice change from the brash and intrusive reporting in the UK.

The problem is that all their solutions are good at describing love but hopeless at actually being it. The look that melts your heart, the feeling of her touch, the invisible communication of minds in synch - I guess a robot will eventually simulate these things, but it will still be reproduction of love, not the core.
Last December, I relocated to Medellín. We have now gone from being a two-person operation to a five-person team, made up of local staff, and we hope to continue growing. We are able to work closer to the organizations and poor people we support, and also have a better understanding of the lives of the clients we aim to serve.

Non-custodial parents? When you bring your kids back to their mom/dad at the end of your visitation time, please do us the small courtesy of returning all of the clothes we sent them with.

In other words, I’m getting ready for a weekend of celebrating and enjoying the company of my husband, whom I have seen very little of lately. There will likely be consumption of alcoholic beverages. There will likely be over indulgence in aforementioned cake. There will likely be making out (etc). Or maybe we’ll both just pass out by 9:30 (more likely).
A return to the beginning.
She could feel the shape of the Gateway, the length and width of the oval that had fitted so neatly between the cot and the bars. Grunting as she focussed, stretching out with her mind between those bars and into the cell, she resisted the urge to reach out a hand as well. Pevan closed her eyes, holding the image from Dagdan's Witnessing in her mind, her speech slowing as she concentrated. "Everyone be... quiet. I can... follow, but need to... think hard."
So I did 10k today - and my legs feel GREAT! - I did proper stretches before and after and they feel better today than after yesterday's 5km. I'm really excited about the rest of Janathon now.

I came across this blog post, (partially quoted below), over the weekend and, not to demean the questioner, my initial response was how confident I am with my answers to these questions.
Chuck Colson died a few weeks back on 21 April 2012, aged 80. His legacy is priceless. One of our ex prisoners who spoke at the Prison Fellowship Scotland conference/celebration on Saturday was interviewed on mic at the front. What he had to say was great but when he was asked how he felt about Prison Fellowship he broke down as he replied, "Without them I'd be dead". That spoke more powerfully than anything, especially to me because since I know him I know that he was not exaggerating.
This is a M1937 45mm anti tank gun with crew and Komsomolets tractor. All the models are from Bolt Action. The gun itself was developed in 1937 (hence the name) based on the German 37mm under a license bought from Rheinmetal, only with a larger calibre. Not that it was much more effective against armour then it´s German counterpart and was replaced in 1942 with a longer barreled version (which again ceased being effective only one year later).

Time management. Two words I must apply to my life as classes continue to spiral into insanity. My mass communications class is absolutely killer- my roommate and I spazz out every night before we go to class. It’s like clock-work. If it’s any time between 5 and 6 p.m. on a Tuesday or Thursday, Stephanie and I are running around the apartment frantically trying to study for the quiz (we have one every single class) and proof read each other’s papers. My International Studies classes have been faring a little better. They’re intensive on reading but over all the content has been pretty interesting. I love how every debate in my Human Rights class can be settled by reading the Bible. My last class, Spanish, has been fun because I genuinely desire to speak the language. Hopefully on the next missions trip I can carry on a conversation without constantly needing a translator!

Naturally my own tastes in music developed during the 1980′s. And I used to regularly spend my pocket money on vinyl singles. Even better were the 12″ ones when they came out, as they tended to have different versions of the songs on. My favourite early bands from the 80′s were Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Adam And The Ants and Tears For Fears. I was never too keen on Spandau Ballet or Wham, although I did admire George Michael’s later solo stuff. I also became a huge Michael Jackson fan too, with the arrival of his Thriller album. In the middle of this decade, A-Ha came from nowhere (well, Norway) and I liked them immediately. Around this time I also got into The Pet Shop Boys with their catchy synthesized pop. I also had my first celebrity crush at this time, Debbie Gibson! She was the same age as me and in the charts! I loved her and thought we were meant to be together. Delusions of grandeur I know!
The Qur’an and AsSunna (the legal ways of Prophet Muhammad pbuh) have clearly given (wonderful explanation for) each and every act concering Jihad. The Book has distributed its different actions and its great number of responsibilities on its special units, a most accurate distribution that excels above all the modern organizations and the military teachings. And in fact these modern organizations and military teachings are only a small portion (drop) of the military laws of the Qur’an and AsSunna.

Having never been a part of the taping for a show, it was all very exciting for me. We were cued for applause, saw Jimmy get his makeup touch-ups (Obama either had his makeup done backstage or was going for more of the natural look), and bore witness to all that goes behind putting on a show. Well worth all the waiting in line. Seniors were given preference for tickets for the show and luckily, or unluckily depending on how you look at it, I am a senior and was a selected! However, this also meant waiting in line for 2+ hours and calling my boss to tell him I would be late to work to get a ticket. When the president is visiting your school, exceptions have to be made.
Reflecting on the story he had heard, Steve suddenly realised that people get stuck in their stories. They have failed, blown it, not measured up, wasted opportunities and the only ending is a full stop, a brick wall, nowhere to go. They are controlled by the past and that blinds them to any vision for the future. Steve quotes Proverbs 29:18: ‘Where there is no vision, the people perish.’
So when I sang, I changed the word "centrifugal" to "centripetal." It was easy, because they have the same number of syllables. Which makes one ask, "Why didn't they just do it right in the first place?"

Similar Species The Florida towhee has never been known to overlap in variety, even as a vagrant. As opposed to Florida, the canyon is paler, grey rather than brown; it has a reduced longest tail and more comparison in the crimson title, giving a assigned look. The title is sometimes increased as a reduced crest. The canyon has a bigger white waist spot with a calm dark-colored area at its jct with chest, a paler neck outlined by small lines, lores the same coloring as oral cavity, and a specific buffy eye band. Audio and calls are also very unique. See the Abert’s Towhee.
This is another unique song for Pink Floyd, it’s Roger Waters interpretation of a jazz number and it’s really catchy. He’s not rated as a singer, but I just love his voice, it’s so individual and expressive. I found myself this morning humming this tune and couldn’t place it. Then I thought ah! It’s that weird song from Meddle, so I decided to do the review. I was just reading on Wikipedia, so I’m not sure how accurate it is, but apparently, unlike the rest of the album which was created organically by Waters and Gilmour. Waters wrote and recorded this himself and then Gimour added a little slide, Wright the piano solo and Mason a couple of beats. This is certainly not what you’d expect from Pink Floyd, but it’s great all the same.

“Who shut that animal in that cage? Let it out. Have you seen its face behind the bars? There's a poor animal with blood on its head and tears running down its face. Who did that to it?” Is it a bird or a horse? Its lying in the dust and its wings are broken. Who broke its wings? Who cut off its hands so that it can't shake the bars? Its pressing its snout in the glass. Who shut that animal in a glass cage? Oh, God! There's no pity in this world.”

He has a large house on 4 acres on the outside of another small village, where we have a vegetable garden and flower gardens, and large shade trees to read under and a nice fire-pit and the deer and turkey out back and birds and my lord so much big beautiful skies and peaceful days and nights where the big full moon will shine into the bedroom and the early spring ‘peeper’s’ will sing out back in the ponds all night long. And my flowers are in bloom for months on end and we have fresh home-grown veggies all summer. My two residences are within 7 miles of each other.
It will be a fun event, so those who are local should come visit us. We’ll have a fun coloring table at our booth for the kids, so there’s something there for everyone.
As I was watching the bees, I was thinking how important they are to human life. If they don’t pollinate the plants that feed our animals and feed us, we will starve. We are absolutely dependent on them. I doubt very much that the bees are aware of their importance in sustaining our lives. Their task is to live as bees. It is not their task to do all the other things we also need in order to survive.
While I like Munch’s The Scream, I’m not sure it’s worth $120 million. A convincing reproduction on Amazon recently sold for $2.57, the same one I used to own as a 20 year old college kid that prominently adorned my bedroom wall, not far from my copy of Catcher In The Rye.

Another trappist, Westmalle, have coasters reading "Heerlijk duurt het langst" - the delicious lasts longest ( a pun on the proverb "Eerlijk duurt het langst" - honesty lasts longest). As any visit to De Heeren van Liedekercke is likely to be a delicious experience, it promises well for the future of Belgium's no 1 beer café.
From creative genius Tim Burton (“Alice in Wonderland,” The Nightmare Before Christmas”) comes “Frankenweenie,” a heartwarming tale about a boy and his dog. After unexpectedly losing his beloved dog Sparky, young Victor harnesses the power of science to bring his best friend back to life—with just a few minor adjustments. He tries to hide his home-sewn creation, but when Sparky gets out, Victor’s fellow students, teachers and the entire town all learn that getting a new “leash on life” can be monstrous.

The head of the honors math program somehow talked me into staying at school the next summer for a research opportunity. My family called it "math camp." It wasn't all bad. I got assigned a problem that no one had ever figured out (most likely because no one cared to), and I actually solved it. That made me feel good, but the rest of it made me think How did I get here? Why am I spending the summer in South Bend, Indiana, when my family is home in Connecticut?

The centurion had faith that led to the healing of his servant. The father's faith led to the healing of his daughter. Friends' faith, as they lowered down the man through the roof, led to his healing. And most notably, Lazarus was risen from the dead not because of his own faith (he was dead!), but by the faith of his friends and family.
I got the opportunity today to meet Ryan Maybee of Manifesto and now the Rieger in the Rieger Hotel Grill & Exchange, formerly 1924 Main. They've done an immense amount of work brightening the place up. Gone are the red walls and wood painted black. Now the space is painted a nice shade of green which is coincidentally (or maybe not) very similar to the green walls in the dining room at la manse du Vard. Gone are the glass separators that divvied up the room leading to a much more open restaurant. The bar has been completely redone and, right now, while liquorless, has a nice little framed drawing of the bar drawn by Ryan. The stunning 90 year old original floor with original Rieger logo remains untouched.

One thing we should want to take away from the quagmire of cultural politics is that we're doomed if we look to the textual qualities of objects themselves to defeat their placement in cultural commerce. Context can make films politically radical in some sense - I'm thinking of the profligacy of a work like Dennis Hopper's The Last Movie, or the anti-colonialist "missiles" by the likes of Rene Vautier (pace Nicole Brenez), or Debord's famous Howls in Favor of Sade screening (or Isou's Venom and Eternity), or even the solid and principled liberalism of a filmmaker like Bertrand Tavernier. There are a number of ways that cultural objects are political - often these ways overlap, and can even contradict each other. And often an "activist" version of cinema - a la Michael Moore (or, let's say, the Kony 2012 folks) - presumes that a political cinema is one that causes its audience to leave the theater and act in some way. Indeed this is what Eisenstein sought when he tried to devise a cinema which could play upon the spectator's sensorium in such a way as to help foment revolution. (On this, see Jonathan Beller's terrific book The Cinematic Mode of Production, whose praises I've sung many times here over the years.) But I do admire political gestures that aren't simply the instrumentalist consequences of "effective" political filmmaking. I harbor a certain romanticized liking for big, expensive movies that fail to turn a profit - and this regardless of whether I think the film is secretly good or not. I admire the Straubs and Pedro Costa, and in his own way Pasolini, whose films' very production have often sought a political and economic order alien to the hostile, dominant paradigm: i.e., matters of payment, and of closeness to the working class, the underclass, and their environments.

I found number three to be the most daunting, teacher task orientation. This key behavior “refers to the how much classroom time the teacher devotes to teaching an academic subject” (p.10). I currently have no idea how much time to allocate for math, reading, and/or writing, before I lose my students attention. What is the magic equation that will keep them engaged and able to retain the information?
Our neighbor had police in his driveway too. He had gone out to chat with them and learned of the hit-and-run accident on the highway and the disappearance of the driver onto our property. About then, an ambulance eased past our house down to my in-law’s house. “Should I go out and talk to the firefighters?” asked my husband while secretly pondering the need for a cowboy hat, rifle, and cigar.

I try to start with some numbers. Golf has become more popular in Germany and the success of Martin Kaymer is one reason. But also two girls touched the Top 10 on the Ladies Tours. Caroline Masson and Sandra Gal had good results and showed their skills. In the rest of the world member numbers and played rounds were declining. Why? Yes, depression is one excuse but golf business was too easy over the last century. Now it shows who is vital, active and cares intensively about their green fee p(l)ayers. Service pays of – always and forever. So why do so many not care for the customer that is already at the front desk? “Have fun” is a common set phrase, but really mean it and really taking care about the customer makes the difference. You need to fight 24/7 for the good memory that everybody should take home from your course, hotel, etc.

Today is Chandler's birthday, I know it gets old hearing it, but I am in constant shock at how much older my kids are compared to what I think they should be. I just had her, what...three, four years ago? Turns out, it was fourteen years ago! At 11:01 in the morning. I was so excited, I wanted a girl very badly and even if I had a catalog and a hundred years to pick the perfect combination of parts and personality, I never could have dreamed up this girl, she's simply amazing.

We are forced to look into our own heart, face our mistakes and weaknesses and see our own need for redemption. Can Truman find his? Will he make the right choice? Is there a right decision in the midst of this jumbled up life he’s created for himself and his family? Does God really have a way out?

For thousands, perhaps millions of years, what has evolved into the Homo Sapiens (Man of Reason) have constantly been thwarted by their carnal instincts. The ones which are important for this particular study are those pertaining to reproduction. Every species on Earth has the urge to reproduce; to contribute to the gene pool of future generations. Of course, these very words and the essence of it are dictated by how humans perceive it all and, thus, could be completely wrong. But I’m willing to put a little faith into humanity by giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Matthew 12: 43-45 (KJV): “43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. 44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. 45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.”
Nicaragua was an enchanting place to spend a week and I hope to return one day soon. There is so much more to explore; the surf spots of the Pacific, volcano-boarding in the north around León, Caribbean island communities, and historical jewels of earthquake-torn Managua beg for my return! Politics has stoked the fire recently again though, bringing back the not-so-distant fears of a tumultuous past. Many feel the current president, Ortega, has bought the current congress and will have no problem in changing the laws allowing him to run again for a record third term, when many more people feel it is time for a change. Venezuela's polarizing president, Hugo Chavez, has been getting friendly as well, in his apparent quest to form a socialist alliance with as many Latin American countries as possible. The past has been difficult and I hope the future doesn't continue along that way. We didn't quit on the way to the top of Maderas; I trust the Nicaraguan people won't quit either, as tired as they may be.

I'm grateful for my grandparents, great-grandparents, and all their parents and grandparents, for if even one of them had not been around or had said "no" to life, then I wouldn't be here either.

Yesterday was my birthday, and I was so glad that I had the opportunity to ride, though as you can see from Joey's windswept mane, it was VERY breezy outside! I'm supposed to work on keeping him long and low with leg, leg, leg and building his back muscle when I ride, and my personal goal has been to not fling my upper body about at the canter with him. I can always feel it the next day in my abs and calves, so I feel like I am making some progress...he really is a good boy despite trying to convince me otherwise once.

In Court 26 of the Royal Courts of Justice in London at 10.30am tomorrow, Paddy McKillen will face his latest legal opponents – on the one hand, the Barclay brothers whose avowed intention is to take control of Paddy’s Maybourne group of hotels and on the other, NAMA which sold €800m of loans in the Maybourne hotel group to the Barclay brothers in September 2011. And unlike Paddy’s separate legal battle which concluded in Dublin’sSurpreme Court last year, Paddy is set to turn up in person and take to the witness stand, which means that the elusive property investor will at last be unmasked and we’ll have something to replace the question mark above.

We have here an account of Paul’s learning, not that which he got at the feet of Gamaliel, but that which he got at the feet of Christ. He had learnt to be content; and that was the lesson he had as much need to learn as most men, considering the hardships and sufferings with which he was exercised. He was in bonds, and imprisonments, and necessities, often; but in all he had learnt to be content, that is, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it.—I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound, Phil. 4:12.

In truth, the anti-popular violence that targets primarily the urban youth, and which is the real secret of Islamophobia, was the invention of intellectuals. And it was governments, unable to build a society of civic peace and justice, who delivered the foreigners, beginning with Arab workers and their families, as fodder for disoriented and fearful constituencies. As always, the idea, even a criminal one, comes before power, which in turn shapes the opinion that it needs. The intellectual, even a sorry one, comes before the minister, who constructs his followers.
There was an air of excitement and energy like I have never known as the people came pouring into the building.

In today’s Gospel reading, we heard about how one of the apostles, St. Thomas, at first did not believe the news that Christ had risen from the dead. But once he had seen him with his own eyes, and had the chance to touch him, to touch the wounds in his hands and side, what a change! He exclaimed, “My Lord and my God!” And we can well imagine the joy he felt; a joy that propelled him through many years of missionary proclamation, ultimately meeting a martyr’s death, in witness to his risen Lord.

I’m not that old, but I’ve dodged quite a few bullets in my days. Feeding the inherent desires of my shadow side has not been an easy task to say the least.

My favourite story about a philanthropic millionaire concerns Roy Attwater, the pot-noodle tycoon. He hired an Indian gardener to tend to the grounds of his holiday mansion in Florida, and the man kept the lawn and shrubs in prime condition. The most unpleasant aspect of his job was picking up turds deposited by the dog of an inconsiderate neighbour, who allowed it to run off the leash. Tiring of this annoyance, he set a trap involving raw meat suspended from a string attached to a carton of Madras curry power. The pooch took the bait and snorted a fair dose of the powder, causing it to scamper back home to Mummy, whimpering and sneezing in a state of some distress.

My favorite part of the trip turned out to be the unexpected 3-hour wait in the Houston airport on Monday night. With no distractions and a lot of time to kill, we played the longest, and funnest, game of War I can remember. It was perfect, just us laughing and enjoying each other's company. At one point, W.B. played a winning card and gave me a look I can only describe as "Zoolander-ish" and I laughed so hard that people turned to stare. It was great.

Henry came to speak with second years about the placements program that Modo have been running with the university product design department for the last two years. Each year, Modo have taken a minimum of two full time students to work as part of the in house design team at their studio.
As far as the story goes, yet again we have a whiny main character. The young girl was based on a girl I went to high school with and who I had recently at that stage caught up with again after many years. In high school she was always pretty needy, and so I made her a bit younger and turned her into the young girl. The bad guy is just a 2-dimensional Loki-type character. But, if you ignore the characterisations, the story itself actually reads as something unique. I think the descriptions of the magic battles work okay, though I should have chosen a better arena than roof-tops at one stage. The metaphysical stuff even reads okay. Just a shame the characters are not real interesting, and that ever-present ellipsis dominates the punctuation.
“Seriously? Tina? Why didn’t you tell me you were talking to Tina behind my back? You knew I would find this on your phone bills. You gave me the password!” I asked him incredulously.
Yes, it is a teapot shaped card! I made this for The Shabby Tearoom challenge 'Embrace the white' (you could use white or cream and one other subtle color). I decided to go with cream and a pale sage color. I had been playing around with some teacup and teapot shapes anyway, so I thought I'd go with that theme. * (My card made it into the Terrific Top 3 at The Shabby Tearoom! So delighted.) *
Hundreds of RCT Against The Cuts leaflets were distributed on the day, both to those on the demonstration and passers-by. After the rally Socialist Party Wales held a very successful public meeting with about 50 in attendance. At the meeting several council workers expressed their anger towards the trade union branch leaderships, who they say had not really gone out of their way to inform the workforce that the demonstration had taken place, one worker went on to add “I only found out about the demo today, but most of the people I work with probably still don’t know after it has happened”.
The man who eventually volunteered did so reluctantly. He admits he doesn’t know much about soccer and that he has not worked much with kids this age. The thing is…he’s perfect for them without trying. He is kind, patient…and learning.

Community Musician Dr Jane Bentley was delighted to be part of this new venture. Such was the success of this, 16 further sessions were organised which ran from January to May 2011. “Forty people came along to the ‘end of season’ party and we sang, played pass the parcel and guessed the number of songs we had sung during the year.” That number is a stupendous 121 and in the Top Ten are favourites such as “Catch a Falling Star”, “Skye Boat Song”, “Pack up Your Troubles” & “You are my Sunshine.”

While we welcome this delayed apology we also call upon World Snooker to make real efforts towards stamping out bigotry and ignorance amongst its top players because behaviour that is not acceptable in society at large should not be tacitly condoned in a sport watched by millions otherwise snookers largest growth market, China and its millions of fans, would be forgiven if it began boycotting matches involving Mark Allen.

By the summer of 1980, I was ready to try to explain to myself the chronology of our Vietnam involvement. After dismissing my morning summer school class, I spent several afternoons in my sweltering classroom (the school turned off the air conditioning at the end of the summer school day), poring over Thomas Bailey’s The American Pageant (the summer school text)and his companion book of primary sources, The American Spirit. This exercise in scholarly “sweat equity” resulted in three lectures tracing the trajectory of America’s foray into Southeast Asia. They served to bring a more objective, less anecdotal tone to my treatment of Vietnam but failed to generate much discussion or enthusiasm. Either I seemed to my students to be handing down unassailable truth, or my attempt at “objectivity” had bleached all of the human interest from the story.

Given that a few blocks away BridgePort has renovated its formerly river city pub to a haute Pearl haunt (Seattle wannabe), the Lucky Lab's move seems even more counterintuitive. So far, the gamble looks like a risky one. I've been to the Lab twice, and both times it was sparsely populated (BridgePort was packed). When no one is in the pub, it feels a little lonely--that vast space needs to have quite a few bodies to avoid feeling empty. On the other hand, it's instantly relaxing to walk into the place. It feels like home to me. The beers are the same, and once I got a pint into my hand, I was happy as a clam, despite the empty seats.

I can tell you one thing that is awesome, and that is having my couch back. Those months in the rental house without my furniture took their toll, and I will never ever take my couch for granted again. This house is so big though that we're rocking things like a folding table in the dining room and a tv tray as a nightstand in the guest room. If that's not classy I don't know what is.
After that conference, the next twenty-four hours was a whirlwind experience. Josué was transferred into my class, and it somehow became unspoken protocol that he would stay with me all day long, because I was the only person who could communicate with him and the only person with whom he felt semi-comfortable.

Today, much of what we know about the sun comes from solar space missions, begun as early as 1959 with NASA’s Pioneer series of spacecrafts. Skylab and the Space Shuttle both delivered equipment into orbit that allowed for surveillance unfiltered by our atmosphere. Former President George W. Bush famously proposed a manned mission to the sun during a late-night party in 2006, when he suggested that the danger of such an attempt could be mitigated “if we go at night.” That plan was later scuttled by budget constraints and sobriety.
Working half a kilometre away on the other side of the reserve have been the CaN volunteers whose programme is managed by British Trust for Conservation Volunteers Cymru, another partner organisation in The Grasslands Trust’s work at Carmel. They have been busy opening up a new trail around a part of the reserve that visitors have previously not had access to. This area used to consist of a mix of grassland and dry heath but once again the lack of grazing has meant that these habitats have shrunk and in this particular case bracken has been the one to take advantage. The Grasslands Trust has already begun to reduce the dominance of this plant and the five hundred meters of new trail will enable visitors to see close-up the changes to the flora that happen in this area.

Between 1920 and 1970, 900,000 Jews were expelled from Arab and other Muslim countries: from Morocco to Iran, from Turkey to Yemen, including places where they had lived for twenty centuries. The 1940s were a turning point in this tragedy; of those expelled, 600,000 settled in the new state of Israel, and 300,000 in France and Canada. Today, they and their descendants form the majority of the French Jewish community and a large part of Israel's population.
You see, if we're to see a movie about Shakespeare in love, it has to be a fantasy, it cannot be the truth, because the man that everyone has thought for four hundred years was Shakespeare the great playwright, was not a playwright. This man had very little to do with the theater but pull down a small pension for the use of his name. He has left no story worth telling, while the man who really did write the plays has a marvelous story, a story which until recently, has remained untold.

So maybe he's not that great at sport but he's darn good at being a beautiful person and for that I would pick him on my team every time!

Looking at it from a post Spike-Lee perspective, The Pawnbroker displays a white, liberal fear of portraying blacks specifically in any sort of negative light. So there are certain multi-cultural social groupings in the film that are a little bit bogus. On the other hand, there are individual depictions across all the races that are remarkably progressive for their diverse inclusion and veracity. Over all, The Pawnbroker stands today as one of the great pieces of New York neo-realism, and I use the latter category precisely to suggest that the American development in the 60s probably best represented by Lumet is coming out of certain fundamentals of the Italian development in the 40s.

Thank you! I’m thrilled you think so! I can honestly say that I never thought twice about writing from a woman’s point of view at all. I’d been sitting in a pub, reading, when an older couple came in. And although they’d both made an effort to look nice and to go out, neither seemed happy. They seemed almost annoyed with each other. That was the seed from which "Where Did He Go, You Wonder," came from. I started asking myself why they could be like that and came up with the idea that became the story. But that theme (or idea) of loss and of being angry with someone for simply being them was something I hoped people would understand and get regardless of their sex. I wrote it from the woman’s point of view because that’s what felt the most natural and because that’s where I felt the story came from. If that makes sense! Sounding convincing as a woman wasn’t anything I worried about until the story was done, and questioning whether the voice worked was part of the editing process – but it certainly wasn’t the only thing I questioned!

The Buddha said, “Do not believe anything simply because it is spoken or rumored by many …found written in your religious books. … Do not believe in traditions just because they’ve been handed down to you … but, after observation and analysis, when you find anything that agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.”

OK Wednesday is no good.
America knew that there was a World Cup and that Team USA was going to be a major contender. Why? Because it was everywhere. It was in newspapers. It was talked about on talk radio. It was on the local news and in ads on TV. America was reminded that we had won this thing before and were back in position to do so again, and national pride was being stoked!
That we live now in an economy that is not sustainable is not the fault only of a few mongers of power and heavy equipment. We all are implicated. We all, in the course of our daily economic life, consent to it, whether or not we approve of it. This is because of the increasing abstraction and unconsciousness of our connection to our economic sources in the land, the land-communities, and the land-use economies. In my region and within my memory, for example, human life has become less creaturely and more engineered, less familiar and more remote from local places, pleasures, and associations. Our knowledge, in short, has become increasingly statistical.

I can say anything I want. But I can't say it ON someone elses' personal property.

Beeld newspaper has since September 2009 been sending repeated requests for a response from the Mining Department’s spokesman Jeremy Michaels without any replies.

One of the many advantages of the two creative workbooks is their encouragement of the often neglected discipline of memorizing Scripture.

I noticed that this member was almost to what we estimate the trip to cost and I suggested she might not want to put any more money in until we know for sure what the total will be. There are no refunds with how we pay in our money and I did not want her to lose the over flow with how hard I have watched her work.

Charlene challenged the CCEE Stampers to make their own brads and buttons this week. This is what I did. For my button (on my bow), I used a clear round pebble dot and place it on cardstock. I trimmed the excess away. I then used my Japanese style anywhere punch, and punched the two 'thread' holes. For my brads, I punched small circles the size of the brads I wanted to create. I glued those cardstock dots to my card. I then added Crystal Effects to create the clear dome. I allowed lots of time for it to dry before moving. I must say that they all came out pretty well......took a little time, but much cheaper than the bought type.

Is it self-seeking to want a loving and devoted husband who thinks you’re the greatest thing since the iPhone? Definitely not. While other men may complain about their wives, it gives a man a sense of pride to know his wife is different. She’s unique--she understands him when no one else does; she looks up to him as her protector and the one who provides; her admirable character is one he can trust.
These coping strategies can work to a point. But they have their drawbacks. The person that believes everything is bad can never be happy because even if something good happens they don’t enjoy it, it just creates new fears. And the overly-confident person never learns to deal with difficulty, they just deny it. And while that can work for while, it almost never works forever. Eventually something bad enough comes along that the person can’t deny it. And they are unprepared for dealing with it.

And I am fairly sure that it hasn't always been a common mistake, although it could just be that with the internet everyone's mistakes are on show, to the irritation of pedants everywhere.
Darren Aronofsky, the director of Black Swan, made his initial splash with the much praised Pi in 1998, followed up by the vivid Requiem for a Dream (’00), the admirably grand failure that was The Fountain (’06) and then his popular comeback effort The Wrestler (’08). He has become an assured stylist, and Black Swan is swaggering with style, and yet another of Aronofsky’s patented tales of despair and self-destruction, despite the fact that it is set in the seeming delicate world of ballet.

I must admit I prefer their old way of doing squares where you had an assortment of sizes, rather than the large and one size only that they came in last time I bought a set about three months ago. The newer large squares are too big for standard size cards I like to use at Christmas.

Samuel Beckett's first play, Eleutheria, mirrors his own search for freedom, revolving around a young man's efforts to cut himself loose from his family and social obligations. His first real triumph, however, came on January 5, 1953, when Waiting for Godot premiered at the Théâtre de Babylone. In spite of some expectations to the contrary, the strange little play in which "nothing happens" became an instant success, running for four hundred performances at the Théâtre de Babylone and enjoying the critical praise of dramatists as diverse as Tennessee Williams, Jean Anouilh, Thornton Wilder, and William Saroyan who remarked, "It will make it easier for me and everyone else to write freely in the theatre." Perhaps the most famous production of Waiting for Godot, however, took place in 1957 when a company of actors from the San Francisco Actor's Workshop presented the play at the San Quentin penitentiary for an audience of over fourteen hundred convicts. Surprisingly, the production was a great success. The prisoners understood as well as Vladimir and Estragon that life means waiting, killing time and clinging to the hope that relief may be just around the corner. If not today, then perhaps tomorrow.
The other obstacle to my doing anything, though, is this baby who insists on being held 24-7. But that's getting better too. On the one hand, I can now stick him in the Moby wrap and do some chores while he sleeps for a good hour or two at a time. And on the other, he now has a few "awake and happy" times during the day -- say for a half hour or so -- when he doesn't mind being put down to kick around or sit in his bouncy chair while I get a few things done. Last night he had one of those right around my bedtime, and it was lovely -- I got the last of the dishes washed, myself in pajamas and with teeth brushed, and my "nighttime supplies" (diapers, water bottle, wipes, spare blanket, etc.) all gathered together while he sat contentedly and watched me. Then I was able to sit down on the couch with Middlemarch and nurse him to sleep before rolling into bed myself, actually feeling "unwound" for once. I could totally make a routine of this.

She slapped another woman's kid. I sat up in my chair with a start and before I could even process what just happened, the Four Mamas Gang was already on the move and halfway across the forbidden grass. Like tigresses protecting their young, I have never EVER seen French women move so fast and with such intent. In a khaki pants pack, they moved as one and were up in Slappy's face before I could even blink an eye. In mere seconds, one of the mothers already had all the boys herded back over the grass and the other three Mothers had Slappy encircled. Animals are animals. You mess with the kids, you're gonna feel Mama's TEETH.

The quick and dirty on sergers – for our purposes – is it’s a sewing machine with extra spools of thread that trims and finishes the seam allowance as it sews. It finishes by wrapping the seam allowance up with loops of thread while also stitching like a traditional sewing machine. In the photo above I’ve got the serger set up to use three spools of thread – it can use four as well. The pink X’s mark the spools that are doing the traditional stitching. That thread goes through the needles. The yellow X’s mark the ‘looper’ spools – that’s the thread that wraps around the seam allowance and gets threaded through the bottom of the machine – marked by yellow X’s. Sergers are awesome because they are fast, make a nice finished seam that’s super strong and they’re great for sewing knits. They also do a nice rolled hem (well, some of them.) I mention the rolled hem because I believe in information overload, but I did not take pictures of a real, live rolled hem (is that a collective sigh of relief I hear?)

Now take my hockey analogy and apply it to the conflicts going on in the Middle East, then apply it to the world. For years countries have taken pride in defending themselves and consistently pursue a “winning” mentality. Every time money stimulates economic growth, each country (team) gets a point. The entire world is facing off against each other on one sheet of ice. Millions of players (military), thousands of coaches (leaders), and billions of spectators (me) are involved in one enclosed arena. It’s a mess that the smartest and most influential people in the world (our “refs” and “team owners”) can’t even resolve.
Once we have the two price points in mind, we obviously launch with the introductory price. We promote it as an introductory price and don't necessarily communicate an end date as that gives us flexibility to change the end date at need. Per our launch strategy, we set the book free for 2 days. Trending shows that books following the "normal" post-free cycle seem to hit their peak rank and sales on Day 3 or Day 4 then begin a slow decay. Our intent is to capitalize and maximize. We want to shore up royalties in the face of the decline, keeping the monetary base from eroding as quickly as sales. In theory, this should mean more money earned overall for the books by the time they plateau in the week or so after the price change.

Woke up at friend A's house around 6:30, had nescafe and a nice quiet time (said friend does not wake up until the last minute). Battled snow home, called friend B. Yes, plans are still on. Drank more nescafe - the sign of real laziness - jumped in the shower and headed off to friend B's house. Watched her dig out her car, received a gift, drank espresso, left for lunch with other running friends. After lunch hung out with friends B and C around the Ankara castle area. Bought items for my table in Bozeman (come on, come all!). Separated off from friend C, went to sit a bit more with friend B. While sitting and talking, met up with more of friend B's friends. Said my good-byes (at this point it's 7 pm), went home. Home for 10 minutes when the phone rings. It's friend B. They're at a restaurant near my house. Come, come, come!!! I come. 8:30 pm and a free meal later I'm home and tired.

All this could be avoided – as The Slog has argued from the start – by broadscale, planned mutual debt forgiveness – coordinated by the G20, and accepted by the world’s banking institutions. The G20, however, is a sick joke that makes the League of Nations look like a decisive body by comparison; and the banks remain the banks: convinced that they know better, and must triumph in the end.

A March Washington Post poll showed that Democrats were more willing to change their views about a subject to make their team look good. For example, in 2006, 73 percent of Democrats said the GOP-controlled White House could lower gas prices, but that number fell by more than half to 33 percent in 2012 once a Democrat was in the White House. In contrast, the opinions of GOP supporters were more consistent. Their collective opinion shifted by only a third, according to the data. In 2006, 47 percent in believed the White House could influence gas prices. By 2012, that number had risen to 65 percent up 17 points compared to the Democrats’ 40 point shift.

For example, a board could assign the remodel project to the Architectural Controls Committee (ACC) for community discussion and recommendation. The ACC, comprised of volunteers, conducts open meetings and seeks input from owners who want to participate in the process. The ACC makes a recommendation to the board for action. Typically the ACC recommendation is determined via a majority vote of the committee…Democracy!
This is a compensated review from BlogHer and Walgreens.
Is this honesty or obfuscation? This is the greatest ambiguity at the heart of the book. Freddie's 'honesty' seems often an affectation, a way of justifying his selfishness and misanthropy while yet indulging in it, and a self-centred revelling in his own awfulness, in particular in the descriptions of his actions and physical state after the murder, and his subsequent bouts of drunkenness. This, to me, makes the elegance of his prose an elegance of decadence - an ornate covering for ugliness - and so I couldn't relish it, as Jo could, for its own sake, and for this reason, although I found the novel immensely clever, I didn't actually enjoy reading it. On the other hand, there are shards of what seem to me like real honesty, moments of self-irony, in particular in Freddie's treatment of his attitude to his mother. In the group discussion Ann said that the problem in discussing Freddie's motives was that you couldn't be sure that any of the events he related actually happened: for one thing, he'd been drunk most of the time. Yes, I said, and for another there are quite pointed and perhaps paradoxically honest moments indicating that Freddie is making the whole story up. Right at the start he makes this statement: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Don't make me laugh. On more than one occasion he wonders what to decide to call a character and at one point exclaims, For God's sake, how many of these grotesques am I expected to invent? In other words, Freddie is specifically playing with the concepts of reliable and unreliable narrators, and, as I said to the group, it seems to me that the subject of the whole novel is the fakeness of (conventional) narration, with its assumptions about 'character' and cause and effect. (Although at this, John told me later, Trevor, who was sitting next to me, gave me a very amused and dubious look.) Viewed in this light, the decadence I see in Freddie's prose usefully highlights the point: the way that 'fine writing' can be a blind for flimsiness or superficiality or even lack of moral rectitude. In this light, too, Freddie's abandonment of science seems not so much louche laziness as the result of a metaphysical crisis:

Since that time, I have given birth to three children and had too many birthdays to count, but no more flowers. My friend Glenda is also married to an engineer, and we have often shared stories about no gifts and no flowers.

In days gone by, Americans with such attitudes were classified as isolationists. But the president is no advocate of insularity, instead choosing multilateralism and expressing it in rhetoric that could have come straight from its source, Woodrow Wilson. It was Wilson, after all, and not our first community-organizer president, who insisted that "there must be, not a balance of power, but a community of power, not organized rivalries, but an organized common peace." Here is the ideology of negotiation and global governance in its fullest flower.
When you think more, you tend to get the real input in the sense of how to go about a certain issue and are able to articulate better, because your mouth is very dangerous and can turn against you because you’re talking without thinking. Emotions are the same. So always think before you want to react to a certain issue.

I would go further. The sentence is wholly inappropriate. A custodial sentence for an individual in these circumstances is a punishment for sure and, it is argued, a deterrent to anyone thinking of behaving in a similar way. Well, so would a substantial fine and community service order. The cuts which provoked the protest result from the Government being skint. What better way to dig ourselves out of deficit than to spend thousands on keeping an offender of this kind in jail for months? D'oh!

Back in April 2011, it was reported on here that NAMA was recruiting “forensic managers and analysts” to examine the finances of the Agency’s debtors, the developers. These were to be NAMA employees though it is not clear how many, if any, NAMA eventually employed. Today NAMA issued a tender for the appointment to a panel of for the provision of “Credit Verification Services” which seems to indicate NAMA is ramping up its efforts to track down assets of its developers.
Indeed, the report's summary admits it (right on page 10): "When compared to college students across the nation, Pennsylvania students are very similar. Eighty four percent (84%) of students in the nation and Pennsylvania stated they have used alcohol at least once in their life. When it comes to use of alcohol in the past thirty days, Pennsylvania students registered at seventy percent (70%) versus seventy two percent (72%) for the nation." When you consider that there has historically been a higher occurrence of student drinking in the northeastern U.S. -- again, it's right there on page 10 -- the similarity blends to almost unity.
We decided to be low-key since our entire family of four was pooped. This involved veggin' out on the couch in our jammies for much of the day. We all spent some time in Landon's room. Lately, one of Landon's favorite things to do is point to his room and say "room." Then we go into his room, he picks out a book and yells "mama sit!" or "dada sit!" while patting the floor. In which case we sit down because he will yell this until we do. But on this day I grabbed my camera because I wanted to capture the time Daddy was spending with his boys. Simple but beautiful.

He's the female in this relationship when it comes to packing. 8 pairs of shoes, tons of clothes, etc. I'm always able to shove mine and the 2 kids into one suitcase. But he did it, and good thing. We only had a 40 min layover to switch planes so we really had no choice but to carry on.

From here, Chef Pascal sent out his famous steak tartare. This could very well be the best steak tartare I have ever had. Chef Pascal takes much pride in this dish, making it from raw filet mignon. As a binder for the tartare, he uses his homemade cocktail sauce, and that adds a great element. If you didn't know however, you would never guess there was cocktail sauce in there, so don't take that the wrong way. This had some nice onion flavor as well, and was topped by a quail egg, which I poured right over the top. Again, this was amazing, served with a side of French fries, and a small watercress salad. Next time, I may be very tempted to make a meal out of this, as it was absolutely delicious. The mustard that is served on the side of this is also fab, and has a great hot spiciness to it. All in all, this dish is an absolute winner.

Jen says: I advise starting with Yeah So before moving on to Paradise. It’s quite easy to let the latter wash over you without giving it the respect it deserves; Yeah So won’t blow you away, but it’s a more instantly likable album, which then paves the way for you to appreciate Paradise’s more subtle charms.

The murder of toddler Jamie Bulger in 1993 caused devastation and outrage across the country. Murdered by two ten-year-old boys, Bulger’s murder trial started a media storm and it was during these court proceedings that it was claimed that the two defendants had viewed the film Child’s Play 3, a horror film classified as an 18. Even though the film was indirectly linked to the case, the British tabloids started a campaign to stop these films from making it onto the shelves of shops and video stores. The Sun ran the headline “For the sake of ALL our kids…BURN YOUR VIDEO NASTY.” The campaign was encouraging parents to limit the number of videos their children viewed and was also campaigning for the British film classification criteria to be reviewed. It was later revealed that neither of the ten-year-old boys had viewed Child’s Play 3, it was simply found in one of their Father’s homes but the tabloid press continued to convince readers that the young boys had killed Bulger whilst imitating some graphic scenes of the film.

The so-called "Chelsea Field Death Spa Spandex Spin" (I know, as far as made-up titles go, it needs a little work) is the stuff of snugly attired legend in my mind. The way the dingy spa lighting bounced off the white spandex pressing tightly against her robust thighs was bewitching. And I wasn't the only one who thought Chelsea was the cats pajamas, a weight lifter says to her, after she's completed her famous spandex spin, "I'm Beta, you're VHS." Which I think is a compliment. (Okay, the more I think about it, and believe me, I've thought about it, the more I think that guy was insulting Darla.) Having to deal with defective diving boards, lethal shower tiles, and videocassette-based put-downs, I'm surprised Darla stuck around as long as she did.

But I still loved him. I was so sad to end things with him. After some time, we began to see each other sporadically. We agreed that we didn’t want to be completely out of each other’s lives. I took him out for his birthday just before Christmas, and at dinner, he turned to me and said, “I know that we’re pretending here. We’re pretending that we’re still together and we’re not. What if we just kept pretending through the holidays?” I know it sounds terrible, but it sounded like a wonderful idea. I had Christmas gifts I had already bought that I wanted to give him. And, at the end of the day, I loved him. I didn’t want to miss out on the holidays with someone I loved. Also, I had started to feel better. The pain of seeing my ex had passed and I was getting more comfortable with being without him for the holidays.

It was a smallish bluegill and as I watched him wriggle in our Chock full o’ Nuts coffee can, I realized he was a living thing, just like the birds in our back yard, and our kitty that sometimes brought them home to Mommy. Daddy said the fish was big enough to be my dinner. I asked if I could just keep him in the coffee can.

Maddy almost made me puke the other day. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when all of the sudden I smelled poop. I thought she might have been sick and couldn't hold it so I ran around trying to find her mess. Nothing. Then I figured she must have been gassy. Nope. I realized she was licking her mouth. OH MY GOD!! She ate the cat's poop out of the litter box. Barf. Barf. Barf!

A lot of brides have been asking me about wedding cupcakes and mini cakes. They are the latest trend and they have been very popular in the last couple of years. In fact, I had the 3" miniature cakes at my own wedding (photo #1 above) 2 years ago! Yes, being the planner that I am, that was me checking on the little cakes right before the reception! =)

That’s just the weekly general call, which takes two hours and is held each Monday night. In a recent week, besides the general call, there were specialized InterOccupy calls for members of direct-action working groups around the country; for members of media groups; for those interested in an Occupy Wiki project; for facilitators of the calls; for anyone interested in “helping Occupy migrate into structured political activism”; for occupiers in Texas; and for those interested in helping Washington state longshoremen in a labor battle.

Some of these are things that are tried and true by me, and some are ones that others have told me. I starred the ones that are Carys tested and approved. But as with anything baby related, what works for one kid is not likely to work for yours. That's pretty much how it works, I think. You read what works for other people and it's fairly certain to not work for you. But maybe your baby isn't such a rebel and will be more complacent. Ha! That's a lie. Babies are never complacent.

Complete with deft plot development and a stellar cast of characters, Insurgent will stay in my mind for a long, long time.
APEX was founded in 1992 and today serves more than 200 youth from almost 50 public schools, and provides over 6,000 hours of volunteer service a year within New York City’s five boroughs. The youth can participate in a variety of after-school programs that build academic skills to help them overcome achievement gaps, engage them in a larger community, and instill a lifelong commitment to volunteerism and service. These programs address a population that is often assumed to be well positioned for success. However, one in four Asian American youths live in poverty, one out of three do not graduate high school on time or graduate at all, and 65 percent in high-need areas are not college or career-ready upon graduation. Despite these statistics, only one percent of New York City’s social service budget and foundation grants to New York charities go toward organizations focused on Asian American communities. APEX’s programs fill the void of the underserved in this community and young people who complete its programs have a 99% college attendance rate. After 20 years, APEX’s youth alumni number in the thousands..
Diet at night. According to Nancy Clark, MS, RD, CSSD, author of Food Guide for Marathoners: Tips for Everyday Champions, “Fuel by day and eat less at night.” This way you’ll have the energy they need to run and refuel and eating more during the day will curb your nighttime appetite. Going to bed with a mild hunger means you likely will be losing weight at night, when you are sleeping; this is preferable to losing weight when you are trying to train.

Halong City, while no beauty, still enjoys a fantastic view across its eponymous bay, and is not without charm. As the centrepiece for the Victory Day celebrations, the beach and town were teeming with Vietnamese middle-class families in festive mood. Hotels were again charging a premium, with even the pokiest dirtiest rooms going for $50. After a lot of searching and a bit of haggling we settled on $20 (a bargain at just twice the normal rate) and hit the beach in time for sunset. The beer drinking, ice cream slurping and shellfish shucking was in full flow as was the souvenir buying and mobile phone-camera snapping (the Vietnamese certainly embrace capitalism when celebrating victory over its greatest proponents) and we got stuck in. After a hilariously disappointing clam soup (I was thinking chowder, the chef was thinking a thimbleful of pond water complete with a couple of snails) we toured the pop-up food stalls until we could barely move, all the while enjoying the buzz and chatter of the street party, and the lack of the backpacker pitched banana pancakes/happy hour options. What fickle folk we are…

Now, remind me of something, this isn’t the same government that weep, wail and gnash its teeth when it was in Opposition over Manning spying on the population? Help me out here folks? Is it do as I say, but not as I do with this government? So you mean when Kamla was busy accusing Manning of spying on the government, she had also been part of an administration that had done the same thing….illegally…. without any proper legislation?

This morning I had a breakfast date with a pretty special 3 year old, some princesses, a pirate, a cowboy, a space ranger, an ogre, some superheros and many other of Clark's favorites. We were invited to a Character Breakfast at our good buddy Jack's school. Jack attends one of the Montessori schools in town and they held their annual character breakfast. It was my 3 year old's dream- Chick-Fl-A catered and meeting some of his favorite characters. In his mind it does not get much better.

Ms. Cook had been thinking of leaving her marriage for several months. She preferred to stay home with the children, but he wanted her to work. She resented the long hours he spent on his new business. Therapists say marriages break up over time due to many factors, but Ms. Cook remembers the moment she knew her marriage was over: While she was hospitalized during her second pregnancy, her husband came to visit—and talked on and on about his business. “I thought, ‘Is this how it’s going to be for the rest of my life?’ ” Ms. Cook says.

Feeling OK even though it’s pretty busy with people in the bus station. I have slight anxiety sitting here because of the sheer amount of people walking along in front of me. I have some chocolate cookies and a large weak coffee with milk. I’m just chilling and taking my time as my sister told me to get to her apartment early evening. It’s soon early evening so am going to get a move on and get the light railway train and a bus to my sister’s.
So this is a fairly mega move for not only me but also for the label. If I revert back to my initial goals when I set out - THIS move was one of them to achieve in THIS year. How great is that.

Since physical pain wasn’t having the desired effect he took to playing mind games with her. He let her out of the box and told her that if she could make it as far as the road, about a mile away, before he caught her he would let her go. In her weakened state she was lucky if she’d make it ten feet. She stood there, her muscles quivering from being atrophic, hesitating. She knew he was messing with her, but there was still that spark of hope that she might. She didn’t, he tackled her to the ground like a defensive lineman sacking the quater back. Laughing he raped her in the dirt then dragged her back to the box.
I was nine months pregnant, and ready to pop. I’d enjoyed a largely trouble-free pregnancy, apart from constant heartburn since the moment of conception and my bump denying me the pleasure of sleeping on my tum. I had just stopped work in preparation for the Big Day, and was now bored out of my skull. I was definitely at the “OK, let’s get this kid out now” stage.

St. Louis actually might not be bad for Leinart either. (I don’t think Fisher has any desire to have Vince on his team again) I see it being less ideal as they would have to take on a mentor-type role to Sam Bradford and I don’t know that Leinart is willing (or capable) of filling such a spot, but after last season the Rams proved they could sure use some depth behind Bradford.

We practice doing this daily. I would hold up pictures and the students would have to use what they already knew plus the clues in the pictures to decide what was happening and why.

Well, the first thing Elm Publishing could do is put a ‘?’ at the end of the sentence in the above quote. Secondly, publishing in paperback and hardback does not make you ‘different’ than other self-publishing services, and allowing self-publishers to use their own purchased ISBN doesn't make you different either. There are many author solution services providing such options.
I’m not sure in other counties but it’s a very common idea, at least in Japanese comics, sometimes men have got too excited at some really sexual things like a woman’s nude to have a nosebleed.

Binggrae, unfortunately, is cheaper or same priced as Magnum (depending on the variant. Check ‘em out at selected grocery stores and Korean groceries) but creamier and elaborately designed. They even have Chiffon and Sandwich Ice cream. If they happened to be expensive at, let’s say, 40 to 60 pesos, that is understandable. For one, it’s imported from Korea. Also, I even noticed the pricing on some packages that some happened to be 400Won above, convert that to Peso (1 Won = 0.04 Philippine Pesos) and do the Math! Binggrae Melona is also my ultimate favorite. The price is like 20-30 pesos, really creamy and fruity at the same time.

I believe good writing always tells a good story, no matter if it is fiction or non-fiction. I juggle a couple of magazine articles, a blog post and at least two book projects on any given day. On top of that, I'm working on either promotions or speaking engagements for my books that are already out or upcoming release. I often have a fiction piece I'm either actively writing or pondering, both for children and adults. (I've had poetry and short stories published, too.)
Rachel is unable to gain any real satisfaction from tasks well done and has difficulty enjoying herself, unless alone; rejecting the true companionship of others. She demands attention but lacks depth in all relationships and has a hostile dependency issue. Rachel struggles to be in control of all situations and will lie profusely to gain control. She has an impaired social maturity, and cannot behave in a group setting as a mature adult. Rachel has trouble recognizing and expressing her own feelings appropriately, especially anger, sadness, or frustration. She also has immense difficulty recognizing feelings in others.

In a way, it's both good news and bad news that the author now has such a large part to play in the process. Bad because promotion takes very different skills to writing and also because it takes time and energy away from the actual process of writing; good because it does enable writers to have some control over the content and methods by which they are publicised. I remember when my books were first published, I was warned not to do anything at all, but to leave all the publicity to the 'experts'. But the truth is that no one is going to give your books - and indeed your career - the same amount of focus and attention that you can bring yourself.
