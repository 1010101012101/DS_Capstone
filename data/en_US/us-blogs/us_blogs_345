"She had been stripped of all defences, for the sake of her aged guest, of the sad old man. She was naked and she would not awaken. Eguchi felt a wave of pity for her. A thought came to him: the aged have death, the young have love, and death comes once, and love comes over and over again. It was a thought for which he was unprepared, but it calmed him - not that he had been especially overwrought.
Opponents of raising effective marginal income tax rates on high-income taxpayers claim that higher rates would discourage them from working, thereby reducing labor supply and harming the economy. But for high-income taxpayers in particular, as Leonard Burman recently observed, “evidence suggests their labor supply is insensitive to tax rates.” The empirical evidence on how U.S. taxpayers have responded to tax increases indicates that, at most, high-income taxpayers respond to large cuts in tax rates with negligible increases in work hours.

According to The American Journal of Cardiology, older adults who started swimming a few times a week cut their systolic blood pressure by nine points in three months. Swimming is ideal for older adults because it includes minimum weight-bearing stress and decreased heat load and can be very enjoyable.
Andrew: We once played 3/4 of a gig with our monitors on but no front of house (there was no sound engineer). It was in a noisy bar and I think people just thought the sound was terrible. That was until someone eventually came and suggested to us that maybe the speakers weren’t working.
Enough of this sappy blog and my philosophizing. I just had to write out my thoughts to try to make sense of what I was feeling. I only hope some day I can share this moment with the others I love.

At Trunk’d Clothing we love to shop and we love fashion otherwise we wouldn’t be in business. However, what we love even more than fashion and shopping is helping others. Starting Trunk’d Clothing has been a long process and one that we have worked very hard on. Trunk’d Clothing has been completely funded without the assistance of any type of bank loan or financing because we know how hard it is out in the financial markets to get banks to listen to your ideas and vision. In the current economic climate it would be easier for us to finance it ourselves and then we wouldn’t have to explain or justify our business plan to a lender. Self funding may take us a lot longer to become established, but we have a lot of faith that we will be successful as our source for all things is unlimited.

And I got three instead of two. Normally (by “normally” I mean “before John was incarcerated and the redhead stopped eating” and “excluding that six month period in there last year where the redhead went through a divorce and stopped eating also”) I’d get three fish for a meal – or two fish and fries. (One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish? Wow. Tired. Slap-happy.) But lately (and last year during the aforementioned time period) I’ve only gotten one or two – and usually didn’t even finish them. You’ll be happy to note I finished them, except for the few bites I gave the pooches because they were being good dogs.
But I certainly understand the appeal: the "zombie plague" trope may be trite and overdone and ripe for paraody and simply boring by now, but the reason it lingers in pop culture is pretty much solely attributable to the success George Romero found in his original Dead films - specifically, Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead (although I know that Day has its fans as well). Those films are "zombie movies," but (and this is hardly a new idea, so please forgive the reiteration) they aren't about zombies. Zombies have no personality, no charisma, no presence. The point is simply to see what happens to people when you put normal people in the pressure cooker of an impossible situation of survival in the face of the strangest, most soul-deadening circumstances possible. Zombies aren't individually a threat, but they tend to come in waves, and the immanent threat posed by tons of decaying flesh possessed by an insatiable appetite has a tendency to shred even the sturdiest disposition.

She was OK, just walking very slowly. Eventually we reached that sort of chiselled in the rock switchback section. It was possible to see the end, to some extent. The trail was just going up and up back and forth, as expected. It was covered by snow, but it was still fine to walk. I wasn’t rushing anyway. I saw a group of thinly dressed teenage boys going down, they were wearing city shoes and had a couple of water bottles. I hope they knew what they were doing, otherwise they had a long cold way up. There was also a family – two ladies and three kids – going up. It seemed that they stayed at the Indian Garden because they just had daypacks. They would pass me, but then I would pass them when the were resting. Then the cycle would repeat. Maintaining a steady pace is the most efficient way to go.

In general, under U.S. copyright law, any person who creates or produces a work owns any and all copyrights to that work. The exception to this rule, is when the work is created as a ‘work for hire’. If working under contract with an employer (as an employee or paid contractor), and any work created or produced is deemed as ‘work for hire’, the creator (employee/contractor) forfeits any copyrights, and they are granted to the employer/client who commissioned the work. In such an arrangement, the contractor (freelancer) will be paid a flat fee upon completion of project and will hand over all finished works and related documents/etc to the client. The client may freely use, reproduce, market, share the project as often as they see fit, with no additional acknowledgements and/or commissions paid to the original author/designer/creator. Usually, the contractor is discouraged or disallowed from advertising the creation as their own as well.

A 20-something male student said: “I think it’s one of those word that you have to choose extremely wisely when it use. (obviously very offensive to some people and should generally not be said, although I do think women over exaggerate its offensiveness, which is the only real reason it shouldn’t be said). However, it can at times be so appropriate, when some people are just so unspeakably awful, etc. It’s just a word after all.”

**Fun Fact: Did you know that Monsanto had a ad campaign in France in 1998 promoting the labeling of GMOs (rather than having them be outlawed all together)? Lambrecht's book quotes one advertisement as saying, "You have a right to know what you eat, especially when it's better…After several months of debate, Europe has just adopted a new law for the labeling of food that comes from genetically engineered plants…We believe that products that come from biotechnology are better and that they should be labeled."

An erasable moment came this past Tuesday in the wee morning hours – 5 a.m., to be exact. I’m not sure if Anna is going through some toddler growth spurt, but my ridiculously picky child has turned into the human garbage disposal. Now instead of forcing her on the ground and putting food in her mouth (not that I’ve done this…or have I), she’s always asking for something to eat. I like this. Except when it’s 5 a.m.
It all started with my work. I was a marketing and communications director at a large company. And I had just signed my company up to be the sponsor of a marathon/half marathon/5k weekend event. It was a great match for our company, and many employees, including senior people, were excited to participate.

In other words, children are treated as property of the state in state educational factories and are forced to work. If they don't work they are punished. Children can be held against their will from the time they enter the state educational system; they are deprived of the right to leave (and, should they leave, they are branded as truants and their parents - as the children's legal represntatives- will fall foul of the law and be punished by it). Children can neither refuse to work nor demand compensation for the many years of servitude they pass through in the state educational system.

I told Lynnette everything I just told you and she said “Are you alright?” “I don’t know,” I said. “I have this massive headache.” “You don’t look so good,” she said. “I know,” I said. “My eyes are super-red and puffy. I don’t know why.” Lynnette has seen me through illnesses before, and she seemed legitimately worried. She said my eyes looked like a “serial killer’s” and that she was preparing to call her family and friends to say goodbye in case I murdered her later that night. This seems like hyperbole, but she was mostly serious. Madison, to he credit, didn’t even notice.
A gorgeously laid-out, banquet-style dinner at Kristin and Jason’s house mellowed into a campfire gathering outside later in the evening.

My agent was also right there through it all, making sure I understood what everything meant and asking questions I hadn’t known to ask. She also kept me updated on marketing efforts, print runs, how the bookstores were reacting to the book. She definitely had my back the whole time.
In this verse, the first fruits is symbolic of Israel. The “whole lump” would be the whole commonwealth of Israel, which would include those grafted-in Gentiles that would thereby be the multinational extension of the commonwealth. If Israel is holy, then those Gentiles who have joined themselves to the greater commonwealth through the Messiah, are holy.
When people talk to Don and I about our desire to relocate to a tropical destination, our kids are always a concern. We each have 2 children, Don has Tyler 22 and Cheyne 20 ...

I would also like to try their new year-round release, Kellerweis Hefeweizen.

So we were in Glasgow yesterday (man and I). It's not somewhere we get to very often but, considering it's November, it was a lovely day so mostly we just did strolling around and looking at things in the city centre. A lot has been done in recent times to clean up Glasgow's centre and you would have to say that a lot of it is looking very smart and spruced. It always reminds me of Leeds in some ways... and yesterday, with all the hills, it even made me think of San Francisco a little (that might sound odd but I think if you added in some streetcars and a few hundred thousand tourists you might see the resemblance too).

Then you close up the pouch, secured by Velcro and they’re snug and safe. A great way to travel with a couple toys for my boy!

The Greystones scores well on having a good beer range and I admit that this was a bit of a quandary. I didn't want to get drunk, but I did want to fit in another pub at least. In the end, I decided to get the bus down to the end of Eccy road and pop in the ex Pomona, now renamed the Ecclesall. At least, that's what I wanted to do.... However, a 35 minute wait for a missing bus meant it was gone half three before I set off so I changed my plans. I decided to get off in town and walk to the Sheffield Tap. Since I had to go to the shops for some booze supplies for the night ahead I thought that if nothing else, I could get some draught beer to take out from there.

Of course, I realise that the current audience of us Emos are the ones the director is trying to oppress with all this set dressing, but what if the director and screenwriters had trusted their material more?

I can see why his publisher might have mentioned the Goons and Peter Cook but, for me, they’re a bit of a stretch; the book is neither silly enough to evoke the Goons not satirical enough to suggest Peter Cook at his best but if you appreciate both of these then you’ve clearly got the right mindset to give Verruca Music a go.
Anyway, I had my pieces cut to size. This in itself was not very simple because the measurements need to be exact, as they fit together like a puzzle. It would be simpler if 1x6 and 1x8 boards were actually 1x6 by 1x8... but unfortunately this isn't the case. You have to adjust for the width of the wood, which for the 6" wide pieces ended up being 5.5625". Could they have chosen a more random number? So I had to tell the poor HD cutting operator to try and cut to exactly that number. He did his best, but things weren't perfect.

There have been many rumors that the New Federation, in its fight against Los Zetas, was being helped by the Mexican government. (Some of those rumors have come from the New Federation itself.) During the New Federation’s offensive against Los Zetas, federation enforcers have been seen driving around Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo in vehicles openly marked with signs indicating they belonged to the New Federation. While far from conclusive proof of government assistance, the well-marked vehicles certainly do seem to support the cartel’s assertion that, at the very least, the government did not want to interfere with the federation’s operation to destroy Los Zetas.

I had both today, this morning when I woke up. Voices, that is. The Voice was predominate, as usual lately, but I also was able to distinguish the faint whisperings of my own mind..something that I have been incapable of for quite some time. I relished in the sweetness of my awareness as I actually ate something I needed to this morning. Too bad, ‘for it was too short lived. Granted, in this vulnerable position in which I am living, I was fairly predisposed to eventually losing the slight progress I was allotted upon my awakening. However, I do believe that your opinions served as the smallest of catalysts, if I may.

You should always have a positive attitude that you can reduce your weight. This will encourage you to control your diet and find ways to solve this problem. Wash your home on week offs; this will help to burn out extra calories without wasting even a single minute of your valuable time. You should cut down your daily hours you spend on watching TV. Try and indulge yourself in fat burning aerobic exercises. The other activities that can prove helpful to you are swimming and cycling. Thus by doing productive activities you can reduce a great amount of weight without wasting your time in gyms.

Then (no matter if you have the cross or have torn up the post-it) ask God to show you or tell you what the truth is. Close your eyes and wait. If you have trouble hearing God pray this prayer with someone else in the room and ask them to listen for God’s truth as well. Once you hear the truth or are told the truth by someone else write the truth down on another post-it (I like different colors for lies and truth but use what you’ve got) and put the post-it somewhere you will see it daily. Ask God to remind you of this truth every time you see it.

Don’t you think, that for a planet with over 7 billion people on it, a day to celebrate motherhood is just a little out of date. Don’t we really need a day to celebrate child-free women? Shouldn’t they be the ones to get the praise and appreciation, and tax breaks, and WWIC (Women Without Infants or Children) food aid, and housing vouchers, so they can afford their own apartment without shacking up with some jerk who will inevitably knock them up? I mean, I don’t want to condemn the selfish, irresponsible, dimwits who have the nerve to reproduce in the face of global ecosystem collapse. I just think that, women especially, who choose not to reproduce, deserve special gratitude from society as a whole.
Now the number four is made up of three and one (3+1=4), and it denotes, therefore, and marks that which follows the revelation of God in the Trinity, namely, His creative works. He is known by the things that are seen. Hence the written revelation commences with the words, "In the beginning God CREATED." Creation is therefore the next thing—the fourth thing, and the number four always has reference to all that is created. It is emphatically the number of Creation; of man in his relation to the world as created

Therefore, the Apostle emphasize very strongly in their warning about the end of the world that we must beware of deception. St. Paul says in II Thessalonians 2:9-11: “The coming of the lawless one, by the activity of Satan, will be with all power and sings and lying wonders… God shall send (that is, allow) a strong delusion, that men should believe a lie.” That is, it will be something very deceptive.

There are many different ways to apply colors to astrological signs and planets, perhaps because there are many different *things* that have color. Many people give opinions about the colors of astrological things without referring to any source. I think that is rather unimportant of them. There is an excellent book (unfortunately out of print), called The Circle of Stars. Page 27 of that book lists the colors connected with the signs – and this is based on a very thorough Cambridge Ph.D. assessing a wide variety of Sanskrit source material. Here are the colors -

I really never thought that our family was different or that I was fulfilling an unusual role for a child. Once when I was in third grade, a classmate came home with me after school. As I introduced him to my Mom, I noticed his mouth was wide agape. Mom was pleasant to him and he sort of meekly waved to her. As we walked away to play he said, “You never told me your Mom is deaf.” I replied: “You never asked.” The same thing happened when my folks came to teacher conferences with me when I was in Middle School. My French teacher told the whole class the next day about my deaf parents. I didn’t like that sort of attention. As I got older, I tried to get out of interpreting for my folks. I could see there were two worlds: the deaf world and the hearing world. I didn’t want to be in the deaf world any longer.

In an effort to both explore more science fiction and keep the eye from becoming nothing but Star Trek and soft core erotica, I present Planet of the Apes Week. All this week, I am going to post about the movie series, its themes, its spin offs, and its impact on culture. I have to confess that, while I have seen every filmed adaptation and spin off, including the short lived animated series, I have never read Pierre Boulle’s original novel, Monkey Planet. I should probably track it down at some point, assuming there is an English edition readily available. But I have not done so as of yet, so there will not be any commentary on the novel. I have never read his other famous novel, The Bridge on the River Kwai, but I have enjoyed the classic movie’s treatment of the nihilistic horror of war. I will give him props as a fantastic writer.
I would have something to eat and feel lightheaded, nauseated and disoriented. I was also on the least amount of sleep of my life and in the most pain after childbirth, but it was starting to be clear that I was not well.
Throughout the week, further pasos – which means steps in Spanish – depict scenes leading to the crucifixion: Jesus being condemned, carrying his cross, on it, removed from it. Like the narratives in churches’ stained glass windows, this was a very sensory way to tell the important stories of Christianity to the young, the illiterate, or just the visual and tactile.
I made a scarf with all the knitting stitches I learned with my teacher. I also made a book with the crotchet stitches I learned, I still have both. The yarn for the scarf is the same one I used to make the dress I told you before, this one of the few balls of yarn my parents bought me.
It may have cost me several hundred dollars, but I was stirred from my doldrums and began feeling much better. I was still doing little that was truly constructive, but I had reached such depths of dormancy that going to the Y for a session on the treadmill and playing a few rounds of online Scrabble now seemed pretty ambitious. I even called and checked in at the office, and volunteered to work a shift on New Year’s Monday, shortening my extended vacation by one day.

Paul Lemberg refers to the Comfort Zone phenomenon as leading business managers to become “fat, dumb, and happy.” In other words, becoming complacent when things are going fine. This can lead to becoming reactive with your strategy, rather than proactive. Do you want to be reconfiguring your department under duress at breakneck speed at the last-minute, or would you rather plan well ahead of time when the pressure is off?
A recent commentary in this journal by Byskov et al. (2005) claims that, despite published results from numerous independent lines of investigation from our laboratory and others, there does not “exist any evidence for neo-folliculogenesis in the adult mammalian ovary.” While we agree with Byskov et al. that our work represents a radical departure from the age-old dogma that mammalian females permanently lose the capacity for oocyte and follicle production during the perinatal period, careful examination of all of the available data leaves no doubt that adult female mammals retain the capacity for oogenesis and folliculogenesis. These findings do not change the fact that exhaustion of the oocyte pool occurs with advancing chronological age–a process responsible for driving the menopause in women–but rather question the basic mechanism underlying age-related ovarian failure. In this regard, studies of aging male mice have demonstrated that testicular atrophy is associated with a dramatic decline in the number, activity and quality of germline stem cells that maintain spermatogenesis during adulthood (Zhang et al., 2006). Therefore, to the contrary of the opinion of Byskov et al. that such a process would be “considered exceptional among stem cells,” it is certainly reasonable to hypothesize that a similar deterioration of female germline stem cell function underlies the decline in oocyte quality and the onset of ovarian failure in aging females. Further, while we accept that a departure from conventional thinking can take years to gain widespread acceptance, we feel this resistance to change should not be construed as the sole means to voice opinions about the validity of our data or the maturity of our principal conclusion.
As smart grid metering systems expand across the developed world, many are starting to ask whether the threats posed by the new devices, which officials promise will save energy and reduce end user utility costs, outweigh their benefits. In addition to documented health concerns resulting from radiation emissions and no cost savings being apparent, opponents of the technology argue that smart meters are violative of basic privacy rights and give the government yet another digital node of unfettered access to monitor and control personal electricity consumption.

Another touch that leapt out at me was the stranger's hand. In one scene he ghosts his hand down Ruth's arm, under her clasped hands, while the camera focuses up close on her hands. When his fingers become visible from beneath hers, they are not just regular hands, or smeared with some dirt or make-up. They have ground in blackness around the nails. Not loose, as if they were a movie prop, but as if he had actually been in the forest for 8 years. Many impressive little details like this add to the reality of the story.

FINISH/COVERAGE
A long time ago I picked up some artist trading cards at the craft store. At the time I didn't know what they were. I just thought the little 2 ½ X 3 ½ inches cards were cute. They also come in a variety of papers so I thought it would be a great way to try out paper without a big investment. Last week I tucked a package into my purse along with a micron. My thinking was that I could pull them out at work when/if I get caught up and need something to keep busy. I am interrupted often at work so an ATC is great. A smaller size gives me smaller sections to work on, so I can fill them quicker and not worry about forgetting where I was.

One question that must be asked immediately is why the submission is omitted from the list on the Inquiry web site. It was sourced via the Gilbert + Tobin Centre's own index of submissions. There may be a reasonable explanation for this, but in the interests of transparency it should be stated.
The decision brought on an early slew of applications from local atheists, who apparently were so offended by the presence of a manger scene that they felt compelled to submit more tasteful displays – such as a crucified skeleton dressed as Santa Claus, and a sign depicting Jesus flanked by Santa and the Easter Bunny, referring to all of them as myths. Take that, kiddies!

I should mention the rug here because we were all happily staring at it the whole time as we listened and read and spoke to each other. It consisted of small squares of color mostly in the red to yellow range. I used to be a rug person (I sold them for a while at a gallery) and I must say this was a great rug. The yellow gold of the squares echoed the memorabilia scattered around the room, especially things that seemed to be from Tibet or Nepal, with their distinctive colors. That room was incredibly warm and comfortable, redolent of Leslie’s life with Tom and the tastes and interests they shared. It was scary in a way, as many of us have rooms that are nice and reflect ourselves and our loved ones. If you’ve ever had to dismantle such a room or if you think about doing that, you know what I mean. And yet death is part of life. It’s not illegal, politically terrible or inherently evil, though it somehow feels like it should be.
How often do I take You for granted? How often do I take the credit, rather than giving You the praise? How often do I get mad at You, even if just for a moment, when life is less than perfect? How often do I pass up the opportunities to share You with those around me? How often do I not make time for You? How often do I consciously decide not to take a few moments to listen to You and tell You how much I love You? Seriously. How often? I’m certain that the answer would shame me. The thought has my eyes welling with tears as I speak.

Samuel is hard to like initially. He is so cold, abrasive, and closed down. His negativity permeates through the pages of the book making him someone I disliked very much.

Houda al-Habash, a conservative Muslim preacher, founded a Qur’an school for girls in Damascus, Syria when she was just 17 years old. Every summer, her female students immerse themselves in a rigorous study of Islam, in addition to their secular schooling. A surprising cultural shift is underway—women are claiming space within the mosque, a place historically dominated by men.
Joyful and drenched in rain, I began to wonder when was the last time I walked in the rain. Not the “ I was stuck in an unexpected downpour in the city, desperately trying to shield myself from the droplets that threatened to ruin my hair and clothes as I sprinted mindlessly to work, kind of walk.” No. I am thinking of an intentional, carefree and mindful walk, paying attention to everything around me and how it makes me feel. This morning it was just the Lake, the Forest and me, calm and contented. Bliss and love, some would call the emotions I felt, but this was a connection with life that stretched beyond the boundaries of my limited human perception. This was magic happening in the moment and I was quick to recognize its importance. Thank You Rain, the Lake and the Forest…..

In 1692, William’s representative in Ireland, known as the Viceroy, the future Earl of Romney (left), wrote that the Irish Parliament, which was legally allowed to consist only of members of the Church of Ireland, were ‘a company of madmen’, all of them seized with fury that harsher measures had not been taken against the Catholic population. They point-blank refused to support the king’s laws from 1691 and since William’s victory had come through the support of parliament, he was not in a position to ignore the wishes of the

I have a few last minute tasks to keep me busy while I oversee the packing. In true Aussie style, I have no idea when they will show up, or how many packers will come. No one called to let us know like they said they would. Oh well, I'll be up and ready for them bright and early. No worries! I think I have the hang of this laidback life. ;-)
I usually expect ideas to just come to me. I will get on with the job as I have been told to do it and hope that fresh ideas on making the process better will just formulate in my head. And sometimes it works. Understanding the system already in place allows me to then build on it. But as I get busier and have a lot more to think about the ideas stop coming. There is just no room in my head to formulate new ideas!

Dear Jenna, I've completed my first manuscript a few months ago and have since received 7 acceptance letters, however 5 are from "self-publishing" companies. One from PA and one from Dorrance. PA has already sent me a sample contract and an Aug. 1st deadline but after reading your comments, now I more confused then ever. Bottom line, I have no funds for Publishing law firms nor Self-Publishing companies. I'm looking for the name of a legit company that can help me without costing an arm and a leg.
Delving into a little bit of ancient Indian culture, you see that colours meant a lot even in terms of religion and spirituality. The Trinity- Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the preserver and Shiva, the destroyer- are represented together with Red, White and Black. The Five Elements, or the Panchabhuta, are also represented thus: Earth- Red, Water- Orange, Fire- Yellow, Air- Green, and Space- Blue. Talking about the Five Colours (Pancharang) it is quite powerful in different philosophies like Egyptian, Chinese, Babylonian, Hindu, Buddhist and Greek. There is a similar set of five colours (the actual colours used in each philosophy differs) representing the basis of the universe. In the Hindu stories, Surya or the Sun God is known as the Saptasvavahana/ Chitrabhanu as the seven horses that draw his chariot are Sveta(white), Rakta(red), Krisna(black), Pita(yellow), Harita(green), Kapisa(grey) and Nila(blue).

Why is Compassionate Conservatism framed in inverted commas? Why is it even a phrase at all? Those who use the term are obviously seeking to deflect the accusation that Conservatives are inherently uncaring compared to, say, socialists and liberals. in this case, they are knocking their own position, and this doesn't make any sense when you are trying to argue for it.

Let me give one instance, and with all due deference to any distiller who may be present, I think that he will admit my point. I have known of hogsheads (54—55 gallons), sherry shaped, being made and sold at 15s. to 16s. These were shipped to the Continent; they bore no mark, either of maker or manufacturer, yet a father should surely know his child, as it were. I have seen these hogsheads, made by myself, within a few weeks' time in varied distilleries, having been imported from the Continent as fresh sherry casks. Inside, you found a nice crust, as if they had been for years in some old vaults, but, alas, were purely so manufactured, manufactured to sell at 36s. to 40s., with but small cost to the seller, and little advantage, if in many cases any, at all to the bonder. Do we not in many instances thus play into the hands of the foreigner, without knowing the disastrous results that follow to workmen in our own country."

Which brings us to the Coens’ film of True Grit. Part revisionist Western, and part Classical throwback, the film works surprisingly well, thanks in no small part to the quirkiness of the Coens’ direction (their style is much more subdued here than usual, but still present in key ways). The performance of Jeff Bridges is rather remarkable, too. He’s no larger-than-life personality like John Wayne, but he takes the role of Rooster Cogburn and turns it into a real character. Part of the skill in his performance is how well he blends gruffness, humor and even sentiment, often within the same scene. In her big-screen debut, Hailee Steinfeld is perfectly cast as the 14-year-old Mattie Ross, who seeks out US Marshal Rooster Cogburn, a man possessing – she is told – “true grit”, to help her get revenge on Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who shot and killed her father.

For the record, I say these things as someone who has absolutely no desire to see a new/revised/expanded ending to Mass Effect 3. I fully went into the game expecting Shep to die. In truth, I expected Shep and/or Shep’s love interest to plunge themselves into the fiery heart of the Crucible, thereby becoming the Catalyst and saving the galaxy. I appreciated this not being the ending, as such an ending would have been predictable and cliche. Which would have made it several orders of magnitude better than the way in which the game did end. Changing the ending, however, even if those changes make the ending better, does not change the fact that I have already experienced the ending – it is now a part of me. I would much rather that it has been done right the first time instead of supporting a petition to lock the door well after the horse has escaped, burned the barn down, made his way to Vegas and spent all my money on hookers. My point is not simply to log my own discontent with the ending, but to stand counter to those who feel that we should neither feel discontent, nor should we voice it. I will, however, say that you should voice it without being a dick… a point which I will freely admit many people have failed on.
Thanks for tuning in. Writing is cathartic for me. I don’t have a lot of people to really talk to on a daily basis. It doesn’t help to not have a vehicle or a reliable source of income; I can text a bit, but it’s difficult to make plans. I was never one for spending money, but now it’s kind of a necessity to save more than usual.

I smile at the idea that as long as I was tan, I was beautiful.... how simple....I had a friend named Jennifer Carroll who got a tan and didn't want it to peel and she took her big ole' bottle of lotion to jr. high school (because everyone knew that you must keep your skin properly hydrated so your tan wouldn't fade....) clearly it wasn't just my sister and I who wanted to be tan.... anyhoo...I'm off to watch baseball and try to sit in the sun... just kidding...I'm just kidding.... sort of.... I have a sickness - you people shouldn't judge me!!!

After 6 weeks on the road I am finally back in Tucson for a little R&R. Teaching my classes in Oral Placement Therapy (OPT) for Speech Clarity and Feeding is one of the joys of my life. Even though this takes me away from home I have felt for a long time that this is what I need to do at this stage in my career. Every once in a while I meet someone who confirms to me, once again, that I have indeed made the correct choice (I wish for everyone to have this experience in their careers). I was teaching my “Three Part Treatment Plan for Oral-Motor Therapy” class in Springfield, Massachusetts in March. Just as I was about to walk to the front of the room to begin a women in her mid-fourties rushed to the registration table totally out of breath. She had no idea who I was and said to me, “I have a terrible headache, my daughter is sick and I should be home with her. I have no idea why I am here as I am probably going to quit my job as speech therapy is no longer what I want to do. I didn’t sleep too well last night so forgive me if I rest my head on my arms and fall asleep.” My husband Phil, always the gentleman, led her to her seat and asked her if he could do anything for her. She just needed rest.

Magic Eye, 2006, however, did generate an interesting moment – all of the gallery-goers of L.A., with their designer clothing and dark rimmed glasses, waiting, straining and squinting to see God’s life giving touch to man in a giant Magic Eye. A parlor trick, yes. Funny, yes. The strategies of Jeff Koons replayed, jostling with the taste of all around. But now that Koons’ magic has worked on us over the years, exposing our art historical textbook taste, Johnson’s painting comes across like a harlequin in the street trying to borrow a quarter from your ear.

I was very proud of Mana on this trip, she is trying things that would normally have her saying NO. After riding the Incline, she decided that she was going to go on the swing bridge with or with out me. She headed straight to it and turned around and looked at me like this is going to be a piece of cake, come on Momma! She went right on and thought nothing of it. My little girl is growing up.
The wide, ruffled turquoise ribbon that Really Reasonable Ribbon sent me was a perfect match to this paper pack I'd been neglecting for awhile. I added a lace trim on top of the turquoise and also used white ric-rac around the owl's frame to add interest. I'm really pleased at the result!

Last year, Chinese learned via the Internet that the son of a former vice president of the country—and the grandson of a former Red Army commander—had purchased a $32.4 million harbor-front mansion in Australia. He applied for a permit to tear down the century-old mansion and to build a new villa, featuring two swimming pools connected by a waterfall. (See related article.)

Phenomenal. The IRS is sending $4 billion per year in refunds to illegal aliens. These refunds are based on fraudulent claims by the illegals for child credit on approximately 4 million children living in Mexico. Some individual refunds exceed $10,000 per year. The IRS knows the claims are false, but refuses to stop issuing the refunds to illegal aliens.

What helped snap me out of my recent funk (although I had good reasons this time) was the theater, which will come as no surprise to regular readers. I am moved by a live performance the same way others are moved by a piece of music or literature or a gourmet meal.
Shortly after I posted about making this, my mother-in-law told me that she had already bought me some wool for my birthday, which was blue, double knitting, from New Lanark AND enough to make this cardigan - exactly what I was planning to buy, what a lucky coincidence (and a lovely mother-in-law)! However, I am not allowing myself to start this until I finish my Fairisle sweater, which I have been making progress with, honestly.

So. I call Dave, and we arrange to meet again in Leicester, where he lives. During the journey there I wonder what I’m doing. A few days later, on the third anniversary of my marriage to Jack, I’m still with Dave, lying under a thin duvet on a lumpy, sheet-free mattress.
The villa has an L-shaped ground plan shape, is set around a large swimming pool with sun terrace paved with planks of larch treated with a white primer. The continuity of the interior of the living room and is secured by a glass wall that continues to spread around the perimeter of the house facing the sea view. Compared to the garden the house is almost suspended, because a continuous and smooth edge, detached from the ground, surrounds the house, determine the line of coverage, the line connects with the base, is defined by vertical sidewalls. Two walls demarcating the inlet side and the opposite border of the pool are independent of the structure and connected with it through a high window and continuous thought of as individual plates that slide, too detached from the line of soil and structure. Architecture is dry and clear, made so well by the economy of the materials used, steel and wood frame, glass for the side walls and cement floors for both internal and external. The only element of disturbance, at a scale consisting of a thin folded sheet which is held at a red carpet to mark the entrance. The garden was designed as a collection of Mediterranean plants with the edge of the sea area defined by a sinuously to the cacti, palm trees here and there are some underlying organic forms in which the white gravel of the materials are clearly delineate the Green lawns. The interiors are essential ports are designed as full-height panels of the same thickness of the partition, and then back to the wall on both the internal and the external room hallway are white lacquered opaque white as the walls the house, white as the wooden beams of the roof. The white fluid that surrounds the dimension of the interiors, white is also the kitchen island facing out to sea and pool. Gray are the seats of living a light gray shading into the white furniture and the gray cement floor. The dining table is the Saarinen Tulip, the chairs are the Series 7 by Arne Jacobsen, while the light above the table is a ball of light in glass such as the Stahl house. The charm of the Stahl house determined the character of the villa, its planimetric shape, its design philosophy with the choice of using the exposed structure. The whole house is a tribute to architect Pierre Koeing, perhaps the most brilliant architects with Craig Ellwood Americans who have given it a great contemporary American and world architecture.

Going back to the first week here, I remember I was beyond afraid. I was scared I was going to be judged by everyone. Were people going to like me? Were people going to think I was a little out of the box? After the first week had passed, and the Welcome Week activities had ended, I realized I had gained some of the most beautiful lifelong friendships I could have imagined. I met a few girls who are my best friends, and I've met a few guys who have taught me a lot of life lessons. What leaves me a little sour, though, is the fact that the girls I was very close with at home have drifted further and further away from me. No matter what, I will love them and will always consider them my best friends. It's just been difficult grasping the fact that we are all beginning to lead separate lives, and are moving on to what God has planned for us.

Many employers don't just want you to send them a resume and cover letter - they also insist that you fill out an online job application form. The problem is, the application forms usually ask for the same information that you'd find on a resume, plus they're clunky, inflexible, and cause your browser to quit unexpectedly. What's the point of them? Another hoop to jump through? A way of discouraging applicants who give in to their frustration and quit?
It came to my attention that there were others who didn't want to see me succeed. This added to my stress. For one thing, I still had to learn to drive that big old 65 ft. boat. Driving the boat has nothing to do with the required "sea time" that it takes to get your Masters License, sea time just means the time you've spent on the water, period... but, those who were behind me were confident that I could perform that task well. I practiced driving that boat, day after day. One Captain even pitched in and gave me some pointers. The Lead Captain, who had gently guided me to this point, said this, "No more going out with other Captains. They are confusing you. You need to "feel the boat"... you will figure it out for yourself." The very next day, with no one taking charge... just me, guiding my own course... I parked that boat! Beautiful, baby!
It has been a hectic few last days! Ending the week with a Thursday and Friday visit was the cherry on top. You have a cold, and seemed to have had it for the last few weeks. You are stuffy, ‘phlegmy’, coughing, runny nose, can’t breathe at all through your nose. Mommy and Daddy hate seeing you like that especially when we feed you. I think Mommy has a heart attack when it’s time to eat! Your food that is brought with you is chunky (the way you normally like it) but when your nose is stuffed it’s a lot harder to eat! I try to put the thought at the back of my mind, but every time we have a visit with you and I see that you are still sick it brings me back to the very first time we brought you to the hospital. Most of those symptoms you had, we brought you in concerned. From there it turned from concerned parents to child abusers. How did this happen? Why doesn’t anybody look to find the REAL answers. The one doctor said that because she has never seen anything like your perforation in the esophagus that it HAS to have been us who did it. So we had to have shoved a blunt object down your throat and into the back of your neck. YA RIGHT! Mommy sometimes just feels like screaming “NO!” or “STOP”, but it isn’t that easy. We have been happily accepting our visits with you and sitting and taking everything calmly. Even when they tell us that we aren’t really your parents anymore, that we are somewhat only because biologically we are. When that lady said that to me I swore I wanted to scream. But hey, it just proves that in the end we have strength, we have faith, and no matter what they say, we are right. So don’t you worry. Mommy and Daddy are going to get you back, and get you back soon. Trust me when I say that. I will never give up. Daddy will never give up. Your family will NEVER give up. You need us, and we need you. I can’t wait to see you on Monday, to be able to kiss your cheeks a million times and give you a nice hug. To see that smile! Your smile. It is a beacon of light, and it leads us through this storm.

But over these weeks—the hungry weeks—something seemed to click back into place inside me. Whether it will stay clicked remains to be seen, but I think I rediscovered the joy of cooking fresh and healthy meals for myself and my little family. All I could think about these past few weeks was all the glorious food I would make for my husband when I’m feeling better and he’s done with finals, and how I’ll never again take for granted the act of sinking my teeth into something delicious (oh, and then keeping it inside my body for more than 20 minutes, of course).
Under the curation of new artistic director Jonathan Holloway, the 2012 Perth Festival generated more energy than a windfarm in a tornado. My only real regret - and regret it I do - is that I missed out on Matthew Lutton's production of Richard Strauss's Elektra, of which the word of mouth was ecstatic. (You can read Cameron Woodhead's review here. As an aside on Lutton's direction, it's fair to say that I differed enormously in my response to his production of The Trial. Moreover, I recommend my ponderings on The Trial to new readers of this blog as a clear statement of my ideals as a critic). Elektra is rumoured to come here in 2014, so perhaps I haven't missed out entirely; but it's a long time to wait, and there's many a slip twixt cup and lip, etc. Cross your fingers, Melbourne.

If paramedics and emergency medical workers know what medications a person is taking, if the person has allergies or a chronic condition, they can make better decisions about treatment,” said Acting IDPH Director Dr. Craig Conover. “Delaying treatment can mean the difference between life and death in some cases. Something as simple as having your medical information on a yellow card in your glove compartment can potentially make a big difference in the emergency care you receive.”

Picture this scenario: You are African American and in a room full of people who happen not to be. In the room is a long table brimming with fried chicken and watermelon. You are hungry. By the way you love you some fried chicken and watermelon too. Would you not eat for fear of perpetuating some ill-conceived, mean-spirited stereotype or caricature? Ultimately if you didn’t eat, you would leave that place hungry. Ultimately you would have given others who hopefully aren’t even thinking about such things, power over you.

In The Hunger Games, Katniss is a kickass heroine that can take careof herself, must assuredly people die – the movie is a mashup of Lord of the Flies and The Running Man – and Peeta and Gale provide for a much hotter and far more complex love triangle than Bella, Edward, and Jacob could have dreamed up in a million years. The combination of the aforementioned points breeds a movie that accessible to both men and women, young and old. Alhough I am always slightly nervous when a beloved novel is modified and altered to make sense for the big screen, the reviews are overwhelmingly positive for this movie already. Critics have voiced that the movie captures the essence of the novel and fans of the book will certainly not be disappointed.
It is a long shot, but I can't help the following comparison. The 'Ego' fears the 'Inner Self' - it can't function or survive in the light of the 'Inner Self.' Today the 'egocentric West' fears the ancient man and his return to the ancient ways/place - they'd rather see it completely wiped off the face of the earth - totally destroyed. All while they look the other way, now clinging to the few stalks they have left. Today the West are weak and continues to weaken - struggling to look the rest of the world in the eye. The 'connection' with the ancient ways and their ancestors are all gone - they float like white foam, lost in a dark ocean.
HFCS is commonly fed to many commercial bees today, which is why more than 75 percent of the so-called “honey” sold on store shelves is nothing more than HFCS (http://www.naturalnews.com/034102_honey_consumer_alert.html). And since the GM corn crops from which the vast majority of HFCS is derived have been treated with imidacloprid and other pesticides, it is hardly surprising that these chemicals end up in commercial bee feed.

In retrospect, we find one very important common denominator, seen throughout this unique historical collection of artifacts. That is, that no matter when or where Srila Prabhupada and his Krsna devotees appeared, the mood and message was always the same — it was kirtan, bhajan, harinama sankirtana in the mood of Prabhupada and the Sampradaya Acaryas. No matter what sort of music was going on all around them, the devotees steadfastly preserved Srila Prabhupada’s mood in sharing our Krsna Conscious culture. Srila Prabhupada delivered the transcendental sound vibration of the Hare Krsna Maha-mantra purely and sweetly, and his disciples followed suit.

so this week was pretty good, I feel like Ive learned a lot I hope you all get my letters soon! but here is my weekly report, sorry its gonna be kinda short but I have several people who emailed me that I need to write back.
Admit - Father, I don’t want this life I live anymore, I am sick and tired of being sick and tired, I truly understand my condition now and I humbly come right now to the foot of Your Cross, I NOW invite you into my heart, I fully confess and forsake my sin and now I GIVE MY ENTIRE LIFE TO YOU, I put my trust COMPLETELY in You. I believe Your promise that I in the old am DEAD and now I’m ALIVE WITH YOU. In Jesus’ name. Amen!
When somebody says, “You’re no Thrall,” you can totally reply, “You’re right, Thrall would never just up and chop off somebody’s foot like that. Oh, I’m sorry, did I break your concentration? Pardon me. Please, let’s resume our critique of my job performance.”
We need the discernment of the Holy Spirit to distinguish the difference between condemnation and conviction. Condemnation is the work of the devil and is a downward spiral of hopelessness and despair that leads to destruction and death. Conviction is the work of the Holy Spirit who reveals the sin that has separated us from Him, but instead of tearing us down, He gives us hope, healing and freedom through His love, forgiveness, grace and mercy; and it brings about repentance that leads to life (2 Cor. 7:9-10).

8. (C) Sen. Feingold thanked the Prime Minister for his direct answers. He expressed hope that the armed conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia could be averted, and remarked that he would be surprised the USG were enthusiastic about an Ethiopian military intervention. At the same time, Feingold acknowledged that the GOE was in a difficult situation which he now understood better. Meles replied that no one, including the GOE, was enthusiastic about conflict, but sometimes circumstances made military action the only option.

If you’re out of power for learning, you have to recall to your mind the reasons why you decided to start learning your target language! Intrinsic motivation is one of the keys to succeed. Extrinsic motivation is not a good incentive for doing something, because you would perform an activity in order to attain an outcome (external reward: money, recognition, relief from pressure, etc.).Instead, your motivation should be intrinsic, which means that you started learning your target language because you enjoy the task itself! Intrinsic motivation is based on your personal commitment to the activity of learning, rather than working towards a “reward”.

The fact that the question – can we promote ecological sustainability through buying better things? – is taken seriously points to the absurdity of so much environmental discourse. We need to be clear: An industrial economy, no matter how green it declares itself, is inherently unsustainable. It is based on the use of nonrenewable resources and the hyperexploitation of renewable resources. In short, it’s based on drawdown. It’s a bit late in the murder of the planet to have to be saying this to environmentalists.
Yep. As usual I am a bit late on the uptake of "trends". I made these quickly tonight for someone (who is probably reading this!). I sure hope he/she likes them. They are made from coffee filters, white embossing powder, background stamps and lots of ink/bling. Some of them I am happier with than others. He/She will only be getting SOME of these so at least there is still THAT surprise. I hope they like them, for my first attempt at flowers what do you think?
Life demands a certain balance. We don’t want to spend time with those who can pull us down; we want to steer clear of temptation. But our holy God wants us to share true purity with those who desperately need it. He wants us to bring healing and hope, just as His Son did.
We look forward to this event all year long. There isn’t any discussion about whether or not we will be going the next year, it’s simply understood.

That's Rust-oleum Painter's Touch Ultra Cover 2x Matte Clear Sealer. You can get it in the spray paint department at Home Depot or the like. I printed the document on my scrapbook paper and then sprayed this sealer on it. Hold the can about 2 feet away from the paper and very lightly spray it one direction and then the other direction. You don't want to get the paper wet. You just want to spray on a light coating to set and seal the ink, so it doesn't bleed when you apply the Mod Podge. In the collage below you can see the difference that the clear sealer makes. I didn't use the sealer on the paper of the plaque on the left. Note the purple and black letters that bled into the surrounding paper. I applied the sealer on the paper for the plaque on the right. Much, much better.

Adam is a doll. He is so good natured and easy going. I have had all easy babies (or maybe I just have the magic touch right?) but he is the most good natured of all so far. He cries only when he is hungry or getting his diaper changed or having a bath. I can lay him down on the floor and he will look around contentedly for a while and then fall asleep. He is just so sweet.
Victorious characters can either take over the motte and bailey, which has no peasants around it so it must be supported by raiding, burn it down, or give it to the lord they feasted with on the way to the conflict. Although there are only three horses here, characters might take the livestock, although it is stolen property, so they can never sell it in good faith. Similarly, most of the items of treasure found here should be the grave-goods of someone or other, so to keep it might prove unfortunate and Pious Saxons will insist on destroying everything they can lay their hands on.
I used it along with a pattern I had picked up awhile back to make a note pad holder. The one from the pattern is on the right hand side. I didn't care for the looks of it so I started over this time using a binding on the edge. It turned out much nicer.
This story was a quick read. I finished it in two hours and I felt that this book can’t really hold its own. Compared to the Love Inspired novellas this book is a weak light weight. But then again, I don’t think this book was made to have much weight to it. I think it was supposed to be just a fun fast read.

In the past week alone I have found that writing has become not a new stress but a new and wonderful way to reduce my stress. I have found myself more motivated at work, in the weight room and at home. A month ago I would have told you that I spent 20 hours a day worrying about every little thing I could and obsessing over things that most people don’t even think of. A few nights ago I went home, cleaned the bathroom and sat on the couch for a while. I put my feet up and actually enjoyed just watching TV. Nothing on my mind except the content that I felt about being home with my wife (and of course, my dog).

Now, suppose that this statistical figure was true, this is a serious matter that churches must address. We cannot allow this to perpetuate because there are many people dying without knowing about Jesus. What must we as Deaf Christians begin to do or change in order to become better at sharing the gospel message to Deaf and Hard of Hearing people groups not only in U.S. but also in other countries? How can we faithfully fulfill the Matthew 28 mandate that Jesus gave us in the coming decades?
After that ending, I knew I needed to watch "Midnight Clear" every year at Christmas time. It cuts to the core of how truly difficult life can be for each of us, and offers an illustration of what "Peace on earth, good will to men" really means. Even after the movie has its hopeful conclusion, you know that these people will still have many of their same problems when they wake up tomorrow morning. They'll continue to struggle with loneliness, frustrations, and sadness. But you also know that each disappointing day has the potential to have a moment of hope, an encounter with a friendly human, to lighten the load.
She crossed her arms, the frown on her face deepening. “Wait a minute, are you suggesting I murdered Jake?” She let out a soft cry. “Oh my God! As I said our relationship was a friendship and one of mutual respect. I liked him. I liked him a lot.” The tears welled in her eyes again. ”He was an excellent doctor and a decent man. He was also my friend.” She wiped her face with the back of her hand, and tried hard to contain her emotion. “We were not intimate. We’ve never been. I don’t know where things were headed, Detective. But what I can tell you is there is no way in hell I killed Jake.” She shook her head vehemently.
"Hurt" - Johnny Cash. I can be happy if I make you hurt. That's because that's the only thing that's real. Actually, I think it's saying that I can be happy if I strike up a nasty heroin addiction. That's something I've been meaning to explore.

To make the fall tree, I used this tree stamp and covered the image with the Flower Soft Autumn Mix.

As for the Autumn Greetings stamp, its one I've had in my collection for a couple of years now. It's a favorite that I pull out every autumn! Okay, so back to the card...just stamp your image, mat it if you like, then adhere the image to only one side of the card. Here I went with the left side, so I can still open it from the front. Stamp your sentiment (I added a ribbon), then you have a cool fall card! I hope my pen pal likes it!
What a lovely topic to write about on the blog - but before I get carried away, here's what Gillian has in store for you!
The Field – In the Caribbean sugar monoculture, African children, women and men worked in the harshest working conditions ever – the Caribbean cane fields. Occupations involving sowing, weeding, cutting, caring, germinating, testing, research and development were done by the majority of the workers. The sugar cane itself was part of the stable diet afforded to Africans which is today the source of many health concerns. In the cane field, the typical daily work discipline of these 124 African cane field workers is described as starting at ‘sunrise, and finishing at ‘sunset’. The 124 workers may have been employed in teams of 20 to 60, or upwards, under the supervision of inexperienced white overseers, often new to management in the sugar monoculture. The overseers had their overseeing subordinates, such as the drivers or dog-drivers, who were mostly other Africans or Mixed Race, of the worst temperament whilst at work. Drivers were both men and women, such as the four on Wingfield; Manuel (Head Driver, 30 years, Male); Maryann Arnote (Driver of small gang, Female, 50 years); Daniel (Male, 40 years) and Jacko (Male 30 years). These drivers were all born in the Caribbean and none were ‘Mixed Race’. They were furnished with whips which, whilst on duty, they were obliged, on pain of severe punishment, to have with them. Drivers, were authorised to flog wherever they saw the least relaxation from labour; and to give no consideration to working conditions, and paying at the same time little or no regard to age, gender, marriage or blood relationship. (John Luffman). To the drivers the workers were like a level playfield there were no favourites, wife, children, parents, friend, everybody was flogged without reason as a matter of course.

Now, a good example of what I mean by authority is in the story of Mother Teresa. There is a city not too far from Eastern University where they have a state hospital. In the state hospital they have people who are emotionally and psychologically disturbed. It’s a huge place. Well, the directors of the hospital wanted to start these halfway houses so that people who were on their way to full recovery could be nurtured from the hospital back into society, by first going to these halfway houses and from there they could get jobs and, little by little, own their own residences. It was a transition stage and that’s why they wanted these five halfway houses. Needless to say, the people in the city weren’t particularly thrilled with the possibility of this prospect. There was a city council meeting. The place was packed. Five hundred people plus squeezed into this hall, yelling and screaming their opposition to the halfway houses. They didn’t want the, quote unquote,“crazies” living in their neighborhood.
After another drink we venture back to the La Catedral which is now pretty busy with tourists and handful of locals.

David encourages informal socialising after cafes and on this occasion quite a few people transferred to the pub. This to me was the most interesting and productive phase (and not due to the beer and football!). I had three really interesting and open one-on-one conversations with people I’d never met before (that covered a wide range of topics) but yet were motivated by the atmosphere of the café beforehand in some subtle way. Having a open and frank conversation with a stranger is usually quite tricky as barriers always go up.

WALKER: We’ve looked at the microeconomics of the life industry going back over the past 10 years. When you look at the industry as a whole, returns have been coming down fairly substantially in the past three years, driven by the financial meltdown. The industry, which used to exceed its cost-to-capital consistently, is now underperforming, leading to lots of economic pressure. Another long-term trend is the steady decline in the number of life policies sold. This has been going on for decades, as the industry has increasingly moved upscale, leaving the large middle market unserved. Also, when you look at the share of household assets, you see that mutual funds, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds and deposits are all building share. And, life insurance is the only area where it’s been a declining share on the consumer balance sheet.

And Soon the Darkness is mostly unremarkable. There is some nice work from Amber Heard, but Odette Yustman and the poor script more than make up for it. Efron appears to have talent as a director, and his cinematographic choices in the film are beautiful and effective. The trouble is that we have seen this underwhelming and predictable story hundreds of times in the past, and And Soon the Darkness stubbornly refuses to take things further, or deeper, than any other films. Instead, it stays on par, which is fine for golf, but not in the thriller genre. Nothing in this film keeps the viewer on the edge of his or her seat, but there isn’t enough bad to turn the movie off either. And Soon the Darkness does a sufficient amount to get the viewer’s attention, but then fails to deliver anything special throughout its 91 minute runtime.
The website also states that, “the original appearance of the station is not recorded, but it is known to have been smaller and simpler in form than the present building. A second storey was added in 1876 after the Grand Trunk Railway openly assumed management, and the station was remodelled in 1900 to its present form”. This is only a drop in the bucket when it comes to the history of this train station and its current status, but I hope that these photos will take you on a journey that might spark your imagination as to what it was like to ride the rails in the 1800′s.

A core group of us middlers played there every single weekend night. There was JC who acted as the club’s runner, banker, bouncer, booker, and comedian. There was Niko who ran around with, literally, an ivory tusk in his ear. He was an enormous black man with a teddy bear heart, plain and simple. There was Joe who was a dyed in the wool Irish-American from Brooklyn, probably going back several generations, and, as such, he seemed more Italian. There was Jay a newlywed from the South who lived with his wife in a hipster part of Brooklyn, which he half thumbed his nose at, regularly. And that was pretty much it. Those were the main players. There were lots of ancillary ones, as well, that gave the place color, but mainly these characters set the scene. Oh, and there was, US – the three, female, comedians, the only ones who JC deemed funny enough to play the room – me, Rayanne, and Miranda. A black, a Jew, and an Irish woman walk into a…well, you see what I mean, we were almost a living satire – the three of us. It was fantastic. You can not re-create the kind of vibe that we had at The Barrio. Those were magical times. Magical, magical times.
I had been tutoring for over two years when I lost my job. Not being too computer savvy, I called in my volunteer hours, as required, and right away the director asked “How are you” and I replied “Unemployed”. Again, “things happen for a reason”. She then proceeded to tell me about the summer VISTA position at the literacy council that I was selected for. While I couldn’t tutor students as a part of my VISTA position, (as VISTA does not allow for direct service) but I was growing again, learning new things, meeting people from all over (and getting new recipes too)! I thought I’d only do this for the summer while I searched for a new job, but the opportunities were dwindling and soon panic was setting in. When the organization was approved for a full-year VISTA, they asked me to stay and I did.

Do you have a picky little eater at home? Or maybe not a picky one, but one who does a better job when you serve their food in a fun and bite-sized way? I sure did!

But with the cheap, flimsy plastic cutters, they chip easily and then they don't cut well. Ugh. I hate that!

Anyway, here we are on the last day of February -- an extra day, which is a blessing, perhaps, though I am longing for winter to fully retreat (but never wish away days, I know; they are too precious for that). I've had the same hacking cough and sore throat as most of the rest of London, but lucky to have an afternoon with my mother at the Royal Academy's Hockney exhibition, which was glorious, despite the crowds. She was (and is) a very wise guide; and Hockney's landscapes are vivid reminders, amongst other things, of the particular joys of each of the four seasons. I hope that doesn't sound horribly Pollyanna-ish, to anyone who is gripped by the mean reds or wintry blues (I've been there myself), but the London sky was beautiful at six o'clock this evening, when darkness had not yet fallen. Tomorrow, will it be spring?

From the very popular Davy Crockett to Texas John Slaughter or Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox. One such mini-series was The Saga of Andy Burnett, staring Jerome Courtland, which was a six episode Western made with the Disney touch. The first three episodes aired from October 2- 16, 1957, with the last three episodes airing from February 26- March 12, 1958. Currently none of these episodes have been released to DVD.

Thank You Steven Moffet!! Stay over in Wales where Doctor Who belongs to continue being the best show!!! I'm sorry but I am not all that happy that Torchwood is over here, I think it is ruining it. You bring an iconic series like Doctor Who which is known for being a UK show and the scenery and everything else and you try to Americanize it it will turn to shit! (Does anyone remember that disaster Fox Doctor Who Movie with Paul McGann??) As much as I would love to see the cast over here for conventions and things like that, they need to stay in the UK so what makes Doctor Who can continue to do so and have it run for many more years!! I hate the majority of the shows over here besides a select few, I watch BBC America most of the time...lol Like right now I've been watching it while on here blogging watched Doctor Who with David Tennant in "The Girl In The Fireplace" now watching Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. I grew up watching Doctor Who, Monty Python, LoveJoy, All Creatures Great and Small(which stared Peter Davison as Triston who was the 5th Doctor) as well as so many other UK shows! Now my children are being brought up the same way...lol Yes I was born in the wrong country!! ahahahaha!!

Why don't you pick the first theme, pick the dates we wander with our cameras, and pick the day we need to post the photo? I'm not too keen on the friends theme, just because my real life friends, like me, are camera shy and Internet shy, and strangers might think you were some crazy stalker taking photos of them. I post lots of food photos anyway, so personally, I'd want to see that theme paired with something, like "garlic" or "fruit." But we could do that if you are in the mood to cook. I cook a lot more than you, I think, so that would be an easy one for me.

The sustained pitches in the uppermost part represent his initials: C, E, and H (“H” is the letter used in German to denote what we would call B-natural. They reserve “B” for what we would call B-flat). The piece is organized into three harmonic areas: F-major, A-major, and F-major again. This is a reference to atheist composer Johannes Brahms, who did something similar in his third symphony. The acronym “F-A-F” stands for “frei aber froh” (free but happy), an appropriate reference for a piece dedicated to a committed freethinker. The piece leaves off, however, before the third and final section is really able to re-assert “F-major.” We have to make do with an abrupt and unstable 6-4 triad, which would normally herald continuation to some kind of resolution. I think this is an effective and poignant analogue for the way Hitchens left us. This procedure is made all the more unsettling by the intrusion, into the “F-major” sonority, of “B-natural” (or “H”, for “Hitchens”) – the raised fourth. That “H” hangs there for a moment, then departs.

I started wondering what sort of people Russ might be in touch with, and if any of them were women, and how close they lived to us..."

The certainty language expressed in the Hansen NYT piece about the coming dustbowl fate for the Great Plains region and Midwest is contrary to the low confidence of regional climate change projections for coming decades as documented in USGCRP and IPCC reports. Not only are various regional patterns of trends that have been observed over the last century poorly understood, but the projections of regional changes in coming decades are highly uncertain.
Change the order of your exercises between workouts. The major lifts, like back squats, should be at the beginning of your workout, but after those are done, change up the order of smaller exercises. This will force your body to keep adapting to each new challenge. Additionally, it means that no exercise will always be done last, when you are most tired, ensuring similar progress on each exercise.

Why is it that so many people with “successful” careers find themselves bored, discontent, and depressed even after they’ve climbed the ladder, after they’ve earned their millions? Are they spoiled? Maybe. But some of these people are not, and they’re really good people deep down who have worked hard to earn their success. Might it not be that they are not doing what they were created to do?
The worst was I became so tired, could hardly move, seriously...could hardly move! A friend told me about a Naturopathic Doctor who (get this) worked 3 blocks away from my home and I made an appt. I was looking for the blood work to tell me why I was so big...and why I was so tired. This is the honest truth...I stood on the Dr.'s scale backwards so that I wouldn't know how much I weighed. How's that for DENIAL?
Following the moon night after night I am amazed by how many different ways it can look in the sky. Yet when I stop to watch it for a while, or for an hour or more, on any one night – wow, how still and present it looks in that moment, as if it is quite capable of holding that one long extended note endlessly. With ease such solid and timeless presence, the moon.

I'm still struggling a little with getting into the new work routine, especially with A being on school holiday. She's been off here, there and everywhere with various friends. She has been very good about keeping in touch, being home on time and doing bits of housework I've asked her to do. She's really showing how mature she's become, and has been very supportive to her working Mum.
Qaradawi possesses a worldwide following as a cleric; however, statements by him indicate his support of terrorist activities of such groups as Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

Background on this post: This is just a hypothesis, based upon some scientific research I have read. I first wrote this as a “note essay” back when I still had my LDS Anarchist account on Facebook. I decided not to publish it here because of its more scientific nature, but I have now changed my mind. So, here it is, in a slightly modified and updated form.
A short way into the game, Dan and Bo meet up with the rest of their team, which includes the businesslike ex-MI6 dude Charlie (who doesn’t know who James Bond is); the strong, silent Brit woman Rachael; and the sexy Chinese girl Faye. These disparate characters’ personalities all clash a little with one another, which again makes their interactions extremely entertaining to witness.
It was obvious that Levon was busy getting dressed as we waited for him. I wandered around the house as Steve messed with his camera. I saw there was a great big central room where Levon's drums had been set up, clearly as the centerpiece for a constantly-changing band. In this wood-hewn room, I noticed a distinct difference in sound quality. It was as if every noise that was made floated into the atoms of the the timber itself. When I spoke, the words had a flattened yet resonant quality. It was a sound I had never heard. Standing in the middle of this regally gabled space, I felt as if I were in the center of hearing itself. I looked up and saw a huge American flag hanging longways from its ceiling, as well as the brightly yellowed "Don't Tread On Me" flag, hung properly, its snake spiraling upwards. I loved that the words "Don't Tread on Me" nearly mirrored my name in welcome. My being there seemed like divine providence.
Happy Friday the 13th, y'all! If there was anytime to talk about the Friday the 13th series it's now. It's an interesting movie because even if you haven't seen the original, you're probably not far off in guessing what goes on in in. Earlier on in my horror movie watching career I watched the entire series when I was 11 or 12. And holy hell are they boring. They just get more and more nonsensical. And frankly, I like a little bat shit crazy with my nonsensical. (see: Nightmare on Elm Street series) But there was one moment of the whole Friday series that scared the bejesus out of me.

I once wrote a list of names of people that were gone. It was a list of the names of the people that ejected me from their lives. That threw me out of their workplace. That severed all communication and contact with me. That made it absolutely clear by their actions, and their behavior, that I had a choice. I could be identical to them. Or I could be ignored by them.

When we hear from politicians, it is often the “squeaky wheels” of the group: The loud voice who, although occasionally charismatic, is not necessarily the majority. But because this voice and the opinion it happens to express gets attention, it can seem like everything is doom, no one agrees and our political world is falling apart.
As I got older, I watched my dad take risks and lose it all. Eventually, my father became everything I wanted to be the opposite of. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my father with all of my heart; but it has been difficult to watch him suffer over the last ten years. The way he feels about himself shows in the way he dresses and talks nowadays. I no longer know the dad I knew growing up. Life broke him. And I made a promise at nineteen that I would never let life break me. I had no idea I would come so close.
Albert Pujols through 23 games:
“The Race for Theory” was written in response to a good deal of political fallout resulting from activism in previous decades. Much of the Western literary canon is composed of white, middle class male authors, and the Black Arts Movement of which Christian was a part in the 1960s was intended to contribute black authors to this canon. The feminist movement of the same era attempted to introduce female authors to this canon, but these authors were white, middle class and heterosexual, like the feminists themselves. Christian reveals to us that the Black Arts Movement had its own restrictions; like the feminist movement’s narrow definition of womanhood, this movement had a very specific notion of what it was to be black, which will be addressed in greater detail later in this paper (Christian 2133).
While many of you have told me to "just put things on hold for a while", that is not an option. If I had a 9 to 5 job, I couldn't just put it on hold and this business is no different.

Crochet, for me, provides flexibility and the ability to improvise. I love that it is quick, (I am a sucker for instant gratification.), and I love how portable and forgiving it can be. The drawback though is that it uses much more yarn than knitting and I often prefer the texture of a knitted garment to a crocheted one.

Still, there were times when I felt guilty for taking time to write, and when I felt like maybe I was just being selfish, or that all the effort just wasn't really worth it.

I only run for 30 minutes, the I do squats, planks, sit ups, I stretch up more and then I eat something. Our body is like a car, if you don't give it fuel, it won't work.

She agreed to try stripping my membranes, and giving me some herbs- but cautioned that it probably wouldn’t work because this was the earliest I had gone. She……helped………me at 10:00 on a Saturday Morning. I think I prayed more fervently than I had in a long time- 1) that baby would decide that today was in fact a great day to come, and 2) because I felt incredibly selfish that I had requested to be essentially “induced” via natural methods. (and this is not meant to offend those who do choose to be induced- it was just a tough decision for me to make.) She sent us on our way, and we went home to wait.

This version of this epic tale is set in current day and the two Antipholuses are Rap artists living on opposite coasts and backed up by their DJ Dromios. The entire cast of characters is played by four, very energetic, young men. Their portrayals of Adriana and Luciana were particularly entertaining. With all of the entrances and exits, costume changes, and break dancing these guys do, I can’t imagine having to do more than one performance a day.
Only as the fragmented shards of the Japanese national psyche dealing with the guilt and fear and recriminations and denail of the post-war period can the film begin to make sense. The film affects us powerfully, its statements sear our brains, its psychological probing calls postwar Japan to task to deal with its past, and yet, what we see cannot be unified with the so-called ‘reality’ of any individual character. For in fact, we are watching probably one of the earliest examples of a truly transindividual film. And no attempt is made to justify how it is that we are magically transported to different locations in space, whether this is reality or fantasy, or many other details whereby the film seems to deviate from so-called ‘reality.’ We never learn why the woman just appears inside the room with them after they first hurt her outside. And yet, the film is not in anyway incoherent. Rather, it follows an immanent logic so tight that it could not have been any other way. As transindividual fantasy, one which develops like an organism, the film is completely rigorous, and as such, it affects us’deeply.

My post today covers both of those bases, but could also cover Father's Day as well. I used the Dreamweaver Stencils' Gears for the background, which I paste-embossed in Glossy White. The tie was paste-embossed in Glossy Black and set aside to dry before replacing the Tie stencil over the top. Then I placed the Gears stencil over the top of that, and paste-embossed the Gears in Glossy White over the top. I used this generic "It's Your Day" sentiment to create a banner across the card on the teal cardstock...the teal being the "pop" of color I was adding in conjunction with the challenge.
All of our louseworts have eatable tap roots, but other than the Woolly, most are too small to make it worthwhile to collect. Speaking of collecting, some species of voles collect lousewort tap roots and store them in small caches for the winter. The vole caches I have found are usually about a cup in quantity. Since these are such a good food source, the grizzly bear love to search out these vole treasures and feast on them. I watched one bear work several willow thickets in the river bed, and after a couple hours had consumed a large quantity of stored roots. I’m sure the voles weren’t too happy about this, but at least they didn’t get eaten on this day.
My last card is a really sweet, not too fussy or serious way to tell someone you are there for them. I just love that yo-yo image, and the baker's twine seemed like the perfect way to bring it to life. I also added a touch of color with Prisma watercolor pencils and little bit of Stickles glitter.
By the example of the disciples also we ought to be taught, that though we should have but little, we ought to give that to such as have need.

While I don't buy into the notion that Authonomy can help writers build readership--a few hundred reader recommendations hardly constitutes a following--I agree that showcasing a manuscript online is probably not an issue, as long as it's not being promoted for sale. The notion that merely by posting your manuscript online you exhaust your first publishing rights dates back to the early days of the Internet, when the concept of electronic rights was brand-new and it wasn't clear what sort of competition they might present to print rights. I doubt that many editors these days would be greatly bothered. (A more relevant question, in my opinion, is how bothered they might be that you’d posted your manucript on a website sponsored by a rival publisher--especially if you’re currently submitting your manuscript elsewhere.)

The question, though, to ask is why. Why did the dumb sexy objectified image of Marylin Monroe survived and not her feminist, politically involved, intelligent and well read side? Some might accuse Monroe for putting herself out there as an object, but the situation is more complicated than that. I will not get into the sad details of her life – the foster homes, the constant abuse – but her attitude is not one to judge. For a girl who never went to school and got married at the age of 17 for the first time, to self-educate herself, to spend long hours by reading Freud and Joyce is in itself a feminist attitude that should overcome the compromises Monroe did. However, I think it was more the public choice to see just one side of Marylin Monroe, than it was her own. If you read Jacqueline Rose’s article, you can see that Monroe did almost everything she could to put her intelligence out there, more than she wanted to put her beauty. But, people have prefered to both ignore and forget that, because at the end of the day most of us just prefer to think that women are beautiful and dumb. Marylin Monroe’s survival image just shows that a woman is going to be considered dumb before proved otherwise. And this proved otherwise most of the time means to sacrifice feminity or beauty for the sake of intelligence.
The end result? FABULOUS!

Mine should be less house, more home. Less fences, mote visits.
I am cleaning out the closet in my home office; tossing out stuff I don't need, can't remember why I had saved, &/or just moving stuff to gain more room ... for paper/pens/markers, etc. You know the drill.
“I’m not talking about them having sex,”Deeanswered. “They’ve known each other since they were babies, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if they got together. It would be kind of a, she thought, “a natural thing. Any guy and girl who know each other that long are going to eventually get curious about each other.” She glanced at Hank with a smirk.
I just finished reading Speedliter’s Handbook: Learning to Craft Light with Canon Speedlites by Syl Arena that was published in December 2010. There are many reviews of this book available, but I would like to add my point of view to the general praise for the book.
To get out of the doldrums, I made my debut non-volunteer visit to Juniper Swim & Fitness. I needed a fix. An endorphin rush.
Over the past 9 months, I have worked really hard to lose weight and have lost about 20 pounds. This was my personal goal. I began taking better physical care of myself after receiving some disturbing, not life threatening news about my health. Ironically, the news I received had nothing to do with my weight, but I took the news as a wake up call to start taking better care of my physical-self.
Over the last few years or so we’ve been getting regular communications from New York here at CAP Towers, and specifically from one Seamus Scanlon, each new mail announcing, if a little diffidently, that said Seamus Scanlon has just won another short story competition.

On route to the scene of Phelps's first case, while I admired Team Bondi's rendition of 1947 Los Angeles, my attention was interrupted by an announcement over the police dispatch. Apparently, there was a 401k going down on Hold-em-up Boulevard and an R-Type response was needed. Hm. A prompt appeared: "To answer the dispatch, press A." These, I realised, must be L.A. Noire's side-quests, and I instinctively moved to press A. But hold on, Phelps was on his first case as detective; he'd worked hard to get promoted from patrolman; this dispatch was not his duty to answer. I ignored the call. Each time another of these calls went out, I thought about it and didn't respond.
How about a book at an event?
One Islamist panelist added that progress in men’s views of women is not tied to the secularization of society but around human development. Considering the resilience of certain, patriarchal views of women in Western societies, we may have to agree with her.

Inside the Sagrada Familia, one senses Gaudi’s religiosity most profoundly. While his work remains unfinished to this day, this genius spent over 40 years on the Sagrada Familia until his tragic death in 1926. From a well-groomed “man-about-town” given to gourmet tastes, Gaudi’s last few years were marked by frugality. When he was accidentally hit by a tram while crossing a street and lost consciousness, he was mistaken for a beggar and was not given immediate medical attention. Such a sad ending for a man whose works now give Barcelona unparalleled pride.

I also found this gorgeous gray cotton flannel that may have a little rayon in it. It has a real retro feel and would be perfect for Negroni, don't you think? I picked up dark gray topstitching thread too.
I have so many exciting news to tell you guys but first important updates :)
If the massacre was retaliation for the murder of a cop’s son, it also explains why the police investigation went nowhere. In fact, investigators seemed to ignore one witness who described the man at the wheel of the getaway car as missing a finger; White was missing two fingers from his right hand. Recently uncovered FBI documents also reveal that White was an FBI informant, giving them reason to ignore leads pointing his way.
The grandmother is just as responsible – irresponsible – and should be held accountable. Fertility treatment was not intended for a 33 y/o mother with six children no matter her means.

The funniest thing about this clip is that I’ve seen so many videos of him messing up onstage—forgetting to introduce people, tripping, introducing the wrong song, singing the wrong lyrics, losing his microphone while lip-synching, and of course the false note at Live Aid, when he sounded like he’d been kicked where it counts. And the one time he had a legitimate excuse to mess up, he just keeps on moving and singing like nothing out of the ordinary is happening!

As we get towards the end of the season we often see teams start to get relaxed with the usual secrecy in the pitlane. This weekend in Korea was no different with several technical details being bared to the cameras for the first time.
You would expect me to be interested in this area, coming as I do from that most disjointed area of legal practice known as eDisclosure or eDiscovery, where all the elements of what should be a seamless process fall into discrete silos both within the clients and between the clients and their lawyers – and that is before they start interacting with opponents and the court. Do the lawyers just sit in the middle waiting to be pushed from one end by the client and from the other by the courts and regulators? That is not a rhetorical question and the answer, on the whole, is that yes, they do.
They've gone to seed.
The various elements will range in scale from private households to large power plants:
...slow food, traditional food, hand-prepared food, nourishing food...food that is NOT processed....food that doesn't come from a package...food that your great-grandmother would have made &/or eaten. REAL food is homemade. REAL food is from scratch. REAL food has recognizable ingredients. REAL food is made from traditional ingredients. REAL food is food you make with your own hands...from food grown, milled, raised by you or by people (not machines). Think family farmer. Think farmer's market. Think garden. Think local grain mill. Think REAL.

Real love - with all its fuck ups and messes and pain - is something that you should show and celebrate when it feels right, or when the object of your affection needs to be reminded. Not when other people tell you that you must. Not how other people tell you that you have to.
It's probably best to just risk the odd suicide-bombing and be done with it. After all, if Lord Ahmed lost his place on the multicultural gravy train, who'd employ him? An ex-convict of 51 years old - maybe it's time for some new anti-discrimination legislation?

Seeing the photograph on Youtube somewhat lessens the blow, so to feel full brunt of the tune's sheer mediocrity I suggest that you avert your eyes from the picture and instead imagine yourself strolling through aisles of clothing looking for something that even vaguely resembles the clothes in the newspaper insert that brought you to a big box department store in the first place.

On the bar were 5 beers, GK IPA, Taylor's Landlord, something else, and Abbeydale Moonshine and Absolution. I decided it was probably a little early at 1PM for an Absolution so opted for Moonshine. This was a well kept pint which I enjoyed sitting secluded in the right hand corner of the pub near the back entrance. Saturday really wanted to be warm and sunny, and the sunlight streaming in across my table kept urging me outside, but I remained where I was, appreciating another of the pubs many nooks and crannies.

Perry (the periwinkle gummi bear) had a strange smile affixed on his little gummi face, I’m just sure of it… and I knew at that moment that I couldn’t hold out any longer.

He has empathy. He’s not solely motivated by his own needs or survival. Maybe that sounds like a no-brainer, but our human tendency is to default into “Hey, pay attention to why my life sucks!” When was the last time you saw a Facebook status of “How was your day?”

Today I wanted to share an awesome canvas idea that you can make for your little ones or as a gift. My little girl is about to turn 1! Yep time goes by too fast right?!?! In getting everything ready for her party, I wanted to make a little something that I can place on the table where the cakes and cupcakes will be. The idea of a canvas with pictures of her popped into my mind and so I decided I would make one.
No sign is more passionate than intense Scorpio, and when mixed with the increased emotions of a full Moon, you can expect to feel strongly about everything! What did you set in motion at the new Moon on April 21? Now is the time to step back and see what you should retain … and what you should release. With Jupiter joining the Sun, as well as a pair of trines occurring (Venus to Saturn and Mars to Pluto), you’ll get plenty of help.

I didn't participate in 48 hour book challenge this weekend. I discovered it while dipping into the Twitterverse this afternoon. What a great way to kick off summer reading! Search the hashtag #48HBC to see what folks were reading and tweeting. I enjoyed dipping into the book blogs. As Jen Robinson's blog shows, the $48HBC is about much more than reading: reviewing, connecting, discussion. What a community! Sarah's blog got me wondering how much time I'd actually spent reading this weekend, so I set out to write up my own reading weekend stats. Wouldn't this be a neat thing to do with students next year? Anyone want to try it? I wonder if my high school students would be up for it at the end of the school year? Or if this would be a good weekend after exams kick off? I'll have to think about that.
I was a little jealous I have to say. I mean although I've no doubt my cupcakes look lovely, these were just beautiful.
The "shadow of the unmoving Sphinx" phrase troubles me a bit here. The logic of the lyrics suggests that the Sphinx's shadow only bothers the closed-hearted, but why the Sphinx? The fixity of the Sphinx is emphasized in "unmoving" but what is it about the Sphinx that bothers the closed-hearted so? Perhaps it's not the Sphinx itself, but what the Sphinx represents. In this case, perhaps it is the central truth of the Sphinx's riddle, solved so long ago by Oedipus (ah, that's the ticket. Our boy Kafka gets his own Oedipean curse), that human life is characterized by change, from infancy, to adulthood, to old-age. Those that are "closed" perhaps are haunted by this simple truth; that change is inevitable, that power, comfort, and knowledge are all conditional.
To become an architect, there is definitely a rigorous and long process one must follow, no doubt about it. I’ve especially noticed there also seems to be a traditional (standard) path that is religiously preached by educational institutions and architects that you must follow, or else fail:
There’s a marked southern influence that breeds a certain graciousness; it’s not surprising that America’s greatest songwriter, Stephen Foster, spent formative years in Cincinnati, though one would have to surmise that he made the occasional short trip across the Ohio River to Kentucky where booze, tobacco and other delights have always been easy, if not entirely free.
Myself & my colleagues went to roam around the village on a fine Sunday morning, being new to that place….asusual we just look around the places nearby. Some houses, many dogs, few people on the road, the whole atmosphere remembers the…typical Indian villages.

And with this I wish everyone an awesome twosome, threesome, plenty-some weekend (or a lonesome one, if you prefer).
One of those Robber Barons was Jay Cooke, of the Northern Pacific Railway. Railroads were the high tech of the day, unbelievably hungry for capital. Leveraged to the hilt, the company failed to get loan guarantees for $300 Million from the US Government (worth perhaps $30 Billion today), and collapsed. The collapse took down other Railroad companies, and then spread in a chain reaction that threw the United States into the longest Depression in its history.

More importantly, this is exactly the sort of pointless spending that every politician says he’s going to cut during his campaign. Anthropogenic global warming has been proven to be a fraud. Everybody knows the jig is up. That would naturally mean that a fund devoted to stopping global warming-again, a faked up pile of nonsense-should be done away with post haste.

We had a lovely time at the folk festival - catching up with friends some of whom we haven't seen since last year, hearing some great music, and on my part joining in some good singing sessions. Some of the overseas performers we saw were 'Dry Bones' from Manitoba, Canada, and Riley Baugaus and Kurt Sutphin from North Carolina, as well as local performers. There were other great performers from overseas and within Australia too.....deciding which ones to see was a difficult decision! Some pics were taken, but they won't be shown because I don't have the permission of the people in the pics to do so.

If you know your HTC phones, the resemblance between the One V and the HTC Legend (and, in turn, the Hero) will not go unnoticed. The trademark “chin” makes a strong comeback. Then, as now, HTC are targeting an audience that seek a phone, which makes a statement more than anything else, and with a slim 9.2mm profile and streamlined design, the One V does just that.

Also, I was not told I had extremely dense breasts for many years until the cancer radiologist explained how the tumor was hidden in the dense breast tissue on all the mammograms. My oncologist was not the leader of my nutrition support plan with appropriate supplements; that was not her focus or expertise and she did not seem interested in that area, so I learned I had to take charge of that myself. I credit my integrative doctors, especially my brother, with my success through chemo without side effects.
We were all in agreement on this.
Now for the headlines. The 2013 Focus ST sports a turbocharged 2.0L EcoBoost engine with 252HP and 270 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a six-speed manual transmission it sounds like a pretty potent package.

Satire allows opportunities for creative verbal and formal gyrations that transform aggression into a social and artistic expression that satisfies peoples’ needs for play and humour. Satire then is in part an expression of playful aggression, a sportive assault.

I discovered that some of the changes I made to the story – like losing a character – made little difference although I thought it would have a major impact. Other times, I would change one word or some punctuation and the story would improve markedly. I learned a lot about experimenting with the text.
April includes a trip to Maryland to see my very best high school bud, Sandra. For a baby shower no less.

My husband is the primary bread eater around here, and eats it either as breakfast toast or an accompaniment to dinner. Since he has never been a fan of rye toast I decided to make this bread as dinner rolls. I had visions of cunningly twisted knots of light and dark dough baking into high-contrast, visually appealing (delicious, of course) puffy rolls.
Right now, this movie is the be-all, end-all for my students. Many of them have seen it. (I don't necessarily agree with that, but...) And all they talk about are the "killing parts". I am a firm believer in movies as a support to texts, not in place of them. Sometimes the message is lost in search of clever movie ideas. In reading the text, I can discuss, and focus, on the parts of the story that are relevant and important. For example, the oppression of the poor. I teach in a Title 1 school, so many quarters can relate to the "poor" message. They didn't "get" that from the movie. My hope is to have them think of the text and change their conversations. They are so desensitized to violence that they miss the point. This is my chance to talk about the story, not the gore. I am also able to introduce new, unique vocabulary, etc. We will spend the rest of the school year on it. All parents signed the permission slip and many bought their children copies of the book. As I told one parent, as an educator, I don't feel that it is my right to censor literature (as in not allowing them to read things they are interested in.) However, it is the parent's right to do so. And if that means the child cannot participate in the story, I have alternative materials for them. They are not ostracized or put out.

This was not a national disaster but a disaster for the 29 workers who died in the mine explosion on November 19, 2010, and their families. PM Key’s class of banksters and profiteers are facing a financial hit but hardly a disaster. They are using the same approach to the failure of this mine as the failure of South Canterbury Finance. Inside traders get paid in full by the state for investing in a state bailout. The banksters get away with murder while posing as national leaders in national disasters. There is only one national disaster and that’s the NACT frontier capitalist neo-colonial lackey regime that serves the interests of Australian, US and Chinese imperialism!

As a parent (not only do I have my little man these days, but we also have a beautifully and wonderfully made 13 year old in our home), I understand this concept more and more fully. I know that when I tell Micah, “not for babies” and I use a stern voice tone he is going to look at me and push his bottom lip out and then cry a little and I am going to have to kiss him and give him something that is for babies because that is what is best for him. He doesn’t know it yet, but touching the hot oven rack will hurt him and my guidelines for his life are truly for his good. In the same vein, when I tell our 13 year old that she cannot go to Taco Bell without an adult, I know that she is going to be disappointed and not understand, but I also know that my guidelines are for her own good. If she were to go by herself, she could get abducted (and I don’t even want to think of what would happen after that), or something else could happen that could be prevented if she were with a responsible adult. I am willing to deal with the pouty lip from Micah and the silent treatment from the teenager because I love them that much. My hope is that one day my children will love their children enough to have these guidelines as well. That will tell me that they understand and that they no longer view those guidelines as restrictive but have matured and know that those guidelines were for their own good. And in the example of Micah, my hope is that when he is an adult and can freely touch the hot oven rack, he will decide not to because he knows it isn’t going to be good for him.

The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine. Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort: and in secret I have spoken nothing. Why do you ask me? Ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them. Behold they know what things I have said. And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing by gave Jesus a blow, saying: Do you answer the high priest so? Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why do you strike me? And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest.

Eric, my youngest, breaks my heart a little. Since he has Down syndrome, he is unable to speak to me on the phone. We see each other on Skype but mostly he performs for me then and is silly; we don’t have deep philosophical conversations the way the others and I do and I can’t really know how he is. He speaks a little but is difficult to understand. Our communication had always been intuitive, on a heart level. I so wish I could see him more. I miss his hugs. Nathaniel and Serena look out for him and have taken over most of his care. Everyone agrees that he seems happy. I don’t know yet what his future looks like.

This unwillingness to try something new that would save her time in the present and could potentially be useful to her in the future. This made me think long and hard about information literacy and an open mind. We talk about resource evaluation and computer literacy and social software, but in the end an open mind is the most important thing we can cultivate in our students. Without the willingness to question, experiment, and adapt, our students will not be able to apply information literacy skills outside of the assignments we give them. When I revise my teaching philosophy for my e-portfolio, I will include my ideas on how to promote this openness in the classroom.

It is somewhat fascinating. Everything in the area looked remarkably modernized. A fully functioning public transportation system (the primary oddity being the busses having a conductor instead of your typical fare box towards the front), shiny and towering buildings, modern vehicles (a lot of the cars being sold there look like last-gen vehicles with new-gen styling cues tacked on such as the local version of the Hyundai Elantra or their special Toyota Corolla EX), and all the comforts you’d expect from a modern, 21st century big city are all present in Shenzhen. But, falling in line with my father’s analogy, it seems the people are still growing into their new environment.
This article just goes to show how unprepared they are and I am thankful for that 21% who are at least a step ahead by making the connection.

Now less than two weeks away I have your 1st birthday coming up and how I cant believe your going to be one.

I long to hold you in my arms everyday how I would love to hold even just for one more min.
He says that since these never happened during his days with “Seotaeji and Boys“, he found it hard to handle. But what happened already happened and he had to quickly admit that and get over it. As YG said himself, he both disciplined and supported BIGBANG like a parent or an uncle, rather than an older brother, and that’s why he feels the most guilt towards BIGBANG.”

This painting was posted on Facebook by my friend Kelly M., who had a wonderful tropical vacation recently. It is my contribution to the Girls Just Wanna Paint Challenge - Beach Day. I was entranced by the yellow umbrella against the blue sky.... I altered the chair(s) under it and put a figure in to change it up a bit.
Usually, though, it's more along the lines of an Entourage or that short-lived TV show with Jay Mohr: a genial self-roasting (which is to say, self-tribute) that takes those dim-bulb actors and barbed-wire power agents into a headlock merely to give 'em a noogie and set 'em loose. Your average film-world power player is far too in love with the line of supplicants he has to step over just to cross the studio lot — daily ego balm for a nerdy schmuck who's likely spent half his life thoroughly ignored. Hand him the satirical blade behind yet another "exposé" of the princess that changed him from a lowly frog and gave him that cushy corner office, and he won't do much more than administer paper cuts.
And since this particular Verizon store is RIGHT next to the mall, we swung by to grab me a screen protector. I knew that the ones at Bassett were only $5. They couldn't be that much more at Sunland Park, right? Wrong! $12.99. Yeah, I think not!
Meanwhile, as Jenny and company get stranded in their boat and are stuck on one side of the island, three hikers or backpackers or whatever they're supposed to be are ion the other side, also looking for the disappeared/dead scientists. Why? Don't ask. They find a cave, stupidly wander in and find an old dusty book that has printed on the cover in big bold letters "The Book of the Dead", even though they call it "The Book of Death". Why? Don't ask. Being idiots, they read from the book and cause the pajama zombies to appear again, and they are eaten except for the guy with them that has the most open shirt and sweaty, overly-chiseled abs. Guess he was too oily to hold on to. This guy, Chuck (Jeff Stryker), runs all the way across the island to catch up with the rest of the cast, and all the zombie catch up with them and then it turns into one of those fights where if one isn't shooting, the other is biting.
All of this, sadly, has left our little family kind of lonely. Well maybe not so much lonely as sick of each other and in search of someone else with whom to talk and spend time. We live in a family-friendly neighborhood and, at least based on demographic information and the posts to the local mommy listserv to which I belong, the place is crawling with kids. How to meet them is a different matter. I remember when I first brought home my dog, Oscar, feeling like the neighborhood opened up to me; constant puppy potty breaks tend to reveal all manner of early birds, night owls, bar crawlers, church goers, athletic types, and fellow pet owners. Unfortunately, outside dog-walking, much of the daily pattern of urban family life seems to remain more indoors than out. Sure, I can tell you what time the mom down the street arrives home with her youngest child in tow, but they disappear so quickly into the confines of their rowhouse that I’m left wondering if it was really just a mirage, a figment of my imagination brought on by the desperate need for companionship.
She stops at the tree we named Rilke. It grows through a sidewalk cutout protected by a wrought-iron guard. Smaller than the others on the street, it has survived without thriving for a long time. She grips the dormant trunk strongly with both hands, like the shoulders of a child she needs to make listen.

My dear sisters, I believe that you, like our priesthood brethren, have been “called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of … exceeding faith and good works, … having chosen good.” Therefore you are “called with a holy calling.” (Alma 13:3.)
My stories didn’t sell but they convinced me, back in London, to take a break from writing and join a small n.g.o. promoting traditional music from non-western cultures and had the great privilege of working with artists like Youssou N Dour and Omara Portuondo on their first visits to London, as well as street bands from Kenya, a whore-house singer from the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and several incredible griots from West Africa. The best concerts, not surprisingly, were ones in which the Senegalese or Syrian or Colombian communities came out in force and lapped up the music from their homes. The musicians responded to their nostalgia with a creative generosity that was contagious.

I remember the nervousness of handing my 6 year old over to the older dancers—all of maybe 14 or 15—while they finalized their “lineup” and parents decided who would be announcing and also running the music. The procedure became routine as we danced over the years at parades, churches, grocery stores, fundraisers, restaurants, weddings, private parties, taverns, malls, libraries.
When I first set out to craft an engaging story, my mind didn’t automatically jump to the Zombie genre. At the moment, it’s a bandwagon full of offerings with fans joining the ranks in exponential numbers. Zombies are popular at the moment; there is no doubt about it. The difference with Days with the Undead is that in the beginning I started out to write a story about survival. The perfect backdrop for that story just happened to be a Zombie Apocalypse and I’m not going to lie, the genre is one of my favourites.
In his letter, Acosta writes about his colleague, Norma Gonzales, and her experiences over the last few days. In addition to teaching literature at the high school level, Gonzales worked with elementary school teachers in TUSD, helping them bring Mexican American content into their teaching. She also did art projects with students at Wakefield Middle School.

When, think you, were fashioned the pillars of that colossal character? Did they spring up to meet the emergencies of fame and power? No! they were sculptured in the sacred quarry of the cradle with that chisel which only a mother’s hand can wield. When we stand in the presence of art’s grandest achievements we feel like bowing before that genius which can take from the hand of nature a block of marble and hew away the chips that hide a waiting angel. But the mother of Garfield took from the hand of God the unformed elements of a human character and shaped them into something it were blasphemy to compare with the proudest creation that ever leaped from the brain of genius a God-like man.

The third reason also gave me the tools I needed to set it up.

Advice: You may be in more instant and constant communion with Spirit now and the sensation may therefore be altered. You will adapt to this new feeling. You are actually thinking and acting in partnership with Spirit most of the time now. You may find your meditation periods shorter.
Sometimes when difficult things happen with out warning in our lives , we tend to think ” what’s the point ” Those with a religious bent might see it as divine retribution or a Karmic slap up the side of the head . I sometimes wonder if these times that make us cry, make our hearts ache are not gifts to open us up to the geneousity of people who would otherwise be reticent about sharing feelings.

The rest, as they say, is history. George W. Bush, Republican of Texas, wasted hardly a waking hour after that storied 'Mission Accomplished' speech to crow about Iraq, coupling it with 9/11 so many times that to this day there are a few people who think Iraq had something to do with that event.

Faith must have been with me this week because this month’s Delicious. was all about Chinese food (read; noodles!). Yay! Unfortunately Chinese cuisine does not include a lot of vegetarian dishes and neither did the Delicious. Resourceful as I am, I mixed up a few different recipes and created Chinese Vegetarian Noodles. And they were pretty OK… I guess.

Their own label, brewed at an unknown location, includes some really great-looking beers, Indra, a Weizen India Pale Ale, Roog, a smoked Weizen and Darkon, a Schwarzbier, all relatively reasonably priced, while still oozing exclusivity due to the classy packaging (thanks to a friend, I tried all three of these two nights ago, but I’ll return to those in a later post). But I balk at paying €17.99 for a 330ml bottle of 13% Arrique barley wine (€54 per litre)! I mean, made with local ingredients, how can it be that expensive? That’s where style and exclusivity can stay out in the cold.

Aside from the bogus aforementioned ‘hockey stick’ method of graphing, there is only one raw data set that shows numbers that appear in the NASA graph and the Bradley picture. That dataset is from the weather station atop Mauna Loa Volcano in Hawaii. data is controversial because it always shows the very highest amount of CO2 in the atmosphere of any data set. Why? First, it sits atop an active volcano that constantly spews CO2. Second, Hawaii is a small land mass that sits in a very hot part of the world which is surrounded by the ocean. The warmer it gets the more the ocean releases its CO2 (think of the ocean like a giant CO2 sponge.) Not exactly the most objective choice to measure “global” CO2 to be sure.

Keeping supplies at home that are familiar to children who are going to school can enhance their education by encouraging them to learn even while not in the classroom. Simple books and posters can create an environment that triggers thinking. Even if a child does not know what a particular supply or tool does, having access to it can draw them closer to a level of understanding that will serve them well in class.

So it was that I stood on Yawkey Way several summers ago, strolling around the exterior of the park taking pictures of the championship banners here, the Ted Williams statue there. So engrossed was I in forever capturing these indelible features on film that I only noticed too late that my wallet was gone. Spinning around, I tried to retrace my steps, but couldn’t figure out how I had lost it. Then it hit me: that damn extreme Dutch angle. In my thirst for the most memorable of shots, I had laid on my back on the pavement in the hopes of shooting those numerous banners from a perspective that would make future viewers question just what it was they were seeing. In pursuing the shot, I had removed my wallet so that I could lie completely flat. And

Most parents innately want to comfort their children though sad times or sickness. To do so requires a parent who is willing to give that gift, and a child who is willing to receive it. Yet so many adults are unable to be comforted themselves; they often subjugate their own needs and problems in an effort to offer themselves as a comforter to children, partners, family and friends. When a parent puts their own need for comfort at the bottom of the list, they are portraying themselves as superhuman or as martyrs, whose comfort is either unimportant or undeserved. When parents do that, their children learn to subjugate the importance of their own comfort in order to comfort others. While this is noble in some respects, it can also lead to the child questioning their own value as they get older, as they lose the ability to seek and accept comfort when they need it. This can lead to feelings of isolation or uncertainty in times of need.
In all three areas, scientists expected that the data would be consistent with atheism. First, scientists expected that life could exist even if the physical constants and ratios were altered. The progress of science said NO. Second, scientists expected that the universe would be eternal. The progress of science said NO. Third, scientists expected that the origin of life would be simple. The progress of science said NO. Why do some people resist the progress of science and cling to the religious dogma of materialism?

As time passed and the park opened at 9am, the place got packed. Wall-to-wall people. The shops are all tiny inside and it was impossible to move around. We never did get to go in Olivander’s wand shop; the line to get in was 30 people deep when we got there just after 8. You could also buy wands at a cart outside the store, but apparently it is more fun in the store.

But, alcoholism, addiction, and PTSD are all very treatable. People do get better and go on to live healthy, productive, lives. Some people go beyond getting better. They move on to become authentic. That brings me to my favored personality development theory, Dabrowski’s Theory of Positive Disintegration. As much as I like Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, Dabrowski rings far more true for me. Loathe as I am to use Wikipedia as a source, for this topic, I am going to do it. So, go here and read this: Positive Disintegration. It’s not an easy or a quick read, but it is extremely worthwhile. The theory is far too complex for me to give you a nutshell description here.
I've been sewing in here every day since! It is so nice. I've also been a good girl, and cleaned up my mess each time I finish, so that I can keep the room looking good. Next I plan to have a friend come over and help me go through my fabric stash. I'm pretty sure I like and want everything that I have, but I would like another set of eyes, and I don't want to keep anything I don't have a plan for. Right now I have a few things in a Facebook album that I'm offering for sale or trade.
Like many other changes in the newspaper world, the advent of hubs has been greeted by both bitterness and hope. The entire point is to consolidate editing and design to be more cost-effective, with more emphasis placed on reporters’ abilities to turn in relatively clean copy that doesn’t require much reworking. This consolidation equals taking copy and design desks out of newsrooms, a move that several large media companies including Gannett, Media General and Tribune have been steadily pushing.
We've dishonored our dead and whitewashed our enemies. A distinctly unholy alliance between fanatical Islamists abroad and a politically correct "elite" in the US has reduced 9/11 to the status of a non-event, a day for politicians to preen about how little they've done.

Last weekend Avery and I did get to go see Alice in Wonderland and it was fantastic. The 3-D made it so much fun. It was whimsical and oh so cute! I would enjoy seeing it again. Sunday night we went to another Christian concert, as Mark had won tickets. We saw Toby Mac and Brandon Heath. It was a great concert and I drove back to Atlanta Monday morning. All I feel like doing is sleeping for a while. I know that sounds so non-productive, but I am being very honest with you folks. I'm tired and I'm of the school that says, "Sleep is good for you" I have had friends and relatives that think it's horrible to nap and that you should jump up early in the morning even if there's nothing pressing. I function better with sleep.

The group was trying to use a RushCard Visa card to make the sizable purchase at Look at Me Now Urban Wear on 17th Street. When the transaction could not be processed as a debit, it was also attempted as a credit. When that also failed the female suspect pretended to call the bank, and the alleged bank representative gave the clerk permission to run the card “offline.” The clerk then recalled a scam alert that detailed a similar crime and stalled the suspects until deputies arrived. Responding deputies found two men in a waiting vehicle, one at the store entrance and two inside. They also determined that the person pretending to be the bank official was actually one of the men in the car.
One of my favorite genres to run for RPGs, I find that the Pulp genre is also one of the easiest to run. Because RPGs tend to be rather spanning and sometimes random, the loose conventions of Pulp allow a GM to run a game in the same way. It really is a mad lib sort of genre where just about everything that you can think of can happen.

In her early twenties, Bessie moved to Chicago. Perhaps there she could "find a bigger life." In the city, Bessie heard many tales of World War I from returned veterans. She also heard there were woman airplane pilots in France. From then on, she was determined to become a pilot. But she soon found out that no one would teach a woman -- especially a woman with dark skin -- how to fly. To study in France was her only chance, and by working hard and saving her money, she managed at last to get there. Bessie Coleman became the first African-American to earn a pilot's license. She was somebody.

The Hyena and Other Men. These photos are mind-blowing. Photographer Pieter Hugo became interested in a group of Nigerian men who capture hyenas and then keep muzzled on huge chains. Why? Not really sure. My best guess is because these animals are TERRIFYING to look at. These photos are astonishing. I also recently learned that hyenas are not from the canid family; rather, they are more closely related to cats. So bizarre. (Pieter Hugo)

They were both fitted last week for their braces and did great during their appointment. Although painless, in order to make their braces, they have to have molds made of their little legs . Kylee was NOT A FAN during her last casting, so I was a bit nervous at how they’d do this time. It was nice this time around, being able to explain what would happen before we got there. I had showed Kylee and Brody pictures from when Kylee was little and told them “yay, you get to get braces!”…which of course led Korbin & Miss B wondering why they don’t get to have braces…ugh, can’t win! Anyways, I told them both that Mr. Spencer was going to put mud on their legs and it was going to be SO SILLY!

Cesare says the dove’s a symbol of the uncorrupted soul, and ironically, it’s being made to carry messages of corruption.

On January 26th, an online community post titled, ‘Junyung & Goo Hara with couple bracelets‘ caused a flood of commentary, as many netizens drew the connection between the bracelets and the two’s acknowledgement of their relationship last year.
I have seen people who can extend extraordinary compassion and respect for their own children, but are unable or unwilling to do the same for their partner. I see people who can ask deep, sincere questions and seek to understand what a child is feeling, yet judge the behavior of teenager or young adult in the blink of an eye with no questions asked. And I see people who will sit on the floor for hours engrossed in play with a toddler who then change on a dime when their kids hit school age. Of course, the converse is also often true: people who can let their partners "be who they are" while trying to mold their child's behavior, people who can give an adult a break because they have had a bad day but still demand and require perfect performance from their kids regardless of the day the child has had. It's interesting, to say the least.
