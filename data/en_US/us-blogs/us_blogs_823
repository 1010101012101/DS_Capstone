Each step of a sustainable coffee agriculture system has resource (waste) products that can be put back into the system. By the time the green coffee beans have made it to the US, there are still many resource products urban gardeners can glean from the final coffee roasting process. Coffee bags, chaff (bean hull) and used coffee grounds are a gardeners ultimate free resource. Today I will focus on the many uses for the jute coffee bags. I encourage you to seek out your local coffee resources and support a system that gives back to farmers and the earth. Here in Minneapolis we have a thriving coffee culture and numerous local roasters. I source my bags from an amazing company, Peace Coffee, that takes coffee sustainability seriously – as they say themselves “a cultural, social and consumable revolution with grounds firmly mixed in, a farmer friendly fair trade reality”.

Well, firstly on a very practical level it gave me the time to really concentrate on writing. I’d gone from being a student into full time work, so when I was on my maternity leave it was my first real chance to really clear my head and start to pull together my ideas. I also think that when I was working I was very bound up in being a probation officer and the stresses of the job, so maternity leave gave me some distance and perspective. Motherhood is a very strong theme in both The Woman Before Me and The Sacrificial Man and having children myself meant that I cared even more about this very vital relationship. In my work I had seen how devastating it can be to have an abusive or absent mother, and it was natural for me to connect with this theme when I came to explain how Rose and Alice came to be the women they are.
I wont get into the history of brooms and witches or even how to use them in a ritual, this is just a little aside about the sweeping you do in your home. The act of sweeping is cleaning and cleansing. You are literally sweeping away the debris of the day and you can use the same time to sweep away other debris.

If designing your own project seems to be a bit complicated for your current level of expertise, it's certainly something we can all aspire to. Remember that Peri has been an artist for some time and while her methods may appear to be too complex for us, everyone has to start somewhere. There are always books and videos to get you started on designing your own needlework. Start small and you just may find that it's something that you want to learn more about.
We also said goodbye to two of our friends who moved to Den Haag. These guys warmed our hearts with their generosity, whilst inspiring us at the same time with their continuing success in their lives.

My children stim. I stim--come on, for Pete's sake--every one of us--autistic or not-- STIMS. We all engage in self-regulatory behaviors to calm ourselves. Some of us have small, discrete behaviors that are not necessarily obvious. I swing one of my feet beneath my desk at work. I rub my thumb over my index finger repeatedly. My fingers slide back and forth over the steering wheel while I drive. They're small stims. But they are there, and they are used to regulate myself.
A covered entrance to the home welcomes you where you can turn left to bedroom office areas or turn right to the master bedroom or the two spacious living areas. The house is built to encapsulate the view of wide rolling countryside whether inside or out. Living areas are of generous proportions with bifold doors opening out to elevated patio area, ideal for BBQs and a discretely placed log burner is just perfect for warming those winter days while sitting back and enjoying the view.
We suggest that the increasing availability of information and support for transgender individuals (e.g., growth of the internet) has been a major influence in such shifts. In addition, transgender mental health professionals have made efforts to reduce the barriers imposed by the screening process that occurs prior transition and to make this process more client focused.
James Dean is often knocked for attempting to emulate Marlon Brando by hopping on the motorcycle bandwagon– but that’s just not true. Dean had ben riding since he was a kid back in Indiana farm country. His first bike was a Czech built CZ (ceska zbrojowka or Czechoslovakian weapon factory in English). In 1948 the first series of CZ 350 cc’s appeared in the frame used by the 250 cc. The motor had flat pistons, reverse flow and a capacity of 358 cc. The top speed was underwhelming by today’s standards– 65 mph. When he later bought a new Triumph, Dean sold this bike back to the dealer.
One thing that stood out to all of us is that each of the students who visited us, all seniors, had really solid plans for life after high school that covered the broad range of options available to young people that included college and much more. This indicated to us that these students have been provided the opportunity and support to explore all of their options and make the best decision for themselves based on their goals and interests. We are curious: What do you do to help students prepare for life after The MET?

Many New Yorkers are sending their kids to McGill, and I’m always touting my alma mater, the University of Toronto — tuition for non-Canadians is still much less than for comparable American colleges.
Here's what I don't get though. America has removed it's humanitarian aid (snack bars) to famine stricken North Korea because they are going ahead with the launch. How can it be humanitarian aid, if they are attaching political conditions to it? What kind of twisted morals are these, to say: "So we've been forced to suspend our activities to provide nutritional assistance to North Korea,". If North Korean civilians needed food aid enough to warrant Barry Obama making a big deal out of it in the first place, then they will still need it after their government launches the rocket. Just who are they trying to punish here? They are probably utilising the same morals they used when they imposed the international trade sanctions on North Korea, causing the problems in the first place.

When you watch a Keaton film you can always expect great comedy and great action. The comedy is split fairly evenly between broad physical humor and the subtler comedy of manners which arises from the way that Willie tries to finesse his situation so that he doesn't end up killed. The action comes fairly fast and furious, showcasing some truly amazing stunts by Keaton. In the climatic waterfall scene Keaton has to rescue Talmadge by swinging across the waterfall on a rope and catching her in midair as she goes over the fall. Being 1923, achieving the stunt involved actually doing it, making the scene endlessly impressive. The sense of danger is very real and the skill on the part of the crew, on-screen and off-screen, is apparent.

7. GASLIGHT (1944) at the Castro, as part of Noir City. Really, I could list all of Noir City here, but part of the fun is picking my favorite. For all the mental torture of Ingrid Bergman, for me I couldn't take my eyes of saucy little 19 year old Angela Lansbury. Something about finding out I'm attracted to Angela Lansbury makes this movie unforgettable.
The nice staff at the pool tell us that the complaint comes from a lady with a dog. It seems that if her little poodle isn’t allowed into the pool area then why should a goat be? Well little vegetarian goat droppings are very different to dog shit. People are odd complaining about someone else’s happiness. When we take Gary out of the pool area, a little girl cries because she wanted to pat Gary some more.
I would like for those of you who worked closely with John in one capacity or another, to help me, over the next weeks and months, come up with ideas for the best vessel (organization, university program, scholarship, foundation, prize, etc.) for furthering John's message going forward.

After England v Wales and Liverpool v Cardiff I think I need a lie down in a darkened room for quite a few days. My Auntie Mary, the gun-totin' fighting nun from the posh end of Fairwater "texted" me as they were visiting relatives and she said they were all crying in their beer.
For FOG. We established that there are 3 figures to a stand. Well, I´d like some stands with 3 but about half of them (or more) with only two figures. You can just put a 20x20mm base between the figures, and flock it like you would a regular base. This will unify the stand leaving the space in between empty. Or you can also create two 10x20mm “fillers” so every stand is actually different, and the skirmishing effect is even better.

Despite this, the main focus of this episode was on the assassins tracking Ace. Gus was smart in trying to keep Ace safe and had a lucky, if not slightly paranoid spot as they left the hotel. Interesting that because if the assassin had made his shot, he would have been out of there and on the plane home. The scene in the restaurant was clever, particularly the reference to an earlier time something similar had happened for Ace and Gus, and the immediate acting out a phone call, come argument. This led the assassin to what he thought was following Ace into the bathroom, only to instead be jumped by Gus. Gus just about managed to kill him but gave a resigned look, presumably wondering why he was still doing that at his age. Unfortunate for the assassin that he had not gotten that earlier shot.

Taken as a whole, GOLDENEYE is a very good action movie with plenty of innovate action sequences (the opening bungee jump is still cool even if we’ve all realized that bungee jumping isn’t) and a cool-under-pressure Bond. Instead of feeling like a relic, GOLDENEYE feels confident and assured. Where some of the recent Bond movies have felt like they were trying to fit into their contemporary cinematic landscape, GOLDENEYE simply feels like they set out to make a good movie that’s aware of the political landscape but not beholden to whatever was popular in the theaters the year before.
I then used a large pan to scramble all the eggs at once. I like to add black pepper and garlic salt to my eggs. I also added about a 1/2 cup of water to the mixture to give the eggs a little more fluff. Continue to stir the eggs until they scramble and then remove from the heat.
There is talk around the web that SDN will spell the end for special network hardwar companies like Cisco as well as eliminate the jobs of network operators. While entirely possible, such an event is not going to happen overnight. Cisco is not likely to give up without a fight, and at this point it still has a chance to react and adapt to this new technology. The reduction in network operator IT positions is possible as well but this virtualization technology is going to open up its own field of study as well, which should lead to positions maintaining SDN. Especially while software defined networking is still a new technology, businesses are going to need their IT personnel.

Which is little surprise, because although many of the youths had committed only lesser offences — petty theft, minor assault — and ‘training sentences’ were indeterminate, stretching anything up to five years, until they were deemed ‘corrected’. But most youths did emerge fit, able and, thanks to the skills training, ready and eager to work.
However, having my ideas called “sophomoric” or being perceived as having an “intense loathing” of the Church makes me angry. In no way did I say I loathed the Church; if someone chooses to infer that from my words, go for it… but why ratchet up the dialogue like that?

But back to the story. It’s a slow romance, and while Posey is cute, she isn’t a hottie. And Liam doesn’t immediately see her as some beauty. This is a good thing! Instead, he likes her the way she is but the attraction isn’t instant. And nobody ever pretends that it is. Liam falls in love with Posey as a person rather than through lust first. What I loved so much was that the characters were different…not really quirky-different just very real.

Simple and elegant is really hard to do. All the reviews of the new Steve Jobs biography mention his insistence on clean, simple and intuitive.

The national planning policy framework encourages effective use of land by reusing land that has previously been developed (brownfield land). This must be seen as a massive boost to rural economies and infrastructure. However, as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive recast comes in to play from 2017 onwards, I would assume that we will see a huge increase in refurbishments of existing buildings. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive states that buildings performing below a certain level will not be suitable to let. What remains to be seen is whether new build or refurbishment of these existing buildings is a more viable solution. It will be down to the Local Authority to deem what is more sustainable.

This being Constable Country, the church is an appropriate home for The Ascension which hangs on the south wall, one of three religious works Constable painted for local churches. Continuing round the church to the west and the highly decorated 1843 organ, a small door inset into stonework graffiti’d with scratched initials from centuries past leads into the tower, a landmark often seen in Constable’s paintings. The tower itself is actually a separate structure (and access through the door is not permitted), so for a closer look I have to step outside. At 131 feet tall, it dominates the surrounding landscape, but one of its most impressive features can be found in the archway through the base, a so-called ‘Galilee porch’, in reference to Jesus leading his disciples into Galilee after the resurrection. Looking up, the stone ceiling is beautifully carved with tracery and heraldic symbols, Tudor roses and portcullises, an example of astonishing craftsmanship.

Google says parents are to blame if children view porn: Online giant attacks call for legal curbs Help us spy on Twitter: FBI asks companies to develop software for monitoring social media to predict crimes Don't be a Facebook spy! Bosses warned about snooping on staff via social networks The soon to be published Communications Capabilities Development Programme is expected to force internet service providers to store details of when and where emails are sent and by whom. Mr Omand wants a Green Paper to be published on monitoring social media sites and for private industry to link up with the Government to develop analytical tools to monitor developments. There have been reports to suggest that Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden are using social media to communicate with one another and Mr Omand said that in such circumstances the authorities need to be able to gain access to private accounts. Monitoring: Sir David Omand said criminals are increasingly making use of online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to communicate Monitoring: Mr Omand said criminals are increasingly making use of online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to communicate He added: ‘I don’t know anybody who thinks that it should be ring-fenced and allowed to become a secret space.’ A new report by the think-tank Demos indicates that Twitter and Facebook accounts could be legally accessed by using the Regulatory and Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). The act states that warrants are not necessary for ‘directed surveillance’ of a suspect – for example when monitoring a person’s movements – and that the principle could be extended to the internet where investigators were using publicly available information. However, the former director of GCHQ said it was essential that monitoring was put on a legal footing so that where individuals have put up privacy settings on their social network accounts any monitoring which involves the interception of communications should require a warrant. Networking: Mr Omand wants a Green Paper to be published on monitoring social media sites and for private industry to link up with the the public sector to develop analytical surveillance tools Networking: Mr Omand wants a Green Paper to be published on monitoring social media sites and for private industry to link up with the public sector to develop analytical surveillance tools The report states: ‘Democratic legitimacy demands that where new methods of intelligence gathering and use are to be introduced, they should be on a firm legal basis and rest on parliamentary and public understanding of what is involved, even if the operational details of the sources and methods used must sometimes remain secret. ‘People now share vastly more personal information about themselves, their friends and their networks in new a varied ways: what is ‘public’ and what is ‘private’ is not always obvious and differs greatly across social media platforms and even within social media platforms.’ The report’s publication comes against the background of intense controversy over the Government’s plans to extend the monitoring of all texts, telephone calls, emails and internet traffic in the UK. Sir David said that proper regulation was essential to ensure public trust in the system. ‘The problem with social media is that it doesn’t really fit the 19th and 20th century structures we have for how you go about regulating these matters,’ he said. ‘After Iraq, we must be sure that if people are engaged in this kind of monitoring, they are doing it for the reasons set out in the authorisation (and that) it has not been politicised.’ A Home Office spokesman said communications data has played a role in every major security service counter-terrorism operation over the past decade and in 95 per cent of all serious organised crime investigations. However, Google says that when it comes to accessing pornography online laws will not protect children - only parents can keep their children safe from such adult material.

Dear Rowan,
The entire life of Christ as He walked this earth was marked by His humility. He came as a servant. By His own words Jesus reveals His humility. Luke 22:27 (NASB) "For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as the one who serves.” Matthew 11:29 (NASB) "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart…” His teachings were clear that it was the one who is last that will be first in His kingdom. Matthew 20:26-29 (NASB)

After my last week's weigh-in, even though I loss 2.6 lbs, I feel as though it could of been more, since I've had weeks with bigger losses when I've exercised less and ate more. Vicky suggested after my last post that maybe my calorie deficit being 2500+ is just TOO much. And she had read my mind because I was thinking the same thing. Maybe I need to eat MORE? I went back and looked at my food diary and BodyMedia Fit stats for the week I had such a big loss of 5.8 lbs, and I did eat more, I was averaging more around 1000/cal a day versus the 600-900 I have been eating the past few weeks. So I am going to try it out next week. I am going to make a better effort to eat BETTER foods, and keep my calories around 1000-1100 and see what that brings me. It also is my TOM this upcoming week though, so I need to remember not to have TOO high of expectations.. (who am I kidding, I am ME, it's impossible to not let myself down..[sigh]).....

Although I enjoy all art forms, sculpture is the one the leaves me most baffled. I have heard it said that the best sculptors begin with a block of marble or wood or whatever, see the image they desire to create, and cut away what it not supposed to be there.
A few incarnations later, he learns that unless he's cared for by a dozen attendants and speaking daily at the ashram, he better keep the ego around, and he can balance all that in art. Within art you can bury all kinds of magnificent truths people aren't ready to hear any other way. We dismiss ideas that challenge our egos outright, but we'll always stop for a good movie, one that stealthily addresses ideas of madness and artistry and newly minted holy men wondering where they're supposed to go now that they're selfless in a selfish world they themselves have made. Where are the damned lepers in San Diego?
Alexander goes to meet Charles, who still isn’t looking so hot. He tells Alexander he’s still sick and thinks this battle may be his last. He’s not there to confess, though. He wants Alexander to use his diplomatic skills to end the battle before it starts. Alexander asks Charles to hand over all the booty he’s gathered during this invasion to the church, and then they can talk. Charles isn’t ready to play this game and tells Alexander that he just wants to lead his army back to France in peace. If they don’t let him do that, he promises to annihilate everyone around them and destroy Alexander as well. I can see why he’s not relying on his own diplomatic skills here. Alexander is uncowed and promises to deliver the message to the Italian forces. He pauses and listens to the thunder rumbling outside and wonders if the King of France can keep his cannon lit in the rain. He leaves, and Cesare, who’s been listening in, leaves too.
Not to mention the acting is the pits, the writing is dated and tired and the directing is all over the place – seriously, why did we even need the three different time periods? It’s not like any of them really added up to much, and what they did add up to was completely random and inconsequential, like two different people directed it.

Is it necessary to mention the one trait any tactical light really must have? It must be tough as nails.... all but bulletproof.... and all but idiot proof. Drop it, kick it, take it for a swim, and use it as a hood prop.... but it must work every time.
So, we see that one ultimate purpose of this creation as we survey the end from the beginning is that the devil and his angels would be born as men, would “end up” as those pre-ordained to this condemnation as wandering stars who left their first estate as fallen angels on the left of Jesus on Judgment Day so that they would be cast into the lake of fire in the bodies of mortal men as a whole at the Lord’s return.
Friday the 12th we see Dr. Popp again for our annual visit. I wonder if he plans on finally x-raying her. I know that he will be pleased to know that she exceeded expectations in her 18 month developmental check up at the pediatrician.
I'm writing about sea cucumbers. They look like a sort of tube, or a dog turd, or a fat caterpillar. They live in the sea and are an animal, despite the name. In particular, I'm writing about the way a sea cucumber can turn itself almost liquid, ooze through a crack, then solidify the other side so that it can't be prised out. Cool, eh?
I am not suggesting that we should never offer our ideas, or thoughts, or the wisdom of our own experiences. When we are engaged with our children, they will look to us to help them approach these challenges. But there is a difference between offering these things as a partner in your child's life, and controlling these things in an attempt to prevent your children from experiencing the difficulties of life. If we help our children approach their lives through a framework of what is possible when we learn and experience new things, they are far more likely to view these challenging times in ways that far exceed our hopes and expectations with their maturity and balance.
I raised 11 varieties of tomato from seed; not all of them survived and I wasn't great about marking which plan was which, so there's going to be a lot of trying to figure out what varieties of tomatoes worked and which ones didn't. Some of my seedlings are pretty robust looking and some are tiny. I'm hoping for the best. And I got some free seeds from some seed company marked simply "heirloom". Great. That's not descriptive at all. Why so many? J really likes salsa. I plan on salsifying most of these, come August and September. J remarked that we could probably have a really good tomato fight too. Exactly how much salsa does he want?
Crippled with curiosity, I click new tab and start googling. Despite the fact that I am gagging and dry heaving, and I have to take breaks, I watch the whole thing. I need to protect my honor.
In other more personal news, I have finally decided on a name for my film company, wait for it, On The Rocks Entertainment! To stay in touch with my filmmaking goodness you can check out my filmmaking blog (it’s hyperlinked dude). Aside from that, I have a question for you guys, how would you feel if I were to start making podcasts? Is that something you might be interested in? I think it would be awesome. Just me being my random self, doing all sorts of dumbassery. Lemme know in the comments below!

And let’s be honest. I might not understand the appeal of Chuck Norris, but he walks around with his shirt off quite a bit and he doesn’t look like a guy letting himself go. If he’s living on a diet of cheap beer and kicking bad guys teeth in, then I’d say it’s working.
Today, I will trust God’s will is always manifest in my experience. I no longer am anxious, or afraid or in fear of God’s will that I must live my L.I.F.E. by any other pattern than the one I design for myself, because Spirit lives in me and the pattern that I design was already co-created with Spirit. I celebrate now that I am always in the will of God in my experience in whatever I choose to do.

Now look at the 2010 census. The total population was 3,206,742, a 30% increase. Non Malaysian citizens shot up by 61% to 889,779 while Kadazan/Dusun only grew by 24% to 568,575.
I use a Canon EOS 40D. Canon has an Av setting (Nikon has A I believe) for aperture. So, put your camera in ‘creative mode’, the mode that lets you choose other settings than the ‘automatic’ ones and choose the Av or A setting (or whatever it is on your camera). You can now adjust the width of your lens opening and your camera will choose a shutter speed that allows enough light into the camera to get a well lit photo. I can do this by turning one of the wheels on my camera. Check your manual how to adjust it on your camera.

Ah, Paris… I had quite a few good reasons to set my story there:
Okay let me 'fess up. Remember the whole bullshit with The Moth? And remember how I had that bad case of the What Ifs? As in What If this performance gets me noticed? Well part of that prompted me to acquire many copies of some of my books, which I had intended to sell at the merch table. Now I have that back stock and I was thinking... (uh-oh, not that again). If I can sell these books to y'all, I can pay my mortgage this month and still have money left to feed Rebound the delicious wet food she so loves, so she can stop eating Dante's shit and then barfing it on my bed.

Remember me! I'm the new 2 year old. I don't know why people always talk about the Terrible Twos, when there are so many other t-words to describe me: tremendous, terrific, tender, ticklish, toddler, topnotch, troublemaker, tantrum-thrower, and tenacious. Hey, how did those last three descriptions get in there?!!!

Okay, I take it back. At my last job in the health care industry there was one woman in marketing that wore them all of the time. She was 70. She also made sure to match a purple colored lipstick to her purple colored suits. It was a nice touch.

Lastly and most importantly – REIKI SELF TREATMENTS!! … By doing regular self treatments, you align with your soul, higher self, and your emotional body. Through daily treatments, we begin to heal ourselves at our very core essence. This tells your psyche and your pain, “I LOVE MYSELF“. This is not a journey of fairy dust and ice cream. This is a healing journey meant to reconnect to your being, open you to peace, love and serenity, making the world a pleasant enjoyable place to experience vs. fearful mean or scary. Awakening the part of you that is pure love. Getting there isn’t always easy, the ego doesn’t want to let go of the drama.
so I took inspiration from the tree by adding a little chippie one and I also included the title in my layout and I tried to stick with the colours as well........I was happy with how this turned out...that's a photo of my beautiful Mum and I!!
Several of the books I’ve read in the last two months have animals as secondary characters. I’ve noticed that even authors who sometimes have difficulty creating well-rounded human characters can write wonderful pets. And authors who shine at characterization give us animals we’d like to take home and keep.

Here is a fun & simple little Spring Craft:
Generalized Fatigue/Adrenal Fatigue - I suppose this started when pregnant with my first child (back in 1995/1996). I was 18 years old and was amazed at how much of myself I lost during my pregnancy. Having a child is very taxing on a woman’s body, but when a woman doesn’t properly nourish herself, that loss is never made up for. I could see physical effects of my body loosing all those nutrients but had no idea that I was not properly putting them back in. I was eating everything I was supposed to, but I was still fighting a loosing battle. This goes for all my pregnancies. Lethargy and major lack of motivation has dominated my life in recent years, especially since my hysterectomy, leaving me pretty much bed-ridden most days. Whenever I was up and moving it wasn’t uncommon to see me constantly yawning and stretching. This has changed significantly since we started working with our nutritionist. She said I had severe adrenal fatigue and began working to heal my adrenal glands. I’m still fatigued but not nearly as much as before and I’m getting a lot more stuff done in every day. I’m even exercising regularly now!

On the issue of secondary school teachers, I remember having a heated discussion with a senior figure in Africa’s education scene round about the time the World Bank and the Commission of Higher Education had unimaginatively called for increasing the price of higher education in the country. I was then calling for increasing access to university education by adoption of Open Learning systems facilitated by the internet. The gentleman argued that increasing access was not the key issue. In his opinion, the poor quality of students emanating from primary and secondary schools was the crux of the problem and unless this is fixed, increasing the number of graduates leaving Kenyan universities would simply be a case of garbage in, garbage out. While concurring that the gentleman had some strong point to make, I should point out that I do not whole heartedly agree with the assessment with his analysis of secondary school products being of poor quality. The garage is rubbish but the car is a Mercedes. Kenyan students have potential; what is letting them down is the quality of the system and the trainers. What we need to do is fix or change the garage so that the true potential of the car can become self evident.
OK. How did you do??

“The internet has made such total control impossible,” is another denialist assertion – but the facts support the opposite view. Yesterday, Iran announced it will build its own internet and shut out all others. China already does this. Google and Verizon have already ensured that strata of ‘performance quality’ will soon be introduced onto the Web. The opportunity for censorship in that context is almost too obvious to point out. The Russians are miles ahead in the race to perfect ways of blagging into and if necessary jamming all forms of internet communication. Every last ISP selling telecoms online already works in cooperation with GCHQ. This isn’t conspiracy paranoia – read Jacqui Smith’s last statement to the House before her husband’s porn penchant brought her down: having first denied that such action in concert was under construction, she later reversed her position entirely.
I see many really talented people ( engineers, MBAs, specialists, generalists ) refusing to collaborate and thus limiting their own possibilities.
The Church requires you to attend confession at least once a year. However it is a good spiritual practice to go to confession more frequently, at least every month or so.
They haven't given me anything for free or anything but I'm still going to say I love appliances online. Cheap, fast, reliable, on time, helpful. Seriously, it's not often I can say that about a shopping experience. Anyway, the new dryer is rockin.
Yes….(sigh) I remember how Bristol gave birth to Levi’s child and missed out on all that teenage fun. (sigh) She had to endure the hardships of appearing on “Dancing With The Stars.” THEN…..day after day of speaking tours telling other teenagers how awful it was to be pregnant and have to raise a child. THEN…..the rigors of having to write a book about it all. All this because Levi couldn’t keep his ding-a-ling in his pants.

The two officers who were shot at the scene of the traffic stop were identified as Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40, who was killed, and Officer John Hege, 41. On Sunday, an Oakland police spokesman said that Mr. Hege had been pronounced brain dead but was still on life support pending a decision about organ donation, The Associated Press reported. (Earlier on Sunday the spokesman had said that Mr. Hege had died, but he backed off that statement three hours later.)

A few days ago, I woke up today depressed. I thought about staying in bed. I thought about quitting the diet. I thought about this blog. I hadn’t written anything in a few days because things were the same. My weight was the same, the diet was the same and there was no movement in either direction. How incredibly depressing. At the two week marked I prayed there would be some change, something to hearald in the third week of the diet to keep me motivated. No change.

Sorry, I couldn’t resist “poking the bear”.
Those same prominent jewish groups joined with muslims and the Catholic Church, the media, and the EU ruling caste to condemn a popular, secular Swiss vote banning minarets. Led by jewish example and jewish rhetoric they all take the slightest indication that the Swiss want Switzerland to remain Swiss as a sign of "nazism", which they see as a mortal threat. Never mind the mortal threat to the Swiss. In this and dozens of recent examples across the West, opposition to genocidal levels of immigration is more and more explicitly described as bad for jews and the alien migrants they identify and sympathize with. The rationale is that such opposition threatens them with genocide.

I suppose, all things considered, it's not the most snow ever accumulated in one spot--that distinction being reserved for glaciers, and nordic tundras, and such. It is, nevertheless, and a whole bunch more snow than I'm used to dealing with. Much, much more than Bergen is used to seeing.
You know what I love? It's you guys. I've been going through a rough spot in, it seems, everything. My life is changing in so many small ways. There seem to be more things to conquer, more things to achieve, and less time to do it all.

I think it is hard to conclude what a good Phat Thai is without sounding too subjective but I can certainly point out those bad ones where carrot, broccoli and ketchup are added or Chinese chives are being replaced by spring onions.
Asked to visualise a pub in Central London that served Bitter at £1.96 and lager not far above you would perhaps imagine a scene from Hogarth of ravaged alcoholics staring mournfully into their beer in an equally decrepit pub. A mobility scooter parked in the corner its basket in front full of dented tins and Special Brew. Such places exist but they certainly aren't the Crown and Sugarloaf or for that matter any of the other Sam Smith's pubs in Central London. Tucked away off Fleet Street its easy to imagine it once being a smoky joint serving Journalists and and printworkers. These days the clientele are more likely to be Bankers and Barristers.
As ever, this week’s challenge contained an interpretative dilemma: should I submit a composition about two individual objects, such as my sentimental favourite – the cat. Red, playing fisticuffs with a spray of deep orange dates? On the other hand, I was drawn to photographs examining two different ideas, such as the invasion of the Piazza San Marco of a Sunday evening. I was also drawn to photographs where the elements comprised one of the subjects of the composition.

One thing she didn’t quite learn was that buffalo are not to be hunted! And on several occasions, she would pop up in the middle of a breeding herd of buffalo, stalking a calf, only to be promptly chased up the nearest tree – a potentially lethal game if no tree is in reach! Around the middle of 2010, Nkateko and Rockfig were looking like casualties of war; Nkateko has a large wound on her right cheek, and concurrently, Rockfig was sporting a nasty gash on her right ear, a gash first seen after she and Nkateko were found fighting over an impala kill. Just over three months later, Rockfig died from that ear injury; Nkateko made a full recovery, and despite losing her mother, continued her success as a newly independent cub showing great hunting and survival skill. Her ability to hoist a fully grown female impala carcass into the upper branches of a marula tree at the age of only 21 months was quite something, and we knew she would be fine.
So, what's the appeal of this pre-school, post-industrial snack to a peripatetic couple in a much bigger carriage? In a bite, Goldfish are tasty little things. They dull the sharp edge of hunger and stave off cravings until we reach our destination for a 'real' meal. They're perfect for eating with one hand and driving with the other, but still allow for quick reaction when both appendages are needed on the wheel. And they're better than caffeine: when the hypnotic ribbon of road ahead lulls me into drowsiness, nothing else snaps me back to alertness than a burst of sharp processed cheese flavor and the sound of contented crunching.

Forget if you can, or get on with what you may. I use what I have to use, to get on with things. Sometimes it’s the less than desirable route, sometimes it passes over a night fold. Wipe it away the best you can, and if you can’t handle it push it somewhere fast and far. Or make it into something useful, and leave something for someone to read, look at, or listen to.
The question remains how Microsoft will generate a profit from Skype. Skype is continuing to make a loss and its paid user base is only 5%, (although this did see a 19% growth last year). It is highly unlikely that Microsoft would risk alienating the 500 million odd users by removing the free services. After all, Microsoft have a history of supporting unpaid use of its products – Hotmail, Windows Live, Office Live and an assortment of free applications, e.g. SyncToy. During the press conference announcing the deal, Bates and Microsoft C.E.O. Steve Ballmer, made several references to advertisements and this will likely be their main emphasis in the near future.

Most of the beer market is lager, and within this figure, premium lager (around 5% ABV) fell by 18%, while standard lager (around 3.5-4.4% ABV) fell by only 4%. So less beer is being sold, and within that, the steepest decline is for higher ABV drinks.

I yelled at one of the other students to get help and worked to get them separated. The recipient of most of the punishment was crumpled in a ball on the sidewalk by the time I was able to wrest Sandra away. I had to physically place myself in between her and the sobbing girl to keep Sandra from jumping on her again. I bear-hugged Sandra to keep her arms pinned and talked a de-escalating, soothing patter while my heart beat a hysterical tempo inside me.

This presentation discusses an 1889 will that was denied in 1900 with no stated reasons. An exhaustive search of records resulted in the likely reason and made the machinations of one son a little easier to see and made the reasons behind some documents a little more clear.

PETER CASE AND PAUL COLLINS 2012 TOUR DATES:
In my opinion, this is their best album and Manic Pop Thrill came in second. Their songs in all of their releases is an eclectic mix of Brit pop, dance (house ?) music, folk. Plus their highly political lyrics make this album very interesting.

Konrath and Blake are charismatic and motivational speakers. If you read their posts, know that’s pretty much them as panelists. Lots of energy and rah-rah self-pubbing. Lots of sharing of stats, but no real way of translating what they’ve done into solid strategies for what you can do. In fact, one of Konrath’s next ventures is into the Nook First program, which is by invitation only. Listening to him is like listening to Stephen King explain how traditional publishing can catapult you onto the New York Times Bestseller lists for weeks at a time. Interesting, yes; inspirational, yes; but grain-of-salt when trying to apply any of it to your own strategies.

After high school I went to art college and I guess you can say that artists are rarely conservative thinkers. Art is often about challenging boundaries, whether one’s own or society’s. Nice and pretty art has its place but it doesn’t say much. Art is often political. Just ask those who have been incarcerated over time for their writing or paintings or performances. But that’s another post.

It is in moments like these that the well-adjusted fantard must realize, it is the greatest thrill in the world to meet your idols for the first time, but you must never ever forget the thrill of the chase that preceded it. In other words, not to steal clichés or anything, but it is the journey—as much as the destination—that makes these experiences worth living for. The fact that you have pined so ardently for Perfume, for so long, is what makes that meeting special. (If some random dude met Perfume on the red carpet, it would not mean nearly as much, now would it?)
It is amazing how efficient the police can be when it comes to finding enemies of Zion. Unlike the usual slow, and lazy policing of the knuckle-scraping dimwitted buffoons of the State, when Jews are involved the police spring into action with such speed that it is almost as if they knew who they were looking for before the crime was committed!

Whether you’re a student going to school out of state or an adult who lives across the country, keeping in communication with your family is important. Here are a few tips on how to stay connected with your loved one without being annoying. First off, I would suggest contacting a member of your family at least once a week. This shows them that you care and provides a window back home, which can help with homesickness.

I think it takes having lived a full life to finally figure what really does matter. When we are children, what really matters is growing up, being an adult — we want to be older! When we are in high school, we want to get into a good college, then get a good job (good luck!). Then there is career, family, children of our own and our aspirations for them. The answer to the question “what really matters” keeps changing.

Hoeller was consecrated by Palatine in 1967 and for a number of years worked within the fold of his Church and other groups. His Los Angeles-based Ecclesia Gnostica (Church of Gnosis) grew out of his work with the Pre-Nicene Church, and Hoeller has been an indefatigable author and synthesizer, drawing upon ancient Gnostic sources, Jungian psychology, and esoteric Christian concepts, in an effort to construct a modern Gnostic presence.
I saw that the Romans, even back then, acted similar to how people act in times of disaster. This is showed when Kuanto and the other pirates take a simple job and turn it into a money making business by taking advantage of the vulnerable and start kidnapping innocent children to sell just to make extra money. This reminds me of when New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina and the people were stealing from each other.

On Thursday evening, Sergio once again talked me into “finding the party” and this time I was awake enough to join him. On our way out of Deco Walk Hostel we bumped into another of his friends; Corstan, a German IT Developer who had taken a three-week holiday on the East Coast, who decided to come with us to grab some pizza. Corstan had been out with Sergio the night before and couldn’t face another heavy night boozing on Ocean Drive. On crossing a road, Sergio bumped into yet more friends; Nik and Ingrid from New York, who after a little hesitancy amid claims of “too much pizza” decided to also decided to come with us for food.
When you add a curves adjustment layer, Photoshop has already assumed that you want a mask to go with it. The default mask is white, which means that the adjustment is going to show everywhere by default. Click on the mask and paint in some black, however, and you can mask out the adjustment. In fact, it's not about black and white, you can mask with shades of gray (i.e. at a lower opacity) for even more control. But in this example, I just want a clean mask: black out the building and leave the curves adjustment for the sky only.

There certainly has been a lot of ugly, most of it in the form of anti-Asian racism that seems to have reared its ugly head. Because really, what better time to unleash hate-speak and make crude jokes than when tens of thousands of people have lost their lives? It's incredibly disheartening, disgusting and inexcusable to me. And since I really don't want to make it just a footnote to this post, I'm going to save my thoughts on it for another time. Expect lots of cursing and angry jabs at the air with my finger.
Wisdom teeth. I had my first two wisdom teeth taken out around this time. My advice to you is to get them all out at once. If you need two out, you’ll always need the second two out. The dentist put me under for this with laughing gas. Laughing gas is great. If it is ever offered – TAKE IT. This is my conversation with the dentist, as I remember it, while under the influence:

When Carlos became the king of Spain he brought Gregorio with him and put him in charge of the Hacienda, head of taxation, and in 1763, secretary of war. Spain needed the money. Following the “Family Pact” of the different branches of the Bourbon households Spain and France were obsessed by the idea of reducing the power of Great Britain. The Seven Years War by which France attempted this (and spectacularly failed) was going on and Spain joined in in 1762. Carlos thought Britain’s success would upset the European balance of power. However, he wasn’t very successful. Spain were thrown back when they tried to invade Portugal and lost the major trading ports of Havana and Manila. The 1763 Treaty of Paris also saw Spain give Florida to Britain for the return of the two ports. Which meant that the end of the war that sucked up all the funds coincided with Esquilache’s best money-making scheme ever. He inaugurated the La Primitiva, the mainstay of the Spanish lottery, which still, two hundred and fifty years later, is a source of income for the

I thought it was going to be quite straightforward. I have a diary and blog posts written at the time. Surely all I had to do was gather them together, edit them, expand on a few bits and throw in a couple of stories about particular images.
In late December 1999 I left a job in healthcare marketing and took a week’s vacation before starting a new position at an advertising agency representing Guide Corporation. I’d spent 11 years helping not-for-profit hospitals and was eager to test my skills in the for-profit “real world.”

But despite this influx of tourists, Nerja remains a town with its own rhythms and a daily life far from the crazy crowd who invade the town during the summer months. It was at Nerja that I found a shop called Manos selling artisanal leather bags made completely by hand in a tiny atelier. Unfortunatey I wasn't allowed to take pictures of their beautiful bags but I did get a picture of the designer at work. It is a family run business that has been selling out of Nerja since 1974. Their only other shop is in an even tinier town called Frigiliana up on the mountain.

What I like about Ivy’s books in this series is the saucy and steamy and sometimes goofy dialogue between her characters. And this one has its moments. (Yes — little Levat the gargoyle is back!) But this story gets weighed down a bit with the premise of resurrecting the Dark Lord and who would want to bring him back/who loses if he is alive. It’s confusing. It takes a bit of wading through it all but you finally figure out that Laylah is protecting a baby (not hers) who some say is a vessel for the Evil Lord and some say isn’t. Of course, she thinks the baby is innocent and goes out of her way to protect her charge. And Tane — who was so menacing and freaking scary in Book 6 and Book 5 of the series — is totally enticed by Laylah. They battle and then wind up falling for each other etc. He gets caught up in her cause to save the baby as well. But because of this Dark Lord plot and the introduction of other characters — Laylah’s evil aunt who is a vampire and her sidekick bad-boy mage — the story isn’t as clean or easy to follow as her other books. Brief scenes with Caleb and Cassandra are not really developed and pop up in odd parts of the story. So, you lose a bit of the tension between Tane and Laylah and their story, which Ivy usually captures so well in her other relationships in the series.

However, its first article on the arts - Now everyone is really a critic - caused a minor storm this morning among the theatregoers, bloggers, critics and journalists who hang around twitter.

Bloggers are rising up to tell Sydney theatre lovers what they really think of the latest plays, with no punches pulled."
Although I quite like the idea of this dress, someone must have said it was a bad idea. Apart from the smell (of the meat and Gaga) it looks pretty grim. Someone must be having a laugh at her expense. Or maybe she's having a laugh at our expense, does anyone really care? sadly yes, they do. I want to kill myself just because I'm writing this about her, more hype and publicity. Oh man, it never ends.
Every rational number has an infinite repeating decimal expansion. In particular, every integer admits two decimal expansions: one with and one without a "tail of nines". This means that 1 = 0.9999…, a provable fact that many people still choose to disbelieve. What do I mean here by "provable"? I mean "provable by finitistic reasoning", that is, by a purely algebraic proof free of notions of continuity or convergence. The proof in this particular (and particularly popular) case goes like this:

Prague, Czech Republic. Live music in the days, and after-parties that go into the wee hours, can be found throughout the 17 days of the annual Czech Beer Festival in Prague. The event raises the largest beer tent in the country, packing in up to 10,000 thirsty festival-goers to sample from over 70 selections of Czech beer, served in trademark glass pitchers. Around 200 young boys and girls don traditional costumes to serve the brews, which are paid for with the festival’s own currency, the “tolar.” (May 17 – June 2)

But what about the other guy on the receiving end of this confession. Let's assume, for one moment that he's not an acknowledged homosexual (though he might be quietly aware of that particular sexual preference) and assume he's not the kind to kill or beat the ever living crap out of someone just because he admitted to caring about him, because, in either case, minimal soul-searching is required. If he's an acknowledged homosexual, he can answer with a similar freedom a heterosexual would have if the confessor were a different gender. If he's answering with violence, again, little thinking is required.

Of course, going back to my point about religious conservatives, to be fair it should also be said that it’s also conservative religious people who are doing the most for the refugee population. I don’t see many non-religious far-left-wing people helping out down at the mission.
In Hendrix’s answer lies the Imago ethos: if your unconscious mind has already “done a selection”, as he puts it, then the raw components of a great relationship are already there. It’s then up to each spouse to work towards ceasing negativity, and increasing empathy – preferably through couples dialogue.

6. (C) Meles said that the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) strategy would be to push the CIC back to Mogadishu, the only place where the radical Islamic ideology is entrenched. The longer the delay in pushing back the CIC, the greater the range of conversion. For now, however, the only area where they are entrenched is Mogadishu. The best case scenario, according to Meles, is that the businessmen and other pragmatic elements in Mogadishu would split if the CIC were bottled up in Mogadishu. This would allow dialogue with the TFG and moderate CIC elements to move forward. "Right now, the Jihadists would have to be stupid to dialogue with a weakened and surrounded TFG. Their objective is only to legitimize themselves so they can take power," Meles stated. Meles recalled that although the TPLF and other rebels wanted the USG on their side when they were about to defeat Ethiopia’s former Derg regime, they saw no reason to negotiate power sharing when it was evident to the rebels that they could completely defeat the Derg. Meles warned that the international community should not bank on dialogue at this point when the CIC is sure that victory is at hand. One of the reasons the Arab League is biased toward the CIC is
I began my card by first coloring the flower stamp using my Stampin' Up! markers and then I stamped it onto my card stock. Then I stamped my grass using the image on the other side of the stamp (this is a double mounted set). I first used wild wasabi ink and I inked up the stamp and then stamped off onto a scrap piece of card stock and then onto the bottom portion of my card. I repeated this step again, this time using chocolate chip ink.

And much less surprisingly, F.D. Roosevelt, found in Mussolini's policies part of his inspiration for the semi-socialist "New Deal" and referred to Mussolini in 1933 as "that admirable Italian gentleman". Mussolini was plausible to an amazingly wide range of people -- not the least to the people of Italy.
So the Jews related to Paul in the same scientific way. They knew that Jesus of Nazareth lived and that he was but a man. They knew that He had followers but it was no more than any number of sects that came and went. They knew that He taught but so did many other religious leaders of the day.
And we have a choice. We can choose to be a prisoner to the Monday monotony. We can opt to start the day lamenting over all that must be done, versus the little time to do it. Or we can look to Jesus, who is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Because He remains faithful, we can approach the day with gratitude at His goodness. He is God on Monday, just as much as He is God on Sunday. Your lists and problems don't intimidate Him. Your emotions don't surprise Him. Your weakness doesn't weaken Him.
Everyone knows the story on Fitzpatrick. He went to Harvard and got a degree in economics. He was a 7th round pick of the St. Louis Rams in the 2005 NFL draft. After spending the 2005 and 2006 seasons with the Rams and making 3 starts Fitzpatrick was traded to the Cincinnati Bengals prior to the 2007 season for a 7th round pick in the 2008 draft. Fitzpatrick spent two seasons on the Bengals, starting 12 games in 2008 for the injured Carson Palmer, before heading into unrestricted free agency prior to the 2009 season. On February 27, 2009 the Buffalo Bills signed Ryan Fitzpatrick to a 3 year, 6.9 million contract to back-up former 3rd round pick and incumbent starter Trent Edwards.

A man is judged by his friends, a man is judged by those he associates with and a man is judged by those he supports, therefore it is only reasonable and fair that anyone that supported the ANC over the past hundred years be judged by his support of the ANC. It also then stands to reason that anyone who supports and finances terrorists must be a terrorist himself, even if he does try to disguise the terrorists by calling them "Freedom Fighters".

I was still a mere child when I entered the doors of junior high that first day of the first semester of my sixth grade year in South Carolina. Boys were cute, but I never imagined wanting to date them, let alone kiss them. I’m pretty sure it was only months after the Civil War and the days of Antebellem had ended when we moved to SC. The state was a little behind the times. But at least it was ahead of Alabama during the time of Govenor George Wallace’s rule and his desire for apartheid or segregation or something like that. So, I'm being a lot harsh on the Deep South for being a little behind the times on adapting to social trends and you know, that whole acceptance thing. Whatevs.

So while I know that climbing trees is a risky endeavor (they could break an arm!), I let my boys climb. (With some restrictions: the rule at our house has always been that you must be able to get into and out of the tree on your own.) I let them climb because I understand that it’s important for kids to test limits, to stretch their muscles and imaginations and to spend time in nature. When it comes to tree climbing, I personally believe that the benefits outweigh the risks.
Well, now it's official; it's been one year ago since I started my blog, and I'm happy to say, I'm still here! And I plan to be around for a lot longer.

I have been thinking a great deal, as I have for many years now, of what living within our limits means. I'm speaking ecologically, not personally, now. We have exhausted this planet, and we're at a tipping point. It's as if we believe we have divine right to take what we want, from where we want, simply by virtue of being human, 'top of the tree', as we mistakenly, in my view, see it. The planet may or may not survive; ecosystems simply won't, humans included, if we don't change things. I know this is a view that many people find hard to swallow; some of the changes are unpalatable. But I believe we urgently need to address this – the issue is too desperate to be dressed-down (or do I mean dressed up?). If we don't reduce our consumption, it will be drastically reduced for us. We worry about the economy: without an ecology there is no economy.

Education: I was a public school kid and then when I finally got out of that place I attended a research university that is one of US News and World Report’s top 50 national universities. I majored in social science and biological science. Yeah, I know it’s weird, but I loved it. My fellow alumni have won Nobel Peace Prizes, Academy Awards, Pulitzer’s, been Olympians, Hall of Fame football players, legendary philanthropists and businessmen, four star generals, and have been leaders in science and medicine. Wow, now I feel like a slacker. What the hell have I been doing? “Sure Doctor Whosit, you cure cancer and I’ll follow loser hockey players around.” Geesh!

I find that one a little martial for my taste, but this highlights the mainspring of the tragedy in these poems. These men weren’t unwilling conscripts: so many of them left school and university with heads full of Virgil and Horace, and marched straight into a human abbatoir. This was what Wilfred Owen was driving at when he quoted Horace in Dulce et Decorum est, which inevitably is featured in this volume. I shan’t quote from it, because everyone knows it already. This classical education, which encouraged verse composition, gives rise to moments of elegiac beauty, like this from Leslie Coulson’s From the Somme. He was killed in 1916.

I'm not gonna' lie, it was kind of amazing. My vision of a wheat grinder is remembering the BEAST of a thing we had growing up that, I swear, shook the walls and would probably mangle your hand if given the opportunity (did it even have a wood frame, Mom?). I showed Isabel what grains of wheat looked like, poured 2 or 3 cups at a time into the grinder's top, and earned Mother of the Year (hey, even temporarily is worth something, right?) when I removed the base to reveal our freshly-milled flour.
It’s to the book’s credit that commuters will hang on to handle bars on their long commute to the office and back, sufficiently gripped by the plot to be lost to the world around them, a moment of peace fathomed among the pages of a book to the comforting feel of paper.

The gym acts as an unofficial support group to many people. Members often drop by just for a chat, even if they don’t have time for a workout. As far as we can, we help one another – we don’t pry, we don’t push but I guess we provide a listening ear, share suggestions, introduce helpful people. You can’t put a price on that.

These are great workouts for someone who is already in shape and does cardio, but wants to accomplish a little sculpting as well. It is several short workouts that focus on different muscle groups in the body. It works out your core, arms, butt, thighs, shoulders – even muscles you may not know you have. The workouts are short, so you can do anything from one if you are in a hurry, to the whole DVD.

Whatever you call it, it is happening, even the media have now been forced to admit that the native white population of Britain will have become an ethnic minority in their ancestral homeland by 2066. Many suspect that estimate is a conservative one, and that is likely to be much sooner than that, in much of England it most certainly will be sooner.

As an adult, the nicknames become more random. Starting in college, Puffyhead has become the universal nickname when my hair is all curly and au natural, nothing done to it after a shampoo, condition and slight gel except let it dry. No, it’s not an afro. It’s just full and curly. Flathead is its complete opposite, when the flattening iron or a great straightening treatment has made my hair bone straight, flat on my head.

75 years ago today the German Luftwaffe and Italian Aviazione Legionaria carried out an aerial raid, on behalf of General Franco’s Fascist forces, on a small town seen as being of strategic importance in the struggle for the control of Spain. The name of that town became stamped on the world’s consciousness, both because it was one of the first ever bombing raids on a defenceless civilian population and also because it inspired the creation of one of the twentieth-century’s most powerful works of art.

It seems, lately, like I've been seeing a lot of similar statements. However, a lot of the time, they're different in one key aspect: many of them say something along the lines of "Travel is my biggest priority and you're wasting your life if it isn't yours too." Here's the thing: as much as I'd like to tell everyone that their money is only worthwhile if they're doing something to expand their horizons, I don't know them. I don't know their lives, their jobs, their family situations, or anything else about them- who am I to say what they should or shouldn't be spending their money on? I've been incredibly privileged my entire life: my parents retired younger than most, have always put a huge emphasis on the importance of exploration, and, though money was never plentiful, were able to save up to take us away on nice vacations that I took for granted for far too long. I'm also very thankful that, as an adult, I've never been out of work, have always had enough money to feed myself and pay my bills, and was able to save up money and take time off for work with relative ease. I don't have kids to leave at home, a job that would fire me if I tried to take time off, or trouble making ends meet as it is. Basically, what I'm trying to say is, if you can travel, you're lucky. Privilege 'n stuff.

According to a statement from the Association of American Physicians & Surgeons, or AAPS, the numbers from California show that reported autism rates hit a high of 800 in May 2003. If that trend had continued, the reports would have risen to more than 1,000 by the beginning of 2006. But the number actually went down to 620, a real decrease of 22 percent, and a decrease from the projection of 35 percent.
I’m not sure I would recommend this book for everyone. If you’re interested in autism it’s an interesting read— reading the book in this light, you think about what Christopher has issues with, how he goes about solving issues or thinking about things, and following his logic is really fascinating. The book is a quick and easy read though: so if interested, it doesn’t take much investment.

At Standerton the camp was erected on both banks of the Vaal River. It was on the Highveld, which ensured that it was extremely cold in winter and infested with mosquitoes in summer. The fact that Standerton had turf soil and a high rainfall, ensured that the camp was one big mud bath in summer, even inside the tents.

Fairly obviously, members of that media set potentially offer politicians four things: coverage biased in their favour, censorship of stories harmful to them, inside information on beartraps lying in wait for them, and overt Party support in terms of money and/or editorial endorsement. In return, media moguls want access to power – from a combination of egoistic and commercial motives.

I thought about writing you a letter for several weeks but never did anything about it, resigning myself to the fact that even if I wrote you a letter and tried to submit it as fan mail, you would never get to read it. And then Heather visited us with the baseball you signed for Margaret. Unbelievable! It was totally unexpected and delivered with perfect timing. Given the emotions your milestone save had evoked in me, receiving your autographed ball was like receiving a sign from God and a wink from Jack in heaven. I asked Heather if she could deliver a letter to you. She graciously said she would. I could not believe I had the opportunity to have my letter hand delivered to you. But then I remembered Jack's favorite bible verse: For nothing is impossible with God. Luke 1:37. Thanks Jack. And thank you Mariano for all you do, both on the field and off.

Plenty of other producers out there, however, do draw explicitly on their Christianity in crafting their dubstep. As with Buddhist Death Metal, there’s a whole series of websites that act as gathering spaces for Christian electronic dance music culture: christianremix.com, GodsDJs.com, and so on. The logo for the latter is a crucifix with headphones on. A frequent comment is that most dubstep deals with ‘bad things’ or dirty themes, with numerous people calling for or thanking people for creating clean dubstep devoted to ‘the good.’ We see throughout these websites that independent producers situate their music creation firmly within their religious journey; they are “worshipping God through the music,” and celebrating each other’s “dubstep for Christ.” According to one forum poster, it is a “serious blessing to hear the dubstep sound represented with Christ as the focus.” “Jesus wubs you,” others say.

Unlike the other cards in this round, I happen to really like the design of the Fleer Focus set. I must be in the minority though because Focus didn't last all that long as a set if I recall correctly. Even so, the little baseball cap on the front and the giant faded team logo on the back make for a nice looking card. Of the four cards in this round, I'd probably cast my vote for the Focus card...but that doesn't matter (except in the case of tie-breakers) as this is a vote determined entirely by my readers!

It should be crystal clear why BHO with Soetoro and SAD1 adorns the “Dead Man Rune.” During BHO’s second stage formative years in Indonesia, BHO had been conditioned and desensitized to human rights and ritualized mass murder by one of General Suharto’s butchers, his stepfather Col. Soetoro. BHO had been initiated into an Indonesian pagan ritual “DEATH CULT” with a historical human rights violation “BODY COUNT” and record of genocide.

Why would they do such a thing? While my Mom’s 16-year-old son is awake in his bedroom and can easily come out at any given moment? I understand they got the urge and blah blah.

What freaks me out though is I was afraid that if I did actually interrupt them, that they wouldn’t even stop. I mean, you’d think they’d hear me come out of my room and walk into the kitchen right?
Meanwhile, acrobatic Two-Bit Jack Ginth rode a rope up to the balcony and sent a chandelier crashing down around a group of guards. His comrade in crime, W.B.

An avowed pyromaniac, Ginth ran along the balcony knocking over lamps and lanterns and setting tapestries afire as the guards turned and ran up the stairs to head him off again. He kicked out a window however and deftly dropped down by way of a torn tapestry to the courtyard below In the distance he saw the same bell tower that McGarnagle had entered.

As with all communities, there are always those who express unhappiness or do not like the decisions being made by a board. Many times this personality is one who complains but does not offer solutions or act to make a difference by volunteering. Whether the issue is upgrades to common areas or an increase in assessments, some folks will never agree with or support the actions of a board. On the other side a board must act in the best interest of the entire community, regardless of individual opinions. The board has a fiduciary duty to uphold.

So, as you may or may not know, I had decided to give up all the crappy foods/sugars that I'd been gorging on for the past few months. I started last Monday and basically stopped eating the cookies, pudding, ice cream etc that I had been eating. On Thursday, I probably could have killed someone for even a Hershey's kiss, but today, day 9, I'm feeling GOOOOODDDD!!! And I got on the scale this morning and lo and behold, as a reward for my eating better and cutting out the crap, my scale is down 4.5 lbs since Monday the 16th. That is the most I've lost in a little over a week in a really long time. I noticed that since I wasn't eating the crap, I also wasn't really eating much more than my 3 meals and a small snack either.. amazing how this has worked for me.. I gotta tell you, 2.5 years out from Band Surgery and I'm still learning something new or relearning things every day!

When you came into my life after Shahzeb, I thought that I was yet to fall in love with you. I always believed that love happens just once. And I had lost that chance for someone like Shahzeb. But you know what? I was wrong. It is today that I realize, that I never loved him the way I love you. Yes! I LOVE YOU. I might have fallen for him, but what I feel for you is light years stronger than what I felt for him. Love is what I feel for you. And I know you feel the same. It’s just that you realized it at the very beginning and I took some time for that.

Another good vacation book is Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, which I actually read for book club, but I started it on vacation. This is a light read, historical fiction set in a circus during the Great Depression, but with more than a touch of fantasy to it. It is also a love story, and romances are very appropriate for vacation reads, although I have to admit that the love story was the least fulfilling aspect of the novel for me.
Take the cupcakes out of the freezer - just a few at a time so they do not sweat. Hold the cupcake firmly by the paper liner and invert it into the pot of melted glaze. Submerge the cupcake just up to the paper line and move it about to insure the entire surface is covered. Pull the cupcake straight up and gently spin it above the bowl by rotating your wrist, to allow any excess glaze to drip off. Flip the cupcake and carefully place it on a wire rack to set. Allow the glaze to set for 3 to 5 minutes at room temperature.

Overall effect is typical fifties Hal Roach Jr. sitcom style with that nice if antiquated ambience you used to see in his other productions from AMOS 'N ANDY on down.

So now you have to spend more money sending in for the crap-shoot auto you didn't get when they had the "EMAIL" system set up in place to cover this well botched quality control issue. How can such a delayed product like this one have this kind of a mess up? Kudos to Topps for stepping in quickly again to fix a "quality control" issue. However just because Topps has stepped up to quickly "correct" the situation does not mean they're going to fall back into the "good graces" of the hobby enthusiasts. It's also apparent that topps are giving you less product then advertised if you're a set builder. How many other times has this happened where they're selling something that does not match the advertised sell sheets? You're getting about 350 cards instead the advertised 450. FAIL! NOT WINNING!

So much better to have this handy tool in the drawer.

Welcome to my blog hop. Everyday from April 2nd through April 12th I will link to a different blog as part of my celebration of the release of my book The Pulse of Mixed Media: Secrets and Passions of 100 Artists Revealed. There will be book reviews, personal thoughts, and giveaways. And every blogger along the way will become part of the book, as they will also post their own responses to their choice of survey questions from the book. You too can be part of The Pulse by responding to my open call for art!

Unfortunately, there has been little guidance and movement toward how my colleagues and I are to move forward in the development of brand new curriculum and the pedagogical changes that must be made. As I wrote to you all last week, anything from the Mexican American Studies perspective is now illegal for the former MAS teachers. We are being asked to use the district adopted textbooks as the model for how to move forward. We have been told that we can still teach about race and sensitive topics, which is contradiction to earlier direction from our school/site administrators, but we must be balanced and cannot reflect MAS perspectives, although this has yet to be defined.

Some Americans assume that religious groups offer aid to entice converts. That’s incorrect. Today, groups like World Vision ban the use of aid to lure anyone into a religious conversation.

The film that comes closest is Lorna’s Silence, but even that film jumps in time and fails for fully completely either of the acts, which might be why it’s perceived as one of the weaker Dardennes films. The Son deals with the forgiveness half while The Child addresses the reprehensible offense. This is not to say the other half is not addressed in either film, but it tends to exist as that which remains off-screen, what is suggested but never shown.

Friends of old Christmas music:
A day alone delights me. Even though my husband is off to work on the weekend, I rise early with gliding fingers of thought that eventually wrap around my pen. Starched ideas—fresh from a renewed mind—cloth me when I write, when I rest, and when I create.
Of the Alma Negra wines, the two which most impressed me were the Misterio (the "mystery") and Gran Misterio. The name is an homage to the fact that we know so little about everything, and should pay close attention to what we do not know. An intriguing philosophical thought, and how many other wines do you know where the name has such a deep, intellectual meaning?

But the United States is still far behind the European Union, where, for example, 100 percent of the eggs that McDonald’s uses are from free-range chickens, which are allowed to roam outside. Laws governing farm animal welfare are more strict in the EU and give the animals more freedom to roam.

From an intelligence perspective, the raid struck pay-dirt in Abbottabad. Names, numbers, emails, locations, as well as discussions over planned operations were recovered in thousands of electronic files and documents removed from the compound.
Last summer, I tried to read A Passage to India. It was a shame that I had two E. M. Forsters lying around but I had read none. Plus, Bangladesh and India have a shared history, and there’s no way I will miss reading a book about the colonial period in India and imagining being in the shoes of Gandhi passing comments on the book. But, getting past the first chapter was a challenge; I am not too fond of books that spend too much energy on describing a city instead of subtly weaving these descriptions into the story, and A Passage to India dedicates its entire first chapter to descriptions of the city. All of that changed in Dr Erin’s class.
No one can deny that consumer awareness of the existence of the elephant remains the key to our success. In July 2005 and again last March, a think tank was co-sponsored by the Society of Actuaries and the Intercompany Long Term Care Insurance Conference. A small group of dedicated and enthusiastic “elephant behavior” experts gathered to consider future directions and priorities. As a participant in both sessions I was impressed and inspired by the moral force of goodwill. We came together with non-denominational intentions to work together to identify a focused path to help create our own elephant graveyard.

Fame is impossible without an audience, though the nature of the audience (and the relationship between audience and famous object) changes considerably throughout history, from patrons of the classical artists conferring social and cultural validity, to God and the pantheon of Saints conferring spiritual divine approval, to the modern mass audience which has arisen since the printing press and other broadcast technologies, which in many ways creates the famous person in its own image, investing the aspirations of the obscure admirers into those who have made their way into the spotlight.

While the children are eating bednight snack, John is usually checking the WeatherChannel.com or PostGazette.com, and I am usually reading. While doing these very important things, we glance up frequently to see who is done eating. As soon as we see someone is done, we lovingly tell that individual, “Get upstairs and put your pj’s on!” Max often does this on his own without being asked. Jack has to be reminded several times. Maggie will only go upstairs if somebody else is already up there, since she is afraid to go upstairs by herself in the dark. Lucy will leave the room the first time she is told to put her pajamas on, but she will often become sidetracked by something else and we find her 10 minutes later playing in a far corner of the house, still not in her pajamas. While the kids straggle up to their rooms, I clean up the amazingly high number of plates and dishes generated by 4 kids and bednight snack. And that brings us to the most dreaded phase of the bedtime routine, brushing teeth.

It is blatantly obvious that politicians ONLY go there for photo opportunities. I do not believe for one minute they really give that much of a damn about morale boosting. They make cuts to budgets, pay has been capped at 1% which is is, in real terms, a pay cut, the soldiers don't have the equipment they need. They are going to make cuts to the staff, are decommissioning ships. They are making cuts which military experts deem to be dangerous. Military experts. As opposed to government workers.

One Sunday only a couple of weeks before Christmas, I was sitting in the women's Relief Society meeting at church and the women were having a discussion about Christmas traditions. We were asked to share our Christmas traditions aloud. I sat there listening to wonderful suggestions. All of them sounded lovely—traditions I wanted to incorporate into our lives to make the season merry. But they all sounded so unattainable from the place we were at with the house.

My dad was terrified and felt rather helpless. You see, they were on this houseboat on a night with just a sliver moon that wouldn't even rise until about 5:30am., no spotlight and a VERY treacherous lake, twenty miles from the closest marina and medical help. Lake Powell is full of unknowns under the water. It can be a dangerous lake to navigate in the daylight, much less the darkest of nights with no light on the boat. My mom relates now that my dad was trembling and he tried to hold her and offer her some sort of comfort. I can only imagine the anguish that they were both experiencing. My mom wrote up a summary of events as she remembered them. I hope she doesn't mind if I put some of that here in my own record of things:
Saturday was a big day. Earlier in the week I was looking at the badges available on foursquare and I saw an ESPN College GameDay badge. I knew that College GameDay was going to be Palo Alto at Stanford and I really wanted that badge so I thought maybe I would just go to Game Day but not go to the game. The more I thought about it the more I want to go the actual game. I know my love for USC is apparent on the blog and if you follow me on twitter but one thing you don't know is that Stanford is a family favorite. My brother and dad love the school. We have gone to the USC at Stanford game for the last three times USC has played at Stanford (they play here in even years) When I was little we had season tickets and one of my most prized possesion is this....

Good news people! With the amount of vinyl rips that I occasionally provide here, one might think that I'm just an old fart living in the dinosaur ages but you'd be wrong. Vinyl record sales are back in high rotation. In 2010 Vinyl Records sales increased to become the fastest growing music format in USA and Canada. Take that digital. Also these numbers do not include all of the 100% DIY/Independent releases. Or sales from most Mom & Pop stores and bands who sell off-stage at concerts. Barcodeless-off-the-grid stuff. So the numbers are even higher than being reported. Now if you think it's just a bunch of us old hippies trying to relive our glory years you'd be wrong again. Younger people are the fastest growing market for vinyl. There are a number of factors at work here. Digital download limitations in recent months has led some customers toward searching out for higher sound quality, as well as the more authentic experience of physically putting on a record and holding and looking at the sleeve. After reading several articles I've come up with at least 10 reasons for the renewed interest in the glorious vinyl sound.
Hi my bloggy friends today begins a brand new challenge over at Stamp-n-Doodle with the theme of circles or ovals.

I repeat the story, from when I left Bayard at the apartment until the man turns the corner and begins to walk toward me. I ask the men why they think the women react so differently from them. This man showed no malice, appeared to carry no weapon, and clearly was not following me, but just minding his business. He was not enormous and didn't have a wicked mustache he was twirling evilly. The men squirm uncomfortably, realizing that the possible violence women face is more than they realized, and more deeply feared than they knew. The women are often surprised that the men don't know this is our reality.
CP: As every musician says: It’s our best album ever! Well I would says it´s the most intimate album. It tells some stories.

This idea has been done before, but it's always one of my favorites of the year! Ask each child to bring in a baby picture. Then, brainstorm some things they might be born to be (a football star, a respectful kid, etc.). We sit in a circle on the floor and put all of the baby pictures in the middle. I introduce the term Born to Be Drug Free and ask What do you think that means? How can we relate that to the baby pictures we're looking at? After this discussion, I give each child a die cut red ribbon and they write their name on it and draw pictures of things they can do instead of drugs. It makes a great bulletin board display!

This book is your essential guide that answers all these questions and more. You learn about the law, the landscape, the people and the places of 14th century England, from the perspectives of both the upper classes and the lower. Methods of cleaning, church rituals and laws, the buildings you will see and the sort of thing that will get you in trouble are looked at. In fact, after reading this you could probably survive in the 1300′s… as long as you could speak their language!

As we wipe away the tears, though, one also wonders whether this is the Spain with its rapacious commercial fishing fleet, equipped with generous EU grants, known for its plundering of British and African waters? Is this also the Spain that is so poor that it has been one of the net beneficiaries of the EU budget, hoovering up around €60 billion in EU net payments in the eleven years from 2000-2010, yet which has had enough spare cash to buy up our banks and Heathrow airport?

NHV is recreating itself and at the same time growing a bit in the process. By the spring of 2012 you’ll see a lot of new fun things coming out that we’re busy working on right now. Don’t worry, we’re not changing any of the goodness that has made people love NHV these past few years. Instead, we’re going to add a lot more of the secret sauce on top so people who like our wines can keep on liking them. We want to get the word out so those who haven’t yet tried them might heed the call and pick up a bottle. Remember, just a bottle a day, that’s all we ask.
I think we don't need another biography to tell us that Dickens did not live up to his aim of living "like his good characters" - though I shall certainly read Claire Tomalin's. But it is never a good idea to let the life dictate how the reader feels about the writer, or the composer or painter, come to that.

As creators and sellers of seasonal stuff, we must think ahead. And since we are participating in a holiday bizarre that gets stocked October 28th, we are getting in the holiday spirit around here. Not too much happening yet, but I thought I'd give you a little glimpse of winter whiteness, soon to be headed your way! And just to mess with my mind a little, I even listened to Christmas music while I worked today. It feels a little sinful thinking of Christmas in the midst of my most favorite time of year.
Speaking of cooking, I’m loving the water here. Anyone who lives off rain water tanks will known what I’m talking about. When I cook my rice porridge, it turns out all soft and delicious. When I cook it in the city it is still pretty hard – the texture is all different. Oh, and the showers! I barely have to put any shampoo or conditioner in my hair for it to come good.

Theodore Roosevelt said, “Comparison is the thief of joy.” I have to remind myself of this quote on a daily basis.

How much happier would we all be if we just focused on ourselves and the blessing in front of us? It’s easier said than done, but it needs to be done.

Observation: I guess as I think about what being born of the Spirit looks like in my life, it is important for me to remember that Jesus is not saying that I am excused from following through with the inclinations that I have received before. Rather, it is an understanding of the fact that I am not required to follow through with what the world would expect from me. If I left my job tomorrow, because I felt called by the Spirit to follow through with what God has called me to for some time, it should not bother me that I would not be living up to the expectations that others have of me.

There are two doggies walking outside!") and eventually start asking your child to identify how many there are ("Look at the doggies outside! Maia, how many doggies are there?")
I've been wanting to go to the Aquarium for such a long time. I just haven't had the chance to go or others have been too busy to join me. So, I decided to make it part of my birthday month celebrations!

Bridging the two was what I consider one of the most important posts in the history of this blog; Bringing It All Back Home, which peeled away all of the hysteria and misdirection and explained what I believed all of the Sirius and Tutankhamun symbolism surrounding the election was all about.

Marshall spent the summer preparing; downloading school bus schedules, memorizing teacher names, studying school maps, and practicing his clarinet (because in sixth grade you never know when a jam session will breakout). With overloaded backpack and trusty clarinet he plans to hit sixth grade with everything he’s got. M.Alice, his sister, has other ideas. Put Lucy Van Pelt, a pit bull and every mean girl you’ve ever known in a blender and you might end up with her equal.

This poster by McKnight Kauffer (1924) was commissioned to encourage the use of the London transport system. In the 1920′s and 30′s consumer and household buying power had begun to slowly shift to the women of the house, and increasingly advertising campaigns were directed at women. The London Underground in fact commissioned a whole series on various reasons as to why the Underground was beneficial for women to use. Strong deco and extremely modern elements in this poster are the rampant use of circle and lines, and blocks of colour with very little gradient, coupled with constant repetition. The idea that the poster portrays is the harried and difficult nature of travelling ‘above ground’ during the depths of a dark and windy winter. The poster borders on abstract, and uses text shaped to emphasize the messy predicament that the dark figure (notably a woman) finds herself in, with nothing but an umbrella to shelter from driving rain.

For the first time in a few years, I decided to get in the spirit of Spring and start a garden. The backyard has been neglected for far too long and I have a hankering to dig in the dirt! Two weeks ago, I started some seeds in preparation for a vegetable garden that will eventually fill a space off the back patio and a flower garden by the front door. So far, its been a soothing and joyful experience to watch my garden take its first breaths. It reminds of a Chinese proverb that hasn’t lost its truth despite several thousand years:
Wodehouse was the son of Eleanor and Henry Ernest Wodehouse, both members of the Norfolk landed gentry. Henry was a judge in Hong Kong, and when P.G. was three, he was sent back to England with his brothers for schooling. He spent many of his holidays with his aunts, which might have inspired the later gaggles of horrible female relatives who frequently appear in his novels.

The first half of this episode is very funny, informative too, but Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert together are a blast. Stacy cites lots of important economic and geopolitical headlines, then she gives her opinion and Max does it too, in a very honest way, I must say. The second half of this episode you should watch. I am appalled about the cruelty committed against animals by several corporations who only care about profit, with no morals at all.

I entered the house quietly like I was trained in clearing houses & I was not afraid, I checked my corners, and I decided to clear the right side of the house first since I heard noises on the left side of the house; the right side of the house was clear, and so I crossed the middle room to the left side of the house next to my grandfather’s room, and down the hallway I heard voices.

The effrontery on display is offensive but should be taken as a warning for the nation as a whole of the clear and present danger that is the current immigration system.

Clients who are strangely persistent about samples spur red flags in our office. Trust is pretty important to me. If you trust me, and I love you than I'm going to go above and beyond for you. I'm going to buy the tree peonies at $7.5 a stem even when Asheley says we're over budget. There is NOTHING more exhilarating in my work than making incredible flowers for clients who love what we do. Nothing. And no budgets, whether big or small will ever stop us from finding those people we can make happy with flowers.
The CD-version also included the alternate versions of "Over the Hills and Far Away" and "Wild Frontier", as well as an extra track, titled "Crying in the Shadows", which fits quite well into the albums overall sound, and could have easily taken the place of "Friday on My Mind".
The fermentation time varies depending on where you live. It takes me about 10-12 hours in spring. In winter, I keep the bowl in the oven so that it stays in a warm controlled environment.

So it is time for me to take break for a bit, to batten down the hatches, read a good book or two, visit my family, try to focus on the good.
And his third point was that the most important thing for governments to protect is freedom, freedom of expression and culture, rather than the rights of individual groups. If this can be ensured, he argued, then a diverse, free and fair society can be created, in which the security of all religious groups is guaranteed.

I’m sad to say that my life right now isn’t terribly interesting. I need to change that. Let’s see, though… The most interesting thing I have done in the last 12 months is take a ghost tour in Charleston, SC. Or at least half of one (high-heeled shoes are a very bad choice when walking long distances over cobble stones). It was still very interesting, though. And almost worth the three silver-dollar sized blisters on my feet.
I've been celebrating St. Patrick's Day since high school. It's the day one of my closest and oldest friends freed herself from her mother's oppressive body, and she now owns a multitude of useless gifts covered in shamrocks and leprechauns to mark the occasion. My mother in law also shares this Bday, so I have a lots of reasons to celebrate. (PS - Happy Birthday El & Maman!!) But it wasn't until I got to college that I realized the impact of this holiday.
Of course, once I sat down to do it, I discovered that it wasn’t SO bad. Sure, the first several things that came to mind were dishes I’d love to make right now, that are just not appropriate for this diet. But in the end, what was hard about it was my own mentality. I was tripping myself up by thinking about what we COULDN’T eat as opposed to focusing on what we can. And once I refocused my thinking on all the stuff I’d usually cook for L. if he had his way, I realized that there’s still a whole big world of food out there that we can all enjoy, GF/CF challenge or not.

I try to keep our room personal with photographs of the two of us and not our children. I love my children but I don't know if I want them staring down at me from the wall in my bedroom, if you know what I mean! Plus, who's going to really see their cute smiling faces in our bedroom? I like to display them in the main parts of our house where everyone can see them! I display some of our wedding pictures and various other photos of just the two of us. We try to get our mug shots together every few years at the same time when we have our family picture done. I love having professional photos of us and who doesn't like having to get dolled up and pose with their man?
What I didn’t know?
Jordana Fabuliner in Black: I remember using this felt-tip eyeliner in high school because it was so cheap ($1.99 at Walgreens) and I just rediscovered it. I honestly don’t know why I ever stopped using it! The felt tip is so saturated, so easy to work with and gives the best dark, matte finish. If you are not a fan of liquid eyeliner or have a hard time with gel eyeliner, TRY THIS. I promise you it’s amazing, and especially for the price!

The 2012 study showed the Himalayas and nearby peaks have lost almost no ice during the past 10 years. The scientists are careful to point out that lower-altitude glaciers in the Asian mountain ranges – sometimes dubbed the “third pole” – are definitely melting. Satellite images and reports confirm this. However, over the study period from 2003-10 enough ice was added to higher and more northern peaks to compensate. My view – The implications of this concluding paragraph above, I concur, are that as gradually rising global temperatures cause lower glaciers in the Himalayas to retreat, some of the additional moisture released is being deposited in the colder upper regions.

Jonny Parr has been an almost ever-present figure in the Palace side this season, playing in 39 games. It’s not a bad return for any footballer but when you consider that he came into the squad having just taken part in an almost complete season with his previous employers Aalesund, it highlights a fitness level rivalled only by Greek Gods.
I had some help from Katie when time away from school permitted. I really want my girl's to know how to do these things it can really come in handy and it tastes so good to. I will miss her when she goes to college next year even though she will live at home just know she will be away makes me start to miss her presence at home already.. I still miss my oldest and I see her ever day. Well she studies most of this time but I know she is here. I love my family very much. Families change sort of like the seasons.The seasons change, the leaves fall and the grass dies, we are reminded by this verse how short our lives are. So enjoy all the time you have with your loved ones with love and laughter and always keeping God first in your heart and life makes life so much easier. Until my next post I hope everyone is well and happy. Thanks for coming by and God bless.
- Commercial lease document relating to Sean Quinn’s current premises in Derrylin, Fermanagh described by judge as a “somewhat curious document” Not drawn up by solicitors, not referred to on Sean’s statement of affairs and despite the monthly rent being only GBP 50 (€60) payable to the landlord described as a friend, apparently necessitating a commercial lease document which referred to remedies in case of default. Also lease signatures weren’t witnessed and no evidence of correspondence involving the premises despite Sean claiming he occupied it since May 2011 and was developing businesses.
Steiner was an oddity in the occult community of his time, a genuine scholar—he’s the guy who edited the standard edition of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s scientific works—whose visionary experiences led him first into a variety of early 20th century occult circles and then to the creation of his own highly original teachings. The movement he founded, Anthroposophy, was one of the options I seriously considered, back in the day when I was first looking for a source of occult training. That didn’t turn out to be the path I chose, but even so, Steiner’s work on biodynamic agriculture has had a lot of influence on my own gardening methods, and if I’d had children, it’s a good bet that they would have gone to a school that used the Waldorf system of education that Steiner founded.
Hearst understood that the story of Carpathia‘s return would sell lots of newspapers. There would be agony and grief, with perhaps some joy and celebration thrown in, too. Hearst sent Davenport to the port to witness the arrival, and then filter the events through his own creative lens. No photographs could ever do the scene justice, but perhaps Davenport could capture it for the world to consume–after buying a newspaper, of course.

Lo and behold, Dracula reconstitutes himself (he is once again played by Christopher Lee, though this wasn’t the mortal lock you might have expected at the time). All this happens before the opening credits, which makes a refreshing change after a series of films in which Dracula doesn’t show up until quite a long way in. (There is a reason for this, which we will address in due course.)
Who knows, but I can see a trend forming over this weekend and given the pro-European Parliament we have at the moment, who would be able to stop the trend from forming into a plan and from there action?
We met on Match.com, so I printed out our profiles & our first few emails to put in the pocket.
But on the other hand you have a technically sound Canero with more power than anyone Hatton has fought. You have to question if Hatton can withstand the power of Alvarez. And this will be the first we see Hatton at light middleweight. We are used to seeing him fight at light welterweight, so you have to wonder if the extra weight will bother him. I think this is going to be a great fight and I think, although many people are counting Hatton out, the fight can go either way.
Mood-appropriate songs: "L-O-V-E" by Nat King Cole plays in a modern scene when stepparents announce to their children that they are in love and getting married. "Alone Again, Naturally" by Gilbert O'Sullivan hilariously plays while Sena tells Park Ha that she doesn't want to be her sister anymore--it's darkly funny because Park Ha has been abandoned by everyone in her life and is now getting rejection on top of rejection.
Racism in left wing circles is rampant; Black Panthers, race based hiring and admissions policy, race based contract awards, Al and Jesse inciting crowds against people based on race rather than fact--or when facts are not known--Duke rape case, whatsername Brawley, Trayvon Martin, the riot that killed the Jewish guy in NY, etc.

There is a reason, other than reading ‘Valley of the Dolls’ and thinking ‘Hey, I could totally rock that rustic-look Lawrenceville mansion of Anne’s’ - I’ve just had my wisdom teeth out. To be honest they’ve been annoying me for years, but I’ve only just had the time to get them sorted. And this isn’t the first time I’ve had a doctor poking around down the back of my throat (stop leaping ahead to your own punchlines) as I’ve already had my tonsils out too. It’s almost as if I’m making room for something back there, though I can’t think what. Of course, having friends who are as gay as tinsel, every time I mentioned I was going to be in intense pain for a week, every single one of them said “Still! No eating for a week! Oh, I envy you doing that just before Christmas...” and they would trail off before looking wistfully at a mince pie. And it is true - I’ve lost about half a stone simply by having a mouth the size and shape of the slot Princess Leah uses to put the stolen rebel plans into R2-D2.
“The expressive potential of the courtroom as symbol of an exalted process is exploited to perhaps its highest potential in Rogers’s Bordeaux courthouse where the seven courtrooms are fully revealed as separate elevated objects. The inventive power of the scheme lies in the clarifying simplicity of its organization: the essence of the courthouse is reduced to two elements, courtrooms and administrative block, each set on opposing plinths and united by a hovering roof plane. The courtrooms are expressed as highly sculptural wooden vessels, set in contrast to the mute neutrality of the glass office block. Freed from the enveloping crust of support spaces typical of the American courthouse typology, each courtroom is a discrete monument announcing the building’s purpose and meaning, without need of an intervening architectural overlay. The circulation elements that connect to the courtrooms – open bridges and stairs – emphasize the separation of the bureaucratic elements of the court from the courtroom, implying that all who enter the room do so openly and equally, without special advantage.

three. Some type of head wear is a must. After not showering for 3 days, you don't want anyone confusing your head of hair with the frying pan. Added bonus, if you throw on a hippie headband or a fishing hat, it makes you sort of look like you know what you're doing.
Monday night I wanted to get in more than the usual 5.5 miles but since it was our Run of the Month we had post-run plans for dinner at my favorite restaurant. I invited Jason to join us for dinner since I figure he's an official club member (he holds our gear at races and takes pictures). So I ended up running 2 miles to the club run starting point and then doing 5.5 miles with the club for a total of 7.5 miles. Worked out pretty well! My first two miles were quite speedy compared to the rest of them. Not really how it's supposed to go. At least the rest of the miles were fairly even? Anyway, it was a pretty good run for this time of year. It was warm out, but not stifling. I took my handheld water bottle and Jacob shared margarita flavored Shot Bloks.

Local Motors plans to release between 500 and 2,000 units of each model. It’s a niche vehicle; it won’t compete with the major automakers but rather fill in the gaps in the marketplace for unique designs. Rogers uses the analogy of a jar of marbles, each of which represents a vehicle from a major automaker. In between the marbles is empty space, space that can be filled with grains of sand — and those grains are Local Motors cars.

However, I did find Dave's attitude to be a bit on the harsh side for this interview. So be forewarned. He didn't enter into this with an incredible amount of compassion for families trying to adopt a child. It appeared he aimed the interview at couples who just wanted to adopt to do something "good for the world." He didn't seem to consider the fact that many couples are adopting because of childlessness.

Maybe amounts of individual physical titles sales will decrease, quite sure in fact, but who cares? Man has always needed to express stuff he can’t with words through other medias so, sure, there’ll always be music around and the creative mind will always create. And, when you feel the urge to “say” something through other medias than simply words, you’ll always feel the urge to have it “heard” so there’ll always have people like me around to help the “artistic sayings” being “heard”, may it be through a CD, a t-shirt or a live performance or whatever.

On the way home from the local farmers market this morning we stopped at a rummage sale. As we pulled up, my husband said it didn't look like it had much of interest, but I quickly informed him that sometimes it's the ones that look like they have nothing that have EVERYTHING! It is true that one man's trash is another man's treasure! And that was true of this little garage sale.
I look back at it now and I’m a little amazed at myself haha. Lately I’ve been feeling more called to ministry for teaching. Not just any teaching but Bible and life teaching/counsel. (If that makes sense). Looking back. For some reason everything behind always looks clearer from the present. I wouldn’t say it was a test of God well maybe…i don’t really know. But before at the time I was distressed over knowing if I was really forgiven or not for the crap I did. How do I know God? How do I know for sure? Idk if you’d call that a test or not. But a little while later I got a call from the church to watch kids once a week which would also give me some income as I had been unemployed at the time. I was slightly hesitant but I went. And you know what?! All that nastiness that used to be inside…thoughts/feelings/urges. Completely gone. If I hadn’t had like 7 kids to watch I think I woulda sat in the corner and cried. I cried on the way home instead. All I had to say were praises. I think God’s response was an I told you so. But I’m a rather stubborn individual and sometimes I need the push out of the plane, or the experience, or slap in the face to get me to really accept something.

compounds, such as nitrates and free radicals as well as in inflammatory processes of the body which are also associated with disease. Further, iron is essential for the formation of abnormal blood vessels ranging food tumors. The trick is to let the meat rest and drain the blood. Who likes rare steak can still resort to another trick: eat a food rich in calcium (such as yogurt desert) or a calcium supplement at the end of the meal, because this element “helps counteract the action of blood on the intestinal mucosa,” explains David Khayat. When the question are the white meats such as pork, chicken and turkey, the French oncologist has no doubt that is not implicated in cancer (from that drain the blood and remove the skin fat). The same is true for the eggs: “From the point of view of the risk of cancer are neutral. Eat what you want, do not hesitate.”

Her reverie was interrupted as her father opened the door and deafening music exploded into the house and, quite possibly, the neighborhood. As if propelled by a tidal wave of sound, Morris stumbled into the living room and demanded a limo ride to the airport.
I think the real danger for America though is Marxism on the rise. I am not sure if that can be averted at this point, due to various factors. Sure, there's the often hoped-for reset / collapse / implosion, and that is a real possibility, but there is also the very real possibility of a slow slide.
2. I Had the Craziest Dream
I’ve spent 3 days staring at this heart rate print out. Praying for 150.
Soulless is the first book in the Parasol Protectorate series, which is an enjoyable melding of Urban Fantasy, Romance, Humor, and a good helping of Steampunk. We are dropped into a world where the Supernatural has been engrained in society since the Renaissance when Vampires and Werewolves were made public. The premise comes from the idea that Supernatural creatures are long lived so that they have been affecting society for quite a long time. These Supernaturals are now afforded a certain level of class and accrued wealth because of the length of their lifetimes as happens with old money families.

We began working on the largest koi pond first.
But all these dramas were facilitated by the F.B.I., whose undercover agents and informers posed as terrorists offering a dummy missile, fake C-4 explosives, a disarmed suicide vest and rudimentary training. Suspects naïvely played their parts until they were arrested.
This was an intelligent, often gut-wrenching film. Give yourself a quiet evening at home to watch it, as the pace is unhurried and its full force is best felt when you're matching its leisurely wavelengths. Subtle, powerful, gorgeous. Highly recommended.
March 16th, Beaumont Club, Kansas City, MO….the crowd has already gone nuts several times for the opening bands and now they await patiently for the main event, the headliner….Whitechapel. Set up takes awhile and the stage opens up big for the 6 monsters from Knoxville, Tennessee, allowing them to perform and move about without bumping into one another. Lights are set up, tones are checked and the lights go out. The fog machine spews obnoxious amounts of steam into the faces of the crowd and dimly a blue light barely illuminates the stage and the 5 gents up front walk towards the end of the stage and Ben Harclerode sits down at his kit. The beginning of Section 8 begins to play and then slams into it hard just like how the song is done on the EP. The Recorruptour has come and now the main event is owning the crowd, forcing them to headbang, scream and mosh like crazy.

Chari was the mentor of the team, if such a hierarchy existed!
Charlie has become really good friends with a girl named Diane. (With one "n") I mention her because she was the first person I called. No. I've never met her previous to this phone call. But. Charlie was going to be stuck at work until evening so she offered to take me into SOHO shopping. Who can resist an invitation like that? After hearing a description of her, we agreed to meet for lunch at a place called Rubys.
You have to wonder if Grim Natwick, the man responsible for Betty Boop at Fleischer’s, animated the imaginary hula girls. The only people to get credit on these cartoons was Iwerks, Powers and musical director Carl Stalling (one wonders if Stalling’s was contractual).
I’ve been focusing on telling the stories of my maternal grandmother, Edna Buckman Kearns, in a blog and web site called Suffrage Wagon News Channel. It’s not only the original stories gleaned from my grandmother’s papers, but I’m making a bridge between Edna’s times and today. It’s about how we can build leadership today by telling stories of the suffrage movement. I have storytelling in my bones. I believe it’s a human trait going back to the beginning of recorded time and before.
I once heard a story about him. When he was no longer needed, some people adopted him and took him into their home. One night when the owners were out, a burglar broke into the house. But as he was about to leave, Clarence wandered in.
The only problem I have is with a back-carry. I really struggle to get Nookie into it on my back by myself, because of the placement of the clasps to fasten it. And it pulls a little on my shoulders. When she was smaller I didn’t wear her on my back often, so it wasn’t much of an issue. But now she’s bigger, I can barely see where I’m going if she’s on my front, so I tend to prefer to have her on my back. I still use it for front-carries, but I needed a different sling for a back-carry. And given my earlier success with Mei Tai’s, I decided to go back to those. Which leads me to my newest sling…

I’ve recently “Liked” some new Facebook pages related to History, some specifically about Women’s History, and through these have discovered some wonderful resources that I want to highlight.
The significance in the event lies in the fact that it is the first global celebration of storytelling of its kind, and has been important in forging links between storytellers often working far apart from each other. It has also been significant in drawing public and media attention to storytelling as an art form." (Wikipedia)At this point you will have to decide here whether I have been telling you a tale about the eggs or not.
Or perhaps the shades of the shaven men, whose spoil is in his house,
Union Rags shipped from Keeneland to Barn 42 at Churchill Downs on Thursday and showed a lot of energy in his 1 1-2 mile Friday gallop under exercise rider Peter Brette. Matz said, “He’s been amazing. The further he goes, the stronger he gets.”
The only thing that is steering me away from being 100% all over his stuff is Ryan. I honestly want him to love his room and his clothes and his books and his... whatever...

The only problem I have here is that for some reason the author thinks that the New Testament descriptions of worship are devoid of sacrificial imagery and that the Old Testament is only about sacrifice. In my estimation, one cannot really see such a clear cut dichotomy—especially as it relates to the New Testament.

Bang Bang Machine fall into that category of bands that are remembered predominantly for one song. Geek Love is a good song but I think that it is revered much more than it deserves. Their debut album Eternal Happiness will be under the spotlight.

Heat together the milk, butter and water in a saucepan until just about warm.
EFP11 is the beer made by Brewdog shareholders, at the Equity for Punks brewday in May. It's a 7.1% black IPA, dry hopped and aged on oak chips for a while as well. It certainly is black. Initial taste reminded me of old punk, but as it warms slightly in the glass it mellows to a really well balanced IPA. I think it's really good stuff, and its a shame it's only available to Equity Punks, and in Brewdog bars.
Fresh, fragrant and fast.
“Would you be prepared to remove the curse if the clown apologised for his earlier misconduct?” I asked.
The real deal is that world did not deserved a great and noble warrior as karna. His defiance, fight against odds, anger, philanthropy, courage, hunger for knowledge, honorable conduct, devotion to teacher and loyalty towards friend, all are traits for deep admiration. The world never recognized while he was alive his greatness. In corporate world there will be karnas who will keep on doing their duty because it shall be done, even though it means fighting against all odds. In the end they may or may not get RESPECT for their efforts.
So where can this show go from here?
At Vespers yesterday afternoon the proper antiphons, Ego plantavi etc., were sung with the psalms from first Vespers of the Common of Apostles (Pss. 109, 110, 111, 112 & 116). The chapter, hymn, versicle & response, antiphon on the Magnificat and collect were all proper to the feast. After the collect of the feast commemorations were sung of St. Peter the Apostle and then the preceding Office of St. Timothy. At Compline the Dominical psalms were sung.
My mind is doing the math. Preparation equals pressure. My senses are uneasy. The anticipation is just like me – growing heavier and heavier by the day. Another sleepless night up ahead.

I ended up using the clock face in this set for my "canvas" - stamping it with Ranger Distress Ink in Antique Linen. From there, I stamped the other elements on my clock (from the Butterflies and Blossoms set) and then stamped a second time on a piece of Flourishes Classic White paper, so that I could cut them out and pop them up a bit.
As a result of this small success, I am a big believer in writing goals.

I wished the center wreath applique was as wide as the side appliques from Do It Yourself Chic. Unable to find one online I made one out of craft foam board and fake flowers. Nail a few brads into the area, hang your form to verify placement.

The Diamondbacks won’t sign me up as their star pitcher; maybe the Cubs will offer a contract? I was aiming at my husband. The sock-ball zinged over the breakfast bar and punctured the lampshade. Breakfast bars are great places to throw things over, but it’s important to make sure that all breakables are put away.
I apologize for not getting content out thus far this week. It’s finals week here at university, and I’ve been putting my full effort into studying (read: cramming) for my exams. Oddly enough, I’ve also been dealing with an ear infection these last few days, so there’s that annoyance, too.
These insectiod people are also known as Phraint, Thri-Kreen, or Bugs. Entomalians’ four arms give them two attacks per round, and while their tail stingers do no damage, a successful hit means the victim must save versus paralyzation or be incapacitated for 1-6 turns. Like all insects, they breathe through pores in their thorax, giving unprotected Entomalians a -4 to saving throws vs. poison gas; and thick smoke will render them helpless. Technological Entomalians have a communicator implanted in their foreheads in the shape of their empire’s symbol, giving them effective telepathy with a half-mile of one another. Weapons include a short-range laser pistol (100 yards, 2-20 points) and a heavy laser rifle (1000 yards, 5-50 points). There is a 1 in 6 chance that a group of Entomalians will be accompanied by 10-40 sporgs (spiderlike organisms with 1-4 hit points, AC 8, move 120 feet/turn, damage: paralyzing stinger as above).

Mohd Haijan Omar, who was assigned by Lawyers for Liberty to monitor the event was beaten up by the Police. If even the officers of the Court are not immune to police brutality, then what chance does an ordinary member of the public has against a police force out of control?

I can see why people drop their cases sometimes. I ended up with a stipulation in our divorce that neither of us would come into contact with the other or try to contact each other or communicate with each other. That is all that I ever wanted – hard to believe that it took a year of negotiation to get to what I was asking for all along.
In the majority of aquafarms, however, these drugs and additives, which quickly build up in the sediment, -will invariably find their way into our food stream. In a paper published in 2002, Bent Halling-Sørensen and his colleagues at the Royal Danish School of Pharmacy noted that one such growth-promoting antibiotic-oxytetracycline-has been found in the sediment of fish-farming sites at concentrations of up to 4.9 milligrams per kilogram. These scientists are concerned that “Antibiotic resistance in sediment bacteria are often found in locations with fish farms”-and may play a growing role in the development of antibiotic resistant germs generally. Should their fears be true, aquafaming may be eroding the efficacy of life-saving drugs, argues Stuart Levy, the director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at the Tufts Medical School in Boston.

P.S. The origami cranes are my little idea and a trace of me.
As a child, I occasionally became envious of girls more athletic than I. This was before I learned to envy women’s bodies, and only envied what those bodies could do. When I became jealous my mother in her wisdom would say to me “Margaret, I bet those girls can’t sing a note”.
Saturday, 5/12: Opening day of our Farmer’s Market! I’m hitting the local seafood vendor for a celebratory fish supper (the one at the link isn’t GF/CF, but it’s just an example).
Spontaneous. I don't plan very often. On the rare occasion when I do try to plan, my artwork rises up mightily and asserts itself. Rarely does it ever match my plan. Sometime I deliberately choose techniques that will force spontaneity no matter what -- like the salt I threw on this piece. You try controlling salt as it spreads in wet paint.

However, I am a sucker for an occasion to wear a party dress.
Republicans led the fight for women’s voting rights — and the Democrats, as a party, opposed civil rights for women. All of the leading suffragists — including Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton — were Republicans. In fact, Susan B. Anthony bragged, after leaving the voting booth, that she had voted for “the Republican ticket — straight.”

Black Forest Cake always reminds me of my childhood because my mum made the best one ever and my brother used to request it as his birthday cake every single year without fail. However, doing shots doesn't remind me of my childhood at all because I had good parents. So... I guess this recipe is like combining the past with the future. Or something wanky like that. Really though - all you need to know is that these are sooo much easier and faster to make than a Black Forest Cake. Plus, what could be cooler than eating a whole (mostly liquid) cake in one mouthful? There is also something quite fun about shots which you have to chew as you take them. So, with that random group of good points about these shots, you can see that you obviously have to try them. I'm also planning Lamington Shots and Tiramisu Shots to go up at some stage in the same series.

Organizing is all over BLOGLAND this month, and I've determined to spend time getting my house in order instead of computer-ing.
IF government had been doing its job we would not need the IRS (it’s a private for-profit agency) registered in Delaware, and is not officially a part of the US government: Instead we have IRS as the collection arm of the private for-profit Federal Reserve who collects taxes that go straight to the owners of the Federal Reserve, in exchange for printing our DEBT-BASED money.
Heritage did this handy little graph to show just how totally insignificant the amount raised by the Buffett Rule would be. Once again, a visual explanation helps to explain what is not so clear in numbers.
There are two solutions: the Tea Party leadership in the House of Representatives can realize that government is important to the nation and that it’s their job to solve problems, not create them. When you finish laughing about this solution, think about the other one. Vote them out. With 25 more seats, Democrats can take back the House majority. That, too, may be improbable with the massive amounts of funding from the Koch brothers, Karl Rove, and Dick Armey machines, but it’s more likely than a Grover Norquest sycophant changing its spots.
There are some people who will feel sorry for Tera or Tericka, but a lot of readers are saying, “you make your bed, you lie in it.” Hopefully, this young lady finds some redemption soon. If not, she could always go back to her first love. This story is by far the fastest growing story.
