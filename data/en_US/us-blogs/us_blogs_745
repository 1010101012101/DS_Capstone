So, we talked about E for a bit, going over much of the same stuff we always talk about, trying to figure out effective ways of coping with his behaviors. One thing that always comes up are his crazy sleep patterns...and his need for "elbow" while he sleeps.
This is Monica, so *waves* Hi, all! I'm introducing, Monica's Mismatched Book Couple! It's a new weekly Tuesday meme here on Julie's blog and I added the exclamation point because, well, I can. :)

Gladys KNight danced to bohemian Rhapsody… why?! Who made THAT musical decision?! It was a horror show, that song is one of the greatest of all time, but Freddy Mercury never intended someone to try and win a dance competition with it. The judges were right… it was the herky-jerky tryring to find the ‘beats’ that made the dance unsuccessful.
But children DO turn out all right with spankings and not just because of their parents "other" disciplinary measures. I'm not saying I encourage spanking, but I will admit that I spank my children as a form of punishment. We don't believe in time-out.That children "turn out all right" even though they are spanked, is not a good argument for continuing to spank. Children turn out all right in spite of lots of terrible things they suffer. But that doesn't mean other children should be made to suffer the same things. And there are many kids who are spanked and suffer permanent damage because of it (in other words, they do not turn out all right). On the flip side, lots of children also "turn out all right" without ever having been spanked. If the argument works in one direction, it also works in the other.

So it was up to me and Party Time to devise the hook. As in: how do we get a hold of peoples' Credit Cards? What sort of front do we set up that people will hand over their Credit Cards long enough for one of us to get a snap of it on our phone.

In earlier articles, I have talked about how this “tuning in” feels. Every tradition speaks of the “fruits” of the spiritual life, and each emphasizes individual aspects of these fruits, but in a sense, as we embrace this “Authentic Spirituality,” we are integrating all the different points of view into one common experience.
We are educated in how to earn a living but we do not know how to live.
This process can and has happened under a gold standard. Whenever new, large, supplies of gold were discovered, the increased money supply set the business cycle into motion. The gold standard is not perfect. However, the effects of newly created money have been much more severe and much more prevalent under government, paper money regimes. It isn’t hard to understand why. Even the most productive gold mine in the world can’t create money as fast as a printing press or a computer entry.

So here we are at the end of the A to Z challenge. It wasn’t nearly as hard as I thought it might be, even with a trip to Montana thrown into the mix. I managed to post on time — well, except for yesterday. And a couple of glitches with the scheduing. And tongiht, when I’m barely going to make it by midnight. But mostly it went smoothly and I found myself with more to say than I thought I would. More interesting stuff, too, even for me.

In my rounds of San Diego food shopping, I hit several markets regularly that serve immigrant communities: Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, North African, Polish, German, Korean, Middle Eastern, and more. Turns out, around here, anyway, that recent immigrants simply haven't quite gotten the hang of Thanksgiving yet. Especially if the regular clientele's native language isn't English, German, or some other European tongue, the fourth Thursday of November is these markets is just...Thursday.

My most successful inductee to the religion of North & South is Servetus, who became the Armitage super-fan and blogger – but it wasn’t watching it with me that did it. We had a great time watching, mind you. It was late summer and school hadn’t started yet, and it was a chance to forget the hellishness of the upcoming semester.

I remember the first time I visited Johnstown. I was driving in from Pittsburgh, and it had been raining heavily. The sky was still gray and threatening, and local streams and creeks were swollen, brim-full. I mentioned this to a Johnstown resident, and his dead-serious response was, "You might not want to talk about that. We're kind of touchy about that."

Under normal circumstances, once a politician gets in, feel-good do-nothing budget items somehow remain in place. In fact, pointless yet symbolic spending is often increased in order to burnish a politician’s credentials with some constituency that needs a taxpayer sponsored hug. In the case of the Global Warming dollars, Christie seems to be saying that he doesn’t go for the expensive and wasteful bullcrap that other office-holders seem hopelessly addicted to.

The covenant given to Adam to multiply was renewed after the flood with Noah and his children after him. The Lord said to Noah: “And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying. And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you.”
Progressives are on the opposite side of those lines. Instead of being a big umbrella, Korea's progressives are more bound by shared political stance of leftist pro-democracy activists. The leading progressive party of today -- Democratic United Party, or DUP -- is strong in southwestern parts of Korea, where memories of Gwangju massacre are still quite fresh. Progressives are ambivalent or suspicious of United States, precisely because it was the patron state that propped up the murderous dictatorships of Park Chung-Hee and Chun Doo-Hwan. Progressives are more engagement-oriented with North Korea, and are suspicious of the attempts at Red Scare, a favorite tactic by the dictatorships to justify their existence.

Also, the girl that was training me at my job left early and I've learned just how much she did not teach me. It has a part of me bitter towards her if I ever happen to see her again. It's been a complete struggle at my job because I wasn't there in 2009 or 2010 when things changed, AND if someone who was there didn't keep emails as good as everyone thought she did, I'm literally in the dark with not even a half of a match. She used to say "You have to play around with it." I didn't realize until now what that "playing around" truly met. BUT things are getting better...however it's taking time to catch up. It's a challenge and hoping the better sticks for real.
By “explaining”, I refer to the rationale of using presuppositions already accepted as if they are the same as fact rather than looking for the facts that could support a thesis or argument. Here’s an example of what I mean:
And herein lies the solution.
The first surprise to me was the airport is adjacent to the main strip. Most cities are built first and then they had to squeeze in an airport somewhere outside of the city. Given the Las Vegas location in the middle of nowhere in the desert, there was plenty of space for an airport. Airport itself is ordinary, but I wanted to stay in the baggage claim area of airport and just people watch! What a diversity of people congregating here. There was a man and his son wearing slick cowboy hats and they had a special hat case carrier . I reminded myself i was in the southwest now, not northeast, where cowboy hats are haute couture. But, lo and behold! There are a couple of Staten Island guys sporting the gelled and sprayed "Jersey Shore" hair and talking on their cell phones. (Note: I did see a Snookie lookalike at one of the hotels) There were Europeans and American families, each can be distinguished by their fashion sense.

He ran, he bucked, he leaped in the air, he snorted and blew, dived at the ground and ran some more. He made quite a few laps on the end of the line and a few more after JR left before realizing, his audience was gone. When he figured that out- Kat settled into a trot for about four strides and stopped. He faced me and looked perplexed. "Where did he go? Wasn't he impressed?"

Almost two years later in October 2010, the 8,172 square foot Spanish-style pile nestled privately near the top of Nichols Canyon and dubbed by the rich and powerful Hollywood honcho as Casa di Pace—that's 'House of Peace' in Spanish or I-talian or something, dontcha know?—popped up on the open market with an asking price of $14,950,000. Despite at least one price drop the star-style property in the Hollywood Hills has languished.
Shortly afterwards, Kennan was called back to the US to brief his superiors more fully and his recommendations were finally published in the July 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs, the official journal of the CFR, as “The Sources of Soviet Conduct.” This became known as the “X” article because that’s how Kennan signed it, as there was still heated debated as to whether it would become official US foreign policy.
When I was young, my country had a financial recession. My parents were small business owners and had employees. During the recession Dad and Mum did everything they could to pay their team first and whatever was left, if anything, was for our family. My parents have amazing stories of miracle provision during that time. I remember several occasions when I came home from school to find a box of groceries on our doorstep. I watched my parents walk out their faith and trust in God. I watched them closely. And I saw the realness of God and His love and care.

But, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, simply using obvious brute force renders the whole activity rather pointless. Because this method is so easy, it’s also deeply unimpressive. Anyone can bend a spoon, after all – but it takes someone quite special to be able to bend a spoon with only the power of their mind.

And Ratner allowed Kassoum Fofana, whose family was left homeless by a fire, to live in a rent-free apartment in a building Ratner owns in the AY footprint, and will let them relocate into the project. “To this day, Mr. Fofana has not met Mr. Ratner,” Caldwell said with admiration. A smiling Fofana appeared near the podium and waved to the crowd, earning warm applause. Bruce Ratner did not.

A while later I walked down through the inky dark wood, across their paddock shrouded in grey dusk, and came upon a beautiful tableau. The night was closing in, and everything was dark, but in front of their house was a small golden pool of lamplight. In the pool of light, on a bed of hay lay Michelle, huge, serene and woolly. Ruth, our neighbour sat next to her, calmly holding her head. It was a scene of such timelessness, such serenity, there was an ancient energy of motherhood and love that struck me very deeply.
The show wouldn’t be my cup of cocoa whatever the nature of the reading material. When I pay 20 dollars for a seat at the theatre, I like to see action as well as dialogue. The only kinetic activity in ‘Naked Girls Reading’ is the flapping of lips, the wagging of tongues and the fingering of pages. The girls should be utilising the rest of their bodies to justify the admission price.

Well, this was the third incarnation for this yarn. First, after two solid months of knitting, it became the epic Behemoth. Then, I tried to make a top-down version of the same pattern. By some quirk of the gauge changing between knit fabric & frogged yarn, this turned out too small for DH. The 3rd plan was to keep knitting until it was long enough for a dress.
Hello all! My name is Amanda Haugen and I am currently the Floor & Crowd Entertainment Captain for FTK. This past year in FTK has been a whirlwind of meeting amazing new people, learning the ins and outs of how the FTK Dance Marathon is planned, and most importantly, witnessing the dedication and determination that each member of this organization has to the Kids. I was first introduced to FTK when the Communications Committee came to my high school to recruit Dancers for the 2011 FTK Dance Marathon. (Let’s just say I was sold by the words ‘dance marathon’.) Before I knew it, I was signed up and excited to commit myself to 12 hours of dancing, aka one of my favorite past times, and raise awareness for a great cause. However that day, unbeknownst to me at the time, ended up changing my life in the best way possible.
I began by quickly peeling and dicing the winter squash. The trick is to peeling a hard winter squash is to use a really good vegetable peeler. Once your squash is free of its tough skin, halve it, and grab a spoon to scoop out the seeds and the stringy mess inside.

Just so you know, it is my religious belief that sex is to be within the bounds of marriage. And even if I do come to the conclusion that it would be o.k. before God to divorce him, or even if I divorce him anyway and settle my conscience later, I’m still looking at a long, long time before there is even a chance of having sex again. In the state where I live, it is a year from the time the divorce papers are signed until it the divorce is formal. So, let’s say I signed papers today (which I am not ready to do, but let’s just say), it is one year until I am free. And then is there any one else, even if I am free to remarry before God, or, again, if I do it any way and settle my conscience later? And if there is someone else, how long would that be?
“Indeed,” Drahzen said, clearly not upset at all, “Now, I am aware that you will be very busy preparing your staff for tomorrow’s session, but I need you to do me a favor.” Lorovic frowned, and responded with a noncommittal grunt, which the Senator clearly took for agreement. “I’ve sent you a list of certain senators. It would be very beneficial for me if those senators were somehow barred from the Senate Hall tomorrow, even if only for a few hours. I’m sure that, as Director of Security, you would be able to come up with some way to keep them out, at least temporarily.”

While you wait... some random thoughts.
Spotting Karl is a game that a fashion-loving, Paris-based friend of mine likes to play. "I caught Karl today!" he often texts me, much to my dismay. (I'd love to see him too!) This is because the famous Chanel designer is easier to spot that you might think. He tends to linger around the same places in the city, so if you're lucky you might just glimpse him. Here's the secret – he reportedly lives in the upper two floors of the building on the corner of Rues des Saint-Peres and Quais Malaquais, where he loves looking out over the river and the Louvre. His bookshop, 7L, is also just around the corner on Rue de Lille (much of the stock is suggested by him), and his other favourite haunt is Librarie Galignani bookstore at 224 Rue de Rivoli. You could say hello but perhaps don't pester him. It must be painful being so famous. (As if I'd know.)
Any space that exceeds this – Piazza San Marco and Trafalgar are exceptions because they are a nexus in a large city and get filled to the right density – feels un social.
I thank you all who have kept us in your prayers. It makes a difference.

This is the inflow area of the storm, where the warm air is drawn up into the storm like a giant vacuum cleaner on the prairies. To the right, you see the updraft base, which was rushing quickly east (left, in the photo). My goal was to get to the east/west option and jam it east before the updraft base and the mesocyclone (i.e., the rotating part of the storm) arrived; the mesocyclone is a perilous thing to be driving directly under, especially in a tornado warned storm, such as this one. As I made the east/west option at Elwood, the inflow winds (winds flowing into the updraft of the storm -- i.e., the vacuum cleaner winds) were quite strong and actually rocking the car, and I drove through a few waves of what chasers sometimes call "atomized rain" -- a very fine mist that makes the senses perk up a bit as it seems to pop up from time to time near tornadoes. A little hotfooting on highway 23 and I got enough ahead of the storm to snap a few photos:

I would choose character development. I would want to be able to develop characters so real that you feel like you know them (or like I do when I read a GREAT story, feel like I am them- or could be). I would also choose it because when you have great characters, some of the story writes itself.

In an earlier dark age, authoritarian monarchies partnered with authoritarian religious institutions. When the world exited from this dark age and entered the Enlightenment, there was a burst of energy. Much of this revitalization had to do with risking skepticism about authoritarian and corrupt institutions and regaining confidence in one’s own mind. We are now in another dark age, only the institutions have changed. Americans desperately need anti-authoritarians to question, challenge, and resist new illegitimate authorities and regain confidence in their own common sense.
Wiest is the key component of Kaufman’s film: it’s all her (in the way that Inland Empire could actually be about Grace Zabriskie’s visitor - due to one telling late shot in that film - more than it's about Laura Dern’s Nikki/Susan.) Wiest plays her triple role with subtly affecting shifts in tone. The beauty of her performance(s) is how she underplays each mournful angle of the women she’s portraying; there’s an uncanny sadness, hinting at something more, right from her first scene. Despite her fragmentary moments, Wiest makes each one matter for the brief amount of time she’s on screen. Things get very blurry and indistinct indeed, but she guides us through Kaufman’s head-scratcher casually but regretfully, gently evoking all the feeling that the earlier parts of the film lay in place for her. Now, I don't know about Caden, but if Kaufman and Lynch could just hook up and make a mind-warping movie with Wiest and Zabriskie as a pair of bizarre, neighbourly cleaning ladies I’d die a happy man.
The next fifty billion people that Cupid would hit would be in the heart. His accuracy would rival that of the man-gods themselves when they'd hurl disasters upon the globe. He would search for Cyberon for centuries and not find him until he stumbled upon Noghin Nonagon. During that time, he'd cause humans to love and hate each other by shooting the very arrow that he had accidentally missed with right before his brother's demise. Each time it hits someone, a bit more intensity adds to the weapon. This is why there seems to be more urgency to love lives these days.All but the last single Dragon, that is. He hovered far below Noghin Nonagon, laughing at Cupid's latest attempt to find him.

Why are these steps taken or why are they heading towards this direction?
Otherwise the rich of this world are blessed of God and the poor are cursed. Consider, if you will, the Lords’ appraisal in Mark 12:42-44. “And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites…and he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury; For all they did cast in of their abundance, but she of her want did cast in all she had, even all her living.”

In their struggle to maintain racial minority supremacy, black civil rights leaders regularly invoke the one-drop rule. The one-drop rule states that anyone who has even a drop of black blood is considered black. The rule was once used by white racists in the South. They thought that anyone who had a drop of black blood was contaminated, so to speak. Just a drop of black blood made them both intellectually and morally inferior.

Most of the time my dreams are so crazy that it's easy to tell they aren't real. Sometimes though, they involve people I know, people from my history and what seem like normal events. Later I can't remember if that event really happened or if it was just a dream. Does that happen to anyone else?

It is pretty obvious that everything we have tried along these lines is failing: the education system is a disaster, and providing social services makes us feel better but has little practical effect.

If you know me IRL (as the kids say), you know that I'm a haggard, frazzled, stressed person at the moment. The phrase "I have a lot going on" was what I was telling myself 5 projects ago.

The Doctor knew that one day he would kill Violet. His companions always turned on him in the end. He had killed his last companion, the genetically engineered super-soldier Jameson Bourneville. Jameson had been useful, but he proved to have too many moral qualms. He might have been created to be the perfect assassin, but he did not have 900 years of experience of travelling time and space. Nobody, no matter how powerful could ever thwart the Doctor.

I suppose it came to me while I was walking the dogs. We have two of them, both lively and requiring a lot of exercise, so I spend a good deal of time out in the countryside around my home, in all weathers, alone with my spaniels and my thoughts. It’s actually when I’ve done a lot of my best ‘writing’ over the years, for all that I carry no notebook or pen: I’ve constructed dialogue, solved log jams in plots, and reached understandings of my characters’ motivation.

What's more, she has used one aspect of The Swimmer to inform the film that she made for the Venice Biennale. The novel, which features a plot about a Sri Lankan immigrant, is used to complement the horrific footage of brutal attacks by the Sri Lankan army on the Tamils during the civil war. The found footage is intercut with the new film, shot on iPhone to merge with the raw images of the massacre.

I suspect that the main objectors to this argument today will be the progeny of the logical positivists. Thus, the controversial premise, in light of the project of Naturalized Epistemology, will be not the first premise, but the second premise. The objector will either say that what Lonergan refers to as the ‘real’ is without empirical referent, or else that the real is not completely intelligible.

Battle Mechanics: Players will encounter a wide range of battlefields as they progress through the game. Each of the 17 kingdoms has a different type-themed battlefield. For example, in the fire-themed kingdom of Ignis, players can battle around lava flows, lava beds and fire spouts. Strategically using water-type Pokémon to navigate through this battlefield will help players conquer this kingdom. Additionally, players can use the kingdom training grounds to train their army or find wild Pokémon and link with them. After battling with a Warlord, the game automatically registers them. Using the built-in local wireless features of Nintendo DS, players can use their registered armies to battle with friends who also own the game.
It is true that some sections of the native community are adopting these new cultures, but that is only because it is here and promoted, whilst our own culture is disparaged and downgraded. The media, especially the music industry has spent forty years fanatically promoting so called “gangsta” culture, and music so much uglier, crueller and less spiritual than our own. Is it any wonder that our society has become uglier, more cruel and less spiritual, that our children are now in danger the moment they step onto the streets, and that those same streets periodically explode in fire and rioting.

In other words: Habermas’s argument is a strategy for ignoring Biblical critics outside the mainstream, by padding the universe from which his meta-analysis is drawn with Christians. At its core, Habermas can tell us what Christians believe, but not what actually happened. I expand on this immediately below.

As soon as the intro is over, we hear a sound of a kid being thrown into a locker (yeah, I can identify that sound…) and we see a blond girl pushing a kid against a locker and forcing him to apologize for saying she’s aggressive and making him say she’s pretty and sweet. *looks over the shoulder then whispers* SHE’S BOTH!!

The exile treads the divide like a shadow, never feeling utterly at home in one world or the other. Whatever is written and in whatever language the hope is that the expression is universal.

He took another long sip off his drink. He didn’t like setbacks and these bumps in the road were definitely setbacks. This Dr. Morales better not be a problem. He didn’t want to have her killed, too. He didn’t need a body count adding up. Body counts alerted cops and cops sniffing around anything was never good. The Hamilton case would never be solved. The henchman who had taken care of the doctor was good at taking care of problems. He’d proven it when he had been involved with the Petersen fiasco. The young man had orchestrated the whole thing. A job well done.
Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.
No one has felt the sting of unemployment as sharply as those just entering the workforce. So many individuals did what they were told. They went to college and worked hard. Then just as they were about to make a difference and start the jobs that would help them pay back the debt accrued while pursuing that education, the economy crashed. Droves of people were laid off, and those who would have otherwise retired were forced to remain employed as their savings dried up. As a result, so many college graduates have been forced to move back in with their parents and have been stuck working part-time jobs and are nowhere near starting the career they were promised. If this trend is ever going to be reversed it will require government investment that awards companies who hire this emerging workforce and invest in preparing them for the 21st century. Something less likely to happen if the young voters of this country do not stand up and have their voices heard.

Back to the jam session....I took out blackberries to thaw last night. I will label what I made yesterday and put it away. Today, I plan to go work out with my girlfriend sometime. She is off today, as well, so we will go during the day instead of after work like we normally do. I also need to make a run to the grocery store...maybe. That can wait until tomorrow, since I am also off then.
Studies show that the less confidence a student has, the more likely they are to be bullied. The more confidence a student presents, the less likely it is that bullying will occur. They continued to practice the steps of TFT until they learned the sequences well enough to do them throughout the week whenever they felt like fighting, felt scared or felt less confident.

Tea – a hot cup of tea, with some local honey makes a great treatment for most common ailments, like colds and allergies. Not only is tea full of antioxidants, But you also get some therapeutic benefit from the steam and the heat of the beverage. Throw in some lemon and you get a boost of Vitamin C. Sometimes a green tea is warranted but other times a hibiscus tea is a better choice. Hibiscus based teas, like Celestial Seasonings Zinger teas have more vitamin C than per cup than orange juice.

I loved working for Darcee and Thomas!! She was one of the most trusting brides to create for. We had just done Thomas' brothers wedding earlier this year and she was very confident we'd get it right. That kind of confidence makes it so fun to work for the bride....why...well, because I want to prove her right! We created new centerpieces for her using massive grapewood pieces and another style was designed to match the charming rustic wood cake stand. The Wall at Castle On The Lake was designed as never before, abounding with vivid fall blooms. The aisle was covered in scads of rose petals and the walkway arches had yards of fabulous brown taffeta with huge florals. Everything we do at La Tee Da is created with a desire to set us and the bride apart. I don't want to be like all the other florist and thankfully Darcee was willing to let us create. How much fun we had!!! Many thanks to Darcee, Thomas and the Ables family!!

“Do not affect those lives of the Saints in which the supernatural and marvellous predominate. The devout imagination becomes inflamed by such reading and is imbued with vain and useless desires: it leads some to aspire to the revelations of Saint Bridget or the raptures of Saint Joseph of Cupertino, others to imitate the mortifications of the Stylites; and thus by losing time in desiring extraordinary graces, they neglect, to their great detriment, ordinary duties and real obligations. Take great care, then, not to allow yourself to be absorbed in those wonderful characteristics of the saints which we should be content to admire; give preference rather to their simple and interior virtues, for these alone are imitable for us.”

Margarine isn’t a bad example for building a case against nutritionism; it’s probably the best one there is. While I think that Pollan somewhat overstates the role of nutritionism in pushing margarine into the mainstream (mainly by understating the importance of wartime butter shortages and lower prices to margarine’s success), it has become sufficiently clear that the nutritional establishment erred in recommending that Americans consume trans fats.

I am not one for hundreds of acquaintances who I call 'friends' simply because I pass them in the local supermarket once a month and I certainly won't call someone whom I might share a cup of tea with every six months and talk about the weather with a 'friend'. So, yes, It would seem I am fussy after all. But that is because I like to really and truly invest in people. I love my friends. I love some of them like they are my own family. I love meeting up with people I haven't seen for months at a time only to start talking at hundred miles an hours as though we have never spent a day apart.

Why is this so important you might be asking, well the simple answer is this number is the limit of social networking as in concept we could be linked to the world and therefore the world to us. However with this limit, it means this might not be the case as the “social fabric” won’t be able to support the depth of connections needed. In addition, it also can mean there will be breaks in the social chain which cannot be solved by the law of large numbers as if “I” don’t Facebook, then there will be 150 unique connections that won’t be made, which means this flaw will cascade throughout the chain (aka social fabric).

I used a pattern I got in the Sew Weekly UK meet-up pattern swap. It's the lovely Style Print 1283 pattern that Charlotte brought to the meet-up. This is my first time using a Style Print pattern. On the back of the pattern it reads "Style Patterns Ltd: An entirely BritishProduction" (emphasis orginal)! The pattern paper is a bit thicker than normal tissue pattern paper--which I found easier to work with.
I find this whole GMO argument wildly confusing. People like Barry Estabrook who wrote the book Tomatoland (I therefore love him) is very much against them. Michael Pollan is not a big fan either. Yet, in almost every anti-GMO argument I read, there was so much anger toward companies like Monsanto written into them, that I wasn't sure if it was the product itself or the greed of the company causing all the trouble. Because I'd also heard that Monsanto had made some type of "Golden Rice" that allowed poor farmers to get more beta-carotine into their diets. Genetic engineering is responsible for the huge yields that GMO-corn farmers can get on their land. It allows us to spray fewer pesticides by putting anti-pest genes into things like the New Leaf Potato.
With a packed flight I offered to be that girl who gets stuck next to the screaming baby. Mostly eating and sleeping…very little crying. But the best part by FAR was grandma and mom singing preschool songs at the top of their lungs. I laughed and they let me in on the fun but I must admit I was laughing from hysteria I believe.
I usually spend a few obsessive weeks trawling the net, chucking money down the Amazon drain, devouring all the information I can on the subject and adapting my life to be totally devout and then someone, somewhere flips the switch and it’s on to the next thing.
I'm not sure how it happened...but my beautiful, angelic looking (notice I refer to the appearance of an angel, not an actual angel)little girl changed before my very eyes. She became this mouthy teen trapped in a 1st grader's body. After a couple of warnings, I placed her in the dreaded time out chair. Then the agony that all mothers experience at least once in a lifetime (I say that tongue in cheek because if this happened to any mom ONLY once....the offer is now on the table to trade kids)...my daughter THREW DOWN one heck of a tantrum. The time out chair is in the dining room so that she is rather isolated ( i.e. Super Nanny)and I was in the other room and I am sure that the people on the next block...past our church, which is RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO OUR HOME....the parsonage (notice that I typed that in all lowercase because aren't preacher's kids suppose to be perfect? Total sarcasm there!) could hear my kid screaming her head off! Now...going to end that story so I can fast forward a few days to begin the story of MY MOMMY MELTDOWN!

Obligingly, she did so. We could hear it vibrating, but, to our dismay, it sounded like it was somehow inside the washing machine. Well, that was impossible, since if it had been, it would no longer be working, considering the inaugural laundry we had just run through it. But maybe it was behind it. Maybe it had fallen out of a pocket one of the times I was climbing back and forth. I didn’t remember having had it in my pocket, but . . . I also didn’t remember where it was at all. So we pulled the machine forward. I climbed back there. Nothing. We shone a flashlight on either side of it. Nothing. We tipped it forward and back to see if the phone had somehow gotten underneath. Nothing. Daughter kept calling it, and it kept vibrating like the tell-tale heart,
As the year goes on I switch a lot of games out and put in new games/puzzles.
I decided to change out the look of the mantle after Christmas. The candle sticks I had there before and decided to keep them on the mantle The two transfer ware plates are Staffordshire England. Since I had a nautical print on the wall above the fireplace, I thought the plates would fit right in to the decor.
this post is a toss up. i couldn’t decide if i wanted to do a what i wore thingy since i haven’t done one in, um, *cough* a while, or if i wanted to share some of my new favorite tunes. wellllll, you’re getting the best of both worlds. lucky you.
To be honest, I wasn’t even too bothered. Apparently we’re well passed any embarrassment over MY bodily functions as well.

When I arrived this is what I saw:
The envelope pictured above is a sample from Kathryn Murray, a Los Angeles based calligrapher. Her handwriting can vary from a very formal script to a whimsical font ensuring that your envelopes match the tone of your wedding. And unlike a florist or band, you can hire a calligrapher who doesn't live in your neighborhood. You can mail her your envelopes and once calligraphed she'll mail them back to you. I suggest using a mail service with a tracking system - FedEx, UPS, DHL.
The boys and I bought a pair of men's size 9 shoes for the big bro. BIG bro. Little bro fell asleep, shoe shopping is not his bag.
In conclusion, Elm Publishing is a new venture, and I feel there is a lot to be ironed out after the wash. Truthfully, Elm spawned from David Buttle’s UK Unpublished company, and I’m not convinced the strategy of creating an entirely new publishing imprint for self-published authors with a higher budget was a wise strategy at all. For me, Buttle had a winning formula that worked. This is a case of ‘if it’s not broken – don’t fix it’. What UK Unpublished needed was further expansion to broaden what it offered, not a complete sidestep away with a completely new venture.

For a long time Secret Beyond the Door was one of Lang’s most elusive titles on DVD, at least in an acceptable form. As the rights in the US now appear to reside with LionsGate it’s probably not a good idea to hold your breath waiting for anything to appear from that source. There’s been a French disc available for a while but it suffers from the old problem of forced subtitles. However, last year saw two releases that fit the bill: a budget disc from Italy and a nicely packaged edition from Exposure in the UK. Both seem to use the same transfer for the movie, but the UK release sees more effort put into overall presentation. The movie gets a nice remastered transfer with very good contrast (vital for a film like this) and only the odd speckle here and there. For extras we get an extensive gallery and filmographies. There’s also a 12 page booklet that reproduces the original poster art on the cover and contains three separate articles by David Hughes, James Oliver and Claudette Pyne. In this era of cost-cutting MOD programmes, it’s a credit to a small outfit like Exposure that they have both the will and ability to produce a thoughtful edition like this. Anyone interested in collecting classic movies really ought to consider putting a bit of business their way and support such efforts. This film tends to be glossed over somewhat when Lang’s work is discussed, probably due to the absurdity of certain aspects of the plot, but it’s actually very enjoyable. Joan Bennett gives a good performance in the lead and Lang directs with great skill and style. Anyone who is interested in film noir, Fritz Lang, or just classy 40s movies should have a copy of this in their collection.
The main difference is that Ms. Withers is not much more than a child and you, Mrs. Bourne, are old enough to know much better.

Hostile Makeover (2009) is a Canadian TV-movie starring Maggie Lawson as ‘Lacey Smithsonian’, a former crime reporter turned fashion columnist (!?), who gets mixed up in a murder case while reporting on a catwalk show hosted by an “ugly duckling” reality-TV-makeover-star-turned-fashion-designer. Phew! I won’t go into any more plot details, because the whole thing is so ridiculously dumb it makes my brain hurt… I mean, if the police had bothered to do a basic background check on all the main suspects, they would have been able to identify the killer about an hour after the actual shooting… but, yeah, whatever! This is supposed to be a “comedy”… but it’s the sort of fluffy, frock-obsessed “girly” humour that you’d expect to find in a third-rate tween flick… and seeing theses supposedly professional women get so easily distracted by fancy dresses (even while breaking into other people’s offices!), or get so giggly over guys (even when they’ve just wiped the still warm blood of a dead woman from their cheeks!), made me slap my forehead and wonder whatever happened to that “feminism” idea we were batting around a couple of years back. Shudder.

At 8:46 a.m. on September 11, 2001, the first plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center, and America woke up to the terror of jihad. I use the words “woke up” because jihad existed long before that terrible morning. And it continues to cause much of the world’s violence today.
Have you ever stood up too quickly and felt dizzy, disoriented? Maybe the room spins? Then you are familiar with vertigo or lightheadedness. It usually passes within a few minutes. Now imagine having that vertigo all day and all night.
New puppies and kittens are perfectly healthy (under normal circumstances). So insuring them right from the start saves you money over the long haul because you will be reimbursed for anything that happens to them (depending on the type of policy you have).
Macpherson refuses, significantly, to acknowledge the fact that the alleged suspects were also implicated in the stabbing of two white youths, Stacey Benefield and Lee Pearson (para, 19.36). I find the view expressed by DS Davidson that those who killed Stephen Lawrence would have been just as willing to kill a white very persuasive. It is a credit to this police officer that he, unlike some of his superiors, refused to allow himself to be intimidated and browbeaten when cross-examined by Mr Mansfield Q.C.
You still have the time factor of getting to and from the airports. Unless your intended locations are at or close to the airports, you have to add those travel times to the checkin and flight durations.
2) Halloween in general. I had a little harder time celebrating Halloween this year, given the tragic ending of the holiday last year. Also, trick-or-treating lost it's fun with a toddler who didn't understand that you couldn't knock on every single door. After about the fourth house with it's light off, the throw-your-bucket-on-the-sidewalk-and-scream tantrums got old. I mean, it's not like the kid is going to eat any of those stale Tootsie Rolls, so who were we really doing this for anyway?

Like the Carnacki the ghost finder stories you can’t always be sure that the strange events recounted will have a supernatural explanation. Mostly they do, but not always. When the explanations are non-supernatural they’re still delightfully bizarre.
When we were expecting our son, Leif, who is now two-and-a-half, I did a lot of research trying to figure out which baby products were actually necessary and which of them we could do without. As we narrowed our search, it became clear that a solid and comfortable baby carrier was essential. The Ergo website led us to Mama Goose, and now we can’t imagine raising our son without either of them.
Frankly, I did catch myself slipping into a more annoyed state. I kept thinking, why are people letting these cars turn left? Where’s a cop when you need one? I need to get home! And yes, there were obviously annoyed people on the road for whatever reason. But being in that slow moving, albeit courteous traffic gave me time to think whether an aggressive, policed, system was more efficient than a forgiving, almost parenting method. I don’t think it would have made a difference in terms of getting places sooner. I’ve noticed honking, yelling, flipping people off doesn’t seem to change the pace of moving traffic. If anything, it slows people down while they try to figure out what the problem is to the complainer. So it’s just easier for me to listen to the radio or marvel at people’s patience.
Richard believes there's a struggle taking place behind the scenes over these issues and I would offer that it remains to be seen if Obama will be the man who can refocus this country's energies on a new mission. It's interesting though that his opponent is a Mormon, who themselves are every bit as focused on outer space and sci-fi as Obama himself.
Because they’re cannibals.

A specific idea that Rolly has mentioned more than once is having faces over the fireplace that watch you and have smoke coming out of their noses and mouths (another idea lifted directly from Cocteau). It's interesting that Davis sketched an alternate version of the fireplace as seen in the first sketch. You have to wonder if Rolly's ideas were a stimulus here. Maybe, maybe not.

It was June 2011, the height of the summer and we were on a bike tour around the midlands, planning to visit a few breweries along the way. For months I’d been training, loading up my BOB Yak with all my camping gear, riding a 20 mile route every night after work and spending my weekends searching out every hill I could find, pushing the training mileage up to ~40 miles.
Im just not an assertive person...I dont like to fight with people and I don't like to come across as a total bitch..UNLESS it has to do with my husband (like perhaps beating the crap out of any woman who is trying to get "wit my man" as they say in the ghetto) or anyone who is trying to mistreat or make fun of my child! Im not afraid to be possessive when it comes to these things in other words...I can be crazy if I need to be. SO as I ponder what happened and hope that it never happens again...I think of all the good the school has done for madie...getting her lots things for free and coming across as such loving people with my girl. I have always felt as if I was bringing her to safe place.. a loving place...a understanding and patient place...Which is mainly what made me want to cry when I see that she was not noticed for simply a wet diaper. All is good now. I want to say we are ALL in a good place now. I dont ask for daily diaper changes and obsessively checking her every 5 minutes...Just make sure. ya know? I have a wonderful Hubster who kinda becomes the assertive one and is not afraid if folks hate him as long as the "shit gets done" and the wife stays happy! lol! Oh Mr Miles. xo WEll in other news...Nuero follow up went well..we discussed how she has been drop seizing quite a bit and hitting her noggin on the hard wood floors..It seems to always happen when I am not watching...she is quite the squirmy kiddo..can be sitting in one place we call the "safe zone" one minute and the next she is in what we call the "fall zone"... and CLUNK! Soooo there was talk of getting her some head gear. My dear friend Cami's Mamma gave me Camis old helmet awhile back and well..kiddos head is pretty big now! Sooo we go in Monday to get her head measured...quick and easy :) I hate helmets. I really do. Its like I know my daughter is disabled...lets make her look the part more! I am in no way trying to offend others who have to wear helmets but I guess I always had that "not my kid" thing in my head... :( It will be quite a relief at the same time to have it...so I can turn my back and say type up this earth shattering blog with no worry that she will whack her head! :D I can also do crazy things like check the dryer and wash bottles!! INSANE I know! Nuero ALSO recommended we increase her Depakote. Its been a long time since we had a med increase...like at least 2 years! Shes 5 now and I guess its time...A two week trial we will give it..and if we see no more drops that we can continue as long as she tolerates it well and is not totally drugged up. Blood work in June too. :) I hate medicines...I just hate em. I cry when I think of Madie on zero meds with zero seizures and how she could be! Stilllll 2-3 giant seizures per month....:/
3. Daniel proposed in the late evening on March 31st, so we didn't have much time to call our friends and family to tell them the good news that night. So, we ended up making most of our phone calls the day after on April 1st. That's right - April Fool's Day! Needless to say, nobody believed us. It made for some pretty funny conversations, though!

Minor complaints aside, this was a decent story superbly written. John Hansen is a young writer--teenaged, even, though I can't say exactly what age--and already has a great grasp of language and narrative flow. If I wrote as well as he does when I was his age, I'd be rich and famous by now.

Fashion design is a celebrated profession for many reasons. To name a few, it is praised for it’s extremity, creativity, originality, open-minded nature and for it’s knack for finding and producing beauty out of odd or idiosyncratic circumstances. All of this is true about fashion design, yet sadly the modeling world does not always reflect this open-mindedness. High fashion models have been notoriously exclusive to white women of a very specific height and weight range. In other words, an overwhelming percentage of working, high fashion models are tall, thin and very white. It is unfortunate that even in a unique and creativity-based industry, there are still some aspects of it that remain extremely homogeneous. However, just like the rest of the world, the fashion and modeling world is experiencing ground-breaking changes. Recently, several high fashion lines have signed on nontraditional models to represent their upcoming collections. This shows evidence of the appreciation of a new kind of beauty, the type of beauty that comes from being confident in their own differences from the rest of the homogenous world.

This entry is risky for it coming across as ‘holier than thou’ – and I am not sure how well I’ve done writing down an intensely personal process, but I also feel that even if it means that just one person looks at their belief systems a little differently, or their lives, then that would be worth it. Having your heart broken drives people crazy, I am no exception. I am not over it yet, and I still have the kind of thoughts/feelings sometimes that if put in writing would presumably have me instantly institutionalised.

● BONUS LOOPHOLE: Democrat Senator Christopher J. Dodd (D-Connecticut), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, inserted the loophole in Obama’s “stimulus” package (H.R.1) to exempt bonuses granted by contract before Feb. 11, 2009, from restrictions on bonus payments for TARP recipients:
However, in the same report, Michael Robinet, director of IHS Automotive Consulting, said that, if there were any easy alternatives to PA-12, they would already be in use.
One of the new techniques that intrigued me was small-batch brewing. One day I happened upon the Basic Brewing Video podcast and the episode “A Six-pack of IPA.” James Spencer and Steve Wilkes showed how they made a simple American IPA in a one-gallon glass jug with minimal equipment or ingredients investment. I figured I could do that. I rounded up a maple syrup jug, ordered a drilled stopper, some hops, malt extract, and yeast, found the airlock from my original equipment kit, and tried it out. To my surprise, it worked.
Comedy as a genre has always been a favourite among film audiences and films like Kadhalikka Neramillai, Thillu Mullu and Michael Madana Kama Rajan still garner good TRPs whenever they are screened on television. Till the early 2000s, each year used to have its share of half-a-dozen comedies that proved successful both with the audiences and at the box office. But, over for the last few years, comedies had been dwindling, both in terms of quality and quantity. Think of the comedy films that came out during the last five years and you will end up with a list of only a handful of films like Tamizh Padam, Boss Engira Baskaran and Kalavani.

Every military and intelligence operation has a “cover and deception” aspect. Most have several, backup stories to use if one fails, like the inflatable tanks that Patton’s “empty army” used in Britain in 1944 to fool the Germans. 9/11 was no different, the cover and deception there was to prove that a group of FBI informants, some “cloned persons,” some Israeli agents, were actually hijackers planning 9/11.

B has been asking me what I wanted for my birthday for a couple of weeks and until a few days ago I didn’t know. I don’t like birthday parties. We used go camping on my birthday, but camping these days feels like a lot of hard work. Then a couple of days ago I tried to step out of the house to check the garden and my attempts at leaving were met with Lj’s cry of “I wanna come, wait for me,” and so I waited, and then we made it out there and I assessed the drip tape situation and was ready to go back inside and there was more “wait for me, wait for me” and I realized that what I really wanted most for my birthday was to be by myself.

This week I have noticed a major decrease in my nausea. THANKFULLY!! It hasn't been awfully bad this whole time, but it's nice to start to feel like myself again. My gag reflex is still killer so I have to be careful about where I am if I need to cough hahaha. I have had a few bouts of unexpected vomiting. It's so bizarre b/c I will be feeling fine and then all of a sudden I'll be gagging running down the hallway or vomiting on my toothbrush (which I threw away). Honestly I would take this over days and hours and weeks of constant nausea. I'm just sitting back and waiting for my energy levels to return to normal and then we can get life back to it's usual pace.

They awaken into something deeper, which is no longer based on concepts in your mind. A deeper sense of purpose or connectedness with a greater life that is not dependent on explanations or anything conceptual any longer. It’s a kind of re-birth. The dark night of the soul is a kind of death that you die. What dies is the egoic sense of self. Of course, death is always painful, but nothing real has actually died there – only an illusory identity. Now it is probably the case that some people who’ve gone through this transformation realized that they had to go through that, in order to bring about a spiritual awakening. Often it is part of the awakening process, the death of the old self and the birth of the true self.
We need not fear quite just yet about those long winter evenings, although we should be planning or have planned for them. We bought some winter brassica seedlings today to put in to our new garden share plot, we should have some fresh vegetables in early February through to April whilst the main growing season crops are yet to begin to grow.

Secondly, we have to believe in the superiority of our Western values. If we do not believe in our own Western values, we will not be prepared to defend them. That is why we have to end the biggest disease in the world today, the cultural relativism which pretends that all cultures are equal. This is simply not true. Our Judeo-Christian and humanist civilization is far superior to any other civilizations like the barbaric Islamic civilization. We should not be afraid to say so. It is more free, more democratic, more tolerant than any civilization the world has ever seen.
2a. Don't think that simply because we are both on two wheels that you can split a lane with me. You can't and you shouldn't. And there is more at work here than greater mass and power vs. an exhausted vegetarian on a kids' toy. For example, if you come up from the right along beside me, YOU WILL GET BURNT-BADLY- by my exhaust. Chances are I will have sped up to get well ahead of your sweaty ass which is something I do for safety's sake( only one vehicle per lane here, Paco...that’s the law.) Therefore chances are good that I'll never know it happened. Again- this is not because I'm an asshole and don't care, although I am and I don't. It's because I am operating a motorized vehicle in a safe and orderly manner on a system of roads designed for motorized vehicles, and I am already a mile away.

A lot of people (including myself until about 5 minutes ago) Cherry Five eventually changed their name to Goblin, and found success providing the music for Italian horror films Profondo rosso (known as Deep Red in English speaking countries) and Suspiria (which is now hailed as a horror classic. They also provided the soundtrack for the Italian cut of Dawn of The Dead. As Goblin, their music was usually dark and creepy, obviously fitting the horror films they were accompanying but as Cherry Five, their music was more in line with traditional symphonic prog like Genesis and Yes, two bands that they were inspired by. A curious difference between Cherry Five and most Italian prog bands is that they had an English lead singer, taking away that usual problem when foreign bands sung in English and their thick accents take away from the lyrics.

Success! K and I have managed to deliver a perfect presentation. “That thing we did…that was…good,” I can’t resist declaring. You’d think we’d be feeling elated, but after having spent nearly every weekend for the better part of the last year preparing for this moment, what I’m feeling is a kind of post-academic project postpartum depression. Alcohol. We need alcohol, stat. The only obstacle to obtaining said alcohol is that neither K nor I are willing to purchase a $40.00 bottle of wine from the Hotel restaurant. Then, of course, there’s the problem of inquiring at the front desk where we can obtain less-than-$40.00 adult beverages without appearing a: cheep, or b: like the functioning alcoholics we most certainly are not. A gentleman at the front desk suggests an Italian eatery down the street and a seafood place behind the hotel.

Standing by the car in the parking structure, I saw what could be a perfect pictorial summary of Gloucester, with the cathedral playing a central role. So leaving the city’s aesthetic intermingling for the cathedral’s vaulted interior filled to the top with soaring vocals was like being transported to another time and place. At one point I thought to myself, “I am listening to amazing music in a cathedral in ENGLAND!” Sometimes life can be better than a dream.

Took me awhile, but I finally latched onto 2010's Poppees collection entitled POP GOES THE ANTHOLOGY that Bomp! Records unleashed on a public that we all know couldn't care less. But since the folk at Bomp! knew that and released it anyway I couldn't offer them any more kudos than possible. Along with the Planets, Best, Cross, Great Mistaque and a few dozen other groups due for an exhumation, the Poppees were part of the third-string underground New York scene, though where many of these groups drew their energies from various late-sixties/early-seventies rock movements the Poppees' credo was strictly of an early/mid-sixties vintage...mainly the early/mid-sixties Beatles back when the Fabricated Four weren't into their cosmic consciousness phase and could still belt out a Little Richard number with a surprising amount of conviction. Even with this retrogarde stance the Poppees were able to make a dent on the local scene, at least enough that various local critics could point to 'em as if they had just made some sort of big discovery worthy of Columbus..."hey, look at this new rock group I discovered all on my lonesome...they're so great, and while you're at it NOTICE ME for discovering 'em as well!!!"

Although I do not wish to go into the whole issue of the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, as I personally do not think that there were any real victors in that miserable war, I do however believe that the following words by an independent observer, namely Dr Chester Crocker, who was the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs at the time, briefly sums up the true state of affairs, and clearly highlights the fact that the Russian-supported Cuban/Fapla forces were definitely NOT the victors of this battle:

As a member of Influenster, I often get the opportunity to try out great products for free. Most recently I received the new Gillette Venus & Olay razor before it hit the shelves! While having soap surrounding razors is not a new thing, Gillette has combined the Venus 5 blade razor with Olay. I Love this! I am a fan of Olay and have always loved how soft their soap makes my skin. Not to mention I'm lazy and one less step in my shaving routine is fantastic. Being able to just wet the razor and apply it to my skin is great, the five blades combined with Olay has given my legs a super close shave and left my legs silky smooth.

Sandler plays the title character, a drunken, dumb slacker--surprise, surprise--why agrees to repeat elementary through high school in order to prove to his mogul father he can handle taking over the hotel chain. His nemesis is a pre-Josh Lyman Bradley Whitford. If you are wondering what Whitford is doing in a film like this, so was I. Believe it or not, there are traces of Lyman in the character. He is a sharp, intelligent guy who arrogance allows him to at times be cruel. Here, the character is exaggerated for comedic effect, but that is Lymon all over.

After two consecutive gap up openings, the market had a gap down opening today. Lots of trading done overnight. The pullback from yesterday’s high was 10 points. This could be part of an ABC up from SPX 1365, or the start of Intermediate wave C. With some key economic numbers tomorrow, and options expiration on friday, we should know quite soon. Short term resistance is now at the OEW 1386 pivot and SPX 1397, with support at the 1372 and 1363 pivots. Short term momentum is currently around neutral. And, short term OEW charts have a positive bias with the swing point SPX 1383. Best to your trading!

You think in the moment, but you fail to take into consideration the event that caused you to get into that unfortunate situation to begin with, you fail to see the outcome of your actions.

From the moment his mother had seen him walk into the house with his shoulders straighter than usual, she knew something must have happened, he had this puzzled look on his face, but by jolly he had a spring in his step never before seen. His mother baited him with questions and he acted dodgy at best but when he finally let the cat out of the bag, her heart sang in joy, she was glad, but she did not show it you see, she was Irish. She requested her son to bring over said woman, so that the woman could meet her. She had a few words of wisdom she knew she had to impart onto the couple. This she felt sure about, This was the fact that her son’s life had finally found meaning, had finally found purpose, and how long she had wished this for him, well silently of course, she did not want the husband finding out that she entertained fantasies of bliss in her head, that would be fool hardy.
One of my most politically liberal friends read this book and declared his world view to be transformed. Not that he was no longer a liberal but now “he couldn’t be so rude about the other side, because I understand where they’re coming from.” This will be music to Haidt’s ears as the book was written partly as an antidote to the more polarised American politics of the past 20 years, marked by the arrival of Bill Clinton and the liberal baby boomers onto the political stage.

Yet Scilla can’t seem to wrest Willow—or herself—from a path of self-destruction.

If the believer is intelligent and even minimally informed, he knows that Islam will be unable to overthrow the West by force of arms for the foreseeable future. For the infidel to be completely and permanently vanquished, the victory must be accomplished through quiet, unobtrusive means. Educated believers who are well-versed in the ways of the West are invaluable for these purposes. They must propagate soothing, sophisticated rhetoric that lulls the infidels and keeps them unaware of any threats to their cultural hegemony.

As vaudeville began to wind down, Robinson was one of the lucky and talented few who not only kept working, but who actually became more famous. He starred in a number of revues, such as “Blackbirds of 1928” and “The Hot Mikado”, performed in top nightclubs in Harlem and elsewhere, and co-starred in numerous movies with the likes of Will Rogers, Lena Horne and – most famously – Shirley Temple. A variation of his stair dance can be seen in the Temple-Robinson vehicle “The Little Colonel” (1934).

The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, gives sole responsibility to the House of Representatives for originating and approving appropriations and taxes. Who is the speaker of the House? John Boehner. He is the leader of the majority party. He and fellow House members, not the President, can approve any budget they want. If the President vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to.
I'm not so naive to believe that we have a complete freedom of religion in this country. I'll even concede that there is a certain amount of religious speak within the formative documents of our country and that many of our founding fathers were representing some form of religious moral values in creating the laws from the outset and moving forward. However, the founding fathers, regardless of their personal religious perspectives, explicitly wanted to create a separation between church and state, and create a freedom of religion. A freedom of religion means the express right to practice freely whichever religion or lack thereof that one might choose; and separation between church and state being the unequivocal declaration that no specific religion should dictate the positions of our politicians or policies. The specific documents that these ideas were included in are moot, but the fact that the founding fathers had such foresight in creating them is not in dispute.

Why else is it necessary? It is, as the wonderful Elizabeth Warren reminds up, part of the social contract. Making vast sums of money requires the support (willing, intentional, or otherwise) of the whole of society. Paying that back is a reasonable request. It is also true that income inequity forces a larger tax burden on households headed by women and people of color. Of course the loudest voices in the Republican party disagree. The Ryan budget does nothing to address this inequity. Candidate Romney, who refuses to share more than one year’s worth of his tax papers with the country he wants to lead, is also a vocal opponent. Anti-tax goblin Grover Norquist, of whom many Republican legislators live in fear, is adamant in his opposition.

Christ’s Spirit urges us, “Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 John 2:15). One’s cravings, entertainment, and recognition will all hopeless die and pass away. “And the world is passing away, and the lust of it” (1 John 2:17a). People love the distraction of these worldly things from the reality of endless guilt.

** I did find it interesting that after she told me the cream wouldn't do anything, I proceeded to spot for an entire day after the appointment. Not sure if the pap can cause that (it hasn't ever before), or if my sudden lack of applying the cream that week had actually caused something to start happening. I had used the cream for about 10 days, and stopped only because I didn't want to have my period during my pap appointment. Not like it matters at this point, though... I'm almost done with these pills.

PSYCHOLOGY: ANOTHER BUNDLE OF LAUGHS
The crooners’ combat intensified when Bob Weitman, manager of both Paramount theaters, booked Columbo into the Brooklyn Paramount. This clever maneuver deliberately coincided with Crosby’s engagement at the New York Paramount. Columbo opened at the Brooklyn Paramount on Nov. 26, 1931, and played there for 10 weeks, until Feb. 10, 1932. The newspaper ads touted the initial program as “a gala anniversary show crowning the achievements of three years as Brooklyn’s leading theater.” Sharing the bill during his run were Frances Faye, The Boswell Sisters, The Mills Brothers, and George Burns and Gracie Allen.

McDonald’s pitch-black sarcasm and rare willingness to talk bluntly about things most TV personalities are reluctant to even skirt are missed, especially now, in an era where TV comedies like Louie, Eastbound and Down, and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia are finally making his style of humor fashionable. There have been rumors for several months of a pilot deal with FX, and I can only hope that somehow comes to pass. Or, failing that, Conan O’Brien could at least do Norm and all of America the courtesy of booking him often on his new TBS show.
5. Why do nonbelievers consistently find smug satisfaction in pointing out the ‘hypocrisy’ of Christians who sin (eg. the online news comments regarding the recent SS prostitution scandal)? If content in never being hypocritical, doesn’t that equate to never aspiring toward goodness? Should people always choose the natural (sin) route simply because that is more consistent with ‘who they really are’?

Such ecological and financial insanity continues because the crony-capitalist minerals-energy complex remains intact.

Karma accumulates, and it does not go away at the end of a physical life. You can balance it out with actions born from sincerity, as opposed to ‘good deeds’. What this means, is you don’t get rid of karma, by saying, “I’m going to do good stuff and help old ladies.” and expect that to work. Because you have to be sincere and it MUST be a true expression of your soul.

In Columbus' second game against the Flemington Neshanock BBC, the Capitals came roaring back to tie the match at eight aces all, heading into the final frame. Flemington scored one time in the top of the ninth to make it a 9-8 game. Columbus tried mounting yet another comeback and would have tied the game if not for a brilliant throw from Flemington's left fielder to nail the tying ace at home. And only a perfect throw would have sufficed. As a spectator, it was an exciting way to end the match. Perhaps for the Capitals, not so much. However, their resolve and gamesmanship will never come into question here in Brooklyn.

There are two reasons why I love Friedrich Nietzsche; one is because his moustache semaphored a silent two-fingers-up to the establishment, if even unbeknown to the man himself; and two because he was bonkers. I personally find that a crazy infidel always makes for the best kind of literary idol, add booze to the mix and call him perfect. Now, I am not entirely sure about Nietzsche’s drinking habits but reading some of his work one would be forgiven for thinking he wrote while heavily intoxicated. Still, the man was a genius and a genuine sovereign thinker despite his idiosyncrasies and the inconsistencies in his oeuvre. This, however, according to many scholars, is precisely what makes him unworthy of the “philosopher” appellation but I would argue, in Nietzsche’s own words, that “one is fruitful only at the cost of being rich in contradictions”. I have always held on to that because occasionally I couldn’t hold on to some of my convictions. In other words, we change, and are changed by our experiences; therefore, inevitably, our ideas and beliefs change along with them. A sentiment that was seconded years later by William Somerset Maugham who said: “We are not the same persons this year as last; nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person.” I find this to be true both of life and, in this case, my personal feelings toward this most divisive philosopher.

He got home from class a little before 8:00 and still stopped to help me finish putting it together before eating and heading to bed. I think he knew how excited I was. He definitely got brownie points tonight. Anyway, it’s completely fabulous and I am excited to get my little drawers from the container store to finish it off. I will post a picture of my set-up on here once it is all finalized. I wish I could show it to you now, but alas I want to wait until I can show you the finished product.
“…just as certain families like the Whitney’s in the U.S. help dominate the Order of Skull & Bones.. William Collins Whitney (1841-1904) and his two sons are the core of the Whitney influence in the Order of the Skull & Bones. This Collins blood of the Whitney’s then went into the Harriman family. The Collins blood of the Whitney’s went into the Payne family and the Vanderbilt’s by intermarriage! William Collins Whitney was the power behind Pres Cleveland, who was his puppet. He also directed a group of powerful important capitalists called the Whitney Group. W.C. Whitney married Flora Payne. Their son Harry Payne Whitney married Gertrude Vanderbilt in 1896. Their son (and remember he still has Collins blood) Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney married Marie Norton who later married W. Averell Harriman (unit. into S&B in 1913), the man who helped finance Hitler to power…”
Anyway, off subject again... his swallow study went well today. We were successful in getting him to drink the liquids he needed to! We brought Dora and Cars cups from the party last night for him to drink from and the SLP added Strawberry Nestle Quick to the barium contrast. This significantly aided the ease of the procedure. But, he is still aspirating of course. Nick and I were both hoping that he was going to show that he has improved, but that wasn't the case. I always get that gut wrenching/sinking feeling in my stomach when I hear the radiologist pause and scream out... "bla bla bla ASPIRATION" lol. I just want to yell out the D word. Like she just crushed down my last ray of hope... "No, there is nothing wrong with my son you liar!" But that would be the irrational/human side of me coming to the surface. So I remain calm, introverted with my feelings and continue on as the supportive and strong mother people see me as. If they could only catch a glimpse of my heart and my mind.
So,in short, I came back inspired. I have spent the last few days in the studio working on 1 assemblage painting (wip photo on fb tomorrow) that is coming together nicely and my nights practicing my airbrushing techniques. It's really nice to feel challenged and on task.

Beluga whale. The day we went to see these guys, it was a chilly in San Diego. We had just been able to get on the splashy water ride that we had missed before and we were soaked to the bone - even after paying the $5 for the stand-in dryers. Since the beluga whale is an arctic animal, they have it in an arctic temperature exhibit. We froze. We were wet and cold and would have liked to linger much longer to gaze at these incredible whales, but we had to rush out to get warm again.
First, what is a trappist? It is a Belgian Pale Ale, defined per BeerAdvocate: Belgian Pales consume the Belgian brewing scene, and were initially brewed to compete with Pilseners during the WWII time frame. They differ from other regional Pale Ale varieties, by traditionally being less bitter, using aged hops for a delicate hop finish, and boasting sweetish to toasty malt overtones. They should be decanted properly, leaving the yeast in the bottle. This will showcase their brilliant color range from pale straw yellow to amber hues. Most will be crowned with thick, clinging, rocky white heads. Flavors and aromas will vary. Some have natural spice characters from yeast and hops, while others are spiced.

To all who got to see Mays play, tell me about it sometime. I’m very jealous. He played during a different era, one when everyone knew who was in the pennant race. He was a hero. He was at the end of a golden era of players. And he was at the beginning of an era when the business of baseball took a greater focus. It’s hard to imagine this Willie Mays playing in a game where it costs $7 for a beer, $4 for a hot dog, and every inch of the cavernous stadium is littered with advertisements.
Like I mentioned, I’ve been big on getting cheese from the remnant or manager special box at bloomingfoods. The cheeses I’ve gotten recently are goat gouda, cocoa dusted cardona, and kentucky blue cheese. The remnant section is great because it gives you a chance to try a cheese you may not normally. It also allows you to have an expensive cheese for a fraction of the cost and without the fear of it going moldy in the fridge. Plus, if you’re cooking for one, you can make a small chunk of cheese last a for a few meals. If you’ve never had cardona before, I would suggest looking for it. It’s apparently an artisanal goat cheese from Wisconsin. The creator of it got the idea from one of his favorite sandwiches- a piece of swiss cheese and a hershey bar on bread. I can barely detect the cocoa in this cheese, fortunately. Anyway, I know a lot of people are leery to buy food that is marked down to sell. I’ve never had a problem, though, and it certainly beats paying full price.

Our contractor found a great, reasonably-priced cabinet line for us from a company right out of western North Carolina.

The raw meaty bones diet is also known as the prey model diet, those who follow this diet feed their pets raw meaty bones (including oily fish), organ meat (including tripe) and eggs, some stop there, others feed raw vegetables, fruits and table scraps. All of this is in line with Tom’s recommendations, in his book Raw Meaty Bones (page 156) he recommends that for dogs raw meaty bones from a variety of animals should comprise at least 70 percent of the diet, that remainder can be cooked or raw table scraps. Within the group of raw feeders there will be those feeding 100 percent raw meaty bones right through to 70 percent.

To be a mentally or physically challenged is extremely miserable. The stigma attached to this condition and day to day problems faced by this lot is not less than a curse.

I was shocked to be out on the beach with some friends near midnight, when we came across three 13 year old girls wandering the beaches! Their families were visiting the area for Spring Break, and the girls decided to go out late at night to mingle with the crowds. Bad idea! Really, where the hell were their parents? My female friends tried to gently tell the young teens to head back to their hotel, where it was probably safer. And we walked them to their hotel, which was about 2 miles from where we we met these kids! I have to say, I was appalled that their parents would even let them out this late! 13 year old girls have no business wandering strange beaches at night, where drunk college kids and trouble makers roam and party, doing some pretty adult things.

Jeremiah faced a similar situation. He was sent to deliver God’s message to Israel. The problem was that the people who were supposed to receive the message mocked it.

The last candle was extinguished and I will admit to some trepidation as I sat in the darkness for the half-hour before onset. Would I be launched into hyperspace again? Would I find myself embarrassingly on the floor once more? When it came, it was immediate and strong. There was no mistaking the effects of entering the vision space, but I did not lose myself this time. This felt very different and I felt much more in control of myself. It was going to be OK! I could let go a little more now and enjoy the experience. With my awareness intact, I was determined to use this great opportunity to see and learn as much as possible.

So for those of you who did not know I am a noob on the blog scene I have made this post for you to point and laugh at me. As for the rest of you, please ignore this post and move on to reading my previous post (Charlie 3).
Last but not least, learning a language can create a zest for building communication skills. Individual and family dynamics may develop exponentially. Likewise, confidence and self-awareness are bolt-ons.

I WAS SURPRISED and disappointed recently to walk into one of my favourite local pubs – which in many respects is very traditional – and find they had decided to dispense with beer mats. It’s not going to make me take my custom elsewhere, but it’s another niggly little reason to feel the pubgoing experience is less than ideal.
Can we pause here for a moment?
Understand there is a fine line in the minutia of what we are writing to you today: Douche or no douche, ¿estamos claros?
Wednesday is going to be Eight-Track Tape Day, Barbershop Quartet Day (Noooo.......), International "Louie Louie" Day and National Cheese Fondue Day.
Frank went back to the trailer for J’s wife. He told her there had been an accident, and j was hurt bad. She panicked, got in the car, went out with him to the woods. There must have been a confused moment when she looked around for her husband, but he was nowhere to be seen. She must have turned to Frank in confusion. Then he exploded. The beast within came out in full rage, and he grabbed J’s wife, pushing her to the ground and tearing at her jeans. He raped her brutally, violating her in every way his lust-maddened mind could conceive, before putting his hands around her throat.
And so, as these weeks go by, whenever I am able and inspired, I will try and offer my own meditations and thoughts on this mystery of mysteries. The hope is, I suppose, to shake us from the fog and contempt that familiarity has brought with this season.

She did not answer. He did not mind the silence, it was either the silence or the sound of her heels clicking on the floor as she walked away. They stood like that for 5 minutes, her back to him. She took a deep breath, commanding her tears to stay, willing them to disappear.
“Here in America, we believe that all of us are equal and that each of us deserves the chance to pursue our own version of happiness. It’s what led us to become a nation. It’s at the heart of who we are as a people. And our history is defined by the struggle to fulfill this ideal – to build a more perfect union, to ensure that all of us, regardless of our race or religion, our color or our creed, are afforded the same rights as Americans, and the fair and equal treatment under the law.
Given the technology of the 1960s -- your phone has more computational power than all of NASA had, back then -- it's amazing they didn't blow themselves up every time. It was a perfect example of human determination and ingenuity overcoming all obstacles of technology or common sense.

We rent a seperate physical stream, in a far-off datacenter, as they have massive amounts of cheap upstream bandwidth that I do not. Is that grammatical? I can't tell! Anyhow, we simply can't host 6.4mbit of upload from a home connection. Yes, we have fiber running to within a mile of us, but they don't give us a pipe that big.
To be the people we need to be, we all need prayer enveloping us, power in play to counter and guard against every force eager to sabotage our efforts toward godliness and goodness.
What is it? Shit if I know. I had a few minutes and needed to completely unwind. Been a while since I decompressed like I have been lately. Feels nice. I need to get moving though, lots to do. Of course, last night I saw a Facebook post from a friend that completely bummed me out. Nothing about the post, in fact it was a very nice and kind post, but about the other project I was working on. The project I could still be working on, because they offered a longer gig.

I'm pleasantly surprised at how much Gail and Joan have changed and solidified their thinking since I saw them last! They were able to share some very recent research and items from their professional reading that put the Cafe system into perspective in the grand scheme of literacy. While they still believe and advocate that you can teach any strategy with almost any book, they shared with us some of their newest favorite titles (and gave us copies!)
Overall, I was quite pleased with these. Platinum Base Coat is by far one of the best white cremes I've used. I still enjoy the crackle trend and I appreciate Pure Ice doing something a little different.
Later with family commitments and so many more business demands, his photography was put aside. Although when the family business was sold, because of the impact of video and large rent increases, he set up and ran a commercial photographic and design studio. John also gave a number of lectures to various photographic societies, in the early days, explaining exactly how he achieved his results. His lectures were in great demand and he always had a good reception. Not only were most attending very enthusiastic, but even years later, hardly anyone has produced anything as interesting as his studies. John also made this information freely available on his website in his article titled ‘The Magic Lantern’.

Now onto talking about how AWESOME I am at slacking! Jokes. Sort of. I didn’t blog yesterday because I took the day off. Not from the BOOM BOX but from work, cleaning house, cooking, blogging, etc. It felt good. The kids noted that I seemed to be in a great mood! And I was indeed. I could totally do this whole stay at home mom gig. Of course I would be more productive than I was yesterday but it was good to be able to help the kids get ready without us going nutso! But I digress. I’m supposed to be recapping my WOD for yesterday and today and not going on about how I need to be a stay at home mom!

Not that you are apt to hear me say this often, but he is right. These schools need to be closed and these kids have the right to get a better quality education. Jackson on the other hand is calling it:
Having determined what you think are your most pressing needs for year 1 prioritise them. Priority items you may wish to purchase in better quality (and at higher cost) than non-priority items. There may well be items that you purchase in year 1 that you will replace by year 3. For example, let’s assume you need a whole new wardrobe because you have recently lost a massive amount of weight, or vice versa. You might choose to buy some good quality shirts and a couple of cheap suits and 2 pairs of shoes in year 1 with the expectation in years 2 and 3 to give priority to building up your suit and shoe collection. In which case you don’t mind having cheap suits in year 1 because you can improve the breed as you go on. It is a 5-year project after all.

As I wrote this week and worked on my project for TEEN GIRLS, I had an epiphany (LOVE that word!)
It is also evident that employers have repackaged or are ‘converting’ or ‘rebranding’ existing jobs as apprenticeships so as to meet targets and qualify for money. Neither is it clear how many of them may be short-term – maybe for a few months at best. Under the Coalition many ‘apprenticeships’ exist in name only and are certainly not the legally binding indentures of yesteryear that guaranteed employment on completion because again, employers, benefiting from plenty of applicants, including plenty of graduates, do not require such ‘time serving.’ The reality is that most do not require apprentices at all!

If you're wondering why the unicorn has been silent all week, that's because I have a new book out. (In case you haven't heard me shouting about it online all last month, it's over there on the right.) That means I need to tell people. And the best people to tell are those readers who might enjoy it, so I've been visiting Welsh schools to meet some of them.

Choosing a TV may simply be a trouble-free decision for some, but finding the perfect LCD TV could be challenging and demanding. This is the kind of TV where you will spend a big amount of your cash and where you will be getting big amount of entertainment. So better check these guidelines to ensure that what you will buy is a perfect fit your budget, home interior, and leisure taste.
We all have to do things we don't want to do. People expect certain things of us. If everyone did whatever the fuck they wanted all the time, society would break down. I know this. I accept this.
The range of courses and cuisines on offer at the school is impressive, with baking, gourmet vegetarian, Vietnamese, a seafood masterclass and in Italian supper party all coming up just in the next month! As well as full cookery classes, Angela also gives tasters and demonstrations and runs a regular ‘Saturday Kitchen’ demonstration, where the ticket price of £10 includes entry into a raffle to win the food that’s been prepared! Course prices seem to range from £50 for a taster up to around the £150 mark for a full day’s course. I think the courses would make a lovely gift for aspiring or improving cooks, or for anyone with an interest in learning more about a particular type of cuisine or skill. Mr W was interested in the ‘Knife Skills Taster’ – should I be concerned?!
In keeping with the HHFKA, USDA will prioritize projects that serve schools and school districts with high free and reduced price meal enrollment. USDA also encourages eligible entities to submit “cluster” applications where, for example, one school district works together with several nearby school districts to benefit a greater geographic area.
Warren Penkala of the highly influential industry magazine Air Watch was skeptical of Hawai’i's long term chances for success with its new philosophy, though, noting that “the short term liquidation of capital resources looks good on paper, but projected over time it means that gains will become smaller and smaller.”

So, you might understand a pain to be a punishment from God. You might frame it as a healing, cleansing pain. You might be getting a tattoo done and be experiencing the stinging burn as exciting. In aerial I experience pain as potentially transformative - if I bear with it, I will be stronger.

In March 2012 high school students added their voice to the rising tide of protest from the education sector. It is not only students who have taken action. A series of protests and a strike by teachers resulted in the government deducting one month’s salary from all who took part. As the teacher’s union is legally registered, strikes are permissible, and the loss of pay has prompted protests and a call for further action.

While Natalie checks herself out in the mirror, Damon gets attacked from behind. The killer wraps a rope around Damon's throat. Natalie gets tired of waiting, so she steps out of the car, and comes face-to-hood with the killer. Screaming, Nat rushes back to the car, locks all of the doors, and watches the killer move around to the back of the vehicle, where he ties the other end of the rope he used on Damon.

He lead me forwards a few steps and then asked me to lie down on the ground. I obeyed with a mixture of concern and excitement about the amount of control I was allowing him to have over me. I was now lying on something warm and soft; in my mind I imagined it to be some kind of fur rug. I began to masturbate, expecting to feel the touch of his flesh against mine at any moment, but then he left me again. I was dimly aware of him moving about somewhere in the room, but I couldn’t work out exactly where he was or what he was doing.

I started having mean thoughts about Pinterest. I didn't understand why this website was so intent on making me feel like I suck.
Likewise, the evil person of kills or steals or plunders: There are true ‘evil’ people who do things to hurt others because they have a very sick mind, but there are those who are evil who do things only because they believe it is helping others — the problem being that their actions, unlike Ms. Mallick’s, happen to hurt the world as opposed to help it.
Of course, anybody who actually knows education, indeed, anybody who is simply intelligent, knows that intelligence does not come from rote repetition or parroting Power Point slides at the regimented direction of a room monitor, no matter how perky or well intended. It comes from an agonizingly complex, intricate, sustained set of challenges to the mind that are exquisitely choreographed over the better part of two decades, all intimately tailored to the specific needs of an individual, inquisitive, aspiring student.

I went back to my first love - sponging! Using Kim's idea of masking a portion of the card, I went to work and created my background. It really suited the new Hostess stamp set "Simply Soft", so I got a chance to ink it up! This was originally a line art stamp, but I decided to create the silhouette again, by colouring in the stamped images in the same marker - in this case, Chocolate Chip. Not a single embellishment in sight! Be sure to check out Kim's site, Joyful Creations with Kim, too. She does the most amasing CAS cards! Tell her I sent you, won't you?

I went to the key shop at the mall today to get some little spikes for my running shoes. The top picture is $45 worth of tiny metal screws. I would like to know what the markup on that is. Of course they did include the fancy little tool on the left for screwing them in with a power drill. Maybe the tool is worth $42 and the other $3 was for the screws. Add that to the $200 I paid for the shoes here in the first place and these are turning into one expensive pair of Mizuno's.
It would take too many days to tell you the full tale of the terrible journey Snow Woman had to make to reach the place above where Earth meets the sky, and of the despair she felt at her impossible task. How could she save her people from Friij? How would she find the way? But in the end Jack Frost found her trudging through the skies, lost, lonely and desperate, and he took pity on her. He brought her one of his winged reindeer, and he showed her the path to her journey's end. There he built her an icicle house, with some of his exquisite flower pictures on the windows to remind her of happier times.

-What do you like most about the curriculum? I really love that it gives me a framework for instruction that goes beyond the standard seasons/holidays. Before using ULS, I had no curriculum to follow (other than the AUEN, but that's merely skills and skill sets, and certainly drives IEP goals but not how to teach them or anything resembling themes or units). So, I followed the seasons and the holidays...and felt really stuck in a rut. Especially since I have my kids for several years at a time! I would stress myself out over finding fun and new activities for, say, winter...that my kids hadn't done the year before. So, I love the variety!

At Home in Mitford (and the whole series) by Jan Karon. I love the quirky and real characters in these books. They have all become like dear friends. It reminds me how to live as a person of faith in this world, and what life would be like if everyone thought of the good in others and the good that they could do for others. It also makes me chuckle, but I think I'm an easy laugh.

So where do you start? Start with the very basics--goals, motivation and conflict. Seems simple, right? And yet time after time I have seen writers have to rewrite entire chapters because they are wondering about. Their characters have no purpose-no goal in the scene. If they have a goal such as attending the school of their choice then you need to motivate the reason why. It needs to be a strong motivation to vigorously move the story forward and keep the reader from thinking your characters are too stupid to live. Once you have them with a goal-in each scene-and strongly motivated you need to build internal conflicts that drive them to change. Here's an example of an internal conflict: as a small child the protag watched her mother struggle raising babies. She internalized that babies are bad. Therefore she has made the internal decision to never have children. Now-she finds herself either a) pregnant or b) in love with a man who has or loves children or c) must rescue a baby and bring it on her journey. This means that the character has to change her fear or dislike of babies to move forward. GMC is the basic building blocks of creating a character-even an evil villain.

Or when Batman is being attacked by a rubber shark while on a rope ladder. Bats tries to punch the shark off of him, but all his blows do is sound like a guy hitting rubber. He calls up for Robin to get him the Shark repellant and, sure enough, we get a shot of four canisters, one of which is labeled “Shark Repellant.” (I wonder if Aquaman gets to borrow the Manta Ray Repellant.) Robin then walks the repellant down the ladder to hand it to Batman. While no one talks about how bad-ass Adam West’s Batman is, I would like you to remember that the next time you’re having an argument with your pals about which Batman is the baddest ass of them all that Adam West had a shark clamped down on his leg and he didn’t scream one bit.

I must have been looking at the restaurant menu before as really this is quite a limited menu for us. You’re faced with 2 mains, a salad or an omelette and whilst I like omelette’s i’m still trying to watch those carbs..had it not been a Saturday I would have gone for it. There are 3 sandwich options, egg mayo, cheese or a toasted open toasted sandwich with mushrooms. looking around at the other tables I could see the sandwiches and along with the 2 mains.. the prices were making me wince, were they really going to blag almost £4 off me for a side order of onion rings?
One thing our leftist friends never consider is how their desire to pick business winners (as evidenced by the Solyndra debacle in the US) effects the things they profess to care about so much. For example when a socialist government subsidies a Solar power company that is not able to compete with a Natural Gas power company it costs jobs and living standards in the country. How? As the article points out, the more productive company must then divert resources it would use expanding it’s business (a process that always begins with hiring additional staff) defending it’s business against the less able competitor that the market would otherwise have rendered obsolete (which is not to mention that these subsidies are funded through job killing taxes or interest rate rising debt). Less money and jobs in an economy will always harm the poorest citizens in a country disproportionally.

Before we go into the details of the subject let us first clarify what we mean by the terms “general” (aam) and “absolute” (mutlaq). When a verse is described as “general” it means that it covers everything related to the subject. “Absolute” means that the verse is not limited in a particular aspect of the subject in question. If a verse is general, another verse (or evidence from Sunnah) is required to make it specific (khass) otherwise it must remain as general. Similarly if the verse is absolute another evidence is required to “limit” (muqayad) it, otherwise it to remains absolute.

Tanstaafl, you say want a jew-free white nation. But this is precisely what Jews fear (and have always feared). No wonder no white movement, no matter how ostensibly philo-semitic (see American Renaissance), has ever gotten much help from them. Aside from this, Jews know they are guilty of covering up their involvement in Communism and their role in non-white immigration. They see little to gain in admitting to any of it. Auster knows this too. He knows Jews will never become pro-white en masse. His interest is Israel; hence his focus on Islam, hence his focus on “Western Civilization” rather than “race”. Nevertheless, he’s valuable. But he has no way of artificially containing people’s awakening except to play the antisemite card. About time a Jew became a useful idiot, I say.

I’m still feeling very mixed up and kind of uncomfortable. Uncomfortable in my own skin. I’m feeling better but worse, good but bad. I guess that I should see this as a positive thing, a step in the right direction. Surely it’s better to feel mixed up, than feel just bad? I wonder if these are the steps I need to go to in order to recover and get my life back. Before my hospitalization, a year ago, I wasn’t content with life, in fact I was going already for 8 months to a private psychologist twice a week and a private psychiatrist every couple of weeks too. Before those 8 months or so, I also wasn’t happy, but I’d do anything to be able to go back to how I was then. At least I was functioning on the outside world, going to work, going to the gym and able to go to stay at my sister’s on the weekend without having such anxiety overcome me.
Many on your world are more caught up in the physical aspects of these changes, and many are more caught up in the esoteric and spiritual aspects of these changes and while we recommend a blending of the mindsets that still separate physical and spiritual, we say that this perceived separation can be a good thing for you are all directing your individual and collective energies to each and every facet of these events, be them physical or spiritual.

Aired by CBS beginning in 1969, "J.T." starred a young Kevin Hooks as J.T Gamble, a Harlem boy who saves an alley cat and nurses it back to health during the Christmas season.

And there's a sad spot in it--which was pro forma kids films back then--but has a happy ending.

Lunch preparation as required (I'll probably have started before; my nieces and nephew all come with their own lunches, but sometimes things need to be reheated or cooked).

So I guess I’ll start with the House of Night Series. I started reading this series when my brother’s ex-girlfriend got for me as a gift for my birthday (maybe it was christmas, I don’t remember). After reading Hunted I thought that was the end to the series… apparently not. I learned that there was another one after Hunted but I just didn’t want to continue. The series was okay but I had my run with it…. I’m pretty sure anyways.
I want to offer the favor, by telling freshman the truth. Temple is a playground of opportunity where only the strong survive. Strong naming only a few.

As my friend showed a book closer to the original one states PERIODS not days showing once again translations can misinterpret something and then it can become law in many minds.

So, Thai speakers, please pardon the somewhat false inclusion of the Red Light cover. The image was just too astounding not to include here. I'm have every hope that one day we're able to hear The Law Of The Red Light LK 094, but in the meantime....Enjoy LK 154. 320 vinyl rip by yours truly.

Here’s an example for you when determining the location (the WHERE) of your meeting. Let’s say you’re holding a meeting where you will have a variety of participants from across the state. You may plan to designate a specific region WHERE you want to host your meeting. For those of us in Michigan, we often reference WHERE by using our own hand or the mitten (one of my favorite tools as a Michiganian)… We point to our hand and reference WHERE to many things… WHERE we grew up, WHERE we live, WHERE we went to school, etc. We can also say “we’re holding our meeting here…” Since the state of Michigan is so large, WHERE you hold your meeting could vary from a variety of destinations… the Upper Peninsula, Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western or Central/Mid Michigan. Many annual meetings may alternate locations throughout the state so that participants have an opportunity to travel and gain a variety of experiences.
Denver retired with honors and went on to work in private investigation. This is when Grace finally took control of her life and the lives of her children. She filed for divorce and a judge, who didn’t care for Denver, gave her an order of protection so that Denver would be forced to leave their home. Without the state police force to back him up, Denver didn’t fight the divorce, and he gave Grace the divorce she wanted and moved to Texas, where he still lives today. As the years passed, Denver never contacted his children, except to ask them for money. Both boys knew their father wasn’t a real father to them so Denver’s actions weren’t a surprise to the boys. They cut all ties with their father, and they clung to their mother.
Another thing that was tough, especially at the beginning, was when I was working at home, and I could hear Toby crying in the other room. The sound was heartbreaking to me, but I couldn’t go out to him because I was busy working or on a conference call—and plus I had to respect the sitter and trust her to take care of him. There's a certain stress of being on deadline, and a certain stress of hearing your baby cry, and I was getting both at once. (And when I heard him playing and laughing, I would want to go out to him, too!) I do crave some mental and physical distance from the baby while I'm working.
You’re so fine
I'd probably stop writing the blog if there weren't any feedback :) The idea was to connect with people, learn from them, and keep on track with the zero waste thing. It's not ROCKET SCIENCE, but it's not so easy sometimes - one needs to unlearn decades of BRAINWASHING/MARKETING sometimes, re-explore basic assumptions, one can get disheartened without positive encouragement, especially if there may be many obstacles or some negative feedback/experiences in RL...

This was what I wore the day after we went to WWRY. See my hacked up Queen shirt? :-D My hair was still pincurly (I'm curly right now actually!) so I wanted to take full advantage of it and take some pictures. They're more flat and messy than the day before but I still loved it. I also love the way the curls bring out my haircolors. The day before I took these pictures (the day we went to WWRY) the weather was absolutely lovely and almost warm. The day I took these pictures it was pretty cold. Also, the bottomlid of my left eye was a little swollen and red because I accidentally scratched myself in the eye :-(. Seriously, I'm the clumsiest person I know. Who the hell scratches themselves in the eye?! I AM ASHAMED. No not really, I laughed about it with my boyfriend afterwards but still, it hurt! I do stuff like this quite often. I once or even twice woke up with my nosepiercing missing because I accidentally pulled it out of my nose in my sleep. After it happened two times, I bought the piercings with the twisty end so I can't just pull it out. I used to bite my tongue and my lower lip a lot too but once I started eating more slowly I rarely do that anymore. I don't think I will ever wear stiletto's out of fear of breaking my foot or something because really, if anyone can, it's me.

I’m going to keep these tones in mind over the next few weeks and try to double my smooth breathing technique and monitor my blood pressure. And drink my tea every morning and make sure my pants are pulled up properly. All of these morning techniques should make for me having a calm and even temper and, of course, make sure that I KEEP MY TEMPER IN CHECK.

I have been in a blogging rut of sorts this past week. No oomph to post anything even though I have got a couple of recipes that I've tried later that I should blog about. The other reason is work I guess. I’ve been going home at about 10pm everyday, which means I’ve only got energy left to bathe and sleep when I get home. Even exercise plans have been put on hold because I can’t bring myself to wake up at 6am for my run. And plans to run near the office have not materialize because I much rather complete my work and get home than run and work later. Like today, I slept in late till 8am (because of my darn body clock) and finally am going out for lunch with the girls later. But after that, it's back to work - yes, even though it is Labour Day :/
Beginning his career as a DJ in Philadelphia, it wasn’t until Diplo decided to become a producer that his career took off. As a producer, Diplo collaborated with artists like Shakira, Kid Cudi, Bruno Mars, Snoop Dogg, Kanye West, and M.I.A. It was because of his work with M.I.A. on the Grammy nominated track “Paper Planes” that Diplo began to receive recognition.
It’s a funny thing though. Now that I have my title, I can envision the cover art really clearly. I just have to figure out how to create it…

I walked into the printing place, and the woman who helped me seemed to be about my age. I handed her my application, then she was like, “oh, you need to take a math test”. The look on her face and the tone of her voice, though, was more like a, *sigh* great, here’s another one.. Not very friendly at all. In fact, all of the workers there were not smiling. It kinda made me think twice about my decision.

Recently, I have just picked up a new craft, tatting. It is an art of creating lace with just a simple thread and a shuttle or needle. I must say this craft is intriguing and addictive. Last Saturday, members of this interest group (Shuttles & Needles) which I joined had a small gathering. I thought it would be great if I make a cake of the same theme. To be honest, I have no inkling of needle tatting. So if the loops I made for the needle is incorrect, I apologise.

I think the ultimate point of this post was to tell you I’m going out of town to a place where I won’t have internet access. Did you know there was such a place? My cabin is in northern Minnesota, and it’s a bit rustic. We have running water (not drinkable) and electricity, but no reliable cell service, no land line, and no internet. It’s a great place to go to unplug.
Christie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these have explored and offered accounts of Christie’s disappearance in 1926, including the 1979 film Agatha (with Vanessa Redgrave, where she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband) and the Doctor Who episode “The Unicorn and the Wasp” (with Fenella Woolgar, her disappearance being the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown due to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien as well as time travel in the TARDIS). Others, such as 1980 Hungarian film, Kojak Budapesten (not to be confused with the 1986 comedy by the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie’s criminal skill.[36] In the 1986 TV play, Murder by the Book, Christie herself (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft‘s 2008 visual novel Shikkoku no Sharnoth ~What a beautiful tomorrow~, Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a charcter in Gaylord Larsen’s Dorothy and Agatha and The London Blitz Murders’ by Max Allan Collins.[citation needed]

Me being naive and thinking it was a friend turn around and am ready to go shot for shot with a friend when I see dun dun dun Mr. Mustache. He bought my friends a couple more rounds and came over and talked to me. My friends (being the assholes that they are) left me to fend for myself. This guy thought he had a chance, I mean I am not outright mean and who knew if he would be back so I didn't want to burn bridges but he talked my ear off. I am not sure about what because I had probably drank a bottle of vodka and then some by this point but the girls were sitting at the bar and yelled my name. I turn and they snapped a picture of me and the guy that still haunts me to this day. I basically look like I am ready to kill them and he is cheesin it up for the camera.
“For me personally, it’s a great way to see how the city operates and the amount of things it provides. It’s a cradle to grave operation,” Steers said. “The fire department can deliver babies, the city does early childhood education and at the final step, when someone passes away, they can still come back to the city and can take care of everything.”
Equipped with the usual Noodler's qualities and characteristics of good flow, durability after exposure to water, no showthrough (on good paper) and average drying time, the allure of this ink really comes down to color, and it really is a rich, soothing purple. I don't have other purples to compare this ink to, but I can say for sure that it is my second favorite ink, following Noodler's Red-Black. Though not a drawback for me, this ink doesn't have much in terms of shading, writing a very consistently colored line, even with an italic nib. But the color is so fantastic despite this!

She was always very cautious when it came to guys. she wasn’t the type to start-up a conversation with people she didn’t know. “Let’s go, Marianna!” Isabel begged. “Don’t listen to your friend.” Roger said. “Let’s get to know each other and have some fun. The night is young. ” Marianna was thrilled at the thought of going out with someone who wasn’t from off the Creek. She had always been a glutton for attention. She spent her time with her head in the clouds daydreaming about Prince Charming and her knight in shinning armor. However, Roger’s idea of talking romantically to a woman was by saying, “Come on.

Best of all, last year when we went back, she asked her six-year-old brother to come along to see mommy’s school. The brother was excited. He, too, like his sister, was melting in the heat on our way. He walked along with us, playing with the toy soldier he had in his hand. Never paid any attention to anything I said, or any building I pointed out. He only looked up with interest at some boys playing soccer on a field and showed some enthusiasm when I pointed out where his grand father played cricket. I think he was trying to visualize his heavy-set grand father, as an athletic young man, playing a sport. The circle of life.

While specific details aren’t yet available regarding why the Washington archdiocese made the decision to impose the harsh penalty, a letter that is dated March 9 and that addresses the issue has been uncovered by the Washington Post. In it, Bishop Barry Knestout, the leader of Washington D.C. and Maryland area churches, told other local priests that the punishment came as a result of Guarnizo “engaging in intimidating behavior toward parish staff and others that is incompatible with proper priestly ministry.”
Here in north Idaho is prime hunting country.

That's when we discovered a hole in the chicken wire and two other chickens were loose. The first was caught quite quickly but the other ran into a group of trees and bushes.
Nip = to leave, to go out. Example: I will nip to the shop before I go home.
Besides the caribou, I saw two white foxes and one very dark red fox. The white foxes were too far away for pictures but I watched them through the binoculars as they went about their day hunting for lemming nests under the snow. As an adaption to winters in permafrost country, lemmings and voles make grass nests above ground during the winter months. This in turn provides a winter food source for the foxes by having the rodents where they can catch them more readily. Also, white foxes that are not attached to a den or raising pups, move around in the summer looking for abundant food sources like water fowl nesting colonies. When they find a area of abundant food, like waterfowl nests, they cache most of the eggs for later. Most of the time it isn’t the fox that made the cache that finds the food, as that fox could be hundreds of miles away by winter time. Over the millennium this has developed into a survival technique that helps the foxes make it through the lean winter and early spring months when food is hard to locate.
For example, lemons are very acidic, however the end products they produce after digestion and assimilation are very alkaline so, lemons are alkaline forming in the body. Meat leaves a very acidic residue in the body so, like nearly all animal products, meat is very acid forming.
When my mom and Dr J were here for our wedding, Dr J forgot some clothes in the guest room closet. My mom asked me to send them to her house. When she sent me money for my birthday a month later, she included $6.73 to cover the shipping for Dr J's stuff.
The other night I had a dream about a house. I was standing directly in front of the house looking at it. In my dream it was not the home I live in now, but a home I had just bought and I was really excited about it. I took a camera out of my pocket and took a picture of it and told myself in my dream that I wanted a picture of it so I wouldn't forget what it looked like. I snapped the pic and that was the end of the dream.

And for me, the memories of my youth really began in Hong Kong. That home that she remembers so clearly was never a fundamental part of my life. I never had a stable set of friends that I grew up with. I never had grandparents that I spent years with and could escape to. I never had aunts and uncles and cousins that were right on my doorstep. I never had a place that felt like that word “home,” a word that means so little to a TCK. I never had the life she had.
For the sentiment I used a piece of vellum and I stamped and embossed it in White.
I’m so grateful that she answered my e-mail message to her. She’s so nice, kind, approachable, easy-going, and pretty as well. When I finally saw her, standing in front of me, I can’t even talk properly for I was so nervous. Since I woke up this day, I can’t help thinking about the interview. I’ve been waiting for this day to come and now, we successfully met and talked to her personally. She shared some of her experiences in the life of a Candy Girl.
Robert Cox’s The Final Event provides major new insight into the timing and significance of the momentous events beginning now to unfold on planet earth at this most crucial period of human history. Based upon his own intuitive cognitions, the author ties together prophetic indicators derived from the Vedic, Egyptian, Christian, Greek, Judaic, and Mayan traditions to develop a predictive historical model, which spans the last 13,000 years and, for the first time, connects the Precession of the Equinoxes with the cyclic unfolding of the four Ages of Man.

When we arrived at the Pinnacles, there was an ampitheater which we went to look at...a guy in the group told me to go down the steps to look at it better. When I turned around the group started singing "Happy Birthday" to me. Sneaky Jesse, who told me he didn't say anything about my birthday! It was a nice surprise.

“So he says, ‘I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto my Father but by me,’ and I agree with that statement! Jesus Christ, peace be upon him (pbuh), was the way, the life, and the truth, no man came unto God Almighty but by Jesus (pbuh), during his time! Every messenger during his time was the way and the truth to Almighty God. At the time of Moses, Moses (pbuh) was the way, the truth and the life. No man came unto God Almighty but through Moses (pbuh). At the time of Jesus (pbuh), he was the way, the truth, and the life. At the time of prophet Muhammad (pbuh), he was the way, the truth, and the life. So every prophet at his time he was the way, the truth; and I agree with that statement! It meant that if you follow me you are following Almighty God. He was the way!”

We read a lot of scripture & talk up how Christmas is about the birth of Jesus, NOT about Santa & getting stuff. We tell the kids how we give each other gifts to honor Jesus birth & celebrate him. We teach the kids about the real St Nick & let them know that Santa is just a man dressed up in a costume like at haloween. But we also tell them to pretend along with the other kids to make sure we don't ruin the magic for anyone else :)I wish we could do Angel Tree &/or Christmas Child but our finances have not allowed for that for several years. I can't wait until next year when I can work & we might be able participate in these again - I have sorely missed it!

He came home early from work and just sat silently next to me while I tried to work. I just wanted to kick him. Leave me alone. The stress is killing me. Then he finally says “I’m so sorry for hurting you, I never meant to, and I guess its been going on a long time?” But I don’t think he believes it. I think he thinks I am going through some sort of phase and he just has to hold on and put up with it. But I don’t know what he thinks, because he has never ever told me.
We grew up. We moved away. She's a social worker in Madison, now, and I'm an office manager and church organist in Milwaukee. We run into one another once in awhile at funerals.
