I did find this pink applicator gel which i was going to sell in store but found the cost I paid for it to the cost I would need to sell a little blob at was just a total rip off.

By the end we were laughing. Because a cheerful heart is good medicine, and sometimes the best medicine for a complaining spirit is speaking thanks.
These are the only mechanisms Dawkins suggests for generating a World Ensemble of randomly ordered universes. Neither of them is even tenable, much less simple. Dawkins has therefore failed to turn back the objection that his postulation of a randomly ordered World Ensemble is an unparsimonious extravagance.
“Doomsday cults are money-making enterprises,” said David Silverman, of the American Atheists. ”I wonder what is going to happen on May 22 when people no longer have their possessions or their savings and we are all still here and they don’t have their rapture.”

I was taking down a fake ficus and replacing it with a living one.
For us though, the solution is not tying our daughter to our apron strings. It is teaching her to listen to her gut and giving her permission to take any course of action that makes her feel safe. She asked me once, what if an adult makes me feel uncomfortable and I kick them and run away but it wasn’t the right thing? I said, taking care of a problem like that is a mom job. You just do what you think is right at the time. Being confident and empowered is not a guarantee that she will be safe, but on some level you have to count on lightening not striking or you’d never leave your house.
My strength in running is that I can pace myself.
Visto che si tratta di un quaderno per gli appunti di viaggio di un maschietto ho scelto questo Edwin marinaio e l'ho colorato con i Copic. Le carte sono Maia Design e Magnolia.

I have other physical problems, that I have to deal with, so this treatment is doing a job on me. I had to stop taking the antibiotic, and now go back to see the doctor tomorrow afternoon. UGG!
This picture holds so much inspiration for me. I can just see myself and a dear friend sitting in a beautiful room catching up on our lives. To create my card I used the Papertrey Ink set "Simply Jane". I wanted to capture the design, and colors of the area rug, and I thought the Simply Jane frame would be perfect. I sponged the die cut frame with Latte pigment ink from A Muse Studio. Next I stamped the matching ornate frame image using Crumb Cake ink from Stampin Up. In the picture there are very light touches of pink, dark, and light, and I think I captured that in my floral bouquet with the matching stamped bow. I used two shades of pink from A Muse Studio, Bubblegum, and Shell. The delicate color shading was created using an eye shadow applicator. Love how that turned out! I used the PTI Linen/Canvas impression plate to add subtle texture to the back ground. I LOVE the way my card turned out, and I kinda hope you like it to. =0) Have a wonderful day!
I can’t say I have learned to be content regardless of circumstances. In fact, if things are not as I think they should be, I am seriously discontent, even irritable. But I wonder, If God is in control of everything and each circumstance is approved by Him, then regardless, He has allowed it, right? If God has approved it, then He has permitted it in for a reason. If He has a purpose for it then I’m supposed to be learning something. If I’m supposed to be learning something then God is not far away. Instead, He is close by working and waiting for me to accept and embrace each situation. I think this might be the secret to the life of contentment. Accepting and embracing the will of God knowing we are loved. He loves us enough to make us better, not leave us in our depraved state.
Of course, today the main focus on Holocaust denial is in the Middle East.

Most of us had decided to go over the back so I went that way after getting high enough, although I was on my own for the first bit as I had launched last. At Agassiz mountain the group had split up, but 3 of us chatted on the radio & decided to try & fly back to the launch (especially since all of our trucks were parked there at the bottom). It had clouded over some, so eventually the other pilots bailed and flew out to the alternate landing. That left me in charge of getting back to the truck and going to get everyone else! I was pretty low and turned to go land with the group a couple of times, but kept the faith & eventually skulked around the south knoll and had the landing in sight.
“Teacher, what means _____?” Are you asking for a synonym or a definition? The correct way to ask for the definition of a word is to say, “What does _____ mean?” Or “What’s the definition of _____?”
Hands down the number one topic in entertainment are the 2011 Video Music Awards. Not only did Gaga go Ga Ga playing her male alter ego Jo Calderone, Beyoncé officially announced her pregnancy with rap artist, and husband, Jay-Z’s child. That’s right! After a mind blowing performance of her new song Love on Top the celebrity unbuttoned her jacket and rubbed her growing belly as Jay-Z celebrated off stage with fellow artist Kanye West.

You'll remember in my review for The Yesterday Machine I wailed and gnashed my teeth about a plot that dared to "what if" the theory that Adolf Hitler could be brought forward in time to start a new Reich and instead fumbled with a story about baton twirlers and cackling, over-explicating mad doctors.

The Jeffrey Campbell Lita Boots are the most sought after shoes I have come across in a long time. I’m not one to be following shoe trends which is why I have to put it out there that I actually came across them through one of my ‘inspirations’. She happened to be wearing the ‘Spiked Lita’ in black (see below) in a news article I read. I thought to myself ‘I must get myself a pair of them’ which, my mum would not hesitate to add, is something I do about quite a lot of different fashion/beauty related products.
We want to immediately warn viewers some of the video you're about to see is graphic. A dog was eventually fished out of the lagoon behind me. It's believed she may have been in the 40 degree water at least an hour.
LED (Light-emitting-Diodes) is an energy saving lighting lamp designed to fit into roughly the same space as a CFL/incandescent lamp, but with the advantages of more energy efficient lighting lamp as compare with old lighting lamps. A LED lamp (also called LED bar or Illuminator) is a type of solid state lighting (SSL) that uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the source of light. They usually comprise clusters of LEDs in a suitable housing. LEDs by nature emit light in a very small focused wavelength range that is characteristic to the energy band gap of the semiconductor. In order to overcome this, two primary methods of creating white light from LEDs are being used, red-green-blue LEDs and phosphor converted LEDs.

Then I felt God speak to me: “If it’s your food and you run out, it’s your problem. But if it’s My food and you run out, it’s My problem. How do you want to live?”
I didn’t take this picture at night, but rather in bad lighting on a brown scarf. Yes, I know you’re all jealous of my photography skills. But fear not, I’m taking photography in the fall!
I'm fine really...coincidence had it that the very week you decided you wanted out, someone else walked into my life. So I have my distractions as I'm sure you have yours. I don't want any details... and I'll spare you mine.
He started off with some great advice, “never do a live Internet demonstration because it never works, never do a live audio because it never works, so I’m going to do both.” This followed with chuckles from everyone. Fortunately, both ended up working. He presented a multimedia package on the Savelkoul story with an audio, visual and written component and even a map detailing the chase. Brock Savelkoul, was a soldier who was medically discharged from the Army after serving three tours in Iraq. He had suffered a traumatic brain injury during an explosion there. Days after NPR had published an investigative story about his and four other soldiers brain injuries that were caused in that same explosion, Brock piled a load of guns and semi-automatics weapons into his pickup and ended up leading police on a chase across North Dakota.
The final meet-up, with all of us in our NINTH month of pregnancy. I decided there was no better to time to meet my message board friends in person. We decided on Mexican food (to induce labor!) I was the last to arrive (duh, I'm always late...) and when I walked in and sat down I remember someone saying, "do you need us to introduce ourselves?" I looked around and realized, no I don't! I knew who everyone was. I was among friends.

And then home in the cold full dark, the stars are bright some nights. I put on my wellies over my work tights and a big fuzzy jacket over my dress and me and the dog, we go out in the pitch dark to say hello to the Totoro tree. Hoo-ho. Hello tree. It's huge in the dark and seems to go up forever.
I trust that your comment was not intended to injure anyone and was only thoughtless. I have written thoughtless comments myself and understand the ease with which inappropriate things roll off the fingers onto the screen. I also trust that you are largely ignorant of this extremely serious problem that afflicts our youngsters or else you wouldn't have written what you did. I am not in the habit of calling out commenters... but this time I felt obligated to for the sake of all the beautiful kids out there who are left defenseless because of misguided adults; adults who are either ignorant of the power of evil against our kids, deluded into thinking that being "nice" to everyone is the cure, or who are spineless in the face of such worldly power that unscrupulous meanness yields.

Now while I am not a Christian something about this statement struck a chord within me – those who are influenced by Spirit (amended by me). You see I think real joy comes from allowing our spirits and the spirit of the Universe to move us. To me it means allowing ourselves to just be in the moment and open ourselves to the Universe, and all the wonder that is in it. Quite often it is a subtle moment, one that you might miss if you weren’t in the present moment. Also joy doesn’t have to be a fanfare of ecstatic feeling. Quite often for me it just brings a smile to my face and a warm, fuzzy feeling inside; a quiet moment, a private moment between myself and whatever is bringing me the joyful feeling.

Things change very quickly, though, when the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor. Everyone in town except Miss Anne and Sophie have been under the assumption that he is Chinese, but they know it likely won't be long before the growing anger toward the Japanese causes them to react anyway. He is already not the most well-liked individual, what with being colored in the pre-Civil Rights South, and Miss Anne fears for his safety. She makes a plan to hide him, and makes up a story that he's gone to Canada to be with his family. The lies weigh heavily on her, and Mr Oto wonders whether he will see Sophie again.
As far as the update goes I’m going to be taking a break from blogging for a bit. I haven’t been real consistent anyway so until January I’m putting it completely on the back burner. I’ll also be cleaning up the site some and getting better quality links up so you have access to better information. So until 2012, lift heavy, eat smart, sleep a little more, and enjoy the time you get to spend with your friends and family.
He quickly headed up the stairs, stepping over toys and more piles of clothes, looking for his wife. He was worried she might be ill, or that something serious had happened.
I'm continuing Anna's Cool Finds with its emphasis on describing the experience of dining at local restaurants in snapshot fashion. One of the things that excites me about "Bread and butter" is that I will have a great excuse to answer those questions that I have had in my mind as I have meandered through various local restaurants. I'll be finding out about the chefs making the food, and the people making the restaurants happen. And I will have my ear to the ground for events and other interesting food news in Marin. So the experience will broaden and deepen my relationship with all things food in Marin. I hope you will enjoy both of these expressions of my love of the food, land and people of Marin. And if you have any Marin food news tips, please let me know at AnnaHaight@gmail.com.

My goals for this week:
So, with the visual reminder of who all these cute kids are, in a nutshell here we are. We also lost our dear boxer, Bruno, and will have a memorial post to come. He was the best dog in the world and we are all sad to lose him, he wasn't even 7 yet! Not sure what is in store for our pet prospects, Luke is not very interested in a replacement yet. I am certain kids need a dog though, so maybe we will decide by the end of summer to get back into the swing of dog care. In the meantime, we can enjoy that we won't have to clean poop in the yard or off (Reany's) shoes.
He analyzed what went wrong. And the answer seemed obvious. They hadn’t taken enough precautions. Sure, Tori was on the Pill, but the real problem was him. He should have had a vasectomy. When Barbara had had a tubal ligation, he thought he was all done with birth control. He thought to himself: Tori is young; she may want children someday; she shouldn’t shoulder the burden by herself, especially since the consequences were more dramatic for him. If only he had had a vasectomy before starting this relationship, there would have been no problem. But, this is not an eventuality one foresees when one uses birth control. Preventing birth is its job, after all, and it’s expected to fulfill that role. But now he knew how imperfect it was. It was time to get a vasectomy, and he would never get another woman pregnant again.
Have a super, creative, fun day!
Lots of exciting outcomes. Marco Rubio is a new Senator and an impressive one. The execrable Alan Grayson is history. The Republican takeover of the House of Representatives is huge, a gain of 60 seats with 11 still to be decided, and a rebuke to Obama, Pelosi and Reid. Five more governors with 4 yet to be decided, and a stunning sweep of state legislatures.
Mr. Sapiens: Not often. Once in a while I guess. You know these are normally eaten by the well-to-do or by those whose have “fruitful” taste buds.
Yesterday while shopping in one of my favorite "boutiques" -- the pharmacy -- I saw an exciting (!) two-for-one sale on Caudalie shower gels. They are dee-vine. I have recently been diagnosed with ultra sensitive skin and these products are for sensitive and delicate skin promising to be "non-irritating and soap-free."

Bake the casserole or gratins about 5 minutes, or until the eggs are starting to look set but are still fairly wet looking. (Edit, this will take longer in a large casserole dish.) Remove dish(es) and change oven to broil (Be careful not to burn yourself!) Sprinkle cheese over the top and put dish(es) back in close to the broiler for 1-3 minutes, or until the cheese has melted. Be sure to remove while egg yolk is still soft. If you don’t like runny eggs, cook 2-3 minutes longer (it is still very good this way).
It’s only recently with the invention of the paparazzi, that we, the ordinary folk have seen what these icons really look like.

And once again it all boils down to emotions. Mainly one called regret. Next to unrequited love, the worst kind of emotion there is. Regret can seep into the very fibre of your being and poison you with its reedy little voice.
In the screenplay I had already hinted that the protagonist’s Olympic dreams might be the product of over-ambition so to have someone refer to him as Icarus was no accident of my subconscious mind, it was reaching in and plucking something out that I had forgotten about. Funny how knowledge works sometimes.
How about you? Have any of you been sucked into buying any of this “stuff”? And if you did, did it work, or is the product languishing on your bathroom shelf, or stuck forgotten in a closet?

That said, ASUS wants me to build a 50K budget PC that could be flagged as an all around performer. It needs to cater everything from watching HD movies, play some games at mild to high settings, and it must also be fast, responsive, and comfortable to use. They also added that the user doesn’t want to fiddle stuffs, so it must be low maintenance too. Here’s my answer to the challenge:
Let’s first notice that this verse does not say, “But you are worthless, messed up, sin-stained people. How in the world could Christ possibly love you? It’s unbelievable that you would even think you could do something significant for the glory of God.” Why would I say that? Because it seems as though God’s people have a case of stolen identity. So often, we come to God in our state of brokenness feeling pretty lousy about ourselves. Now inherently there is nothing wrong with that, for compared to Him we are kind of lousy by nature. But there’s this subtle trap of the enemy to keep us feeling lousy. So we live like unchosen, common, unholy, orphans. That’s not who we are.

We are in Week 1 which means, Entry and Living Area. I combined the two since often times they are combined in our homes.
I would like to thank BLESSMA for the help and support my family received when my wife’s mother died recently. Bill, Kath and her husband have been there for everyone. A few years ago when my Father-in-law died they were a great support and two weeks ago when my Mother-in-law passed the knowledge that they were there helped my wife and daughter cope.
I was lucky to meet Chris Brisley a fellow Strongman competitor, and I saw Alma at about 23.5 miles. But despite trying I failed to find Jo, Mel & Mel. I din’t see many runners I recognised other than the elites, but I tried my best to cheer a few who were struggling as people did for me last year.
In 2010, Farmers cost less than Travelers, so I switched, and had to get it done by September. In 2011, after a comparison, I decided to stay with Farmers, but it raised the rate 30 percent without notice. I was able, after many phone calls, to negotiate the rate down by $100, but Farmers submitted the bill directly to my lender and claimed the 30 percent raise was due to the replacement cost of my house going up that much.
Out in the bay we were on the look out for a variety of birds. Some appeared to me to be the average seagull, but we also saw white tailed eagles, a seal, and puffins! The puffins were the highlight and before we saw them we kept joking with Greta telling her she had better have not eaten them all.

To reenforce that walk means walk, and halt means halt, we did a few walk-halt-walk transitions, but he didn't want to listen to "halt", so I turned him toward the wall and figured that would stop him if he didn't want to listen (and we've used it before). Apparently Oliver's brain had excused itself because he literally walked into the wall (and yes, the entire time I was asking him to halt and every other day, he knows what it means).
First let me say that I am usually funnier than this but there are some things going on today that just aren't very funny. I mean they are funny but they aren't ha ha funny. You may or may not agree with my politics or dogma but I think we all agree that this country is broken and we need to do something different.
Flat shoes: A simple pair of flats or low-heeled boots makes any outfit look more demure; you might think that miniskirt is too sexy for work, but you'd be suprised how different it looks with a pair of flats. Conversely, you can pull off even a sexy pair of platforms if you've got the right pair of long, wide-legged dress pants to go with them.
This morning I particularly recalled a pleasant midday frequently reenacted, when Amy and I donned some favorite dresses from Gram's basement--mine was a pale yellow cotton sundress--and Trevor helped spread a large heirloom quilt outside on the front lawn in the shade of the mighty pine, tossing cones aside. Gram prepared a simple lunch--probably sandwiches and cookies and fruit and pretzels--for us to enjoy, picnic-style, in baskets or from platters or tied up tea towels. I had also selected a favorite red, hard-covered book off the shelves flanking the living room fireplace and taken the bound treasure outside alongside the simple spread of food. Being the eldest sibling and, at that time, the most proficient reader, I was consistently voted most qualified to read out loud from our favorite collection of stories of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (and other great tales).
In honor of Heather's accomplishment and our good fortune at being able to see inside her design procress, I'm hosting a giveaway of the ivory double dips featured on the cover of her book.
All I know is that God has been dogging me out about keeping my priorities in order. I hope that other Christians will understand that unless we put God first, those who don’t believe will have no need to put God anywhere in their priority list. We have been given a command to follow Jesus. To follow anyone, they must be put in front of us or we are not following at all.
On the flip side, if you suspect your child or student is acting like a bully, it is important to talk about the serious and lasting impact bullying can have on children and the potential consequences the child may face for being a bully. Equally important is talking to your child about changing his or her behavior.
Don't forget to wear green (or "gring" as he says) tomorrow for Jackson! It doesn't matter what you wear that's green...just say a prayer every time you lay eyes on the green item. Pray for an easy port access. Pray for no complications from anesthesia. Pray for calmness for Jackson. Pray for an anxiety-free day for Ryan and I. Pray for a cancer-free future for our baby.
“Certainly,” said the girl.
But scientists and environmentalists dispute the value of replenishment. For example, Beth Millemann, director of the Coastal Alliance, an environmental group, described beach replenishment as ”throwing dollar bills in the water.”
Management of the A&E department was poor, with problems including lack of leadership, poor environment and huge delays.
It was the youth vote who led the way – the 18 to 34 year-olds who voted for smaller parties, unfortunately, including the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (please read chilling New York Times article).
Well, I chose to ingore that second group of people. I'm a little stubborn, and I refused to believe that agents remember every single query they reject. I was positive that my letter and/or my opening had been the problem in the first go-round, and with my spit-polished versions, I could reclaim any chances they'd cost me.
Working with Chris Miller and Phil Lord was brilliant fun. Seeing two friends also be professional collaborators on this level of film-making was really inspiring. The comedy of this movie goes beyond slapstick humour. It’s truly intelligent hilarity. It’s a challenge to write and to communicate to your team behind the cameras as well as in front of them, and they did both with chillaxed ease. Seriously. These guys are awesome.
Apparently, Stephanie Nielson is very well-known; she has a blog, Nie Nie’s Dialogues, which garnered a pretty sizable following even before the life-altering event that is the subject of her memoir. She’s also been on Oprah and has appeared elsewhere to speak. How it is that I never heard of her until her book was released a couple weeks ago, I have no idea. Fortunately, her book was brought to my attention, though, and I’m so glad.
I can't figure out if it's best to just make them pick something early to give me the time to purchase/make whatever we need ... or to just let them keep randomly cycling through their preferences until the week before Halloween and then *shudder* fight the crowds to get what they want.
On Thursday, Sept. 29, police arrested Mr. Ferguson, an arrest they said came from a continuing investigation into recent burglaries in Wall. He was taken into custody following a motor vehicle stop in Jackson Township by Wall Detectives and Jackson Police.
Approximately 30% of Quebec university students are protesting the tuition increase. They argue that increasing tuition will decrease accessibility and in some cases, they are pushing for a fulfillment of the Quiet Revolution promise of a free university education. They claim that they are fighting for their lives.
So he put forth a new plan. He would bring the religious leaders of the Jews together and along with Paul have some sort of a trial. Our verse tells us that he commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear. The word “command” is used, indicating the severity of the occasion. They were ordered or incited. Failure to comply would amount to a sort of contempt of court.
so for 5 nights it totaled about $700, which we had over a year and a half to save for.
The first album was recorded in spring 1980 and during the recording they discovered that Cathrine also could play the piano, and had real talent for it, so soon after the release of the first album a synth was bought and Vacum had found its form. Most of the material was based on ideas of Cathrine that all the others contributed too. The first album opened a lot of doors and the band started touring a lot and the second album was recorded in MNWs studio in Vaxholm. They pride themselves of writing a lot of material which resulted in about 150 songs. The aim was to have a new song on each local gig which resulted in long long rehearsals and to top that a lot of gigs which started to wear the band down.
In the spirit of our New Year’s Resolution to eat a healthier vegetarian diet, we picked up a copy of Eating Well magazine. After looking at this recipe, and making a few modifications, we declared it a yummy weeknight success. And yes, it is another Brussels Sprouts recipe. I still regret the first thirty years of my life where I refused to eat them and taunted Fee about her love of them.

This mini serial also brought up something slightly unexpected; character development. Rory now seems much more at home as a companion than he did last series, and his stammering has almost disappeared. It's nice to see that Moffat treats even the seemingly unimportant episodes as a chance to flesh out his characters.
Our plan for the next day was: get a rental car, drive to my hometown (only an hour), my dress fitting & meet with the reception site to settle the bill. Which will be in tomorrows post! Do you think we stuck to the plan?

Actually now that I think about it, anything besides dorm style housing is a step up, so it’s not too hard to please me. But I am beyond thrilled with this apartment and can not wait to move it and decorate and make it my own!
If this project started in 2007, why did I only hear about it in January 2010? Why did no-one protest sooner?
Robert Dilenschneider, founder and principal of The Dilenschneider Group corporate consulting group, recently sent a report to his clients telling them that many of the protesters taking part in the Occupy movement are not a bunch of unemployed crazies and hippies.

X reiterated that he’d warned us that his teaching method was not Western, but then asked if it would be easier to write our final exam alone, as opposed to the groups again. I confessed that yes, that would be wonderful, and X agreed it was done. X then stressed I should go home for the rest of the day and practice self-care; I agreed to this. I told my group I was not working with them for the final and they, much to their credit, said they felt this unfair to me, and wondered why we, as a group, couldn’t be in a quiet room to do the next exam. We posed this to X; X later offered to let us write it alone after the rest of the groups finished. All was well – or so we thought.

There may well be, as this channel has experienced, a very deep sense of unknown sadness. And it is a sadness of what has occurred upon this planet, what has occurred in lifetime after lifetime with the devolution of the Plan. But that is all right, my beloved friends; let it go, because this will also be continued on by a sense of release. Many of you will want to rest, back to the time of being a child who needs a nap, or a child who needs a nap after they have had a good cry.

I was meeting my friends Neassa and Julie for what was meant to be a day out, but as I grappled with bad time management, slow traffic, and getting lost, I wondered what it was that had made me think that this was going to be fun? Was this not everything I hate, mass consumerism on an industrial level?

There are basically two ways to deal with a cleansing crisis: sharp, short pain, or dull, long pain. It does not matter which way you chose, the same amount of toxins need to be removed.

But it was all I had at the time (we didn’t have G4TV back then, something I realize exists now, but I hate the idea of matte-faced talking heads getting blankly jazzed about video games as much as I hate taking transit home from downtown Toronto during rush hour). It was all I had and it was always disappointing.

The success of the body, in fact its survival depends on its ability to receive information from the environment, interpret it accurately, and respond to it effectively. Unfortunately our neurobiology can work against us, for instance when we learn the “stress habit”– that is familiarize ourselves so much with the external cues of stress that we develop internal correlates that trigger the same kind of fear and anxiety as real life but now are due merely to imagination.

Then, under a darkening sky, along a narrow strip of grass between two stubbled fields – very uninspiring. It’s starting to feel quite chilly now and I’m glad to reach the shelter of a dense plantation of osier, some coppiced, some pollarded, presumably to grow withies for basket making, the traditional use for this plant. Beyond this, Down Wood which, like Kings Wood, contains substantial volumes of hazel and sweet chestnut coppice, but here it clearly hasn’t been cut for many years. Many of the stools are decaying and hung-up and fallen trees lie haphazardly across the path. It feels neglected, but in a benign way: the inaccessibility and lack of disturbance will make for good shelter for wildlife.

*The last two days this thought kept running through my head "All are safely gathered in.". I can't express enough how glad I was/am to have my family around me. Please say a prayer for our many many friends with deployed spouses. This is a very stressful time here and it's really sucky for them to be apart. Also, please pray for all the Japanese people who are missing or displaced. So sad.
I could just write each story line out fully, first one and then the other, and then weave them together, but the narrative doesn't work like that and each chapter comments in subtle ways on the previous chapter and there are foil characters in opposing story lines and things like that. You can't really write that unless you're writing from one end of the total narrative to the other. At least I can't.
January 1: A new year and a new beginning.
On Monday, after meeting with clients I spend sometime doing healthy shopping at Organics BMS. I bought prune and raisin for Nazhan and bought myself and hubby a vanilla Almond Agave Granola & organic Soya Miso. I like miso soup as it contain lots of protein and this time would like to try organic miso. My curious is the taste. huhuhu...havent try it yet. Owwhh...it remind me Cold Soba ingredients that I bought last time and havent cook it...Later I will share this Cold Soba Recipe.

Well, the first whirlwind week is out of the way. I managed to get everything done, except brewing beer, and get somewhat settled. I had my interview Thursday, which I feel went well. I hope to hear back soon on it, but I’m not waiting to take more action.
He tells me he will arrive by 9. At 10:30, when he hadn't, I was already getting flashbacks to the previous week and was calling him to tell him to forget it and lose my number. He didn't answer. Then called 15 minutes later to say he was nearby and would be there shortly. By 11:30, I was fuming and I was prepared to tell him as soon as he got to my door to go back to his car and go the fuck home. But when he called to say he was downstairs, it was obvious he had been dropped off. I totally could've still kicked him out, but I was drunk, high and horny. Fuck it, I said.
This would be legal and feasible, as the pushrods or torsion bar mounting could be fitted with a quick adjustment mechanism. Even within a sub 3 second pitstop, this could be completed accurately. But as the car will start the race with qualifying (low fuel) ride height settings, this could not be adjusted until the first pitstop, thus the opening stint would be compromised by the wring ride height. Of course the balance of the race could then follow the ride height with the decreasing fuel load, but adjusting at the second and subsequent stops.
Hmmm. Well, it's like this. One of the problems of blogging is that there's so much bloggingly good stuff out there, not here. I've been reading lots of it and even hiding inside some of it lately.

Peru Rail certainly takes pride in their company. They are the only rail company that will take you from Cusco to Aguas Calientes, but their monopoly on the market hasn't depleted their level of service. The entire experience with them was flawless. They have a great website that is easy to use and I was able to book our tickets from home before we left with no problems. The station was as clean as a train station can get and rather nice, the staff was helpful and friendly, and the train was on time.

The reality is that most of Aberdeen wants this road built. Imagine living in Stonehaven and working at the airport which is located at Dyce. Presently you have to drive through central Aberdeen to get there. With a bypass the journey time would be almost insignificant in comparison to how long it must take now. During the consultation phase there were numerous displays put on in Aberdeen and the surrounding communities that would be directly affected by the bypass to show them exactly what course the road would take and what affect it might have on the area. If there was as much objection as road sense claim there should have been, surely it would have emerged at these meetings?

It made me forget everything that I had been worrying about in my life and it was just so darn good.

I started this brief by first choosing the device that I wanted my contact lens to be based around. Since smart phones have become such a popular gadget, I decided this would be the best device to work with. I next had to come up with a way that the user could interact with the contact lens display, after writing down a few notes I decided the user would use their thought to navigate around the lenses interface. Using thought has a way of navigation is not new in the world of science which gives me a good amount of material to help me with my research. One post i found again on New Scientists shows how a game for the Ipad has been adapted to be controlled with thought using a headset (again click link to view the full post).

On the other end of the autism spectrum or continuum, children with Asperger’s Disorder generally have age-appropriate expressive and receptive language skills and average intelligence or above. They have difficulty using and understanding nonverbal behaviors, however, and their pragmatic language skills are typically impaired. As a result, social interactions are quite difficult. Children with Asperger’s Disorder typically have an overwhelming preoccupation with one or more topics (i.e., dinosaurs, skyscrapers, Egyptology, etc.) and are inflexibly bound by routine. They may have stereotyped mannerisms and/or a persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. This form of ASD also appears more frequently in males (DSM-IV-TR, 2000).
I'm pretty sure, though, that most of you will use other items. I hope that some of them are children's books that portray American Indians in tribally specific ways (naming a specific tribal nation, and, providing accurate information about that tribe). I can recommend some wonderful books. They may be in your school library, or the local public library.

The richest man on the ship, millionaire John Jacob Astor IV (founder of New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel) went to the same watery grave as the poorest peasant family who had hoped to start a new life in America. As women and children were being loaded onto the few lifeboats first, Astor had asked if he could accompany his 19-year-old new wife Madeleine because she was pregnant and would particularly need care, but he was denied. He was reported by survivors to have calmly stepped back, tossed his gloves to his wife in the boat, lit a cigarette, and watched as she disappeared into the night. Less than two hours later, he was dead. All his millions could not save him.

In its beginning stages, it will only be scheduled for Wednesday nights, But given the success that hard-working April has had with her Upstairs at Vitello’s jazz programs, it’s a fair expectation that she’ll do similarly well with her Federal programs. At least one hopes so.

Well I did it- I made a card! (For those of you who have not visited before- I have been intending to make one for the last 2 weeks but I have not been up to it following my operation.) I was on my own in the house on Friday- my mum-in-law has been coming up each day while my husband is at work and our son is at school. She has been helping around the house and making sure I don't overdo it! Because I was on my own our 9 month old pup had to be in his crate for most of the day because he is still too boisterous to be around me! His crate is in the dining room which is where I craft so it was the perfect chance to make a card and keep him company. I had to get my husband to get out the Big Shot before going to work because it is still too heavy for me to risk lifting down!

One of the very special and indeed unique aspects of Spearhead From Space is that due to technical strikes it was recorded entirely using film instead of the usual video tape. It's the only story to hold this accolade and it gives the whole thing a real boost.

Newspapers will always invent catchy headlines to sell their tales so perhaps, we can never fully avoid a trial by media.

If line personnel are the hands and feet of an airline, sales and marketing is the heart. It provides services from pricing, scheduling, customer service, catering, advertising, marketing and commercial and cargo sales. While every aspect is important, pricing and scheduling is what establishes differences between airline revenues. An airline could enjoy hefty benefits with a well managed pricing and scheduling system, it is accurate to say that these facts are what makes or breaks an airline.

The above photo was post-processed in LR only, reducing the highlights by almost -100 (this automatically did the recovery a la Lr3). Also I boosted the shadows by around 30. Added a graduated exposure filter for the sky, boosted the clarity and vibrance. This got me a slight HDR feel with high contrast and strong colours. Obviously the beautiful scenery of the New Swan Castle also helped.

Supporters claim that moderate drinkers would “hardly be affected”, but this could easily make a couple £300 a year worse off without even approaching the official “recommended” drinking levels. In fact, studies have shown that it would impose significant costs on less well-off households, while heavy drinkers would be likely to cut down in other areas to fund their alcohol intake. The claret and malt whisky swigging middle classes would, of course, be unaffected. A more broad-brush, ineffectual and poorly targeted way of addressing problem drinking is hard to imagine.

The choice of costumes were made by deciding which items would translate well in to rubber. Eg we weren’t able to choose some of our favourites like the ‘Little Rock’ dress from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes because one of the major design features of it is the red sparkly material. If this was made in latex it would just be a Vamp style dress, much like the ‘Yes, Mistress’ dress we already have. It would be very lovely but not unique enough to be in a Marilyn collection.

We started the evening with dinner at Au Pied de Cochon with Forest, Jeff and Tim (who's birthday it was also). It was very cold in Paris and we were planning on being outside at midnight so we made our dinner last probably longer than the restaurant would have liked. We then bundled up and headed out, bottles of champagne stuffed in our backpacks. Every bridge on the Seine was lit up with the new Euro symbol and the flags of each participating country were raised and waving. We made our way to Place de la Concorde where a huge crowd of people were gathered to watch the fireworks at midnight. Having drunk all of our champagne we bought beers from vendors with little tables set up for the occasion, toasted and kissed at midnight and then paraded down the Champs- Élysées with the rest of Paris.
Why does he give his time?
I travel a lot, I mean almost every week. Delta Airlines is my airline company of choice and while they have added tons of flights with inflight wifi (see GOGO), there are still tons of flights (primarily) the smaller ones that don’t. That’s where Pocket comes into play. I can quickly browse through my favorite Apps like; Flipboard, Zite, and Twitter and locate web articles that I would like to read later, or in my instance ‘offline’ when I don’t have web access readily available.
If one were to look at that photo of me with the goat, to follow the just edges of my clothing--the very points where they meet the sky--one might make a dot-to-dot picture that captures the general shape I fill. It is not a shape I recognize. It is not a shape I claim as my own, obviously.
How can his views be contained or should they be contained? The Norwegian response seems temperate. He was given the opportunity to read his statement. This was not filmed. So there will be no YouTube videos circulating ad infinitum showing us how he justifies the slaughter of 77 people. His statement was reported: we didn’t hear his voice utter his crackpot beliefs. The Norwegians seem to be doing the right thing. There has been an effort to balance his right to speak without giving him too much of a platform to promote his manifesto.

We accepted the situation as it was. We were going to get failures. To stop meant another weekend of work. We could kick off the installs and then just go back and run the sync when it finished. Toggling the system to run the sync was faster than interrogating each and every database. That was the answer. We didn’t like the situation and we couldn’t fix the application. However, we could overcome what was before us. So we started down that road. Then my manager got back on the phone. He indicated that because multiple sites were experiencing the same failure rate we were, they were thinking about doing a rollback. I explained the decision we had come to and asked that we continue forward and that our approach be sent out to everyone else. Realizing that he didn’t want to work another weekend, either, he did just that. The next day, when I was working on the Columbia upgrades, we simply did the install and ran the sync. Everything worked out fine.

A new line of beers will soon be made available over here, namely BrewDog beers. For those who dont know, a couple of 24 year old geeks in Scotland decided to open up a brewery back in 2007, to try to make bold beers with taste in a market dominated by poor lager beer. The persistence paid off and few years later they have expanded and have 7 beers in the UK. Not so shabby... and the beer is fantastic.

Carefully wrapped in a towel placed in her favorite bed, we returned home.

I ate at a roadside stall and asked the rajasthani owner for cheap hotels. I figured I should give these a look over once in case I needed to locate them later in the night. The first one I went to was 400 bucks for the room and hot water, the second one that I didn’t go to (because the reception was up a flight of steps in a crowded street and I didn’t want my cycle to disappear) I was told would be 200. Then I headed back to the beach which was still crowded at 8:30. I found a nice spot in the soft dry sand and lay down just above the waterline with my head-band beneath my head. I put the cycle right next to me and held onto the wheel with one hand as I dozed off.

The problem with the backpack hydration systems, I’ve discovered, is that you can’t tell how much you’ve drank till (a) it’s gone, or (b) you pull the water bladder out of your pack and look at it. You also can’t tell that your other water bladder was leaking till you (a) pull it out of the pack and see it’s half empty or (b) notice your sleeping bag is now holding the missing water. So there I was, alone in the desert, almost out of water. Still, it beats my old job.
On my cardio days I boogie in my living room to Wii games like Just Dance and shake my groove thing to exercise DVDs like Bollywood Booty. (No, seriously, I do.) When the weather is nicer, I'll add riding my bike and taking walks around the neighborhood. I'm even trying yoga (though yoga via DVD is hard to do, since you can't look at the screen and bend over at the same time).
That pisses me off. I don't remember whatever it was I must have been dreaming about, but at this point it's not like it matters. I don't ever wake up feeling rested anymore.

The raucous debates that are to be heard before and after the judgment and the echo-box streams that take their cue from them , have a few preditable characteristics. They seek to either protect God(s), or the constitution of the republic. The cynical use of the avatar of Lord Vishnu by the Hindutva brigade is matched well by “secular” brigades, whose parodying of the idea of locational divinity belies their ultimately belittling attitude towards the faith of small people – the unscientific, under-educated, in the penumbra of the Baconian world of the “seculars”.This utter disconnect is evident when Marxians of various hues bring in the “sociological” Ram to counter the “Ironman” Ram of the Hindutva Sangh Parivar. The charlatan usage of Ram’s powerful symbolism by the seculars who could care less of Ram’s divinity appears to the faithful like a village nautanki – a sordid one at that. The characters forgot change their dress and make up from the last scene but have only changed dialogues. Not many are impressed.

The Titanic sank in April 1912, exactly 100 years ago and the ghost of this ship has haunted many since. All of us girls had our hearts going on for Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in the epic movie and Belfast is where the ship was built and it’s here in the old docks that the new Museum resides and also where we will be staying, at the amazing Titanic apartment.

2. Gina Carano in “Haywire” – Many movie reviewers have been upset by the heavy beatdown Carano’s character takes in the new Soderbergh film, “Haywire”. When she first gets hit hard, it is a little jarring, but afterward (spoiler alert) she puts a bad hurting on Channing Tatum (he had it coming!) and it’s girl-power all the way! I was amazed at Carano’s physical skills during this film, reminding me of a much prettier, young Jackie Chan and like Lara Croft without the gadgets and fantasy. I would like to see more of this female spy character.
And so I stormed the gates of genre because I'd never really seen much of it through the bars.

Daisy recalled Lily softly for me. Lily was one of those people everyone wants to be around, she said, one of those people everyone wants as a friend, one of those people others find themselves honored to serve. Her native generosity came back to her many times over, and as she confronted the accelerated process of dying, was surrounded by people willing to help with the burdens. They were perhaps people whose grief took a practical turn, or who loved Lily differently. Daisy surely found her way to offer Lily every comfort, but there was also this: she was frozen in a grief so profound it may have taken even her by surprise. It was difficult, so unspeakably, terribly difficult to consider life without Lily. And yet Lily herself whispered, "You know this will be fast, don't you?, and you know I want it to be fast, yes?" Daisy could only nod and agree. And it went quickly, and one year ago, Lily was gone.

In the picture above, there's one unseemly corner of our yard, by a dog house which currently stands unused. I've been telling my husband we should get rid of this board and those rusty barrows, but quite unexpectedly, our chickens began to favor this spot above all others. Here they rest in the shade and take dust baths, which is great fun to watch.
Honestly I don't know what I hate more that, or people who constantly bitch about being pregnant. Seriously fuck you. I get it sucks to be pegnat sometimes, but if you're going to constantly bitch about it you don't deserve your fertility.
Where the ground is compacted (see left) I’ll first of all push a garden fork deep into the lawn in several places to let air get to the plants’ roots, then I’ll brush in some coarse sand mixed with soil to try to get a nice open soil structure. then it’s just a matter of cutting the grass as short as I can (to let light in to the seeds) scuffing up the surface with my rake, spreading the RTF grass seed, lightly covering it with soil and watering it…with a watering can. All being well, Mother Nature will do the rest.

Both Judah and Israel were prospering. There was lots of wealth and industry… the military powers were strong. There was a lot of eating and drinking and making merry. Corruption of justice was a common sin. Land seizure was an everyday crime. The rich became richer and the poor became poorer. The love of luxury was placed ahead of everything else. Religion had lost its vitality and power. Militarily, Israel was stronger than any of its neighbors. There was no other nation strong enough to bring it down… But Israel forgot about God. It was into this land that God sent Amos… It doesn’t matter how deep Israel’s darkness had become… God always has a human channel available to deliver a message. Prosperity was the big news in the business centers. Peace that came because of military strength brought merchants and trade. New markets opened up and trade expanded. People were prospering… False religions rose up to blot out the presence of God and His Word. The last thing they wanted to have on the scene was a prophet from Judah.

If I am honest the only reason I’ve noticed a change in my shape is because I have the same clothes and they fit differently. Otherwise I’d have probably not realised. Since having Jay and returning to the weight I was before I now have smaller boobs, my hips are larger and my middle is looser. However, my thighs and back are more solid and leaner and my hips now make an awesome clicking sound. So, it’s not bad; it’s just different (and apparently a change is as good as a rest).

As eggs are invariably stored in the fridge, you can bring them to room temperature by sitting them in a bowl of hot tap water for 10 minutes. Interestingly, our habit of refrigerating eggs is not necessarily good for them – they don’t like extremes of temperature (who does?) and prefer a cool environment to a cold one. The bottom of the fridge is the safest place or an unsunny countertop.

What unschoolers have captured is the beautiful realization that learning isn't separate from living. That in the process of living, learning happens. ALL*THE*TIME. When you're preparing for a birthday party, you're learning. When you're reading, watching tv, playing a video game you're learning. You're even learning as you rest or watch clouds drift by or sun yourself on the beach. It's impossible to not learn.

Think about this, too, when you’re watching JACKIE BROWN – it might very well go down as containing the last great movie performances from Grier, Forster, Keaton, Fonda, and even the once-great Robert DeNiro, who has spent most of his time since 1997 making either predictable crime movies or parodying himself in comedies.
Emanating from the fertile mind of writer-director Jim Makichuk, this Emmeritus Production, in association with CHCH-TV and Telefilm Canada, may look like just another in a long line of low budget thrillers about a bunch office drones struggling to stay alive in a multi-story building where an energy-starved computer wants to convert their body heat into power, but it's so much more than that. How much more, you ask? Even though I feel like I'm the only person living outside of Hungary who has seen this flick, I'm not sure if I'm qualified to answer such an awkwardly didactic question. I mean, I want to say that it's a cautionary tale about the dangers that could arise when a society becomes overly reliant on technology, but I don't really think a statement like that properly captures the unnerving disquietude that this film radiates on a semi-regular basis. What's a blithering idiot to do?

To finish the session I went for a wheat beer with a hoppy twist. Schneider Weisse TAP 5 was a cloudy beer with a nice, white and large head. There was some carbonation, and the aromas were very hoppy. I felt grapefruit and some banana. In the mouth this was a beer with an assertive fruit cocktail in the lead. Some bubble gum and sweetness danced along before a finish with a touch of sweet pear and a touch of hoppy bitterness. This was a very good beer, but I felt that a half litre bottle was too much. As a Weizendoppelbock with an alcohol content of 8.2%, this is a strong beer.

So last weekend I met my sister and niece at a Fall Festival the next town over. After about an hour or so of being her normal playful self, Paige had a meltdown. A major meltdown. A fall on the ground, kick her feet, scream and cry like I'm abusing her type of meltdown. My first reaction? Oh my gosh - what just happened? Did she get stung by a bee or something? And then I realized she was throwing a tantrum and so I had another thought - absolute mortification. As I struggled to strap a screaming, kicking toddler into her stroller, people turned and looked at me like I was the worst parent in the world. I'm sure they were thinking - "Wow. She really needs to control her child." or "She needs to discipline her child." And after I got Miss Paige strapped in her stroller, I gave a quick wave to my sister and made a beeline for the car. Before we even left the parking lot, Paige was asleep in her car seat. The tantrum was because she was tired - not because she is out of control or a bad kid or for lack of discipline on my part. It's because she is a child and acts childishly. She cries when she is upset or doesn't feel right. And I think that is ok. There's no amount of discipline in the world that can change that when she is just 20 months old.

China went through an enormous economic boom in the 1980s. The communists held on to political power, but allowed great economic freedom. It was now OK to get rich, and the head of the Communist Party (and thus the country) said so, repeatedly and in public. The military took advantage of this.

In writing often about New York Times coverage, most recently how the Time screwed up coverage of Bloomberg’s eviction of the Occupy Wall Street protesters from Zucotti Park, I have been making the point that you cannot cover the news selectively. Local coverage is related to national coverage. You cannot selectively cast a blind eye to the misconduct associated with Atlantic Yards as the New York City’s biggest boondoggle. If you try to elide the evils of Atlantic Yards in your pages it will leave holes in the paper-of-record stories about everything else. One of the really big stories about Occupy Wall Street (and even the Tea Party) is the rampant crony capitalism the nation is dealing with. If you are not reporting the real story of Atlantic Yards and the crucial involvement of mayor (who wants to be a national candidate and voice) you are not going to be first, foremost or reliable in reporting about key aspects of the national dialogue.

Gopal is a relatively poor fellow whose barely making ends meet. He’s no stranger to struggles in life whether it is tackling the entrance exams of IITs and NITs or finding his ambition in life. He feels that only money can get you happiness. Raghav on the other hand is ready to mount a revolution against everything corrupt and wrong happening in the society. He believes that someone has to stand up against the system. Aarti is a happy go lucky girl who every guy would dream of having as his soul mate.
But there are other ways to look at it. There is one interpretation in particular that I think has enough going for it to warrant a close look. Fellow Mansionologist Mike S. suggests that what we have here is an example of another well-known ghostly phenomenon: ghosts inhabiting a former building on the same site as the present one. What happens is that we see the place more and more from their point of view as the ride progresses, including its past history and even its past location.
Over the years the Mali program has often received Volunteers evacuated from other regional trouble spots such as the Central African Republic and Guinea. It has never before had to order its own staff to pack up and go. As long as the nearly 200 PCVs remained in Mali’s towns and villages, I could entertain the notion that things hadn’t gotten that bad.

There are all kinds of specific injuries and illnesses. Successfully Surviving a Brain Injury: A Family Guidebook ($17.95, www.braininjurySuccess.org, softcover) by Garry Prowe provides a wealth of information about brain injuries, noting that each is unique, from mild to severe, and each affects the entire family and requires their participation in the recovery. Brain injuries are far more common than most people know and the good news is that the brain has the capacity to repair itself in many cases. I would have to say that this book is excellent in every respect. It has just the right kind of information and encouragement that anyone, the patient and the caregiver, would want to know and need to know. Cancer is as scary as it comes, but many recover thanks to modern medicine. Joi L. Morris and Ora K. Gordon, M.D., have authored Positive Results: Making the Best Decisions When You’re at High Risk for Breast or Ovarian Cancer ($20.00, Prometheus Books, softcover). It is a singular, comprehensive source of information and advice to help women who are at high risk because of family history and their genetic profile. It is one part memoir and three parts “how to” manual, providing in a clear and steady manner the myths and realities of the disease. It lays out all the options in easy-to-follow compassionate language. This book will provide a lot of peace of mind for those vulnerable to this disease and the encouragement to know it can be overcome. We all know that germs can cause or aggravate illness. Joni James Aldrich writes of her husband’s struggle against cancer in Saving Gordon: Lifelines to W-I-N Against Cancer ($19.95, Cancer Lifeline Publications, softcover).The focus of the book is how to eliminate germs as a means to enhance treatment of a cancer patient. Since the patient cannot live in a bubble, there are many factors to keep in mind and they are spelled out in this book to include surroundings in public and at home, as well as in medical facilities. To maintain an environment that minimizes the potential hazard from germs requires a lot of effort and knowledge, and this book provides a lot of knowledge. Chasing Miracles: The Crowley Family Journal of Strength, Hope, and Joy ($22.95, Newmarket Press, softcover) as the name implies tells of the determination of John F. Crowley, the author, and his wife, to save the lives of their two youngest children, keep their family together, and their marriage strong when 15-month-old Megan and 4-mouth-old Patrick were diagnosed as having been born with a rare genetic disorder called Pompe disease. Their effort was ultimately successful, but the story of how they coped will prove inspirational to others experiencing a similar struggle. Crowley walked away from his corporate job to set up a biotech company to focus on finding a cure and today their children, despite their special needs, are now 13 and 11 years of age.

I am sometimes asked why so many of our Methodists have actively opposed Alabama’s controversial Immigration Law. Many of our leading educators, law enforcement personnel, and business persons have criticized Senator Beason’s law. From what I’ve seen, the motivation of many Christians in opposing the law arise from our own experience with Christ; we were aliens from the love of God, lost, then we were found.

November: Council of the Economic Advisers (CEA) Chairman Greg Mankiw explains that any “legislation to reform GSE regulation should empower the new regulator with sufficient strength and credibility to reduce systemic risk.” To reduce the potential for systemic instability, the regulator would have “broad authority to set both risk-based and minimum capital standards” and “receivership powers necessary to wind down the affairs of a troubled GSE.” (N.

I think my mom reads this. I am not certain. My goal is not to hurt her. My goal is to express my truth so that I can live. I know no other way. Ever since my memories of abuse surfaced, I have, in one way or another, been trying to get my family to pay attention to and acknowledge what has transpired in our family. On occasion, I thought my mother, sister and I could support each other in healing. I now know that I need to find support elsewhere, and continue on my journey to health. I have been through a lot and put myself through a lot along the way, and honestly, am grateful to be alive. I truly believe that every person’s birth is enough reason to live—if you were born, you matter. Therefore, I surmise, I matter. And I’m doing something about it—I’m writing.

The DEIS concludes that there would be no significant adverse impacts on either fire or police protection, though the document does not discuss—as several community organizations requested—the issue of terrorism.

Harry, who I have previously called Barry in this blog*, is in many ways like the singer I fictitiously named him after – Barry Manilow – both addictive and irritating in equal measure. He is freakishly intelligent, has a tan I could only dream of and gets a mohawk haircut to celebrate the beginning of every school holiday. He insists on calling his pets things like XO and Fuifui Moimoi, is famed for being magnetically drawn to improbably attractive women (thus, never me) and often displays the sage wisdom of a middle-aged man trapped in a child’s body/a hilariously unfortunate ability to repeat everything he hears (he once told a Liberal MP that John Howard was a dickhead).

Even bigger than the myth of public schools having some kind of corner on the ideal scope and sequence is the fallacy that the concept of "grade level" has any objective merit. In reality, "grade levels" only exist in institutional schooling because grouping children according to age is most convenient for the adults. But that doesn't mean it's best for kids. In fact, in regards to learning, the reality (which each of us knows in our gut if we're honest with ourselves) is that there is a vast range of readiness and ability among any given group of same-aged kids at any "grade level." Thus, you'll see kids in "4th grade" who can comprehend and enjoy books at a much higher reading level, and others who still struggle with phonics. And you'll notice a wide range in terms of those kids' abilities to understand whatever math is being taught in the "4th grade" classroom as well; in fact, some of the "high" readers might be the ones who struggle most with math! It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with any child; it just means that each is an individual whose abilities and needed pace of learning differ from that of other children and across the various academic areas of study.
The Aakash tablet has been one of Indian government’s most ambitious dreams, in recent times. The government’s objective to make quality education affordable to the masses caught the attention of the world. Yes, there have been several drawbacks, but, the larger picture still remains rather optimistic. Now, it is a wait, till the next month when the new tablet makes an appearance.
What is it that I can’t hear? What was it that I can’t see? Where is the familiar clink and smash of bottles as the street-cleaners do their rounds, emptying bins and washing away the detritus of another Friday night? Washing away the self-respect people left on the streets as they swayed and swooped and shouted and screamed and clawed and bit and fought and kissed and spilt gallons of fluid onto or into each other.
The Utenzi consists of four-line stanzas with eight syllables per line. The last syllable of each of the first three lines rhyme with each other while the last line has a separate rhyme. In subsequent verses the first three lines do not have to rhyme with the first stanza, just each other. The final line of each stanza maintains a consistent rhyme, tying the verses together.

(Or Science Fiction, if you prefer. When I was a teenager, Science Fiction fans were as curmudgeonly as jazz buffs and used to think the term 'Sci Fi' a terrible insult, but I've always rather liked it; it captures the slightly hand-made, fun aspect of the genre which is what I always liked best about it. )

The TSA then realized it had failed to screen the baby, and began searching for the family but were unable to find it. The TSA then notified the Port Authority police, though they stated that it was a low-risk situation. The police then shut down the terminal for 80 minutes, preventing flights from taking off and making passengers go through security clearance again.

As much as I can explain this to my husband, I don’t know that I’m getting through. Now I’ve done the next best thing: creating a list of questions that will help him and other office-bound parents gauge how (cough, cough) similar their days are to ours.

How about making this a genuinely personal journey of discovery? The John Safran/Lawrence Leung pseudo-documentary has been done to death but what if this show followed Zwar as he tried to dispel some mysteries he had about the other sex. His narration in this series is irritating because there is no point to it. The title cards tell us everything we need to know – now, if he was actually trying to find some real answers to some real questions and not just ‘do you like it when guys approach you?’ nonsense then maybe there’d be an interesting show here. Zwar’s a married man (we know because his wife is one of the women he interviews) so it’s not like he’s struggling to hook up with women, so who is he gathering this information for? Agony Aunts/Uncles has no point but maybe if the show was more personal it might.

I can understand why the loopy Left has gotten their panties in a twist over Arizona’s incredibly insane attempt to actually enforce the lawful immigration statutes of the land.

The irony! Since the late 1990s a number of academics, consultants, professional associations and think tanks have been making the case for the introduction of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) into the UK. This is a model based on debt-creation whereby a political entity – such as a local government – establishes a project area, sometimes on its own, sometimes through consultation with business, community and neighbourhood groups. The property taxes (business rates in the UK) in the project area are then frozen. The local government then borrows money against the project ‘uplift’ or ‘increment’, on the basis that if they spend the borrowed money on clean up, infrastructure, and other upfront activities then developers will come in and, well, develop! The belief is that this will lead to an increase in property values (business rates in the UK) and this ‘increment’ will go to the political entity to pay off the debt and to reinvest in the project area. After a period of time – normally around twenty five years – the debt will have been paid off, the project area gets dissolved and the property tax returns to going to the normal taxing authorities.

Phillippa runs away from home when she realises she can't marry her intended. She ends up at Pomeroy Castle after hearing the baby prince is ill and she thinks she can help. After actually helping with the baby she becomes part of the staff even though they know she is a lady. She starts to get close to Jonas and slowly falls for him but he is determined not to encourage her feelings as he believes he is not worthy of a lady because he is just a servant. But he can't ignore his own feelings for long and when Phillippa is determined to have him he can't resist her.

So, for the rest of the night I went around pulling on my shirt to straighten out the wrinkles while also trying to keep my arms at my side to hide my growing sweat-marks (which were simultaneously growing larger due to the stress and the lack of ventilation because I was refusing to move my arms). Some time around, oh 5 minutes into the night, I decided that this particular misfit is SO out of the running… and unfortunately, so is the EXACT same shirt that I bought in gray… Note to self: “Test drive clothing before you buy one in every shade!”
When Jake broke his hold on the crib rail his look softened. He reached up and stroked the peach fuzz on my cheek, with a feather light touch. As he ran his finger tips along the side of my face he whispered, “I miss you!” Before the second stroke his chin quivered as if holding back tears and with the second stroke he repeated, “I MISS you!” As if passed over by the hand of a mime the look on his face disappeared and my son, having returned, lay down happily in the crib for his nap.

Parissi re-formed the band with new musicians. The new lineup consisted of Bryan Bassett (guitar/vocals) and Ronald Beitle (drums/percussion/vocals), both from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Allen Wentz (bass guitar/synthesizer/vocals), who hailed from Detroit, Michigan. As the hard rockin' quartet began to perform non-stop and build a huge, devoted following in the Pittsburgh area, they were repeatedly asked by listeners to play more dance music. Disco was beginning its rule on the radio and the dance floor. At the 2001 Club in Pittsburgh, a table full of black fans kept coming to the stage and teasing: "Are you white boys gonna play some funky music?" One night during a break between sets, drummer Ron Beitle, in a group meeting in the dressing room, uttered the magic phrase that eventually was to be heard around the world: "Play That Funky Music, White Boy". On the way back to the stage to play the next set, Rob Parissi was immediately inspired to write the song that will live on forever, on a drink order pad with a pen borrowed from the bartender. The song took a total of 5 minutes to write. When the band went into the studio to record the song, studio engineer Ken Hamann was blown away by the potential hit and brought the band to the attention of Sweet City Records, which then immediately signed the group. Parissi had intended to record the song as the B-side to a cover version of the Commodores' "I Feel Sanctified", but the label suggested recording it as an A-side. Epic Records then picked it up for major world-wide distribution. During the recording of the first album, Mark Avsec was hired as a session keyboardist on two of the album's tracks, "Nowhere To Run" and "The Lady Wants Your Money", and was asked to join the band after the album was released and the group was about to embark on its first tour.

Three: She doesn't believe the Niqab, the full face covering (in case you still don't know what that is) is not of Islam and that she wore it for many years but eventually found it a barrier to communication. She calls on other women to do without it because she wants them to participate in public life without any barriers. Women should not be speaking from behind any walls, she says. Khalid's response to that is to blur the heck out of her. Clearly, the salafi version of women's choice is that a Muslim woman is allowed to say her opinion of the Niqab only if she agrees with it wholeheartedly and recommends it to all Muslim women.
For just as, while the whole body is quickened and illumined by man, supposing one said it were absurd that man’s power should also be in the toe, he would be thought foolish; because, while granting that he pervades and works in the whole, he demurs to his being in the part also; thus he who grants and believes that the Word of God is in the whole Universe, and that the whole is illumined and moved by Him, should not think it absurd that a single human body also should receive movement and light from Him. 2. But if it is because the human race is a thing created and has been made out of nothing, that they regard that manifestation of the Saviour in man, which we speak of, as not seemly, it is high time for them to eject Him from creation also; for it too has been brought into existence by the Word out of nothing. 3. But if, even though creation be a thing made, it is not absurd that the Word should be in it, then neither is it absurd that He should be in man. For whatever idea they form of the whole, they must necessarily apply the like idea to the part. For man also, as I said before, is a part of the whole. 4. Thus it is not at all unseemly that the Word should be in man, while all things are deriving from Him their light and movement and light, as also their authors him we live and move and have our being.” 5. So, then, what is there to scoff at in what we say, if the Word has used that, wherein He is, as an instrument to manifest Himself? For were He not in it, neither could He have used it; but if we have previously allowed that He is in the whole and in its parts, what is there incredible in His manifesting Himself in that wherein He is? 6. For by His own power He is united wholly with each and all, and orders all things without stint, so that no one could have called it out of place for Him to speak, and make known Himself and His Father, by means of sun, if He so willed, or moon, or heaven, or earth, or waters, or fire; inasmuch as He holds in one all things at once, and is in fact not only in all but also in the part in question, and there invisibly manifests Himself. In like manner it cannot be absurd if, ordering as He does the whole, and giving life to all things, and having willed to make Himself known through men, He has used as His instrument a human body to manifest the truth and knowledge of the Father. For humanity, too, is an actual part of the whole. 7. And as Mind, pervading man all through, is interpreted by a part of the body, I mean the tongue, without any one saying, I suppose, that the essence of the mind is on that account lowered, so if the Word, pervading all things, has used a human instrument, this cannot appear unseemly. For, as I have said previously, if it be unseemly to have used a body as an instrument, it is unseemly also for Him

If I were making a list for women, I would emphasize different things more centered around the specific roles that men play in the marriage – asking for his resume, work history, savings, investments, past relationships with women, parenting ability, self-defense ability, mentoring ability, and especially on moral issues and Christian truth claims.The most important thing that a woman needs is love, and the man should be ready to speak about love at length, and explain how he is going to provide her with love during the courtship and during the marriage. Women need to know that they are significant and desired by the man.

There I was, browsing through Christian films (I do that every now and again). I found one gem, "Countdown to Armageddon", which was made in 1996. It's another one of those, "the world is more evil now than ever" productions. I was having a good old chuckle their take on the world as it was in 1996. They came out with things like Jamie Bulger's killing is a sign that the end is nigh. Then the topic of the Antichrist raised its horny head. The laughing stopped and I thought "holy shit", to myself. They had described the Antichrist just as you'd describe Barack Obama!

A centipede that lived 45 million years ago exhibits perfect characteristics that are indistinguishable from those of modern-day specimens. If living specimens provide no evidence that evolution ever happened, if no evidence of any intermediate form has ever been unearthed, this shows that the fossil record refutes the theory of evolution. As in all other branches of science, the theory of evolution has been completely discredited by the fossil record as revealed by paleontology. Many evolutionists admit the truth of this, as does Stephen Jay Gould:

First off, Raku has the only authentic Yakitori grill in San Luis Obispo County. It is a long narrow grill sitting over a shallow hot box filled as needed with a special blackened oak imported from Japan. Raku’s Master, Tony, has installed some serious ventilation over the glass-enclased open end of the sushi bar, but he’s left it open so there’s still plenty to see. The hot coals being constantly moved around to maximize even heat. Smoke billowing or merely dancing over the skewers depending on what’s being cooked.

And he’s a terrific person with a smile that lights up the room. Say hi, and you’ll see what I mean.
One knows that it is not so easy to travel to Bhutan. The entry into the country is controlled by the royal family and strict rules for travelers apply. So here I am sitting in India, talking to a wonderful woman who I just met named Maggie. She is talking about being tired and leaving for a trip next week. Innocently I asked: Where are you going? Bhutan, she says. Little did I know that she is the Bhutan expert and the main traveling teacher from our Buddhist sangha for the subject Bhutan. She knows the country inside out and all the stories around it. This year she is telling me is special because the group was only going to be 12 when usually close to 60. And then she said: Do you want to go? I only hesitated for a second due to cost considerations, but all of me was screaming YEEEES. I circled the meditation hall three times and slipped a note under her door: Please take me with you to Bhutan!!! Thanks to my sister helping me out with the money transfer I am now all set to go. I am really going! I still can't believe it. I hope I am making myself clear how unbelievable this is for me to get a last minute opportunity like this. It does not happen like this or it does. And surely higher powers are at play here. We are leaving for Nepal on Saturday and then with a small plane along the Himalayas and on with jeeps into Bhutan for a 10 day trip. I can't say how wonderful it feels to be free to be able to accept an offer like this, or any offer in that matter. I feel the freedom to take chances and follow my heart like never before. I am still planing to make it down to Kerala in the second part of my trip, but who knows what else is coming my way until then.....

Dracula gets back into his old routine by chowing down on the daughter of one of the local yokels. However, the villagers feel the need to nip this latest outbreak of vampirism in the bud and set off for Castle Dracula, flammable objects in hand. The village innkeeper (Hammer stalwart Michael Ripper, getting unusually good material) boldly launches the assault on the Count’s stronghold by walking up to the front door and ringing the bell. Luckily the villagers’ cause is helped by the fact that manning the entrance is Dracula’s dogsbody Klove (Patrick Troughton, in a wig and makeup that makes him look rather like Liam Gallagher’s granddad), who is an idiot. Klove obligingly lets them in and they proceed to set fire to a few bits of the castle, but don’t actually bother looking that hard for Dracula himself. (The damage to the matte painting of the castle seems to be much more severe than to the actual set.) Feeling the job has been done, the villagers toddle off home, only to discover that all their womenfolk have been killed by rubber bats on strings, despite taking refuge in the church. Blimey.

Yeast breads can be time consuming and a bit intimidating, but not necessarily difficult. I would recommend working with a well written recipe a couple of times to get the hang of it. Some people like to work breads totally by hand and some like to utilize their trusty stand mixer. I do a combination. I mix it and start the kneading process in a stand mixer and finish it by hand. This works for well for me and I can clean a little while the kneading process gets started.
What got me started was reading this book by Gore Vidal- Kalki. Funny thing is, I remember around 15 years ago my mother telling me the story of the book. I was around eight at the time, but it still fascinated me and I always wanted to read it.. except I couldn’t find it anywhere. Then the other day after a visit to the bookstore where NOTHING appealed to me enough for me to buy it, I perused my mothers bookshelf. We have completely conflicting tastes in literature so I walked out without picking anything up. But a few hours later she came and gave me Kalki. I haven’t finished reading it yet, but halfway through the book I realized THIS WAS THAT BOOK! Its not as science fiction as I imagined.. completely and totally gripping- and exactly the kind of book I like.. the one that puts me on the side of the really evil and twisted protagonist and completely understanding why he does what he does.

He also becomes, nonetheless, an accomplice of the American OSS (precursor to the CIA). Campbell passes secret spy reports through his well-timed coughs and throat clears like “ahem,” while on-air.

The posters demanded unconditional release of seven Maoist operatives — Kobad Ghandy, Vijay, Vikram, Madanlal, Mahesh, Bhanu and Anjela. Calling them “revolutionaries”, the posters also called for a bandh in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa on March 23, indicating that they were pasted on the two buses more than a month ago.

This interview was given on January 31st before anyone knew who Nadya was or how she was financing her fertility treatments and children. This woman had no reason to lie and it’s clearly not something she would forget or misunderstand. Still there is no way of knowing. It also raises the question of whether Nadya really did just want “one more”.

In so many ways, Mitt Romney reminds me of Ronald Reagan. Reagan had lost his first bid to win the Republican nomination to Gerald Ford. He ran again and won. Romney has some of the same character traits that Reagan had and Romney has visibly improved his communications skills, delivering some excellent speeches.

In the 40s, Harry Harlow and a couple of other researchers gave some rhesus monkeys some mechanical puzzles to play with. Their intent was to give the monkeys time to get acquainted/comfortable with the puzzles before they began testing their ability to learn to work the puzzles. They thought that without basic-needs motivation (food, water, sex) or extrinsic motivation (punishment or rewards), the monkeys wouldn't learn. What happened instead was that the monkeys learned to work the puzzles just fine, thank you very much. Just because it was fun to work the puzzles. Just because they were curious.
My daughter was given a American Doll when she was very young and I have to admit they are some of the pretties dolls I've seen. People go all crazy about them, and you can buy whole wardrobes and accessories. I don't get that to be honest, but hey whatever.

Meanwhile, in New York City a new gang has risen up and is causing an upheaval in the criminal underworld; the Foot Clan is lead by a person known only as The Shredder. Four strange creatures, well-trained in the martial art known as ninjitsu by their sensei, are opposing this gang at every opportunity while striving to maintain a veil of secrecy around their identities.

Please note three things. First, there may be some additional charges in there that I've missed: the PLCB's site does not make it easy to get a total breakdown of charges. If I get better data, I'll add it. Second, this is what's called a "regressive tax." As a flat percentage, it hits poorer people harder by taking a proportionally larger part of their income. (Thanks to Grey Lodge Pub owner Mike Scotese for pointing that out.)
My pick is “Prometheus”. I understand the buzz is very high. And the first trailers looked intriguing. Also, there’s some cool rumors floating out there like this one about what Ridley Scott could be setting up. But, as I said before, when’s the last time Scott’s made a great film? “Robin Hood” sure wasn’t it. Neither was “Kingdom of Heaven”. I’d argue you have to go back to “Gladiator” for Scott’s last great film. The latest footage for “Prometheus” for me, makes it look way too like just another “Alien” film. And, frankly, that’s not enough. “Alien” is still a classic. But the times have changed. If all he can pull out of his bag of tricks is a storyline of humans discovering a foreign place only to be attacked by foreign creatures (in this case aliens) then…well… the movie sort sounds…slightly more intriguing then say “Battleship”. At least with “Battleship” I’ll get to see a lot of dumb action. An intriguing science fiction film only works if the filmmaker can do something new or something so great like “2001: A Space Odyssey”. This just has stinker written all over it to me.

Opening with strummed guitar and Jonathan Richman punk rock nephew croon about not wanting to go outside because it's too cold and there's no sunlight-"In The Wintertime" then kicks into Swell Mapsian DIY downstroke chug. A twinkly toy piano adds accents that resemble how the snow sparkles at dawn after a super frigid evening. Sure, that always looks pretty but anyone who deals with it knows that doesn't necessarily mean the blanket of white stuff covering the ground is all soft and fluffy. It could also mean it's hard and crusty and has left patches of those son of bitches all over the streets known as black ice.

I’ve seen all this before in Japan where demographics screwed over Ge-X and they’re in a right mess over there.

Staff meat is the really ropy old meat, which is sold to the middle classes who don't choose to feed their staff the same as they eat. We give a food allowance so our staff can choose what they buy themselves. But intentionally buying for others worse than you'd buy for yourselves. Well that, to my mind, - and to that of my Ethiopian friend - is dire.
So last April I changed my name at the courthouse. But I didn't want to change my name on my driver's license, only to have to pay again to renew it this year. So "officially" it is still my maiden name. For the last year or so I have been getting whined at by the bank, because my ID says one name, while my checks I get say another. They should be pretty happy next week.

Today we took the boys to the Flint Institute of Art. They have a small Picasso exhibit and a 3D exhibit I wanted to see what they had. I also wanted to the boys to see some art. I'm hoping they will develop a love for art. But this post is only partly about my sons and art. It's mostly about taking photos in the museum. You see, the FIA asks visitors to sign a release saying we won't post pictures on websites or use them for other, well, uses. I didn't want to discuss the fine print of what might be acceptable or not for this blog, so I was a bit gun-shy with the camera. I did get this nifty sticker so I wouldn't be arrested or something if I did take pictures.
"We call this the Hazleton INTEGRATION Program," Maddon says. "Integration. Not immigration." The H.I.P. people intend to build a community center for all the kids in the community to play in together. They intend to have various projects that will help bring everyone together -- such as the showing of "It's A Wonderful Life" in the community theater with Spanish subtitles, like they did last week. They hope to have frank and open discussions -- team meetings, if you will -- to air grievances and find common ground.
7. Tony Lucca (Team Adam) – “Baby One More Time” Hey! Speaking of the Mickey Mouse Club, Adam and Tony take the audience to Metatown on this Britney cover. It had kind of a bluesy feel, almost like if it were covered by Tracy Chapman or the Black Crowes. Tony performed rather well here. He had some good wailing that was on-key and tonally appropriate. He also dialed things back for the verses and amped things up on the build to the chorus, which is evidence of great control. In my opinion, the is the best performance Tony has given since the audition.

I like people and want people to like me. So to tell them that their conduct is dishonest or immoral isn’t easy for me. On several occasions, men have told me how they got out of a speeding ticket by making up a touching story, or how they got even with some rascal in a shady business deal. I’ve responded by asking, “That was clever, but was it honest?”

We jumped our car and drove it less than a mile when it died again. Oh, totally awesome, so it's not the battery which would have been a nice, easy fix. OF FUCKING COURSE. We charged it again, just long enough to get it to a ghetto gas station, so we could leave it there and come back for it the next day. Then we headed home, and my poor dad had to go to work all day after waking up before the crack of dawn to save us. Have I mentioned my dad is amazing?

What's worse is that a park-and-ride can induce more driving, because it can make a car-oriented suburban life affordable and convenient for people who work downtown but wouldn't pay to drive all the way downtown, either in pure dollar terms or in convenience cost.

I told you how Chloe was in the hospital for a week, then the next week after we prepped to get our home of 7 years on the market to sale. It wasn't the best week because my kids were on spring break, so it was a little stressful but somehow I pulled it off. Then the following week after that we jetted off to the Virgin Islands for a little family time. It was a last minute trip and we had a wonderful time but my Lucas was sick the entire trip so it put a slight dent in the vacation. Right when we got home my hubby and I have been non-stop house hunting but not in Connecticut. We are relocating to Atlanta, Georgia!
I felt like having Salmon Patties for lunch today, but didn’t feel like eating anything heavy. My quest for healthy eating is a continual one. I have to admit, it’s not as easy to keep up with as I thought. That’s mainly because sometimes I find myself busy and away from home all day. The easiest thing to do is pick up something while I’m out. I don’t beat myself up for it, but I would like to be more consistent. And, since I had planned on going to the gym after eating lunch, I knew I had to have a light meal.

Okay, so what does this all mean? For starters we have to be careful in the number of choices we offer consumers.

If you purchase a fish whole, you can also save money than if you just bought fillets. But, you really only gain savings if you know how to properly cut and slice up a whole fish. That does take some skill but you can find some good books to help you in that regard, or try taking a cooking class on fish preparation. If you are clueless, then buying a whole fish won't end up being less expensive. You will also need to use all of the whole fish, from head to bones, to extend the value of the fish. Take the time to learn these skills and your seafood will be much cheaper.

Similarly, Iran, and probably Syria, are reported to have backed Hamas with similar supplies of arms if not finance.

I submit that, for the most part, we can all agree that Sagan’s many contributions to science advocacy were varied and effective. Among many other accomplishments, he was a long-time advisor to NASA, wrote many popular books and the novel Contact, co-authored many scientific papers, and perhaps most notably, co-authored and narrated the science program Cosmos. I am primarily using the widespread admiration of Sagan’s work as a bit of common ground between Gnus and accommodationists. But I want to avoid recruiting Carl Sagan the man as a Gnu for two reasons: 1) sadly, he’s not around to represent his own views; 2) his arguments and methods now have a life of their own and stand or fall on their own merits.

Perhaps they were just playing Skyrim. I was going to say Quake or Doom but that would date me even more than my taste in cars.

Not long after we moved over here, my sons (then 4 and 6) and I found ourselves in the old Sheremetyevo terminal, trying to check in for a flight. It was madness. There were no staff on the 3 desks assigned to our flight, the crush was getting tighter and tighter, and the minutes were ticking away until the plane was due to leave. Then, when only 2 check-in staff arrived for the 3 desks, whatever space there had been between aspiring passengers disappeared as the mass of people surged towards the open desks. It was not a comfortable situation.

The Left Hand of Darkness is a true classic of science fiction and an important piece of literature. Classes are taught about this book, a simple Google search will reveal hundreds of articles of true criticism of the book, essays that discuss its place in history, study guides, book discussion outlines, etc. Where does this leave me – should I attempt to say what other people, people who know way more than I do, have already said? Should this review become a simple book report? I say no – do the Google search. You will find great, interesting and important information about The Left Hand of Darkness and Ursula K. Le Guin. What I will discuss is its relevance today, over 40 years after it was replaced. I will discuss why the young(er) fan of SFF books should read this classic that was published before they were born.

As your breath slows down, gently and in the most natural way, you feel yourself expanding through all realms, until you know your Self as part of all things, including the dance of littleness and limitation that is so much a part of the earth drama.

Elvis shook his hips, greased his hair into a ducktail and often had an expression that was a combination of a sneer and a pout. In the late 50s and early 60s, high school boys by the millions greased their hair back in ducktails and practiced the Elvis pout/sneer expression. A generation later, we had bands smearing their faces with makeup, spitting fire and barfing blood all over the stage. Then along came MTV and with it, video interpretations of songs that left very little to the imagination as far as sex and violence were concerned.

A foreign couple, a beautiful Franco-American woman and her Indian partner, vanish from the square one evening some time earlier. Their bodies are never recovered and the reports of their disappearance are, to say the least, contradictory. For example, Hassan’s friend, Aziz, “a waiter in the restaurant of the Riad Dar Timtam, in the heart of the medina,” describes the couple as follows:
There's a pool:

Unlike all the cultures of the Alpha-civilizations (Hindi, Sino, Western and Arab), primitive cultures, like those in Africa, have absolutely no innate relation to the 'Gestalt' ('form/content') of the modern world. So to get rid of all that is not originally yours is perfectly rational, if you want to 'find' your authentic self (identity) again. And this is precisely the reason why Mugabe is so admired by his peers in Africa. He has, like the prophet of yesteryear, shown them a way to forever overcome that which the modern environment has so ruthlessly foisted on them - without their implicit permission and pro-active participation.
4) Game play is like “War.” On each turn, each player flips over one card, and the cube is rolled. The players work together to determine whether the resulting compound statement is True or False. The winner keeps both cards.
You’ll hear a lot of people saying that Network Marketing or MLM or Multi-level Marketing is a numbers game. Yes, probably it was true 10-15 years ago when the market was totally different and Internet usage was less then 5% of population. You were presenting the products and marketing plan to huge number of people and you were getting some folks to sign-up and join your business. The ones that decided not to do it you just simply forgot about.

“Yes, right away,” Hannah said. After making one last check for dirty clothes in the bedrooms, she made her way down to the basement. The sparse room seemed dingy and damp, in stark contrast to the fresh spring day she had seen from her upstairs window. She’d much rather be outside, but the laundry must be done.

Maud was the old bay mare that Muck and Finn rode all over the country. They had no saddle, so they just went bareback, with Muck in the front holding the reins and Finn behind, holding onto Muck.

Making this meatloaf was a comedy of errors. I didn't realize when I was making it that I was out of eggs. It was dark and rainy outside and I had no desire to get in the car and drive to the supermarket to buy eggs. I did the unthinkable and walked down the street to CVS and bought the cheap eggs there. I like to think of myself as an egg snob who always buys fresh, local eggs. I felt so dirty buying CVS eggs. I felt less dirty when I paid for them. They were cheap to begin with, but I found out they were on sale. Eggs for under $2? I think I'm a convert!

For me EU citizenship isn’t just a legal framework that includes free movement or access to another member state’s consulate in a non-EU country. It is also a state of mind, idealism and a willingness to find common ground while acknowledging difference.

Robert shows on Tuesday mornings, backing his little van into my driveway, throws open the back door and pulls out his kit: a mower some weeks, a blower others, always a rake and a trimmer… He unlocks the gate and goes about his work and within an hour or so he is gone. All that I need to do is have handy the garden waste bin. Oh, and an espresso: I have him hooked on this once-a-week caffeine rush.
But what does God call us, who are called in 2 Corinthians 5:20 (NKJV) to be “…ambassadors for Christ…”, to do? First of all we are not to get too worked up and be filled with anger. Proverbs 24:17-22 (NKJV) instructs us to “…not rejoice when your enemy falls, And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles; Lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him, And He turn away His wrath from him. Do not fret because of evildoers, Nor be envious of the wicked; For there will be no prospect for the evil man; The lamp of the wicked will be put out.” God has this guys…He is in control.
Anyone else have the issue that the minute you get a great hand, you find yourself playing into someone else’s hand? Well, not that it mattered much here–the hand I played into was weak, so I didn’t lose that many points in comparison to the other rounds. ^^;
However the great news is that we do have control over the response we choose to have in relation to the circumstance. For example if our friend chooses to get angry and frustrated with us because of something we have done or said to them, we can choose to react with anger and unhappiness to them or we can take a much more empowering place and choose to believe that what is happening is good and isn’t it great that they are authentic with us. We can actively choose to respond with happiness, peace and love in this situation.

I wanted to start off with a bit of a pallet cleanser (a short one, it was!), so I chose OPI So Many Clowns... So Little Time from their Femme De Cirque collection. I added four coats & still the polish was not completely opaque. I love how milky it was, but would have enjoyed it more if my nails didn't have a slight yellow tint underneath. No base or top coat.

When we experience extreme stress or panic our rational thought processes are overridden by the adrenaline being pumped around our body. This affects decision making which means that although we feel exhilarated doing scary things we are unlikely to learn much from it.

Harry and I haven't been to many places since we had to have so much treatment for our illnesses and last time I visited, Weston Super Mare was still in turmoil with workmen everywhere while they finished putting in the superior sea defences and new walkways. The whole of the town seemed to be upside down for several years, so I was quite pleasantly surprised that it was all finished and not a workman, tractor or bulldozer anywhere in sight and it all looked very new and agreeable as well as safer for the people who live there.
We have been blogging for two months today! Wow. The time has flown, and we have learned a lot. We've also 'met' some amazing writers, and feel incredibly privileged to have been able to share our thoughts and our journey with you all. We wanted to say thank you. So. YAY! Thanks VERY much for all you help and support!!!!!! Second, we wanted to do something to mark the anniversary. We were going to do a contest, and I posted a poll last week to help us choose the prize. Then we started the Underappreciated YA Book Nomination Giveaway, and doing another contest lost its appeal.
(Also, for those who, like Jerramy and me, would love nothing more than to find a royal to marry, Jerramy has written a second book called Bright Young Royals which is a guidebook to the world’s single blue-bloods. I would have loved to have helped her research it.)
Dear Trevor,
The concept sounds ridiculous but the execution is actually quite good if a little shaky in some areas and there are more than a few laugh out loud moments. Unfortunately there are also some cringe-worthy moments but they are few in far between. Despite being incredibly short the game actually feels very complete and has a good intro, middle, and end, the story fitting together quite naturally.

What if healing can be found in ways we have never entertained? Even though I have never been much of a mainstream type of person, just like with my belief that Michael was invincible, I still seem to carry a barely buried belief that if he would just go through chemo, he would live a long and healthy happy ever after. Can I shake that belief and accept that there are healing methods which have helped people for thousands of years and which just might change my life and the life of my sweet hubby? I don't know how these things can help unless we open ourselves to them.

Look, I'm the queen of making small talk when I have to be. I can find something to talk about with a brick wall. That doesn't mean I want to. I believe everyone should have a 'social use' word limit and if you go over, you should shut the hell up for the rest of the day. Now, I'm not complaining because people spoke to me. I'm pissed because two different people TOUCHED me today. On purpose. Strangers. That is so off putting I don't know what to do with myself.
I've spent the past couple of days tacking and sewing bits of material into skirts. Why did I volunteer myself for this, I will never know. It's for costume for our Drama performance, and as we couldn't find suitable khaki skirts in the shops, I suggested we have a go at making them.

October 7 – We took the tube to Piccadilly Circus, walked around window shopping again – Regents, looked in Burberry (got my perfume, Weekends), and many other shops. That evening I met my friend from Fodors again, and we ate at a restaurant called Circus (£15 for three course pre-theater dinner). The food and company was wonderful (I hope we can get together on our next vacation!). After dinner we walked through Leicester Square, where she waited while I jumped in a cab back to the hotel.

Stay God was my love letter to Baltimore (I wrote it when I was living overseas and homesick.) The book follows Damon and Mary, who've spent their days slinging drugs behind the chipped counter of their junk-shop front and nights watching horror movies, going to bars, and generally wasting time. They're usually joined by Damon's best friend, Christian. Mary begins to tire of the routine and wants to get away from The Life, but Damon, adverse to any sort of change and commitment, isn't so keen. Copious amounts of drugs are snorted, horror movies discussed in existential terms, much blood spilled, Baltimore's neighborhoods sightseen, and many a body drops. It's my mutant flipper baby of a novel, a combination of crime, satire, social commentary, horror and Evil Dead. In it's blackened little heart, though, it's really a frightening love story. It's about a man trying to temper his selfish and self-destructive tendencies for the woman he loves.
The thing I really love about the Redonkulous images is how great they are to colour - they have just the right level of detail. I've gone for primary tones on this one and I'm pleased with how it turned out.

So, I'm not reading trans blogs as much as I would like,I dont know,I always feels that the day passes too quickly and thaat I miss a lot of things,maybe it is because I have a hard time to concentrate or focus in something...I watch some youtube videos about but usually got myself thinking of thousand of things while I watch a girl and have no idea of what she said,and end up having to watch the video again,and if it is too long,dont watch it until the end,even if I really want to watch it,Im loosing my desire on doing those things more then before,maybe is the feelings of depression getting stronger.My mom was talking to my grandfather that my brother and I are too alone and that they are worried.I like that they worry about me,I wish I got the strength to explain what is happening to them,or that they force me to do it somehow...
Well, it's Friday night but High School is over (for us) and the football game days are behind us. I miss the flood lights and sitting behind the popular kids with my popular friend... who is now my business partner, Emily. Just to hang out in her world was such a thrill! I felt like such a dork.

To make sure that the audience really gets it, you should incorporate the Rule of Three while revealing your character’s money-hungry nature. For example, if she’s a pick pocket, maybe she gets away with it twice, and gets caught the third time. She’s unapologetic when caught, the song changes, and then she continues to reveal her obsession with money throughout the act.

Deep down, you had a feeling your leather trousers might be a tad on the tight side when you bought them, but you had no idea they would be this tight. Here's some free advice the next time you find yourself in the leather trouser section of your local supermarket: Always try them on while sporting a raging hard-on. Oh, and no half chubs or one quarter wood, I'm talking a fully erect member up in this motherscratcher. When the guys at say, the Anvil or the Ramrod, start to grind up against you on the dance floor, you want to make sure the inevitable boner you unfurl stays within the smooth confines of your leather trousers. Of course, the chances of your cock and some of your balls escaping the leathery grip of your pants are pretty remote. But still, you want to maintain an air of dickish dignity, while, at the same time, keeping the contents of your package firmly under wraps, as no-one likes a show off, especially in a place like, the Cockpit. If you think leather trousers sound complicated, honey, you ain't seen nothing yet. How do you think the ambitious heterosexual NYPD patrolman at the centre of Cruising, one who probably thinks listening to Chic automatically makes you a card-carrying Friend of Dorothy, is gonna react when he's given the opportunity to hopscotch his way to detective? Pretty excited, I guess. Wait a second, did you just say, "hopscotch his way"? Burn my "Cher's first facelift commemorative dishrag" with an acetylene torch, but that sounds a little gay? Oh, it's gay all right. In fact, it's so gay, you'll be asking Powers Boothe about the coloured-coded world of back pocket bandanas in no time. While a lot of straight men, particularly the one's who lived in New York City circa 1980, wouldn't be too pleased about the prospect of donning a black undershirt in order to catch a serial killer, I, on the other hand, would have jumped at the chance to be exceedingly fabulous at the height of disco; well, the tail end of disco.
Hello again! I'm back with another card for the CC over at Skraplagret. This time a colour challenge. Only use Green, White, Black, Blue, Yellow and red, in other words the colour of the logo for Scraplagret. You also had to cut something out from a designer paper and one of by butterflies are cut out. My b....y hands don't want to work with me today, so I had to keep that part to a minimum. I had a totally different design in mind when I started this card but life and kids happened on the way and I kind of made a simple version of my minds version. Hmmm, did that make sense in any way?

Totally wrong about Adam McVey. But I was right that the SNP idea of standing two candidates at once was going to backfire. Counting the first preference votes by party, the SNP got 27.8% and Labour got 27.2%, suggesting strongly that Rob Munn didn’t get re-elected pretty much just because the SNP decided to have two candidates. Half a point. (Also Steve Cardownie, nearly.)

Nonetheless, most of the doctors involved (certainly all the neurologists) expected that—if she decided she wanted to continue—eventually a feeding tube would be needed for nourishment as swallowing would become impossible, and a respirator would be needed to breathe for her because breathing would also become impossible.

Becky made her decisions and signed forms indicating “Do Not Resuscitate.”
We finished downstairs and went upstairs, (crazy people that we are, we were doing it in the wrong order) and went through the living room, bedroom, bathroom and kitchen showrooms.

I've been doing research the last few days. I've had an e-mail exchange with the Archeaogoddess, and done a lot of thinking, and I'm so conflicted about it all. Part of me wants to throw up my hands and say "Fuck it, I'm never going to feel better" and curl into a ball in my bed and never come out. But, I'm a mom, so that's not really an option.
My husband put the shelves together while I pulled all of the bins out of the closet to get them ready for their new homes. I reorganized a few of them and pulled out some of the other items what would fit well on the shelves. I know that my kids play with their things more when they are easily accessible, so I'm okay with having their things out. I just want them to look neat and be easy for them to clean up.
One classic example of a MacGuffin is the black bird statuette in the film, “The Maltese Falcon.” Another is the Ark of Covenant in “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” Yet another is the sled, Rosebud, in “Citizen Kane.” A MacGuffin is a kind of holy grail, sometimes literally, as in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” or “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”

Life has been hectic. My family is still working through the loss of my father-in-law. PJ made another trip with his sister to take care of things at the house, etc. I'm continuing to work on organizing my home, and trying to plan a graduation celebration for my youngest. He actually received his diploma in the fall, but we were waiting until good weather so that family could come. He has been accepted into a very good college and will be living there, starting in August. I am going to feel a little lost with both sons gone from home. I do have a long list of new hobbies I want to try, and maybe even take an online course myself, so I plan on keeping very busy. Even doing that, I know it will be a huge adjustment for me!

definition 3. Okay — now we’re talking, and not about the “famous” French cuisine (though the food certainly fits with this one, as well). Let me repeat this definition — strikingly, excitingly, or mysteriously different or unusual. If I apply this definition to this place, I would have to say that I couldn’t say it any better — it describes perfectly the environment that surrounds me. Because I cannot say things as simply as Mr. Webster, I will devote much more time and effort to describe this place that is far from south Santa Monica, the place where I cut my teeth on a surfboard. But first…
The palate was rich and voluptuous with ripe black fruit, a freshening note from the cassis like acidity and some clean, firm structure from the firm tannic shell, which will soften, but actually really suits it right now as it is not harsh, quite smooth actually and, along with the coffee and spice notes from the oak, just holds the fruit in check.
In this house, ordering a pizza is always a multi-step process. First, there's deciding to have take-out instead of cooking. I always feel badly about ordering dinner when there's perfectly cookable food in the refrigerator, so this first step tends to take a while as I go back and forth. Once my laziness has conquered my guilt, there's the matter of deciding where to order. Somehow, despite only having about five take-away places near our house, this is always a lengthy conversation. After we've decided on pizza, it's a fifteen minute wait for pick-up. Then another 15 minutes after that to get the pizza home.

Wash chicken. Trim fat where necessary. Preheat oven to 325. Pour stock half a little less than a 1/2 inch deep into an oven-safe pan. Carefully place the trimmed chicken in the pan and brush BBQ sauce onto the top of the chicken. Pour a little stock over the chicken and put it into the oven for slightly less than hour, turning the chicken over half-way through and then brushing BBQ sauce onto that side. Make sure you check your chicken often especially towards the end to guarantee tenderness!

The second, or third, piece of cake. The gaucho pants that were on the clearance rack. The W tattoo. The agreement to jump off the bridge if all your other friends would.
I have learnt profound lessons in the last couple of days and the depth of the simple statement by Sai Baba - “First Understanding, Then Adjustment ” echoes in my ears from the bottom of my heart even as I am typing this.

Me: First off, the rat poison story has no evidence other than her word. People can be excellent liars. And even if the story were true, if she was not a Christian, then why did she not die? Only disciples of Jesus with the utmost faith could drink poison and live, not someone not of the faith, so your example is moot. As well, if you really do have faith in Jesus, then do as that girl did and drink rat poison. According to her and Jesus, you should be fine. Do it. If you don’t believe that it can be done when you do it, then you don’t have 100% faith in Jesus Christ, your own Lord and Saviour. “I’m sure that if god wanted to give me the power to withstand cyanide in a way that would expand his kingdom and bring glory to him then he would.” He would be expanding his kingdom, because I would become a believer on the spot, but you won’t, because you know that if you drink rat poison or cyanide, you will either die a very slow death or live and be rushed to the hospitals where doctors, not god, would save you, but I’m sure you would chalk it up to your imaginary friend anyway.
Based on their general records (and the first two’s performance in the oral arguments), it seems extraordinarily unlikely that Justices Roberts, Alito, and Thomas would rule against the Georgia authorities. But the other six justices engaged in a wide-ranging and quite interesting discussion—asking challenging questions of both sides—of whether the immunity for grand jury testimony is proper. It’s dangerous to make any predictions based on oral arguments, but the Court’s four more liberal members, along with Justice Scalia, didn’t reject the plaintiff’s arguments out of hand.

Albert rejected the city that had been faithful to him and had supported him. He sold out for more money. I truly believe that had Albert stayed with the Birds, he would have gone down in history as the favorite player of all time. This is saying a lot considering guys like Stan Musial, Ozzie Smith and Rogers Hornsby played there.
While I'm stretched out comfortably on the couch, feet propped up nicely onto the ottoman, typing away- spiderman is frozen on the tv in a really awkward scene of an old lady with a look of terror on her face, the baby is sleeping upstairs in her crib underneath the ceiling fan which must never ever be turned off or the entire household will drown in a lake of my sweat, and the rest of the bunch is out back blowing up a volcano dinosaur water park that we picked up at Target yesterday for $30.
She's taken a space that had little to recommend it, worked her butt off remodelling on a budget, creatively used totally cool finds, and has worked some sort of private unbelievable magic, the genes for which sadly skipped me.

The office of canonization of Schema-Archbishop Anthony (Abashidze; +1942) as a locally venerated saint was performed during the divine service. Archbishop Alexander read out the decision of the Holy Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of 14 June 2011 (minutes 21) to enter the name of Schema-Archbishop Anthony into church calendar. Archbishop Antoniy of Borispol told all those present about the life of the saint. His icon was brought to the middle of the church, and His Beatitude, archpastors, clergymen and laymen venerated the relics of the newly canonized saint, website of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church reports.

I would like the Dutchman to stay – you want the best players at Arsenal – but if he feels that he cannot fulfil his career at The Emirates then he will leave. Despite much media speculation, I don’t envisage any circumstance where Arsenal would sell to Manchester City, certainly not at the £25m being quoted in the media. That just does not make football sense, releasing a key player to a rival team at market value does not reflect the premium surely payable. The club would be looking to add a third to that fee for selling to a Premier League team or so it seems it ought to be from the comfort of this desk and chair.
London is always off doing something covert (and, really, don't his stealthy secret missions account for at least a quarter of his hotness?), but don't worry, he still gets a ton of page time.
And, how do the Stalinists of the AWL respond to this regime of torture, being carried out by those who, just months ago, they were giving uncritical support to?

While we’re on the topic of cut-offs, I think it’s important to say that not only are the small cut-offs okay, but they are recommended, for those same reasons (shows that you are listening and interested, people like when you’re interested in whatever they are talking about, whether or not you really are. Pretend)
Two years ago when Jules was in pre-school and Mia was in first grade we were strolling through Target looking for back packs and lunch kits. I suggested that they not choose a character backpack b/c we were not getting a new back back until theirs fell apart. And, there was good chance that they might not be super excited to carry around a Winnie the Poo back back in 3rd grade.

That was 1998, and this is 2012. This has tormented me for 14 years, and I suspect that in a cruel twist of fate, it will take another 19 until this is resolved.

I don’t really know where to start with this book, or what to think about it, even though I know I really liked it. It’s a really sad and heartbreaking story, and I read most of it yesterday while I was having a bad day and ended up putting it down, because I was just so annoyed with one of the characters. Why? Because this book isn’t a fairy tale; its part romance, part coming of age/finding yourself novel, and for a book that is part romance, it’s very realistic – the ending isn’t all rainbows and butterflies, and I just needed me a happy ending yesterday. But this is supposed to be a positive, so I’ll get on with it.

So I was happy, but still a little bummed about the pink one. When I opened my cute Copic pencil case lo and behold, there was a Pink Multiliner SP inside! HA! Also a .35 black Multiliner SP which is the only one I didn't have in my set. In addition to these bonuses, every colour marker in my kit was new for me! I've added them to my Copic List already. The only colour I already had was B29, but I had it in sketch, and got it in a Wide in my kit. I also got Copic Original V06 and V09, Copic Ciao Y11, and Copic Sketch and Refill,Y04.

"A New Year has this useful thing about it, whether it be Mohammedan, Hebrew, Julian, Gregorian, Chinese, or Choctaw. It makes man remember and regret his follies and his sins." I need to point out that it is a very different thing to regret our sins and to regret our follies. The rite for dealing with the former is much better established than that dealing with the latter. Sins can be forgiven; our follies are ever forgotten. Men with few sins can have many follies, while great sinners can be relatively free of follies. Yet, Belloc reminds us, both are to be acknowledged. This passage, indeed, reminds me of a line of Chesterton who said, if I recall it correctly, that "we can be sorry for our sins but not for spilling gravy on our ties in a fine restaurant." The latter is not a sin, but it is a folly. We do regret the bad figure we cut with gravy stains on our ties.
And of course, in addition to these lineups, we will be seeing the Boulevard Wheat backpack kegs making their rounds and delivering something besides plastic Vortex bottles to fans in their seats.

Nevertheless, Enduring Romance is on a few of the Big Boy Publishers mailing lists and I still get ARCs out of the blue, just automatic sends, I guess. I figure it's not the authors' faults the publishers didn't check out our policy here and, being an author, I know authors got to eat and usually have a few hungry mouths to feed. So, I'll tell you about their books anyway, if I have time.

Are you victorious in Christ?, or are you finding that your Christian life is a bit more challenging that you would of hoped for. I must say that many Christians today, feel the same way and it is real. Sometimes we look at our fellow brothers and sisters and they seem so at peace, everything in their lives are rosy and prosperous. Sometimes we even have fight our inner struggles because jealousy creeps in, we find ourselves despising our thoughts because of its evil intent. I am even sure that many of us will never even admit to having these thoughts but who are we fooling, God knows your heart and knows your thoughts, so just be honest to God and ask Him. Why is it that others can be so peaceful and content or blessed and overjoyed and I’m not?.

Also, the proportion of women criminals is higher among Negroes. 19.1 per cent of the Negro criminals committed in 1910 were women, and 7.2 per cent of the whites were women, or one out of every five Negro criminals was a female, one out of every thirteen white criminals was a female.

Musicians and bands needs to connect their music marketing with an understanding of how they were able to make a fan, create a buzz with some one and get that fan to share, tell others to buy your music or why they keep coming back.

I had been on my knees washing the floor when the door bell rang, this was odd, I never got visitors. I thought that it was probably a sales man, so I left it but when the door bell continued to ring I had let the curiosity get the best of me. Stopping in the hall to make sure my makeup had not faded I walked to the door and opened it. There standing in the door was Jamie, Jamie with her long black hair, petit form, and her usual vibrate lips. I felt a warm smile; a real smile, spread across my lips. “Geez Jamie, you should have let me know you were coming to town.” I jokingly scolded her.

Perhaps I’ve gone far afield of the original subject, but it seemed some preamble was in order. I’ve come to realize that anticipating a jump to conclusions has become necessary in blogging and guess there’s nothing to be done for that but learn to address it in fewer words. I’ll aim high, meanwhile my favorite 2008 post at Writhe Safely remains this one, but I won’t submit that since it’s pure link love, I didn’t write anything. My own best typing in 2008 combines social criticism with personal confession (and if you think I exaggerate the violence of online antipsychiatry read that thread) but will submit this instead with a thought for public service. If you come away from that convinced of what I stand for you are privy to a truth that is not even in my own possession. Why would you want that responsibility? Just think about the post, not a bunch of interesting ideas about the person who wrote it.

I wrote a script that takes place in an office. It always gets compared to OFFICE SPACE or THE OFFICE. Were there really on two office stories that needed to be told? It makes you think how groundbreaking OFFICE SPACE was. I can imagine that Mike Judge had to convince a bunch of skeptical executives that people might actually be interested in what happens in an office – because it have never been done before.

Part of the extinction process was as a result of being retreated into areas that could not sustain them; European diseases (particularly tuberculoses) for which they had no immunity; and anecdotes of genocide in which they were hunted like wolves. Indeed, the extinction of such a shy, peaceful and unique people is a black mark in Canadian history.

I couldn’t believe that I had spent the last three years acting like a total jerk to this girl for no real reason. Just because it was socially acceptable didn’t make it ok, and in the end I really did like her. If I hadn’t given in to the social pressure of popularity, I would have found my best friend earlier. I am so thankful that we were able to see beyond the reputation other kids had given us, and see each other for who we really were.

I for one most certainly can relate to this feeling. However, in my experience this attitude towards conflicts does not lead to solutions, and when the conflict finally is resolved I rarely end up getting my way. So what should I do then? What is the secret behind winning a conflict? Obviously, survival of the fittest still applies. So the question is really, how do you survive a conflict, and ensure that your ideas and values are not killed by the other party?

I didn’t have time to practice my speech before I left, so I figured I’d do it on the plane. Yeah, right. It had been so many years since I’d flown that I didn’t realize how impossible it was to do anything on a flight except get through the hours. When my idea of studying my speech on the plane didn’t work out, I figured I could do it once I got to St. Simons. That would have been a good idea except for . . . Did I mention this was a resort area? Right on the ocean? In the south? I went for a walk on the beach, and happened upon a trolley leaving for a tour of the island. I hopped aboard and was entertained with tales (and some tall tales) of the island’s history. When we returned, I was still in tourist mode, so I went to the lighthouse, and walked up all 129 steps to the top. And so the time went.

Let’s all sit back and think for a second about how dark of a sub-plot was just introduced at this half-point of the season involving one of the children heroes of the show. Jaqen H’gar is granting her the ability to kill three people that she chooses. And Arya is gladly accepting this offer. Arya winds up going down one of the most morally grey paths of the entire main cast (of the good guys anyways), and this is the beginning. Here is a child (for her character is much younger than the actress) ordering the cold-blooded assassinations of other men. She’s not killing them in self-defense or in a duel. She’s having them murdered. These are really evil men, but still. George R. R. Martin and HBO are continuing the trend from last week of not being afraid to have their kids do some really fucked up shit. What’s said is that I know the ultimate consequences of Arya choosing to kill some people instead of others, but I want get into spoilers. Also, I know just how dark this girl’s story is going to keep going and how relatively tame this is compared to things she’ll willingly be doing herself later in the show. If Maisie Williams continues to handle this material as maturely as she has this season, she could really gain a reputation as one of the capable young actresses in Hollywood handling disturbing material. She could wind up with the same kind of following as Chloe Grace Moretz in that regard.

Most voters and candidates for office do not know that probation conditions may require an offender to wear one of a variety of electronic monitors capable of enforcing house arrest, detecting the use of alcohol, or of tracking a subject's movements in real time using global positioning satellites (GPS). Probation offenders are almost always required to get and keep a job, to refrain from using alcohol or drugs, to submit to regular drug testing, and, to attend court ordered classes, and to submit to substance abuse treatment while confined if the judge deems it necessary.
In recent weeks, a range of humanitarian organisations have expressed concern at the deteriorating situation in Libya. One of the most respected organisations, Medicins Frontiers, whose bravery in going into war torn areas, to provide medical relief, is unsurpassed, has recently pulled out of Misrata, because they were finding that they were being asked to patch up hundreds of political prisoners, who had been brutally tortured, only in order for their captors, in the new regime, to continue torturing them further!
