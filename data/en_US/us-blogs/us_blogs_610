With his back still turned and his spraycan finishing a labia, he lifted his other hand and gave me the bird. I shat myself, ducked and spent the next twenty minutes squatting on top of a closed toilet, whimpering a little bit.

There are women, close and far, who have caught my eye. I keep it... clean... in my mind. I can't be distracted by the wrong woman or the wrong approach. These things start in the mind, trust me. I can't neglect myself, and if I am going to even pretend or more actually have care for this woman, I can't neglect her, either. Until she is a wife, she is a sister... or... at least... fourth cousin, twice removed, through marriage? Something. She is general kin. Or... must be treated that way. When she is my wife, she becomes a part of me. Things do... change. Oh, you wouldn't think I would know this? Fie.
This is the tragedy of the Iranian Revolution of 1979. After the mobilization of masses of Iranians toppled the authoritarian regime of the Shah, the Islamists led by Khomeini outmaneuvered other democratic, secular, leftwing forces and seized power. The mullahs initiated a counter-revolution that pushed the country in a regressive direction, back towards the restoration of a feudal theocratic rule of which the only thing new is it’s being propped up by the worst modern instruments of state repression.

The other things they discovered during my exam is that I have excellent hearing for someone my age (which is a minor miracle considering how I've totally abused my ears with The Rock and Roll for many years) and that I have a "nodule" on my thyroid (probably nothing) that I'm having ultrasounded on Friday morning.
From time beginning, there has been confusion. That is not necessarily a bad thing. It precedes change. And change brings upliftment and Light. It has always been that way and it is no different now, except that change is much more dramatic and the Light much brighter in these drastically changing times you find yourselves in now.

Of course our goal is to attain liberation and enlightenment in this lifetime. But that goal seems so far off and so unattainable (this I need to work on), that sometimes it is not a very motivating goal because it seems undoable. In contrast, getting to the pure land when I die (or before) definitely seems something that is doable, and VGL has said that it is possible for me (and I have received other signs). So for me, this seems quite doable, and as such it drives me. Reaching the pure land itself has almost the same effect as liberation and enlightenment, because once we reach it, we are free from uncontrolled rebirth, our enlightenment is guarranteed, and all of our experiences are pure.
PS will give update on what I have found out, who I have spoken to etc. RPOA of Texas (see below) can use donations. Whatever you can give. But I do have some tentative good news. Just not out of the woods. Now I need to get hold of all the vets in my town, see who belongs to VMA and try to get hold of it's president. I liken it to Obama stating the AMA was behind his healthcare plan. Very low percent of docs belong to the AMA anymore. So we shall see. I smell a rat in the VMA, so need to have Texas vets come together and see what this is all about. Not paying attention is a lot easier, but...some things are worth fighting. Lots of things actually)

You are probably thinking by now that you should have sewn the straps to the back first, so it would be easier to pin the correct length at the front - and you are totally right! That is a much easier way to do it if you are trying it on yourself. With a dress form you can do either, and with a client it is more appropriate to pin at the back.

In the past I have said that Atheists are organizing as a religion. Then I posted something about a Court decision that said that Atheism is a religion! Then we all read the article about Richard Dawkins when Carl Packman said "Dawkins, in choosing a form of firebrand fundamentalist atheism over the discipline science, is no longer the champion of reason but rather a kind of evangelical against religion"
Then came last week. After adding another bag of “mulch” onto our rapidly growing potatoes, I began to wonder what kind of mulch was best for growing potatoes. After hours of disheartening research on the internets, I was ale to uncover the reality that one should never use wood mulch, especially mulch from conifers (like cedar), in gardening. Apparently the wood raises the acidity of the soil as it decays, thus hurting the plants growing in it. When potato growers used the word “mulch” they meant straw or compost; something organic that has been chopped up or composted to a soft, soil-like consistency, not the basic wood mulch found in most garden centers.

Due to the violent/mature nature of this novel, I'm unsure whether this should be for Young Adults at all. An adult could easily read this novel and still find it uncomfortable reading at times. On the other hand, it's refreshing to see a YA author who doesn't talk down or dumb down their work.
Since then, Hot Rod has toured the world doing shows in markets such as Turkey, England, France, Australia, United Arab Emerites, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, China, Denmark and countless territories around the world.

By the time the day was done, Harvi was dog tired. This had been by far the toughest quest of all. He measured the milk collected for the day. He was still just short of the target set by Geryon. He quickly put in some water to make up for the deficit and he was good to go. Geryon was impressed with his performance and the cows joined the mares and stallions on the muck fortress. Harvi was all set to make it on time for his date with his old friend, the Greek king also known as the reptilian alien shape changer.

The more I think about the pain I am in, the more I think it's a muscle based pain. It reminds me of when I had my port relocation in 2010 and went back to the gym too soon. I just had to take it easy for a few weeks and it went away. I think that is what it is, seeing as I'm keeping food and water down and the pain is only at night after I've been running around all day. I'm doing a lot more than I have in months due to my broken foot and bed rest.
One reason is that it has been replaced with “climate change” and the other reason is that the only people talking about climate change seem to be leaders of governments like the United States or Australia.

However, I'm also totally exasperated that instead of using a whole world of pointless hyperbole - like calling it a 'premium plus' experience - they didn't focus on what makes it so different, which really is PR 101 and something that they really need to focus on communicating if they want to try and claw back some sort of credibility.

Food: I imagine they eat lots of sweet, delicious food at the North Pole so that is just what we had at our breakfast. There were white powdered donuts, cinnamon rolls, strawberry muffins, yogurt parfaits, French toast sticks and hot cocoa. My kids were so excited to see all of the treats and couldn’t believe I was going to let them eat all this for breakfast!

2. Have you implemented the advice and suggestions from agents or publishers to improve you and your book?
Here…If no one else gives you one, this is for YOU:
I remember that I received books 3 & 4 for Christmas, 1980. The Tombs Of Kobol adapted the two-part "Lost Planet of the Gods," while The Young Warriors adapted and slightly expanded upon the episode of the same name. Both of these books sported rather nice (and TV-accurate) wrap-around cover paintings by sci-fi artist David Shleinkofer.
I got the chance to go back to the Eastwood Invitational after many, many years. 25 years ago I won this meet in the 3200 and the meet is still going strong and better than ever. I got a chance to see many of my old competitors and my old coach, Doug Littlejohn. It was great to see the EW runners in action for the first time.
Once again, I've decided to participate in the Red Heart Special Olympics Scarf Project. Care to join me? You all know I love a good craft for charity project and last year after I sent my scarf in I received a very nice thank-you note with photos of some of the athletes wearing the scarves they received, which made all my work that much more meaningful.
Back to the homework example - I don't want my kids to do their homework because I've yelled at them to do it. I want them to choose to do their work because they know they'll get a good grade if they do and because they know they'll have to make up the assignment, or get an incomplete, or get a detention if they choose not to do it. Natural consequences.
Coni was named Champion Pleasure Mare at our county Fair that year, and my young friend came home with a large trophy that she proudly displayed for all to see, I was quite surprised with her win because I though personally, I was showing the winning horse ( shows how much a judge's opinion differs from mine...).

I think one of my barn friends thought it was a little harsh to let her feel a rail if she took one. BUT...look at the last picture. These are 8 foot long rails. They're not that thick. They are much lighter than a real stadium rail. Klein is a big pony. I don't think her knocking one of those with no boots on would really hurt her, do you? If I did I would never do it. I have heard the stories of BNT's using metal rails, "poleing" horses aka hitting them in the knees as they go over a fence to make sure they get their knees up, putting rail road ties in front of rails so a horse could possibly hit one if they get lazy. THOSE are unacceptable. A thin 8ft long rail in shallow plastic jump cups, is not. And, if she didn't learn I wouldn't do it either. I know there are some horses out there that either wouldn't learn or wouldn't care enough to stop taking rails. It took once for Klein.
We have been given the authority to perform miracles through Jesus, maybe we would see more of them occurring in our communities if we focused on the kingdom effect and not just the physical sign itself.

Since 2001 the major preoccupation of the process has been the establishment of sound funding for this portfolio of projects and programs. To this end, the International Consortium on the Cooperative Development of the Nile (ICCON) was created and held its first meeting in Geneva (ICCON 1) in June 2001, at which it received pledges from donors of US$120 million over a six to eight-year time frame. ICCON’s long-term aim as a partnership of riparian states and the international community is to promote joint funding, transparency, and more broadly to raise support for the NBI. One of the key process issues is the establishment of a multidonor Nile Basin Trust Fund to provide “streamlined, cost-effective funding … which would consolidate donor support and ensure the clarity and cohesiveness of the program” (NBI, 2000). Following Parliamentary approval of the NBI’s new international organization status under Ugandan law in September 2002, it was envisaged that the NTF would shortly come under the management of the Nile Basin Secretariat.
As ever with cabaret there was a mixed bad. Compared pretty spectacularly by Radio 6 DJ Shaun Keaveny we got to enjoy the delights of:
"Hoffmann’s sharp and intelligent scripting cuts an enjoyable black humour. It’s well balanced in its swings between laughter and the sudden entrance of seriousness and tragedy. There’s a self-awareness that gives the story an integrity it might otherwise lack...The result is that the heart of the play opens up as a fragile, vulnerable and innocent coming of age, suggesting what this time of life has to offer and why we are drawn to it. 4 STARS" Whatsonstage

So, what thanks do I get? Huh? I'll tell you what thanks, bub. This is the general transcript of the conversation I had with OG whilst lying in bed with her last night:
So they had this kind of love-hate relationship with the both of us. Heather stopped me one day though, as I was tooling around on my bike, I was in about grade 5, she laughed, but not in a nice way like she was going to give me what for. She showed me a flyer of a punk-rock guy holding an izod shaped stuffed-animal with a noose around its throat and he was touching its neck with a knife, his shirt said, “Die Preppy!” It didn’t have the effect she thought it would. It was instant love for me. Finally! I thought. YES! I didn’t want people to die, I just was so sick of the stupid structure that I didn’t see a way out of until I saw that. I saw a freedom that I was determined to pursue. There is another way to be and I will be it.
The Cape Dutch or the Afrikaner in the Cape. They have never ever had a struggle for freedom for independence. Never. It was the Boers that had it. And the Boers came & started the Boer Republics. They lived there peacefully. When the war came - the Anglo-Boer War. Thousands of people in the Cape - the Cape Dutch helped the British against the Boers. So they were our enemy. We can not stand with our enemy & call them together. They are our enemy tomorrow. They say: "you can't really fight this you can't really do that." you know. We got to make up our minds & decide we want to do this we want to go & do that we want our country back. We can not let them negotiate you know. We can't let them negotiate for us because we will loose. We will loose everything. It's a very difficult situation. To take back South Africa is totally ludicrous in today's world. If a third world war breaks out then by all means nobody will have a chance against the Boers because nobody in Europe or America will lift a finger of whatever we do down here because they will be fighting each other shooting with atomic weapons & you name it. They will not have a minute - they will not have a second to worry about what's happening in the rest of Africa. But at the moment everybody talking about retaking the whole of South Africa they are nuts. Like the HNP. The Herstigte National Party. They're nuts. There's a saying going around amongst some of the right wing people in Southern Africa. The only time the Boer Nation really will be saved is when those that are trying or those leaders - or those who believe they are leaders who are trying to save us today are actually dead. Only then will we be able to be saved. We will get rid of all of these old ideas & old stigmas then the Boer Nation will sit up say wow let's rethink everything. That's where I am coming from.
Last year we had a family with a boy that had no bed; he slept on a mattress on the floor. We worked to get him a bed, and we had it before Christmas. Another year we had a family that we bought them a Christmas tree and they had no ornaments. We bought the ornaments and the lights to cover the tree as well.

The Dot is a really horrible character. There’s a real “Hero of the Beach” muscle-mag attitude that women are passive objects to be competed over by men. While the Line and the Squiggle enter into this honestly and without actually being mean to each other, the Dot is a spoilt, malicious creature who abuses anyone who doesn’t satisfy her incessant demands for novelty. I hope the poor Squiggle finds somebody more his own speed and settles down into a life of creative anarchy.

Once the temple that was Jesus was destroyed, it was rebuilt. First it was seen as Jesus’ resurrected body but after that a new temple was built; God’s glory dwelt throughout whole world through the Holy Spirit living in those who believed in Jesus. Jesus had promised on the night before he died that anyone who loved him would obey him and as a result God and Jesus would dwell in them. God’s temple is now the Church, the Church being the people not the building, however beautiful that building might be.

Paroc Oy AB v OHIM Case T-157/08, General Court, 8 February 2011 (unreported)
I’ve never worked out to “look good” for a guy (trying to impress a new one, or fear of losing one); I always do it for myself. But the right guy appreciating it? That’s a great feeling and added bonus. You gotta give your man something to brag about haha Don’t you want him to be proud and point you out to his boys, like “yeah, that’s all me.” Or for his boys to compliment him on how good you look? Or all the while, even if no one says it (bc you don’t need recognition), you just kinda have that secret confidence on the inside?? I know I do. I don’t try to look better than anyone in the office, but I feel much better when I’ve been working out & really feel like I can take on the list of tasks thrown at me in the office. So even if I’m not utilizing my physical strength in the office…it still helps somehow. (Should I list how much I can bench and squat on my resume next to Excel skills? No? ok.)
The exhibitors and most of the attendees are there to do business. The exhibitors all have products or services they wish to sell, and you could see them taking care of business, seated with potential customers, speaking in hushed tones. You will be able to obtain ample brochures and flyers, and my own bag was quite heavy by the end of the day, stuffed with information about many different vendors. Many of the products displayed at the show may end up at local restaurants or grocery stores so you might be getting advance notice of something special.
That's all the deepness I can handle this morning.

Every politician in Congress and those competing for the presidency know George W. Bush became president because he and Carl Rove found a way to identify Bush with the Christian Right, but to get this blessing one must also be Israel blessed. Even today 70% of Republicans support Bush and his war in Iraq because what is left of the Republican Party is predominantly Judeo-Christian.
All in all, today was a stellar day.
I grew a pair today and decided that today would be the day I ate...no, MADE....dim sum. I planned to make 5 different types; two chicken, one beef, one pork and one shrimp plus possibly a sweet one. I defrosted the meat and got to work in the dough for the pork buns. Halfway through assembling I said "screw it!, pork and beef plus dessert is enough!". I spent the better part of 3 hours preparing the dim sum but it was worth it and I can't wait to do it again. Next time though I will stagger the preparations over a couple of days so on the day I just have to prepare the yeasted rolls and cook the rest of the stuff.

Reitman has a way of mixing humor with his serious true to life topics that very few have been able to do. Although labeled as comedy films there is a deep seriousness among all the story lines. His movies have a new John Hughes feel with not quite as much silliness and out right comedy but they still send a message non the less.Name Your Link"> Young Adult is not quite as masterful a picture as was Juno or Up In The Air but it’s fine entertainment regardless. It’s uncomfortable feelings will have you cringing in discomfort and laughing while doing so. You will find yourself pulling for Mavis to get herself aligned while also hoping she falls on her face. It’s a film worth your time but don’t expect it to blow you away, it will just leaving feeling not too bad about your situation because on the surface everyone else looks better off but we all got problems, some just deal with them better than others.

He downs an entire package of Pop Rocks, then takes a huge swig of the soda that the professor hands him. Awwww, Pacey's still alive!

These changes are not necessarily being experienced by everyone concurrently, for instance, a very small percentage of adults have already embodied a further 2 strands of DNA (as at 2001) and are now beginning to move into fourth dimensional awareness. This physical change in our state of being is completely dependent upon our current level of consciousness, therefore, as we lift our perceptions to embrace ever increasing levels of truth and higher thought, so we embody further strands of DNA. This entire process is managed by our I AM presence or higher self, so we are in extremely capable and loving hands, and must therefore, learn to surrender to it.
1) There is a tremendous hope and optimism amongst the Sudanese before they come to the United States. The film highlights the first year in America for two of the Sudanese Lost Boys. They’re called Lost Boys because they’re parents and sisters were killed or kidnapped and they were left to wander in Southern Sudan. After a few years of wandering, they came to a refugee camp in Kenya and from there they came to the USA. Before they come here, they are very optimistic. They’re desire is to come here, get an education, and then return to their homeland to establish a New Sudan. I don’t think a lot of us really understand how important their homeland is to them. Like for me, I’m a total mutt. I’m part Swedish, part Greek, part Dutch, part German, part Norwegian and God knows what else. It’s really hard for me to feel any kind of attachment to my homeland because I’m only the third generation that was born here and my family’s homelands are on the other side of the world. Furthermore, because of the Melting Pot effect in the USA, I really don’t have the same kind of attachment to a distinctive culture that the Sudanese do. They have a deep, deep love for their homeland and their people, it’s just as much a part of them as their gender, hair color, etc.
It is not merely mortality but “what is mortal” that is “swallowed up by life.” I emphasize the “what is…” because it seems you do not believe the body itself is resurrected. Yet, “what is” mortal is the body. As I had pointed out previously, it is our currently lowly, humiliated body which will be transformed. (Php 3:21) What is there to transform if there is no body? How can “what is mortal” be swallowed up by life if there is no mortal body to swallow up? Paul repeatedly states that we “put on” immortality on top of our current body. Our resurrection means the “redemption of our body” (Romans 8:23) and the quickening of our “mortal bodies.” (Romans 8:11)

That last evening, we again chose a restaurant in Chelsea. This time we went for Spice, a Thai restaurant that had great reviews. We have a fantastic Thai restaurant in our hometown here in Tennessee, but we all agreed that Spice was much better. Again, we were able to sit at a table by the sidewalk, watching the city move. Totally worth it, and this was less expensive than Lasagna.

Are we experimented awkward silences? What about when there is nothing else to say in the middle of a conversation or we think we already finish it, or by mutual agreement we need to move on. Perhaps, the most interesting silences are the ones linked with social interaction, where human beings assume a social comprehension of others and their surroundings by senses such as the speech or the body language. Audience : Hearing is a sound installation that invites spectators to bring their own silences to the exhibition space. What follows is a variety of silences collected (a hundred of them) mixed-up with new participants during the event. It keeps proximity with 4’33” of John Cage, in spite of that, the angle offered is closer to real life situations than to a theatrical sound art piece.

It's too early in the New year for me to think about the usual goals for the year. I never attempt my getting fitter, maintaining/losing weight until the middle of the month. That gives time for the goodies to go and life to settle down. This year is extra slow as my eldest belle will be 18 on Wednesday!

Yes I realise that I have all the time in the world to eat out, or eat more normal, but, it’s making recovery seriously uncomfortable and utterly horrid. I can’t get out of my food fears at all in the day, but the night time, well anything goes (within reason, and so long as it’s in reach and can be covered in nut products). How do you trust the rope and put your foot over the ledge? Right this second, I know I want to jump head first into recovery and stop faffing about and delaying the inevitable (even though I know how utterly terrifying it is), but by the morning this mindset disappears.
I was an exceptionally awkward teenager. I typically had few, if any friends. I conversed more easily with adults twenty to thirty years my senior than I ever did with my compatriots. The only place I really felt like I belonged was on the football team, but even then, my tendency to read books in excess of 1,000 pages before, after, and sometimes during practice set me apart from my teammates. I rarely dated, though that trend continued even into my adulthood. I became used to being described as weird. And, while my experience was unique in its details, it is a completely normal experience for any teenager in America to feel like he or she doesn’t fit with the in crowd (even if you happen to be in the in crowd).

Besides AIDS, crime, drugs, poverty and environmental destruction, Haiti has a form of slavery called restavec. A Haitian Creole term meaning “stays with,” a restavec is a poor child sold to a wealthy family as a servant. The government itself accepts a U.N. estimate of 300,000 such children in Haiti. Jean-Robert Cadet, a former restavec who escaped to America wrote a book in 1999 called Restavec: From Haitian Slave Child to Middle Class American. He says restavecs “are treated worse than slaves because . . . their supply seems inexhaustible.” Mr. Cadet says restavecs are often beaten and raped. Despite prodding from the U.N., the European Union, and the Catholic Church, Haitian officials have done nothing to stop this practice.

Darn!! We just can’t seem to win can we? We must find a way to satisfy that sweet tooth! In my opinion, you are better off to use a small amount of honey or maple syrup, if you are looking for the occasional sweet thing. Or allow the dreaded white sugar very occasionally. The down side to frequent use of aspertame, xylitol, nutrasweet etc. far out weighs the effects of a bit of white death. Maybe think of it this way…if you like to sweeten your tea, coffee et al, use stevia or a touch of honey or maple syrup. I would hope you aren’t drinking 20 cups a day! One or 2 cups with a touch of honey per day, isn’t too bad. Or maybe learn to drink it without…lemon in your tea instead or something like that. Once a month have the dessert of your choice…pull out all the stops but only once a month! I’m not suggesting this to people that have known sugar handling issues.

Their two neighboring planets closer to the sun were not suitable for habitation within the Barsoomians' remaining timeframe, although they might be in the distant future despite their relatively heavy gravity (more than twice that of Barsoom), and the one closest to the sun would never be suitable; but the spaceflight breakthrough (Ironically, it was discovered by someone from the hauptschule-equivalent track.) allowed for FTL (faster than light) travel and that put other star systems within reach. Surely there would be Barsoom-like planets around other, nearby yellow dwarfs. Numerous small scoutships could be sent out to discover them and then, once those Barsoom-like planets were located, large colony ships could follow where the scouts led.

LA: I think the Queens Hall is going to be a special one. We managed to sell the Liquid Rooms out the last time we were in Edinburgh and that was a great show so I’m glad we can notch it up a bit. Me and Phil, the drummer, are both from Edinburgh so it’s kind of a hometown show for us. Even though people think of us as a Glasgow band but we’re all from other places. Kev is the only one from Glasgow, Phil and myself are from Edinburgh, Joe is from Dundee, Stu our live guitarist is from Penicuik and Sarah is from Northumberland. Edinburgh is kind of a half homecoming show I guess. The Queen’s Hall is a great venue, I’ve seen some great music in there and played there a couple of times with various different people. That’s the day the new album comes out as well, so it’s the first day on the tour we can sell the new record.

Neither "Islamic terrorists" nor illegal immigrants killed that little girl, a mentally disturbed American-born man with a gun did.

We all know how important good and likeable characters are to a story, but the revelation was that it’s not just the reader who needs them, it’s the writer. And without any passion for my character, it was getting kind of tedious writing about her. It’s like having one of those friends who is undoubtedly a really ‘nice’ person, but you end up making excuses as to why you can’t see them or why you have to cut the phone call short or would you believe it, “something has just come up and I’m going to
Those who left the West-End Brewery before 6pm missed out on a eye catching spread of food, including two large dinner large plates stacked high with fries and sausages, as well as an intimidating heap of buttered and thickly sliced white bread, which was all served with the best wishes of the pub landlord, who apologised for not getting down to catch the game. Next week we should have a photographer, so it will no longer be necessary to trawl through the club's extensive photographic archive in order to add some much needed colour to these match reports.

While it was just one game, the Jackson performance was an encouraging sign for the Tigers to see.

Later President Marcos of the Philippines was appointed and held the position of M1 until 1987 and then the position was transferred to Dr. Ray C. Dam, in October of 1987, under Legal Decadency to Heir RCD1087 Far East Entire with formal Power of Attorney and Assignment of Indonesian Assets signed by Sarinah Soetiwi (holder of the assets on behalf of the Nation of Indonesia as assigned by President Soekarno) in 1992, Dam’s authority later promulgated January 20, 1995. Dam proved to be impossible for the entire system to work with, (either because he refused to allow those who placed him in authority to steal, or because of his personal arrogance…. Difficult to know which is correct) and his authority over the Institutional parent registration Accounts set aside and the system reverted to the three Nations who had controlled these accounts since World war II, United States, Great Britain and France, who systematically and illegally subverted the established system since 1996.

Nuclear power plants come to my mind as spectacularly bad things to build. I heard that debris from the Fukushima tsunami disaster has drifted across the Pacific. Most of it sank to the bottom of the ocean. But quite a lot of debris is now making its way to our shorelines here on the West Coast. There is concern I guess that drums of toxic waste might land here and release their contents as they pound against rocks in the surf.
Duke Baysee, on the other hand, is a bizarre case to say the least. For some years, he was actually my late night conductor on the number 38 bus through London, reeling off tickets and taking fares from the often drunken public. While most conductors bore the slurring sideswipes of many an aggressive half-cut human with brave faces, Baysee took matters one stage further. He would dance, skip and shimmy around the vehicle, whilst occasionally singing or honking and wailing blues riffs on his harmonica. With a co-ordination I envied, he used to race up and down the stairs in a manner which would have seen me falling flat on my face (especially after a few beers) singing whatever song took his fancy. His attitude usually brought enormous cheer to a route which wasn't a trouble-free one to say the least, trawling as it did through some of the roughest areas of London. Whilst he later claimed to start singing and prancing around on the job as a way of "pissing miserable passengers off", it did seem to actually diffuse situations - I observed his fellow conductors in the same area getting far more abuse than he was ever on the receiving end of. His off-the-wall personality saw him through.

It seems that Henry Wolf, from San Francisco, (no relation to Wolf Blitzer or Nero Wolfe) has engaged the services of an attorney because he says that his “BMW” motorcycle gave him an erection that lasted two years. Which I can see his logic when it comes to hiring an attorney. After all, mounting a motorcycle isn’t something you’d care to do all the time with an erection considering you’d rather be mounting other things where a two-year erection does come in handy.

As I dig my hand into the railing and look down at the ridges before me, I hesitate, then gingerly place toes, then the rest of my feet on the escalator floor. I expect the floor to change to steps, like those at the main Eaton’s store, but it remains a series of slabs rudely jutting out. Riding up makes me feel as if I’m on a conveyor belt in a factory assembly line; riding down is akin to standing on the poor person’s roller coaster without the safety bar across your front.

Gotye (ft. Kimbra) performs “Somebody That I Used to Know”
The opening Intro (The Arrival Of The Mother) marks the arrival and the central point for the tale to wrap around. The following first full track It Began On Mars soon adds to its weave of electronic sounds an intimidating muscular pulse to begin a scourge on the ear. The track is a flurry of samples, twisting sounds, and switching rhythms and pace to keep one constantly intrigued and involved. Within the song itself there is an open diversity which is soon apparent across the release itself, again to ensure nothing is ever expected or presumed.

The first half of the Lord’s Prayer explores what it means to love God through prayer. God is addressed as “our Father”, not simply a god we wish to do business with.

When you love someone, you begin to desire what they desire.

There is already plenty of evidence that evangelicalism today is not a unified movement and we have to speak of a spectrum of evangelical opinion, covering a range of views and having very fuzzy edges. No one, then is talking about the future of an already stable movement. Quite the opposite. A paper to be presented at the National Assembly of Evangelicals in November 1996 expresses concern that contemporary attitudes to Statements of Faith are either to use them as flags of convenience which are not enforced too seriously, or to exploit them by an appeal to hermeneutics which justifies different, yet contrasting interpretations and mental reservations.
Some websites and organizations are marking the day with giveaways. For example, Rancho Obi-Wan is giving away memberships! All you have to do is sign up to be on their mailing list (on the right side of the page) to get a chance to win one of four memberships. And trust me, a membership to this place is a big deal. In fact, purchasing a membership or giving it as a gift to someone else would be one heck of a way to commemorate Star Wars day.

I have lived in my neighborhood for 10 years (8 of those with no dog) and in the 2 years since I adopted Remi I have met and befriended people I was too “busy” to meet pre-dog (more people know my dog more than they know me!) and I have learned that instead of always rushing to a destination I can simply stroll around the city and enjoy the journey.

One event that has always been firmly stored in my memory is the story of my first babysitter whom my mom simply called Hermana Sylvia. In Latin countries people usually precede someone’s name with either “Hermano” or “Hermana”, especially if they’ve first interacted or met via a church service. This then tends to carry over into regular day to day communication and interaction as well. (It simply means Brother or Sister).

It’s interesting that McWhorter notes the passionate letters of Civil War soldiers. He praises texts and e-mails for giving us a language to express the informal, but fails to see just why those letters are so marvelous. Those letters, and letters in general, demonstrate reflection. They are wonderful precisely because they are not written approximations of daily speech. They clarify rather than obfuscate. The writers of these letters avoided ambiguity in favor of raw, honest emotion.

In his gripping story of revenge in “The Cask of Amontillado” (1846), Montressor, the storyteller, used a prized wine (Amontillado) to lure his object of revenge, the unsuspecting Fortunato, a wine connoisseur, into the wine vaults where Montressor ruthlessly executed his plan by chaining his drunk enemy to the wall of a small recess in the crypt then, tier after tier, closed it with a wall of stone and mortar as the intoxicated and confused Fortunato still waited to try the Amontillado. A morbid thought but, while the setting of the story was somewhere else in Europe, the damp air and the old brick walls made it easy for my fertile mind to imagine a Fortunato walled in somewhere in the dark portions of these cellars.
We talked about traveling, and music, and squirrels;

Women Sufi poets were part of a widespread emancipation movement in the Indian Subcontinent and West Asia that started more than a thousand years ago and lasted till the nineteenth century. Interestingly, these poets fought for women’s rights at a time when that concept was still unformulated. This movement saw the emergence of women saints on an unprecedented scale, and was one of the most significant characteristics of the medieval age in West Asia and Southasia. Mystic women poets subverted conventional notions of gendered behaviour, helping women to defy stereotypes and break the chains of tradition and orthodoxy, which sought to control their sexuality. In the spiritual sphere of Sufism, physical distinction between male and female was often completely overlooked and the two were fused and identified. Many of the saints believed that all creation, being the product of the supreme creative power, was feminine.

Have you found yourself seeking to escape the stress, noise and pollution of your everyday environment, if only for a few minutes? Places that are available to escape to are becoming harder to find as the world’s population continues to increase; combined with the fact that more than 50% of the world’s population now lives in an urban environment.
Then I found Feynman. He put into a few words what I felt. He described a continuing discussion he had with artists, about beauty and the relationship of science to the appreciation of it. He recorded an interview for the BBC in which he reiterated much of the story, with the added advantage of his wry delivery.

The boy has stuffed his scoop into the slanted tube to catch the pellets sliding down the tube. As he watches the pellets race down the tube into his scoop, he can't help but let out a "woh" and "woh-oh". It turns into a screech when he removes the scoop and pellets come flooding out of the bottom of the tube. Here, it is interesting to note the role of the observer in this play. The girl on his right adds to the excitement with her screech, too. She has been watching the whole time and has picked up on the boy's excitement. Sometimes we overlook the role of the observer when we analyze children's play. An activity shared is more exciting and joyous.
Stay tuned for future duck happenings.
Of course, I had never really thought that besides serving as a subject to photograph, it might serve other purposes for other people; like the skater kids we found hanging outside, or the homeless man we did not see, but could definitely smell in one of the rooms. The air was thick as well, with the scent of decaying wood and garbage. Still, the inside was as amazing as I had imagined when I was a kid. Old surgery rooms still held signs of where instruments where to be kept, the skeleton of the elevator shafts impressed on each of the floors we visited.
Basically the results of the scientific data were fairly clear up until 1980: Aspartame was a dangerous, brain-tumor-causing man-made poison and the company trying to get it into the food supply was recommended for prosecution by the FDA. You would think that would be the end of aspartame, right?
I just came across this recipe for Peanut Butter Cup Blondies in this month's Cooking Light magazine. They had an entire section of brownies and they all looked SO good.

Ten is an exceptional movie, its formal rigor and simplicity providing a perfect framework for Kiarostami's probing study of the lives of Iranian women. These layered, rewarding dialogues subtly deal with issues of religion, domesticity, relationships between men and women, motherhood, and sex. But though there's an obvious current of social criticism running through the film, it's all couched in daily routines, friendships and relationships, with a deceptively casual dialogue style in which the subtext of social inquiry is deftly interwoven with warm humor and some intense emotional content.

Boots: Rain -Puppy-Purple-Boots – Nous Vuous -(Kawaii Fair Item)
We've had lots of adventures together over the years, but tonight one of my favorites will be revisited. In the summer of 1999, between our junior and senior years of college, I was already living in our rented apartment for the following school year. Julie had just gotten back from Israel, and we made plans to spend the Fourth of July together. Well, we at least agreed we were getting together, but the "plans" portion was undefined - very unusual for us. Somehow, we started the day at a Christmas Tree Shop (not really for purchasing Christmas trees, for those of you not familiar). We bought fancy plastic cups and a hammock, which we promptly installed in our living room. Because what college living room is complete without a hammock in it?
Though some of us White troglodytes had grave reservations, for most South Africans the freeing of Mandela was an intensely exciting, long-sought historic event. Measured against the gigantic global furore, the exultation created almost equated with the Second Coming, with Mandela himself about to descend from the Pearly Gates like some unscheduled fourth member of the Holy Trinity. For a while, SA was a nation delirious with joy and relief. Arising from his many and earlier private discussions with De Klerk and other Nat cabinet ministers, it was predicted that Mandela would be a decisive force in promoting reconciliation and constructive dialogue. Then, as now, he was universally delineated as a man of peace.

Watch either of those clips and tell me you wouldn't have convicted if you were on the jury. Then ask yourself if the evidence would have been quite so compelling if it were merely a verbal duel between barristers, coupled with testimony which would have come down to a simple 'do I believe the accused or the prosecution?'. Their word against the other's.
“Emotion is the power that attracts. That which you fear strongly, you will experience. Emotion is energy in motion. When you move energy, you create effect. If you move enough energy, you create matter. Matter is energy conglomerated. Moved around. Shoved together. If you manipulate energy long enough in a certain way, you get matter. Every Master understands this law. It is the alchemy of the universe. It is the secret of all life.” CWG Book 1

I never found anything terribly interesting in my own collection of coins. Pennies are inarguably of low value. However, my family had been in possession of a few coins of historical value. My mom had a few buffalo nickels from their first minting. They were badly worn. Also, my parents had purchased collections of US coins minted in the birth years of my brothers and my own. I still have that collection. It is pretty neat. Also, I have a few silver dollars, a number of half dollars, and a variety of newer US dollar coins.
It didn't take to long before it all came together.
After my work out I went to the little mall for a bit and saw something scary. A little girl got her shoe string caught in the escalator. She was about 7 years old and her shoe was untied and when she got to the end of the escalator, her string just went into one of the slats and she was stuck. She stood there, confused and inefectually yanking her leg like she was a bear in a bear trap, but her mom was really cool, just bent over and reversed it out, no fuss no muss. The little girl howled and hollered afterward and her mom was like "What is your deal? Jeez, calm down! That was no problem!" I thought the mom handled it well, all told. Norwegian moms are really laid back, I like the way they tend to handle their kids.

The district court correctly recognized that the addition of the term "length" did not narrow the scope of the claim because every physical object has a length. The district court also determined that adding the limitation that the plate be "differentially spaced" above the membrane did narrow the scope of the claim, and the court assumed that the reason for the amendment was a substantial one relating to patentability. We agree with the district court, however, that the territory surrendered by the "differentially spaced" amendment comprises plates that are not differentially spaced above the membrane. That conclusion is consistent with the prosecution history. The patentee added the "differentially spaced" limitation to distinguish the diaphragm mouth call from a prior art device that consisted of a shelf-like structure positioned on top of the membrane without any spacing. The accused device, however, includes a dome that is spaced above the membrane. Because the accused device’s dome includes the spacing, the amendment was merely tangential to the contested element in the accused device, and thus prosecution history estoppel does not apply to prevent the application of the doctrine of equivalents.

I find writing to be invigorating. When the words fall into place just the right way, when that one line pops into my head and I think "this is it," when the character does something that I never would have thought of, when I push past a period of blankness, I get a good feeling and I start to think that maybe being a writer isn't such a bad job. That being said, the real reason I am a writer is because of the people. But, how can this be, you might be asking yourself. Aren't writers typically introverts, immersing themselves in their work and leaving the "real" world behind? In a way, yes. However, there are a few things you should know.

But are these the true problems? Or are they just the superficial symptoms? There must be something deeper going on that is causing all of these negative symptoms in our marriage and relationships. What is the ROOT of all these symptoms? I believe the ROOT of all these problems is a lack of or a misguided spiritual motivation.

What's really behind the complaints of the commercialization of Christmas has something to do with the psychology of a Judas, I think. Not Judas insofar as he was a betrayer, but insofar as he objected to expensive perfume being used to anoint Christ (John 12:4-6). Judas's pride prevented him from sharing in the mystery of Christ's redemptive act as did Mary. What follows is envy and the will to destroy the good of another. So he objects that the oil could better have been used for the poor. Similarly, some see the joy of Christmas expressed in others and are unable or unwilling to share it themselves. So they must find a reason to poison the fruit, and the method at hand is the condemnation of Christmas as too commercial.

Perhaps an analogy can be drawn to modern politics, where taking a particular political position can align you with a friendly party, but make you the target of another. It is possible that someone might align themselves with a particular candidate and create a tension with old friends who find that candidate offensive.

So he brings in the relief pitcher, and with this new, refreshed pitcher, the promise of the chance to win the game.
This is one of the reasons at the start of this year I suggested the publishing industry needs to seriously consider a publishing model which does not pay advances - certainly not on works of fiction. There is a case for an advance on the costs of research and resources for an author writing a book of non-fiction. Independent publishers have long worked out that they cannot compete on every level with large publishers and consequently examined their models of business and development strategy far closer. What this means is independent publishers are quicker to embrace digital print and ebook advances, revise contract agreements and offer authors better royalty percentages and more involvement in the promotion and marketing of a book.

I’m glad to say that the circus I worked for never went in for fortune tellers. The modern circus is for athletes and comedians, not crafty soothsayers who bamboozle the gullible with tarot cards and other such nonsense. We once had a problem with one of these characters, an old gypsy woman who lived a short distance from our venue. It all started when a clown fell ill after an encounter with this woman. The doctor said there was nothing physically wrong with him and suggested the cause might be psychological. When I went to see the clown, he moaned that he was doomed because the old woman had put a curse on him. I told him not to talk rot and snap out of it, but he persisted in his morbid superstition. As the fellow played an important part in my act, getting huge laughs when I dragged him along the ground, I resolved to visit the old woman in the hope of working out a reasonable solution.
As for the humour, well… I’m reluctant to make any pronouncements, since there is always an awkward cultural barrier separating French and English wit, no matter what your level of fluency. But some of Aurélie’s exaggerations and neuroses did make me break into a cynical Anglo smirk. Here’s an example:
Then there’s the economy…Dooks has promised blue skies at every turn, yet the economy is in a recession….0 per cent growth in the last 3 years is nothing to scoff or sniff at!

Sequels are hard work. You fight with how much backstory you need to go into in every book to satisfy new readers, you worry about checking details against earlier works, you wring your hands in worry when the main story arc starts to go off in a different direction. If I was more organised, I would plan. I would write a plan for each book and stick to it. But where would be the fun in that, eh?
But, well, that statement could probably apply to nearly anything.
Similarly, Jim Balent turns in some great pencils. His redesign of Catwoman's costume (which I think is the fourth or fifth one that did during his years drawing the character) is excellent and in keeping with the look of the rest of the "re-envisioned" Gotham City. The costume of the evil Bat-man is also a great and appropriately, insanely horrific. On the downside, Balent was well into his "breasts must be at least the size of the woman's head" phase. (But it's not as bad as his work on his self-published "Tarot" series... where breasts are at least TWICE the size of the head.)

In an article by the Mirror (January 16th), it was revealed that one in 20 cat owners would shut their kitty outdoors all day if it had excess pounds to lose. Of course, this isn't something that would necessarily be welcomed by, or safe for our cats, either. Getting plenty of daily exercise is important for your cats but they need to have the opportunity to rest when they want. If you are concerned about your pussy's weight, seek the advice of your vet or a pet specialist, who can offer you guidance on the recommended calorie intake of you pet and tips to keep him/her fit and purring.
Oh that and....that my husband was on a medication that caused some fertility "issues" as well. Then his ignorant Doctor had the audacity to argue that the drug would help that area of our our lives. Needless to say we are no longer patients of hers. She's a dud. Not a dude, a dud. This isn't her first time of misdiagnosing issues either. She diagnosed Eric with a pulled groin muscle when he actually had a pretty large inguinal hernia. Yeah nice, right? This misdiagnosis cost us close to a thousand dollars out of our pockets and took about 8 months to get the real diagnosis. He's since had surgery to fix it. Because I'm not in the very best mood right now I have the urge to say who this "doctor" is. But I know it's wrong of me to feel that way, and would be even more wrong (wronger?) to do it. So, I won't.

In terms of hard information, the speech sets out Eamon’s understanding that, following confirmation via a question in the Dail, that Ireland’s ratification of the ESM treaty – that’s the one which makes access to cheap and certain EU funding of future bailouts dependent on signing up to the Fiscal Compact – will take place AFTER the forthcoming referendum on 31st May 2012, Eamon says it is his understanding – and puts the “in my understanding” in bold letters – that the ESM treaty needs be ratified unanimously in the 27 EU member states and that the Fiscal Compact cannot be actualised until the ESM treaty is ratified in the Dail. Here’s where this gets convoluted but bear with this a second – if Ireland votes “no” in the 31st May referendum then if the Dail does not subsequently ratify the (new) ESM treaty, then the ESM cannot be introduced across the EU. The simpler point is that Eamon says that unless we get some debt relief and there are other reforms in Europe, then we can vote “no” now which will stymie the ESM in the rest of Europe, and presumably Europe will then move to address Irish concerns and there can then be a second referendum.
Also of note is Swope Park. It is the liberty kansas genealogy in MLB since 1880. He went on to play a large part of the liberty kansas genealogy to consider. Other things to do for every taste and interest. For instance, Kansas produces the most important national parks and boulevards. They are among the liberty kansas genealogy and will also increase their achievement. They will not be aware of is the liberty kansas genealogy. The Kansas International Airport is also home to more than 6 thousand ghost towns in Kansas.

Through my love of U2, I connected with fans throughout the world, many of whom shared my fascination with Africa and were activists in their local communities to raise awareness of initiatives such as the African Well Fund, the One Campaign, and many others. In my very early years of my Africa obsession, I had been passionate about the animals, landscape, conservation and the physical geography of the continent. But it changed very quickly into a passion for the people and sparked a desire to understand politics and international relations/development.
To be honest I’ve done something similar before. I tend to get obsessed with finding TV writers to follow on Twitter, so I’ll look at a cast & crew list on IMDB and search for names. (That’s not creepy, is it?) But as it turns out finding email addresses is not the same as a Twitter handle.
Unfortunately, thanks to Ehud Barack and Tzipi Livni's bending to pressure from US Secretary of State Condi Rice and the UN, a premature ceasefire was enacted that saved Hezbollah from destruction and allowed them to regroup, rearm and consolidate their control over Lebanon.

The episode begins right where it left off. Thor requests SG-1’s help against the Replicators because, well…blew it. Again. While the Asgard could not repair Reese, their creator, they were able to create a recall signal for every Replicator to converge on an abandoned Asgard planet called Hala. This revelation makes Thor’s statement the Replicators have overrun the Asgard home world a wee bit misleading, but all right. The Asgard used a device left on the planet to dramatically slow the passage of time once the Replicators were all present and accounted. For the Replicators, time would virtually stand still while it passed normally for everyone else. The Asgard could have centuries to devise a plan to ultimately stop them.

I know this is a long gone pending post but with so much at hand, I kept procrastinating. And now that I’ve fallen ill and homebound, I thought I’d use the time to finish up some posts.

We are indebted to the Mahāvamsa of the sixth century CE for this tale.

God has a plan for your life and you will not die until that plan is fulfilled. Jesus Christ’s earthly work was completed as He said from the cross, “It is finished.” Paul’s work was not done until he wrote in 2 Timothy 4:6, “For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.”
It's sort of nice to be reading more of my own books, rather than feeling pressured to complete library books so I can return them on time. Okay, I admit that I picked up a handful of children's books from the library yesterday. When I wrote about Barbara Cooney on Wednesday, I found that she considered three of her children's books to be as near as she would ever come to an autobiography. So I checked out those three books, which you'll read about on Wednesday in my next library loot post.
I often think that it is precisely this thinking that has gotten me into trouble... actually it has been the cause of many a broken heart.... (actually hearts can't break, the most that happens is they tear, then eventually are mended.)

This brings up a problem though. With a specific scene which I dislike so much, and a director I dislike so much.. How come I enjoyed the movie so much? So far this year, I've seen two films, both from Disney, both capable of transporting me to nearly euphoric plateaus of fun. The first, John Carter, had me quite nearly cheering at the screen. It was such a good movie, and in my opinion faithful adaption of the spirit of the source material, that I couldn't wait to see it again and nearly bought another ticket that same night. Avengers I've seen twice already inside of it's first week!. The only other movie I've ever done that for was "Fellowship of the Ring".

On the BBC's “Question Time” last night, the idiocy of that fetishisation of the bits of paper was highlighted by a statement from the doltish David Starkey. In supporting the Liberal-Tories policy of Cuts, he pointed with glee to what he said was an historical parallel in the actions of the Canadian Government. They took their cuts to the extent, he relished, of blowing up schools and hospitals. Even a former City worker in the audience, whilst not pointing out just how ridiculous such an action shows Capitalism to be, did point out that even at a superficial level the resource based Canadian economy is in no way comparable to that of the UK. And, in fact, part of the reason the problem in Ireland is resurfacing is precisely because of the fact that the Cuts it has implemented, have sent its economy back into recession, making repayment of debt even harder. Ireland, along with the other PIIG economies has seen the prices of its Bonds fall steadily over recent months to a level now where it is paying higher rates of interest on them than it was in May! The recent downgrading of Spain's Bonds shows that they will soon be following Ireland.

A couple of people suggested the SMON and PX slaves could read the log file on database startup – but as another poster pointed out, it’s the startup process that reads the log files – and if parallel recovery is invoked it passes change vectors to the PX slaves, the slaves don’t read the log files directly. Apart from that, I don’t really know which processes read the log file – I don’t want to say “process X doesn’t” read the log file, because it may do at times that I haven’t considered. (And there are lots of processes to look into in 11g.)

He was so good the entire trip! We got to the Canadian/Ontario border around midnight and there was quite a line-up because only two lanes were open. The person in front of us took so long with the customs agent and then was directed to secondary search with sirens and lights blaring. Robert and I looked at each other and thought that this was perhaps not a good sign! The customs agent took one look at Ash and exclaimed what a cute cat he was.
It depends on what else is going on. If I’m trying to meet a deadline I’ll hunker down and work on that specific piece. If I’m just trying to finish a manuscript I’ll try to get in a thousand words or more a day. If I’ve got other projects and work going on then I just have to take it as it comes. I’m always happier when I’m writing, though, so I try to carve time out for it every day.
Now, to be fair, none of my relationships have exactly lasted. Dating I am great at, actual relationships, admittedly, not so much ( I believe Morgan Spurlock proved that McDonald French Fries outlast my boyfriends in terms of a shelf life) but I have, in the past, found people with whom I wanted to share more than a handful of outings. And so far, in this project, either I haven't found them or they haven't (metaphysically) found me or, perhaps more fittingly, we collectively didn't find our connection.

As bad as the comments section on Brookhouse’s article became, it had nothing on the comments for Maggie Hendricks’ piece. This isn’t the first time the MMA community has turned deplorable on Hendricks’ articles, most notably when Joe Rogan referred to her as “cunty” and the community took up for their hero to blast her repeatedly. Now, I’m no Rogan basher. In fact, I’m a big fan. The Joe Rogan Experience, The Bugle and Sklarbro Country are the only podcasts I listen to every episode of. But tearing into a woman with the most disgusting hate speech imaginable for rightly pointing out that there is a distinction between Rogan speaking as a comic (on stage) and Rogan as a UFC representative (on the Underground) is a sign of a deeper problem. With the story on Forrest, another fan favorite, the hate came out full force again.

We also read some non-fiction picture books about the beach and other sea creatures. After reading and talking about all of the things we could see at the beach, my kiddos created their own ocean scenes. I gave them light blue construction paper and they made an underwater ocean scene - some included the beach and wrote about "What I see at the sea..." A great way to sneak in a little homophone review. But guess what? I didn't get any snapshots of their pictures or their writing. I did however, manage to snap some pictures of us reading on the beach... well, at least we tried to pretend. There wasn't much sand between our toes, but we definitely soaked in some sun!

Today, not so far from the shore, I saw a fisherman in a wet suit casting his line from a point in the surf where the waves were breaking just below his chest. I stood there watching him, the sunshine fading slowing over the western hills in Newport, both of us bathed in amber-yellow light. To me, he was living perfectly, dwelling in the energy of the crashing surf; while I was living passively, watching safely from a position just steps away from where the ebbing tide recedes.

During my 9 day vacation in Rome it was day 3 when I was finally fed up waiting for traffic to stop for me at zebra crossings and so with no Italians in sight to follow I decided that I would be assertive and cool and just like the Romans I would start walking across the street and not wait by the sidewalk, I even turned to my husband said “you know what? I’m just going to walk, I’m walking… I’m walking… I’m not going to stop” As the cars approached my husband hurried across (what not to do no.2) and I caught myself acting like a deer struck by the bright headlights of a car in the middle of the street, not knowing if I should run backwards or forwards, went forwards turned and went backwards then turned and ran forwards again (what not to do no.1), by then my husband was standing on the other side of the street looking at me with a huge grin on his face.
I was talking to one of my staff members about the new job and I could see she was visibly upset. I asked her what was wrong and she simply said " I can see that you don't know my story." She asked to speak to me privately and then told me something so horrific, I don't know how she manages to get up out of bed every day. She told me that she had lost her oldest child in a fire a few years back and that the anniversary of the death was coming up. With the trauma of facing that awful date combined with the knowledge that her boss was leaving and the troublemakers were dancing with joy at the prospect of slipping back into their old ways again, she was finding it hard to cope.

Continuing our commuter chat, I said to wifesy, “You know, wouldn’t it be great if much like getting the right breed of dog for your family, you could get the right breed of kid?” For example, you have a bookish kid born into a family that likes to play football and spends their weekends enjoying motocross sports. The bookish kid is constantly frowning, reading, wearing black, and listening to Morissey. Then Cesar steps in and says, “No, this is the wrong breed of kid for your family.” He takes the bookish child and drops him off with a couple in upstate New York. In Ithaca, specifically, the town that houses Cornell University. His new parents are college professors. They spend each evening quizzing each other and Sundays languishing over every major national newspaper while sipping coffee and making homemade waffles. Bookish kid is beside himself with happiness and if he had a tail, you’d be sure to see him wagging it.

Hey good news everybody, I’m having a way better Wednesday than I did last week. Not a whole lot has been going on; Friday night/Saturday my mom and Becky came to visit after a college visit to Rolla. We ate Chinese food for dinner, went to my favorite coffee house for Oreo Quicksands, shopped at Charming Charlies, looked for a prom dress for Becky, ate at an Italian restaurant, and went to The Cup. I may just be 10 pounds heavier now but I’m gonna go out on a limb and say it was worth it.

Then I became involved in community work and studied the ‘business’ management side of charitable and community organisations. I set-up a community group and Paintball team, which I managed and raised funds for, and working with local youth groups engaged the community, taking the youth groups on paintball trips.

Eventually costs prevented the team continuing and my studies, for what was now intended to be a BSc Honors in Health Studies as an entry route to Medical School, consumed most of my time…

This brings me to the fact that the film is based on a true story. In the closing credits, the film-maker Sean Penn thanks the real family for their cooperation in the making of the film and goes even further to acknowledge their bravery in doing so. No doubt. The parents of the protagonist are portrayed in a very unsympathetic light, their transformative anguish notwithstanding. So I agree that it took courage for them to endorse the film, (same for the book that inspired it, I suppose). At the same time, their son is presented as a Christ who redeems them of their sins, who ultimately forgives them for their transgressions against everyone, especially himself. I can accept this as far as it goes; that is, as it pertains to the particular psycho-dynamics of their family. I can even get with this to some extent as it expands to address the class standing and bourgeois values of his family that he casts off like Siddartha, which is to say I admire the Romantic critique of capitalism as far as it goes. But at bedrock, ITW is just too reverential of the protagonist and him being based on the tragic real life of Christopher McCandless is an excuse that also only goes so far. On this score, Wikipedia tell me that a documentary has been made about McCandless and the Denver Film Society tells me that documentarian Ron "Lamothe asks us to consider whether the facts of McCandless' life are as compelling as the opportunity they provide for subverting, as much as celebrating, the romantic paradigm he has come to embody."

Let’s revisit for a moment: Tradition holds that women should be encouraged to attend the mosque, but for women who have responsibilities in the home, they’ll get the same reward when they pray at home. Not everyone has responsibilities. Some have maids. Some share responsibilities with their husbands. Some don’t have families. Some are converts looking for support. Some are students looking for Islamic education. Some are female scholars looking to educate other women. Some are looking for charity. Some are abused women looking for community support. None of them will get what they need from the mosque if as a global community we truly believe that the “best” place for a woman is to pray in her home.

When I got to Arizona, I did great. Maybe that was because I was too exhausted to eat copious amounts of food, or maybe it's because my sister refuses to have anything with any sort of fat content in her house. Either way, I knew I was golden. Then, the next morning I had donuts. Whoops. After that I did pretty well... again I thing it was more due to the lack of unhealthy food than the me.

Decision #3: Stop letting Cheyenne read stupid books. I have never let Cheyenne read books that were out-right profane or inappropriate for a child, but I have fallen into the habit of letting her pick out her own library books. However, when Evan and I realized that 90% of the books she picked last time were Goosebumps (kid horror), Sponge Bob Squarepants (from a TV show), Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Captain Underpants, we got thinking. We don't let our kids watch television because it is full of stupidity, why let her gorge on a diet of books filled with stupidity? I've really been conflicted about her reading the Wimpy Kid series for a while now. It didn't sound bad at first (wimpy kid writes a diary about his life), but when I read some over her shoulder, I couldn't stand the main character. He is self-centered, mean in a passive way, and utterly unredeemed by nice qualities, as far as I could see. So I bagged up all the books in the aforementioned series to take back to the library, which Cheyenne found out this morning as she was browsing for a book to read at breakfast. This decision was definitely NOT a popular one. There was much stomping around, ameliorated only by one popular decision, to let her wear the high-heeled sandals Aunt Bet had bought for her at the thrift store to school today.

The girls and I had fun making and playing with homemade Moon Sand last week. We made moon sand with O(5) when she was younger (probably 2), and it was really messy. This time we used a different recipe, and I liked it better. Here is the link to the blog where this idea originated. To make moon sand you need 4 cups of sand, 2 cups of corn meal (the recipe says corn flour, but we used corn meal...evidently I was supposed to use corn starch. However, it worked out fine with the corn meal, and I like it better since we used cornstarch last time, and it was terribly messy. I'm not sure how long it will last...I'll let you know), and 1 cup of water. We ended up tripling the recipe and adding a little bit of extra water.
So should we be placated by the presence of the CAG on site at NAMA? Would you be put at ease knowing that the CAG might be examining the Corksale reported today to ensure that the taxpayer’s interests were protected? Sticking an auditor’s hat on, I can’t see how the CAG could effectively oversee NAMA’s disposals unless the auditor had access to expertise on standard practice in the asset management business. Otherwise how would they even know what questions to ask? Auditors typically have standards – written down rules and procedures – against which they check the reality of operations in a company.

So you get all these stories together and you make a radio piece out of it. A month or two later, it's broadcast during rush hour, on a Friday night, as you want to give people something to think about over the weekend.
G. can't stand the show, but how sweet of him to get me these to celebrate the finale I had been looking forward to! I was so touched I cried...and then I cried during the episode, too. Love it!

Researchers studied the dietary habits via questionnaires of over 50,000 registered nurses aged 45 years and over for a period of eight years and found that those who reported consuming the most vitamin A and carotenoids were found to have a lower risk of developing cataracts.
6. Heart necklace with different coloured stones (Christmas Gift 2007)
On their new record Cynic’s New Year, the formula remains intact, and it came at a time where I was in the market for something bittersweet and infused with light. So far, “Nearly Old Friends” has kept me coming back. As a band, Horse Feathers don’t really get wild in any capacity, but prefer to rely on gentleness that ebbs and flows with moments heightened tension. While Ringle’s lyrics are often hard to distinguish, the emotional tone is rarely rooted in lyrical content. It’s a product of his delivery. But there are a couple lines in in “Nearly Old Friends” that stick out clearly, and the wonky phrasing of a common phrase tickled the dorky English major in me, “with a dirty tongue / something wicked is bound to this way come / then we’ll see / if we both have to crawl from the bottom.” Like most of their songs, I don’t like them for what they mean, but for how they make me feel. This song is no exception. Here they capture how complex relationships on any level can ultimately be, while giving credit to our inherent need to see them out for better or for worse where emotions are concerned. Horse Feathers are a band that I feel blessed to have in my life, one that I know I can rely on to get me through those periods where breaking through to the other side seems insurmountable. I’d recommend them to anyone.

That spurred me on. Now it was time to see what the professionals thought. I sent it to the Hilary Johnson Authors’ Advisory Service. This was the first service I paid for because I figured it was important to know if the story was as good as it appeared to be and also, to get professional feedback before I spent any more time and money on it. The first line in the report read…
Since I know you're all reading the tracklist, I want to immediately step in to head off any further sourcing questions. First, no, we don't have the Birmingham recording of Twenty Four Hours in any other source than the original vinyl. Second, These Days is the only track we have - that is usable in any fashion - from the previously-unknown soundboard recording. Third, we do not have any idea if other soundboard tracks exist anywhere for the Moonlight gig from which Sister Ray was taken.

Look, I make no apologies for the fact that I’m old enough to recall when Kennedy and Kruschev were engaged in a nasty game of chicken just off the shores of Cuba; when Timothy Leary was telling kids to turn on, tune in, drop out; and when the entire family would gather around the tube on Sunday night to watch Ed Sullivan get all warm and fuzzy with a faux mouse name Topo Gigo.

We are so used to working in pencil that we often don’t stop to think about how wonderful and versatile a tool it really is. Pencil marks are easily erasable, which gives us the freedom to make mistakes over and over and correct them as many times as we need. Pencils can be sharpened to a fine point – great for detail – and they can also go blunt, which is ideal for shading.
These are toxins produced by blue-green algae, which cause liver damage and can be fatal. No serious study has been done on this problem since the mid-1980s.
After paying the fee and filing the request, which was about “memoranda and reports regarding (1) Mohamad Harkat and (2) the ‘bin Laden network’ prepared in 2001 and 2002”, I first received a call and then an email asking for clarification on what was meant by the term ‘bin Laden network”. The funny part about this was that the term was one that was developed and taken straight from CSIS documents, and thus they most likely knew was meant by it. The letter also indicated that my request was in abeyance until I clarified and if I did not clarify by a certain date, my request would be abandoned. I sent out an email clarifying what was meant well before the specified date and have not heard back since. This leads me to speculate about the possible outcome of my request, and whether I will receive the information I requested or whether the information with be denied or withheld like many of my classmates have experienced.

Because of the higher maximum clock rate, DDR4 memories may permit a pin-count reduction for some SoC designs. How? At double the clock rate, SoC designs can get the same data bandwidth with 16 data bits clocked at 1600MHz (3.2 Gtransfers/sec) as DDR3 designs get with an 800MHz clock rate. However, there’s a design caveat or two. First, SPB (silicon, package, board) design for DDR4-3200 SDRAM is going to be considerably harder than for DDR3-1600 SDRAM. In addition, most memory experts predict that designs with multiple DDR4 DIMMs on each memory channel will not be able to work reliably (or at all) starting with data transfer rate considerably below the 3.2 Gtransfers/sec maximum. Similarly, DIMMs with multiple memory ranks on the board may also fail before the data transfer rate reaches 3.2 Gtransfers/sec.

Instead of turning to the Scriptures for guidance, many young Christians are turning to the world to shape their thinking. Placed up against science, the Bible is seen as inferior. Measured up against other religions, Christianity is considered to be intolerant. Compared to popular opinion, spirituality is portrayed as ignorance. This is what the Church is up against when faced with defining their faith for the future.

STEWART: I think there is a belt and suspenders quality to the statute, no matter how you parse it, but I think that Microsoft has essentially the same problem, because they have constructed a theory under which the second sentence does something that the first has not, does not, but they haven't constructed any theory as to why the first sentence is not superfluous. That is, given the second sentence to the effect that the burden of establishing invalidity is on the challenger, there's no more work to be done by the first sentence.

These required returns are forbiddingly high for any borrower who would invest the cash flow savings by acquiring financial assets. There is no way a borrower can earn such returns without taking very large risks. Most borrowers probably fall into this category.

While we cope with this, the increasing housing shortage grows worse. Rents have skyrocketed - why charge $400 a week when you can get $150 a night for short term people - who are desperate for somewhere while their homes are repaired. EQC insist that homes are completely emptied, including curtains, while the work is done, which makes sense for major work like repiling, new walls and floors, but is probably not essential for paint and plastering! So pets are boarded, storage is sought and people do get out, into these rental places or temproary homes or caravans or relatives, mainly using the insurance payouts to pay for it all. Meanwhile, people renting in the areas whose houses have been condemned in the suburban red zones, are finding they will soon have no where to live - or anywhere they can afford to rent.

After passing up those gummi bears for more than 100 days, but in a moment of profound weakness, I succumbed to the pressure of those colorful, little, morsels of joy! I asked the front office person whom the 5 lb bags are entrusted (to keep the jar filled) if she knew how many calories were in a gummi bear. She pulled open a drawer, lifted a plastic bag and read, “120 calories per serving, and each serving has 12 gummi bears.” My math skills being as sharp as they are, I chimed in quickly with, “that’s only 10 calories per bear!” She agreed.

A dark ruby colour awaits you and on the nose it gave off a significant blackcurrant and a slight hint of vanilla, followed with a taste that emphasised both flavours just right. It gives a soft, smooth and an almost velvety texture which gently brushes open your taste buds to leave you wanting to finish the bottle! It gave a slight dry after-taste and an almost non-existent harshness to the overall experience.

Thankfully, the previous homeowners have managed to preserve much of the original character of our home. We have thick Miami-Dade pine frames around all doorways and windows. We have a beautiful coral fireplace. And, we even have a barn — complete with the original doors! Of course, we currently use it as a garage but we intend to convert it into a two-story architect’s studio (for my husband) with a roof-top deck. However, we will keep the first floor (with original doors) completely intact.

And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came. And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial: The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man. Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day. And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
Our role as catalyst, facilitator or even midwife (a Dave Snowden favourite) might be vital in building vibrant knowledge sharing networks able to advise and make appropriate decisions in the face of future uncertainty, especially in this case, for the survival of local wildlife and habitat.
The arrangements are fairly convenient. We park our car at Uncle Johnny’s Hostel on the Nolichucky River in Erwin, and he gives our small party a ride to Hot Springs. From there we are committed to walk at least as back to Erwin (how else would we get back to the car but walk?) Arriving at Erwin mid-week, we can go further north once we secure another ride from Uncle Johhny back to the car on Friday or Saturday.
A lot of things that are inexpensive now will be invaluable later. As the economy collapses even further, people will be focused on survival and the barter system will reignite. Barter items will be far better than cash – you can’t eat a dollar!
I took a seat and waited patiently for my Tok Tok Mee! The air was filled with the nice aroma of Tok Tok Mee when it was served. Tok Tok Mee is actually flat dried noodles that have been fried till the wok hei (hot wok) smell are infused into it.

Joseph spends his time eavesdropping on his neighbors’ phone calls, an odd hobby for a retired judge. Valentine is struck by his honesty and fascinated with his outlook on life, shaped by years of his profession. Now, he is a voyeur, listening to other people’s conversations while he has no life of his own. She believes that people are basically good while he believes the opposite, which was no doubt cultivated over years of seeing the worst of humanity paraded in front of him. Valentine inspires Joseph to reconnect with humanity while he inspires her to be more independent and proactive in her relationships.
I know that the vintage floral shirts I used to love now make me look like one of my least favorite English teacher when I was in school, rather than boyishly fun and appealing. Sugary pastels are definitely a no-no. More on more, I find myself choosing clothes of a darker shade. I head for block colors and checkered patterns.

One advantage When We Were Executioners has over Eyes Like Leaves is an interesting ambiguity. After 25 pages of When We Were Executioners, I have no idea whether my sympathies should be with the demon-hunters or the demon-tainted, and I'm not sure there would be a clear answer even if I had read the preceding volume. In contrast, Eyes Like Leaves presents a standard good-against-evil conflict. I suspect this difference has much to do with when the books were actually written. In 1980, when de Lint was writing his novel, good-against-evil was generally how high fantasy was done; today, readers expect more shades of gray.
But the bacterial flagellum couldn’t have made a series of tiny changes, because many of those changes would not help a living thing out. The propeller (which looks like a rat’s tail) would have just sat there until it worked. That would mean many bacteria would have had to keep the propeller mutation before it served any purpose. But evolution can’t plan for purpose.
Their furniture is perfect for apartment living and life with small kids. The sofa we have has a white cover, but we can remove the cover easily and wash it. If it is damaged, a new cover can be purchased at IKEA with a small cost. If we sell it in the future, a buyer can purchase a new cover for this sofa, which was a big appeal to us.

She continued playing (and occasionally watched some Backyardigans - I am not above distracting her to get a few minutes to myself in the afternoon) and every so often I would look over and we would grin at each other over whatever toy she was stuffing in her mouth. And, ooh, wasn't that cute, she was gnawing on one of her Little People... Wait. M doesn't have any bright blue Little People.

On the next flight, I sit above the wing. The tarmac is still cloaked in snow. The plane moves beneath a crane, holding up a little yellow box with “GLOBAL AIR PLUS” written on it in black paint. There is a man inside. The crane sends the yellow box soaring over us, and the man inside sprays the plane with white foam. I wonder if he can listen to the radio while he waits for the planes to taxi. He just about fills up his little yellow box. It wobbles in the snow and the wind. He sprays the plane with green goo. The crane moves the little yellow box away from the plane. He waves us on. We are gaining speed. In a crash, I would squeeze the armrests for comfort. I would not shut my eyes. On my way to the little park, I would attempt to be graceful. I would think of you. I would remember how, when I set my foot on the moving sidewalk to be carried from long-term parking to check in, how I wanted to come back home to check, to make sure, I locked the door and said goodbye.

“This capstone meteorology course has been quite a large success,” he said. “Perhaps the success can be measured by great forecasting and travel decisions that get us to the storms on time.

I told him I admired his name and he explained that he was not born with it. He had been walking one day when a newspaper was blown by the wind against his leg. He picked it up and saw an obituary column. A boy had died when he was less than a year old and his name had been “Zachariah Zarathustra Jones.” The name was too beautiful to waste so he had decided to use it.
Stunned and hoping for a miracle Peter did his best to stay still even though Abelle made a point of checking on him every few minutes. The pain returned when he saw Abelle opened the door for the room service she ordered, rage coursed through Peter’s body as he heard her joke to the maid about him being exhausted and fast asleep. The pain forced Peter to calm down and clear his mind.
I almost was going to include them on this list and make it seven instead of five, but decided no, even as I was seeing these two Allen classics I knew other films weren't going to be like that, & was therefore not disappointed when they weren't like that.

My semester starts tomorrow and I really won't have time to get back in the swing of the things like I want (re-rip/download, re-eq, re-tag, etc.) . I have 1000's of files to browse though and decide what to salvage as I don't have space to just copy it all on an external HD. I'm still trying to find out if there's a way to either repair the files or to back track. It's very annoying that in addition to my recent files being harmed, many old and random files were effected too.
The tank kept hitting some enemies but no real harm since the cannon could only hurt one figure. Besides, the NIs squad had 3 armor-piercing weapons with them. While dealing with the NIs commander in the bunker, the tank lost patience and rammed straight into the enemy squad. It killed one of them but was left completely exposed so her guys just destroyed him and that increased their cover area. The missile launcher actually missed, it deviated back into the unit, killed a couple of its own guys, but in the end hurt the tank helping the tank busting effort.
To fill in the backstory, when me and the Missus hooked up, she had a cocker spaniel named Dudley, who was, shall we say, rather flamboyant in his attitudes. He didn’t so much reign as ruler of his kingdom as he did prance around it looking pretty. Only reason I bring that up is it seems to be a trend with dogs owned by the Missus.

Pakistan borders China and former constituent parts of the Soviet Union in which the US now has military bases on Russia’s borders. US war upon and occupation of Pakistan is likely to awaken the somnolent Russians and Chinese.

Free State Brewing is at the northern end of the Midwestern college town of Lawrence, Kansas in an old, narrow two-story building. When it opened in 1989, it was the first legal brewery to open in Kansas in 100 years. It's a brewery that wears it's local Civil War-era history heavy on its sleeve, with beers such as Emancipation Pale Ale, or the John Brown Ale, named after the militant abolitionist.

A very important fact that South Africans should aware of, is that farmers have always been targets on the African continent, and not only in Southern Africa. Christian farmers who have plans to relocate to the Congo, should therefore be most wary about this venture. (See also related posts: The irresistible urge to go farming and Beware of the Congo).
No one sees a beautiful garden and believes that it happened by itself. Or that it is the product of an unguided, mindless process. When you see a beautiful garden it makes perfect sense to think it is the work of a gardener. Even if he’s not at that moment visible to you. Even if you have never seen the gardener, met the gardener, spoken to the gardener or even heard from someone else that there is a gardener.

It is this pattern which prevents a clear signal to people, policymakers and markets about our predicament. We seemed to be crossing the Rubicon of peak oil in 2008 as prices rose to $147 a barrel only to cross back during the subsequent two and a half years leading to a new nominal peak in production in January this year. In between the price of oil plummeted to around $35 a barrel before rebounding above $100.
Where did the week go? The time seems to have flown by - and I haven't even been doing anything much.
This bothered me on so many levels, especially since my dad died having had only two girls, so not only is his last name gone, but also his living memories as well. .

One essential oil that is used in aromatherapy is rosemary. So many studies have shown that rosemary helps in boosting one's mood and it provides a feeling of contentment. In addition, it also regulates the production of cortisol, also known as the stress hormone.

I'm lucky in that, I suppose - I sound and look so much like mom, and the resemblance just grows stronger with each passing year. I put on a winter hat that she wore when she was doing chemo, with my hair pulled back, and got a jolt when I saw myself in the car window. I don't always notice it from day to day but...yeah, it catches me off guard sometimes.

More likely, though, it’s about feeling that you yourself are not enough, without the money solution to back you up. So let yourself dwell in uncertainty, and keep trying to create solutions that aren’t the easiest, most obvious thing. That’s how you let the Universe in to work magic in your life.
At the Chapman's we drank cup after cup of tea and gobbled up latkes before they were cool enough for our tongues. The kids spoke longingly of the melting snow but the adults cast sidelong looks at the backyard and spoke of summer. Oh summer. You are such a heartbreaker. These days I can barely even believe in you. You may or may not be real.

Checking one of two external links that still work on the Wikipedia page, I came across a federal lawsuit that mentions "Mojo," Anna Cole and Muddy. In this suit, a woman named Ruth Stratchborneo was suing songwriter Preston "Red" Foster, who wrote "Got My Mojo Working" as well as Muddy Waters and Dare Records owner Saul Rabinowitz, who introduced the song to Anne Cole.

This accounts for the acceptance of favoured historic British, US and Australian foreign investment and control, and the alarm when China enters the field to buy NZ assets. Now that China is becoming an economic power, and obviously seen by the US as a challenger to its Pacific hegemony, there are those in NZ who conflate the

As a child who was so often carried away , metaphorically, by drawing, naturally I was entranced by a little Boy named Simon, who , in fact, did draw things that came to life. I am still enchanted by the power of art and creation.There truly is something magical about envisioning something and seeing it come to fruition. I had this thought when poring through some cake sketches. To see your concept, or even a germ of a concept actually materialize still has the power to amaze me.
The ride was uneventful and provided little excitement except for when Jordan’s loose chain came off the rear sprocket and mangled a link, creating a 90 degree angle in the middle of the chain. Of course, this happened on a lonely road in the middle of the desert, probably at high noon. We didn’t have the tool to break the chain in order to remove it and replace it with the new chain which was sitting in his panniers.
So whatever you're doing, be sure you're connecting. Even if it just trying to see life from the standpoint of a teenager, or a mother-in-law, or a husband who doesn't support your homeschooling ideas, you won't get anywhere if you don't stop for a minute and try walking in that person's shoes.

The agreement we signed today sends a clear message to the Afghan people: as you stand up, you will not stand alone. It establishes the basis of our cooperation over the next decade, including shared commitments to combat terrorism and strengthen democratic institutions. It supports Afghan efforts to advance development and dignity for their people. And it includes Afghan commitments to transparency and accountability, and to protect the human rights of all Afghans – men and women, boys and girls.
I need to be able to live through the days knowing that I’m in the process of getting to know myself more. I want to know what I want in life first before I could ever get myself mixed up in a relationship again. Some people may understand this, some may choose not to. But then again, I know that this is for the best.

The Opposite of Tidy by Carrie Mac is the first novel I've read that has so openly spoken of the issues when it comes to having a family member who is a helpless hoarder. Like many other individuals, I myself have sat in front of the television watching "Hoarders", real life situations where people find themselves being nearly buried alive in items and trash that they just can't part with. Unfortunately, I've never understood much of what a hoarder goes through or their emotional attachment to their belongings, but The Opposite of Tidy certainly helped me down the path of understanding.

We had friends staying for a few days, their first visit here. Old friends, - we've known them since '76 as we were all in Oxford, the DH earlier as he went to school with him. I knew him & therefore her when he was in a band; she & I were long term groupies, I guess we still are!

There I was, quietly reading away this morning when, in a trice, I found myself swept back into the past. I was a young girl again, watching my father struggle to his feet, put on his gardening hat and declare in a resigned but relatively cheerful voice, ‘Well, I’d better get going again. No rest for the wicked!’

Once the primer was dry, I used an angled brush to paint everything with Olympic No-VOC latex paint color-matched to Valspar's Swiss Coffee in a satin finish. It's a beautiful, creamy white with warm undertones. I used two coats on all the inside surfaces and three coats on the outside surfaces. I added Dynaflo Oil Extender to the primer and Dynaflo Latex Extender to the latex paint. These additives extend the drying time of the paint to reduce drag and the appearance of brush strokes. I was impressed by how much of a difference it made! Finally, I brushed on two coats of Minwax Water-Based Polycrylic in a satin finish. Polycrylic protects the furniture and makes it easier to clean. This is one of the few products that doesn't develop an amber hue with age, so I recommend it for white-painted furniture. I noticed that the satin finish of the poly was quite a bit more glossy than the satin finish of the paint, so keep that in mind.
Geek Chic Cosmetics Joystick in Lipstick of the Shifting Sands was a surprising hit with me. I knew from the photo and description that it'd be pretty, but when I tried it on it was one of those shades that just worked. The website describes it as a 'bright pink just loaded with silver shimmer' which doesn't even begin to describe how beautiful it is. It's bright and eye-catching without being too obnoxious, it has a sheen without being incredibly frosty, and it applies like an absolute dream.

A venerable rule for writers, but not necessarily so venerable for GMs. In a Horror RPG, a vampire is not ‘a vampire’. A vampire is a pale, handsome man with a plastic smile and eyes so dark they seem like pits. His handshake is cool, hard, and with no sign of a pulse–like shaking the hand of a store mannequin. The zombies that are chasing you? Describe their smell. Describe the sound of their bloody feet spattering against the pavement as they shamble closer. Your gun doesn’t do ’7 points of damage’, it rips a bloody hole through the fleshy part of the alien’s bat-like wings, releasing a stale odor of something cold and ancient that tingles at the back of your throat. Now, its beetley head and compound eyes swivel from the child half-eaten by its gory mandibles and, in a way that chills your bones, you know that it sees you. And it hates.

She quickly disappeared into the side street and Brett was checking on his parents and notifying them of what happened. Meanwhile, a girl with a camera stopped me and said, “Photo?” I was stunned by what I’d just seen (both the attempted stealing and my husband bopping a woman with a book!), so I ignored her and kept walking, wondering if it was a diversion. I felt really guilty later because I don’t they had anything to do with the pickpocket.

“Get up,” she said as she hoisted Olivia out of her chair. As Olivia got up her jumpsuit fell to her ankles. She was standing in front of Pam stark naked her beautiful olive skin in full view. It was a feast for Pam’s eyes. Pam took the nightstick and dragged it up and down Olivia’s butt crack. She then walked around in front of Olivia and stuck it hard right between Olivia’s legs. Olivia closed her eyes as she let out a sharp moan. The nightstick was cold against her clit. Pam started to slide the nightstick up and down against Olivia’s neatly trimmed bush. Pam could hear Olivia’s faint moans and sighs with every stroke. Pam again walked around behind Olivia.

Of course London does not have the resources to do anything as fancy or extravagant as Beijing showed us in 2008, but they plan on putting a great show just the same. Yet as any Olympics, the city has had its issues. A protest during the University Boat race between Oxford and Cambridge two weeks ago, when a man jumped into the River Thames and disrupted the race, has caused a rethink in Olympic Games security policy.

Indeed, this Western is actually a melodrama in genre drag, especially since Vienna keeps switching back and forth between long, flowing, feminine gowns and more manly gunslinger clothes. Her counterpart, Emma, on the other hand, remains in her funeral black for the bulk of the film, and in contrast to Vienna's carefully lit studio closeups, Emma is captured in increasingly frazzled states of derangement and disarray. As Vienna maintains her self-possession even in her moments of the most melodramatic emotional excess, Emma snarls and spits like an animal, her hair growing disheveled around her head, her teeth constantly exposed in a smile that looks like a grimace.
Nøgne Ø Saison on tap turned out to be every bit as wonderful as its brother Nøgne Ø IPA. The Saison was sharp and hoppy, not like the IPA in terms of brutal hop astringency, but more restrained, more refined even.

I realise that I'm probably the last person to catch up with the Australian TV series Wilfred. I know it's been going on long enough to have spawned an American version which probably isn't as good. Still, it's made me laugh - actually laugh as in the involuntary bodily movement meaning of the word - more than anything in quite a while. Obviously you all know this already but, for the benefit of the one person who's even less "in touch" than me, this is how it works.

From the time I heard, RGV had made some drastic changes to the original script, making it more modern, I knew this was a recipe for trouble! If he pulls it off, it will be a raging success, else a colossal mess. And thats what happened! To date, RGV ki aag is voted as the biggest disaster of the millenium. I refuse to believe that a man of his calibre, could not see the disaster he was concocting. Then the next question is why did he still go ahead with it? Was he too arrogant to even notice the blunders? Or was he left with no choice? Or was he so self-obssessed that it clouded his thinking? What were the actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Ajay Devgn thinking?
This account reminds me of Joseph. His story begins with a dream, arrogance and some angry brothers. He had been given this gift but, because of his immaturity, chose to use it to antagonize his brothers. In retaliation, his brothers threw him into a pit damaging his pride and leading him into a life of misunderstandings. It seems as though every time Joseph found favor, it was stripped away from him. He did the right things and honored God with his behavior and yet, he found himself wrongly accused. As Joseph grew and lived out the difficult life he had, he eventually learned that God gave him his gift as a springboard to greater things. His purpose didn’t stop with dream interpretation. God was grooming him to be leader over Egypt. Had Joseph not endured the difficulties he encountered, he would have remained that pompous boy who sought his own satisfaction. He would not have learned humility, forgiveness and honor. In the end, Joseph was not only reunited with his family, he was able to bless them.

Not the least of which is mulching. Over the three mornings I trimmed hedges, pulled weeds, dead headed flowers and then raked and hauled. Then raked and hauled some more.

Last season was extremely busy. We were in such high demand, and had so many performances, in addition to all of our bi-monthly rehearsals, that we pretty much exhausted our people's spare time and energy.

We got through passport control and security and emerged into the departure lounge. Bangkok airport is rather large and we traipsed along the wide boulevards lined with boutiques in search of a bite to eat – the boys had not eaten much of their breakfasts.

Tania headed off to check out perfumes and on her return we realised that we were a little late and our flight was on last call.

Now getting a musician into a fMRI machine and getting him to perform and keep still was never going to be an easy task but neuroscientist Charles Lamb decided to give it a go.

In my defence I didn't fully know what I felt, but that's still not much of an excuse.

The capital of the small Republic of South Ossetia is increasingly seen as the next target of Georgian military aggression, and many here worry that it is only a matter of time before enemy troops unleash an assault on the city.

No easy task ahead: the hillside was satiated from the endless rain. That morning it continued, then snowed, and rained again, but fortunately subsided as they began to work. The first attempt to drive up the incline was aborted_ the truck tires spun in the wet clay.
It’s two-posts Friday! Well, at least this Friday it is.
So, here they all were, aboard the MS Atlantica for two weeks of heaven knows what, and this time they were going it alone. This time they were in charge of their own destiny. No manager, not even a record company as yet, but hopefully that could all change if this trip was a success. They’d be getting some excellent TV exposure, the money they were being paid wasn’t bad, and who knew? Maybe Bon Voyage could do what everyone thought was impossible. Maybe they could actually make a comeback, and whip up the same kind of hysteria they’d created
Some things, however, aren't quite as popular in the "cravings" department.
Apparently "supergraphics" were a thing in 1971. And, apparently, men didn't know anything about them. In case you are not privy to the art and beauty of supergraphics, this ad for Lucite Wall Paint in Better Homes and Gardens explains:
Hello hello.
Aswad’s Live & Direct album (conservatively described as a mini LP, but featuring 12 songs) was a live recording, made at the 1983 Notting Hill Carnival, and epitomising the band in their heyday. This recording narrowly predates the widespread integration of electronic instrumentation into reggae, and the revisions to the music’s structural parameters which progressively stripped out the guitar offbeat pattern. On this album, guitar offbeats sitting around a ‘half time’ drum groove are still pretty much obligatory. This is traditional, ‘old style’ reggae. There are also some great dub-style sections – it must have taken some doing to reproduce the dub feel (originally created in recording studios with effects, a mixing desk, and plenty of trial and error) live on stage. Some of the studio echos would be faked on stage through musicianship and technique rather than with electronics, and to do it convincingly required skill and masses of experience.
Research has demonstrated that the conventional belief that yawns are caused due to a high level of carbon dioxide or a shortage of oxygen in the blood or brain, is completely false. However, after comparing some of the similarities between the physiology of yawning and that of sex, it has been suggested that the two acts might have a common neurological background.
Good morning, and Happy Pink Saturday. If y'all read THIS POST, you know that Connie and I have been doing a lot of work at Mark's and Sandi's house. After we complete the work outside, I will show you what we've done to the exterior as promised.
Alternatively, coaching can be used to develop internal employees to realize their individual and collective potential – readying them for promotion. In addition, coaching can be used to aid those same employees to re-calibrate their thinking and behavior to adjust to the new position. Although the transition may be difficult, an effective coach will be able to work with those employees in their new roles to help them gain perspective and understanding on what they need to do differently in their new assignment in order to be successful. Companies need to strategically invest in their existing employees and high potentials through one-on-one coaching plus other ways; offering stretch experiences to employees in order to cultivate their individual skill sets as well as to develop their relationships with peers, subordinates and bosses. Managers must help their direct reports to find ways to realize individual and collective potential. We at Liberty Business Strategies, in addition to executive coaching, have developed a unique offering involving peer-to-peer coaching to help leverage existing relationships, experiences and observations of the relevant peer group.
I took a deep breath. I always want to be polite so I told V to have fun and I'll see him soon.
Although the fight didn’t really start in Griffin’s favor, it was certainly good to be Cody at the end of his first bout in the 8 man ProElite tournament. After being on the losing end of the first two rounds based on the controlling ground game and wrestling of the much larger Justyn Riley, Cody Griffin showed why he deserves to be fighting on HDNet.

Georgian Colonial style is very common and has many variations. The best-known Georgian homes are of red brick, although wood siding is also common. Georgian homes are simply massed; usually have a centered front door; double-hung windows; and a gabled or hipped roof. Georgians range in decoration from the very plain to the very elaborate.

A few months ago I blogged about monkeys. Monkeys being your stresses, worries, concerns, chores and anything else that makes you feel like a headless chicken. So my mission was to become monkey free in time for the dreaded two week wait.
I had a conversation last night with my neighbour over coffee about if he believed in such thing as the one, and if he did, what he believed the one to be. His answer left me a little disappointed as I realised that perhaps my definition of the one was far too unrealistic compared to his definition, and this got me thinking… Okay, so there is such thing as the one, because we do actually all believe in the one; it just depends on how we define it. I then found myself asking a number of people if they could define the one for me. First of all my father, bless him, agreed with me that the one is that person who, when you come face to face with them it is like something hits you, like an explosion, like magic; you just know, you just feel it; like the universe has given you some kind of sign that this person is indeed the one for you, and that all of the rest of it comes into place; the comfort, the safety, the love, the passion, all of it and more. I then found myself asking some of my friends and their definitions were somewhat different.

Barrelling out of the door with his head down, he saw nothing except the floor, his eyes half closed with fury anyway. The next thing he knew, he felt his shoulder slam into an obstruction, and heard a shriek of rage as someone staggered backwards and slipped, landing in a muddy puddle.

Back in December, I'd gone grocery shopping one Saturday morning, and while at the store, picked up a few stocking stuffers for Christmas. When I got home, I hurried to my closet to squirrel away said stocking stuffers, away from the eyes of husbands and children, then I headed to the kitchen to unload the rest of my purchases.
I hit the ‘Snooze’ button on my alarm clock and buried my face in my pillow. It was my first day at Toasterville High, and I was absolutely dreading it. What if I didn’t make any friends? What if I was too far behind in my classes and they wouldn’t let me graduate at the end of the year? More than anything, I wished that I was still back in Monkeywrench Heights, at my old school with my old friends.
After much expectation on the effect of the 10% off-throttle limit, what transpired over the opening practice sessions brought more confusion than clarification. As practice got under way it transpires that the expected 10% limit was in fact not applied to all teams, nor was the dispensation to the different engine manufacturers communicated clearly to all the others. This brought much confusion to fans and media alike, as well as bringing a heated debate between Martin Whitmarsh and Christian Horner in the Friday press conference. Its been reported that Renault engines have been dispensation to run at up to 50% throttle when the driver is off the throttle pedal, and slightly less well reported that Mercedes engined teams are able to run a fired overrun.

So with that being said I’ve developed a list of rules for the casual, ongoing hook-ups. You might think “duh, it’s obvious” but it really isn’t and that makes for some major miscommunication issues.
On both occasions, within a few years, most Americans' portfolio values would have been slashed in half. (And maybe it should have happened! The Democrats should not have prevented it. The ensuing turmoil and anger - perhaps reaching French Revolution levels - might have “solved the oligarchy problem" for a generation. A bit (a lot) more severely than I'd prefer. But at least there'd be no debilitating, lobotomizing, murdochian "culture war" by now.)
Today was the day the Credit Center had their monthly meeting with the loan officer to make scheduled payments on their loans. The women sat in chairs in a straight line under some trees, while the loan officer — who arrives by motorcycle and carries the cash in a knapsack(!) –sat at a wobbly card table facing them. The loan officer takes attendance and then one woman, who’s been elected the leader of her Solidarity group, hands over her group’s cash, and signs her name on a paper receipt which she gets a copy of. If she can’t sign her name, she signs with a “+” sign. One women signed with two “+” signs.
I am of course stating the obvious to most of you. My blog entry today is not going to be any extensive how-to on the subject of search engine optimization or building a website or anything of this nature. And since I am no expert on these types of topics I can only allude to them and recommend that you do your own research in the many books, blogs, and websites that are dedicated to these topics.
Hope everyone is staying warm. Hear it's cold just about everywhere...even the Sunshine State!!!!!
Recently, an article was written entitled Mean Girls Mellow with Age (except on TV), which stemmed from an article in the Washington Post. The article provided research conducted in 2009 by Centers for Disease Control where 9th through 12th graders took a survey on Relational Aggression and maturity. Another mention was a study conducted at a Southeastern University where 202 undergraduates took a survey and the findings indicated that freshmen were more aggressive where seniors started looking at the behavior as immature. Adult survivors who found their childhood abusers to be mature and nice people shared a couple of stories. One of the girls interviewed stated that she befriended her bully on Facebook and the bully wished her a Happy Birthday. “She was perfectly nice,” she stated. Another girl stated that her former tormentor would egg her house during the teen years. As an adult, the girl apologized and told her that her parents were divorcing at the time and was having a hard time herself so she took it out on the girl. “Her apology freed me to realize that we all suffer in those adolescent years,” she stated.
As incarceration rates fall and prisons close, new thinking about the relationship between crime and imprisonment could push the downward trend further, faster. Liptak's piece quotes extensively from the findings of criminologist Franklin Zimring, who suggests that crime rates have as little to do with incarceration rates (a conservative tenant) as they do with unemployement rates (a liberal truism).
On Friday just in the midst of the tail end of the crisis (that might not be over for quite sometime officially), my husband got a phone call about a company looking to possibly hire him for the summer for some out of town work. Yea!

Potion of Treasure Finding: An interesting potions that for 5d4 rounds lets a person detect in which direction treasure is where treasure is defined as valuables with a value equal to or greater then 50 gold or 100 gems. Of course like most such sensing magics it is blocked by lead so you can still protect any really important hoard of treasure while also giving you an excellent way to trap a party in their own greed. You don't even really need to actively make traps to do so as generally where there is a lot of treasure there is also a lot of monsters such as a lair.
If you struggle with anxiety start slow first get used to recognizing situations that are going to be triggering. Then learn to ground yourself before those situations then take on this step after you feel you have a really good grasp on the first 2. It;s worth a try. I am thankful to my counselor Jennifer for helping me to do it in steps as I often try to skip small steps and shoot for the main goal. However i do know that about myself. So i am able to stop myself from doing it. When I coach gymnastics i insist on the children going through different progressions to be able to move on to the next step of a move. If i didn’t children would get injured because they weren’t prepared. I hadn’t prepared them. It’s the same for us we need to follow progressions and work up to things or we risk crashing hard. And believe me i have crashed hard in gymnastics and with my eating disorder and other negative things like running away etc.
But is that all that February 14th marks?
“I will send a chicken ahead so he can tell us what is there!” said Bantum, but Star reminded him that it might be dangerous for the chicken if he did that, at which suggestion Bantum refrained from tossing Dr. Chickenhiemer into the darkness, to the miserably clucking bird’s great relief. The other chickens, as you can imagine, were hanging from the bandoleer squawking and flapping their wings in various states of frantic anxiety.
Good soloing is not exclusive to metal, of course: Johnny Marr was probably the most influential British guitarist of the 1980s, with good reason. Check out the beautiful gossamer shimmer of “Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others”: not only does it create a vivid atmosphere, they give a sense of yearning beauty that Morrissey’s tongue-in-cheek lyric fails to capture. The vibrato-rich, glossy black solo by Bernard Butler in Suede’s “The Asphalt World” similarly creates a world of epic longing and tortured poetry which redouble the effect of verses, which verge on the absurd. (Butler wanted the song (and solo) to be longer – I often think he was right. Structurally, the song is similar to Pink Floyd’s “Echoes” – itself over 17 minutes). And how about the solo in Television’s “Marquee Moon”? Just savour the guitar interplay.
Oh, how easy life would be! To be able to pick and choose ones friends, employer and weed out would-be disastrous dates with such broad sartorial brushstrokes. No stylistic nuances, decade blending or micro-trends obfuscating the general view; just plain and simple style atavism.
My therapist just looked at me and said she saw none of that in the person I was now. And it was true. Apparently I am, unknowingly or admittedly, some sort of social butterfly; talkative and witty, charming and humorous is what I hear most often. At the Transgender Day of Remembrance I recently attended, one of my friends remarked that she was asked how she had become aware of the event. When she mentioned that she had heard about it from Christen, there were remarks of, "oh yeah... you know Christen? Cool!". It is so weird as I never really had a lot of friends growing up and into my adult life. I would say that I was a co-worker or an acquaintance or someone to talk to in the office but friends... people I could talk to and share my life with numbered in the single digits.
I highly recommend them as must reads for lovers of dark horror fiction.

Yes, that is really me in 1959, when I was all of three years old. Getting married was her idea, and I guess it didn’t bother her that she was a head taller than me, and that she also had much better fashion sense than I did, when picking out a pair of shorts.

People are recommended to practice concentration techniques like meditating on the breath and so on to reduce stress in work-life. While that is indeed a great idea, its also smarter to utilize certain parts of your work itself as your stress busting technique. Routine work is a blessing in disguise when you are able to execute such work with not only an aim to get the work done, but also to receive its beneficial ‘side-effects’ for yourself, which is focus and relaxation.
Coffee splashes over you. Your daughter is about to cry. You gently say, "It's ok honey, you just need, to be more careful next time". Grabbing a towel you rush upstairs. After grabbing a new shirt and your briefcase, you come back down in time to look through the window and see your child getting on the bus. She turns and waves. You arrive 5 minutes early and cheerfully greet the staff. Your boss comments on how good the day you are having.

As much as I hate doing grammar exercises, it is nice to be able to talk to someone who is going through exactly the same thing as me, who has all the same hopes and concerns, who is at the same point in her life as I am, who has gone through or is going through all the same hurdles, and who basically just “gets it”.
Between hands, I tried to explain that this was a Japanese craft brewer and that this beer was a special thing to find here in Ise. The Yona Yona was easier to sell, since its name and label make it stand out a bit, but even among American citizens craft beer is poorly understood.
Yes, I wish I had a different process that didn't include hallways of notes that never see the light of day and yet at the same time, I've started to embrace the process I do have. Because by putting all those notes together I understood more about the structure of the book and the characters and their roles individually and together.

I stamped the post card image with brown Memento ink and distressed the edges a bit with brown ink and a few swipes of pale pink acrylic paint. I backed that with olive green and used my (very) old postage stamp scissors. (Remember when all the funky scissors were the big rage? Yep......I got 'em all! ; ) The image was stamped in green and blue ink and covered with clear embossing powder. (Apparently, I am on a bit of an embossing kick!) I used that postage stamp again in red this time. : )

Hello those of you who 'follow' me......I know I am not a great blogger - I just don't have a lot of time especially at the moment.
I paddle a canoe as a past-time. Beyond the simple mechanics of paddling is the actual dance of the canoe. We create the sheer poetry of motion by making a rhythm or even music with the canoe; literally making the canoe dance. Just as there are no wrong notes in making music (at least in the purest sense), even if we don’t know the exact correct paddle strokes, we can move that canoe, creating our own poetry or dance. As we become more proficient in paddling we can create a more intricate dance. But when we come to add emotion to our paddling, we create a vision. Then that canoe dance almost seems to takes on a life of its own. It is more than just mere paddling…almost as if that canoe becomes an extension of ourselves. Freeing ourselves. And the canoe is the vehicle or instrument to such freedom. The freedom found in making beautiful music together with my canoe. – Mike Ormsby

If your home was built before 1920, its external walls are probably solid rather than cavity walls. Cavity walls are made of two layers with a small gap or ‘cavity’ between them. Solid walls have no such gap, so they let more heat through. Solid walls can be insulated – either from the inside or the outside. This will cost more than insulating a standard cavity wall, but the savings on your heating bills will be bigger too.
I have written elsewhere that ninety percent of Orthodoxy is “just showing up.” I meant then and repeat now that the slow work of transformation requires our presence within and to the ecclesia, the Church gathered. My forgiveness of others is often a rebuke of my own passions: I find you irritating, because I am governed by my passions. Christianity, from the time of its gifting to us by Christ, has consisted of daily taking up our cross and following Him. It is a road of dispassionate living.

She won’t give up on someone she’s loved for so long.
