This release coordinates with the JustRite Custom Dies I designed for the CHA 2012 Release. The stamps fit into the Nested Medallion Label Dies and the Nested Oval Medallion Label Dies. The dies make it so much easier to get a crisp cut out of the stamped image. The JustRite Custom Dies can be used in most of the leading die cut systems. I use the Cuttlebug by Provocraft. Being able to die cut the stamps can really make an image pop as the focal point.
Even after he became president, Reagan's fondness for Jelly Bellies didn't diminish, and large colorful jars of them were often prominently displayed on his desk in the Oval Office, in the Cabinet Room, and even on Air Force One.
Also, during the recordings there are always so many people TT …. Really thankful to everyone!!

*Challenge: Arriving back home to an empty (food-wise) house. Opted for: This made it really easy to make some bad decisions. This further supports my beliefs that preparation is the most critical factor to success. I failed to go shopping before I went out of town. I figured I’d just do it when I got back and didn’t think much of it. Until I came home to an empty fridge and a full day of work the next day. Next time before I head out of town, I’m going to make sure my freezer is stocked up with some easy healthy options to sustain me for a few days after a trip. That way I won’t get bumped off track by not being able to hit the grocery store immediately.
The Orono High School Speech and Debate Team is hosting its Third Annual 24-Hour Read-In at the OHS library from 6:00 p.m. Friday, April 27 until 6:00 p.m. Saturday, April 28.

It seems pretty clear that, in the situation that our subscriber presented, a separate loss the insured wants to adjust on a replacement-cost basis after the 180-day time limit outlined in the loss-payment section would receive the full replacement cost.

She tried to open his little hands (he looked like a two year old in size) only to recognize that his hands were red and chaffed. Later when she asked the doctor at the clinic what that could be, he said “He’s got some fungus problem. Who knows how long it’s been since he’s had a proper cleaning. No one puts the medicine on those hands to heal him. You must not worry about that because if you do start to work with him chances are you’ll be infected too.”

Now, you need to buy one Pomegranate. Have you ever opened one up? Neither had I! But, I knew about the "under-water trick". Why water? Pomegranate seeds stain. The water is a way to prevent the beautiful ruby-red juice from now staining your shirt, hands or anything else that's in the way.

Without pre-empting the questions that might arise, themes of otherness might surface. the world experienced as through a window, distanced. Or the way you return to philosophical conundrums like 'is the light off when the door is shut' - or 'strawberries wouldn't taste like strawberries if they are blue' (from another piece here) - and indeed the colour blue itself, which recurs through the collection, in a few places.

Pumping is also going good. I get about 5-7oz every 3 hours. I can't build a stash, since the girls eat a lot - so, I am normally about one feeding ahead of them. We have had to supplement with formula a few times - but thats fine. Like, I said - we are pretty laid back and just take things one day at a time. :-)
Moments like these are amongst my favorite of family traditions. As the kids grow older, I realize I have become much more sentimental and cherish these times even more!
The weekend was spent overseas; we had been invited to three days of celebrations for a good friend’s birthday. The events were to take place on the neighbouring Isle, and as usual it was no mean feat getting ourselves organised and onto that ferry boat, although we did have to succumb to a slightly reduced ‘party time table’, missing out on a clay pigeon shoot and cask visit.
A 2006 relocation proposal, revised in 2009, called for the movement of approximately 8,700 Marines and more than 9,000 dependents from Okinawa to facilities on the island of Guam some 1,500 miles to the southeast. This plan carried a price tag of some $21.1 billion in construction costs to execute. This plan has garnered increasingly antagonistic opposition from members of the US Congress. Key members of the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year suspended funding for the relocation until they received detailed briefings from the Pentagon to satisfy their demand that all viable options had been explored fully.

Good or bad? Well, the good - doing a signing event in a town in Western Australia which had a population of 125, and 75 people turned people turned up. So that was absolutely mad. And the other side of it is I’ve been to places where three people turn up, and one of them is in a pram.
Today, I am not cured. I haven't witnessed a miracle. However, I know I can do this. I am going to be fine. I do feel better today. Maybe I need to just do what I need to do and stop worrying about what everyone else thinks. and just maybe I NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE FAITH!

52% of Iowans see their senior senator Chuck Grassley favorably, and 33% unfavorably. They are not as hot on Tom Harkin, giving him a 46-40 mark, but that still puts him in a tie for 50th out of 86 senators on which we've polled. Grassley is tied for 25th. The two are equally popular with their own bases, but Grassley, at 39-45 with Democrats, is way more popular across the aisle than is Harkin (a still healthy 23-64 with Republicans). Grassley also bests Harkin with independents, 50-34 versus 39-45.

Eventually, we came to a consensus that a redesign of the existing template was best. Ms Zing said something in French that we later translated as advanced CSS coding, while Mr Moon performed a psychic experiment and announced that our readers preferred dark text on a light background. Chris and Gavin set to work on banners and backgrounds, while Mr Medcalf was heard to mutter words we dare not repeat on a family website and wonder off in search of tea. Sarah, meanwhile, waved around mint-scented pompoms and shouted encouragement.
The Founding Fathers revered John Locke, the Whig philosopher and supporter of the Glorious Revolution. Classical liberal thought is founded on his political philosophy. The preamble of the Declaration of Independence is a summary of Locke's philosophy of natural rights. Both libertarians and conservatives held Locke in highest esteem, the latter seeking to conserve the founding principles of our republic. It would seem odd to find in the esteemed publication of the ISI the following limerick (page 17):There once was a man named John Locke.

Hopefully Lather-on-us will get right on this. He’d BETTER, actually, considering how quick he always is to get on my ass for something way less than this. All I’m gonna say is if he lets this thing slide with Antlers, I better not be getting another protest in my front yard the next time I order the veal.
Alongside stories of the ‘Beastly Bosh’ turning people into soap, the lie-mongers spread stories of German soldiers raping and murdering women of all ages (from very young children to very old pensioners). In the Second World War these atrocities became a reality, although it was Russian and African-American soldiers, violating and murdering Germans with wholehearted Zionist encouragement, these real crimes were ignored. On the rare occasions when these atrocities were admitted, they were treated as justice for the suffering inflicted on the Jews!

The first human egg cells that have been grown entirely in the laboratory from stem cells could be fertilized later this year in a development that will revolutionize fertility treatment and might even lead to a reversal of the menopause in older women.
Relationships just don’t happen. They evolve over time. Successful people in business understand that relationship building is more like “farming” than “hunting”. Quality relationships are rarely pursued and captured. Rather, relationships are rooted in rich soil consisting of a blend of mutual trust, respect and shared values. When fully grown, relationships produce bonds and connections that enhance both parties’ opportunity to succeed.

Energizer filed a complaint with the ITC in April 2003, charging that about two dozen companies were infringing on US Patent 5,464,709, which disclosed a mercury-free electrolytic alkaline battery cell. The company sought an ITC order that would bar the infringing batteries from being imported into the United States.
For the creative person, lack of production is an affliction. The good news is my avocation (information junkie) has stood me in good stead.

Those answers we want, the assurances we feel we need in order to justify or validate our choice to unschool, can get us into serious trouble when they transition from simple wants and needs into expectations. We know that unschooling is the right path, but we want to ensure that our children are ready for whatever the world will throw at them now or in the future - so we use our familiar methods for evaluating their "learning" so we can determine whether or not unschooling is really working. We think of learning as a discrete activity, separated from the rest of our lives. We think about it in terms of classrooms and lectures. We look for the breadth of knowledge, we look for mastery of facts and figures, we look for the three Rs, and we use that to evaluate our child's progress.

It was delicious and filling, and definitely the perfect dinner on a cold winter’s night. Plus, it made so much that I have lots of leftovers. I paired it with some rice, but it would be great with some crusty sourdough bread.

So I only went to the gym once last month. That's frankly a bit embarrasing. Admittedly there were epic bike rides and gardening activities happening, but I just couldn't haul my ass out of bed to get there.

Of course there really is no recipe to give here. Once my bagel was sliced, I used cream cheese and a lovely piece of smoked salmon, I then added some chives and dill, a squeeze of lemon, and voila! I had a delicious (and quickly prepared) brunch.
#26. And because of that, I'm able to stay home with my children. So thankful for that! I may have already mentioned this one. But it's worth another mention. I love being able to be here. I love that my husband supports me in that. Wouldn't miss these moments for anything!
In reality, if the publisher is operating on Net, you should ask for 16% (instead of 10%) for the first 5000 copies and then do the math from there on up. (Because 16% of $15 is $2.40 per book—pretty close on to the cover price royalty calculation.)
Remember the last time you wrote a letter? Remember the last time you received a hand written letter? Ages it seems, doesn’t it? Who has the time now-a-days to write with a pen? Leave alone lack of time, who takes the trouble to pen a few words on paper when the computer is always there? And if you are not the very writing kind then, the email or the SMS is always there to communicate and keep in touch!! In today’s world, where everything has to be fast and convenient, the famous line, ‘the pen is mightier than the sword’ no longer stands true. Today’s line reads, ‘The keyboard is mightier than the pen.’ Sad to say, but today, the pen is no longer strong and mighty.
In keeping with NPS guidelines and approval by the State of Wisconsin, trail work in the park using heavy machinery or motorized equipment was prohibited... The way it usually worked was that a crew of about six would be assigned a section of trail. A LEM went along at first to make sure proper safety procedures were followed. Enrollees were allowed to use winches, steel leverage rods and chains to get the job done...
Digging into the historical society’s archives, as well as old articles from the Brooklyn Eagle, The New York Times and the New York Tribune, Morrone was able to piece together not only some of the more fascinating events, institutions and personalities that have defined the neighborhood’s landscape, but also the way in which the area has been perceived over time, such as when the Times (wrongly) predicted that “the gentrification of places like Fort Greene will be a quaint relic of the 1980s like big hair.”
Remember your first pregnancy? Remember Saturdays? I remember lying around on the couch with Dan, watching tennis or golf on tv, because we knew it would be good background noise for us to have nap. And we could nap all day if we wanted. The only thing that was necessary to take care of on the weekends was finding a source of food. That was our ONLY obligation... eat and sleep.

Really, though, a lot of the genius is in the casting - Robert Downey Jr. may be approaching middle age, but he hasn't lost a bit of his energy. It's simply delightful to see him sink into the character of Tony Stark, which seems tailor-made for him. In fact, it's great just to see Downey working again, and at the top of his game. I thought he was a bizarre choice for an action hero when I first learned of the project, but I'm perfectly happy to be proven wrong here.
There are moments of poetry, quiet, and beauty. There are moments of great prose and insight. But frankly, it just isn't worth sifting through the tons of overwrought prose to find them.

The second day included a number of bars...things did get a little sketchy, but i know we started of at Henry's 12th Streeet Tavern...somewhat of an institution..not of the beer bar variety (though the 100 beers on tap did satiate our requirements). This was more of a fancy downtown hotel bar, lots of cocktails and some decent pub grub (check out the onion rings below!)

Hence (ii) calculate the power taken from the supply system when three 100? non inductive resistances are connected in (a) Y (b) across a 400V, 50Hz, 3??mains. (iii) In the event one of the resistances burn out, what would be the value of total power taken from the mains in each of the two cases?

So long story short: let's not divide girls and boys up any more than they already are. Blue on a girl? Awesome. Pink on a boy? Righteous. Let's celebrate "throwing like a girl" and "crying like a boy" and let boys play dad and girls play handywoman. Let's let them decide on their terms how they want to be defined, and not let the media and corporations decide for them. Let's teach them how to be awesome and think they are awesome and think that the opposite gender is pretty awesome too.
Here's another comedy that is filled to the gills with the kind of hilarity that carries an undertone of discomfiting seriousness to it. The perpetually underrated Elaine May's subject here is, to put it simply, the male ego, finding its embodiment in Lenny Cantrow (Charles Grodin), a handsome, callow guy who rushes into a marriage with Lila (Jeannie Berlin, May's daughter, who I also saw just a few weeks ago giving a great performance in Kenneth Lonergan's Margaret) only to find himself dissatisfied with her as a partner; he then meets blonde dream-girl Kelly (Cybill Shepherd) and immediately decides she, rather than Lila, is the one. Through all his machinations to try to win both Kelly and her protective father (Eddie Albert) over, as well as his attempts to break off his marriage with Lila, May observes with a detached but not wholly unsympathetic eye, twisting Lenny's vacuous "determination" for a wealth of cutting character comedy, all the way to a final shot that arguably says more about the limits of American ambition in one facial expression than Paul Thomas Anderson did with that hysterical 10-minute bowling-alley epilogue in There Will Be Blood.

Are you a wealthy comer to this place of rest, meals or portal to the other world? Go ahead and sit down in that chair, yeah the one with the back to the canvas.

See, Kate's Father or her Brother, would be waiting behind that curtain, sneak up on you when you were not expecting it, with the thirst of murder in their minds. Though it has been said the amount that was gained from the murders was only $4,600, so it was widely speculated that the Benders actually killed for the thrill of it.

However, building a great wardrobe is possible on a small budget. Clearly, one man’s small budget may be another’s small fortune. Nonetheless, the first and most important step in building a gentleman’s wardrobe is to decide what is the size of your budget over the course of a year; is it £150 per year, £350, £500, £1,000? Once you have a budget stick to it. A budget of £300 per year (£25 per month) over 5 years would provide £1,500 which is plenty to build wardrobe. So how might one go about a 5-year project?

I had a wonderful birthday. It was hard to say goodbye to 28. That number is so special to me and it's not a coincidence that I was 28 when Hadley was born, that she was born on the 28th, that her due date was June 28th...I could go on and on. 28 was a year of my life that I will absolutely never forget. I was blessed last year and I know God has many blessings in store for my 29th year :) Can't wait to see what they are!!

The backstage party had also been the best yet. The people from the label were there, and they put out a decadent spread of food and drink. How you got backstage, I never found out.

We had our welcome meeting where we met (most) of the rest of our group, save the few people with late flights. Our group of 15 included three couples, and the rest of us were on our own. It must be said, this was possibly the best group I've had. We all got along great, had lots of laughs, and nobody was perpetually late or perpetually stinky. I was the youngest person on the tour (which I loved - no crazy partying 18 year olds!), and many had done previous Gap/G tours, while always says quite a lot.

It's not like cream cheese is regularly in my shopping trolley and I have been known to make a cheesecake from leftover ricotta, Greek yoghurt and whatever else has been left in the fridge. I find it a bit rich (which is rich coming from me because I love rich food).
With the same manner of hesitance as Macbeth when he set off to kill Duncan, Beth rose from her seat to start a long walk to the back of the café where the author of her desires sat. The poet, lost in the scurrying movements of his pen, never looked up from the page at which he stared as Beth’s shy steps approached him. Every unsure footfall brought Beth closer, made the image larger, the whole scene more vivid, the fantasy more real. Staring at the top of James Stevens’s disheveled head, Beth reached the table. James remained lost in his own world. He dropped his pen onto the paper, pulled his hands up to massage his eyes, and then, Beth spoke, “Hello…”

Once I had self-published Pazuzu Book One, I rapidly grew discontent with the whole work – lack of readers and productive feedback helped encourage that mood. Addressing that angst and the fact I still hadn’t found a job, I split my story into, first, a series of four 60K-word books then condensed and later expanded them into a trilogy. Each book now contains approximately 90K words. As of this blog post, the books are at their Eighth Revision – as marked on the first pages of each book.
I've heard about this so-called "runner's high" after pushing yourself for 30-40 minutes...well this body had PLENTY 'O TIME to kick it in. All I felt was runner's pain! However, if runner's high can also be described as the 3-5 seconds you see stars before hitting the deck, well I could actually see that happening. Snicker Snicker! Wanna real laugh? I was perusing the results of last year's marathon....and there was an 87 year old woman that would've beat me by a minute! Jeeze!! I guess I should've started training way before now....like maybe 10 years ago. LOL

1) That we can do without 'labels' in poetry. Even the word 'poet' is a label we put on ourselves to distinguish ourselves from, say, prose-writers. The word 'writers' distinguishes us from 'non-writers', musicians, artists, etc... and from people who don't do 'creative' activities at all. Labels like 'avant garde', 'lingusitically innovative," "neo-formalist", "modernist" etc are often annoying and divisive when thrown around as weapons to put other poets down but help to understand where a poet is coming, and how the poem should be read (eg, if you know it's a "surrealist" poem, you won't be looking for the kind of logical sense you'd expect in a "movement" poet.)
In Chinese herbalism, magnolia bark, hou po, is associated with the stomach, lungs, spleen, and large intestine. It is used to treat menstrual cramps, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and gas, nausea , diarrhea, and indigestion.
Being contented and grateful for what you have is an important aspect of positive thinking. Thinking about what you don't have will only make you worry and lead you to be more dissatisfied with life. Focus on the positive in life. When you are contented, you are also motivated to achieve your dream.
For many people today it takes the presence of 'alive Christians' to lead them to Jesus. We live in a world of hurt, darkness, hate and greed. Christians need to be that ‘alive’ example. We cannot simply show up to church on Sunday, raise our hands in praise, wear crosses around our necks and claim to know him. We have to give him our all- with nothing held back- or its a half way, self-benefiting faith. For us to fully understand that- God allowed us to experience His heart- through an orphan. The day they placed that brown- eyed baby girl into my arms something inside of me broke. And through that brokenness- God was able to work.

In John 9:1-12 we know that the blind man has been healed physically. How do we know in verse s 35-38 that his spiritual eyes have been opened as well?
This is the strength of Mr. Alexie’s novel. He uses the teenage quest for identity that we all experience to discuss issues that represent an epidemic of poverty among a part of America that the general public never really tries to understand. If they did, then no one would wear hats with the Cleveland Indians logo, or jackets that say “Redskins” in red and gold, Land O’ Lakes butter wouldn’t be on the shelves, and there wouldn’t be a concrete Tepee east of Cherry Valley on U.S. Route 20 in New York (where no tribes ever built tepees). But remedying these surface issues is only the start. If poverty and racism are going to end, then education and skill-building amongst all populations in the United States are necessary.
Sunday, our last full day in the great city was jammed pack! We started the day by St. Patrick's Cathedral where the road was closed off for an Easter Parade. We then hopped in a cab and rode to Battery Park to catch a ferry and get our first glimpse of Lady Liberty. After a small debate and a short stint standing in line for tickets to Ellis Island, we decided on the Staten Island Ferry. While it would have been pretty special to see Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty up close, I didn't want to spend over an hour simply waiting to board the ferry on our last day there. The Staten Island Ferry was easy and gave us our chance to snap some photos. We absolutely froze because of course we had to stand outside, but again, completely worth it!
is perceived to be anti-American. END COMMENT) The emphasis is mine. It is disturbing but perhaps not surprising that the US ambassador is able to succinctly express the underlying realities of US-Australian relations at the highest level. It is one thing to say that "Australians will not elect a PM who is perceived to be anti-American" and quite another to imply that good relations with US diplomats are the price of the support an Australian politician can expect from colleagues such as Arbib, who called Gillard in the same cable "one of the most pragmatic politicians in the ALP". The right stuff indeed.

Cold fire is the term used for stage explosives. I was also responsible for 4 tons of soft goods. I couldn't sleep at night, and when I did, in my dreams, I checked and re-checked all the pre-sets; all the props, costumes etc. that needed to be in place long before the football game started. On the day of the game,the cast and crew were housed in what looked like a jail beneath the stadium. But I had been there since seven in the morning. Checking and re-checking, just like my nightmares. My palms were sweaty. Often I'd go into the ladies' room and put my feet up, so that anyone searching for me couldn't locate my tell-tale red high top sneakers.

“The Colour of the Year is an airy and optimistic blue that symbolizes infinite horizons, new beginnings, renewed energy and a positive dynamic. This clear, transparent shade encapsulates a sense of purity and goodness – a hopeful colour full of possibility. It puts over an image of vast skies, breezy ozone freshness and the energy and essentiality of water. Given these associations plus the fact that it is a receding colour it will always create a sense of space.

Consider the situation of having a friend that you knew had an addiction to morphine. This friend may have his/her life held together really well despite the addiction. However if you were to visit your friend on a day to have them act like a huge asshole to you only to apologise later saying ‘I am really sorry, I just haven’t had a hit of morphine for a few days and I feel like shit,’ you are probably not going to forget about it and act as if nothing ever happened.

Right now he is housesitting for Eryn and Tyler while they are in Europe. He's cooking for himself, looking after the cats and keeping the place tidy and when I dropped by the other evening, there he was sitting in the living room doing his math homework. And most amazingly, he is waking himself up in the morning. Incredible. Eryn says he is the baby of the family and maybe its true. Somehow I never worried about how Eryn or Kaetlyn would wake themselves up when they left home. And I can assure you that when they were 17, they knew how to use the washing machine... Or maybe its just that he is sweet and huggable and everyone's favourite brother...
As always The Asylum makes sure that their films grab your attention from the beginning so as expected there was a good amount of action right away. Including but not limited to, pirates taking over an oil tanker and demand ten million dollars and they have a bomb. Adrian Sinbad (Patrick Muldoon) the owner of the tanker jumps in a helicopter with a couple others and heads to his ship with the ransom money and a gun. His helicopter crashes and his tanker is taken down by a sea monster, but that’s the least of his problem. Sinbad along with other survivors including a pirate end up on an evil island and they’re all going to die, according to the pirate who they tied up. Poor pirate, the island is sinking (which isn’t an island) and he’s still got his hands tied , but don’t worry in the next scene he’s swimming with his hands free so I must of missed something.

After Tahiri's departure in '73 to join Jil Jilala, Paco joined the group, which remained a 5-piece until Boujemâa's untimely death in '74. This lineup is pictured above. Some of the classic songs of the group's repertoire date from this period but can be found only in re-recordings by the later quartet (or, worse, by the group after Paco's departure in '95 and/or Batma's death in '97). I have never once seen a release of the recordings of this quintet on cassette or CD.
Not only does Oliver add great interest to the story, but he is also the catalyst for change in Deanna. She not a very strong character, being kind of lonely and passive, and she knows it, but her concern for Oliver does, by the end of the book, force her to greater depths of personality. "Will Deanna and Oliver fall in love?" becomes a much more interesting question than the slightly MacGuffiny story of the watch.

I was disappointed in myself, but reading Exodus 33 today made me slightly less cross at myself. Moses had the Tent, where he went and spoke to GOD. GOD had led the Israelites out of Egypt, yet still, Moses asked for signs of GOD’s presence with them. Although I don’t think that this excuses my weakness in lacking the courage to admit that I see God in everyone, it helps to know that I am not alone in my weakness.

Austin Pendleton has done it all in his career of over 40 years. He's appeared in such films as Skidoo (1968), Catch-22 (1970), The Front Page (1974), The Muppet Movie (1979), Starting Over (1979), Mr. & Mrs. Bridge (1990), Home for the Holidays (1995), The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996), A Beautiful Mind (2001), and my personal favorite - 1972's What's Up, Doc?, in which his character, Frederick Larrabee, ends up with Madeline Kahn's Eunice Burns. Austin has also starred on many television series, including Love, American Style, Good Times, Homicide: Life on the Street, The West Wing, Oz, and two episodes of St. Elsewhere as Mr. Entertainment, a singing hospital janitor.

My surprise bonus lunch, however, threw up two issues as I trudged the snowy length of my street. Pretty quickly I realised that what was really required in wintry weather was something warm to eat. I was almost home when I also recalled that we were out of bread, which really is far and away the best stodge I have ever paired with paté. I had two choices: ditch the whole idea and put some leftovers in the microwave or think on my feet. Situational analysis, a military type might call it. There is a saying in our household inspired by Jack Reacher, the leading character in author Lee Child’s excellent range of thrillers. A former military investigator turned drifter, Reacher finds himself in situations that require accurate assessment of situations, and swift action. Usually involving the demise of a character on the wrong side of his faultless moral compass. “What would Jack do?” we ask ourselves when something arises that requires us to act.

Now, the casting.... You may find this hard to believe, but I think the biggest failing this film has is the fact that it has such a huge cast of talented comic actors in major roles. I guess one of the reasons that Airplane! did as well as it did is because of the unexpected appearances by Leslie Nielsen, Peter Graves and Robert Stack playing it straight with grave deliveries of laugh-out-loud lines. Things here are all loud deliveries of goofy lines and super-silly nonsense aplenty. Actors like Bologna, Channing, Mulligan, Kellerman, Dishy and Beatty are best-loved for being buffoons and all-around goofs. This is just another day at the office for these guys.
The author spends time looking at the resurrection of Christ since this is the theme of the chapter. Since Christ is only the firstfruits of the resurrection, this ensures that His people will also be resurrected. But when does the passage state that Christ’s people will be resurrected? This is at the coming of Christ in the future, so already there is a gap between the firstfruits and the next stage in the resurrection. Then comes the question of the millennial reign. Hiebert sets forth the principle of Christ’s reign including a series of conquests, of which death is the last in that series. Christ comes, He begins to reign, He destroys enemies including death, then comes the end when He delivers the kingdom up to the Father. This shows another stage to the resurrection at the end because this is set forth in just such terms along side the firstfruits and those that belong to Christ at His coming. Of all places to turn in the NT to support his claim, Hiebert goes to Hebrews 1-2. He shows how the author to the Hebrews and Paul in I Corinthians 15 both quote from Psalm 8 and Psalm 110. It’s a brilliant thought, although he is reiterating a work by Wilber Wallis. His point is that both passages are united that the reign of Christ is future, so positioning the reign of Christ now is dismantled by two different passages saying the same thing. The points he makes are short and sweet which is the style that I prefer reading. His ten pages of argumentation are better than most who write twenty pages in this same book.

The story of injustice against undocumented farm workers finds another connection to the plight of the foreigner in ancient Israel in the list of returned exiles found in Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7. The list ends with an account of three families of priests who “sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but it was not found there.”[13] As a result, these priests were deemed unclean and not allowed to serve. They were also denied their only source of provision – the holy food given as offerings by the people. Undocumented farm workers experience very similar treatment. All too often, their wages are stolen by their employers through a myriad of tricks and schemes. Like these “undocumented” priests, they are cast out from society and deprived of the dignity that comes from earning an honest pay. Interestingly, while the Israelite people rejected these families as priests, they had no difficulty accepting the labor of these families during the reconstruction of Jerusalem’s wall. Undocumented farm workers in the US share a similar fate: while nearly every US citizen relies on the work of undocumented people to fill their plates, few are willing to allow undocumented workers a fair share in the fruit of their labor.

If I have any complaint about the movie, it is that some parts are a little too predictable. Aside from that, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of comedic horror or the slasher flicks of the 1980′s. It is not overly gruesome, but has just enough to make the movie a fun one.

My reading experience is indelibly linked to cover art, edition, shape, size and weight of the books that line my shelves and occupy side tables. Some are old and instantly transport me to small, cramped little bookstores, where I found some of my most valued treasures.

Maybe Doona needed his Viagra email. Should I forward it somewhere? What will my friends think if I don’t respond? Oh My God!

So let's get the preliminaries out of the way: the setting is immensely better than I though it would be - the clear plastic used in much of the roofing keeps the main areas light and airy and the lights of the tall Christmas tree are visible through the roof as well, which adds a nice holiday touch. The tent is heated so it is very comfortable and you can find spots to linger in of varying temperatures to suit your preferences (closer to, or farther from, a tube emitting hot air). There is a lot of stuff inside the tent and it does get a little crowded, but the smell of cinnamon and spices is ever-present and in toto it is a very nice environment indeed.

LLS played a vital role in the research and development of these drugs.

I went to Walters to ride Fred. Keelah came too and we went off to jump some fences. Fred was being silly so I thought I'd just pop over a small spar to start with. That went really well so I started cantering across the paddock to the next jump, then for no real reason Fred reared up a few time then reared and bucked at the same time so all 4 feet were off the ground. I was thrown onto his neck and was lying horizontally across his neck then he spun round and I flipped off. Keelah said I flipped twice bit it didn't feel like it because it happened so fast. I landed on my back but I wasn't hurt so I hopped back on and we finished the ride like normal and he was really good for the rest of the ride :)
If we absorb the things we’re told, that gender, race etc don’t matter then you can’t help but be nonplussed that they seem to matter very much to the very people who are telling you that they don’t matter. The idea that we can draw new people into the hobby from under-represented sectors with a few bits of inclusive art is patronising and even insulting. It also creates a lot of pressure on creators to the point where they may end up making the ‘ethical’ choice over the best choice. The scare quotes are there around the word ethical because it rarely is anything at all to do with ethics.

I was twelve in 1971. T-Rex and Slade had their first number ones. I didn’t have a .22 rifle and, if memory serves me right, my bike was blue. I probably did fire my first air pistol back then; before that it was water pistols and spud guns. Looking back on the history of that time it wasn’t that grand. The UK’s economy was in decline: there were constant strikes, the three-day week, electricity blackouts. My dad was never out of work but times were tough. And yet I do look back on that time and regret its passing because there was a lot lost back then that I don’t see us getting back. What I’m saying is that I can relate to what Brautigan’s getting at in this book. It’s not just about a mistake that a boy makes that affects the rest of his life because we all have those. We know from page one pretty much what’s going to happen. Brautigan drip feeds us details but if you’ve read the blurb on the back you’ll already know.

Today’s college teacher needs to be a guide and a coach — not a judge. He must learn a new cognitive language when he steps into the classroom. He must muster up the energy to leap over the generation gap; possess behavior-modification strategies of other-directedness, empathy, patience; understand the students’ brains and accept that they operate differently than ours.
But with me having Tegel Manor on the mind a lot in the last few months, and possibly doing a sort of sequel to that great module for my OD&D games, I remember that unique soap opera from the 60’s called Dark Shadows.
I really don’t know how to change this - I have found this to be a universal feeling among step-parents I have met out here in the blogosphere, but no one with any good solutions yet. Other than maybe June Carter Cash who raised her children to believe that the only “steps” in the house were the ones you used to go up and down and did not extend to titles for people.
I really like to play with watercolors in my nature journal...it is a wonderful way to brighten up a rather ordinary idea for a journal page.
2) So I've had this shoulder problem for about a year now. It started with the left shoulder -- really intense, shooting, burning, CONSTANT pain, worst when I sleep. Now it's in the right one. Last year, I saw a chiropractor and a massage therapist for the left one and it did help, but not all that quickly. I had a 2-month lull with no pain and then it came back with a vengeance in the right shoulder about a week ago. We're talking, weeping-into-my-pillow pain. I know that's the third time I've used that pillow-weeping reference in the past week but I mean it literally this time. I was actually awake all night weeping into my pillow and wishing I could die, that's how badly it hurt. I decided to see a doctor on Monday, and she put me on Medrol, which is a steroid, and also gave me some muscle relaxers for when my shoulder decides to turn into a rock. Which it does sometimes.

I've been making this for just over 4 years now and it's been a hit every single time. Even the omnivores end up having seconds. Personally, I think that one of the keys to success with this is to have a really delicious gravy with it. My favorite for the past couple of years is the Punk Rock Chickpea Gravy from Vegan with a Vengeance. If you don't want to bother with making your own gravy, the Simply Organic Mushroom Sauce packets are quite good. You'll just want to make sure to buy 3-4 packets so you have enough for the entire roast. I'll put up a brown gravy recipe tomorrow if you want something that's more traditional.
For us (OK, for me), these are glory days, magic times when the schedule is soft and flexible. I can drink a little too much coffee, and talk to other mothers. Billy can be himself outside of the safety of home. Both of us can revel in the fact that he is, above all, an 8 year old boy on his long summer holidays.

It is of crucial importance to note that whenever reference is made to the Great Trek, it is always said that the "Boers" took part in the Great Trek. There was no "Afrikaner" Great Trek, and there were no "Afrikaner" Great Trek Leaders, just Boer Great Trek Leaders. This is an indication that at this stage already the Boers had developed an identify of their own, as distinct from the Cape Dutch and English settlers of the Cape.

This is a lot of work, and this year I decided to streamline the decorations and not put up so many trees. I will like to spend my holiday time enjoying the holidays with family, visiting friends,and making plans for the approaching new year.
The memory of Jessica’s face flashed through my mind when I’d met her last summer; honey-brown eyes and springy hair that always stuck up around her head with static, and her sweet smile, part baby teeth intermixed with adult teeth. She was such a sweet, innocent child. If she had survived this long, she could be dangerously close to death from cold. My heart battered against my chest wall, and I fought off the urge to start running, directionless, into the bush to
However, despite the pros and cons of re-making films, this is part and parcel of the world of celluloid, along with profitable franchises and a frequent formulaic approach to storytelling. But is there any other creative industry where a similar style would be just as easily accepted?
No time to dawdle...speeding from point A to point B - Here we go, pulling out of the station:
After waiting for a long time at Pendra Road Station, Gaurella, I caught a train to Jabalpur, 1st AC. That was a first for me and very nice. One of the co-passengers was a French Software Engineer, who came to India via trains. He had seen Khajuraho, Bandhavgarh Sanctuary (no tigers) and was on his way to see Sanchi. He had learnt Hindi consonants and did not know how to combine them with vowels, so I showed him. The highlight of this journey was that I saw the Sun literally sink into the horizon, a first time for me. Previously the horizon was obscured by mists (coastal areas) or by buildings (urban areas). I naturally got all excited by this. The MP tourism hotel in Jabalpur was called Kalchuri Residency and it was quite nice. Right outside you can get the best Poha in the world!

And there is my scared and worried little friend. There is a way in which we can prolong your magnificence and make you feel as if there is an actual point to the massive accident that was all of your atoms colliding and forming the slightly odd looking humanoid with the vacant look plastered all over its stupid face. We will invent religion, and in turn, heaven and hell, and make you believe that your wondrous existence will carry on for the rest of all eternity if it means that we can control you all by brainwashing you into believing in this new thing called “religion.”

I usually write a novel from either a third-person or first-person perspective. However, in The Butterfly Forest, I really want the reader to understand the point-of-view Luke Palmer felt after serving 40 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. The readers can see and feel the forest and the chain-of-events through his eyes. At the same time, Sean O'Brien is developing a strong relationship with Elizabeth Monroe. I want to give the reader a more intimate perspective into what's happening to O'Brien, especially as he tries to put his life together after the death of his wife.

And there were less glittering parts of his resume, an arrest once because of an investigation into domestic violence against a girlfriend with whom he was sharing a home in Oceanside, the woman saying that Seau had assaulted her during an argument. A few hours after that, he went down a seaside cliff in an SUV and survived.
A way to get around this is to download one - say Firefox, Chrome or Opera (note: you can't seem to run multiple instances of Firefox, the program doesn't seem to like it) - and install it to a folder buried in your computer. Don't put it under Program Files or /usr, have a good look under the computer's settings to find a place to stash it. Again, use a search engine to change the permissions on the folder you install it to. That will mean that only you can get into it and anyone wanting to break in will find it harder than usual.
The Oxford English Dictionary decided several years ago that the use of “they” and “their” in this sort of sentence structure was “acceptable” usage simply because it had been so commonly used for years by everyone. The alternative would be saying “he or she” and “his or hers” instead of “they” and “their” every time the circumstance cropped up and your tongue and brain would go potty after a time.
Next we dove into the local pizza joint, Bluegrass Pizza & Pub - which definitely had similarities to Louisville's own Wick's Pizza (which isn't my favorite because I'm a New York, thin slice-pizza kinda gal) - but Bluegrass was definitely spot-on with their traditional-style pizza and I would prefer them to Wick's any day. Sorry Wick's!

Add to this the social and political context of 1990s identity politics. If racial tensions in the 1980s could be described as bad, the early 1990s seemed awash in racial antipathy. The LA and Crown Heights Riots, the Clarence Thomas hearings (throw in a healthy dash of sexism too), the Amadou Diallo shooting (and others like it), Giuliani’s “broken windows” policy, and numerous other examples hinted at the racial troubles of America. Public debates about race and racism seemed shot through with tension no matter the intentions. Though rap and hip -hop had begun to course through the veins of white suburbanites, these public conflicts over race sometimes threatened to overwhelm this simultaneous cultural crossover. Even when one could identify with the struggles of black and brown Americans, to pretend that you were in the same boat economically and politically just didn’t seem right.

After the jumper rounds we had to go change tack and head back out immediately. We did two Eventing TOC Open. For those I rode Novice A 2010 and Novice B 2010. Then we did a training level dressage test. We did Training Level 1 2011. That was a fun test. That was the first time we competed in a big dressage arena. I actually didn't realize that the test would be in a big arena until we got there. What can I say? We are used to eventing tests in the small dressage arenas. I just didn't think of it. We have a big dressage arena at home but the letters have been moved closer to form the smaller one to practice our eventing tests in. I was like uh, oh...more letters, then I realized our letters for Training 1 are all the same for our eventing tests so I could just ignore the other letters.
Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy. Add the sugar and beat for another 3 minutes. Add the eggs one by one, and then the yolk, beating for 1 minute after each addition. Beat in the vanilla; don't be concerned if the mixture looks curdled. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk, adding the dry ingredients in 3 additions and the milk in 2 (begin and end with the dry ingredients); scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed and mix only until the ingredients disappear into the batter. Divide the batter evenly between the two pans and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula.

“The star we observed is so close to Polaris that we needed every available bit of Hubble’s resolution to see it,” said Smithsonian astronomer Nancy Evans (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics). The companion proved to be less than two-tenths of an arc second from Polaris — an incredibly tiny angle equivalent to the apparent diameter of a quarter located 19 miles away. At the system’s distance of 430 light years, that translates into a separation of about 2 billion miles.

I realize that not everyone is as fascinated by small animals as I am and many would turn their noses up at this species in particular whose common name is “flesh fly”, because they feed on rotting meat and give birth to larvae (not eggs) on it to give them a good start in life. On the other hand, they are very useful as they help tidy up the environment. But just consider the degree of miniaturization that goes into making this tiny body. We boast about our ever smaller electronic devices yet we are nowhere near making a “product” as tiny and yet as functional as this. What we swat without a second thought is an incredible marvel. The fly must have sensed that we meant no harm as we were able to come quite close to take our photos.
It was about a week before our fifth wedding anniversary last year - we were home - kids were napping. I thought we were waiting for an old friend to stop by for a quick visit (on his way through town for a work conference), but when there was a knock at the door, I didn't immediately recognize the person standing there. I also couldn't figure out why our "friend" would be driving a big van and carrying a large package to our door.

In 1965 a geologist names Richard Faas from Lafayette College in Easton, PA, took some of the rocks to his lab for testing. He found that when the rocks were stuck they created a series of tones at frequencies lower than the human ear can hear. He concluded that when the various tones of the rocks interact with each other, there is a sound high-pitched enough to be audible to the human ear. But, the specific physical mechanism in the rocks that rendered them able to make sounds could not be discovered. (Information from site of “The Unmuseum”)

Then we have collection (which is our group time). We often start of singing songs together. Right now we are going over some USA basics about the states and Presidents. We're learning the "50 States That Rhyme" song. We've managed to memorize about half the states so far--and we point to each state as we sing it. It's been a fun challenge, though I doubt we'll ever sing all 50 states in 35 seconds like the young girl on you tube here!! I typed out the lyrics last summer. You can download them here if you're interested. We are also learning a few basic facts about the US Presidents. We've covered the first five and we'll eventually go up through at least Abraham Lincoln. Our main unit in history this semester is on the American West. I'll be posting about some of the things we've been doing with that soon.
Besides Kevin Nelson's great book, I was greatly helped by Bill Staples, Jr. fellow SABR member and author of the book on Nisei baseball pioneer Kenichi Zenimura. When I wrote to Bill about the story I was thinking of writing but running into dead ends, he kindly pointed me in the right direction when it came to Kenso Nushida since he was a teammate of Zenimura and was included his book. Thanks again Bill!
This past weekend I went to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. For quite some time now I have been wanting to visit Grotto Falls, which is a short hike off the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail. When I got to the falls there were not many hikers there so I began looking for a good composition. Just as I find the composition for the photo above, down the trail come a bunch of people. They swarm like a bunch of locus all over, climbing the rocks, getting in the dream blocking my shot of the falls… You get the idea. Finally after waiting while they finished wading in the creek and the pool at the base of the falls, I had a 6 second window to take this shot before more people came up the trail and the situation played out again. In the end it was a brief visit but a productive one. I look forward to returning to this waterfall in the future and seeing what other compositions I can come up with.
Remember back in the day when folks actually used to give out homemade candies and goodies to trick-or-treaters? My sister and I would occasionally get a popcorn ball, or a small bag of chocolate chip cookies from the neighborhood old folks and we'd eat them just like the snack-sized candy bars that filled our plastic pumpkins. Then, the "razor blade in the candy bar" incident happened somewhere in America (who knows if it actually did happen or it was an urban legend) and moms everywhere recoiled in horror and suspicion over anything homemade at Halloween.
And then relief. And then pandemonium – a trickle of people on the pitch, followed by a flood. It’d be rude not to join in, wouldn’t it?

It wasn't like we could throw it away, this Saddest of Christmas Trees, so we walked back to the house with it slung over Sverre's shoulder. I had received all the Christmas ornaments my aunts and uncles had gifted me over the years from my mother in California. We crammed every single ornament we could on it, grabbed our coffees and leftover brioche, and settled back to look at our achievement. Our very first Christmas tree in Norway.

Even thought they are so large and have a great number of different brews, the quality is still. It is just on such a larger scale than the regional beer company's.

My Grandma Ann is a matriarch in the truest sense of the word. My mother's side of the family is large, given that she is one of ten children, each of whom have gone on to have many children of their own. Grandma Ann has been my lone grandparent for the greater part of my conscious life and is well known to be a fantastic cook. She taught her daughters how to bake, and all of them and their female children get together each winter and bake huge amounts of Christmas cookies. In this picture, I'm in the back with long hair and I have my arm around Grandma.

I really enjoyed Busan. Koreans have a noticeably different attitude than the Japanese. I’d say they act a bit more Western, actually. It was a refreshing break from the polite tranquility that I’ve grown accustomed to back in Japan. People weren’t afraid to push me out of the way to get by on the sidewalk, and no one stopped to stare or gape at the foreigners. I also wouldn’t ever pick a fight with a Korean girl – they looked like they’d be more than happy to kick your ass rather than be pushed around.
While all these examples did indeed constitute online communities, they may not quite fit the modern definition of social networking for a variety of reasons, including the limited number of social features and their integration into the communities. However, they did fulfill our three requirements for a social network: They enabled, encouraged, and facilitated User Generated Content; they were online communities; and although sharing opinions and ratings with others was not usually formalized, commenting was generally fully supported.

A wave travelling through water is not an object - it is a process. The water it flows through is affected by the energy of the wave, causing it to move up and down, but it doesn’t move along with the wave. If you place a rubber duck, for example, in the path of the wave, it is not swept along with it – it merely rises and falls as the energy wave passes under it. When the wave hits the beach, the water crashes and some of it surges up the sand or pebbles, only to retreat again once the energy has dissipated, not having actually travelled very far.
All I wanted to do was escape this horror show. I needed to find a properly lit bar to die in. Eating it to a k-pop soundtrack simply would not do.

I see kids daily who think they have no choice and act out of impulse when things get bad. Today’s kids have life happen to them and they react, instead of being an active part of their own life and accepting the consequences good or bad of their choices. This is a serious flaw that all parents and school administrators need to address. Childhood is a chance to grow and make mistakes in an atmosphere of safety and support. If we don’t expect them to fail and don’t allow it, then when they do later in life it is harder to learn from it; as the consequences are more severe.

If you’re writing a poem, make it about her not just about like “oh she has pretty eyes”, it’s like every girl has pretty eyes. If she loves Justin Bieber, if her name on Facebook is Christine Bieber, then take that girl to the Bieber concert and just shut up for the night about it. Do something for her. You’re gonna hate it but you’ll see how really happy she is and you’ll see the look on her face and you’ll be like “I did that, I’m pretty cool”.

- This recipe starts with a sponge of warm milk, flour, and yeast. My sponge was a bit stiff, so I probably should have added more liquid. It never bubbled but it did swell. After more than an hour, I added the other bread ingredients, mixing the dough first in the food processor and then finishing kneading it by hand. It was looking as though the dough would need some more liquid, but when I added the fat to the recipe - I melted the butter so it would be liquid - the dough was perfect in texture.

3. You need a ruthless occupying army, putting into practice that dreadful word called PACIFICATION, which is army (every army in the world) code word for rolling up your sleeves, going into a village and putting all the men (sometimes the women and children too) against the wall and shooting them; then burning the village to the ground. Rape of women and/or kids optional.

This is all pretty scary. Unless you’ve learned at some point to confront your fears, push your limits, and accept no excuses, this is all you know. Maybe this is all you choose to know. Our comfort-driven culture doesn’t seem to want to deal with anything that requires even the smallest amount of effort.

So why ink the edges of your card in the first place? Well, it can help to create definition; it will mask an imperfect edges and it can be a cheaper way of creating a matting and layering effect without using your precious and expensive paper.

Add some salt and pepper while they are cooking. Seasoning throughout means the flavors can develop while cooking and they won't be thrown in at the end. Yes -- it really does make a difference. This is also a good time to add the paprika. I said a dash because I wasn't intending to add it to the dish before I started cooking; however, while I was making it I decided to add it in. I sprinkled it into the pan and over the veggies, similar to how I would if I was adding salt. I wanted enough to be able to taste it, but not be too overwhelming. When the potatoes are cooked through, add the garlic and tomatoes and continue cooking until the garlic has turned golden. If I was to add an egg I would have done it now. Yummy in my tummy :0)
I can't wait for the next series, just can't get enough of the Cumberbatch!
As I get older it seems that things aren’t as entertaining as they used to be. I really don’t get much joy out of most methods of entertainment. I still enjoy music and I’ll occasionally listen to the radio (That makes me sound old considering I don’t own a car.) Radio gets really repetitive after a while. I should probably read more.
Please lovely people, use your time wisely! Now it’s so beautiful outside, I’m off to the park to do a metabolic circuit.
A gorgeous plant whether it is blooming or not. I personally love the purple "freckles" on it.

Plants on Hawaii have many different origins, some indigenous, others alien. Endemic plants are those species that evolved in isolation on the Hawaiian islands and are found nowhere else. Indigenous plants are those that colonized the island before the arrival of humans, such as those that arrive on the winds or over the ocean. Plants introduced by the first travelers to Hawaii, the Polynesians, are regarded as native. Most of these plants have important uses for food, fiber, medicine, and spiritual significance. Alien species are the plants introduced after the late 1700s since contact with European explorers. Some plants were brought purposely, many were accidental weed introductions. Many alien species are escaped cultivated plants and fruit trees, and many are causing damage to the native and less hardy Hawaiian plants.

I've been spinning again, since there is shuttle now and I don't have to walk two miles twice a day. This is the second bobbin and it's almost since I took this picture. It's the fiber my friend bought me for Christmas. One more bobbin then I will ply it. I'm anxious to see what the finished yarn will be like. Also, I have 8 oz of CMF Walpurgis in BFL that Duane bought me for Christmas. I'm dying to spin that.
Like so many Whites of modern North America, Thomas Jefferson makes reasonable deductions based on an abundance of study and observations on the undeniable and profound fact of the multitude of differences in the races, yet still wishes to imagine that it will all resolve itself in some egalitarian utopia at some unspecified future date under some mysterious bit of magical circumstance.

I completely understand that as I am affiliated elsewhere, I didn't expect to be able to participate in the democratic caucuses. But at least they welcomed me as an observer. I tried, on the state GOP's website, to verify the location of my precinct's meeting and it wouldn't even let me see the information without registering as a republican. Now, even with the recent redistricting, I already knew my precinct and where we were supposed to meet. But I knew immediately I wasn't even welcome as an observer in the GOP's meetings.

We should be purposeful in our politics, not just protective of our values. We should understand what the Bible teaches clearly and accurately, not just assume our Judeo-Christian values are inherent. We should be concerned with how our actions represent Christ to a world who has a low view of God and a negative view of the Church. We must take a stand for what is right, but not at the expense of making our position repulsive to our opposition. We should strive in every way to live at peace with all men, all nations, all creeds. We must consider our neighbor more highly than ourselves. There is a way to promote change which brings dissension, and there is a way to effect change that brings collaboration. Don’t confuse the two.
Then I hit the 26K mark. I was running downhill, giving my legs a well deserved break when I saw it, the biggest hill I have ever attempted to run. It kept going, and it was steep! I was about a quarter of the way up when I felt a pulling sensation in my left calf. But I fought through it, until my legs decided that was the end. They began to protest. I had cramps in both calves. I tried to push through this, but my legs were led. So I walked up the hill. The cramping began to subside about three quarters of the way up, I thought I would try to run again. One step and my legs protested. So I walked the rest of the way up.

For hair loss or baldness, patients may apply a paste made out of hot olive oil, one tablespoon of honey, one teaspoon of cinnamon powder. This should be applied before they take bath and keep it for approximately 15 minutes. After that they can wash it off with luke warm water.

Think about it… vacation plans, job opportunities in other states, crossing state borders for whatever reason places LGBT individuals and couples in jeopardy if individual States have not enacted laws for our equal rights. This alone makes our country unsafe for the LGBT community.

And so. Sessions blogged. New beginnings. Feels good. Thanks, dear clients, for trusting me with your special moments. And thanks, dear readers, for letting me put on the pro photographer hat once in a while on the blog-- it IS a part of my daily life, and it's high time I got back to including it in my journals here.

When he was five months old, Simba nearly died after eating slug pellets in the garden. A few months later, he went terribly lame. Despite his pedigree certificate, low hip score and none of his brothers or sisters having it, after expensive investigations, we found he was riddled with arthritis - hip dysplasia, both hips and elbow dysplasia, both elbows.
I am married. Of course, you might know this already from reading my profile. What might be more news to you is that I find it hard to remember my quality of life prior to marriage. Twenty-four years of my life went by before I was married and yet the part of life which I recall most easily is married life. Why? Because my wife is quality. Our life together is great – even when it’s stressful or strained. I think very highly of my wife and the immediacy and goodness of our life tends to outweigh the memories of life before marriage.

“Dear? Who in the Hell are you calling 'Dear'? I’m not your dear you condescending high school drop out now keep your thick mitts off of me and get back to work! Thank you very much.” Bernadette’s jaw unhinged hanging to her chin underneath a set of bulging shock filled eyes but mouthing off to the bus driver was seemingly no making the wheels of the bus turn any faster so Mattie rephrased her position as if clearing a cough of temporary senility from her throat, “Yes Dear, I am fine thank you.” She turned her withered fan toward

The people to whom John was speaking would have understood the word repent to mean “change your thinking” or “change your mind.” Why would we need to change our minds in order to get ready for the kingdom of heaven as John suggests? Have you ever booked a hotel based on a beautiful photo on a brochure only to show up and find a hotel resembling the photo only in the sense that it had a door and some rooms in it? It’s disappointing to say the least. When Jesus showed up announcing His kingdom, it was nothing like the brochure. The Messiah they were expecting would bring deliverance by overthrowing the political powers of the day and ending the Roman oppression. Instead they got a guy who avoided power plays and asked us to “turn the other cheek.”

On her way back to the coffee bar, Anne had been accosted by a man with no shirt on who "wanted to give her something." Turned out to be a free copy of E.L.James's bestselling erotic novel, Fifty Shades of Grey. That, unlike the man, has received enough coverage.

Norwich’s hopes of getting anything from the game were, however, short-lived as an inspired push for an equaliser ultimately ended in the visitors enhancing their lead over the Canaries.
"Hellooo!" Noel jauntily begins, assuming a level of excitement unbecoming. He reminds us there's "just over a day to go", so BBC4 are keeping the timing in some sort of curious order. Steely Dan have crept into the top 30 with Haitian Divorce and are duly noted by a photo that makes them look exactly like the sort of studio workmen they are. We note from the Kursaal Flyers picture that the bloke in the Panama seemingly always wears it - and the guitarist's garland, actually, and the singer seems to have a very rectangular, short at the base and top head. Then David Soul appears at 11 and we spy 1977 hovering in the distance. Speaking of which, Anarchy In The UK was at 38. It didn't get any further as EMI dropped them in the first week of January and withdrew all stock.
One puts together the motive afterwards: Barry wants to be re-elected, the Fed doesn’t want its banking system to melt down, and yes, the Aegean seabed is a geologist’s wet dream, and the US wants nice cosy bases there with the minimum of fuss. Most conspiracy theories are put together the other way round.
Barely ten minutes in and already her charms are seducing out details I’d usually reserve for late night chats with my best friend. But such an honest, direct question deserves an honest answer. I did fall in love in a dream once, and felt utterly dumped when I awoke. “Yeah! And you go through sorrow and loss afterwards, don’t you? I think it’s the same with the songs, but then something shows itself when you start playing and it’s a very liberating feeling.
From my late teens to my early twenties, I suffered from anxiety. By anxiety, I don’t mean lots of worries. I mean an anxiety disorder that manifested in really powerful symptoms. At my worst I was having four or five overwhelming panic attacks every afternoon.

Our French Dinner - was so lovely ! For the decor we found a gorgeous vintage wallpaper to line the tabletop. We wanted a more dramatic take on a french countryside evening. We added tall candlesticks, flowers from Saipua...vintage silverware...and voila !
I think maybe it’s because what I want to talk about is intensely embarrassing. More embarrassing is the fact that I have not been able to eradicate this problem on discovering it. Generally, that’s what happens.
My main goal is to get parents and their kids eating real food. Natural sweeteners. No refined flours. Healthy fats. This can obviously be a challenge, especially when everyone is constantly on the go. I appreciate the value of convenient snack items; on my Facebook page I often suggest deals on healthier packaged items such as natural applesauce pouches and organic dried fruit.
“Well, they do,” said Joe between laughs.
Giant fractured glass tripod, 2008 is the center of Arceneaux’s show. The piece is exactly what it says it is in its title – basically a window of broken glass sitting on a tripod, except that the window also contains a skeletal-like form that we know from another painting in the show is the “skeleton of an animal man, tortured soul.” On one side of the piece is a light high in the gallery which shines through the window to the other side, where a couple of shards of glass sit without much fanfare in the corner.
In all such instances, however, I've known what I wanted. I look for two or three things. Basta. That's also nicer on the sales assistant.

I love him too much not to try to change things...Now where to start??
It smelled like beer and tomato juice and dog pee. It was a really gross combo of smells.
His father was there, just behind him. The sun had begun to creep over the eastern ridge, casting golden light through the woods as it rose. He was standing with a massive oak tree to his left and a bramble of thorny, tangled bushes to his right. His bow was fully drawn, his index finger resting at the corner of his mouth. His eyes, not sighting along the arrow as most people thought it was done, were trained on his target.
This is what things look like around here lately. I'm in the process of moving the studio on Broadway back home, which means there is a lot of editing needing to be done. It's been so nice to have a separate space to work in and use as storage, and I'll miss that. On the other hand, I really work best from home, because I can pick up a job for 30 minutes here and there every day, instead of having to schedule a block of a few hours where I'll be away. As Eve grew older, and I took up my part time job at the school, finding those blocks of time became harder and harder. It didn't make sense to keep renting a space just for storage.
It was a useful sweater to knit, given my current frame of mind - the phrase dormant volcano comes to mind. Most of the time I enjoyed it, it was soothing, not much to think about. Other times it was so boring it was unreal, I had zero enthusiasm for knitting it whatsoever but am so tightly wodged in my little box of only having one project on the go at a time I wouldn't cast on something else instead. I once read someone describe meditation as being 'fucking stuck in misery', this definitely had its moments

A water softener works by using ion exchange to remove hardness. Hard water has more magnesium and calcium in it than soft water. It makes the simplest processes, such as washing difficult, as you will find it harder to get soap into a lather in hard water.

I confidently strut into the place, feeling very good about the way I look ( should have known something would go wrong – damn hubris *fist shake*). I walk up to the table and first go to hug the friend that has driven into town since I haven’t seen him in a while. When I step out from the hug one of my fabulous stiletto heels catches on the carpet. Every time I fall I experience a moment – an infinitesimal moment – where I realize what is about to happen and know that I am powerless to stop it.
In any case, the idea that the Sunday Times investigation, denounced by Fifa's "ethics committee" for sensationalism and twisting the facts has been forgotten because it happened more than 3 days before the bid is made is nonsense. Also worth remembering is the Mail on Sunday's truly unnecessary publication of an indiscreet conversation the then FA chairman had, which involved unprovable claims that the Russians had been bribing referees for the Spanish, who in return would vote for their bid for the 2018 cup. The Mail, strangely, came in for very little actual criticism from its rivals who instead focused on "rescuing" the bid. Dog doesn't always not eat dog in what used to be known as Fleet Street, but what is clear is that the right-wing press always bites the BBC, regardless of how it would never allow such concerns expressed in the Sun's editorial, even patriotic ones, to influence when and what they decide to publish.

Peter realized he had long since passed the point of simple vanity and was touching on narcissism as he looked at himself. He was a fifty-five year old man whose body looked better than most guys did in their thirties. He had not only kept his full head of hair from his youth but it was only now showing strands of grey significant enough to be seen.
Her District Superintendant canceled the meeting she had requested and all around her people were talking about her, but not to her. I don’t know how anything productive could come out of shunning this woman. When a person goes from possessing faith deep enough to proclaim it daily to being so convinced of the non-existence of God that she would publically proclaim it, there is a real need for some good old fashioned Christian love. Obviously there are some things going on in her life that have left her unable to feel the love of God and that alone is the reason why her District Superintendant (and dare I say, Bishop) should have at the least had a conversation with her. How could we just leave her cut off like that? It seems so cold. And so unloving.
I wonder, though, if this can be true, because Dove does include John Berryman in her anthology. I think it’s correct to include his work: to my mind, Berryman is the greatest American poet of his generation, greater than Lowell (in whose shadow he once stood), greater even than Bishop (in whose shadow he stands now). But if you’re looking for wince-inducing, culturally insensitive language, you’ll find it in Berryman’s Dream Songs, which make extensive use of a blackface minstrel show motif. I think it was right to include him in the anthology. But if Berryman’s in, why not Plath?
Exeter was recently voted the most “Cloned” town in England, but before the war it was beautiful, and though wartime bombing hit some excellent buildings they could have been rebuilt on the old plans - but the council had them replaced in the modern style. In 1940 German radio announced, “Exeter was a jewel. We have destroyed it.” They had not. It could easily have been rebuilt.

Why did He look to heaven and bless? For it should be believed concerning Him that He is from the Father, and that He is equal with the Father. His equality He shews when He does all things with power. That He is from the Father He shews by referring to Him whatsoever He does, and calling upon Him on all occasions.

What funny things have the kids in your life spouted off lately?
To help children manage their anxious thoughts and feelings there are a variety of strategies for teachers to employ. Teachers should be careful to not reinforce the maladaptive behaviors, but instead encourage positive ways to cope with stressful situations. After an unpredicted event or crisis a teacher should reestablish a sense of regularity and predictability. Often times participating in extracurricular or recreational activities helps students to release some of their fears. Empathizing with students and validating their feelings while reassuring them with positive and hopeful perspectives is helpful. Lastly, depending on the maturity of the students teachers should limit student exposure to detailed accounts of alarming current events that could create an anxious response.

Suze has the scotch fillet with truffle butter - we find the butter tastes more of mushroom than truffle. On a side note, although the use of sous vide does mean consistently tender meat, do others find a hollow trade off with texture? Sous vide often seems to involve a loss in toothsome chewiness that is half the carnivorous pleasure in eating meat.
Yes, I am glad he communicates. Yes, I'm glad he is strong willed.

Designers Marshall Watson and Wendy Monette created a beachy Hampton’s feel with this living space.

Rising early this morning, feeling a twinge of sadness for some reason, I decided to attempt to penetrate the haze in my mind and attend to something productive anyway. I shuffled off to the kitchen, barely able to see, and started the morning routine of filling the coffee pot. It struck me as I did so that I had done this so often now, it had become nearly automatic. Yet, it still requires my immediate attention and concentration, even though it is at a reasonably minimal level. Once the chamber had been filled with water, and the coffee in the filter had been placed in its holder, I pressed the button on the front and set the carafe on the hot plate below the dripping stream of coffee. Occasionally, the coffee would drip too slowly at first and be siphoned off its normal path causing havoc, but this morning it went well and I decided to consider it a good sign.

It is not a ‘filler’, ie something unnatural that bulks up the face and can result in a chipmunk-like appearance, and the results develop over months so it should not be noticeable that I have had something done. And it doesn’t give the ‘frozen’ effect of Botox.
And so I sit here in the gastronomic capital of the world, staring at my bowl of sunflower seeds (and I'm sorry, it doesn't matter how you dress them up or what seasoning you put on them or how many books you read about their health benefits, sunflower seeds are for birds, not humans).

The stamps are all from Hero Arts.
Working and living in a high-rise building typically means you’ll need to be prepared to protect yourself from lots of breaking glass, and it always means you’ll need to get yourself to the main floor of the building without an elevator. If you live in the building, make a personal escape plan and remain calm, as many others will be exiting the building via the stairwells as the same time. Your employer should have a plan prepared if you work in a high-rise, so be sure you know the plan. In either case, be prepared and willing to help those who may have difficulty navigating the stairways, such as
Let me tell you a secret, I’m just not a fan of hanging out over there because it is boring as hell. But sometimes I feel like we don’t spend nearly as much time with them as we do with my family. Even though my family is hours away and his is 30 minutes away. So I insisted and we were both bummed by the fact that they only grilled brats and we were stuck in front of the TV watching the Matrix. A far cry from an Easter dinner that we would have had at my Mom’s. The need to vomit was on the rise for me.

One of the toughest challenges of the working parent (at least for those of us with a traditional 9-5 type of gig) is the morning routine. Even if you don't have a goose. Unless you are wealthy enough to have a live in nanny, or lucky enough to have your mum come and take care of your kids every day, every morning is a marathon of breakfast making, lunchbox packing, hair brushing, child dressing, show and tell, or check for soccer club, or payment for school photo remembering, and leaving a dried cows ear (or worse) for the dog walker - to give the dog to prevent her chewing on the furniture while we are out).
I tried the spinach paperadelle with lamb meatballs in a zucchini and mint sauce with green garlic and a lovely soft cheese (I forgot the name, shame on me!).

For some inexplicable reason, I always assumed I hated beans. As a kid, they looked funny to me. And in my six-year-old brain, funny-looking food = bad food. It wasn’t until I grew up, sacked up, ate one and didn’t throw up, that they became a regular part of my diet. (Okay, hummus helped.)
"While by now everyone is aware of the suspension of implementation of the rules on ex parte appeals," writes Professor Wegner "what is not generally known is that David Boundy is the hero.

I started on the bottom part first, before I really knew where the piece was going as a whole. I knew it was going to be about 'palimpsest' and 'language', but beyond that, my idea had yet to gel. I was hoping that it would reveal itself as I proceeded. After scratching and scraping and rubbing paint into the surface, I cut the book cloth and ripped a big hunk of it off, then stuck part of an old piece into the hole (yes, 'hunk', 'hole', and 'stuck' are the correct technical terms). I glued things on, ripped things off, scraped, peeled, and transferred. I did lots of this for a long time, and can't really remember what came first, next, or before. It was very therapeutic!

His hair has started coming in and his body is gaining strength, but we have still been praying for Von's long-term health. His stunted growth was one of those things that we were willing to accept, but still we asked friends to pray.
I’ve now booked myself in to see my GP on Thursday who hopefully will be able to refer me to a specialist as soon as possible. I’ve got a horrible feeling that I will end up having to get rid of my marathon place because of this, but I wont make that decision until it’s been fully examined. To say I’m worried and upset about this doesn’t quite explain it.

When Mom was visiting last year, we dropped by the experimental farm and both really loved some of the ornamental grasses. I’ve got ornamental corn and pampas grass seeding upstairs (though I’m not sure how the grass is really doing… I may have to get another pouch of seeds to throw in when I plant outside). I’ve also picked up two other types of ornamental grass, so I’m well covered in that area!

I am thankful for my accomplishments. I got a sense of pride back that I had given away. For me that is a huge thing to show gratitude because it takes me one step more in the direction that I want to go–a lifetime of happiness and thankfulness because no matter how small, insignificant, or ordinary it is, my accomplishments are things that I worked for and am proud of. Thank God for that.
A timely reminder that even when you disagree, even strongly, on some issues there can be areas of common ground to work together. Anyway, this is a welcome step in the right direction.

The court contrasted this with the approach in the EPO, where the first instance proceedings are regarded as little more than ‘administrative', with much less room for the testing of evidence, no cross-examination, and no compulsory disclosure. Moreover, there is much more latitude for the admission of fresh material on appeal. (In this case, the TBA had permitted a further 700 pages of evidence from the patentee just three weeks before trial.)

The other option is to allow the whole span of the wing to be aggressively steep, but use other methods to reduce the pressure difference at the wing tip. Firstly teams such as BAR created a cut-out in the end plate ahead of the flap, this allowed some of the high pressure above the flap to bleed off outside the flap, negating the pressure difference and therefore the strength of the vortex. But this was a fairly blunt solution, so teams created the now-common louvers in the endplate.
I recently read an article that said our best solutions come from our unconscious. When we ‘let go’ of an issue or problem that is bothering us, it frees our subconscious mind to put its supercomputing powers to work. I have had plenty to take my mind off my writing angst.

Architectural blandness aside, I'm pleased to inform that the natives are a very colourful race; open, friendly, helpful and hospitable - in fact, they'll willingly give you their last-but-one pasty, providing it involves the exchanging of fresh blood. As I waited for the arrival of the bus to Home Park, I was approached by two rather jolly gentlemen proudly wearing their sporting colours. "GREEN ARMY WILL KILL CITY SCUM!" they shouted. I didn't bother to remind them of both sides' respective positions in the league table as it might have hampered their good spirits. Aviva's recent television adverts seem to be a winner with the natives; it puts them on the map. Unfortunately it's a map of a different planet. Even the bus driver - a comely wench with lots of blonde frizzy hair - enjoyed hollering local slogans such as "Geddon, ya Janner!" at every conceivable opportunity. How quaint.
I would not, for example, want to use a characters’ gender or sexuality in any way that just might be for a cheap laugh, or to encourage the audience to make fast assumptions about a character’s personality based on his or her sexuality. These are both choices I see television writers make all the time in my personal television watching and they frustrate me for a number of reasons. I’m something of a comedy nerd and I’ve been performing improvised comedy professionally through the Steel City Improv Theater (SCIT) in Pittsburgh’s North Side since last January. I’ve also been a life-long feminist and had been an improviser on an amateur level for years before I auditioned for the SCIT. During this time, it was often frustrating for me to try and do improv, which is a largely male-dominated field, because people, usually males, were consistently using heteronormative stereotypes to get laughs in scenes. This can put someone with alternate views on the subjects of gender and sex in very uncomfortable and demeaning positions, made worse because when they happen on stage you have to be a good scene partner and play along with whatever your partner identifies as true. But even if what was happening wasn’t offensive, on a smaller level it was just difficult to play with improvisers and try and explore relationships between two women or two men or anything in between in a way that wasn’t being pointed out as odd. In more cases than not, my fellow actors would often simply become confused and get lost in the scene, then feeling the need to justify their confusion by calling out a queer relationship that I had tried to set up and making it the point of the scene instead of simply one facet of characters in a scene. Joining the SCIT was eye-opening because I found that the people who were best at improv, whom I respected the most and who had the most experience and best credentials, were the ones who wouldn’t tolerate that sort of joking. I was validated knowing that the best improvers consider simplistic, stereotyping sex jokes to be inappropriate if not just too easy. It occurred to me that the SCITizens’ approach to improv should not have really impressed me the way that it did.
I have learned about myself through Dean and he through me. I have accepted less than flattering aspects of my personality because he accepted them so readily. I have grown as a person as I struggled to step into my own light while still being a wife and partner all the while finding encouragement in my husband’s words and embrace. It’s been a good marriage, something that I am proud of and continue to be awed by. My husband has told me over that years that I am the greatest evidence that he is loved by God.

He gave himself that nickname. Returning from World War II (where he had a B-29 bombardier over Tokyo), he got a job as an early morning DJ on a radio station in San Bernadino. Looking for an angle to make him stand out from the crowd, he constructed a hillbilly persona from his childhood days, when he grew up poor in Tennessee. "Tennessee Ernie" stuck, and he soon found himself recording singles.

Pondering the true culprits behind the knot that arose in my stomach whenever I considered The Number, a beautiful stroke of serendipity (aka Twitter) delivered to me “A Wrinkle in Time”–Beauty Myth author Naomi Wolf’s recent take on the aging myth. Wolf kicks it off with an anecdote about a guy her age–late 40s–who showed up at a party with a 20-something woman on his arm and, in so doing, became an object of not envy nor admiration, but of…pity. Zut alors! What’s this? And Wolf doesn’t stop there:

So here’s the deal. One of the main characters in my book is a Christian (fairly outspoken) and another becomes a Christian, but the primary character isn’t and doesn’t, and I like to think that, while the book may be sort of about crises of faith and culture, it’s a story. An exploration, not a diatribe, nor an attempt to foist my views on someone else–except to the extent that all writing is that, in a way. I find it frustrating that exploring that as honestly as I could at the time, even in the context of a children’s book, needs necessarily to be relegated to “religious” literature. If kids can read books about gossip girls and witches and zombies and vampires–well, let them, I guess, but are we trying to censor their exposure to more “traditional” (as pertains to Western culture historically) religious ideas until, say, they’re old enough to scorn it? It seems like a double standard.
Lyrically, she’s as good as ever, with her album kicking off with ‘GO!’ in which she reminds you that she’s never really left (she’s made her mark) and it sets the pace of this fast paced LP that leaves you wanting more every time. ‘This Isn’t Our Parade’ is my highlight of the album with it’s chilled out, fresh, breezy feel. Her own genre is quite crowd pleasing though. Her rapping skills are shown on the incredibly staccato, zany track ‘Look At These Hoes’ which is my least favourite but will easily be someone else’s favourite.

One reason may be Jewish involvement in communism, particularly in the USSR and Eastern Europe. This Jewish involvement is one of the themes of Yuri Slezkine's book The Jewish Century, a tour de force on the central role played by Jews in the 20th century.

For those who don't know his story, Raul has Epidermolysis Bullosa. He is 19 months old right now, and has lived his whole life in hospital isolation. Due to financial hardship, the hospitals are not able to purchase the supplies he needs, and so they isolate him to try to help prevent infection. Knowledge about EB is not common in the area where Raul lives, and they have been very open to learning. Children with EB are often called "butterfly babies" as their skin is as fragile as butterfly wings; they get blisters and wounds from pressure and friction. These blisters can occur on any membrane (skin, eyes, GI tract, etc.). Raul is currently refusing to eat more than one bottle per day, likely because of the extreme pain he is in. We give him infrequent Advil, but his pain is much greater than that can alleviate.

The farm was called Matariki. I didn’t know what it meant, so when we were in the children’s section of the Wellington library the following week, and I spotted a book by the same name I snapped it up and started to read. I discovered that Matariki is the name for the Maori New Year. The word has two literal translations - Tiny Eyes (stars) and Eyes of God. The celebration takes place in June, based around a cluster of seven stars, and focuses on the unique place in which we live and giving respect to the land we live on. With this new understanding I couldn’t think of a more fitting name for the cottage in the stars.

Above all else, it is important to avoid rich, heavy and high-fat foods within two hours of bed time, as they require a lot of work to digest, and may cause stomach trouble and heartburn. It is also wise to avoid drinking too many liquids, including water, juice, tea or other fluids, as this may result in frequent bathroom trips throughout the night. Caffeinated drinks, such as soda, coffee or caffeinated teas not only act as diuretics, but will also keep you stimulated and make falling asleep that much more difficult.

Perhaps showing your capability is the weakness of this world. “The House That Drips Blood on Alex” shows itself to be that blasted form of intentional-unintentional-hilarity, which ruins all of its so-bad-it’s-good value.

But the trailer also highlights a weary Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) who by the looks of things takes quite a pounding at the hands of Bane, who seems to have targeted Wayne for something. From what I know of the film (which is a lot, if I can pat myself on the back), Bane leads an attack on Gotham’s financial centers, and the movie touches on a lot of the ‘have and have not’ themes that have become hot topics during the recent economic upheaval and Occupy protests. It makes sense for Bane to attack Gotham’s richest man.
Scholastic Corporation (Nasdaq:SCHL) increased guidance to north of $3.40 per share from the previous range of $2.60 to $2.90. that s for the whole year folks.

In the press release the corporate communications mavens billed themselves as “ the global children’s publishing, education and media company” Blockbuster books such as “Hunger Games” are not guaranteed repeatable successes. Educational books and materials do have a steady cash flow as teachers and thoughtful parents buy learning materials which gives their students/children a leg up.

Tahrir Square (Midan Al-Tahrir), literally “liberation square”, has a long and somewhat unusual history as a significant yet unlikely site of protest. As architectural historian Nassar Rabbat notes, unlike other historical squares that have witnessed revolution, “Tahrir Square was not planned as a central square in the city: It grew out of the accumulation of leftover spaces that coalesced over time to form its huge trapezoidal contours”. Here, Rabbat touches on Tahrir Square’s most basic flaws as a city square. Tahrir Square is neither a true central gathering space for the city nor an ideal square due to its awkward physical layout. Nevertheless, the taking over of Tahrir Square has historical and symbolic significance, making it a powerful stage for the protesters of the 2011 Revolution.

Someone must have done this for me when I was a wee one. Being a mom has changed the way I view my own childhood. I watch in what subtle ways Rowan's personality unfolds. His flare for drama and laughter, hot temper quick to cool, a bit of a dark streak. Dare I say an undercurrent of joy? I see his mama and where she came from--maybe for the first time. I believe that, no matter how things turned out, some people loved me very much (and that they still do). Sometimes the obvious needs to be stated. Stating so gives it life, makes it something to feel thankful for, rather than doubt.

I relied on commentaries from Word Biblical Commentary series and the Bible Speaks Today series. I also found some great quotes from Eugene Peterson, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and Karl Barth. I made a few comments on the Greek text as well. There are 14 pages of notes for you to peruse. Be Blessed. jerry

Most of us, the one's who have dedicated our lives to walking in the way that pleases God, make decisions for our life based on how we feel God's leading. However, we learn very quickly that just because we are obedient to what God has told us doesn't mean that our obedience in that area will SEEMINGLY to us— turn out perfect or pleasant. Sometimes it seems that doing the right thing for the right reasons seems DISASTROUS. PAINFUL AND PAINFULLY HARD.

Hello my friends! Giovana here bringing you a new challenge for the month of May! This month is all about "Birthdays". We all have birthdays to celebrate and always need a card, or maybe you want to create a special project as a birthday present or scrapbook pictures from your birthday, you name it, the sky is the limit.
My dad ‘s family was dirt poor. He was orphaned at an early age and grew up without a father.Though he was a product of a third marriage and had three siblings, he also had half brothers and sisters which really did not matter even then. Grandma tried all sorts of jobs, so she can feed her kids. Dad once told me that they would have cooked rice and salt for their meals. He and his is youngest brother Pinong, whom he was really fond of, would add some water on the cooked rice, so it would have some taste. These were days when they were lucky. Some days were not. And my grandma could not help but shed a tear, while they were gathered together at the dinner table. That was enough for my aunt Afric and my dad ,who was the second eldest in his brood, to leave Lubao, and try his luck at Fort Stotsenburg. And true enough he did.

For me, it’s less about looking for an impetus to create than finding the strength to follow it through. It takes an enormous amount of work once the fire has caught to focus that flame and keep it burning. This is my job as a director and at times it’s beyond exhausting. To be clear, exhausting is when you are running on (and running low in) your own inner resources. Beyond exhausting is when you have to go outside yourself to find the necessary fuel to keep the project going. It’s at those moments that I think about the audience. Not just the one I hope will see the piece I’m working on, but audiences I have known and loved. The couple who along with their serene seeing-eye dog navigated the obstacle course of a dilapidated midtown theatre to come to a new play from Argentina; a Chinese immigrant over-the-moon from seeing a multi-ethnic cast do a western classic; a seemingly disinterested twelve year-old who, during a Broadway student-matinee, added his own line of dialogue “Again!” just to bolster Juror #8’s climactic “It’s eleven to one.” I want to be true to these people.

As for black Americans, it may very well be a good thing that many of them are migrating back to the South. It is painful for a Yankee to admit, but most, if not all, of the race-riots since 1965 have occurred in Northern (or Left Coast) cities. I am not aware of any Ork-hole like Anacostia or South-Central L.A. anywhere within the states of the Confederacy; it seems that Southern blacks are as much more conservative than their Northern counterparts as Southern whites are.
So, we have a more clear understanding of how Mitt feels, especially since his legislative record reflects what he says in this speech, leaving little doubt that this is his actual opinion. Perhaps there can now be a sane and measured conversation.

We do not need to choose between spirituality and religion, any more than we need to choose between aesthetics and art museums. While one may say, “I love aesthetics but hate museums,” such a statement misses the essential point that art museums were established in order to create an environment that fosters the aesthetic experience of beauty and passion. In the exact same way, religions are institutions designed to foster spiritual experiences so that we may live with more purpose, power, love and joy, for the benefit of all. Of course one does not need religion in order to be spiritual, but unless one is graced with a natural connection to Spirit and is in masterful control of ego, some form of routine practice is needed.

I have to disclaim that the last of the unexpected beery events was actually expected. On the way home, we stopped for dinner at the legendary pub, the Man of Kent Tavern, in Hoosick Falls, just inside the New York border. This place rates, in my mind, as one of the beeriest places in all of human civilization. The Tavern is eclectic to say the least. There's a fare amount of English pub fox-hounds-near-short-tailed-horses-ness, but there's also a crazy array of soccer jerseys, militaria, golf flags, beer paraphernalia—and anything else that could be held from a nail—dangling from the ceiling, like clothes drying in the breeze. It's almost amazing at the amount of things to look at. The Man of Kent exudes beer, it is nearly the perfect personification of what drinking beer is about. It's fun, it works at its own pace, its a little off center and it has amazing beer. The Man of Kent let me top off my day—a day spent with my wonderful wife—and nothing could have capped the day better that a crock of French onion soup, a grilled turkey and cheese sandwich and a pint of Fuller's London Pride—with a pint of Greene King's Abbot Ale for dessert.

okay so my sister was NOT thrilled that I was letting the dog close to her bundle of joy… She was not alright with me allowing her kid to touch the howler’s face and fur. But I am an asshole, and I firmly believe in getting babies used to dogs, and dogs getting used to babies. The howler loves kids – he’s drawn to them. He wants to be friends with them. He’s a very friendly, very curious and social dog. And honestly, he is my kid and I want my niece and him to be great friends.

The image of jealousy – whatever it might have been – was an image that provoked anger in the Lord. What were these people thinking at the time? Did they actually think the Lord could not see what it was they were doing? That is exactly what they thought. Because the Lord had “scraped” the land of the inhabitants in His wrath, surely the Lord did not see, at the very least, did not care what was going on in Jerusalem (8:12).In this they were mistaken. In this, that which they thought was relatively trivial, to this the Lord took great exception.

I fell in love with this city fast; the style and nature of the people, the buildings and just the general vibe of the city- stylish with a grungy edge. Plus the shopping, oh my the shopping, but shall get on to that later. We (I travelled with my highschool bestie B, you can read her travel blog here) were very blessed with the weather- apparently it was a very mild winter this year and thus we were treated with sunshine and only two rainy days during our entire trip. We stayed in a little apartment in Hammersmith, which was a short walk from the underground station, a Marks & Spencer and various bars and cafes. We spent a little under a week in London and here are some of the highlights:
Iridology is generally based on the concept of neural pathways between the body and the iris. Although iridologists may differ on the exact mechanism, most maintain that the iris reflects what is happening throughout the body via nerve conduction from all parts of the body to the eye.

...she referred, of course, not to the Victoria sandwich we often call sponge but to the true fatless sponge-cake, made with just flour, eggs and sugar. Raising powder was not available before the 1850s, so the lightness of a sponge had to come from the amount of air that could be beaten into the mixture. Fortunately, labour was cheap and uncomplaining.

“Ahh! Hindsight is but 20/20!” It is a phrase usually used with sarcasm in response to criticism of one’s decision, implying that the critic is unfairly judging the wisdom of the decision in light of information that was not available when the decision was made. How evident this concept is in politics and regulation! John Locke, an Englishman known as the Father of Liberalism, initial purveyor of empiricism, and widely regarded as the forerunner of modern economics understood the necessity to study unintended consequences in legislation and regulation. So did the French economic journalist Frederic Bastiat. In his famous essay “What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen,” Bastiat wrote:

“These people worked out a way to game the system,” McGinniss says of the Palin family. “I don’t blame them. They are just grifters who suddenly saw a chance at the main chance and they were clever enough and canny enough to take it.

Warren’s life was filled with music, being taught at an early age by his father, then attending New York Military Academy majoring in music. He was a trombonist with his brother’s band, Les Brown and the Band of Renown until he went into the Navy in World War II where he served for 3 years. Upon discharge, he entered the business end of music and joined Leeds Music in New York City. Because of his success as a “song plugger” finding hit songs for many artists and overseeing many educational projects for Leeds, he was transferred to California to open and head the Leeds Music office there. The company sold to MCA and Warren served as Vice President of MCA Music, Inc., later to become Universal Music, until his retirement in 1981. During his tenure, he found Strangers In the Night for Frank Sinatra, Girl from Ipanema for Antonio Carlos Jobin, and helped market in the USA the innovative music album Jesus Christ Super Star, Downtown by Petula Clark, and It’s Not Unusual by Tom Jones.

While it's quite obvious as to what Centinella's function is (provide security, throw the occasional dirty look in Sam's general direction, and cause the lesbians in the audience to soak their rough-and-tumble drawers), Spangle's duties are much more complex.

Since the highly valued contents sploshing around inside his loins must be ready to spew at any given moment, Spangle strips down to her camouflage bra and panties and dances erotically in order to maintain spermicidal integrity.

Worse, of those, only 20% again will read the first screen they see on the other side of the click.

This is one of the longest single book I have ever read with a huge part of history, Russian culture and really vast stage of events. No comparison with Mahabharata of course, but that story some other time. I did not read this book for a long time after purchasing it and the reason was very interesting. Each time I started reading it, I was getting confused with long and difficult Russian names of the characters within first few pages and I had to keep on going back and checking which person is doing what. This happened multiple times and I did not go beyond first few pages for many years.

Our troop's leader was a very strict, no nonsense Navy veteran, and he ran our troop like his private branch of the military. "Captain Queeg's" idea of an "outing" was for us to "volunteer" to clear brush from some church property in town, or to pick up litter along a steaming hot stretch of highway. The other troop would be taking a hike to Laurel Falls in the Smokies, and we'd be sweating our asses off clearing briars from a chigger infested hillside behind a local church.

Recently a march was held, a march that in itself is propaganda, for it uses the very patriotism of the people, the very great love we have for the armed forces and utilises it to augment support for the fictitious war on terror. Yet the sham marches wherein the country pays homage to the fallen are nothing more than that, as each and every coffin contains a son or daughter that died needlessly, they did not, and I must make this plain, die for their country, they may have fought under our countries flag which is laudable enough but they did not fight for this country. This country is not under military attack, no tanks deposited on beaches, no ships upon the horizon, nothing but relative peace as far a s the eye can see, yet our government sees fit to marshal our troops, ready them for battle and deploy them because another nation tells them to. So they die, part of a coalition sent into another’s country, what would you do, succumb, make merry or fight should you have the weapons, to the death, I lament the loss of our troops but again they did not and are not fighting for us, for this country but for the ambitions of the elite, our troops are being used, murdered by the elites in order to fulfil their plans.
Why do I do this to myself? Why do I keep going back to the parched dry well that is the Adam Sandler flexography for reviews? It is because sandler is the most bankable star in Hollywood. His last twelve films have grossed at least $100 million each. He has fans out threre. It is inexplicable to me, but there is obviously something people see in him. Credit where credit is due, Billy Madison is as close as I have come to appreciating Sandler’s brand of comedy.
Are the analytics stored permanently, exportable?
Use of social media for marketing is a fantastic way to garner attention for one’s company. When users of social media share reviews or other tidbits of information regarding a business, the business benefits even more. It’s important for a business to give its social media followers a reason to spread its message, as they won’t do it for free unless it’s really compelling. Contest and offers are ideal incentives for this purpose.

The Noyes Library is a charming one room library created to introduce the library experience to young children, ranging from babies to preschoolers. The library's books are divided into children friendly topics- such as "going to school," "sports and activities," "potty-training," etc. which help children and parents find books that best suite the child's interests and/or life stages. There are chairs and benches available for children to sit on as they read books, as well as hands-on toys available for free play. Children can enjoy playing with trains, cars, trucks and blocks on the train table, or playing with dolls and animal figures on their barn table. There are magnet boards with letters that children can use to acquaint themselves with the alphabet, and a table set aside for coloring.

I did a full mock-up first, so that I would know just how much fabric I needed and could work out any tiny kinks. The bodice is terribly forgiving, so not much changed there (I think I rounded the neckline slightly more on the final version). I did end up making a second pair of sleeves since the first didn't have enough sleeve head.
I looked up at the rearview mirror to see my son looking back at me.

He caught her arm to steady her as she came through; courtesy she didn’t need, but she wouldn’t fault him for it. Behind him, the door stood open, and a metallic glint from within reassured her the Stable Rods were still in place. She barrelled past and into the Hall, met Barrit's eyes. He flinched, glanced away.

The first ever Bill Brown’s 1-2-3 Slam in Toronto was a smashing success! A nice crowd filled seats at Waterfalls Restaurant in Kensington as seven brave souls were the first to take up Bill’s challenge. A robust first round was followed by a captivating feature performance from Vancouver based poet-musician Brendan McLeod, who took us on a lyrical journey full of twists, turns and mild sexual innuendo.

When asked what type of man she likes, Nakagawa revealed, “Likes cats, macho, and doesn’t get angry when I watch anime.” She also shared her favorite anime character type saying, “Anyone is fine, as long as he has long, blonde hair. Also, I want a person who is wrapped in a bandage with scars.”

Since I got home I've been revising, revising, and revising. Also, Brooklin Youth Corps starts Monday and the garden needed attention. Also, I've been revising. Two days ago I plugged a massive plot hole, and was feeling very cocky about it until yesterday morning, when I discovered that filling the plot hole had created a plot chasm. Today I wiped out three days of theorizing and started over. I think I've got it this time. Or, anyway, I think that until tomorrow morning.
Whose idea was it to start the car up whilst it was in gear? Accounts vary. But let’s just say, for argument’s sake that it was RedBellyButtonBoy in case my parents are reading. This close to going in the Channel, we were. THIS close.
Republican anti-tax chieftain Grover Norquist has apparently said that Romney, if elected President, will not drive the country’s tax policy. He’ll simply sign bills generated by a Republican Congress led by Paul Ryan.
Some tips: I think next time i’ll omit the baking powder, I don’t know that it brought anything to the table. But i could be wrong and i’ll know after the next batch. If I do sesame again, i’ll also add in a tsp of sesame oil to enhance the sesame flavor (it is a very strong flavor so a little goes a long way). My crackers were very crumbly but that could have been because I used whole wheat pastry flour as opposed to regular flour since that’s what i had on hand.
The risk of what are called autosomal recessive disorders such as cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy is 18 times higher and the risk of death due to malformations is 10 times higher. Other negative consequences of inbreeding include a 100 percent increase in the risk of stillbirths and a 50% increase in the possibility that a child will die during labor.
And once again, you might think it’s not fair for this to be on two lists, but DEAL WITH IT. QFG3 is a great adventure game full of clever puzzles that, again, change or are slightly modified depending on your class, abilities, etc. And again, same deal with the characters and interactions. There really isn’t much more to say above what I’ve already said as this is one of the weaker ones of the series, however, it should be noted that it’s the first VGA one, meaning it also has the new interface and an improved battle system.

That scenario isn’t likely to happen, though (which is just as well, as the drive to Indy would probably be really boring). The Citadel has only won two games in the conference tourney once in its history. It’s hard to conceive of it actually winning three times in one weekend.

Speaking of bad guys, the ones in this book are seriously dark and sly. I particularly enjoyed reading the action scenes in this story, I could picture them so vividly and it’s a good job I can handle a bit of blood and gore as there is plenty of that involved.

Why not with a fantasy book where an honest man can bring down a tyrant, an evil dragon can be turned to good, good and Light can triumph over evil and Dark? Shea uses the Sword to defeat the Warlock Lord, Alias discovers she’s as human as a born being, Esmay discovers the strength to rally a crew in mtiny and win a battle, Mahree becomes a beacon for peace in an intergalactic misunderstanding (In order: Terry Brooks’ Sword of Shannara, Kate Novak’s Forgotten Realms – Azure Bonds, Elizabeth Moon’s Once a Hero, & A. C. Crispin’s Starbridge). Each of those characters decided they’d had enough of their situations and if no one else was going to do something to fix it, then they were going to suck it up and do it themselves. “It starts with me.”
He admits himself that he brought unwelcome attention to himself by “meddling in affairs too deep for a poor poet, by which I had provoked enmity of powerful men with who I could not contend, failing to realize they were jackals, not lions, that they would not be satisfied until they had severed my head from my body.”

Basically, you make or buy a pastry case, fill it with fruit, make a sugary sponge topping to pour over and bake. On this occasion I used a pack of ready-rolled pastry that I found in the freezer. It was ok but it is better with home-made, I think. In any case, it was lovely and very quick and easy to make, most of the preparation time being in the preparation of the fruit.

Jean Marie is almost seven years old. She came here nearly a year ago after her parents abandoned her to the care of an aunt who had no interest in raising her. Marie, who prefers to be called Jean, is shy, withdrawn, and distrustful of most adults she encounters. There are reports she may have been sexually molested by her uncle … Despite her withdrawn nature she smiles easily, and enjoys the company of other children. After receiving LSD on three occasions earlier this month, Marie ceased smiling at all and lost any interest in others her age … In the past week, she seems to have become easily agitated and has lost any interest in reading, something she seemed to very much enjoy before treatment.
This morning was forecast to be heavy rain so it was a lovely surprise to see a stunning morning on the Swan River for the official opening to the Rowing season at Blossom's school.
These few spears so are growing so big and tall – they’re way over 6ft already. Lucky it is next to a fence so it doesn’t get in the way too much. Last year they were still pretty droopy ferns but as they’re getting thicker, they’re standing up more.

Okay, here it goes...take your imagination and back track to July 15th, I believe. Susan, (one of my longest friendships) arrived in Las Vegas late afternoon to visit and be the official driver (she drives school bus in NYC) of our RV trip to the Land of Georgia O'Keefe.
So as my car idles in that traffic jam, I wonder how those two Amish women might handle this exasperating situation, I know, I know; they wouldn’t be in a car, they would be in a buggy. I mean the yielding part, the interior repose that works to align itself with the mind of Christ.

Stowers argues that “Paul was fully implicated in the values and discourse of his society, time and social group.” Paul didn’t parrot those values, Stowers says. In fact, he upended them in certain, vitally important ways. But he and his audience shared a common set of assumptions and a common vocabulary as first-century residents of the Roman Empire that we do not and cannot share as residents of 21st century America.
Doesn’t it feel great to finish something?
High school friends Enid and Rebecca are two alienated and very opinionated girls, who know exactly what they don't like -- of course, like most teens, they are less sure what they do like, as the realisation of a directionless future hits them (ring any bells?!). The girls live in an un-named town, but you almost certainly live in it too (or at least very near it)… All the life has been sucked out, and all the character buildings, and things that used to personalise it and make it unique are being torn down, replaced with cinema complexes, theme diners and shopping malls. The girls seem to despair at the loss of their towns identity, and to me, this suggests where the stories title comes from - although Clowes has never really explained it, saying only that he once saw some graffiti on a wall containing the words. Enid and Rebecca’s dream had always been to quit school and achieve adulthood, yet when it finally comes, it slowly tears their friendship apart. The ending is left up to the reader to decide, but many believe there are enough signs in the last few pages to show that Enid commits suicide… I however like to go for the thought that Enid has gone in search of a new town that still has its soul.

The New Jersey 5% Nation of Gods & Earths group, The Poor Righteous Teachers used the Seal of the United States as their cover of their "New World Order" Album. For people in the Islamic Tradition, Black Consciousness and Pan African movements the All Seeing Eye is well known. The Kemetic/Egyptian Eye of Ra or Horus, and its use within the Free Masonic Fraternity, has been much discussed. For The Nuwabian Nation of Moors and its founder Dr. Malachi Z. York it was the Black Man's eye of Kemet, stolen to make him blind, in some Islamic schools of thought it represents the Eye of the Dajjal or "The False Prophet", Shayṭān - The Anti-Christ.

Before long the regular cast began filtering onto the set -- Michel Denisot, Ariane Massenet, Jean-Michel Aphatie. My initial impression was: wow, they seem so much smaller than on the TV screen. Not shorter necessarily, but overall, slighter in stature. I realized how TV screens distort images. Then the announcement: "Deux minutes!" Make-up artists hovered around the hosts with finishing touches of face powder and hairspray. "Dix secondes! Cinq secondes. Quatre, trois, deux..."

I seem to fall for guys that either seem broken and need fixing, or guys that are down right lost. The men that have loved me right, are men that I couldn’t fall in love with. It’s as if I have had a permanent chip detonating within me every time someone who isn’t right, shows up.

Adults who consume one or two drinks each day can reduce their overall risk of developing heart disease by 30 to 50 percent, according to the American Heart Association. (One serving of alcohol equals 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine, or one and a half ounces of 80-proof spirits.)
For much of the winter, the winds here have been fierce and seemingly ever-present. When it's really raging, the wind makes a nearly constant droning sound as it courses through the tops of the trees behind the house. For days that sound reminded me of something I couldn't quite put my finger on--something metal and unnatural. Then it hit me--it's like that hollow sound made a marble circling the bottom of a cylinder or metal garbage can. It's an unnerving sound, and yet exciting in that shivery way, too. It makes me want to bustle around the house, making things cozy. My grandmother's old expression forms in my head: "Time to get cracking."
So Fonda reads, his eyes hidden by the brim of Morgan's hat. It's one of the finest scenes of Fonda's career, but Morgan is in the foreground, with only the top of his head and his eyes in the frame. He doesn't move, his expression doesn't seem to shift at all, and yet he is changing before our eyes.

If you are one of the three people who did not submit a self-assessment, that email will explain how your quarterly average was determined; in that case, you will need to speak to me individually to determine our next steps. It may be that you failed to share your Google Docs work correctly. Since we have been using Google for half the year, that is an unacceptable lapse; it may, however, give you recourse to request a grade change.

You'll note that this list does NOT include a sewing machine or a needle and thread. Again, this is sheer sewing-aversion on my part. My bag is sew-free. Yours doesn't have to be. Just substitute "neatly sew a lovely hem" for "glue the shit out of it" and you're good to go. ;)

Anyway, Crying Prince spends all night missing Park Ha and playing with sparklers and the next morning when his fated one returns home, he’s livid. Judging from the fact that he looks like death when she finds him sitting outside the house, I’m guessing the dude didn’t even sleep. LOL. He’s hilarious. Anyway, as one would expect, he yells at her for not answering her phone and being somewhere that he couldn’t find her. He demands to know if she wants him to die from worry. Basically, he keeps yelling at her in different ways, saying his heart wanted to explode, he felt suffocated, he felt horrible not seeing her, words that all say ‘I like you’ till he settles on the words themselves and confesses his feelings to her.

A quote to analyze: Stefan to Alaric: ”No matter what I go through to get her back: fighting my blood lust, trying to gain control of my life again. None of that matters if she has feelings for somebody else.” Do you think Elena has to dip a toe in the Damon pool and have it not work before she can really let it go? And thank goodness she didn’t sleep with Damon: Would Stefan have been able to handle it? Definitely not without breaking my heart.
Well, I have stories to tell and the like. 2 friends and I travelled from Rome to Florence, then Pisa for a day (it makes a nice day trip ^_^) and then from Florence to Venice (we were there for Easter, and I got to go to mass at St. Marc´s Cathedral.. oh yea, and for Palm Sunday I got to see the Pope, along with 2 Brazilians that I met at our hostel. hehehe). From Venice we flew to Paris. It was amazing. I loved all the cities, although I am now pretty much broke, it was definitely worth it.
Police officers shot and killed eight individuals last year compared to 93 in 1971. Another 16 were shot and wounded last year, compared to 221 in 1971. This, despite the fact there were five thousand fewer officers then, or approximately 30,000 in 1971, compared to 34,700 today. Officers were armed with six-shot revolvers then, compared to 16-round capacity semiautomatic pistols today. I find this particularly noteworthy:

Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and coriander, cook until foamy and fragrant. Add carrots and cook in the butter mixture until they are beginning to soften. Add stock and 2 big pinches of salt. Simmer until carrots are cooked through, 20-30 minutes. Remove from heat and purée with hand blender - I like to leave some chunks but you can do this to whatever consistency you prefer. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Mix chopped coriander into soup, leaving some aside for garnish. Serve with a spoonful of greek yogurt or crème fraîche and the reserved coriander.

Senator James Inhofe deserves a well-earned round of applause for his latest press release. All the GOP has to do this election cycle is keep bringing up Obama's record (or non-substantial record) over and over and they should win easily. They don't need to get into grubby political fights with the Dems because the Dems will beat them using that tact, backed up by their puppy dog MSM. No, just keep pointing out Obamby's dismal record and show him to be the empty suit that he is. Obama has managed to almost destroy and demoralise the entire USA and four more years will be the death knoll.

The principal features of the twin Rouanet Infant and Junior schools are the curved, art deco style facade of the infant school, the large layered chimney that sprouts up behind this and the intricate brickwork design along the majority of the walls. It is this brickwork though which is the most striking and unusual, with the large three-story street facing walls being covered in a diamond criss-cross pattern. If this pattern seems familiar, it is because it is seemingly based on a medieval design known as the Diapper style. Traditionally, as can be seen on Henry VIII’s Hampton Court Palace, this design was created using different coloured bricks, but the twist on this school building is that the effect is three-dimensional, with the diamond forms jutting out from the flat wall.
I'm proud of their hard work (and somewhere between relieved and self-congratulatory that I supported them in their efforts as it's never clear exactly what they will be tested on).
