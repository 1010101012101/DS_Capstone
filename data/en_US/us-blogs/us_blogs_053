The pairing was a harmony of both, neither overpowering the other. The bright flavor of the beer cut through the earthiness of the cheese. It subdued both of the more intense flavors and let through more subtle counterparts.
A rain barrel. I can not say enough for water storage. We have lost our water several times due to power outages. Water from the rain barrel can flush a toilet, it can be used for washing.

I've been using spelling "boxes" as the format for my spelling tests this year. You know- the boxes where there are tall boxes for letters like d and b and long boxes for things like g and y. It has greatly helped my visual learners and has helped my kiddos so much.
You all know how much I adore my pups. I'm kinda obsessed...and I'm not about to apologize. Life has been even more dog-centric than usual. Both my parents and I have applications in with a rescue group to adopt new dogs. Please keep your fingers (or paws for my awesome dog blog folks) crossed for us!
After the photos were finished, we high-tailed it out of that madhouse and went out to eat at Texas Roadhouse. Anna had a few more melt-downs in the restaurant which always makes for a pleasant dining experience, but she finally got herself together and defeated the hangry disorder.
I still have in my heart, mom, the tears you cried with me both silently and aloud.
I look down and I am her, made of mud and water, air drying in soft caress upon my heart and the sun warming my smile into realization. I have become the gift at the end of creativity, for I am the composition of life's cycles. I am her.
Interestingly alongside the usual pouring to avoid sediment advice it advises you to 'not refrigerate for longer than 30 minutes as a chill haze may result'.
I'm curious to find out how it's being received among domestic drinkers, so I'll ask around next time I get a chance.
The polishes above are all MNY. I had a hard choice making my decision though as the MNY displays don't ring my bell. At all. While the illustrations are cute in a Nylon type of way, the arrangement of colors makes me think of crayons at a daycare center.
If you accept nominations, I would like to nominate beers from the Summit Brewing Co. of Minneapolis.The Chairman of the Board is as Catholic, and as Pro-Life going back many years, as they come (well, he is a convert) and their beers are well rated in secular contests.
I did get to sleep in on Sunday, which was good. CPT held down the fort. But then, Jake convniced the little kids to swipe my key, and break into the electronics closet and steal DS's. I was SO mad when I woke up. So I spent the morning with angry tears. Which, of course, lead to a migraine. And being late to church. Sigh.
Through the years, Mike has kind of moved through what he wanted to do. He's been a barista, a roaster and most recently, he was a brand manager, babysitting 30-40 employees. But, "I wasn't living a lifestyle that was sustainable to my life and family." Mike likes learning and says he is really good at finding a new hobby and totally investing in it for a couple of months, like woodworking. He also plays the drums and enjoys spending time with his wife, which may be evident since the two have a little bun warming in the oven.
These key proteins produce subtle responses to the brains activity levels to regulate the amount of information transmitted by kainate receptors – responsible for communication between nerve cells and whose activation can lead to epileptic seizures and nerve cell death.
The “Predators Love Polite Kids” piece I’ve linked to assumes that when we are teaching our children to generally be polite we are also turning a deaf ear to any of their pointed protests or hesitations. But we aren’t. It also assumes we are squelching all their instincts. But most of us grew up with that, “Don’t kiss me with your lipstick-y mouth!” instinct and it seems to be one that we could suspend temporarily, for the sake of good manners, even while retaining our other, self-protective instincts. And even while retaining an open line of communication with our parents.
My owner, the Asian lady, rushes at Kim and lifts me up and then---KABLOOEY!--I splatter all over Kim Kardashian. A lot of me gets on her very classy looking coat and a little bit of me ends up on her blue shirt (it's very soft and nice). Some of me gets on her face, even. And I'd like to report to you that Kim's face is exquisite, but the truth is it's so covered in make-up that it's hard to tell.
Even looking at the photos from our trip makes me want to bust out my Scarlett O'Hara accent.

Another friend of mine is doing no-sugar, refined foods, bread, or red meat. Another is doing no sugar, meat, or bread. Another, no shopping. And there are several more variations.
There is a “three-layer” design of licenses according to the Creative Commons website. The first layer is described as “legal code” which constitutes the license and provides the formal legal language for lawyers. The second layer is described as “commons deed” which is “human readable” in that it summarizes the legal code into a reference guide primarily for people who are not lawyers—or people who cannot understand the legal jargon in the contract. The third layer is described as a “machine readable” version of the legal code in which search engines and other kinds of technologies can easily understand what is stated in the license. “Taken together, these three layers of licenses ensure that the spectrum of rights isn’t just a legal concept. It’s something that the creators of works can understand, their users can understand, and even the Web itself can understand,” (Creative Commons).
"She's an impulse buyer. She sees a vase, a tea set, an embroidered pillow and simply has to have it. When she gets home, she feels guilty for splurging on something she didn't need, so she skips lunch for a week to pay herself back. Basically, she never eats lunch."
Morning Everyone,
The Doctor and Jamie were taken to Victorian England where the Daleks drafted in the Doctor to distill the human factor in a bid to turn themselves into super-beings. We returned to Skaro and met the Emperor Dalek. The Daleks were defeated for good(?) and the Doctor gained a new companion, Victorian, Victoria Waterfield.
The class got me thinking back to my freshman year at Biola. I was, for lack of a better term, FOB (or Fresh Off the Boat), although I wasn’t entirely oblivious to American culture, I didn’t have a funky foreign accent or looked like I was straight from a Hello Kitty magazine, walk barefoot or wear clothes decades old. I thought I would be able to blend in with American society, but it was in the subtleties that I was most confused.
I went to visit Pierre in France this week and was finally reunited with a sewing machine. I've been wanting to make some coin purses using plastic bag fabric ever since Olly from Wollies commissioned me to make her one last summer. I decided it was the perfect time to make some more.

Next morning, Seung Yeon runs into Hyun Suk but passes by with a lifeless type bow and he’s left staring after her, wondering what’s wrong. In his office, he finds the video and sees the tape. It’s of the M2 members performing on stage in the department store. Woo Hyun is at a photo shoot and is told to imagine being kissed by the person he likes and inadvertently thinks back to the two kisses he shared with Seung Yeon and ends up with a big smile. But then catches himself and realizes what he’s doing, resulting in a frown and a big scowl. He’s given a break and his manager tells him everyone’s worried he’s not feeling well.
Make sure you check out what's in season before you go but don't be bound by a list. I had no intention of buying a lettuce on my last visit but when I saw the hydroponic range of lettuces at a particular stall, I just couldn't resist. One lettuce was only $1.50 and it was HUGE and crisp and fresh. I just quickly thought about my menu plan for the week and that's when I came up with the Salad Rice Paper Roll idea. For more information of what's in season, check out these web sites for your area:

So, Marlene won, and I feel quite certain that this lady’s political ascent has only begun. Keep an eye on the Coudray folks, from troublesome mayor, to troublesome COP member, too…follow where I going with this…keep an eye on it. I still find it hard to understand how after joining the party a week away from its internal elections Marlene managed to drum up over 7000 votes….are we saying that UNC members vote for slates and not for the policies and values that the individual stands for?
I guess I’d take some of that money and toss it at the Halloween party Grace and I are tossing. We dig throwing parties and they are generally well-received, so why not toss down a handful of hundy-sticks to make things really bad-ass, right?!
There is definitely more to say and many more layers of life to describe. But I also remember that everyone is busy. So I will end my narrative here with the following two thoughts.

Since the fillings he placed in her teeth kept falling out, I asked if he would place the crowns for free. He refused, and acted as if the missing fillings were my fault. He kept asking if I fed her gummy foods. Umm...no. She eats like a normal person, fuckface.
I pulled some card stock from my stash, as it worked better with my photos. I also added the blue striped paper from the Summer Star kit from this past summer. I love when you can mix kits. The airplane border strip couldn't have been anymore perfect!!! I love the little word stickers on the element sheet of stickers. I punched a hole and added floss from one of Jessica's past kits as well. I like the little bit of added texture. The smash tab.. oh what a great piece for these pics as well. My sweet boy really does inspire me. I tell you, this kit was just made for me, it feels like anyway. :)

As cross examination progressed, Mr Sheridan asked a series of questions about the size of News International, and Mr Bird confirmed they owned the Sun, the News of the World, the London Times and the Sunday Times as well as a “fair chunk” of Sky TV. Mr Sheridan put it to Mr Bird that the group was “powerful” and that one of its ex-editors, Mr Coulson, was (at the time) the Government’s head of communications. Mr Bird agreed the group was powerful, but said it always also did its best to be truthful.

Nothing to Envy--Ordinary Lives in North Korea by Barbara Demick tells the true story of six people who lived in North Korea in the late 90s (if you call this living). What an eye-opening account to me of what life is like there. For example, ". . . dogs in China ate better than doctors in North Korea." (p. 220) I can't say enough good things about this book! I really got a sense of what these people went through day to day and will never forget it! If you read this, it will certainly make you glad you live in the USA! It's fantastic!
The proofing stage… Once the script is done, I’ll have to proof it. Okay, I kind of like proofing, cuz I get to use a red pen. I like using my red pens and changing things. So yes, that stage I kind of like. Plus, I don’t have to carry my computer around because I’ve printed the thing out (Yes, I waste paper. Suck on that.)
Sometimes a particular work day calls for full protective gear just to survive the adrenalin rush from crisis situations. Other days, it’s enough to float the current with an occasional stroke to keep you on course. However, get the resources backwards for current conditions, and things get rocky in a hurry.
It’s hard to actually put these things into words because this personal stuff and we make ourselves vulnerable when we talk about them. And yet we can’t process and learn without the words, which is why we blog and comment on each other’s blogs. It’s not rude to ask a question, but I appreciate the respect.

Of course, as a nation, the Britons are well known for their distaste of any kind of weather whatsoever. Hot outside? Wander around complaining that it’s “too hot”, that it’s “sticky”, that you “wish there was more shade” or crack some lame joke about global warming. Raining? Mutter about it being “nice weather for ducks” (even though ducks don’t like rain), be unbearably smug about the waterproofs you might be wearing or look thoroughly miserable as you get completely drenched. Grey and miserable? Bemoan the fact that there’s never any “interesting” weather, huff and sigh to yourself or simply gaze into the middle distance. Snowing? God help the country as it grinds to a complete halt.
“Whatever,” I retort. You know we have to date at least twice a month unless we are in a monogamous relationship. Will was single, so he had to ask someone.” I know she’s right, about the judgmental part. I can’t help it, though. If I think it, I say it, and this does not bode well on the dating front.
It feels like every day we’re on the brink of a fight.

The truth is, I really don’t like this chore—whether it’s at the beginning or end of the, uh, race. I like to cook, I love to eat, but making food for children that must fit in small containers and be consumed in five minutes or less while squeezed in a stinky gym (child #2) or eaten walking to the convenience store (child #1), is not something I relish.

I wish I could tell you I have been on a luxurious vacation or on a big conference, but the truth is, it's been a rough week, but I was determine to post today. I have for you today a project updated. Do you remember my other vintage picture frame? I really wanted the frame to look more warmer and not so gold looking. So, I took out my handy dandy glazing and went to town. I really love the way it look and I can now finish up the next phase of this project. Did I mention I am a bit OCD? (wink) Seriously, I am. I can DIY a project and once it is done I will stare at it for months, till I figure out what is missing. I know; I need to just relax. God isn't finish with me yet. (smile)!
1 Jn 1:5-7 (Phi) Here, then, is the message which we heard from him, and now proclaim to you: GOD IS LIGHT and no shadow of darkness can exist in him. Consequently, if we were to say that we enjoyed fellowship with him and still went on living in darkness, we should be both telling and living a lie. But, if we really are living in the same light in which he eternally exists, then we have true fellowship with each other, and the blood which his son Jesus shed for us keeps us clean from all sin.

We are so excited to have each of you following along with us, especially since sometimes I feel I let you down. Thank you for hanging in there with us! As soon as I yelled upstairs to Tony the great news....his words were, "lets plan a give away" I have an idea....and so does he...so we'll try to marry the two together!!
Eventually, he became accustomed to being outside most of the time. One night he got confused and went to the neighbors sliding glass door and tried to get in. Thank goodness they knew the girls had a possum.

Then, after about 2 seconds of band practice, my husband accidentally scratched me with the end of one of his guitar strings causing blood to spill out of my arm. Going to the bathroom to clean up, I found that oozing blood was the least of my problems. I had just found flaw number two… Being tight, this shirt fits VERY close to my underarms. Practicing on stage, under the heat of the lights… Well, let’s just say blood wasn’t the only bodily fluid currently flowing outside of my body, and my shirt was SCREAMING this out for the whole world to hear/see.

Sadico Amor (aka "Sadistic Love") is very disturbing. Yes it's low budget but the movie feels real, it doesn't feel staged at all. I guess it feels real since stuff like this unfortunately does happen. Also, the beating scenes look like they were done for real. Im pretty sure they were real since we do (actually) see fists hitting faces very hard.

Egypt is one of the most history rich cultures in the world! It’s no wonder that when I spent 14 days in Egypt, it didn’t seem like it was long enough.

Down in Pilsen at Polvo the vibe was completely different. The show was well attended, but didn’t feel as though it were overrun by too many hipsters or yuppies. There wasn’t the feel of trying to act cool or important or impressive. And it was actually about the art. You could view it and there were interesting discussions happening. Unfortunately, it is the hipsters which make a scene and yuppies which pay the bills. It is a great thing that Chicago has at least three major neighborhoods of art. And a fourth with Westown.

The opening sequence is the second best part of the episode (after the River revelation), and it sees the Doctor and Rory infiltrating the Cybermen’s Cyber Fleet. The sequence is intercut with the Eye Patch Lady taking Melody away from Amy, and Amy telling Melody about Rory, and it ends with Rory the Roman walking onto the command center of the head Cybership and announcing, “I’ve got a statement and a question. The statement is from the Doctor and the question is from me: Where is my wife?” Rory then walks across the room to stand in front of a window to outer space, telling the Cybermen that he knows they listen to everything that happens in this section of the galaxy.

Jesus’ astonishing point is that God saving action continues to be worked out. Far from the resurrection being a nonsense, it is the climax and completion of God’s redemptive action in the world. If death is the last word for the Patriarchs, God has not kept his promises and is shown to be powerless and the Scriptures are unfulfilled.

Visible Voice Books, located in Cleveland opened back in 2007. It’s a independent bookstore that sells new and used books, if something you want is not available they will order it. Events such as author book signings and open mic are a regular thing there.
During the talks about old times and life in Deutschland during a difficult era, it sorta hit me. Being apart from my country for so long has made me forget the obvious. Experiencing firsthand how Germans are still viewed among foreigners and also among Jews has sometimes made me feel rather ashamed of my heritage than proud of my country. But we cannot be misled by false thoughts and by misrepresented views of small-minded people or folks who have never left their own country to get to know other cultures. And life back then was not how life is right now. Most of my generation will never be able to comprehend the mentalities, the personalities, and the motives of the people that have lived 100 years ago. So judging these events from a perspective of today will always be shadowed by the obstacle of time and change.

As news goes this is big, so you can imagine my utter despair at having to keep this under my baker boy cap until details were finalised. No telling family, no telling friends, no telling colleagues, no telling. As a journalist and professional talker this wasn’t just a challenge; it was a feat of untold willpower.

The environment in which you sleep is crucial to the development of healthy sleep. The ideal location is dark, quiet, and cool. Light and noise make it difficult to fall asleep, and even the slightest noise can wake you at the end of a REM cycle. Once you have been awakened and thrust into a light environment you will find it extremely difficult to return to a slumbering state. The space should also be a comfortable temperature. If a room is too hot or too cold the body has to do extra work to stay warm. This heightening of the senses makes sleep easy to achieve.
That obviously means that you should believe (most of the time only) some things that you read and hear unless it is based on Scripture. That’s the only absolute thing. The key thing is to always ask “why?” Whichever song becomes the next hit, ask “why?” Do the same with bestsellers, hit movies, T.V shows, and anything that’s made a huge deal of. The most important area to ask the “why” question is the news.

A moment of clarity where clarity most often strikes, pinpointed my discontent: the blue colour just ruins it, providing the visual focus as to why this is simply not an Arsenal shirt. Looking at the long-sleeved version, I should imagine that even the Fancy Dans who wear gloves in cold weather will be praying that the tradition of the Arsenal captain wearing the sleeves involves the shorter version; they are quite simply ghastly. Oh, and when you have explain that the obsidian hoops on the sleeve are blue, it is blue unless of course you are disappearing up your own arsenal-hole at a rapid rate of knots. Ask Bono, he’s an expert on that one. One final thought; why is AFC printed on the back in the embroidery style of you gran’s 1970 knitting patterns? What next, Arsenal Rally jackets?

That is where the truth of the play lies for me—in the desperate need for human connection. Whether that be with one’s child or parent or sibling or friend or lover, we humans have an innate need to relate with one another to feel whole. We define who we are in relation to others in our lives. There is no us without them; life cannot exist in a vacuum. The desperation lies in those times when we find ourselves in a place of stasis, when we either lose a link to someone important to us, or we strive for a relationship that just won’t be made, when we feel alone and separated.

The novel begins with Hel, retired in his late fifties in a small castle overlooking a village of the Haute-Soule, in the mountainous Northern Basque Country. He is an honorary member of the local Basque population, and his best friend among them is Beñat Le Cagot, a truculent Basque nationalist and bard, with whom he shares an immense love for freedom and an addiction to spelunking. Hel thinks he is now allowed to enjoy life in a shibui way (mingling discreet epicureanism with fatalism and detachment) and he slowly improves his Japanese garden, enjoys restrictive gastronomy, and practices highly esoteric sex with his concubine.

The following books have been offered to the Journal of Intellectual Property Law and Practice (JIPLP) for review. If you would like to volunteer to review one of these titles, please email Sarah Harris at Oxford University Press at sarah.harris@oup.com by Sunday 4 December and let her know your particular interest or expertise in the subject that would qualify you to tackle the task. After that date, you will receive either confirmation that your offer to review has been accepted or a grateful acknowledgement of the fact that you have offered, even though the review has been given to another. Suitably qualified volunteers to review who are unsuccessful will be given priority when next they request to review a book.
With a wicked grin of arrogance, he gazed down at the pleading pale face. He pulled her upright and turned her to face him. The glowing emerald eyes staring back amused him, he smiled inwardly recognizing the tell-tale sign of dilated pupils, lust clearly reflected back. He inhaled deeply. Bloody bollocks! The woman has lusty thoughts. He instantly knew the arousal she felt was a natural reaction and nothing his vampire powers created. His cock got impossibly hard from being in such close proximity to her and this wasn’t the vampire beast begging for release.
Understandably, thousands of victims of Vedanta’s environmental and human rights abuse see little endearing in Binno’s smile. Now among them are 500 children from Odisha’s Puri district who belong to families affected by the Vedanta University Project (VUP). On 10 February, they suddenly became dispensable liabilities in the MNC’s mega scheme of things.

Another example. You've been in the car all day with your siblings and it's getting late at night and you've been told to be quiet so that your younger brother will keep sleeping. All of a sudden everything is funny and being quiet is impossible because everything makes you giggle. Uncontrollable silly laughter that is unstoppable, even IF your strict father says sternly from the driver's seat, “Flamsa INTE!” I probably don't even need to translate that...it means don't be flamsig...so you put your pillow over your face to try to mask your laughter. But it's a tenuous quiet. All it takes to start the whole cycle again is one look at your sister making a goofy face and you're

In areas of high erosion hazard, the National Flood Insurance Program will pay the owners of threatened buildings 40 percent of either their value or the amount of their coverage to move them inland, said James L. Taylor, assistant administrator for the program. The money helps cover the costs of moving the house and re-establishing it on a new lot. If a property owner agrees to demolish the structure, the payment rises to 100 percent, plus 10 percent for cleanup costs. But anything later built on the property is ineligible for insurance, he said.

The baby pekins have resided in the garage in makeshift accomodation up until this point. They have made firm friends with the serama, and often pop over for dinner. But ultimately they need to integrate with the big girls.

So today I have bitten the bullet. Flo and Winnie are moving up in to the Palace.
The theme of this date was Ben doing anything he could to get Courtney to admit she is awful at communicating with humans so he could allow his penis to guide him straight to matrimony. Her goal was simply to keep her hair out of her face, ask Ben questions when he asks her questions, say not much of anything, look hot and prove that the 8 weeks of Meisner acting school she got for free for sleeping with an instructer-slash-bartender in Santa Monica at least, if nothing else, taught her how to cry on cue. My guess is that to cry she just thinks about her father’s sweaters and her sister’s nose.

“Let them not blush in Me, that wait for Thee, O Lord, Lord of virtues” (ver. 6). Again, the voice of the Head, “Let them not blush in Me:” let it not be said to them, Where is He on whom ye were relying? Let it not be said to them, Where is He that was saying to you, Believe yet God, and in Me believe? “Let them not blush in Me, that wait for Thee,” O Lord, Lord of virtues. Let them not be confounded concerning Me, that seek Thee, O God of Israel.” This also may be understood of the Body, but only if thou consider the Body of Him not one man: for in truth one man is not the Body of Him, but a small member, but the Body is made up of members. Therefore the full Body of Him is the whole Church. With reason then saith the Church, “Let them not blush in Me, that wait for Thee, O Lord, Lord of virtues.”…

We have gates on the deck to keep the dogs (we have two) from accidentally (accidentally to us, intentionally to them) getting out and running loose around the neighborhood. When they need to relieve themselves, we hook a cable to the collar and let them off the deck individually, then come back later to unhook the cable and let them back onto the deck. The deck has two steps down to the ground. Yesterday, when I went to bring Toby in, he was waiting for me on the second step. I opened the gate, and he tried unsuccessfully to climb the one step to the deck. He had to go back down to the ground, two paces back, and make a run at it.

Dexter is a blood splatter specialist working for the Miami police department. His adopted father was a cop and his sister is a cop. A serial killer has begun chopping up prostitutes and dumping them in a particular way. Sister, Debora, is determined to find the killer so that she can finally get that transfer to Homicide she has always wanted. She calls on Dex to help as he seems to have a knack for solving these things. What she doesn't know is why. Dexter is able to put himself so perfectly into the mind of a killer because he is the same. Only his father taught him to go for the bad guys. If he has to kill then kill those who deserve it. This new killer on the seen though is an artist. Dexter can appreciate him and he isn't sure if he wants him to be caught.
DOI interviewed over 150 witnesses including employees from DSNY, DOT, various elected officials, and several dozen members of the public. DOI also read numerous emails, viewed photos from the public, reviewed hours of video footage obtained from the public and law enforcement sources, issued numerous subpoenas, and conferred with several different prosecutors located in New York City. A number of positive conclusions and important corrections to the record should be emphasized. Most importantly, the allegations of a slow-down were never verified and appear to be completely unfounded.

Different web sites work in a different way, although the majority of sites follow exactly the same pattern. Usually, the customer must register with the actual daily offers website to get hot deals available.

Since they are limited period deals, it’s important to behave immediately should you spot the deal you want to make the most of.

After a good break to Taiwan, I'm back to face reality. We were on a Free & Easy holiday, that means alot of prep work to be done, from booking of plane tickets, itinerary and accommodation. And just a week before our departure, DD1 developed a high fever of 40.4C. With her fever, I kept her home and she had to miss 2 papers of her final year examinations. I just couldn't take any risk since she wasn't in a good state of mind to take her exam, might as well keep her home. However, I was taking another risk, worried that she might not end up in the top class since her final year exam results will be computed based on her mid-year exam. The first thing I reached Singapore was to text the teacher to find out her results :P I'm thankful she maintained her standard and will be going to the better class next year, but on the other hand, I fear she might not be able to catch up in the "elite" class. Being a dawdler, she needs to put in more effort to improve her attitude in learning. I can only wish for the best.

Most likely, you are the ones that LOVE your job and our kids that you teach. Wouldn't it be better incentive to do a great job, if your raises depended on it.

But none of it really works; the path to happiness won’t come from Kaoru imitating Sentarou. Instead it will come from Kaoru being himself, allowing his own personality to blossom. The very first sign of this comes in the improv session, as he finally feels the soul of the music flow through him. After a few tentative taps at the keys, he finally begins to play without a care in the world. A smile creeps across his face as he plays a lively glissando, fingers floating fluidly across the keyboard. He loses himself in the music. Kaoru’s first attempt at the opening to Moanin’ was deemed unfit for purpose: “I couldn’t feel any swing!” yells Sentarou in the first episode. Now, Kaoru might finally have found the missing piece, the key thing that is missing from his music: passion.

Determined to curtail it, Chad tries to befriend the boy, getting him to walk the fire house dog—a paid position in a town with volunteer firefighters—and reaching out to the boy’s mother. Soon he realizes that Jeannie isn’t as overwhelmingly happy as she seems—she’s hiding a lot of fear and pain behind it. And Nick isn’t as he seems either.

Put a dab of icing on a cardboard round cut just larger than the cake. Center one cake layer on the round. Place a large blob of icing in the center of the layer and spread it to the edges with an icing spatula. Hold the spatula at a 45-degree angle to the cake and drag it across the surface to level the icing. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with remaining cake layers. To ice the sides of the cake, scoop up a large dab of icing with the tip of the spatula and spread it on the sides with short side-to-side strokes. Sprinkle the top of the cake with coconut. Then press the coconut into the sides, letting the excess fall back onto a baking sheet.
This has been an exciting week for me — my books were released in print form , I had a fabulous turnout at my “Hallelujah My Novels Have Finally Been Published! Let’s Party!“ party, and now my books have been Kindled, or whatever you call it when they are made available as Kindle books. I almost feel as if that calls for another party, but it took me a couple of months to plan the first, so by the time I give the party, the Kindle books will be old news. I guess I’ll wait until my third book comes out later this year to throw another cyberparty. Should be fun planning it, though, to be honest, I don’t think people will find the release of a third book quite as exciting as the dual release of the first two.

I know in the past I’ve matched up a lot of socks and I’ve even tossed some in my time…but that’s a lot of unmatched socks for a family of five! Breaking them down, I find that I have:
Doing this is hard, no doubt – there’s a certain level of resistance in our families, our friends, those who question what we do. Many observers see us allowing our children to eat what they want, watch what they want, say what they want, etc, and make the natural assumption that we are indulging our children. They believe that these indulgences are short-sighted; that we are choosing the easy path of least resistance by being overly permissive now, but setting our children up for long-term difficulties as they try to adapt to the "real world." I understand that. But I do not agree with it. I think that when you help your children focus on passions, you're taking a long-term view of your child's life and setting them up for success beyond your wildest dreams. How? By setting up an environment in which we model the pursuit of our own passions without expectations or conditions; by allowing and encouraging our children's passions and exploration without judgment; by trusting that our children will do what's right for them even if it's not what we would choose for them or for ourselves. Doing this authentically and wholeheartedly helps our children understand that their views have value, that their passions have value, that their thoughts have value - that they have value. And that builds a confidence that enables them to try new things and explore their passions as well as their fears. But most critically, it enables them to see the world through their own eyes and to define success on their own terms.
Protests led by Buddhist monks challenging the military junta in Myanmar turned deadly, and things look like they’re going to get worse. Minus Five
The clamor began years ago for more blacks in the media and in all walks of life: we were told repeatedly, that black kids learn better when taught by people who ‘look like them,’ and that is considered normal and healthy.
Two days later I received a phone call advising me to come and see my doctor as soon as possible---the caller was the nurse at the doctor's practice so I asked if my blood results were that bad----she said that they weren't good, so I asked her to get another pathology form from the doctor so that I could get more blood tested at another pathology firm---I told her of my experience with the pathology nurse and how small the samples would have been-----she told me to come in straight away and she would take the blood for testing.
I've been increasingly frustrated with my nails lately, they're not growing past a certain length and I've just been hating on them in general! I was always dubious about false nails as I've seen the damage they can do (Especially if you bite or pull them off.... Ahem.. please don't), but I was honestly so fed up with my natural ones that I picked up these from Boots:
Last night, Cody, Manning, and I loaded up after work to go get haircuts from my sister. After being at her shop for a couple of hours, we rushed out the door and decided on going through the Chick-fil-A drive-thru because it was a quick, easy choice. We wanted to hurry and get little man home because it was already past his bedtime. As soon as we got on the highway, he drifted off, so Cody and I enjoyed a peaceful ride home and got to enjoy one another's company.
Sunburn. I went to the shore this year and burned something fierce. The whole time I was at the shore, I was so “on program”, walking miles everyday, drinking my water, etc. I came home and was up 7 pounds. 7 ugly horrible pounds. I thought, “You got to be kidding me.” I was also the shade of a cooked lobster and sore. I noticed my rings were very tight and I thought, “Could the sunburn actually be swelling me up?” After doing some research, sure enough. The sunburn was the culprit because I burned my body with the sun. My body was trying to heal itself as it would with any other burn, by holding onto water. Literally within a week, my burn faded and those pounds went away and I didn’t do anything different other than stay on program, drink my water and work out like I always did.
Sometimes it’s as simple as needing to get rid of a broken fridge or television. It doesn’t work anymore, it’s taking up room, get it the hell out of here. Fair enough. That makes perfect sense and no one can deny the legitimacy of that claim. Got to make way for the new.
Outside my window a dove is working itself up into a lather. Nervous collapse is imminent. It struts like a Grenadier drill sergeant. Its neck is curved as a drawn bow. Its chest bulges with simmering aggressiveness. It pounds the balcony tiles with pink feet. From its throat comes a furious rumbling. It is spluttering with foiled rage... How, I wonder once more, did the dove become the emblem of peace?

My license plate says “Eat. Sleep. Tennis.” And that’s pretty much how things roll with me and my gang in the Evanshirehood. Normally. But you know me and normal. Hardly ever on the same page, let alone in the same sentence connected by a conjunction junction whose function is to hook up words and make them function and such. Anyway, it was recently brought to my attention that I have barely graced the poor tennis courts behind the Evanshire this summer. Last Thursday I hosted a girls night out and invited my long lost tennis girlfriends. When they started arriving at the door with bottles of wine they all had this similar look on their faces. It was like they were trying to place where they’d seen me before.
I could burn the midnight oil and write lots of descriptive words that go with these pictures, but they pretty much tell a story all by themselves. And I happen to think it's a better one than I could come up with...at least in my present state of semi-comatose post-weekend deliriousness. I just need my pillow. So I'll let the pictures do most of the story telling, with just a few hints from me on plot and props.
Until then, big hugs and take care,
Well, no. We probably can't, except to offer advice.
A musical dialogue between Jim Webb and Michael Mooney.
It was so close that as a general rule we knew almost everything that went on over there, knew of the killin’s and the rapes that occurred most every Saturday night, or at least we thought we knew. But as fate would have it, the river acted as a natural border and on each side there was two separate towns as distinct from each other as any two countries that shared a border, with our side relatively quiet and sleepy and their side the exact opposite. But we formed our opinions without really knowing each other, typecasting each other as sure as anything, utterly and it was literally like the pot calling the kettle black, it was all we knew (later disgusted with ourselves when we thought we knew better) in a rocky place we loved, once covered up to our knees in prairie grass, and when they had the best black river bottom land imaginable. And look at them! Compare them and us! Them and their shacks! And us.

Alex took great pains to dispel several ‘industry myths’ that circulate from time to time that paint Little Creatures as having moved away from all that made it many people’s favourite brewer. Over the past few years there have certainly been plenty of punters through the restaurant who have been convinced that ‘things have changed’ since ‘they became a mega-brewery’ and ‘stopped using real hops’...
We found our tent- we had reservations at the Haufbrauhaus Tent which is the largest tent at the festival holding over 9k people inside, upstairs and outside- and found the guy who's table we were buying seats at. There were 12 of us total and he led us inside and through the maze of people to our table. It was a MADHOUSE! And it was only 4pm. We were so happy to sit and just take it all in, an incredible site.
Why? What am I doing wrong? I know it’s important to Believe, Know and Feel that you are receiving—which is what I’ve been doing—but I have received. I was feeling very panicky and stressed this morning. I wanted to cry. I didn’t want to allow my doubts to take over my positive attitude but I was really having to work hard at staying positive. I reminded myself that all was good, I was receiving, the money I needed was coming to me. But I was sad. I needed a pick-me-up.
This book is made up of stories from his life that have a “dusting of divine fingerprints.” Each story begins with a teaser quote to draw the reader in: “I used to be afraid of failing at something that mattered to me, but now I’m more afraid of succeeding at things that don’t matter.” Each story concludes with a wise life observation: “. . . maybe we’re all a little like human origami and the more creases, the better.” And each story encourages us to put hands and feet on our love, even if it is “like a sword without a handle” and cuts us sometimes.
As it's Friday we're giving you all another chance to nose into our lives. And we expect reciprocal rights of course.
Since then, I’ve learned to appreciate frustrators; the people who look at the world different from me. Sometimes they don’t want what I want. Frequently, however, we want the same thing, but they’re frustratingly different.

2. As a result, the Town of Orleans has not been able to formulate a valid scientific basis to support its CWMP and the proposed use of T-T for a mega wastewater treatment plant. The official record compiled on these key groundwater issues is "incompetent, dishonest and makes a mockery of scientific methodology." This record, when reviewed as a body of work, raises serious questions of professional negligence, improper influence and persistent use of misinformation in the evaluation and permitting process. Liability should rightfully attach.
Please let me know any discrepancies on or before 31 MARCH 2012. The deadline for the grades is around 3 April, but I am well aware that some of you might need those grades as early as possible for certain reasons (working scholars, transfer credentials, enrollment). So please review your grades and tell me if I made a mistake somewhere. Some of the papers have already been given back to you, so please present those when you make your claim. If the paper in question is with me, I will be the one to check.
And as a result, I haven't been blogging. The positive has been very hard to find. So, if you are looking for a positive blog post you should probably close this window and go to the next blog on your list. I am in week 4 of pretending to be a stay-at-home mom. I was calling it a temporary early retirement until one of my friends reminded me she got 6 weeks off of work with each baby, and so now I am calling this my maternity leave.

At this point in my life I am motivated to be a man that my children and future wife can respect, admire, and look up to as a role model. A man who is successful in his professional life which was riddled with obstacles and booby-traps, who provides the comfort of safety and stability to the home, and ultimately a man of principal who stands for something. When you boil down life to what matters, all that you are left with is those who you love. I want to be the best I can be for them.
The Birth, the Life, and the Death of Christ ends in the tomb, as it must. The medieval angels return, wings freshly starched, and remove the lid of Jesus’s sarcophagus, which must weigh about 25 pounds. Smartly, Guy doesn’t have Jesus climb out of the stone box here; rather, the actor’s image is superimposed over it, hovering in a pose of ascension—again, drawn from classical painting, but ending with a sudden disappearance that only a shuttered camera can produce.
Still Chase’s wryness doesn’t leave her. In ‘Harp in the Sick Room’, for which this section is named, she tells us how
“Science. You know genetics, don’t you?” she scoffed and gestured for him to follow further as she lead him through a door and down a flight of stairs. “Maybe you need some medication more than you need lunch” she mused with a frown as she held the door to the basement open for him. She wondered if that gray substance was hallucinogenic through she reasoned more ordinary recreational drugs were much more likely.

Our very good friend Austin had a nice turn of phrase: "When Jacqueline and I were stepping out....", he used to say, indicating the time when he and his wife were a-courting. And he'd proceed to tell an engaging tale. (Not the one below; that's mine.)

Once in a while, if you're lucky, you get to meet someone outside of your normal social sphere; someone who carelessly crushes all the criteria you've formulated for friendship.
Now everything is organized in these drawers - the bottom drawer has stroller stuff in it and the other three have (1) purses and Ruby's coats/sweatshirts, (2) hats and gloves and (3) items that need to be returned or given away.
A more recent study conducted to reevaluate JAMA’s findings in regard to renal failure was published in the Alternative Health Practitioner. Acknowledging that the “study leaves several questions unanswered,” the author reported both similarities and variations in the iridologists’ readings and concluded that the iridologist’s level of expertise is extremely important as well.

As well as boycotting, be sure that you write or email the companies directly to express your concern about Senomyx's flavor program and their participation.

I don’t remember the last time a book moved me to tears the way The Fault In Our Stars did. I had to actually stop reading a few times as I couldn’t see through the tears. It could be because the story hit a bit close to home for me. But it also had everything to do with the fact that Green wrote the characters in such a way, that I felt like I knew them, that Hazel and Augustus were my friends and I cared what happened to them. I connected with them.
While taking a ticket to the Gilli islands, we had no idea which one we were about to arrive on. Upon reaching a heavy-built muscular tattooed lady tells us “You have come to the right island. This is Party Island.” Gilli Trawangan, and that if we need any magic mushrooms we should head over to the restaurant around the corner where her boyfriend would be happy to serve us some. I tell her that I have never tried it before, and she looks at me as if I was some sort of an amateur in her world. We thank her for her advice on where to stay which wasn’t very good advice. When you reach Gilli islands, with just a bit of patience you are likely to find an amazing place to stay. The entire island is just a stretch of 8kilometres of land; replete with Balinese villa’s, and rooms, diners, cafés & all-nighter parties, all lined up on the white sand archipelago. The only mode of transport is horse carts and bicycles. Everyone here is breathing the sun in their bathing suits, riding around in their bicycles from their rooms to the restaurants, to devour a plate of freshly caught prawns

For Thanksgiving, I opened a number of bottles, ranging from a Lambrusco to a VORS (30+ year old) Oloroso Sherry. I like to have an assortment of wines, something for everyone, as well as enough to last throughout the day. Per my own Thanksgiving wine suggestions, I also opened a bottle of sake, which I have done before for Thanksgiving. I was pleased to see that this year I opened the same sake as the fine folks of Sakaya, Rick and Hiroko.

When she was more than 80 years old, Agnes died in her daughter’s home in New Jersey in 1907. She was buried next to her first husband in Cincinnati. On the other hand, Calamity Jane was buried next to Wild Bill Hickok.
I like very much the story.This book is filled with fantasy,romance,mystery and a lot of humor.This is the perfect mix,and that’s why “Ruby Blue” it’s PERFECT!I like,also,how the fantasy is mixed with the normality.I mean,in one second Ruby sees fairies,and in the next second,she kisses Nick,her boyfriend.The fantasy it’s great balaced with the teenager things and drama and other stuff.Ohter REAL stuff.

That little gold book sitting atop is none other than Neil Gaiman's A Little Gold Book of Ghastly Stuff, which is a very small but well put together collection of some of Neil's more obscure fiction, poems, reviews, and some speeches. Borderlands is still selling the unsigned edition if you're interested. Next is the signed limited edition of Brent Weeks' Perfect Shadow, which I read in e-form earlier this year. Then we have a Christmas present with 1493 by Charles C. Mann, his follow-up to 1491 which still stands as one of my favorite history books for the last 10 years. The huge book at the bottom was another Christmas gift and if you somehow can't make out the title is an M.C. Escher Pop-Up Book. So yeah, it is pretty dang cool. I also got a bunch of gift certificates that will most likely be spent on books quite soon.

Let’s change Ralph to a girl. You can edit the character’s name (I have changed it to “Alice” here) in the top part of the middle column of the window. You can make it pretty much anything you like, but keep in mind that people like to be able to say the names of their characters; this is likely why so many popular characters have such simple names (Link, Mario, Arthas ).

My transition was simple. My last chemical relaxer was in January 2011. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do next. At the time, I really thought it was going to be the perfect time for me to start the dreadlocks I had always admired on others and wanted on myself. So, I waited about three months until I had a decent amount of new growth. I went to the salon and had kinky twist extensions braided into my hair. I was so excited about making the transition! I had reached a point in my life where what people thought of me had become the least of my concerns. This new venture was going to be an investment in my personal happiness. Plus, it completed my desire to physically change my body and myself naturally. And so my motto became: “If ‘you’ do not like it – TOO BAD! Nothing personal!”

Both Lee Goldberg and I are using Amazon's CreateSpace to release some of our ebook bestsellers in print, and by Fall all of my ebooks will be available in dead tree versions, priced at $12 for a trade paperback. While I don't see this as being a huge cash cow (I'll still earn more from a $2.99 ebook sale than a $11.99 paperback sale), I find it interesting that the stigma of self-publishing is fading fast.
Unfortunately, because of my job (baby-sitting at my house) I can't just move to any house we'd like. It has to remain a reasonable drive for the families of the kids I watch. So we are pretty limited. Hopefully we find something.
So... I'm going to be really selective with my pictures choices here. I had a lot of pictures. So maybe these won't be a good portrayal of all the stuff we did, but at least they're mostly nice to look at.

I do have comic news tho... after several days of Piggy McBingey I was on my bed feeling depressed, and ended up doing a brief 20 hr water fast just cuz I didn't want to get up. Always water at my bedside tho. But anyway after just lying there my computer-moronic brain finally figured out how to deal with bmp to jpg conversions. It was like "umm hello?

Again, the whole point is that even in these difficult and confusing times, the Magisterium continues to teach 100% of the doctrines of our Faith, including full biblical inerrancy. The neo-geos only wish that they had anything like that sort of statement in support of geocentrism in the past 300 years or more. Too bad for them, they don’t. Their only two options are to continue to throw the Catholic Magisterium under the bus as incompetent, dishonest and bumbling, or to admit that geocentrism is not a doctrine of the Faith. Unfortunately, they consistently choose the former.
Anyway, thanks for coming by, I can't wait to show you my finished homework for the month.

I was gripped by this book from start to finish. There is no doubt that there are plot flaws, many of which Maxine has pointed out, and I understand and sympathise with her reservations – which are, again characteristically, expressed in a very fair way. What is more, I think it’s absolutely reasonable to judge such a successful book by the toughest standards – tougher than those applied to less celebrated efforts, for sure.

Basically, I have driven her crazy! She even said she wasn’t going to talk about going anymore if I brought it up again! This morning we left the house early to pick one of her friends up and get to the bus station on time. I started to mention the times of the buses whilst we were driving, but she cut me off and said she KNEW what was going on and so did everybody else and could I STOP MITHERING HER!!!
A new conventional wisdom is evolving to explain the causes of the decline and how to address them. Among the key elements of this new orthodoxy are the notions that the U.S. is lagging badly in innovation and education. This diagnosis, of course, leads directly to prescriptions for greater spending on and government support of R&D and much greater emphasis on getting students not only into and out of college but into advanced and professional degrees.
Waters also discussed the ANC centenary: “Happy 100th year anniversary to @MyANC_. You (sic) job is not done… but, a job well done in the past 100 years… You will rule till the rapture”.
Unlike most Republicans, I’m just fine with gays and gay marriage. It’s hard enough to find someone to love and that you can stand to be with in a committed relationship, whether you be straight or not. You can’t help who you fall in love with. Being gay isn’t a choice.

It was a beautiful evening, but the long drive and the quantity of beer were combining to make me sleepy. We returned to the hotel. And rather quickly. I don't go to Dallas often enough to know my way around (thank goodness for GPS). While I knew both the restaurant and the hotel were downtown, I didn't know just how close they were.
So throw open a window, and enjoy the week-end!
Speaking for the first time about why she spends so much annually on flowers, on visits to his grave from France and commemorations of his life, Veronique Crombe, a lecturer and guide at the French National Museum, explains that it was a film about Collins that changed her life.

Today, I have an optimistic view on life.
Jongleurs may wear leather and studded leather armor only, and may not use shields. Jongleurs can use all hurled weapons, i.e., any weapon that can be thrown (daggers, hand axes, spears), but not including bows, blowguns, or other missile weapons that are fired or shot. Otherwise, Jongleurs are restricted to the following weapons: polearm, quarterstaff, and sling. All of the weapons usable by Jongleurs can be used in their performances. For example, they can juggle daggers, pole vault with polearms, and balance with spears or quarterstaffs.

This is a followup to my earlier article, How to use Google Voice for free outgoing calls on an Asterisk/FreePBX system (the easy way). Starting with Asterisk 1.8 it’s a whole lot easier, and doesn’t require you to have a separate DID or Gizmo5 account to bring in the calls. My goal was to simplify (as much as possible) the dial plan code used, especially the code that has to be entered into /etc/asterisk/extensions_custom.conf, and to speed up execution by getting rid of unnecessary waits (why make callers wait extra seconds if you don’t have to? That’s just inconsiderate).

Also in typical Project Runway fashion, there was a “surprise” last-minute addition to the challenge, which of course was not a “surprise” at all because the producers insist upon doing it every season. Robo-Joanna informed the designers they would have to create a sixth look out of old scraps from past challenges. The use of old materials seemed like a crazy requirement – the judges always complain when final collections aren’t “cohesive,” so why force the designers to work with fabrics that potentially don’t fit with the collections they had already conceptualized and begun developing? Yet another head-scratching element of Project Runway All-Stars.
Travis looked eighteen years old, but was polite and chatty. We were to head off to another address to collect five of his friends. About half-way there he moved forward to talk through the divider.

My love of IKEA reached manic-levels when I was pregnant to my first children. Armed with colour-coordinated textas and the IKEA catalogue I was circling away like a woman possessed. Waddling about with my industrial tapemeasure, taking measurements and tweeking floorplans. "We'll need wardrobes, bookshelves, tallboys, rugs, light fixtures, shelves, shelves, I NEED MORE SHELVES!!!!", I ordered at my husband, who was nodding and cowering in a corner, no match for the power of IKEA. Hubby was wise enough to know that you don't argue with a hormonal pregnant woman, especially one who is carrying TWINS!!!!!

An affirmation is a declaration of something that's true; an affirmation prayer is a religious or metaphysical technique that focuses on a positive outcome instead of a negative one (thanks, Wikipedia!). While "prayer" is a term I shy away from, because I dislike anything that has religious connotations, I think of an affirmation as being a collection of positive thoughts that sees you through hard times, and I think it's important for everyone to have one.
A warm welcome to my new sponsors:
First, there is "Wassalissa the Beautiful," a Russian tale about the maiden who dares to fetch fire from the fearsome sorceress, Baba Yaga. Second is "Frau Holle," a tale from the Brothers Grimm collection about a downtrodden girl who leaps down a well after her bloodied spindle, emerges in a land of unparalleled beauty ruled by a fierce-looking but gracious old woman. The maiden works hard for her new mistress, then comes home showered in gold. However, her greedy sister is showered in filth. The third tale is an obscure Flemish story called "The Three Mirrors of the Sorceress," and is about bringing the dead back to life.
In the fall of 1971, singer, songwriter Don McLean released his epic song about experiencing the tumultuous 1960s, entitled “American Pie.” It has a lot of specific and vague references to musical events that shaped his (and our) consciousness while growing up in the 1950s and ’60s. It is also a lament for the idealistic “America” that finally vanished during that same period. The Civil Rights Movement, political assassinations, and events of the Vietnam War changed our country, and the music that was being created became a reflection of those turbulent times. Buddy Holly, J.P. Richardson and Richie Valens were killed in 1959 when their plane crashed near Clear Lake, Iowa, while on tour. Don McLean felt we had lost a whole lot more than just those three gifted musicians, and his tale still resonates to this very day. Much has happened since 1971, so I thought it was time to add a few more verses for these last 40 years.
For now, I just knew I had to save $108 a day.

With regard to European expenses, again it is the public perception that matters, as you rightly agree. What I have heard, and no doubt you will castigate me for having listened to anti-party propaganda, but what I have heard is that you attend in order to claim the attendance allowance and then beat a hasty retreat back home again. Somewhat reminiscent of what has been going on the House of Lords. Apparently they get over £300 for just turning up, sign in and then attend to their London business outside the House. If you have not been guilty of this sort of thing, then what it does show is that you need to be far more aggressive in rebutting all the whispering and lies that are in the ether and indeed, promoting your virtues.

An old joke has it that a pessimist sees only the holes in Swiss cheese, whereas an optimist sees only the cheese. Perhaps there are also critics who manage to see the cheese above all, and the holes, if holes there are, only in second place. Howard was surely one of those.

Feeling really out of sorts today and out of it – I’ll try and make sense, but forgive me if I wander off a bit, or go into the next (figurative) room and forget to say goodbye or something like that. I’m thinking I’m dong pretty good just getting at another chapter on Gibbon, esp. a chapter on monasticism – not my favorite subject (although at one time I had thought of becoming a monk – but that’s another story for another time).
The only thing that will fix this is to cut spending and re-evaluate why so many people in my generation (and others) are shouting “please will you fix it for me?”* to the government.
One of the bolts on the valve cover that holds the air cleaner down is broken so I’m planning to swap out that from the 87. I also plan to swap out the air cleaner since the one on the 87 is better.

Remember what Obama said on October 18, 2011, about how important it was that he, as president, express solidarity with the Occupy protesters and redouble his commitment to achieving a society in which “people who are irresponsible, who are reckless, who don’t feel a sense of obligation to their communities and their companies and their workers … that those folks aren’t rewarded.”

I’ve included a link for more information, a photo of Nancy and me on the bridge and a view of the structure itself. It’s so high up in the sky that it’s hard to take photos of the height. I’d love to ride the trail in the fall. I think it would be incredibly beautiful with all the trees.

José González Padrón serves as one of a handful of Cuban Military Attachés around the world. Like the ambassador, he is a recent arrival, having served as Havana’s Military Attaché in Moscow through at least late November 2011. An Attaché posting is not necessarily synonymous with service in Cuba’s little known Directorate of Military Intelligence (DIM). That said, Military Attachés are universally known to include overt intelligence collection in their official duties.
I am sleepy. Like, most of the time. On weekends, most of my favorite moments are spent with Oliver and Michael, but the rest of them, well, are spent napping.
But the situation in Russia started changing dramatically once Vladimir Putin came to power in the year 2000. The Russian economy, which was almost obliterated during the 1990s, came back strongly and has been growing by leaps and bounds for the past decade. The ongoing economic, financial, political, legal, military, police and social reforms completely changed Russia’s landscape.

We’ve just about made it through another winter, and it’s worth remembering that our winters are not nearly as harsh as those of our forbears.’ During the 19th century, the East River was regularly rife with enormous chunks of ice that jammed up ferry traffic, leaving freezing passengers stuck out in the middle of the harbor for hours on end. Until 1883, there was no Brooklyn Bridge to carry people over to Manhattan. In fact, the ice floes in the river were a chief reason that people called for the construction of a bridge, so that commerce would not freeze along with the water.

From the shenanigans in the boardroom (initiated by the departure of David Dein) to the fact that our beloved, but ancient, assistant manager embarrassingly still takes the warm up (whilst forgetting the ‘spirit & character’ that got him his 1971 double winners’ medals).
Next in to play was Irene, with two adorable baby gift cards which you can see here. So elegant I think, predominantly white with just the right touches of blue and pink. Irene makes some truly elegant cards - certainly there's a real knack to it and I so admire those of you who manage to pull them off with such flair. Well done Irene.
We need not have worried as the hat tick came. Johnson tidied up a Norwich attack with a long clearance to our man who was just inside the Norwich half. Clearly he couldn’t be bothered to do what Torres did against Barcelona and run on to instigate a one on one with Ruddy so he just chipped him from 40 odd yards out!

Whenever I've watched Dance Moms with her, my reaction to said moms constantly bitchin' and moanin' about the dance teacher's constant bitchin' and moanin', the questionable taste in costumes and routines, the apparent favoritism, and the snarky backstabbing and sniping at each has been the same:
Moral of the story: Patience is so important in a relationship, if he's worth the wait, be patient. But also, don't hold your feelings inside - don't wait to be eyeball full of Pinot G before you express yourself to your boyfriend in a dive bar parking lot on a Saturday night - and always wear water proof mascara.
So, which is it? Is worship something physical, tangible, and full of substance, or is worship an activity; something we choose to participate in, such as singing songs on Sunday mornings? Worship actually is both; the blending of two definitions — the noun and the verb. The best example of this mixture of two definitions is in the Hebrews’ view of worship.
I've also picked up this lovely little display cabinet which will also be subjected to a coat of paint. But I think I'll keep this one - its already been awarded a spot in our bedroom.
Forbearance and longsuffering are extremely hard for fallen sinners to practice, because the “common sense” view is that forbearance and longsuffering only lead to more abuse. But, according to the Bible, when God is at work, forbearance and longsuffering actually lead to repentance – a change for the better!

Well, its simple really. These are 9 different lives. Its like the biographies of 9 different people. Each life is contained in its own - a separate story.
The Bible says that it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. ~ Hebrews 6:4-6

The suburbs themselves break down into different factions, too. You’ve got the outer suburbs, like Gwinnett County, which are seeing a true inversion, and the inner suburbs, which often still suffer from high poverty and high crime. I would think that as the inner cores of cities become more and more expensive, these inner-ring suburbs would inevitably gentrify completely. Is that too simple an assumption?
Which somehow led to Dick’s story about two children, living with their grandmother because their mother was a drug addict who didn’t care about them, who were taken away from their grandmother, split apart, and put into foster care in the city where their mother was in rehab so they could see her. She didn’t want to see them and they didn’t want to see her but, what the hell, the social service agency made the decision based on what would cost them the least.
This week I published two posts only. This one here is my third. The first, vanity and vice and everything nice, was uncharacteristically and precociously sardonic (uncharacteristic to my blog, not to my natural sense of humor), dry to the point that some did not detect it and I felt sufficiently agitated to add a disclaimer, something I must be overly wrought to do, have only been tempted to do two or three times, and have since been advised against. Better for the reader to reach his own conclusions.

Anyway, fast forward a few years, and we've amassed a selection of Bible verses that really speak to us, inspire us with how we ought to live, how we try to treat each other, and encourage us in our faith. So I spent an afternoon/evening looking them up, copying them into a document, and then playing with font size and weighting to create some word 'art' for the wall of our living room.

Something closed over his chest, a tightness from right shoulder to just under left armpit, pressing him back into soft-but-sturdy flesh. He gasped, struggled, thought. Caught up; Taslin. At the edges of vision, threads of the Sherim writhed. Rel forced himself to breathe. Relaxation was too much to ask with the terrible spikes sliding silently at them. They picked up none of the Sherim's pink-and-purple lighting, and suddenly the rancid smell had a new, metallic edge; blood. Dora's?

I kegged the cluster hopped ale last week. I tasted the hydrometer sample and it was horribly pungent. I did not think I could get the beer past my tongue. A week later it is carbed up and I think the beer is actually good. The pale ale was a single hopped beer with cluster hops and had a lot of late hopping.

Our soloist is a 19-year-old young man who can relate to you the nature of this concerto with the heart of someone much older and wiser. He'll talk to you about Dvorak's personal life and then jump out of his seat, run over to his cello leaning in the corner and say, "Listen to this passage. This is exactly what I'm talking about!" And then on the fly, he'll play notes that will rip your heart out.

My sister asked me to make invitations for Thanksgiving dinner at her house this year. I thought a fun little turkey would be perfect and here is what I came up with. The cricut cut I used for the body of the turkey is a little unusual but it was exactly the shape I wanted. I used one of the Russian dolls on the Paisley cartridge and hid all the inside cuts with my Gypsy. Any my first instinct was to use a black marker for his eyes but I wanted him to have bright eyes so I used white - a bit unusual maybe but I think it works. I love the way the turkeys came out and the swirly dashes and blowey leaves say FALL to me. All materials are listed below.

But God’s love doesn’t stop there. He loves us in the midst of our brokenness. He loves us even while we shake our fist in His face, refusing to believe the diagnosis. God loves us by sacrificing himself and carrying our punishment and shame. He loves us by walking with us through restoration and healing. He loves us by listening to us and being patient with us.
As the book is the finale, things are resolved. We find out if Katniss chooses Peeta or Gale. We find out whether the Capitol is beaten or not. Did Mockingjay end how I wanted it to? I'm not sure, simply because I couldn't think of an ending I wanted. This series is just so complicated and so real, I couldn't picture an ending. But my god, what an end to the series! I really don't know what to say. I absolutely loved it, and I think Suzanne Collins is just a genius. This has got to be one of the best series ever written.
Making adjustments is a bad thing when its main result is to help you feel better about staying in a bad situation. I know golfers, for instance, who haven’t gotten a bit better in forever – except in their minds, where their “true” scores keep getting farther away from their “real” scores. Their fantasies, which originally were plausible, become increasingly implausible. Rather than motivating these golfers to improve in areas of weakness or get help with self-defeating behaviors, the adjustment-making simply creates a bright, shiny version of reality in which those problems aren’t really problems at all.

Last week was filled with lots of little stresses that made it long and kind of crappy. But I remember moments where I thought my life is pretty sweet. Kevin roasting beets for a salad that we both love. Beet salad. I was so happy about the salad and the fact that Kevin loves it as much as I do. And the fact that the beets were found at a farmers market that I didn't even know existed. You know the kind that set up shop in a parking lot, tables filled with things like beets and potatoes and honey at the foot of truck beds. Farmers drinking coffee and chatting to one another. Oh hello farmers I said to myself as I rounded the corner, thank you for making my day.

As I got the chance to see the fashion show, I felt a drastic change in the design, fabric and overall appearance when it was Istanbul Fashion Atelier's turn to present their pieces. Young, elegant and with an eccentric twist, each of the different designers has done a beautiful job in the creation. Individual and outstanding but then again harmonious to the rest of the numerous works, IFA's F/W 2012 collection has brought various factors on textiles together.

3) If you haven’t already turned the oven on, then now is a good time to preheat it at 375 degrees F.

So, if anything, I think perhaps there’s just a sense of modesty about what a philosophical project can do. But why not bring to the fore the radical potential implications for politics and ethics that a flat ontology, an object-oriented ontology, can have? Certainly this was Deleuze’s intent. That is, if you’re going to advocate for a flat ontology, why not also put the anti-oppressive aspects of that to the fore just as much as the ontological ones? Otherwise, what a missed opportunity!
Rief collects one class set of notebooks each day, so she is responding to students 4 days a week. She collects the notebooks every two weeks.

When asked what the quanties were worth, Madison told me "8 is an A; 4 is like the lowest."
In the mean time, I have been trying to think of ways to earn a little extra money for our adoption in addition to piano lessons and photography. I have been playing with what is called "SubwayArt".

One thing in particular I like about this book is that they don’t just give you the XML dialplan (although the XML is included), but the authors then explain to you how it works. In addition, in many cases they also give you additional related information, such as tweaks you can make to the XML to perform slightly different functions or otherwise modify the behavior, and links to additional resources you made need. So, you are not just viewing XML samples and then left on your own to puzzle out how they work!
Agreed, there are no dead mice in the wardrobe or cat pee stains on the carpet (there is no room in the wardrobe even for mice and we don't have a carpet). But it is a good demonstration of why hoarding stuff is A BAD THING and why pretty much everyone I know, except me, has a cleaner or an obliging mother who lives nearby and who cleans and babysits their kids every week, and why there are moments when I hate stay-at-home women whose kids are in school all day and who moan that they can't fit everything in. What I actually want to say is 'What the **** have you been doing all day? Writing a bestseller using alphabetti spaghetti?!' But of course I don't.
Let's be realistic: even though Bavaria have denied involvement, of course it was a marketing stunt: why else would forty identically dressed women turn up in one block?

Although God is sovereign there is one area where God allows us to be “sovereign”. The Sages of Israel say that everything is in the hands of heaven except the fear of heaven. This means, God decides how much money we have, where we will live, who our parents are – everything in our lives is decided by God. The one thing that is not decided by God is whether or not we will choose to obey God, and draw close to him, or to disobey God, and draw away from him. This is a decision each individual human being makes. This is what is called “free will”.
Another bit player who is in on the evil proceedings at Doc F's lair is a midget named Grazbo, who is played by Angelo Rossitto.

With the room empty, I wiped off all the shelves, swept and mopped the floor and washed the base boards. Then I focused on the things that were to come back in the room and the most efficient arrangement. As a result of my excellent 5S training I determined that the room was to be used for laundry, cleaning supplies and limited storage for things that are used regularly and need to be accessed easily. All of the tools were banished. Light bulbs found a new home under the sink. The box of glasses that hadn't been unpacked was washed and put in a cabinet. The craft boxes were sorted through and consolidated. The four soft side coolers and two small coolers were reduced to two soft coolers and the rest were placed in the give box. The pile of paper bags was taken to recycling. After everything was on the shelves I still had room for laundry baskets on two of the shelves. The amount of clutter we'd accumulated was impressive but the clear shelves were even more impressive.

By that Monday, I had decided. If the boys were available, I was going to do it. On Monday morning, I called the social worker to find out whether the boys had been returned to their previous foster home. They hadn't. What was going to happen to them? Uncertain. Parental rights had been terminated. They would go to another foster home, but they were having trouble finding a dual placement. They were considering splitting the boys up and placing them separately. I got a huge lump in my throat. Every single snapshot I could bring to mind involved both boys. Not one. They were always, and I mean always, together. All they had was each other.
Clearly I have learned nothing from my first round of illogical thinking. I bend the rod back and forth until it is free. My socks are drenched from walking through the water on the bathroom floor.

I will offer my guests the option to choose their own designer series paper for their Art Journal of course, but I chose mine :). I used more of the Attic Boutique and added a piece from the Pocketful of Posies designer series paper. I cut a piece of thin chipboard with the Label Framelit and adhered the dsp which though it isn't the same color, blends nicely. Then, I sponged it in Crumb Cake and put another Label in Crumb Cake (with embossed polka dots and edged with Dazzling Details) under the R initial from the Timeless Type Alphabet. I went old school on the ribbon because I love these colors and couldn't help but put a ton on it.

They are nasty animals that like to suck the life out of our lovely plants. Their nasty proboscis nose/tongue/mouth part stabs into lovely fruits like lemons, tomatoes, peppers, legumes and sucks out the good stuff. What i'm left with is red tomatoes covered in dimply green/dry spots- sometimes completely dried out on the inside. It is both lame and not tasty. This is another reason that i pick my tomatoes right at blush - get them inside in the safety of the house! Once you've learned to identify the culprit - do all you can to destroy them, or else they will try and destroy you!
I will note this additional finding: my body is capable of SO MUCH MORE than I imagined. I currently go with the methodology of “run for TWO songs, walk for ONE song”. I’ve also been logging my runs as an accountability check on FB. (A few of my times are posted below). For anyone who thinks they cant – YOU MOST CERTAINLY CAN. If I can, so can you!! One day, one step at a time!
We've been waiting for this day for weeks, if not years. Ever since Miguel was a young boy he said he wanted to serve God and go on a mission. This is the day that ends the waiting and wondering....Where will he go? When will he be asked to leave?

In one event so predictably difficult that we called it the Hartford Heartbreak 40 miler, we hit rain, snow, mud, and ice all in one morning. At mile 12 my mare refused to cross a river that swelled overnight to frightening heights for a pony, so I dismounted and entered the water to reassure her. For the next several miles, my cold wet breeches chafed my calves raw. The overnight rain also knocked down trail markers between miles 16 and 22, which meant most of us added an unnecessary loop to climb Heartbreak Hill TWICE.
so far, i haven't let her try in this pregnancy.
A special look back at the U.S. Marines in the Western Pacific, 1944-1945 can be found in Eric Hammel’s Islands of Hell ($50.00, Zenith Press, Quayside Publishing Group.) It is a coffee-table, large format book, 300 pages filled with 567 black/white photos and seven maps that tells the story of the final stepping-stone battles that involved brutal combat in places like Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and finally Okinawa, the doorstep to Japan. The book, just out this month, is released in conjunction with HBOs new mini-series, “The Pacific” and it serves to remind the reader not only of the valor of these now legendary warriors, but of the contrast with today’s conflicts where casualties over a period of years do not begin to compare with those suffered in mere days and weeks in that now long-ago war against the empire of Japan. The text is spare and excellent, but it is the photos that tell the story.

The ones I like least are the standalone "monster of the week" eps. The saving grace of these, I think, is that they serve as breathing points in the pacing, and thereby help the main arc build more slowly and feel bigger. I don't think any of them are completely disposable, and all of them introduce at least one minor development in some relationship between characters, but they usually do so in an incidental way, and it would have been nice if they'd been integrated more tightly with the bigger, broader goings-on.

IT was very hard to watch everyone (those who are not alcoholics) around me be so jovial, holding their alcoholic beverage with such social flair and just having a good ole time! I was really MAD and ANGRY that I couldn't join in on the fun...with the alcohol.
Well, before you know it Shawn is almost to the top of the brick chimney, with nothing holding him except his nerve. He finally makes it to the summit and then just sits on the top. Like a red headed bird on a flagpole, there was little Shawn Gorman way up in the sky, just giving his brothers the finger, and still wearing his roller skates.

You see, every group of young men who binge drink frequently has at least one guy who always pisses himself. Every time they go out. There is always one. You might just have to be that guy. Except, you know, you kicked it up a notch with the pooping. So you can just accept your role in the group and stop worrying about it.

Theirs was a storybook romance told against the shadow of a great American city, until a series of life-changing events threatened more than just their own happiness. Imagine what happens when a single act from a determined man seeking forgiveness and love lost can do to inspire the hearts and minds of a wounded nation.

I came back downstairs, turned on the Garmin, and we were off. There was a light rain for the whole run, but it really felt nice. It was just warm and humid enough, that the rain was more than welcome. It was so nice being out there so early. I don't know when was the last time I ran down Monument Ave and only encountered a handful of cars. We didn't even see any other runners for the longest time. We stayed on Monument until we hit the 1.5 mile mark and then turned to head back. We made a few turns on our way back, so we ended with just over 3 miles. We did 3.39 miles in 34:42. I was even pleasantly surprised to see that we managed negative splits. That doesn't happen too often for me!
I'm bored with football. This might have something to do with the lackluster season the Seahawks are having and some weird coaching decisions they've made (trading Housh?! those challenges two weeks ago?!). It also might have something to do with my moodiness, which has coincided pretty distinctly with the football season. (Blame it on football? Sure, why not.)
Here are some extra batteries for your doppler.
Activision and Treyarch revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 on May 1st. Not that this was a big secret, but at least most of the details of the sequel were managed to be kept hidden very well. I was over at Treyarch earlier in the year on Umbra business, but obviously I’m under such strict NDA’s that I’d probably die in 3 seconds if I’d say something I was not supposed to. I really didnt see any of the game so really, no worries.
The Darjeeling Limited - I like Wes Anderson pretty well, but I'm not sold on this one. I'll see it just for the awesome India scenery (and to see how Anderson portrays the culture), but this could not be a worse time for an Owen Wilson movie. Plus, it's been quite a while since Adrien Brody did anything worthwhile - though this might be just the right project for him. Lots of emo histrionics.
And John Lynch, the chairman of FAIR, admitted to John Dehlin in a Mormon Stories podcast that many commonly-held beliefs of the members are untrue - specifically mentioned are that there were NOT more women than men in the church when they practiced polygamy and that the Masons did not really have the temple ceremony from Solomon's time.

As part of the “Pwnium security challenge”, Google offered to pony up an additional $1 Million in cash to anyone at the Vancouver at the CanSecWest conference who could hack its Chrome browser. This isn’t the first that Google has put out such a self-assured challenge, last year they offered a $20,000 bounty. The code has yet to be cracked. A very bold and clever PR approach to making a very strong security statement – we love it.
Moss rose, or portulaca grandiflora, is another must for my garden. Very low maintenance, and because they are so low-growing, I use them as a ground cover between other plants. I love especially the fact that one plant will yield multicolored blooms. They are considered an annual here, although I have some that come up faithfully year after year.

All in all, not bad for a tiny little country which makes up less than 1% of the world’s habitable land mass and contains less than 1% of the world’s population. No other country in the world can claim to have so consistently been on the right side of good and evil. No other country in the world can claim to have built the modern world. No other country in the world has exerted so much influence over all other countries, as has England.

I talked to my friend Mabel, the travel agent, and she can have you on an overnight flight back home tomorrow. She just needs the address to deliver the ticket. Send it to me, please, honey.
The work I have studied has evoked in me a range of emotions from appreciation of a loving relationship, to shock and near disgust at debauched behaviour. In this respect the artists have probably succeeded in their aim – to provoke a reaction, to make the viewer think. Each viewer of these images brings their own experiences to their perception of what is being shown. The work of these photographers share many common elements but all have been successful in evoking some emotion in the viewer. My personal perception of the scenes I have been shown has forced me, in some ways, to view things differently.

This thought did, however, make me think a lot about business practices. Over the years I dealt with people who I was nearly certain weren’t honest about reporting their income. I am also certain that some of them took inventory for personal use and still reported it as a business expense. And when I changed offices, I had clients that I did not agree to take with me to my new position.
"Sparrow's Flight" is well written and pleasant to read, and the author has done his research well and is to be commended for this. He provides an unusual approach to historical events and although not startling, it's a good book to while away an afternoon.

My birth mother had been born in Germany, but was in the UK when she had me. She was part of an army family and she was one of 6. She was around 21 or 22 when she had me and at that time she already had 2 children a 4 year old boy and an 18 month old girl. The papers also mentioned a husband. They stated that she was 5ft 2ins and had long dark hair and brown eyes. She liked swimming and reading. She had become pregnant with me following a ’brief fling’. Her address was also on the papers.
ENCOURAGE APPLICATION (writing or drawing): Discuss ways to give gifts to the Savior by serving others and showing love to them (see Matthew 25:40).

Jesus, bless him, had absolutely without warning got into the taxi to tell my taxi-driver to come off drugs, because he was an addict and his life was a mess, and the taxi-driver did. Just like that. It was amazing. And now he drives a black Mercedes, which proves it, because before that he was driving a Ford Fiesta. (You see, as I had to work out for myself later when attempting to rationalise this story, it wasn't actually THIS taxi, because at that point the taxi-driver didn't have this one.) I have a feeling that Jesus did a pretty good job, as my taxi-driver seems like a very calm and nice individual.

Pausing only temporarily to cast their healing magic (and in the case of Alagon to use his laying on of hands power) the party pressed on through the gate and into the tower itself, from where they had heard noises which told them that they had not finished off the entire defence force. Before them lay a room with three possible exits – ahead, right and left. The latter led them to a dingy room in which was a filthy pile of straw and some gnawed and bloody bones. To the right was a long vaulted hall at the end of which was an archway through which the party saw two more bugbears coming to investigate the noise of intruders. The bugbears hung back, enticing the party to come to them. Unfortunately, Ferros charged straight through the arch without stopping to wonder why and triggered a flame trap which incinerated the doughty cleric. He had lost a lot of hit points in the battle and was still not up to full; he also failed a save vs Breath and took 4d6 of damage, which reduced him to below -10. That, by my house rules, is permanently Dead.

Adrianna/Austin- Ade goes back to Navid’s to get her lucky shoes and tells him that Austin is her new manager. As mentioned before, Navid tells her he doesn’t trust Austin, and to make sure that Austin is looking out for her and not himself. Austin brings Ade to a surprise meeting with his dad. Austin tells his dad that Ade needs a premiere venue and asks if she can play at one of his shows. Austin’s dad warns Ade about playing in front of his country crowd, and Austin lies and tells him Ade’s been singing country forever. His dad tells Ade she can play his show the next night. After Austin’s dad plays a practice set, Austin tells him that Ade is more than ready. Ade expresses concern and seems nervous about playing. Austin tells her he won’t fail in front of his dad again. Ade tells him he sounds a lot like Dixon, and that working with him was a huge mistake. As mentioned previously, Austin later goes over to Annie’s to try to get her to convince Ade that he’s a good guy.

I remember the horns of this dilemma from what my mother used to say:
Meanwhile for the third class passengers, it was a counter productive lifestyle. It was so noticeable that Titanic was made exclusively for the rich and famous that the atmosphere far below the first class deck was almost like a memorial park. Nothing much was happening in the third class cabins. The women would usually retreat to their cabins after dinner and the men would normally hang out to play poker with cheap liquor by their side. That was as much fun they had. No one was willing to walk on the decks of the ship because it was extremely cold and piercing. Everyone preferred to be tucked in and stayed warm.

This week the Sun moves into Gemini giving everyone a boost of curious interest in practically everything. People will gobble up subjects and ideas like Chiclets. Whether due to weather patterns, or changes happening at school, suddenly, everyone is taking short trips, running around doing errands, and talking to everyone! Yada yada yada. We feel alive! However, there will be a tendency to overbook, and exhibit a cocky confidence that we can do it all. Not me. This weekend, I'm going to finish writing my book, paint the bathroom, clean the backyard, get my carpets steam cleaned, and have everyone over for Sunday brunch. And my first Pole dancing workout is on Saturday afternoon!

Hungry Beast was back in 2010 and it was as inconsistent as ever. When Hungry Beast is great it’s really great, but when it misses the mark it does so with style. 2010 saw the Beast tackle the Internet Filter in what was perhaps the most succinct and clever take down of the whole shemozzle, but it also saw them “delve deeper” into the “dark” underbelly of Google in a much mocked bit that placed all of the Google’s interests into a collage that formed the face of Darth Vader. What other show could be both tech savvy and then episodes later put on their tin foil hat and be paranoid of the big evil internet? No other show. It’s all part of what makes Hungry Beast watchable, if not perfect.
In any event, Grits would rather see newspapers make money from "adult entertainment" than treating news reporting as entertainment, which is another common route some outlets have taken to draw in more readership (though to its credit, mostly not the Morning News). I don't consider voyeurism about gory, personal crime details any more commendable than sexual voyeurism, but newspapers have profited from printing salacious crime details for years. To save the industry, newspaper editors need to get off their high horse, or else fall off, probably into the unemployment line, albeit with their self-righteousness and dignity intact.

But yeah. The joke was mostly taking aim at Sarkozy because I don’t like him. Not on a personal level, as he might be a proper lad – small people with large noses often are – but he always seems like a prick politically. Being snide about the lack of British co-operation with a thing that would do nothing to help Britain was one thing that annoyed me, despite not really being bothered about my own country if I’m honest, but also just having to see his face on the news saying “yeah Angela” was pretty boring too. During his 5 year-until-now (that may still carry on), Sarkozy might as well have been that Angela Merkel woman, since they seem to be married or something. Except they’re not. Bants.

So, I am trying to use up my scraps, so I started with the small square in the right corner...it is a floral pattern that matches the stripes from a Echo Park Springtime paperpack. Since I am using floral papers...She is my flower power gal as challenged by Joanna Sheen. I browsed the challenge blogs to find a sketch that would work and found it at Sketch Saturday. I subsituted the ruffled dark purple for a paper in the sketch, but I like it. I found it a bit challenging to use this sketch, because I made this card into an easel card.

Pop popcorn using your preferred method. I made mine on the stove top, and for this much popcorn you'll want a big pan - a large Dutch oven works well. Place a few tablespoons of canola oil in the pot along with 3 kernels of popcorn then cover the pot and set it over medium to medium-high heat. When those first 3 kernels pop, add the remaining kernels and pop them, shaking the pot occasionally to prevent burning. When the noise of the kernels popping is nearly stopped, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for a minute.

A Chelsea victory could have made the final day of the EPL very interesting with two teams battling for the title and Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle having a good shout for Champions League presence next season. But the race now seems to be between Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle United,out of which only two would make it for the premier football club competition, if Chelsea lose the Champions league finals against Bayern Munich.
In addition to the art and photography you see here on my blog, I have also started to do some digital scrapbooking and making photo books to celebrate milestones and special vacations. When I was given the opportunity to check out a scrapbook software called My Memories Suite I decided to download it and give it a try. I discovered that it's easy to use and I was able to create these two pages quickly and easily. The best part was that I was able to import my own background papers (the top one is a scanned image of one of the ones I recently made using stencils and paints, and the musical notes page was downloaded from Free Vintage Papers blog, a blog that offers free digi-papers and digi-stamps. Look for Pamela's link on the right).
I hosted a little "Intro to Unschooling" a couple weeks ago (coinciding with the James concert because some really amazing unschooling voices were gathered together for that). I gave a little talk about some unschooling basics and then my fellow concert-goers plus Heather and TJ and Frank formed a panel for a nice little Q&A session.
Neither spoke of it but both had been wondering how it would be once they got there. Around home everyone knew each other and even though a lot of changes had been taking place, it was still unspoken that there were “places” and each should keep in mind where those places were. Seldom did you hear anyone say specifically, “You better know you place”, it still was pretty much on the forefront of everyone’s mind. A stroke of the pen doesn’t blot out centuries of lifestyles and habits. The civil rights act had changed a lot of signs and removed just as many, but habits die slowly and hatred seems to simmer forever. Hank and Billy Ray had gone to separate schools during the early years but going into high school the school system had integrated all the county schools and the high school in their area was total consolidation instead of using a government quota arrangement. Other areas of the country had not enjoyed the success as they had with their school. There had been no situations of conflict other than what you would expect from a segregated school. To say there was nothing to adjust to would not be honest, but during their three years of high school together, there had been no conflicts between either of them or any of the other students.
A curious little group of statues down by the harbour, and, just visible, a new venue called the Wave centre, hosting concerts and community events. These things are clear evidence of regeneration, whether they are quite to one's taste or not. Like much of West Cumbria, Maryport has gone though a long decline with prominent high street properties standing empty. Once it was possible to walk clear across the harbour on the decks of the herring boats, an old lady in the nursing-home told me. Those days are long past.

I've learned that just because you don't get to experience the harvest, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. I've learned that God asks us all to play different roles when it comes to His work. We could be the sowers, the person who waters, or the individual who gets to reap the harvest. And here's the best part-every role is equal in importance.
Report 08068 appears on the agenda as an Action Item. As this is the trustees’ first opportunity to read the report, I expect no decision will be made until our June board meeting at the earliest.
I was not expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did. I was hoping for it to be good, the premise sounded interesting enough, the front cover is gorgeous, so it was certainly off to a good start. But this book has a fair amount of humor as well as danger. I wasn’t expecting the two fairy tales to blend together so well, it almost seems like that’s the way they were supposed to be told. I didn’t expect the setting either. I was prepared for a fantasy setting but Haskell places us in a made up country between very real ones, with very real issues. I simply wasn’t expecting to love this book as much as I do, which of course, just makes me love it more!

The person behind the counter offered a speedier resolution. I take out a new contract, a business one, and they would buy out the remainder of my contract - £200. All I'd have to do is wait for a form to be sent out, fill it in, wait for my first bill, and send the two off. 4 weeks after that I'd have a cheque in my hand for £200. Simple.
Wycliffe was also an early advocate for translation of the Bible into the common language. He completed his translation directly from the Vulgate into vernacular English in the year 1382, now known as Wycliffe’s Bible. It is probable that he personally translated the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; and it is possible he translated the entire New Testament, while his associates translated the Old Testament. Wycliffe’s Bible appears to have been completed by 1384, with additional updated versions being done by Wycliffe’s assistant John Purvey and others in 1388 and 1395.

When I worked as a screenwriter for children's television in the 1990s, for the likes of HBO, Paramount, Hanna-Barbera, Alliance-Atlantis and the CBC, I was sometimes called upon to write "bibles" for shows. One of the chapters was usually on the "danger factors" or "violence levels" for the kids at home - or, to put it plainly - could they repeat this at home, and die or kill or wound or injure themselves in the process? Most of the shows I worked on wanted to avoid, at all costs, danger levels that could or might lead to a child being hurt, in any way - and indeed, psychologists worked with writers often, to strike a proper balance. This sort of concern might surprise some industry-watchers, who consider everything aimed at children as cynical or profit-led, when, in fact, and not just to avoid litigation (but that too), quality is often uppermost in the creators' minds.

New words: "Dugobwa" is "just watch"--sorta like, "You wait and see!". "Gachi-ga" is "Let's go together". "Charari" is "instead" or "I'd rather". "Eodi-ga nogoshipeunde?" seems to be "Where do you want to go?" "Eottoke tengoya?" is "What happened?" "Bingeul bingeul" is "around and around" or "spinning".

Undocumented women working on farms across the US are much like the Gibeonites. They are driven from their home countries by their fear and their will to escape crushing poverty.[11] This drive is so strong that they are willing to enter the US illegally in the same way that the Gibeonites were willing to deceive Israel. Both undocumented female farmworkers and the Gibeonites illegitimately occupy land that “rightfully belongs” to others. However, there is a shocking difference between the response of Israel, and Yahweh, and that of the US. When undocumented farm workers cry out for stolen wages, babies deformed from chemicals, and constant sexual abuse, who hears their cries? The response of the US government and citizenry is weak at best and non-existent at worst. Israel honored the illegitimate peace treaty with the Gibeonites and, with Yahweh’s miraculous help, rescued them from their enemies. Undocumented farm workers, especially women, are also under attack; they are desperate for US consumers, churches, and political leaders to look beyond their undocumented status and honor their lives and work.

The second tech asked me how I was doing and I said "Fine" because I wasn't in any physical pain or anything (I mean, is that what she meant? I have no idea.), but I was doing everything I could not to really start crying because I KNEW my baby was failing this test. This second tech gave me some pillows to make me more comfortable, and told me to relax so that the baby had lots of room to move without my abdominal muscles being tense (you know because my ab muscles are so AMAZING that it must be my six pack that's preventing the baby from passing this test). She was super nice, but I had been in that stupid recliner for over an hour and I was so over it.

In addition, the Old Testament is a series of prophetic books that show the reason behind why Christ had to come to earth. It tells of a Messiah rising out of Bethlehem, going into Egypt for hiding and coming out of Nazareth to save His people. It also says that the Messiah would be hung on a tree. Lastly, it tells us that even death and the grave could not hold this Messiah and would return one day to take His people with Him.

Hence the title of this post. I have always said that the goal is to learn a second language as if it was your fourth. But, in reality it will help any English-speaker to develop a practical understanding of some of the classic English structures (particularly around verbs). This will give you a situational understanding that will help you to understand what similarities English shares with your target language, and what the differences are.
A game-changer when it was issued in 1969, Hot-Buttered Soul more or less created the blueprint for the way soul music would develop during the early-to mid seventies. Recorded at Ardent with John Fry behind the console, the songs are mostly extended jams, which seem almost improvised at points. If you are not a fan of soul, give a listen to "Walk on By" or the epic "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" and see if you aren't converted. An absolute classic, and the album that put Ardent on the commercial map.

They blocked each other on Facebook, changed phone numbers, moved on and haven’t spoken since the break-up, but she still dreams about him constantly. Every time she wakes up after a dream, she feels freshly heartbroken. She’s not sure how to find closure, or if she should try to reach out to him.

But don’t for a minute think that this is a fixation from which only white liberals suffer. Listen to those self-professed conservatives calling talk shows who proudly proclaimed, “I would like to see Condoleezza Rice or Colin Powell run for President, so I could vote for them and prove I am not a racist.” Those exact words have been expressed on the airwaves over and over again. In making this proclamation, the callers seem so proud of themselves. These white people consider it perfectly rational to live one’s life in anxiety over how they might be perceived by invisible race monitors. The political ideologue seeks out “our blacks” as opposed to “your blacks.”

"In the depths of my soul, since childhood, a persistent sense that something is missing. More than anything it is this feeling of an absence that has been my most intimate friend. It is the root of my clownish, buffoonish desire to be close to people, to be liked by them, to be of some service to them. It would be no exaggeration to say that this sense of something missing has been what has driven me to where I am today.
My main idea was that I don’t use fire lighters, those little black bricky things or those horrid little green greasy cubes to light my BBQ. I consider them a waste; a waste of time, a waste of resources and they’re expensive.
Well well well, we have found our dataset and it is NOT from Vostok Ice Cores or any other ice core; nor is it just a direct CO2 reading from Vostok. Dr. Bradley, obviously using the same academic integrity he displayed in his “hockey stick’ sham, pasted the Mauna Loa data onto the Vostok Ice Core data to make one impressive looking graph. He of course just didn’t believe it was necessary to reveal that little detail. I examined the properties of Dr. Bradley’s photo and it was last modified on Tuesday, January 20, 2009 2:51:19 PM also known as Barack Obama’s inauguration day. Was someone trying to get attention for a grant or a job?
She placed her palm on his face, his unshaved cheek scraping against her skin and she shivered at the thought of where else his five-o’-clock shadow could scrape her.

It has also been a ton of work, however, and I'm reaching a point where it's time to focus more of my time and attention on creating prints and doing some work of my own. With that said, The Best Part will no longer exist in its current state. While the Blogger platform makes things fairly simple, I'm still spending hours every day finding, editing and publishing links when my focus should really be on creating prints. Which is why I'll be shifting more content to TBP's Facebook and Twitter accounts, allowing me to continue to share the great work I find daily online without the work and pressure of the daily blog. I will also continue to occasionally post to TBPTV, my online library of video content related to all things creative and inspirational. This blog and its archives will remain online as a resource for anyone who might want to find information on the artists featured here over the years.

I think, I am also lucky because my parents have not been traditional Malays, especially my mother who raised me. There was of course some talk of Malay superstition, “don’t sing in the kitchen or you’ll get an old husband” sort of stuff. Of course, I was always singing in the kitchen, and as of yet, have never had a relationship with anyone older than me. Maybe they meant I would get married when I was old, and therefore have an old husband? Mixed with that, there were Western superstitions. My mother would actually turn around if a black cat passed in front of her. This went on until I got my cat Zorro who was really probably the devil incarnate, but after he walked past my mother a few times a day and no evil luck befell her, she gave up that particular superstition. It was an interesting way to grow up, at the very least.
In the beginning, I wrote because it freed me. It freed my mind from all of the stories that clouded my imagination and made it impossible to concentrate on any other task. I grew up in a happy home but I was never truly content unless I was escaping into another world. I don’t even know why that is to be perfectly honest. I played the part of “happy child” but for the most part I wasn’t. I got teased a lot because my parents couldn’t afford all of the name brand clothes the other kids wore – it was hard but it made me strong. Writing was a release for me – was it all good, of course not. Heck, it could be crap now, but that wouldn’t make much of a difference to me because I write for myself.
And here is a quote from it:

I am retelling this story as a way to show the importance of the interconnections of what I do and talk about for Food Empowerment Project. I'm convinced that we are stronger when we work to connect issues of injustice, and when we work together, we can open more minds to fight the oppressors and free the oppressed.
The next few miles were mostly flat or rolling and I really picked up steam and was feeling great! I was completely ignoring my MPM and was just trying to catch people up the road while not letting anyone behind me catch up. I linked up with another runner and we paced well off of each other. She would surge ahead on the downhill’s and I would catch back up on the up hills. With 3 miles left to go I turned on the after burners and jammed as hard as my body could handle. I noticed I almost pushed it too hard because there were a few hills that I felt like I was going to pass out upon reaching the top, luckily I didn’t ha-ha!
sweet, and some bittersweet memories
So nice of you to also reinforce the fact that you think I'm stupid. I know you think I'm wrong, but I'm not dumb. At least concede that I did some damn good research and the symptoms fit. I looked over the equine veterinary manual sitting on my bookshelf a hundred times, trying to narrow down what it could be. Every option I have shown you (the most likely and fitting of which is laminitis) you have shot down like a clay pidgeon. What do you think it's going to be, PO? Magic? Cause there are only so many possible diagnoses and you've shot down all of them.

-A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving.
For the past three weeks at Repurposed, you've been led into the ugly, abandoned building of suffering. And while five interviews provided a window into the lives of ordinary men and women, I'm convinced many of you are doing more than peering through the glass. Several of you have been cut by its jagged edges and could tell similar stories. That's why I describe it as ugly. And abandoned. It's never easy to read a story of brokenness and know that you could be writing it, too.
I have tons to catch up on and to prepare for next week….but I’m going to catch up on all your blogs this weekend (being without internet SUCKS!). Director wants to read a book together-I think she saw how much fun Parker and I had, and we’ve picked The Stand. Looking forward to that….
And in a subsequent scene, the nine-year-old heroine has just realized what the desire of her life is to be, and runs through a long, curving passageway, another classic symbol of transition and birth, but the scene is filmed as an endless following shot in the psychedelically orange gateways of the Fushimi Inari shrine (just click through and look!), and truly delivers on the sensation of transformation that the moment is.
At the same time I’m hearing and seeing talks from males that they want a “submissive” lady friend. Answer me this gentleman: Do you really expect the woman who chased you to be submissive once you’re in the relationship? To the assertive/aggressive ladies: How do you feel when you are doing the chase? Especially, when the feelings are not being reciprocated? Please and thank you.
My heart warmed at the words. . On the way back from the village where I was sent to investigate the killings, miles away where the woods began, I had found her huddled like a bundle among the trees.

Some of my fellow clergy who share my understanding of God's will have already decided to leave the Church of Scotland. Others are still thinking they may well do so. I'm not going anywhere. My dad, his brother, my mum's uncle and his uncle before him were CofS ministers. Perhaps that's got something to do with my desire to stay, I don't know. But I don't feel God's leading to leave. Nor does Him Indoors. So we're staying.

Graham Badman arrived at the group with his minder from the DfCSF and spoke to the parents, many of whom expressed strong opinions about what their children wanted. At one point, he wandered off while his sidekick was harangued by the parents. It was then noticed that he was asking the views of the children themselves. Horrors, there was no telling what the kids would say to him! In fact he was asking them about how they viewed home education. One child said that she wanted to be a vet and Badman asked whether she had any idea about what qualifications she would need to fulfil this ambition. Everything was very amicable and the children were enjoying being given the chance to express their own views. This ended as soon as some parents saw what was happening. They charged up and ’rescued’ their children. The kids were given the impression that they had narrowly escaped being grabbed by the child-catcher and the overall feeling generated was that this was some sort of stranger danger. So agitated were the parents, that a couple of the children became upset. They did not know what was happening or what they had done wrong. That was the end of Badman actually being able to listen to the views of any home educated children that day; it was made clear to him that the children’s views should be transmitted by the parents and not taken directly from the kids themselves.

Pause lock is when you can lock the iPod while it’s playing music to keep from any buttons being accidentally pressed. To do this simply hold down the play/pause button for three seconds. You will hear a click and then a light at the top will flash indicating the iPod is now in pause lock. To unlock your iPod hold down the play/pause button again for three seconds and the iPod Shuffle will flash another light at the top along with a single click sound. Now all the buttons on the iPod will work and you will be able to change music tracks or adjust the volume again.
Having said all of that, I am still thankful for the life that I have. God uses me blesses me, but my life is nothing to envy.

Apparently you can't say you're going to donate your earnings to charity, but you also can't say that you're not going to say you're going to donate your earnings to charity. I did get a very helpful (and by "helpful", I mean "lame" letter that didn't really explain anything to me. I wrote back to eBay to see just what their problem was and received the following wonderful answer to my question. Don't you just love companies who don't take the time to address your questions and instead send you autoresponders? Autoresponders that pretty much say, "We're not going to answer your question. Do not respond to this letter. We don't really care about your question. Buh-bye." This is really not a complaint specifically about eBay, but against every company who sadly lacks in the customer service department. I honestly don't have anything against eBay. I mean, if it weren't for my auction last year, I wouldn't be where I am right now. That said, I abhor stinky customer service from any company.

It has worked great to have them sleeping in one room and have the toys in the other room. Late this summer he asked if he could have his own room again. We decided this was a good decision and so for Rex's birthday we promised him a new bedroom of his own. This simple project has turned into the longest small project ever. We painted, pulled the trim and repainted that and Justin refinished the hardwood floors. It has all turned out really well. Rex picked a silvery gray color for the walls and I painted the ceiling dark gray. We trimmed it in white and a light finish on the floors. All in all I think it looks great. My mom hooked us up with curtains. Rex decided he wanted Washington State University cougars for his curtains and Gramma gave him a great cougar blanket for his birthday. He is in heaven!
Off I went to class….part of this torture was jumping rope for three minutes!!! My thighs were screaming, as was my bladder, having had two babies who used it as a trampoline when they were in my tummy!!

I thought that since it was Monday and I wasn’t feeling particularly creative, I’d have a guest blogger for the day. You might have heard of him. He’s King David, best known for writing a few songs we call Psalms. Here goes:
This article doesn't get into the the ins and outs of organization governed communities, industry managed communities, or self-selected participatory communities. However, if I managed the community, my ninjas would have taken him out a long time ago.

Heavily sculpted solder, washed in the worn and rusted hues of weathered iron, frame the plethora of radiant crystals which form the petite French Alisee cross. It is beautifully apparent that the crystals have been cut to catch and refract as much light possible by the confetti of color which is thrown when light washes across the faceted crystal surfaces. The rustic yet refined cross crowns a patinaed bottle of embossed glass which reads, "SMITH & DALTON DRUGGISTS SYRACUSE N.Y." -- an ethereal veil of patina graces the inside of the bottle -- a reminder of the many decades spent buried and hidden away underground
In Nouadhibou itself, activists protested outside the Moroccan consulate for two hours against remarks made by one of their delegation which suggested Mauritania was a vassal of the Moroccan state.

These treats were mere precursors to the main event – or, more accurately, events – as the confit duck with braised red cabbage arrived hand-in-hand with Mac’s Sassy Red representing the New Zealand arm of Lion Nathan and therefore NOT featured in The Critics’ Choice but worthy of inclusion if a Kiwi version is commissioned.

Four girls. One dead body. A whole lot of guilt.
However, what I do have a problem with is that I received an email from them yesterday telling me that they were going to be supporting an Obama super PAC called "Priorities USA". What??!! Excuse me??!! I typically just delete these emails, but I after reading the subject - "We will not play by two sets of rules" - I knew exactly what they were going to say. The person whom the email was supposedly from was "Obama for America" campaign manager, Jim Messina. Messina basically spends the first of the email explaining about the awful decision (which I fully agree) in Citizens United, and how Republicans have been raising and spending massive amounts of super PAC money. And how the majority of that money spent has been on negative ads, and that Republicans are looking to raise about half a billion dollars in super PAC money before this election is over.

1. Nominating and recognizing an ‘employee of the month’. Senior Managers can recommend those employees who have performed well during the month and the selection of one or two eligible employees. A plaque or medal could be given to the winning employee with a certificate of recognition. This could be made into a yearly award as well, considering the type of business. This method of recognition is a preferred morale booster in most companies and in the hospitality trade.

What is precipitously teetering in the balance at this point, during weeks marked by inaction and duck-and-cover from our designated leaders is, well, confidence.
For if we took an interest I am certain that we’d find,
I've gone for a vintage look by choosing some gorgeous striped DP from Graphic45 ... the Christmas Emporium collection ... love the muted creams and browns ... and I've teamed it up with a stunning lace/velvet trim from Anna Griffin. You can just about see that there's some script stamped down the left side of the paper.
Did you ever live with a piece of furniture that you really don't like for a very long time and then all of a sudden...on a whim...you want to transform it. Well, that's the story of a coffee table in our family room.

well little did we know how extremely hard the actual brass portion that fastens to the door is to find. We found tons of knobs, but actual brass pieces = near impossible. My sister in law took me to this huge antique store and after several hours I found two beautiful brass pieces
I just bought a straw purse from Forever 21 with a little bit of neon yellow along the edges. I also got a pair of earrings with just a bit of the yellow on the edges, and everyone knows how I'm a nail polish addict, so of course, I've got neon nails too :)

Because that’s what it all boils down to.

When the reality-reversing diversity-enforcing psychopaths at Amerika's newspaper of record are not defending black murderers or attacking the Catholic Church or promoting gay marriage or advocating for the Great Erasure or attempting to prove their anti-racist bona fides by providing a platform for minority plagiarists, their attempts to buff the halo of moral superiority atop their pointy heads are never-ending in virtually every other field of publishing endeavour. As we have seen. Ad nauseum.

Call the police, I thought... but a moment later, realized the futility of that idea-- the woman was leaving. She would be in the parking lot in 10 seconds. No way would she still be around by the time police arrived.

Furthermore DLC is done on a separate budget from the regular game by a smaller team which means that yes the DLC costs money, it was put on the Collector’s Edition as a bonus and the cost was probably fitted into the overall cost for the Collector’s Edition. It probably was originally a Collector’s Edition exclusive, but because of how fast the Collector’s Edition sold they decided to give it to everyone else, for a price.

I already know that I do need personal time. Constant mingling does indeed wear me down. I come home from a party where I don’t know anyone almost exhausted. However, I could do a little more to meet new people. I will need to prepare myself a little better next time I travel though. I’ll need to make sure I have the energy to try to connect, or at least be open to connecting.

In a matter of moments, Oliver proved O’Donnell’s point and stumbled over questions about his “close pal”‘ causing O’Donnell to shut him down saying, “You don’t even have a consistent story. You’ve told us you don’t know what his mistakes were; then you tell us he grew from them. There’s so much you don’t know, Joe.”
“That sort of thing is helpful, too, actually. Some companies don’t look well on their executives making a spectacle of themselves.”
Monday I ran nine miles while we were at my parents' house. Usually I run around their area, weaving in and out of neighborhoods, but I just couldn't stomach the thought of all that weaving. So I opted to run on the busier streets. I think I preferred it, but it sure as heck took quite a while to get through all the intersections. I also took a walk break shortly after the 8th mile. Ended up finishing with a 9:16 pace.
DALLAS - Another new craft brewery called Deep Ellum Brewing Company is in the late development and planning stages for the Deep Ellum entertainment district of east Dallas.
Still on the lighter side of things, but more my style, is the fine Headless Man Amber Alt. This eminently drinkable brew strikes a fine malt-hop balance and finishes clean and smooth, with a pleasing caramel sweetness. The Stone Tepee Pale Ale is a nice example of an American pale, with plenty of juicy citrus hop flavor and aroma, dry finish, but a more subdued bittering than the IPA.
It is different than any other phone. As HTC ceo admitted, when they saw iPhone for the first time they couldnt believe it was an actual phone. This illustrate how visionary leadership of Steve Jobs was.

“This situation is not easy on anybody involved, but I can only hope that everyone can look into their hearts and listen to the real facts about my dad, because I truly don’t know what I would do without him in my life,” she said, crying as she spoke.
As for my own weight loss, I’m down about 2kg so far which isn’t too bad, especially as I’ve just had two weeks overseas. Anybody who’s travelled knows how bad trips are when you’re trying to lose weight and make positive lifestyle changes. But I’m back with a vengeance and looking forward to watching our collective weight loss creep up towards the 1000kg mark.

O Courtney Cox, you were my favorite Friend; now with lip all ducky and face glowing like a luminous nerve toxin mask and your character foolishly yoked to David Arquette's ever-wincing and criminally incompetent sheriff, yours truly art a SCREAM 4 for the Munch. Just as the ghostface killa mask is frozen in a 'Scream' so is your once gorgeous face frozen in a world you never made, and which you haunt in a shadow state like that other memorable Munch painting, Madonna.
But this sort of random thing kind of has me stumped. So I looked up the meaning of sunflowers. I found adoration and loyalty. That's kind of nice Somebody adores me? That's sweet. I adore somebody? Absolutely. I'm loyal? To a fault. People are loyal to me? I certainly hope so.

In the Telegraph, she proclaimed as fact (rather than highly contested speculation) that there were female priests and even bishops in the early Christian church. In the Guardian yesterday she claimed that Theodora, wife of the Byzantine emperor Justinian, was largely responsible for the legal reforms named after her husband. She "incarnated the Biblical understand of wisdom as the ability to make sound judgements" and ruled "with wisdom's lilies woven through her crown." This is, shall we say, a partial description of her known character. Hughes also celebrates the little-known (in the West) 7th century Chinese Empress Wu Zetian:

From a very pedestrian viewpoint, The Runaways were a scruffy chick rock L.A. version of that original pre-fab/anti-fab combo, the Sex Pistols, aimed at a fucked up demographic by a nutcase impresario, Kim Fowley. But then there's the 'enlightened' viewpoint which was like whoa, these chicks rawk! Kind of confused about whether its a tired meditation on dues, fame and girly girls, ala LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE FABULOUS STAINS, or drugs and excess, like ROCK STAR, the RUNAWAYS has a little of both: lots of dues-paying, the girls deflecting tossed beer cans with their guitar necks, dealing with small hotel rooms, blossoming lesbianism, and Cherie's terrible music tastes in the car. Little things that add up to an uneasy feeling, like CROSSROADS and GLITTER welded to the aesthetic of Oliver Stones' THE DOORS while aiming for the loose goosey 70s kids are all right vibe of OVER THE EDGE (1979), which is still the greatest kids amok film after all these years!
This year, Boston has been selected, and while today will see the official commemoration, led by Mr Higgins, a whole series of events will take place throughout the year.
Having lived in a high-rise condo for over 9 years now and being active as a committee and board member over the years, I can relate to the importance of communication within a community.
Now girls at school are pouring out their sympathy to me. Guys too. But not everyone’s on my side. The school has become a war zone and the threats are getting scary.

Another thing I recommend is that you show your customer’s that you have liability insurance. Not only does this put their mind at ease on letting you do work on their current system but it also helps explain why your cost may be higher than ABC Air down the street. (if your company name is ABC Air I promise I am not trying to single you out).
Page 234's reference to the Sistine Chapel is equally puzzling. We are told British woman calls in on a radio program to say that she is "gobsmacked by the volume of holiday decoration here in the states" (I sincerely doubt a British woman used the euphemistic and inaccurate term "holiday") - "If you ask me", she says, "the whole thing is a waste of electricity". One would expect Judith to be right on board with this - but instead, she says "if you ask me, the Sistine Chapel ceiling is a waste of paint".

Let’s take a look at bin Laden’s pathetic brood to figure out why this is so. I hope it goes without saying that polygamy is absolutely, completely, and undeniably disgusting. I can't think of a worse type of relationship. It tells women that you're not really special. You're here to perform a role, which is basically a sexual one. You're not here to be a confidante or a friend, because I can't treat you any differently from any of the other wives. So I'm just going to use you.

Orbon is indeed a veteran: she has form in the broad field of who-jumped-naked-on-whom – probably useful to have in this case – and has been angling for her own Hate Unit for some time. Whether she was behind the disgraceful leak of a ‘DNA link’ between Strauss-Kahn and Diallo is hard to tell: but she will know as well as Brafman that, in the end, forensics won’t drive this case. The verdict will be based on ‘he said, she said’ as to whether the alleged sex act was forced or consensual. And thus the key strategy on both sides will be to rubbish the character of the other’s client.
"It’s a lovely view". Says Christine.

Went again to 'Miros', my fav Spanish Tapas place on Liverpool Street in the CBD..their chorizos in caramelised apple is highly recommended...also went to 'The Red Door' bar again with a friend after for desserts..another intimate hidden underground place suited for intimate cosy conversations with friends..really nice:) Visited a couple of art galleries and explored the Potts Point/Kings Cross/darlinghurst area during Art Month Sydney and enjoyed re-exploring the Potts Point area.. Met up with a high school friend of mine from Melbourne (and currently residing in Munich with her partner) and took her out to Surry Hill's Monkey Magic for a nice catchup dinner..was fantastic catching up on our lives since 1 yr ago when i visited Melbourne and caught up with her and other Yr 12 friends of ours..i also discovered Sydney's best kept off the beaten track 'treasure' being this underground 'longest travellator in Australia' i swear! So cool..hidden and connecting an underground carpark to an exit coming out in the middle of a park...the travellator's walls are painted with imagery as well!!

In the chaos of the internet, I missed Matthias Stork's response to critics of his video essay on Chaos Cinema, posted at Press Play back in December as "Chaos Cinema, Part III" (with the other two helpfully embedded on the same page).

I decided on a fairly simple card, but it is using a few things that will be/are retired now! The crimper, which I am going to miss because it really gives you a nice little bit of texture when you need it. The stamp set mixed bunch which was in the occasions mini is done now...maybe it will show up in the annual catalogue, which would be awesome becuase I love this stamp set (and the coordinating punch)! And also the sentiment is from Smarty Pants which will be retiring at the end of May!
We went and worked out yesterday evening. Well, Stephanie and I did. Christi started having some serious back pain, so she stayed home. Somehow, I managed to lose over three pounds over the weekend! I don’t get that. I know we didn’t eat much, but that just doesn’t make sense. But it puts me in a great place for Wednesday’s weigh in for the “Biggest Loser” challenge!
