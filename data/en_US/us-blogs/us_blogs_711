Whereas the Catholic sees that sin, corruption, graft was present even within the Apostles, and that sin is not something to be scandalized over, but rather something to be constantly on guard against, the Protestant pretends that the presence of sin within the institutional Church damns and blasts the entirety thereof. I love it, Christ was NOT scandalized by sinners, “tax collectors, prostitutes,” and he was and is the Son of God. But the dainty, scrupulous, pure as the driven snow Protestant chooses to be scandalized by behavior that Christ himself was not. Christ wasn’t scandalized to be seen in the ranks of the “sinner,” but some Protestants are scandalized to be shoulder to shoulder with Ratzinger, a Wojtyla, a Cardinal Newman, a George Cardinal Pell.
But enough of that shameless plug. My putting that up means that I’m mostly done coding the story part of Turtles all the Way: A Shell Game (I’ll actually put the individual scenes together some other time, and any cutscenes that opt to be 3D instead will need to be coded differently…).
For years, I couldn’t see the gifts that my own parents gave to me. What I considered to be their “defects” just seemed too big. My parents are both now well into their 80′s (my father will be 87 in May), and when I told them that Matt had realized a dream; to be filming on the Deadliest Catch, they both said, “How great! I am so proud of him!” Neither said anything about safety or caution or questioned whether or not he was up to it.

We headed back home, fed the kids snack, and relaxed for the rest of the day. Captain America and the kids played a few battlefield games, and I worked on some designing for a while. And we watched a few movies. And around 8pm, we put the kids to bed.

It may be time for a clutter intervention.
In this case, the brand's core values appear to have fluctuated violently over a few short weeks of intensive, indeed intrusive, media attention. The 33 miners, first thought to be irretrievably lost, were then reckoned to be subject of a long-term rescue that would leave them in (for most of us) unimaginable discomfort for half a year while a by-no-means-guaranteed rescue was planned and executed. From victims they morphed into heroes as their spirited and positive attitude towards their predicament shone from the suffocating dark and illuminated our own worlds. More recently, it was the seedier side of a Chilean miner's life which riveted the world's attention, as mistresses have combined or battled with lawful spouses in the battle for their bodies and their souls. Trapped, in more senses than one, Los 33 were in no position to explain, to deny, to apologize, or engage in whatever domestic damage limitation is practised to the West of the Andes.
But! I love the culture here! And the opportunity we have to literally live it! I have learned so much as a missionary and am so grateful for this opportunity I have to be here and to be serving as a missionary. I have learned so much about this Gospel and have seen so many things and am beginning to see how I want to raise my family what works and more of what doesn’t work. I am reading right now our heritage, the history of the church since its beginning and it is so amazing. I am literally blown away at the willingness and sacrifices that the early pioneers made to follow the prophet and do what God wanted. It makes me so thankful to them for all that they did. And I get frustrated sometimes with the members now days who won’t even make the tiniest sacrifice to attend church. (maybe it is walk an extra 3 blocks to church, or not work on Sunday, or pay a full tithe) sometimes people don’t realize truly the great blessing we have in this gospel. And then on the other side there are people that are sacrificing almost everything to be a part of this Gospel. They gave up their family traditions to join the church, or there is a lady Mama Rosa we call her. (I attached a photo) she lives so far away from the chapel, but she attends every week, she is like 84 and still kickin it. She was one of the first members here in Teculutan and has been a faithful member for over 30 years. She is the cutest old lady, she could be chewing me out and telling how horrible I am, and after I would just want to hug her. She is the greatest. Oh and she doesn’t have teeth. Ok I just got sidetracked but many times reading the book I was asking myself if I really had that kind of faith to drop everything and follow the commandments of the prophet, or to drop everything and go west. What would I do in that circumstance, I hope I would obey? Ask yourself what would you do? well guess what we still have a prophet, and we still have commandments, it may not seem as drastic as moving west over 2000 miles, but we still have to test our faith, and it is in with the little things. Do we have the faith to obey the gospel with the little things? To follow the prophets guidance and counsel over the years? Ask yourself that, and then look into your lives and see if there is something that you can improve or change. I did it, and it is
Just like many wedding traditions you can tweak it to make it what you want it to be or forget it altogether. I wouldn’t tell anyone that they have to give a gift. A gift is something they should want to give and can afford to give.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) decided that these are “extraordinary” circumstances. “His record reveals that he believes the Constitution is a fluid, evolving document with no fixed meaning.” (Sessions might like to keep only white, male property owners as voters and retain control over slaves.) Sen. John Corbin (R-TX) objected to Liu because he “would use his position as a federal judge to advocate his ideological theories and undermine well-settled principles of the . . . Constitution.” (Sounds to me like the approach that Supreme Court Justices John Robert and Samuel Alito use.) Sen. Dick Durbin (R-IL) was more blatant in their objection to Liu. According to Durbin, No. 2 Senate Democrat, Republicans are just keeping judicial vacancies available, hoping that a Republican is elected president in 2012. (At least he’s honest about it!)

Hong Kong can have a first-mover advantage in IP trade. Hong Kong has a rule of law, attractive tax system, with a bilingual work force, and is not a gate-to-China, but is part of China. Hong Kong has to take the initiative and make it blaze its own trail. Shenzhen already has a trade platform, but just a website and they seem not very active, they do not have an international nor a holistic approach to the trade platform. China each province has its own platform. In Hong Kong there are more professionals.

The game begins with three healers arriving in a town, a backwards settlement built on a meat industry out in the barren earth of the Russian steppes. The year is… about 1910, maybe. The three healers do not know each other, and arrive in town via different paths and come for different reasons. One of the healers is a dashing doctor from the city, another is a musclebound shamanistic figure. The last is a tiny girl with fearsome messianical powers. They are the Bachelor, the Haruspicus and the Devotress. They’re also your playable characters.

I have not now a lame limb about me, notwithstanding it all. I have been able to endure the hardest kind of manual labor, exposures, hardships, and journeys. I have walked forty, fifty, and, on one occasion, sixty miles in a single day. The only inconvenience I am now conscious of is that if I overwork, or take a severe cold, I feel it more sensibly in my breast and left side than I did before my last injury. I have given considerable space in recounting the foregoing peculiar circumstances which I have experienced in life. A summary of what is here given may be briefly stated thus : I have broken both legs, one of them in two places; both arms, both ankles, my breastbone, and three ribs; I have been scalded, frozen, and drowned; I have been in two water wheels while turning under a full head; I have passed through a score of other hairbreadth escapes. The repeated deliverances from all these remarkable dangers I ascribe to the mercies of my Heavenly Father. In recalling them to mind I always feel impressed to render the gratitude of my heart, with thanksgiving and joy, to the Lord. I pray that the remainder of my days may pass in His service, in the building up of His kingdom.”

A couple of months ago, I was actually talking to a fellow who works for Warner Archive, and I asked him what the status of the title was, mentioning how many inquiries I get here at Space: 1970. I wasn't allowed to pass it along at the time, but I was told that Warner Home Video was considering offering it as a traditional retail package instead of as a manufacture-on-demand Archive product. They just hadn't decided yet which format was the most economical.

My sleep-deprivation and hypoglycemia were only aggravated by a string of rude and demanding customers - one guy didn't like the shape of his burger patty, a kid threw a fish stick at my head, some snobby lady made fun of my gaudy, oversized work uniform and I was verbally molested more times than I could count. In light of all of this, I was overjoyed to see a friendly-looking old man come in and seat himself in one of the booths.

What followed was a rearranging of everything I knew. On one level, I call the injury “karma fast forward”, where I was challenged to let go of that which no longer served and had to learn to absolutely trust a higher power for everything. When you realize that you may never walk again, may never even do the simplest things that we take for granted, your ego crashes and dies while something else is born. For me, what was being born was whatever that whale wanted me to become. It was all about the whale.
I first met Chris and Ian at the Local Food Mapping Workshop in Southampton in June 2011. That was an excellent event as well, but I haven't got time to write about it here. If you're interested, the output from that is available here. Funnily enough, I met them again the following day, as they were co-hosting the Open Data Masterclass at the University of Reading, in conjunction with various partners, including ESRI and the University of Nottingham. Nice chaps that they are, they even gave me a lift back to Eastleigh afterwards. I was really pleased to hear Chris say at the SLA event that they'll be running some more masterclasses this year.
Serving as the album’s executive producer, Madge calls on some of the top names in dance music to bring the beats and the result is a much heavier sounding disc than Confessions, but laced with enough pop influences to give her some decent crossover appeal. While her co-productions with tech-house superstar Benny Benassi (“Girl Gone Wild” and”I’m Addicted”) work well, it’s actually her work with Ray of Light collaborator William Orbit (“Gang Bang” and “Some Girls”) that stands out here, especially with the harder-edged beats and synth lines that Mr. Orbit drops all over these tracks.

If you bounce the Islam taboo of Prokopia you get what NRK has just dished out to Gates of Vienna and its readers, as well as to those of other counterjihad blogs. But that’s the lightest sanction. You may be hauled to court as happened to Islam offenders from Brigitte Bardot to Oriana Fallaci to Geert Wilders to Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff, or you are summoned before a tribunal like Mark Steyn and Ezra Levant, or you are fired from your job as happened to Jean-Claude Barreau already in 1991, to Thilo Sarrazin and to countless others, or you become an Enemy of the People as happened unofficially to Bruce Bawer, and semi-officially to Fjordman. The depth of depravity of the demented Progressive state is such that the Norwegian establishment has practically excommunicated and expelled Peder Jensen, a valuable, brilliant, native Norwegian from his homeland.

But if you follow the trail of the story it was originally an Akkadian Tale, and in Akkadian the word Babel translates as Bab = Gateway El = God.

Those latest were an example of how ridiculous the “Reality” syndication has gotten. The American people are so bored that they base their work schedules, household chores and sleep-times on these false depictions of other families and their issues of love, lust, failure and total y of a family. And because of this, the networks are taking full advantage of boob-tube aficionados lack of exploratory learning that they are pumping out reality shows whichever way you look. The networks have gone so extreme within their false sense of reality, that they have seceded to showing wars on meter maids, wars on hog tying and “real” life families or friends living together attempting to live a life of self-prophecy and of pure laziness and self-absorption. What these networks are actually doing, if you think about it, is trying to show the normal everyday working class of America that even washed-up and current famous people have their own family and life problems. when in reality those families and friends have attempted and failed at making it into the stardom role through natural talent, and what better way to get into that role then to show what every American wants to see; An individual who cries and whines about every little thing, an individual (mostly the teens and early adulthood ones) that is hand-fed their financial success, and degenerative excuses for why their lives are so difficult.
He discussed the logistics of the surgery, how he will unhook the band, and reposition it after fixing the hernia. He will suture it in a higher location than it is now, creating a smaller pouch.

I am so restless today, it is driving me insane! I just want to be ALL of the things! but I can’t can I? It’s like when you are born, no when you are that one cell you have infitate possiblites . Then as you begin to develop you lose some – being a boy or girl, then you lose more and more until the day you die. its so sad. But so cool man, like i don’t even know anymore. damn, what was I saying? right okay I was saying that we lose out of possiblilties as we grow up, we make decisons that shorten our options. Everyone thinks its the other way round, they say that you get more oportunities as you grow up, then they start to decrease as you get old and die. I see it like a linear graph, to my parents it seem to be a upside down parbola, or maybe a inversly proportiante graph – i don’t know, im not good at math. Either way, I had to spend my day looking at my future options – Yay for impending final exams and applying to university. Im scared. Im not scared about growing up, I’m scared I wont. I just want to leave and be on my own, getting out of highschool is my only way – I can’t wait for the day I walk out and never look back.I told my parents I want to travel for uni, they think its because the course I want is elsewhere, in truth it is, but really, I would take any offer just to get out. Im running out of options and I’m running out of time, before I lose out all together. I know this is jumbly and makes no sense, I ran out of my happy energy a while back. It just stops and makes you think, and think and think. Till eventually you are to scared to move because life is to fast, and you can’t keep up.

Laurelwood Brewery had a PBS camera crew in their brewery last week filming a new PBS television series. The new show , “Harvest,” is dedicated to food and travel hosted by chef Eric Ripert of the Le Bernardin restaurant in New York City. Set to debut this November, “Harvest” will explore indigenous products, seasonal ingredients and personalities in a variety of locations around the world. A leading proponent of organic foods, Ripert will travel the globe in search of the best organic ingredients, which he will incorporate into a variety of recipes. Fred Eckhardt was on hand talking about organic beer and cheese pairings. The camera crew also went over to Higgins Restaurant and Bar ( 1239 SW Broadway, PDX #503.222.9070 ) to film more on the Chef's Collaborative (www.portlandcc.org) with Greg Higgins.

And then wham! it's 2 days before palm sunday and i finally pull up the instructions for the garden and read that the wheat berries should be planted at least by palm sunday. So, i load up my 4 kids, (1 still in their pjs) and head to walmart to find some dirt. The rest was so easy and the kids have loved watering it each day. Today, we read the crucifixion story, made a stick cross, put a playmobile jesus inside the tomb and covered it with a large rock. Anyway, i guess i'm learning that its better to do something than to just quit if i can't get it together to do everything.
In 2009, with the stagnation of activities in Barking and Dagenham, I asked the Chairman to reinstate me as the Barking and Dagenham Organiser. Even so, it took an unbelievable five months of time wasting and petty discussions for me to be given the post again! I formulated a campaign which this time had the necessary number of candidates that would allow for two thirds coverage which would have given us control of the council had they been elected. Notwithstanding, this was all left to the last minute, because I didn’t have access to the Barking and Dagenham membership list and previous election canvassing sheets. The campaign was run in only five months! In this time we had to leaflet the whole borough five times over and partially canvass it. Having said that, the glitches in the campaign itself made no difference, because what I did not predict was the amount of corruption that went on during the election with each Labour councillor getting an additional 1000 or more votes on top of what they had attained 2006!
Well then again, maybe I have invested so much in this relationship, it came to a point that I’ve expected so much from you too. I expected you’d give me the benefit of the doubt and the faith that I can never do anything against you. Yes my inner demon is monstrous, too compelling and too strong to resist. But never did it occurred to me to let it shadow my connection to the people I care the most. Hell, I would never let it shadow ours. So now, let me ask you, does it hurt so much to do the same for me? That maybe a ridiculous question, but does it?
Perfectly stated. It is also a shame that most presenters simply present a case study as the end but fail to examine the how of the case study. They don't point out the learning but simply recount what happened. A shame really because as you point out, what happened isn't the good stuff...the good stuff is why the company did what it did and a conversation/examination of the "What" including discussion about what else the company might have done to achieve similar or even better results.

Thankfully, Ishii's bizarre trademarks rupture the film's surface now and then like welcome blisters. An old woman's wonderful facial scar (or is it a tattoo?) is a classic touch. Also true to Ishii is a bloody brilliant scene in which our hero saves a woman from vomiting on her own blood by deep kissing her and sucking the blood from her throat. It's super erotic, loving, and grotesque at the same time. I was in heaven!

I think a lot Christians have the feeling that the resurrection life will be a never ending worship service. Let me be honest with you. I am a pastor, and that thought does not excite me. Don’t get me wrong, I love to worship the Lord with other believers. But I also love to fish, to hike and come around the corner of ridge to a new vista I’ve never seen before. I love to just hang out and laugh with my family and close friends. I like to write, and read and experience moving stories. I believe amazing worship will be part of our experience of resurrection life. But I think there will also be so much more.

When people think Alaska, “hurricane” is not the first word to spring to mind. Maybe “earthquake” or “wild animals eating one’s garbage” or even “cold, miserable, dark wasteland on the tundra” though I’m just speculating, of course. Mother Nature threw us a curve ball yet again last Saturday, blowing in an unseasonal, warm(ish) wind from the south. Not a gentle wind, mind you. I’m not opposed to a little gentle wind as long as it gives a little body to my limp mane. This Chinook wind took things to extreme.

Day seven was my juice fast day, but it's really more like a juice FEAST day. I think it went really well for my first fast. I thought I would feel uber hungry all day and be miserable, but I felt fine and I didn't really notice a difference in my energy level. I did feel really cold though and I had trouble warming up. It was definitely below zero that day, and the bookstore where i work is freezing! I wish I had a mini space heater to bring with me.

It’s true, I was more possessed by the spirit of wonder and joy in those days. I could afford to be, living in that idyllic bubble in that small college town in the middle of a flatlands nowhere, surrounded by adoring fans of music I didn’t even know I had within me. Women, for the first time in my life, to quote the old Rogers and Hammerstein’s song, saw me as “Something Wonderful.” Surprisingly, they even wanted to fuck me! Almost everything I attempted, worked.
I think Arthur realises how lucky he was that someone like Jamila fell in love with him. Deep down he still feels he didn't deserve her, and perhaps that's why, following her death, he couldn't stop blaming himself. She'd tried to get him to leave the order, knights weren't meant to marry let alone have children, but he always thought he'd just do the next mission, then quit.
Yet cliterodectomy either is an abomination or it isn’t. It can’t be a case of its being an abomination in Islington’s lecturers’ district and yet be OK in Timbuktu or even in Sparkbrook or Blackburn. That would be racism.
This is of course the maturation of a child. They are organizing their world, and this new found sense of external order is internalized within the child. As their confidence in their decision making grows so too does their ability to work independently. How can a child choose work if they lack confidence in their ability to decide which work to select? Therefore, instructing a wandering 4 year old who has not had much experience in making decisions and bearing the consequences of those decisions to find their own work will ultimately result in the utterance of the phrase I quoted earlier, “I don't know which work to choose.” This, then, is a very honest statement.

Other hobbies of mine consist of reading both fictional and non fictional books - they keep you sharp and on the ball.
The White Panda and I share a heritage. We’re all Chi-Town boys, We also have an ear for music. Unlike me, however, they also have an ability to create it and hear it in a way that I’m unable. With that skill, they created one of the most unlikely combinations I’ve heard: They mashed the track with Rolling in the Deep by Adele. No meaning besides a… good feeling… was meant to be felt with this mashup. Adele has power in her lyrics and voice, Levels has power in it’s can’t-keep-sitting-while-this-song-is-on feel. Two opposing forces combined for a top-notch track.

The path of karma is very intricate; therefore we should understand the distinctions between karma, akarma and vikarma. If we simply engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, everything becomes clear. Otherwise we will have to make distinctions between what we should do and what we should not do in order not to become entangled. In the ordinary course of life we unknowingly break some law and have to suffer the consequences. Similarly, the laws of nature are very strict and stringent, and they accept no excuse. It is a law of nature that fire burns, and even if a child touches it, he will be burned despite his ignorance and innocence. Thus we have to choose our course of action very carefully lest the stringent laws of nature react to bind us to suffering. It is therefore necessary to understand what work to do and what work to avoid.
I've been thinking more about my past experiences with walking at night in the mountains. When I was in my years between about 19 and 25 I did a lot of night walking, not for any bad intent, but just because it was interesting and it was something to do.
Wow, I feel like it has been raining for weeks.....oh right it has. And I gotta tell you my tune is getting very flat. The Northeast is a very wet place to be right now but we are safe thank god.
So living in Saskatchewan like we do, there isn’t really a great abundance of fresh sea creatures at the ready, thank goodness for the technology of freezing! This is where we start our adventure: our local fish and seafood vendor has a wide assortment of sea critters for us that are caught fresh and then frozen that we defrost in water! Here is our lovely assortment of marine wonders.

We were in a cafe in London’s Soho. I was a little distracted from what Mark was saying by a transvestite eating spaghetti sitting at the table next to us dressed in a white mini-skirt with long thin pale legs, a long blonde wig and a tanned, thin, very gnarled brown face. It was like sitting opposite a young nymphette with a squashed version of comedian Sid James‘ face bursting out from under the shiny long blonde wig.

Now I get to really the point of this conversation – Bioware. Will there be fair and balanced Faction handling? What I have been able to discover reading various Fan Sites, and Bioware’s own site, is that it seems that both sides are basically identical. There are four Base Classes, and each Class has a mirror Class that corresponds on the other Faction. Names are changed for the Class, and for skills available, but it looks like they are very close to the same abilities with a few cosmetic changes.

Abell et al., 2000 (Denmark): Reduced fecundity
From some of the press release:
Understanding that it’s difficult for most moms to get out to watch a movie, the film will actually host two SCREAM screenings (the first screening of the day on May 15th and 17th) at Cinema Village, where parents are encouraged to bring their babies with them to the theater.
“Do you not? You do not want to not explode orbs?”
I think it’s fair to say that every year the financial necessity to be at least moderately successful increases. It’s worth it for a club just to stay in the league now, without having any ambition to climb higher than mid-table. All of the back-room expertise and knowhow can be invested in defensive organisation and formulating strategies to get better results from technically limited footballers.
The very next day Rylee starting running a fever. When I first checked it is was 99. Her temperature usually is at 97 so I wasn't too alarmed until 20 minutes later when I checked it and it was 101. I called her nephrologist then. I explained to her what was going on with Rylee and she told me that if her temp hit 101.6 then I would need to call her back. She didn't explain what would happen then but I felt that it wouldn't be good. 10 minutes later it had hit 101.7 and it was showing no signs of going down. So I called the doc and she explained that Rylee would need to be admitted into the hospital. Since she has reflux she needs to be monitored to make sure we don't damage her kidneys.
“I got ya,” he said. “Loud and clear.”
I know it. Even though I know, deep in my heart, that everything always happens for a reason, and that it is always (at least in the long run) for my best interest, I sometimes can’t get myself to feel it.
Under the new standards, coal plants could add equipment to capture and bury underground for permanent storage their carbon emissions. The rules give utilities time to get those systems running, by requiring they average the emissions cuts over 30 years. Still, the coal-burning industry says that carbon capture and storage, known as CCS, is not yet commercially available.

Stiglitz goes on to describe IMF failures in Mexico, Indonesia and in particular in Russia. He points out that Malaysia and South Korea, which did not strictly comply with IMF prescriptions, fared much better than Thailand which did. He ends his essay by saying "if the people we entrust to manage the global economy .. don't begin a dialogue and take their (the Seattle and Washington protestors) criticism to heart, things will continue to go very, very wrong. I've seen it happen."

Then I felt a little bit brave. I moved my desk chair to the middle of the room. I spun myself around several times. After I got over the dizziness I stood up and tried to find my way in the dark. Usually I can get around my house without thinking about it, because I know what’s where. But making my way while blindfolded was not as easy as you might think. What made it hard?

I wanted to read it first, because I thought it might be a little too old for her. However, I find that I can read books aloud to her that might be just a bit above her reading level, as long as the story is appropriate. Well, I loved this book as soon as I started it! She is a strong reader for a second grader, so she's actually reading it on her own, but I think it would be appropriate to read aloud to ages six or seven and up (all the way up to young teens). My complete review of the book is here.
International Women's Day isn't widely known or celebrated here, although it's a public holiday in quite a few countries and a relatively big thing. I knew about it but I didn't know that this was its hundredth year; it was first celebrated in 1911.

Behaviorism’s more sophisticated descendent, functionalism, turned out to be no better able to handle the issue of conscious qualitative experience. Consider this problem for functional-role semantics, which holds that the “meaning” of a word is nothing more or less than what the speaker achieves by its utterance: imagine a person whose color spectrum is inverted. Where ordinary people see red, this person sees blue and vice versa. However, growing up in the same linguistic community, this person would use color words exactly like the rest of us. Ask the inverted-spectrum person to, say, go out to the car and get the blue bag and they will return with the correct bag just as reliably as anyone else. But, the defender of phenomenology argues, what everyone else means by “the blue bag” is the bag with that quale, which is the ordinary person’s experience of the color blue: and the “invert” does not have that experience.

For those wondering if this is really necessary, I will simply draw your attention to this (slightly edited) note in the original thread on the OBiTALK forum:
Cloth pull: This is an idea that's been going around the internet a few months now, but I finally did it. I had an old disposable wipes container that's been just sitting there waiting for a purpose. After picking up a clearanced fabric piece at the store, I was able to make it into a toy for Sophie. I cut the fabric up into about 15 long strands. Then, I placed them in the container, starting one coming out of the top. I worked with Sophie on opening the top part so that she could do it all by herself. She then pulls out each piece, not-so-neatly placing it aside, then pulling the next one out. She loves it! When she pulls them all out, I put them back in and she goes at it again. She even seems to like pulling them out when the entire top is opened, not just the smaller opening. Easy, yet a great distraction!

I spent my Junior year in London. My tube stop was Goodge Street, although I could get off at Tottenham Court if I didn't mind walking a little further. My classes were at Oxford Circus. Ironically, I didn't bring my London Underground apron with me. I had packed almost entirely in a backpack and the apron, well, it seemed like an extra that could be left with the rest of my college stuff, in boxes in my parents' basement. In London I was cookbook-less and made mostly veggie-filled omelettes in a dingy basement kitchen of the residence I shared with American college students also studying in London. My roommate, Suzy, and I sometimes made cakes from from- horrors- a mix. The kitchen was not sufficient for making cakes from scratch.

The theatre, like any performing art, is devoted to tradition in a way that written arts don't have to be, so in the Department of Drama at the University of Birmingham our trees were rooted in the soil of this classic Stanislavskian exercise. Mind you, quite how the experience of being a silver birch or a cork oak helped Stanislavski's actors to play Uncle Vanya I've never been sure, although perhaps it was more fruitful when it came to rehearsals for The Cherry Orchard. But the more I write, teach and blog about fiction, the more I realise just what a good grounding a Drama degree is for a historical novelist.
First off, loved her name: Hartley. So fun, loved that she wasn’t a natural Nancy Drew. And that while possessing healthy confidence in her body she was still a little aware of her bigger butt. Totally bonded with her over that. So often girls in YA are either totally comfortable with their bodies or slightly neurotic. It was great to see one that was just…normal.

As we entered the barn, a sense of awe would overwhelm me. There, against a long wall stood a treasure chest in white, Granny’s deep freeze. And it wasn’t one of those mini-freezers you can buy today, it was about a mile long, and filled to the brim. Granny would lift the lid, and the frosty air would swirl around my peering face. And there for my sensory pleasure was the sight of a little bit of heaven, frozen and sealed in ziplock bags, or wrapped in white freezer paper. I can only describe the scent as what a snowstorm in the heat of the summertime would probably smell like. It was the scent of ice and sun and fresh fruit and veggies all captured and frozen in time.

To begin with it’s good to know concerning the relationship options which are available on the net dating site. You actually have to know what type of relationship you want to have, which means, do you wish to solely deal with finding a brand new partner or only a friendship. Nevertheless, some companies are going to focus on soul mate relationships corresponding to a long term partner but when you’ll use a majority of these sites you must be conscious of this fact as a consequence of everyone shall be on the identical web page so no-one will get caught out by a nasty surprise. If you are probably not sure about your intentions then maybe avoiding the sites which are going to be the ‘soul mate’ websites and that method you can begin off slowly and perceive what you want. However, multi relationship services might not be one of the best to clearly know what a person is searching for in a relationship.

I've been having some fun on a website called Bad Translator.

I write (mostly) YA fiction. I write mature YA for high school students. I’m currently working on a novel in which my main character (MC) struggles to deal with the death of her identical twin sister. My MC is a senior in high school. It’s interesting to write about high school students. I spend whole chunks of my days thinking about high school life and characteristics that are unique to those teen years. I often find myself thinking about my high school years. So, I thought that I’d share some random tidbits about my ms/hs career.
Overall I found the film average. I will watch again, I will enjoy Depp’s performance for what it is (and enjoy Chloë Grace Moretz stealing her scenes), I will chuckle at the genuinely amusing moments and I will enjoy the obvious style but I will mourn the lack of story and absence of substance.
In three hours I had my room mostly cleaned up. I filled the damaged plastic bins with plaster chunks and swept the rest of it to the middle of the room to be dealt with by my landlord. I dusted off and swept nearly every other area of my room. The process of cleaning kept me calm but I’m not looking forward to returning to a room I wont be able to sleep in again for a while.
During my pregnancy, I shovelled down supermarket aislefuls of pizza and chocolate, and put on a whopping five stone. In just nine months, I went from a svelte 7st 7lbs to a hefty 12 stone 7lbs (that's 105lbs to 175lbs if you're American) - which, dear reader, did not fill me with joy.

The people are all agitated but Big Dog acts like he does not have a care in the world. Baseball Bat guy is throwing rocks at the dog now!! This is getting ridiculous. Dog does not seem to care and walks off down the street toward the park it seems. The guys drive off.

When he revealed his crimes in March 2009, everything changed. Especially for me. I didn’t just lose my entire world, life, marriage, family and everything as I knew it. In one moment I went from loving, trusting and respecting my husband of 20 years to looking at him through completely different eyes. I didn’t know who he was or what he was. He became a stranger in a moment. I wondered if he was sociopathic. He even looked different, physically, to me. It was as if I didn’t know him, and never had known him, at all. But ironically, at that time, possibly for the first time, I actually knew everything about him. Finally.
As I mention earlier, some of the most interesting parts of The Beautiful Cigar Girl, beyond the stories of the Rogers and Poe, are the many insights into the period. From the virtual nonexistence of an actual police force in NYC at the time, to the dozens of newspapers, each one shamelessly and blatantly editorializing the story of the murder to push its own agenda. If you think the news media is pretty bad today (and don’t get me wrong—it is), wait until you hear what it was like in 1838, when newspaper editors used the story of an innocent girl’s death not only to sell papers, but to destroy the careers of political enemies.

Since it was cloudy drizzly afternoon yesterday, I went to my Wiccan bookshelf and leafed through several books reading or re-reading Beltane passages.

every morning for a week i’d get up at least an hour before dawn, when the gate separating the campground from the desert is opened. i’d drive into the middle of somewhere, i’d park the car, and i’d go out walking in the perfect light looking for the perfect dune, tree, rock, whatever. i’d stop about two hours after sunrise, when the sun was too high and the light had become useless in bringing out the texture, as well as the colors of the sand.

All of us were looking forward to the Spring scrimmage, for two big reasons. One, to see the new 3-4 defense being installed by Todd Grantham and co. Well, the new defensive staff wasn’t about to give Georgia’s 2010 opponents get a good look at what they are planning on running this season, so we didn’t get much of a look at that… but we did get a good look at the 3 QB’s. I have some pretty strong feelings on what I saw out there today, so allow me to opine.
Our CCM woman seems to have been a student all her life. She doesn’t have the skills or the money to make it on her own. She has to agree with them in order to get tuition, student loans, etc. – in order to live away from her parents. This would be another pressure on her to turn away from her Christian faith. She is trapped by not having any marketable skills that would allow her to earn a living without having to agree with anyone’s views. Students also have the things they read handed to them – it’s much harder for her to find the time to read things that the professors don’t want her to read – and she could never bring those things up in class safely anyway. A lot of people who thrive on being told that they are good prefer to stay in school where it is easy to just do whatever the teacher says in order to get good grades – especially in non-STEM fields like English.
As I said earlier, Banal desperately attempts to install the Triangle at the All-Filipino yet he failed. With no significant line-up changes, the team then employs a run and gun approach at the middle of the season, producing better results.

When I was small all I wanted was very long blonde, silky dead straight hair... I got the blonde right but that was all that came true in my hair dreams... I had curly, slightly frizzy thick untameable hair... the kind of hair that is the perfect barometer for humidity and rain... the kind of hair that doubles in size at the mere hint of moisture...the kind of hair that won't be told what to do... the kind of hair that requires management and lots of it... So that means I know about hair... how to straighten it and torture it in many different languages... I have tried it all in the name of straight smooth 'un goldilocks' like hair ... I have bound it, ironed it, almost killed it with chemicals not to mention the millions of blow dryers, heated rollers and straighteners that have saved me from a frizzy hell... and yet my hair has survived and continued to grow... Nothing short of a miracle..

The problem sharpened here after Kano state and 11 other predominantly Muslim states adopted sharia, or Islamic law, between 1999 and 2001, allowing men to divorce unilaterally simply by thrice stating “I divorce you,” an act that cannot be undone with a simple change of mind.

If you are already a user of Google Calendar or Gmail, you can even connect them to ScheduleOnce to make sure you don’t double-book. Knowing everything is connected puts planning at ease for me. I’m finally confident in knowing that I won’t plan three things at one time.

Life in the forest has a very cinematic quality to it. Everything feels predetermined, as if at any moment someone much larger will hit an otherworldly fast-forward or rewind button. Tension is running high through the community.

To steal the words of Henry David Thoreau: “Go confidently in the direction of your dreams.” A writer’s life may be rife with rejection and disappointment, but it is also bursting with satisfaction and success.

President Barack Obama came through Johnston’s university on Wednesday, where he said there is no greater predictor of success than a good education. “This country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of everybody who’s willing to work for it,” Obama said. “That’s part of what made us special. … That’s a commitment that we need to reaffirm today.”

Leonardo’s father hated this mystery grape as it ripened much quicker than his beloved Sangiovese and as he harvested and vinified everything together – very normal practice until surprisingly recently – he felt it added a raisiny character that marred his wine. Local experts scratched their heads, but were none the wiser. It was not until 2004, when the great Professor Attillio Scienza, of Milan University, took some samples away for DNA testing that the truth became known. Astonishingly this mystery vine turned out to be Tempranillo – Spain’s most famous grape.

I will admit I am feeling pretty uninspired these days. Just feeling like everything looks the same. SO when I saw Julie's stunning creation it literally made me scrap lift it (with her permission of course!!). I just wanted to create something that looked like that and I had so much fun :) Thank you Julie for the inspiration and for letting me use your layout :)
In the 1990s I joined the Embroiderers Guild of South Australia and found a whole new world of stitching other than cross-stitch. I have tried lots of techniques; but every time I tried to create a freehand circle it turned into a square, so counted forms of stitching are my corner of the stitching world.

However, I would certainly hesitate to complain about such a problem if I lived in St. Croix Falls, Wis. A theater patron in the town wrote a humble e-mail to the theater to voice her displeasure that she could not use a credit or debit card to purchase tickets for a showing of Shutter Island. It seems to me that the majority of Americans walk around with mostly plastic and very little paper in their wallets these days. Her complaint sounds reasonable enough, doesn’t it?
But I don't think there's any turning back this time!
I am a stay at home mom and wife. I used to be a stay at home mom/fiance and a student. I've since dropped the student title from my imaginary resume. You'd be surprised, as a stay at home mom, how often I have to defend my "career" choice. Judging by some people's reactions you would think I told them I was working on a street corner or something akin to that. Here are just a few questions and comments I get and how I answer them:
This one was an ornament that we made together. It came in a kit where all you had to do was glue on the glittery ornaments. We, of course, used glitter glue. Lorelai pointed out where she wanted me to squirt the glue and then she squished in the gems. The kit came with a marker to write your name on the ornament, but we felt the glittery dots were more important.
In contrast the the control-tower design of the front of the building, the rear, incorporating the old Bentall’s furniture depository, has a more Art Deco look to it – as well it might, dating as it does from the middle 1930s – albeit with some rather strange symbolism, such a this head wearing a crown or helmet with a padlock under his chin.
This week brings a nasty bug circling our house. My husband is leveled for three days with this junk and it starts searching for its next victim.

First, however, I have hit VIB status at Sephora. Actually, I think I hit it awhile ago, just no one told me. I had 700+ points stored up too and so I took advantage of a few of those points on my recent trip to Sephora. I went in to get my Beauty Insider Birthday gift, but sadly they were out and told me I had to come back later.

In Libya, riots against those living in the Jewish quarters occurred in Tripoli in January 1945. Sixty percent of Jewish possessions were destroyed and 135 people were killed; soldiers acted as accomplices to the rioters. Jews were forced to evacuate. Jews in Hara, Tripoli, and Benghazi were put on remand. In 1948, there were more riots. An eighty-four-year-old Jewish leader, Halfalla Nahum, was murdered in Tripoli in 1963; during the summer of that year, other Jewish figures were attacked and injured. In 1967, riots broke out and ten people were killed. In 1969, an anti-Semitic campaign was initiated against the Jews, and Jewish cemeteries were razed in 1970. Sixty-four synagogues were destroyed in 1978, and seventy-eight synagogues were transformed into mosques, or, in the case of Benghazi, into Coptic churches.
Counterterrorism experts attribute the original invention of the two tactics to Asiri, and it was his brother who wore the underwear bomb and died while attempting to kill Prince Nayef.

Line Dances. 90′s folk loved line dances. We had the Cotton-Eyed Joe, the Electric Slide, and eventually The Macarena. This Spanish (I think it was Spanish) song took the world by storm in the 90s and people everywhere – no matter their age – were doing this crazy, weird dance to this crazy, weird song. Once again, it was normal.

Soros has dirtied both sides of the aisle, trust me. And if that weren’t bad enough, he has long held connections with the CIA. And I mustn’t forget to mention Soros’ involvement with the MSM (Main Stream Media), the entertainment industry (e. g. he owns 2.6 million shares of Time Warner), and the various political advertising organizations he funnels millions to. In short, George Soros controls or influences most of the MSM. Little wonder they ignore the TEA PARTY, Soro’s NEMESIS.

Potassium is part of the electrolyte family of minerals, alongside sodium and chloride. Working closely together, these electrolyte minerals actually conduct electricity when dissolved in water! Naturally, potassium plays a key role in maintaining proper heart function, transmission of nerve impulses and muscle contraction – operations that require electrical communication. The frequency and degree to which our muscles contract, and the degree to which our nerves become excitable, both depend heavily on the presence of potassium in the right amount.

Coco pops: No, I don't mean the crappy chocolate cereal that I got when I googled this, I'm talking about a multigrain puffed "cake." These snacks are in the same family as rice cakes, in that they are crunchy and can be held with your hands, but they have just a few more ingredients. And I do mean "just a few" because they contain: wheat, rice, corn and sea salt. The end. I have found these wonderful things at Wegmans and Whole Foods, both of which are now offering a "whole wheat" option in addition to the regular one. Each "pop" has a whopping 16 calories so I like to let them have as many as they want when they're looking for something to crunch on. One of their favorite ways to eat these things is with hummus. Lots and lots of hummus.

The Look: The box itself is just like any Hot Pocket box you’ve ever come a crossed with: showing the food, the laughable Nutrition Facts (but I still love you anyway) and so forth. The only difference is that this box has ‘LIMITED EDITION’ on it, so you know it’s important. As for the look of the actual hot pockets, well, they always looked like dirty pizza crust and this one’s no different. But hey, hot pockets aren’t pretty, they’re delicious! So let’s take a bite…
I also have been on a mission to find a pair of mint colored jeans. I found some online at Nordstrom and again, took a leap of faith in ordering them. They are Wit and Wisdom skinny jeans which I bought in the dark denim and really liked, so I am hoping they fit the same. They were on sale for $49.90! I also had to get a pair in a rose color since they were on sale for $59.90, but they are by Blue Essence and I'm not sure how these will fit. We shall see. I just really liked the color!

Yesterday I was feeling the urge to start getting organized. I was surprised, since usually that hits about two months out. Obviously school has been keeping me busy! I was in a parade on Thursday, as one of the Scout leaders. I got to ride in a Humvee and shamelessly promote my Walnut Park Group. Scott had all of the kids (poor guy), so he didn't even get to see me! They got cold and tired, so had to leave! I don't blame them at all! It was COLD! The good news was that we didn't have school on Thursday and the kids didn't have school on Friday either! Lucky kids. I had a big math test, that I'm pretty sure I did at least a B's amount of work on.

I started by covering a piece of card with pieces from an old french newspaper. I wanted it to be quite shabby so didn't cut the pieces, just tore them from the pages. I then used DI to age it, you can't see that much of it in the end though ! I then stamped images from different stamp sets including Oxford Impressions, Tim Holtz, Katzelkraft and Stampin' Up. I cut the images down to form a collage style background. For the pen nibs I masked them off and then stamped the text over them. The main image is an Oxford Impressions stamp and I've cut it out using an oval deckled Nestability and given it the DI treatment.

They start the season by playing their first five series on the road.
When I teach a lesson to my adult ESL students, I find that every group is different. What worked for one group might not work for another. I find this out by observation and by asking questions. Since my kids have had the opportunity to learn at home all their lives, they have had the chance to listen to who they are. They have had the chance to figure out what type of learning works best for who they are as individuals. Honestly, they have done quite well without "research" getting in the way.

Reginald gave the sign and Bertie crept off to the left in a low crouch, picking his way carefully between the sharp bits of bone sticking up from the ground.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the heat.

For one, what would happen to those statements not issued; in other words, if a political party decided not to respond to a story? Surely that too would constitute it withholding its comment from journalists? So, to be accurate, all statements, on all issues would have to be sent to all journalists. How would they know the political party in question had honestly put all its thoughts to paper? What if it was withholding something, even subconsciously?

So I am going to hope (hope really, really hard) that my computer will last through the year. I just don't know what I would do if this one stopped working. So many challenges. So many opportunities to see where I jump into purchases without ever exploring the other possibilities. It was a good experience for me to have. I take so much for granted. I really do.

Jim and I have grown up together. We have very few like interests other than our children, grandchildren and our two dogs. He is my rock and a perfect counterpoint to my fly by night ways. And I am his personal jester and the one person who never bails completely on him. We have supported each other through sickness and in health. We have held each other up through the nightmare of losing one of our precious children, our son Nicholas. We've also spent some time apart. But guess whom I called every time I had a problem, or needed to tell one of my funny stories? So I think it's fair to say that we've been married for 35 years. I still crack him up and he still shows his affection by doing things like filling our freezer with way too many bags of brussels sprouts because long ago I mentioned I like them. Geez I get sick of those damned sprouts. But I won't tell him because I know that those silly little cabbages are love letters from the Mystery Man.
There is nothing more painful in this world than facing day after endless day without your child in it. What could possibly be harder? Everything is changed- colors, textures, sounds, feelings. Us. We are changed.

I was surprisingly calm, considering this was my first major surgery. The fibroid was squashing my other organs-- organs I like-- so I knew it had to come out. I had an operation called an abdominal myomectomy, and was warned that there could be horrific pain afterwards... but there wasn't. There's been a lot of discomfort, swelling, bloating, and pathetic-looking walking, but it was not the agony I had heard it could be. Huzzah!

Secondly, was the excellent Underworld Awakening in 3D, which I have already reviewed on my blog. The third film I saw was Haywire, which has nothing to do with the undead. It tells the tale of a female black ops agent who is double crossed on a mission in Dublin. She survives the assassination attempt and goes after those who set her up. Gina Carano plays the betrayed agent and she is very good in this film. As a champion mixed martial artist, she is excellent in her fight scenes. The film drags in places but overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. There's just something about hard-ass females kicking butt that I like.
However, it may be well worth the effort.
On Jan. 4, Embrey posted the following on the Info page of the same Meetup: “how ’bout that letter to the editor in this week’s leesburg today dated 12/31. states our displays were tasteless, irreverent, irrelevant, obnoxious… goes on to state that some purposefully mocked and insulted others’ beliefs. it seriously requests that the courthouse not allow words next year but only displays (and of course gives the manger as a perfectly acceptable example). fine by me. i am picturing my son’s santa cross on that wordless lawn now! his ap is already in so bring it! lol.”

Sistermatic Response came about when two sisters, sisters who spent many hours swinging on swings and staying up into the wee hours of the morning, realized that all the things they regularly discuss--such as sexism and gender oppression; sexuality; gender identity; gender roles those all tie into each other and tie into sexism; the problematic (and positive) themes and tropes they regularly saw in their favourite (and least favourite) TV shows, novels, movies and comic books; and the dismantling of and resistance to the various and complex systems of oppression that make up this culture--could be written about, too, and shared with others.

The owner of the cottage we were staying in, and indeed the whole island also works as a creel fisherman and offers trips out on his boat. As you may know, one of the things that is a must for any holiday for Me is to get out on the water, so it will come as no surprise that beloved and I headed out one morning on a “Shellfish Safari”, as they are charmingly called. So, on a bright fresh morning we boarded our ship.
A few months after my return from the UK, my mother not only contracted the shingles (an unbearable nerve pain condition) but she also had a fall in her nursing home and fractured her hip. This was especially traumatic for my elderly mother and very upsetting for me too. Unfortunately, due to the shock to her system, complications and the medication she’d received, my mother has gradually deteriorated in health and is still unable to walk without assistance. She did, however, turn 95 just before Christmas, so despite everything she still keeps on keeping on. Life happens. Get on with it!
The characters and their personalities were a highlight for me. I found them especially entertaining. I love that the main character is so very HUMAN - flaws and all.

On the talk itself, it’s a pretty basic run-down of their work. It goes over the role of the newspaper in their organization, their opposition to the idea of the vanguard party, and their work in giving prisoners a voice. I agree with everything they stated, and I would encourage anyone who lives near one of their locations to drop in and check them out.
It's a fake holiday, but it looks like it is going to be a big party.
A consensus with the press
Like the young boy in the book of John, (John 6:1-14) , who offers up his lunch to feed the multitudes, I offered up my blog, my words, and my heart to this cause, not knowing really what God would do with it. But as God fed the multitudes with five loaves and two fish, I have seen how much God can do with just the smallest effort and a willing heart. One blog post, a few encouraging words on Facebook Week of Menus fan page, raised not $1000, but instead $2200, more than double original amount. I was humbled, astonished and oh so very blessed by the openness and willingness of strangers. It was with such humility and gratitude I took the money and then had the opportunity to give it to different projects for Haiti.

This is winter in the town that I grew up in as a tiny child till I was 13 and it was very very cold in winter. Stanthorpe is this town and it is renowned to be the only place it snows in Queensland. I rode my pushbike to school with no gloves and I can tell you it is damn cold there, although all the years I lived there myself I never actually saw snow. The year I left it snowed or the next year but I missed it and still to this day I have not seen snow. In Stanthorpe everything freezes. The taps are always frozen, it was a common occurrence!

“One, two, three…” he murmured stepping onto the ledge. The bitter breeze of the deepening night blew his short dark hair in puffs around his head. His girlfriend would have admired that. That single image of him on the ledge, with that bitterly black gun dangling from his hand. She would have liked his legs parted, standing strong, his back ramrod straight. She would have draped herself off him and dared him to drop her. And he would stare back with those iridescently cold blue eyes of his and she would pull back. She wouldn’t show it, but she would be afraid, afraid of him and those cold emotionless eyes… but she would also hunger for him; for the white shirt that billowed about him leaving his chest bare to weather the cold. For the way his dark denim sat neatly on his hips. She would hunger for him. If only it was him she hungered for.
For example all the best evidence shows that parents now devote more time to caring for their children than ever before, and in particular the current generation of fathers has massively increased the amount of time they spend with their children compared to previous generations.Demonstrably so. The experience of anyone who has kids will tell you that modern parenting is now almost a competitive sport. Mums and Dads of the late 20th and early 21st century are replaying the 'keeping up with the Joneses' battles of earlier times by trying to show how much more perfect they are than parents of their offspring's friends.

So since these pants look enough like a skirt that we at the shop at first thought they *were* a skirt, that's what they're going to be. I ripped out the seams at Starbucks and took the thread out and put it in a tree, hoping the doves will use it in their nests. I keep hoping to find an old nest woven with bits of floss--I toss it into the wind and hope it catches their eye. Better to use cotton floss than some of the crap they're forced to use--nylon string and stuff.

April came and went and I never made mention that just a couple weeks ago marked mine and Steady's two year anniversary. Two years since Steady Smiler first owned me. It is crazy to look back and see where we started and to see where we are now. I have changed in many ways. We have both changed physically. I was just ignorant enough to have taken a chance on a horse that I am fairly certain 9.9 people out of 10 would pass up with not as much as a second glance. He came straight from the track after racing for 8 years. He was not much to look at, ewe necked, dirty, the fact that he acted like a complete psycho when we went to load him on to the trailer, not to mention that with so many years on the track what did that mean for his legs and soundness? None of that was enough to deter me. Why? I really cannot tell you why, I just knew I wanted him. Little did I know where the next two years with him would take me. I will let the pictures tell the story.

I love you! Early on in life I learned to love to read. Inspired by mother, and several teachers, I developed my own interests and favorites and read voraciously up until high school. In high school and college I then fell out of love with reading. As stubborn as I am, I've never done especially well with being told what to do, and it was a new concept being told what to read and how fast to read it. I felt like the teachers had no taste in books, and none of the selections ever seemed to appeal to me. It got a little better in college, but I was so bogged down with text books and studying that if I was reading for pleasure I felt guilty because it meant that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be. Enter my savior in reading: the Kindle.

Many students expressed concern for the health of others who smoke and those who are exposed to secondhand smoke: the smoke hurts not only the smoker, but others who breathe in the smoke as well. They noted that “people wouldn’t get as sick if they stopped smoking.” Several students mentioned smoking was “bad for your lungs,” and caused illnesses such as lung cancer. One student stated “you can live a better life without a cigarette.”

Zach "graduates" from preschool next Wednesday. I watched some young kids get on the bus this morning and thought to myself, "He is not going to school in August and he is most certainly not riding the bus." But...he will be doing all those things, and without me. I'm not ready yet. I know this will come as a shock to those of you who really know him, but his new favorite topic is weather. (Maps, geography...it only makes sense that weather would be next.) Unfortunately for us, that results in some obsessions with bad weather and feeling scared. And since it does nothing but rain where we live, I had to get creative. Last week when it started to storm, I told him that every time he heard thunder or saw lightning, he should say, "God loves me." Cheesy, yes, but I had a feeling it would work. So far, so good. He still gets nervous so he says it all run together, like "Godlovesme." Melts my little heart. Also, we are re-learning first time obedience because Mom/Dad have slacked off apparently. We are discussing telling the truth and that character means that you do what's right no matter if anyone is watching you. Did I mention this is exhausting? I'm sure my mom is chuckling under her breath as she reads this...
Despite having one of the shorter careers out of their contemporaries, the El MidaZ Affair were one of the biggest groups of the early 1970s. Comprised of lead vocalist Javier El MidaZ, drummer Willie “Knuckles” Johnson, bassist Bobby “Too Tall” Willingston, guitarist K.C. Anderson, backup vocalist Rasheeda “Bird” Jackson, horn players Jake and Drake Wyman, and keyboard player Guter Jivelbergen, the group earned their reputation on the chittlin circuit as a must-see live act, playing festivals, state fairs, and jook joints across the south.

When I called just now your first hireling told me he didn’t have the authority to break everything off. I knew what that meant: he was sending for the Big Kahuna to sweet talk me into something I no longer want. Well, I’m sure you’ve heard about how that went. At some point, bringing up the years we’ve been together is the most abrasive strategy there is: it shows me how much of an idiot I’ve been for the last six years. So database that: you’ve lost your hold on me.

Roast chicken is one of those kitchen basics that I've never been able to master. Mine is usually passable, but often dry and flavorless. So Dorie's version, Roast Chicken for Les Paresseux- lazy people- was my choice this week for French Fridays with Dorie. The recipe was incredibly easy, and I'd have to say that it's as perfect for busy people as it is for lazy ones.

Then rushed home to get everything put safely away.

I am an INFJ. This means I spend a lot of time alone and all my secrets, excitements and worries go into a little diary that I carry in my purse. The best of what is written there will be posted here, hopefully for your enjoyment. It's hard for me to share what I write, even with professors and old friends, because it is so intimate. There's this lovely barrier, however, between us now that gives me what I rationally know to be very slight (as I am using my real name). It's like peeing in a cubicle; you're right next to the other lady, but the thin, four foot tall wall offers a little recluse. I'm an English major with big dreams and an ego to match. I'm minoring in philosophy and shooting for the honours program. I play guitar and sing. I get my heart broken. I write.
The EDL are wrongly painted as racists, Nazis and Muslim haters. This simply isn’t true. We do know that some groups have tried to cause trouble, and that some “agent provocateurs” have instigated trouble, groups such as Combat 18, Blood And Honour, Antifa, UAF, their Communist sympathisers and anarchists. As a movement we have been attacked by the far left and the far right, we have had to endure a state sponsored smear campaign used against us from the offset by the state controlled political elite media machine. Apparently we are Nazis because we love our country, because we have the backbone to stand firm in the face of Islamic adversity rather than ignore it, hoping it will go away.

Oskar Blues - The original OB location, the heart and soul of the company, is located in Lyons, CO and is the perfect place to grab dinner on your way back to Denver after a day spent hiking Rocky Mountain National Park. Cajun food, live blues music, an old school arcade in the basement and a small brewing system used for pilot batches and the beer sold on tap. The newer OB brewpub, Oskar Blues Homemade Liquids and Solids, is located in Longmont and features over 40 beers on tap including rotating guest selections and OB rarities. Featuring a large menu, live music, fun atmosphere and patio seating complete with boccie ball, its easy to spend all day here. Just blocks away is the OB brewery where all their beer is brewed and canned. Inside the brewery is a small bar called the Tasty Weasal. No guest taps here, but you may find rare OB batches like Stranahan's barrel aged Ten FIDY or Belgian Dale's Pale Ale. Of course, they have live music here too.

I was proud to share this home remedy with our housekeeper Auri, since normally she is the one who gives me advice on what to take. To avoid an allergic reaction if you get bitten by a tabano (a horsefly) you do the following: You kill a few tabanos in advance and put them in alcohol. Now if you get bitten, you just put some of the alcohol on the bite. You might think I am crazy, but it does seem to help. And yes, it is disgusting, too.

The pathetic quality of police services in the country has come to the fore on several occasions. It came to the fore, in September 2011, when 10 people accused of murder after a 2009 farm attack in the Free State were acquitted by the Regional Court in Ficksburg. It is again coming to the fore in the Eugène Terre'Blanche murder trial. This dilemma, which is so typical of communist-ruled countries, will probably remain a matter of grave concern until the current rulers are removed from their seats of power. And even IF that happens, it will probably take another 20-odd years to repair the damage they caused.

Pictured right is my diffuser- funny lookin thing but these are awesome for people that scrunch their hair! I seriously will not attempt to even wear it curly unless I have this on me. It hooks to the end of the blowdryer and after putting mousse in your hair & letting your hair dry a little bit you just scrunch your hair while using your blowdryer with this on the end of it. Sounds confusing for those that have never used one so maybe one day I will post a "how-to" video. That could be scary haha.

I enrolled our two-year-old at a little kids’ school this past week. It’s only twice a week. Why? She is at the age now where she wants and needs to be with other kids of her age. She’s gotten quite social in the past half year and gets very excited to play with kids.
This is one of the (many) reasons why I say that, when setting out to get published, one should prepare oneself for a marathon, not a sprint. Quite often, what makes the difference between authors who get published and those who don’t is simply the number of years they were willing to hang in there. Perseverance is everything.
Let's hope they didn't run out of Old Peculier.

Over the next few Fridays I’ll highlight one family member, starting with the youngest – our eight-year-old whose name is Zach.

When Austerlitz travels to the Czech Republic, quite literally going through the phonebook Austerlitz's, and meets Vera, a woman who had served his family, a slew of photographs, testimony and memory comes back and with the pictures in particular we get a real sense of 'the mysterious quality peculiar to such photographs when they surface from oblivion.'

Ironically, there's no similar limit on the amount of coinage. A little-known statute gives the secretary of the Treasury the authority to issue platinum coins in any denomination. So some commentators have suggested that the Treasury create two $1 trillion coins, deposit them in its account in the Federal Reserve and write checks on the proceeds...Balkin discussion:

Two days after he graduated, James moved down to Lexington, KY as a business partner for Savage Syndications. Here we are years later and James is becoming a force in the business world. He is now CFO and partner of the company. Not many can do what he can do with list building and client relations. Also James was married to college sweet heart Alyssa in August 2008. The happy couple is working hard on making the house perfect and making sure the two puppies are always happy.

Beer, once again, is being used as the scapegoat. No doubt it makes sense to some, when we see that the biggest rises are among poor people, especially men, especially in deprived parts of the north, and the media stereotype of beer drinkers remains that of the northern working class male. But this stereotype is inaccurate, as I've pointed out many times before.

I know what you are thinking, but while Santa Barbara has often been known for the rich and famous who play there, you don’t need to be either to have a fantastic time. I know this because while I am very rich and infinitely spectacular in my mind, I am merely infinitely spectacular in real life (though I’m happy to say that lottery tickets have been purchased). Despite this financial limitation, I have developed a taste for the finer things in life, and Santa Barbara is a nice way to indulge—thankfully, I’m learning how to enjoy the city even with limited means.

Due to a work gig, I got the chance to go again to Indonesia early this year. I’ve been to Indonesia about eight times already but truth is I haven’t been anywhere. I usually just get there, do work or attend meetings or training, then fly out. That is why when the schedule for our audit was finalized in January, I thought maybe it’s the right time for a solo trip. Just me and my credit card. And ATM card. Oh yeah, and clothes and stuff.

Saturday was a busy busy day. I kicked off my morning at 7am with a half marathon. No big deal. I finished in under two hours, WOOT WOOT! More on that tomorrow. After a quick shower and shipping Ryann off with the grandparents we were in the car again heading to a wedding. I jump started my recovery with some chocolate milk and compression sleeves. Today I am really wishing I would have had some compression shorts as well, my hips are hurting! That afternoon we got to watch two of our close friends, Hanna and Joey, say their vows. It was a beautiful wedding of course. And that night was pretty epic, Chris and I made it to the after party, and stayed out until 1am. For us, that is crazy talk :o).

Plasma Volume Estimates: EVANS Blue Dye test. An additional part of the research was to inject a blue dye through the saline lock catheter. Blood samples were then obtained both before and at 10 and 30 minutes following the injection of the blue dye. This test measures your plasma volume, or the volume of fluid in your vascular system. If they hadn't told me they injected a blue dye, I would have not known. This was cool to learn about.

I imagine a Tides-inspired wedding swarmed in tactile elements, with lush dupioni linens marrying back to striations of pale wood grain accents. A hint of print (perhaps in a wedding dress?) would offer a nod toward mid-century nostalgia, but glamour would ultimately reign high with big, luscious blooms and warm, inviting lighting. Certainly not for the faint of heart, this wedding would be a perfect late summer soiree for a tres-chic couple.

I'd like to say that we made Disneyland our bitch but, alas, that was not the case. As it turns out, W.B. is not at all fond of rides that feature lots of surprises and loud noises. Still, we managed to spend 10 hours in the Disneyland part and the California Adventure part (approximately half of it in lines) and I will recommend the California Adventure side because they serve alcohol there. Plus they even have a wine-tasting area. And a ginormous ferris wheel. Not bad.

I had already had my makeup applied (just some powder on my shiny forehead) and been checked by the wardrobe lady to make sure that I wasn’t wearing a tie or any clothing that would strobe on camera. I wasn’t. Some guy came over and fitted me with a microphone. He ran the wire under my shirt and hooked the microphone onto the lapel. He hooked the battery pack to the back of my pants.

First, it is given by divine revelation. In addition, the practice is followed by the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, from the earliest of times. Lutherans do not view baptism as symbolic or as a work of man but as a gift of God and His mercy. For children born in sin there is no greater gift than God's mercy and forgiveness. Also, God puts His holy Name on them and makes them His children. The water combined with God's Word brings God's Spirit to us in baptism. Being baptized means putting on Christ and being clothed with Him and His righteousness. In baptism we are buried with Christ into His death and raised with Him in His resurrection to new life. We can call it a gift of God's Spirit, a gift of His grace, a means of grace, a sacrament. Those who are connected to God in Christ are rescued from death and the devil. They are given the forgiveness of sins. Or as the Apostle writes in his letter to Titus, "He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life."

“I have never had any sympathy with the ascetic attitude. The wise man combines the pleasures of the senses and the pleasures of the spirit in such a way as to increase the satisfaction he gets from both. The most valuable thing I have learnt from life is to regret nothing. Life is short, nature is hostile, and man is ridiculous; but oddly enough most misfortunes have their compensations, and with a certain humour and a good deal of horse-sense one can make a fairly good job of what is after all a matter of very small consequence.”
I tried to spin the singles with a lot of twist, knowing that I would be plying with a lot of twist as well. In the past, while I got a pleasing single, when plied, I found them to be rather weak, and softly plied. But according to my spinning instructor, we were to aim for a "balanced yarn" which means that the twist in the single is balanced against the twist in the ply resulting in a truly relaxed stable complacent yarn. Well... okay.

It was almost 5:30PM. The vesper mass at the Church of Patrocinio de Maria in the town of Boljoon in Cebu Island was about to begin. The communion vessels had already been set on the center table. Parishioners were trickling in as the church bell pealed. Along with the human faithful, a pair of dogs was walking along the church aisle. As people settled on their pews, the dogs took their posts at the side of the nave.

As for updates – last Wednesday night was BW3. We didn’t win anything, but it was, as always, a lot of fun anyway! Thursday night the girls had Tae Kwon Do and I worked out with my Bingo Buddy GF and LooHoo. That night it started snowing and, as I had to be in Austin for client meetings, Hubby and I drove down there with the girls. It was fun having them come with me on this trip. The girls got to visit the SPAM Museum and play in the hotel pool and I made it in to work early! Late Friday afternoon, we headed back for the Cities as Jay Pea was headed home from school for the weekend and Doodle and I had a date night planned.

Also, the other part of the article, where the kids had to come home with permission slips to watch "How to Train your Dragon" but not for receiving the bible....ridiculous. There should have been permission slips sent home for the bible or any other religious materials that would be handed out. Has anyone noticed how violent the bible is? Or the things it teaches us that we are suppose to be doing...some areas in Leviticus (sheesh!)...should we not punish children then when they throw stones at each other on the playground? There is a reason children are not given grave details on the Civil War at such a young age in school....what is the difference?

Knowing that the “implications” of the findings would be different for each author, I can understand why the majority of these findings were discussed in somewhat vague, Abrahamic-faith tradition language. And, don’t get me wrong, this is not a bad thing. More conversations need to take place regarding the shared tradition and similarities between the traditions in order to promote interfaith peace and cooperation as we achieve God’s calling. But, as a Christian looking for more insight about the Lord’s Prayer and what that means for my life, I found myself not entirely motivated by the amount of time dedicated to research, discovery and shared experience and implications.

Edward Scissorhands is a flawed hero with immense gifts, destined to be destroyed, born of the mourning of a father for his dead child. He is somehow alive, equipped with a heart as large and clumsy as the large blades that hang from what presumably are the knobs of his arms. We all know the 1990 film. Edward is brought out of his seclusion by an Avon lady, he transforms and inspires the suburbs, and eventually must flee back into hiding, having had to kill as to not be killed and having been cast out by those that should of embraced and learned from him.

A factor that is never considered is the constant and consistent stirring up of race hatred against Whites in Blacks by the corrupt elites who are making ordinary people pay for their own feelings of shame at our past and our history. They do this by continually promoting a perverse interpretation of slavery and to make sure they have stirred up hatred against Whites they open up museums to further push erroneous view of our part in the slave trade and incite more hatred. This is racism pure and simple.

To bring it all together, I used a slip stitch through one of the top loops of each square then I created a border in half double crochet.

As we journey through life, we will get beaten up- we will get hurt and bruised along the way. Scarred memories mark our journey like markers on a highway.

If we put our hope in God, there will be no surprising ending in our lives.

In Reichert's novel, Calvin is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry who becomes involved in a project to use nanorobots for psychiatric diagnoses, and who also befriends Nate, an android with a positronic brain. In other words, Calvin is a psychiatrist who becomes interested in robotic psychology. Changing Calvin from an engineer to a medical doctor allows Reichert to make use of her own background as a medical doctor, giving the novel a hefty helping of verisimilitude.

Boyd posted a 78-77 record with 799 strikeouts and a 4.04 earned-run-average in 1389.2 innings in 10 years with Boston, Montreal and Texas.
Re-watch Value: (3/10) – If you liked Clash, or enjoy Greek mythology movies in general, you may want to add Wrath to your DVD collection, but beyond that, the movie is so forgettable that there’s really no reason to ever pick it up again, nor is there left any kind of promise for a would-be third Titans film that has apparently entered the writing stages.

Best overseas draught:
the enemies, when they are hiding…
This movie could easily be broken into two chapters with the first being a priest becoming a vampire and struggling between the two extremes, and in the second half struggling to let go of his faith to both embrace being a vampire and to be with the woman he loves. In the first half of the movie it shows a devout Catholic Priest named Sang-hyun (Song Kang-ho) who works at a hospital and is simply carrying out his Priestly duties with confessionals and making his rounds to all the patients. In secret Sang-hyun struggles with doubts and sadness, he is convinced that his time would be better served by going abroad to Africa to enlist in a volunteer program set up by the local medical staff to find a cure for a deadly disease by becoming infected so he can be studied. Going in he knows that his chances of survival are slim, but it is a chance he is willing to take in order to sacrifice himself for a greater cause. But then the unexpected happens when he does survive after a blood transfusion and is cured from the disease. Going back home his entire body is wrapped up in cloth bandages and so people start calling him “the bandaged saint”, and soon droves of desperate people start to believe he has the power to perform miracles and flock to him wherever he goes. But it isn’t long before he discovers some peculiarities, first being his incredibly tuned hearing when he hears everything going on in the hospital from the man slicing food in the kitchen to the sound of the microscopic bug crawling on his skin. Then he discovers his severe reaction to sunlight when he wakes up and he’s badly burned and has to hide in the closet all day, then it isn’t long after that when he finds out he has a taste for human blood. Finding out about all of this he tries to commit suicide by throwing himself off the building, but he doesn’t die despite the fact he lands hard enough on a parked car to crush the roof in entirely. And so he tries to hide it and get by the best way he knows how by sneaking into a comatose patient’s room and drinking the unconscious man’s blood through a tube. Now we have all seen plenty of vampire movies that incorporated religion into the story in some way or another, but I don’t think I have ever seen a movie where a Priest becomes a vampire (and I mean a real Priest and not some dystopian futuristic vampire slayer). And this is such a totally unique movie in that aspect because it is such a perfect story about Sang-hyun’s faith vs carnal desires. Like I wrote earlier, this film could very well be broken into two chapters, and within this first half it shows how this devout Catholic Priest unwittingly becomes a vampire and how his faith begins to crack in the face of his growing carnal desires. It is such a brilliant concept, and the way it is done works perfectly not only with the story but with the acting and some very impressive, but subtle, CG effects.

So what do you think of this show?
Julia Cameron calls them believing mirrors, these rare people placed in our lives by a greater hand to help us make sense of our unique journeys. The more I doubt myself, the more I cherish my believing mirrors. They each know just who they are, and I am grateful. They include my sister, my lifelong friend from childhood, the other 4 Chicks, and most recently, the supportive congregation of other sojourners down the path of children’s books, those bravely committed to write 12 picture book drafts in 12 months in 2012.

We’ve spent a lot of time on this blog talking about ‘the Gospel’ being all about Jesus being God’s promised King in whom redemption of Israel and the world comes. How do ‘Christology’ and ‘Gospel’ reinforce and inform each other ? In other words, how does who Jesus is relate to the good news of what God has done in Christ?

On Saturday the Rally begins at 11 a.m. for the very serious racers in the group. We will leave either just before or just after the main group. Our sail up to Banda Island will probably take four days if we have decent winds so I will be posting blogs from the ship’s radio once again. I haven’t had good internet in so long that I got carried away with the photos-- I hope you enjoy them.

Clear as mud? So does Treasury Holdings inDublinown TCT, and could the assets or activities of TCT be affected by the financial problems at Treasury Holdings? It seems the purpose of the statement is to assuage fears in TCT being dragged into Treasury Holdings’ plight, but from the statement, I cannot see a certain financial liability break between Treasury Holdings and TCT.
Issue #1: THE INTERN NEEDS A NAME.
#1- ‘American Citizen’ Kevin Scott (R)
Any precedent is written from the perspective of one party only. I was slightly surprised to see that ACID had taken the side of the employer of the freelance designer, the entity that is going to bring it to market, rather than the designer, so let's make this post a little freelance focused. Let's suppose you are doing some design work for a company that is going to sell a product. ACID is quite right that most of their members are going to need to own the intellectual property (copyright design right, the right to apply for registered designs and rights of a similar nature throughout the world- IP for short), especially if they ask you to design it. That implies that you have been paid a fair price for the job. The ACID precedent doesn't deal with that fair price and makes the assignment for a pound. On balance, I think you would be better served by dealing with the IP assignment in the document that deals with how and what you get paid. You can then make it clear that the IP rights transfer once your final bill has been settled. Note that you can assign IP in work not yet done. However, when working on such a commission, make sure that you keep all the work that client project separate and identifiable. It seems that the ACID agreement seeks to cover follow-on designs. At this point most designer’s alarm bells are going to be ringing. Most designers have a style and one piece of work relates to and is developed from and in others. Selling away your copyright makes many designers feel that they have sold their birthright and may not be able to work in future. If the work exists at the time you're entering into the agreement (which it wouldn't if it were a real commission agreement, but which ACID seem to assume it does, since it is going to be included in the schedule) then you can assign the IP in a specific work which is attached to the agreement. This is ideal, say, for a photograph and won't prevent you taking similar shots -- always assuming that you aren't taking the new shots to copy the old assigned work. IP in design work is usually pretty limited and that panic that you are selling your soul is usually unjustified. Is this the final work-- does the company have the right to develop and amend it? If so you may be asked to waive your moral right to object to such changes.

List all bookstores you can physically reach - chains and independents. Keep in mind specialty book stores as well.
It begins with a note from someone that the author says, “we’ll call Pete.” It concerned the previously mentioned book. Pete, while agreeing with much in the book, said, “I do think you are doing disservice to this argument … when you shun the ‘violence’ of God and the subsequent need for the cross’ justification, which was also quite violent.” Pete spoke of the “plethora of biblical examples (of violence)” and continued, “The fact is the Old Testament is a God-ordained bloody mess, and the cross is the ultimate expression of it.”
… if I held up a Georgia “G” helmet, how many of them do you think would be able to identify it off the top of their head? And with all due respect to Mark Richt, if we secretly inserted him into a police lineup, how many of them would actually say, “Hey, look, it’s Mark Richt!”

A full season with phenom Stephen Strasburg, plus the additions of Gio Gonzalez (acquired in a trade with the Athletics) and Edwin Jackson (signed as a free agent) will give the Nationals a solid rotation. Factor in Jordan Zimmerman (8-11, 3.14 ERA in 2011) and Washington has a strong 1-4. Washington also signed Brad Lidge to bolster their bullpen.
That got me to thinking. Mentally interesting. I really like it. Mentally Interesting. Interesting has a positive ring to it versus the ever negative “illness”. I think if we work together we can make Mentally Interesting the politically correct term used to describe people with mental illness.

I was drawn to the shapes and the bright colours - but I also wondered about the unpainted wooden square on the right. Perhaps it once held flowers or incense. It just doesn't seem to be part of the original structure. If you have any theories, do let me know.

My kids accept me. They know I can be a little air-heady and I lose my scissors ALL the time. They know when they see me standing in the middle of the room looking around that I have put something down and have no clue where it is. They just smile and ask what I lost this time. They know that most mornings I am happy and glad to be there. They know not to test me when it comes to talking during tests. They know my expectations... and I honestly believe they appreciate that they are set high.
Have you ever wondered how come the Tea Party movement, which consists mostly of lower middle class baby boomers, is so organized? It’s the internet. Check out this list of Florida-based tea party groups that are active on the web. They form communities on websites like Meetup or Ning (remember what I said about their limited grasp of technology?) and have crazy-ass discussions about taking back America and combating online infiltration groups. These are people just like your mom, who thinks that Internet Explorer is a service provider. And your dad, who thinks that his Yahoo account is stealing his identity. Thanks to computers and social networks, the aging (who have been paranoid and angry since the beginning of time) are in a position to band together and support their own unacceptable behavior.

Everything went into slow motion.
As I reached the main road and started to loop back I checked my phone for the time. Stunned. “That mile you just ran, girl, you did it in 8 minutes.” Not too shabby. The second mile wasn’t too shabby either. Then I hit the street into my ‘hood. It’s hilly, not so much so, but enough to make you feel it. I was telling myself to dig it out, that there was only a short way to go. And then I saw a little boy outside playing. He waved an exuberant hello and said “dig it out” (I guess I was talking to myself out loud). That was the surge I needed and I sprinted the last hill to a fine finish. I was fist pumping and exclaiming all the way around the loop back to my house as I cooled down. That felt AMAZING!

"Left and to the Back" will be taking a break while you lot chew on your mince pies and fiddle with the Beach Boys box sets you got as presents while the rest of your family nag you to do something else instead. It's not quite Christmas yet, I'll grant you, but nonetheless the reading figures usually start to plummet around about now, and I've got a busy festive season ahead so unfortunately won't be in a good position to keep the blog updated.

Once again, I am writing this week’s blog rather late in the day. Almost 11 p.m. to be exact. Much as I was two weeks ago, I find myself uninspired on subject matter. I was tempted to write about the results of the Alberta election earlier this week, but nearly every conceivable angle has been taken on that already, so it seems a waste of time.

I sat in those meeting smiling, wondering and looking around for someone to raise her hand and object. I didn’t find one single woman during the year I worked there who did so. I was astounded with those people whose conscious died and who justified it by saying (What can we do? We’ve got to live!)
As for the movie, and as mentioned in McDermott’s article, the camera was horrid. I never got a chance to look at the darn pin since somebody was messing around with the focus knob. Maybe the camera people were aiming for a “mockumentary” thing, but I just couldn’t focus on anything, period. I felt as though the camera people were suffering from ADHD or in a drunken earthquake or something. You can read more on that in McDermott’s article.
There is such a long distance between the kitchen and the main hot water heater that the 2.5 gallon under the sink heater actually runs out of water before the hot water gets there... So you have hot water instantly, followed by cold water a minute later, followed by hot water, a minute after that.

The day has finally came and went! It went by all so fast but so slow at the same time! The few days before, I was a bundle of nerves. Bundle of nerves is an understatement. I was a wreck. I was nervous, scared, excited, happy, etc etc.. As with anything with the Army..things ALWAYS change. As the weeks went by and the end of the deployment ended, the final date changed at least 4 times. Shoot, it even changed within the last 48 hours. He originally was supposed to be home on Sunday night around 10pm but on Saturday around noon we found out that we were not going to be seeing him until Monday morning...my heart sank...but after my initial "down" time, I came to accept that God knew what was best for our family and for all of the other soldiers. Monday morning is what it was going to be...but now I had 2 more days to wait! AHHHH!!!
A bonus to reading that will eventually come is writing well. You almost can't help learning to write well if you read great literature. At least you will be able to write well-enough! As a blogger, I might not be a world-renowned paperback writer, but I certainly enjoy practicing my 'craft'... and again, that's the goal!

The Saga of Gösta Berling is about a preacher’s fall, at least on the surface. It’s also about Greta Garbo, who appears here as Elizabeth, a role that would bring her to America’s attention soon after. But there’s so much more. Over the course of an immense, but swift-moving 184 minutes, Gösta Berling takes aim at the foundation of society itself. That is, the tension between inspiration and deviance on one hand, and convention and conformity on the other. Both are necessary; both can be abused. And it is Gösta’s suffering, far more than Elizabeth’s, which makes this point. Don’t take my word for it, though; take Mauritz Stiller’s. He directed Gösta Berling, and though a supporter and friend of Garbo’s, even he was willing to keep Elizabeth off-screen for half the film.

And yes, the two women involved in Thrall’s life to this point have been human. Taretha was a friend to him during his slavery, and ultimately affected his freedom before her tragic execution. Jaina assisted Thrall and Cairne in their campaign during the events of Warcraft III and continues to communicate with the Warchief to this day. I’ll make something clear: in neither situation did Thrall seek out a human woman for companionship, but rather they crossed paths and became fellows.

The examples i have selected here belong to an artist called Raphael Lascote these are a few of his matte paintings and something that i noticed in all three of them is the light, the lighting draws a lot of attention to where he wants you to see and overall the pieces are really vibrant and colourful in particular i like the ‘Sunset On Babylon’ piece because i feel there is a nice sense of hierarchy to it which i believe is what his intentions were.
If you’re interested to know at this point, none of the above turned out to be the case regarding my birth mother.
Soup or Bisque? Traditionally, a bisque is a soup that contains shellfish but traditions are made to be broken. According to Wikipedia, "bisque is also sometimes used to refer to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the ingredients are pureed or processed in a food processor or a food mill. Common varieties include tomato, mushroom, and squash bisque." So, yes, bisques can be compassionate!
In brief, a single photon hits a single cell, and through a series of chain reactions the cell produces an electrical impulse. This stimulus is modulated by the energy of the photon-that is, the brightness of the light. Another fascinating fact is that all of the processes described so far happen in no more than one thousandth of a second. As soon as this chain reaction is completed, other specialized proteins within the cells convert elements such as 11-cis-retinal, rhodopsin and transducin back to their original states. The eye is under a constant shower of photons, and the chain reactions within the eye’s sensitive cells enable it to perceive each one of these.

So take your 12x12 cardstock and make a pencil mark at 6” right across the paper dividing it in half. You will erase this mark later. This is the only tricky part. You are making a triangle where all the sides measure 6” out of the paper so take a ruler and start in one corner, angle the ruler against the middle line to put the 6” mark is on the line and the end of the ruler on the corner. Draw a line. Do the same thing from the opposite corner and you should have a perfect 6” sided triangle. I hope you understand how I made this, if not ask and I’ll try to make it clearer.

After the success of my lemon and lavender cupcakes, and in the interest of continuing to try new things, I thought I would have a little experiment with these coconut and ginger flapjacks. I am a huge fan flapjacks and I love pretty much anything containing ginger, but I’ve never been too nuts on coconuts. I thought the combination of moist, honey drenched oats, the warm spiciness of ginger and the earthy sweetness of coconut would take the humble flapjack into new slightly tropical territory.

So, what does this mean? Well, it could mean that the Rangers are much better at developing hitters and the Padres much better at developing pitchers. In fact, it probably does mean that.
The yeasty Blanche de Chambly ale on lees played well with the cheese. The bubbly, golden beer pops with flavors, and it is the citrus flavor in the beer that really worked well with the grassy notes of the cheese. A nice pairing to have as we head into winter, together they remind one of a bright spring day. I’ll have to remember that in February, when winter seems never ending.
I also have a habit of “coming late to the party” where some books are concerned, and this phenomenon isn’t just reserved for books. It spills over into TV shows, movies, and generally anything that can be considered pop culture. People all around me can be raving about a book or TV show and I still won’t go read it or watch it until a year later and then I realize how dumb I’ve been not to listen to them.

Despite the fact that almost nothing really happens – large vague-ish brushstrokes, rather than a firm outline, to stay with the painting imagery – it’s a tale that could work (and yes, I’m now totally overlooking the fact that besides Puck, Sean, the island and the capaill uisce none of the other characters have any sort of personality) . However, the one almost insurmountable obstacle for the cat was a linguistic thing: that damned present tense this book was written in! Unlike in Collins’ Hunger Games, the present tense here annoyed the hell out of the cat. Speaking about reading pleasure being spoiled by a linguistic device… It serves a purpose for sure (universality), but it’s also the element that made sure there was almost no distinction in characterization between Puck and Sean. Add to that that both narrations are first-person narrations and you get two voices, which are almost exactly the same (again the universality of it all, the fact they’re two sides of the same coin and all that). Their pasts and motivations are different, despite the fact that there are obvious similarities. Their voices should be complimentary rather than identical. I felt the present tense narration just stood in the way of that.

What are some of those key traits? Let's look briefly at two systems that are efficient, despite diametrically opposed approaches to universal access. The health care system of Finland (%GDP on health care of 8.5%, HCE of 7.6) is government-owned and -operated -- classic Beveridge Model socialized medicine. Singapore (%GDP on health of 3.4%, HCE of 21.5) is a public-private partnership funded by a combination of government subsidies, a limited NHI scheme, mandatory Health Savings Accounts, and out-of-pocket payments. Nonetheless, these two disparate systems have much in common:

Well I trotted my little self right on up to the customer service desk and I demanded that they de-turd the restroom for the health and safety of the other Wal*Mart patrons. Then I told them exactly what I told you. I told them there should be a sign just like the sign in the park. You know the one that shows the person picking up dog poop, only with them picking up kid poop. You know what Youlanda, the Wal*Mart customer service lady and I know that was her name and what she did because it was on her name tag, said to me? She said “WHO DOES THAT?” My thoughts exactly. Now where was I?

I noticed your work of art in the Chicago Tribune this morning. I am sure you are elated with the exposure you have received. Unfortunately, you obviously needed to accomplish this by using Sarah Palin (an easy target) as your inspiration. I hope the feminist groups in the United States take note of your efforts to humiliate a woman of intelligence, courage and leadership. The role model that these groups have promoted over the years to have the opportunity to become President or Vice President of our nation has been ridiculed by your “work of art”. I work in the art field, totally enjoy creativity, am not a feminist, and am totally not impressed by your work. I feel sorry for the people of Bridgeport and visitors that will be exposed to your art.

Mike Leigh's films have always been concerned with how ordinary people live their lives. His intense, emotionally forceful dramas deal with the everyday incidents, the struggles and minor pleasures, that constitute the lives of the kind of utterly typical working class people who don't often appear in the cinema. This focus is apparent right from his very first feature, Bleak Moments, which lives up to its title with a series of snippets cut from the life of the secretary Sylvia (Anne Raitt). Sylvia takes care of her mentally handicapped sister Hilda (Sarah Stephenson), and the two sisters live a lonely and mostly isolated existence, Sylvia sitting alone, drinking glass after glass of sherry, this uneventful life only occasionally punctuated with awkward attempts at dating and companionship. Sylvia has a boyfriend, Peter (Eric Allan), a repressed and stuffy teacher whose interactions with Sylvia are strenuously polite, marked by long awkward silences and a complete absence of physical intimacy. In many ways, she seems more taken with the equally awkward but much warmer Norman (Mike Bradwell), a young and somewhat grungy guitarist who rents Sylvia's garage to print copies of the literary magazine he works for.
Why shortchange yourself of one of the very reasons for eating, nay living?
Maybe it's because I work with a population that doesn't always have the luxury of involved parents, or maybe it's because I've had several cases lately where the kids didn't have parents at all. For whatever the reason, it's been on my mind that I should publicly acknowledge Kyle's efforts.

Sharing of information seems to be the primary drive of social media. Statuses, photos, locations and recommendations have never been easier to share than before. Facebook's frictionless sharing also have taken sharing a notch higher - which is also a bit scary if you ask me. With the growth of the cloud and mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, sharing has never been this mobile than ever before.
I decided to email Leila and ask for help. WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS?!?!?!?!?! I feel like an absolute IDIOT asking for prayers... particularly because I know just how embarrassed I'm going to feel in two weeks when I have to come on here and announce that I got my period. Again. How could I possibly, after 6 years, expect anything to be different? How could I so boldly ask all of you to pray for me, as if I'm so important, and my "getting pregnant" deserves an army of prayer warriors?!?!?! Who the heck do I think I am???

Sadly disappointment can also occur for no other reason than life is not fair and bad things happen. This means that just because we want something doesn’t mean we are going to get it. But it does mean that as soon as we realise that we will fail at things or people will let us down, we can move on and put the disappointment on a shelf along with our other life-experience memorabilia.
In 1898 George Wilson, Eugene Hubbard and George Harshman located a reservoir site for the Fruit Growers Reservoir in Hart’s Basin. They organized a company among the residents of lower Surface Creek to build a dam. Shares of stock were sold at $10 per share and by January, 1899, a 20-foot day, 450 feet long, had been completed. It is interesting to note that wages paid to the crew for the construction of this dam were $1.25 per day per man, or $2.00 per day for man with a team of horses.

I read Ann Evans' post yesterday with great interest, and - all right, I admit it, just a tiny little bit of envy. She seems to have so many ideas that she turns into stories. At the end, she asked what was the oddest object/place/thing to have inspired her readers so far. Hm, I thought, trying to remember even one. Could be struggling here.
Of course the big news is this money/ investment loss that JP Morgan took, and of course Ina Drew retiring (which is just the formal polite way for these type's to say she got her ass fired basically), you have Jamie Dimon of JPM saying on camera that they "know" their sloppy, stupid, and have bad judgement ... but believe me Mr. Dimon ... the people are moreso for letting you continue this rubbish. The market's took a hit yesterday of nearly down by 13, but dont worry, JPM is still making alot more than they lose, and the smallest investment's will only lose in the longrun along with a schlew of 401K's ... the market's will of course go like a rollercoaster ride, but like never in market history, simply because of what the market's have become and thing's like corporate computerized speed trading, etc ... if ya'll think that shit was wild back during the pre- Great Depression .... that wasnt shit compared to how this one can and will move of today. All you have is a bunch of speed trader's today, that are moving so quick they dont even have time to analyze what their doing, and acting more like their intoxicated while driving this engine, pumped up on Adderall : ) , the giant computer's do the placement's in mass, and much quicker than any investor can, in large amount's and various avenue's, they dont understand loss and gain's, their programme is to weigh and place, not to analyze gain's and losses, risk vs. reward, etc, and that's what their missing. Who got so loose that they wouldnt feel a 12" inch dildo up their ass if they sat on it ... meaning, they too will need a jackhammering of their asshole's to see where they are fucking up ... and believe me ... as I have said time and again ... if we dont break them up or do something ... they will destroy themselves anywayz ... in time. As far as these so called "reform's or regulation's" ... heh, heh, heh, heh, heh : ) ... please ... again ... do you reform or rehabilitate a crack addict or junkie/ dopefiend by leaving them in a room with a couple key's (kilo's) of dope, leaving the room yourself later and telling them to limit themselves? ... they will die from an overdose, same as these will eventually destroy themselves, sadly they will drag down many other's with them though, the point being, they are "addict's/ junkies".
Recall that back in 2009, White House economists Jared Bernstein and Christina Romer used their old-fashioned Keynesian model to predict how the $800 billion stimulus would affect employment.

This pure Shiraz is labelled as Barossa Valley, but actually comes from a vineyard in the cooler Eden Valley which gives just half a ton to the acre – they normally expect one and a half to two and a half – the vines are dry farmed and are 70 years old.

Appalled at the UK government’s plans to monitor our every text, phone call and email, Eric Finch decided to act by launching “National ‘cc all your e-mails to Theresa May Day” due to take place on Tuesday, May 1st. He explains why he did it, and why we should all join him.
Oh there are so many lovely creative spaces around blogland, sheds and craft rooms and attics and all sorts of hidden little nooks where all kinds of creativity whirrs on. So today, in complete contrast to all those wonderful spaces, I thought I would show you one of my creative spaces.
And lastly, my little one (age 7) is very into poetry at the moment. Specifically, she is reading several Shel Silverstein books - for what seems like the hundredth time. :) Runny Babbit is on one of her all-time favorites, and as such we're using it as inspiration for several language arts projects. Runny Babbit, for anyone who doesn't know, involves poems in which the first two letters of words are switched. This creates funny creatures, like a Pinky Stig. This book would make a great gift or a good addition to the family library. We keep borrowing it from our public library, but I think I may put this on my birthday shopping list...
Bernadette's withering look, mid-speech, appears to stun the former Prez back into line, giving perhaps a moment's insight into exactly who wears the pantalons in the Chirac household.
no not a bit of it, despite the fact that I shouldn't still be here, not only am I here, but I think getting better. My doctors are kean to point out ad nusaeum that there is no cure but I'm off to be debulked shortly. This means that Mr M my surgeon is popping inside and leaving with everything he can take that I don't need anymore. After that I have a bit more chemo to suffer through and then with luck and a fair wind I should be cancer free, at least for a while, and a long while with more luck.
The Tylers have a perfect life—beautiful home, established careers, two sweet and talented daughters. Their eldest daughter, Leah, an exceptional soccer player, is on track for a prestigious scholarship. Their youngest, Justine, more responsible than seems possible for her 12 years, just wants her sister's approval. With Leah nearing the end of high school and Justine a seemingly together kid, the parents are set to enjoy a peaceful life...until everything goes wrong.
Shannon started singing, “Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’,” and she wagged her finger. Of course, Krystal giggled and joined in. They almost shouted the lines of chorus they loved so much. “And I was like baby, baby, baby, oh … Like baby, baby, baby, no … Like baby, baby, baby, oh … I thought you’d always be mine, mine.”

Take a look at the combat system. Excluding Chainmail and WotC D&D, the D&D combat system is enemic compared to wargames of the era. (Oh, let’s exclude AD&D too just to keep it simple.) And D&D was created by wargamers. That says to me that D&D wasn’t primarily about combat.
I wasn't really wanting to drool over a picture of Steven Gerrard's wife, of course not, but I was on a train last Saturday, and another man had been engrossed in it for 10 minutes or so, and when he reached his destination and left the paper behind it seemed a pity not to pick it up and see what he found so interesting. Hmmm!
That’s grace.

Here's a good one - last night I was typing in the password for the "parental controls" on the kid's internet access, and I didn't have enough light so I flubbed it. Over my shoulder I hear Tio's voice telling me what the password is! The very audience I was 'parentally controlling’ has my password. This wasn't some 2 letter or birthday password, either. No sir. I had a long phrase like "freezerburnssuck2012". And Tio had it down verbatem.
Promptly at 8 or so, I got to the airport. (There was surprisingly little traffic on the 405 – the only good karma of my travels), only to get to the USAirways desk and find out I didn’t have a seat. So, my seat was reconfirmed, again (redundant, but what happened) and I amused myself in the airport lounge for two hours while I waited for the Lufthansa gate to open. (That’s a really funny story, but not for this bitch session).
Delightful because the stories are fresh, unexpected and the characters are hilarious. Astonishing because these little 150-page books for middle graders are not completely happy or lighthearted. EVERYTHING starts with the disappearance of the girl's parents and continues with dark disasters to herself and her carekeepers. TROLLS is full of Aunt Sally's creepy stories and her charming antics.

* Horseshoe crabs "are survivors of a species that became extinct 175 million years ago." Leaving aside the question of how this is "history," how exactly can an extinct species have survivors? Maybe he means that they're descended from a species that is now extinct, but then so are humans.

Imagine Greenpeace producing a PSA showing a group of hardened whalers silently sobbing over the slaughter they hath wrought, laying down their harpoons, and hugging dolphins ending with the line "What if everyone acted like whalers?" That's the kind of confusion I'm grappling with here.
I used my favorite Barefoot Contessa recipe, except I used Kahlua instead of Grand Marnier. I poured the custard into different sized ramekins, and baked them in a water bath for 35 minutes.

A lot of the blog might be about Hermès and everyday style, but a lot of my life is about living in what I hope is a harmonious relationship with the world around me. We started caring more for the animals lately, including all the feedings--and wouldn't ya know it. A week into the experiment, and ALL the animals come loping up to me like I'm an old friend. Seriously--ever seen a llahma run across a field? I have. Every day. And that cute, cute pig? It takes her a moment to pull herself up (she's a porker!), but then she comes happily forward on four little fast feet and looks up at me with this utterly trusting eyes.
Postpartum is the period following the birth of the new born. This period is as crucial as the pregnancy itself. This period starts when the baby is born and continues till the mother has almost reached the pre-pregnancy weight. During this period the mother undergoes various changes - mentally-emotionally and physically.She is also trying to cope up with the new needs and demands of the new role of being a mother and trying to accustom herself to changes taking place within her body. This can cause an immense stress on her body and her mental status. Thus a good nutrition and ample rest is a must for the mother during the postpartum period.

Nick could have tried to teach me something by letting each wild shot go past him and making me run after the ball to pick it up, but the lesson I would have learned may not have been about tennis. It may have been about him. What I might have learned was that he wasn't fun to play with. That he had the ability to keep the ball in play, but was unwilling to put forth the effort.
The bill also contained an amendment which enacts strict new sanctions on Iran’s Central Bank and any entities that do business with it, a move which will likely have brutal repercussions for the Iranian people – just like the sanctions on Iraq did.

Mr. Edwards survived the changes that occurred in the last ninety-four years of our history, from The Great Depression and WW II onward to the present day. He also survived as a blues musician, an extremely endangered species these days. In the 1930s Honeyboy played for people trying to break free of the drudgery of everyday life. These were folks who worked too hard for not enough pay, just trying to escape their problems for a while. In 2009, those in attendance at The Kachina Lodge are also worried about jobs and money, and they, too, want to leave their everyday world behind for an hour or two. If you look deeply at David Honeyboy Edwards you will see that he continues to show us through his Blues that whatever happens, we will deal with it and roll on. Some things really don’t change.

I seen the area within the magnetosphere on earth radiate with a magnetic flow. I could see and feel it circulating clockwise just under the area of earth where the magnetosphere exists. Then, once again I started to see some familiar events on earth happening due to this magnetic intensity. I saw the Hawaiian Islands as if they were in the choppiest wave pool ever! I saw the tip of Florida with water all on it, I saw the earth cracking in various places that I did not recognize the geography of. And what seemed like it was so out-of-place, yet reminiscent of the meditation I had on the 11/11/11…. I saw a massive Light pole go straight down into the White House! It created such a massive Light explosion thru out the entire white house.

The book is too old for my son (3 1/2), who doesn't have the relative grasp of the large numbers yet for most of the facts to mean much. (That didn't damper his excitement when it arrived, however). I enjoyed it, though, and it is definitely a book that I would have loved when I was at the appropriate age for it (the reading level is age 9-12), so I look forward to him growing into it.

Karachi’s turf wars and ‘day of mourning’ turned into days of mourning for many families torn asunder in the ANP- MQM crossfire. Grievances festered to the point that henchmen came out to burn effigies of their bosses/representatives and demanded a ‘Swat like’ military operation in the pestilent localities of Lyari,Katti Pahari,North Nazimabad,Benaras,Shah Faisal,Korangi,Malir and Kasba which is in flames today. Rehman Malik splutters out condemnation and vows vengeance every time this happens,yet his faux crackdown did little than tweak whiskers the last time. They’re back,bigger,stronger and armed to their teeth,playing out the aftermath of post Soviet-Afghan war like it happened yesterday. The complicated politics of Karachi will not disentangle on its own like our government hopes it will. Even the top echelons are playing favorites in this cat eat mouse game. Maybe a stringent de-weaponisation crack down is what Karachi needs. Take the lion’s teeth away and it can only meow.

Earth-based observations have long been problematic, as looking at the sun with the naked eye for even brief periods can be painful. The refinement of light-concentrating optics like binoculars and telescopes seemed promising at first, though these came with the unfortunate side effect of making you blind. Kids still enjoy makeshift experiments out in the yard, proudly giving ants and other insects a close-up view of earth’s nearest star with a magnifying glass. This attempt to educate rarely turns out well for the bugs.
Pioneer Beach Resort is almost 5 miles from the "downtown" area of Port Aransas and this is why I chose this park. It's on the quieter side of the island, closer to the state parks, and is the end of the line for the bus. The bus comes to the park once an hour from 10am to 5pm, 7 days a week. I used this bus to go to the grocery, post office, or to get to other areas of town to walk around and check out different areas.

And so there’s the lineup for Kiyosumi. Overall Hisa did a really good job matching the strengths of her team and placing them where they best fit for a victory. Of course, any weakness in Hisa or Saki dooms the team tremendously. Hisa has to perform well in the middle round in order for Kiyosumi to stay competative after any points lost by Yuuki or Mako. Of course Saki has to finish well or else the team will instantly lose. After seeing how well this unit performed in the Nagano prefecture tournament, it’ll certainly be interesting to see how they finish in Nationals. The other teams in the Nagano prefecture didn’t give enough information for all 5 to give an opinion on their placements, so I can only comment on Achiga when they reveal their lineup. I’m looking forward to that analysis as well.

I want to wear my vibrant summer clothes- long swirling skirts in rainbow shades, happy sunny clothing, we've all been bundled up in warm winter clothing for too long. Winter clothing tends to be such sombre colours. I want the sunshine to pour through the windows, even though bright light hurts my so sensitive eyes!
When OWS needs leadership, it will emerge from the movement. Agendas are already there, if invisible to the un-punk eye. And jobs? Really, Occupy has to say "We need jobs"? We ALL need jobs. It's practically a moot point.

Fulfilled releases his soul’s tao
A little scary, interesting, exhilarating, and possibly a dim bulb idea
Kṛṣṇa did not need any friends to play with Him, nor did He desire a single wife. We take on a wife because we have some desire to fulfill, but Kṛṣṇa is complete in Himself (pūrṇam). A poor man may desire to have a thousand dollars in the bank, but a rich man who has millions has no such desire. If Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, why should He have desires? Rather, He fulfills the desires of others. Man proposes and God disposes. If Kṛṣṇa had any desire, He would be imperfect, for He would be lacking something. Therefore He says that He has no desire to fulfill. As Yogeśvara, or as master of all yogīs, whatever He wills is immediately realized. There is no question of desire. He becomes a husband or lover or friend just to fulfill the desires of His devotees. If we accept Kṛṣṇa as friend, master, son or lover, we will never be frustrated. Every living entity has a specific relationship with Kṛṣṇa, but at present this relationship is covered. As we advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it will be revealed.

The vast majority of people who are complaining against the burka are those who haven’t even come across it in real life, have never had to deal with a Muslim woman who wears the burka – so why are they talking about something they have no experience of, no dealings of and where the burka doesn’t even affect their lives?

It’s important to put things in perspective. In a world plagued by political atrocities, environmental disasters and fatal incurable diseases, bedbugs aren’t really that big a deal. But they are, I maintain, one of the lonelier afflictions out there.
The Law in this country frustrates a lot of people, doesn’t it? Corruption has becomes so common that people make it into a joke just to make it less serious. In fact, meeting a man with conscience and integrity in this system strikes me speechless, mouth open and tongue-tied. If I had pursued law, I bet I would’ve been one very angry beaver, the kind who violently slaps everyone in the face with her freaking tail all day, every day. Medicine can be the same way too, having personally lived with and seen government doctors live in eternal frustration over this country’s health system. However, medicine allows things to be done right now, the results of which cannot only be seen acutely but also in the long-term. The most important part is to see that there has been a change that has occurred, no matter how minimal, as a result of an action. As opposed to law, where the result of your blood, sweat, tears, and sleepless nights is usually the inevitable freedom of a criminal because of the patronage of a powerful politician, which sounds so corny but which I also know for a fact is a reality.
In the late 1920s, Henry Ford set up an American-style town called Fordlandia eighty miles south of the Brazilian city of Santarem. Fordlandia was the centerpiece a two million acre land concession the size of Connecticut. It was here that Ford planned to by-pass the English rubber growers of Malaya and to operate his own rubber plantations. The rubber from Brazil would be used for the tires of the automobiles pouring out of Ford’s factories.

Mr Henderson actually said in the interview: “I take the Matthew Paris line on this. Matthew, says “that part of being an Englishman is being white. Now I think that's reasonable, not just from my own experience, but it seems to me that you don't get someone taking on the whole of a new culture when they come to a country. That doesn't of course mean that they cannot be British and of course if they are representing Britain there may not be the same problem that you've got if they are representing England, but if they are representing England they've got to feel that there isn't anything which spurns them, which thrusts them out from society, which I am absolutely certain that the majority of blacks and Asians do feel. I can sympathise with them because any minority anywhere is going to feel under stress.”

Most men have been on the other side of this at times. I know I have and it's not fun. I did my undergrad at the University of Florida and our ratio was 52% men/48% women. As a result, it was tough at times getting dates (sure, some said it had to do with trivial factors like personality, but I found it so much easier to just blame it all on the bad ratio). And proof of that came for me the first time I spent the weekend at FSU for a football game. The ratio at FSU was the reverse--so there were 52% women. I still remember my shock when a woman come up to me at a bar and asked if she could buy me a drink. In all my years at UF that had never happened to me. I was so certain one of my friends put her up to it that I kept looking around the bar for one of my laughing friends.

In terms of the UK copyright position (which almost certainly doesn’t apply but let’s ignore the rules on jurisdiction for the purpose of this blog), Vogue Spain has clearly copied the whole/a substantial part of the works and communicated them to the public.

Somewhat ironically, the damage has really been more on Vogue Spain’s side thanks to a public backlash but that doesn’t prevent a cause of action from arising.
