Last semester’s Exam Cram was such a success that we’re offering it again – and changing dates and times to reflect student suggestions. What is Exam Cram? Think extended quiet study hours in the library, smiling tutors and librarians, along with beverages and snacks to keep study strength up!
Likewise, there are times in our lives today wherein we seek direction from the Lord, and He only seems to reveal one step at a time. It is natural to ask, "Where are we going?" In His infinite wisdom, plan, and timing, Jesus at times chooses to keep the destination concealed. Perhaps He is protecting us from some danger. Perhaps He is removing from us the temptation to rush ahead of God's timing. Perhaps in the unfolding of these events He is revealing some aspect of His character to us that we would have missed had we skipped over this process of seeking, listening, trusting and obeying.
It is true that domestic violence effects all sections of society to one degree or another, although for various reasons, including cultural ones it is more common in non-European communities, in America for instance, murder by a domestic partner is the main cause of premature death amongst black women. However, honour killing, like muti killings, gang rape and female circumcision is a problem which exists almost exclusively amongst the new immigrant community which we have imported into our country.
On the contrary, the evidence is that there is immense pressure on the MDC from below, from the millions of ordinary Zimbabweans who have risked much and endured more.

* If you're not near an Asda, the dreaded Bargain Booze (surely the government wants to do something about store names like that?) seems to be selling it for £5.99. And it's £7.49 from Wine Rack which suggests that Asda's original selling price is higher than it need be.

To create my card, I used the same die and some decorative paper. After embossing, I used the embossed line as my "guide" to cut off the extra 1/8". I used this as my mat to reveal some of the white on my shapely card. And, here's a peek at my finished creation!

“I, admittedly, enjoy reading up about consumables but food culture sort of misses me. I think a part of me wants to understand because I really do love a variety of foods but I always seem to fall short once it starts to sound like an erotic novel about rare ingredients. Then again, I suppose the alternative isn’t much better:
After the Hancock tower we started walking towards Navy Pier. We went and explored the neat little marketplace that was down there that is indoors in the winter and during the summer they raise the garage door walls and it becomes an outside marketplace along the water.
Then there is the issue of our shower insurance.We had two identical showers fitted at around the same time. One in the bathroom and another in the shower room. When the guarantees expired our details were passed to the insurance company HomeServe. According to their records we have two different showers and because their letters were so vague, non specific and generally badly written we did not realise that the information that they held was incorrect. As a result we have paid too much for the insurance of one of the showers. Since we realised the mistake, about November of last year, we have been trying to get back the over payment and they have refused to refund the money to us. Last month we received a letter from HomeServe, dated 11 February 2011, informing us that our policy was due for renewal on 3 December 2010 with a quoted premium that is different to the two that we have previously paid. I think that we have given up on this one. It has just become too complicated to explain.
In a world increasingly dominated by the homogeneity and questionable ethics of Whole Foods, nothing warms my heart more than returning to one of the original co-operative markets that set the standard for authentic excellence. I’m talking about the kind of small, community market with hardwood floors, earthy smells and crowded aisles where you know and trust that you will never find an item for sale with a single questionable ingredient. The co-op board has dedicated itself to making informed, intelligent decisions about which products to offer and which products to avoid, for the highest goal of safely feeding its patrons.
The streets of London, and other areas of the country, have seen the most appalling violence, thuggery and downright criminality in a way that I have never experienced in my lifetime.
… but I digress. The point is that a rich life is possible for us in this world. Paul’s language gets pretty strong when he says a little later,
Some people prefer to call these unfortunate folk, “shack dwellers,” and the places where they have in desperation, set up home with any materials they can lay their hands on, are named by the government, “Informal settlements.” I suppose this sounds a little less shocking, but whatever you may name it, doesn’t change the fact that these families, through poverty, are living in the most appalling conditions.

Beeld did however record the attack, left, on Afrikaner smallholder Mrs Ada Viljoen, 78, who was beaten unconscious in a motiveless attack at her Potchefstroom smallholding on March 12 2012. They emphasized the fact that her black housekeeper Mrs LIesbet Pilane was stabbed in the hand and neck. Both women reportedly are in hospital: The elderly Mrs Viljoen with ‘unconfirmed head-injuries’, the housekeeper ready to be discharged after she fled while her employer was being beaten into unconsciousness. This WAS recorded by Naspers. However -- over the past week, at least ten other hatecrimes were carried out against Afrikaners including the attacks listed below, all on one day, which targetted smallholders and farmers in motiveless crimes. During at least three of those crimes, vile abusive cursing was used against the Afrikaner victims by their black attackers. None of these incidents were reported. Killed last weekend during this attack-wave were retired Brits farmer Okkie Els and his wife -- who died from their ordeal on their farm De Kroon in Brits on March 10 2012. Mrs Els also reportedly was gangraped before she was killed. None of these latter attacks (some also listed below) were even noted for the record by any of the sonamed ‘mainstream’ Afrikaans or English-language media in SA. Brits used to have a snappy, independent local newspaper, the Madibeng Pulse, which was run by the fearless, excellent Dreyer couple. Since their paper closed down however, the attacks against Afrikaner residents in Brits and surroundings have become badly underreported.

I had to skip last year's event because I had my little Sloaney Bear in my belly. This year will make 4 years that I started running as a way to burn fat and get my booty in shape. Prior to my first half I was never a runner, but I found myself at an interesting point in my life with time and a body that wasn't the same after baby. So I decided to give running a try and I am addicted.

This novel is by no means perfect but its failings come from ambition rather than lack of talent which Krauss seems to have in spades. There is a feeling that comes from reading the work of a mature writer, an ease that you are in the hands of someone who has something to say. This usually comes from writers far more experienced than Krauss but her maturity is just one of the attractive features in this novel about a desk and the various hands it passes through, characters created with such detail that they cease to feel like characters at all, and the novel as a whole written with a complexity that forces the reader to slow down and appreciate the thought, intelligence and humanity that has gone into creating it.

So the things that Jesus couldn’t say the Holy Spirit reveals to us and allows us to continue in the song that He started regardless of His worldly absence. He has made us all differently and uniquely so we all make different sounds when God works through us, He has made us in a way that can replicate his sound (2 Corinthians 1:22) we are not trying to replicate anyone else’s song but Gods.

The movement starts in the initial position with the body completely straight, body movement is coordinated such that the legs are ready for the thrust phase while the arms are halfway through the insweep, and the head is out of the water for breathing. In this position the body has also the largest angle to the horizontal. The arms are recovered during the thrust phase of the legs. After the stroke the body is kept in the initial position for some time to utilize the gliding phase. Depending on the distance and fitness the duration of this gliding phase varies. Usually the gliding phase is shorter during sprints than during long distance swimming. The gliding phase is also longer during the underwater stroke after the start and each turn. However, the gliding phase is usually the longest phase in one entire cycle of breaststroke.

Between the two above inspirations I was able to come up with a new system to try for my crew. We're calling it High Fives. I traced 10 hands on poster board and cut them out. I have one hanging on the fridge. When I "catch" either child following our four "big" rules (to be mentioned later in post) I put a star on one of the fingers. When all five fingers are starred, it's a high five! They can trade that high five in for various prizes, if they hold on to the high fives they can redeem them for bigger prizes! Miss M is very excited, JB has no clue...guess which one it's really for???

I am aware that not all warming effects are man made. I am aware that the planet is naturally cyclic and has patterns of warming/cooling that take eons to complete. I am aware that some folks don't think global warming is a matter for humor and won't appreciate my idea. Oh, well. The thing is, my idea is simple, safe, and based on sound scientific principle. There is no reason it could not work...and probably make a lot fewer people unhappy than if we banned beef or automobiles or industry or electricity...but I bet any one of those latter things will happen before anyone ever thinks to simply, literally, lighten up.

4. Paint on the background color. This is where you’ll use your rollers. This is also a great place to have small helpers assist with the painting. Since it’s all the same color, it’s harder to go wrong, and everyone is happy. When you paint, be sure that your drop cloth is under the space you’re painting (obvious, but you’d be surprised how often you and/or helpers wander off the tarp, and then proceed to drip all over the floor, step in the paint and walk on the carpet…). I would even recommend taping the tarp up to the wall, right up to the border of the mural, so that paint does not inadvertedly drip on the wall.

The big black guy swung out of his seat so fast he was past me and landed next to the Glaswegian: Love your ring-tone man, can you send it to me? The old Glaswegian, who had just started a conversation about his visit to the doctor after some industrial mishap, managed to convey the fact that the didn't know how to send ringtones. So the big man swung back. It was the sheer size of him: tall as a basketball player and somewhat wider.
I can close my eyes, even now, and remember walking into our house on a hot summer day in the south. The turn of the key in the lock and stepping over the thresh hold. The air had been off for days, making it just bearable to be inside while waiting for dad to turn on the AC.

If Scripture allows for the abandoned party to be free (not under bondage) from the marriage covenant when the guilty party deserts them (1 Cor 7), then because this “lesser” evil is grounds for divorce, the greater evil must also be grounds for divorce. And what is the greater evil? It is the abuser continuing in the “marriage” and persisting in abusing his victim. This greater evil surely gives the victim biblical grounds for divorce, because the lesser evil (literal abandonment) is biblical grounds for divorce.

This season has been one where Sir Alex has had to rely on a few of his younger or should I say fringe players, and at certain points you’d be forgiven for thinking that they were not capable of keeping touch on Manchester City, but whether it was City giving it away, or United grinding out results, they kept in touch, caught them, and are now at the sharp end of the table.
That Lana Del Rey songs are quite tricky to remix doesn’t stop everyone from trying. A slew of mixes for her new single “Born To Die” came gatecrashing at once the other day, and I waded through the good and not-so-good to cherry pick a select few. What I like is that every remix from this package tries a different style. DJ Kris De Angelis‘ hard-edged club take is probably the most straightforward of the bunch. Gucci Vump‘s version utilizes the strings and vocal loops with some nice drumwork – it’s all about the 1:06 moment for me. Leo Zero went for an excessive balearic vibe, while Hackman (aka Jack Steadman of Bombay Bicycle Club) opted for a blog-baiting treatment with pitch shifts and those chunky house piano chords that are so in right now.
So, I did what any unhealed person who thinks they are healed does – I went on his Facebook page to see if I could tell who he was dating. I know, mature. I’ve never claimed to be perfectly balanced.

By the way, Vicks' humidifier lineup is amazing! All the humidifiers in our home are Vicks Cool Mist Germfree Humidifiers, and we couldn't be happier with them. When Vicks heard that we use their humidifiers, they offered to send us another model to try out, so I chose their Starry Night Humidifier. You can tell that a mom designed this product, because not only is it a great humidifier, it's also a nightlight for your kids' room! It has a built-in projector that transforms your ceiling into a starry night that changes colors every few seconds. The kids LOVE the star show, although I do wish it had a dimmer, because it is kind of bright, especially in smaller rooms. I also wish there were a timer function so it could turn itself off after a set number of minutes -- but despite those shortcomings, I would highly recommend it for a young child's room, particularly a child who is just learning to sleep on his own, or moving from a crib to a toddler bed. The lights are soothing and comforting, and since mom and dad are probably in and out of his room, it's not a big deal for them to turn the projector off.

That’s not deny that young adults don’t go through a lot of stuff, it’s not to deny that the world is not, on far too many occasions, a desperate place. But where does it leave us, I wonder, if we only focus on the trauma, the angst, the trouble, the deeply complex and often destructive emotions and all the things that can go so badly wrong. As much as we need to reflect the darker side of life, it is equally, if not more imperative to focus on the happy things, the fun things, all the exhiliarating, wonderful things that being a young adult is also about. We need to find a balance. We need to find the balance in how individual books are written (grit needs to be balanced with lighter moments), and we need to find balance in what is published.

Well...on another planet in that other lifetime the one where my mother is still with me and I am a Pulitzer prize winning author and playwright I would love you and by now have given you at most 3 babies no less than 2 and I would gladly and proudly rush home to you everyday and cook your food and make the bed we slept on the night before and step out to the world everyday believing I did something special when I married you and that I could change the world and transform lives through my writing not just because GOD told me so but because you were present to look in my eyes and tell me you loved me everyday...

The smell of the hope chest never changed when the young girl would open it to place moments of her hopeful tomorrows in the chest. The size and type of wood never changed--it was always the same-a place for her to store her "moments." My brother's past will never change, and his present situation, the scars that are part of his life and the isolating life he lives due to the accident is something I cannot change or even try to reason with him on ways to change. I have spent so much time trying to repair the chest, instead of gifting it with reasons to feel useful.
So I was in seminary, hovering between the security of my pot and the great unknown of the garden. My roots were dangling in the air, exposed for all to see and desperate for water. It was in that space, the space between the pot and the garden, that I was invited back into the conversation.

Another method sometimes used is to convert a part of the overall compensation package from the previous year into a fixed base salary for the current year. This has the advantage of preserving the existing differentials between partners and also forms a small and therefore uncontroversial change.

so they’re only ever around other leftists who reaffirm their views. That’s why they seem so surprised and upset when they encounter opinions held by the majority of Americans and why they were taken so off guard by how hugely unpopular things like Obamacare are. And it’s how they keep convincing themselves they’re hilarious — by only hanging around the few remaining people who think a “Sarah Palin is dumb” joke is edgy.
If we would notice through the cycle, it implies that even experts admit that economic downturns are inevitable although the degree varies depending on the immediate course of action implemented by the government to augment the deficits, fill the gap, and minimize the damage that slow economic pace can possibly cause to a majority in the society. Many are saying that the recession may take a while nevertheless; recovery can possibly be attained sooner if economic recovery plans are formulated immediately. However, it takes a while because recovery plans are usually formulated during the midst of an economic turmoil despite prior anticipations. Reasons for this could be that experts are trying to lessen the degree of recession before taking the steps towards recovery because a lesser degree of recession gives the greater chance of a fast recovery.

If we are not careful it is times like this that our children’s children and theirs will not enjoy. At the rate of animal habitat being lost to man’s needs, pollution, climate change and acid rain the things that we are enjoying now will not be there for them and to me this does not make a rich, vibrant world, but does make for a poor, dull world. The time to get involved in saving the planet for our children and theirs, is now!

I’ve been trying to think of beautiful ecological ideas that turned out to be totally false, but I’ve been drawing a blank. Every candidate I came up with has at least a grain of truth to it. Assuming I’m not just forgetting obvious examples (am I?), I’m not sure if this is to ecologists’ credit or not. Perhaps we’re good at ‘keeping our eyes on the prize’ (the truth), and so aren’t attracted to beautiful ideas unless they clearly have at least of grain of truth to them. This would be very much to our credit. Or perhaps we actually see beauty and elegance as a mark of falsehood rather than truth, because we’re afraid of oversimplifying the polyglot complexity of living nature (see here and here for more on this). And so in the name of avoiding beautiful false ideas, we avoid beautiful truths too. This would be rather less to our credit.
I'm not sure how clear you can see it but I did paint the edges with white and then added some glitter and propped up Tilda into this cute frame.

So we set off for a Dutch owned bar, decked out in orange, the national color. We took a bus tobthe bar and got alot of crazy looks since Jessi and I ere wearing orange plastic wrap draped over our shoulders since we didn’t have any orange clothes. At the bar there were a ton of Dutch folks dancing, singing, and starting dancing trains. It was a crazy party and it was only 5pm! I only stayed until 11 since I was still a bit sore and worn out from my Iliniza climb.

I was about halfway through the book when I went to see the movie. I couldn’t wait anymore. I’m super glad I was impatient. I really liked it. Rooney Mara played Lisbeth Salander as the total badass I picture when I read the book, and literally every scene she was in was so arresting that I was almost hypnotized by her. There were definitely some down points in it… I find the actual mystery they’re investigating to be a bit of a non-starter, but that’s more an issue with the source material. I found the performances, across the board, to be excellent. Daniel Craig was believable as “not Bond”, Christopher Plummer was crazy good, and I loved all of the assorted Vanger family members. The Soundtrack was also excellent. Like… really excellent.

Since having kids, this time period of the software development life cycle is really difficult. Londo has to take on all the things I let go, from housework to dropping off kids. For a few days in a row, I had really long days in the office, barely seeing the kids in the morning and getting home after the kids were in bed. I wasn't able to keep up with the dishes or laundry or cleaning the kitty litter boxes. It was just crazy.

We made a plan that I would join Lisa on Thursday, February 24th. Let's just say that I couldn't have picked a better winter's day to do it although I really didn't get the true experience of some of the hardships of the mail carrier in the Canadian winter months. For the followers who live in sunnier climates, you may shudder at the thought of walking around in -10 degree Celsius (14 Degrees F) weather but we have had days this winter when the temperature dropped to -30 degrees Celsius which ends feeling more like -42 degrees Celsius with the windchill. On this particular day, we were blessed with a balmy -2 degrees Celsius and clear, dry sidewalks. I wore my running shoes and a couple of light layers. I even had to remove my hat as it was getting too warm after a while.

I call it “required” because our tour guide said that we had to go to 3 shopping places as part of the tour, despite our declarations that we DIDN’T want to go shopping. At least these 3 shopping sites were not just shops, but also included some sort of educational tour/lecture about the products. I’ve experienced this in other countries (most memorably Turkey and Nepal), and knew what to expect…..an interesting lecture, then a push to buy. Rather annoying, I thought, but at least we weren’t required to buy anything, and it’s always good to learn something new.
A lot of the time problems have a lot to do with other problems that haven’t been solved sufficiently.
We got a real Christmas tree this year and it smells so good in my house! The last few years I had a peacock theme, but this year I decided to go more classic with a burgundy red, light green and gold. I am also going to start giving the kids an ornament each year. Morgan is going to get a Disney ornament and Cam is going to get an animal ornament. I found the cutest animal ornaments at Macy's. I wanted to buy all of them, but I just got three. The lion below is one of them...I also got a bear and a fox. I am really regretting not buying more now! But, I want Cam to have a variety of ornaments, not all the same style...so hopefully they will come out with more cute animal ornaments next year!

I’ve been a keen photographer for many years, but until recently I had never had any success in photographing lightning. I also very rarely see lightning storms, so I hadn’t had much opportunity.

Roger Miller told Patsy Cline author Nassour that he and a friend went searching for survivors in the early hours of the morning: “As fast as I could, I ran through the woods screaming their names—through the brush and the trees, and I came up over this little rise, oh, my God, there they were. It was ghastly. The plane had crashed nose down.” Not long after the bodies were removed, scavengers came to take what they could of the stars’ personal belongings and pieces of the plane. Many of these items were later donated to The Country Music Hall of Fame, including Patsy’s beloved Confederate Flag cigarette lighter which played “Dixie”, her wrist watch, belt with ‘Patsy Cline’ studded across it and one of 3 pairs of her gold lame slippers which were featured on the revised version of her Showcase With The Jordanaires album. However, the white chiffon dress that Cline had worn for her last performance and the money bag carrying the star’s payment for their last concert were never found.
It's a stunning run through of this album that I have know for almost all of my life! It's faithful, yet so very fresh sounding. It sounds of it's time, yet still so futuristic. Russell seems to have unlimited energy, as he transports us back to the late 70's. The moment 'Tryouts For The Human Race' started, the whole venue seemed to be dancing, and they don't stop until the very last note of 'Number One Song In Heaven'. Every one of these six tracks is a masterpiece, and every one is perfectly performed... Russell still hitting that incredible falsetto on the chorus of 'Beat the Clock' with ease. Each track is greeting with an incredible reaction from the crowd, and the atmosphere is nothing short of electric (rather appropriately!). I'm left feeling breathless.

Sure, there are times when it's clear, even in those critique sessions, that someone was not reading my story at all carefully. And I couldn't blame myself for someone's misinterpretations if they just glanced it over while walking to class, because the reader has to assume some responsibility. But if someone read through my story at a reasonable pace, and they didn't "get" it, it was not because they were stupid. It's okay if your reader has to work a little-- some reads are more challenging than others, after all-- but they should not have to do most of the work, or even a lot of the work. The story should do it for them.

As I mentioned above, I have thoughts about the civil appeal, but once the McNeilage Tape came into the hands of the NotW the matter had to go to the police. If the NotW had kept it from the police and produced it at the appeal, then I am certain that the Appeal Court would have suspended the appeal and referred the matter to the police themselves.

I acquired one of those ridiculously cute sock blocker keychains recently, and decided I'd make it a little sock with my leftover Yarn Pirate from Ishbel (which is blocking as I type this)...it started off swimmingly, but, well, a picture is worth a thousand words...or in this case; five:
For aficionados who appreciate cut and couture, this day coat deserves closer examination. It is boxy and cut away from the body. It is pieced in large horizontal panels, giving a slightly segmented feeling, especially when it is worn. It has an ease and generous feel that was the antitheses of the corseted, cantilevered, padded and shaped 1950s Christian Dior ideal a decade earlier. The narrowest horizontal panel, about 4” wide, is at waist level (the bottom edge is also the opening to the left and right slash pockets), and becomes a loose, drape-y half belt at the back that holds in the fabric folds in soft box pleats. In a medium weight wool with an almost felt like surface, and in a quiet cream, this is luxurious Paris couture in the most discreet manner. Considering the great expense of Paris couture, a coat like this which sits away from the body, and would actually fit a range of sizes and weight fluctuations, might be considered a better investment than a fitted, limited use, gala gown.

Finally, I remembered something that I used to teach in the weight management classes when I worked at Curves. I told the women I worked with that it was okay for them to hear or feel their tummies rumbling a little. Most of us don’t pay very close attention to the messages our bodies send us. And even if we do notice we treat them more like the check engine light in our cars. It is afterall, only yellow–just a warning. I guess if it really wanted to get our attention it would turn red. Or just stop.
What happens when you explain all of that to a subjective atheist who continues to insist that you listen to them repeat over and over “I lack a belief in God, I lack a belief in God”? What if you tell them to make the claim that God does not exist, and then support it with arguments and evidence, but instead they keep leaving comments on your blog telling you again and again about their subjective state of mind: “I lack a belief in cupcakes! I lack a belief in icebergs!” What if they keep e-mailing you and threatening to expose you on Twitter for refusing to listen to them, or denounce you via skywriting: “Wintery Knight won’t listen to me! I lack a belief in crickets!”. I think at this point you have to give up and stop talking to such a person.
I’d have to say that my only criticism lies with the character of Natsuki. As a character, she feels more like a well-developed plot device than anything. While she eventually plays her part in the finale, up until then she doesn’t do much other than give Kenji an excuse for being with her family, and being the love-interest that motivates him into action.
We had an executive chef, but we did not need him, we had a general manager, but he was the big boss and was too busy with his own stuff to bother with the likes of us. Then we had the food and beverage manager and it was this man who was the one who ‘ran’ the hotel. For him we were the ‘doers’. It did not matter who did the job as long as it was done!! So for PK Mohankumar we were all the same, we weren’t individuals, we were the team!!
Amid the fallout from his departure last week, there was despondency among campaigners over the government’s failure to implement substantial improvements to a system that charities identified as “not fit for purpose” more than 18 months ago, but which is still being used to assess the fitness of 11,000 people a week.

If using tempeh, I sometimes steam it first if I want it softer but I didn’t this time. I split the tempeh in half so that I had two thin rectangles. The way I do this is to lay the tempeh on a cutting board, hold the top steady with the palm of my hand and with a knife, slice through it like I am splitting open a bagel. Then I cut each thin rectangle in half so I have 4 pieces.

9) In 1942, Walt was in attendance for the premiere of Bambi. In the dramatic scene where Bambi’s mother died, Bambi was shown wandering through the meadow shouting,’ Mother! Where are you, Mother?’ A teenage girl seated in the balcony shouted out, ‘ Here I am Bambi!’ The audience broke into laughter except for the red-faced Walt who concluded correctly that war-time was not the best time to release a film about the love-life of a deer.
Pregnant women should not take squawvine during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Some herbalists, however, recommend taking the herb during the eighth and ninth month to make labor easier. During those months, squawvine can be taken once or twice daily. It can be combined with raspberry leaves in this remedy to prepare for childbirth.
Tea is a beverage (infusion) made by steeping hot water with leaves from the plant, Camellia sinensis. All true tea, the hundreds of varieties in the tea shop, come from this single species, which is an amazing discovery for me personally. The difference between the kinds of tea sold is due to the cultivars, the place the tea plants are grown in, and more importantly, the way they are processed. Drinks that are labelled as tea, for instance, rooibos, mate, chamomile, spearmint etc are not technically, tea but are instead known as herbal tea which are nevertheless just as delicious.

Long time no update! Sorry for the lack of posts in the two-week span, but once exam period gets started I have to limit all possible distractions for maximum study effectiveness. Is it lame that I was actually to some extent, excited about midsems? ONLY because it means that we don't have assignments, because I perform much better under pressure in 1-2 hours rather than a few hours every night for a month to create ~3000 words. I have a pretty short attention span and if I have to do something not particularly enjoyable, I have to do it fast and push it out of the way asap. My first two exams went alright because I was pretty prepared, but I could kick myself for the third (last mid sem) because of a very embarrassing mistake, caused by too many hours watching Law and Order on TV and reading cases in my textbook involving bloody murders, torture, rape, and pedophilia - leading to me to write a rather inappropriate response to a question where the only offence involved was theft of a painting. I won't talk about it anymore because it will only get me more riled up!

Some of my frustration stems from the unbloggable stuff I wrote about awhile back. I can't say anything more about it for now, except that the legal system in this case has completely failed, and a young woman is going to pay the price for its failure. I have done everything I can, within the limits of the law, and I feel like I've let her down. Unfortunately the law "protects" her from those who want to help her, and leaves her vulnerable to those who want to hurt her. I can't do anything more for her without doing something that would land me in a lot of trouble. And that sucks.

Anyway, after helping to set up our picnic area (by delivering my assigned breakfast foods), chatting with group members, and a quick port-a-potty trip, I lined up with two of my running buddies who were hoping for the same pace as I was.

In the RT interview, Assange also talked about his experience of working with mainstream media companies like The Guardian and the New York Times. “Any organisation, once it grows to a sufficient size and has sufficient influence, starts having to make political compromises,” he said. “And media organisations, by their very nature, are engaged in the political sphere. So the editors and publishers of media organisations have to sit down at the table with power groups, and they start becoming captured by these power groups.”
Maurer admits that the aircraft has grown in weight, but an aggressive weight management program will enable Diamond to maintain a 5,690-lb. max ramp weight and 5,650-lb. MTOW in production aircraft. That provides a 350-lb. margin up to the 6,000-lb. weight limit for this class of EASA/FAR Part 23 aircraft. The production conforming D-Jet’s first flight could be as soon as second quarter 2013. Three production conforming aircraft will be used in the development program with the goal of achieving type certification and customer deliveries in the second half of 2014.

After claiming that it was the dolphin who made the first move Brenner says the dolphin “became more and more aggressive.” Well yeah…..the dolphin was probably a sex perv or something, no? Brenner claims that the dolphin “thrust herself against me.” Okkkkk well I’m sure that happens every day with these dolphin types doesn’t it?

The last time Ted Thompson drafted a little known Safety from a small school he had a hell of a career before it was derailed by injury. Of course we are talking about Nick Collins. McMillian is a sure tackling Safety that is and plays fast. He has the tools to become a very good Safety and possesses the qualities that Capers looks for in his safeties.
Ice cream is to me what water is to others. It is the source of my life. My body needs at least two scoops of ice cream everyday to function properly. At times, ice cream covers more than 70% of my tongue's surface, and at this rate, I'm afraid 60% of my body will be ice cream very soon.

Lloyd had sailed his ball some 300 yards down. But from the water’s edge, I had a decision to make. Either hit it across the lake and go for the green in three or lay up on the same side. I decided to take a chance and hit it over water. I chose my Callaway Diablo Edge 4-hybrid and hit it good. The ball ended up on the other side in the middle of the landing spot. My third shot would be short iron to the green which is guarded by water on the left. Lloyd had a 6-iron left and he hit it well. He gave out a loud yelp as his ball landed on the green. He was putting for eagle.
Zeke is gorgeous. He is cute, honest and funny. He is not devastating or unrealistic like so many romantic leads. He is real, he is believable and it is easy to see how anyone could fall in love with him. The romance between him and Allison is just perfect. It builds slowly, it is realistic. There is no insta-love here. No bolts of lightning when they touch. This is just two people getting to know each other and realising they have feelings for one another.

When campus administrators deploy the police against protesters, however, a third force enters the picture, and this force operates according to very different principles and aims than the other two. Initially, perhaps, the police appear as an arm of the administration, present to enforce the student code of conduct, and thus purportedly to maintain the integrity of campus rules and regulations. The police are ordered by the administration to try and re-open a barricaded classroom building, for instance, or to prevent students from camping on campus. But once they arrive at the site of a protest action, the police can't help but go beyond their initial charge. Because once the police issue a command to protesters, they fundamentally shift the ground of the interaction. What had initially appeared to be an issue of the student code of conduct and its violation, or a manifestation of a dispute about how to maintain the educational project of the university, has suddenly become an issue of legality and illegality, crime and policing. The terms and dynamics of the event have shifted radically.

After craving a slice of lemon meringue pie for a week, I decided to just make my own. I don't have a recipe, so I used one out of the Betty Crocker cookbook. It didn't thicken up as much as I hoped, so my slices don't really stay slices for long. It's still delicious and I'm still eating it, but does anyone out there have a better recipe? Preferably one that doesn't involve a jello pudding mix? I'm kind of snobby about that. I want it to be totally from scratch. Why? I don't know. No good reason. I'm weird.
It’s that time of year again, when we take a moment to look at our lives and realize we do have some great things to be thankful for. But for some reason we all seem to somehow forget about the people that interact with and lead us every day. Those people would be the teachers from right here at South Lancaster Academy. Sometimes we only focus on how many annoying homework assignments they give us or how many excruciating tests they hand out, but do we take a minute to think about how they help us out? Do we think about the ways that they try to help us get ahead?

First Contact is the only real highlight among TNG movies. It is not a perfect film by any measure, but its flaws are not so overwhelming they ruin the experience. Heck, even the sequence in which Cochran looks at Riker and says, ’so you’re all astronauts on some kind of star trek?” does not ruin it and line prompted the first audible full audience groan I have ever heard in a theater. True story.

Rather brief, isn’t it? Let me add a few things. Lacey is a young woman living in a small town in Arizona. She has gone about her business without incident for years but all of that changes one night when a harried woman sits down by her at the bar and asks if she believes in ghosts. Intrigued, the woman, a male friend of hers and Lacey decide to go visit the market which the woman owns and believes has suddenly sprouted a ghost.

Kessler, whose reporting partly led to the dismissal of FBI Director William Sessions in 1993, said Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan also needs to be fired, especially as this is the second major scandal he has presided over.

V-juice is apparently terrifyingly addictive, as Jason shows major withdrawal symptoms after his second use. Granted, his first use was something like 600 doses, but still it’s only been a few days since he’d never done it before. It’s interesting to me that it had a very different effect on Jason than on Sookie, as though the blood Sookie drank was used up healing her with only a little leftover side-effects.

They are listening to you, maybe not all the time, but regularly or periodically. They trust what you say because you’ve built a rapport and a relationship with them. They respond to you, either by means of comments or other online participation, or by telling others about you. They are communicating their concerns, needs, passions, and interests to you; thus you can know them better. And, most importantly, they are acting. They may be buying your products, telling other about them, commenting, recommending, rating, or taking any of the myriad of actions you provide for them to get involved.
But…what makes me laugh at this whole thing….my daughter asked me to excuse her from her first hour today. Why you ask? She received a love letter from a boy in that class and she didn’t want to face him. Ironic isn’t it? My response…”Man-up you can’t avoid it forever”. I then asked her if she wanted me to make her a sign.. in which she refused.

However I caught on to it. As work got crazier, and as my hour lunch got depleted, I decided to start bringing lunch into work. Honestly it has been the most effective thing in my diet. I guess it's the control I now have. Yes, I control my car driving me to Panera and my willpower is my own to order the panini that I crave so much all the time, but the extra calories are just too much right now. Instead home-made pizza works, a sandwich I made with a normal amount of cold cuts, and oooo the right snacks. I think it's all paying off.

With Morgan's support, Dekker was signed but did not record until 1963 because Kong wanted to wait for the perfect song, which "Honour Your Mother and Father" was felt to be. "Honour Your Mother and Father" was a hit and was followed by "Sinners Come Home" and "Labour for Learning", and at this time Desmond Dacres became Desmond Dekker. His fourth hit made him into one of the island's biggest stars. It was "King of Ska", a rowdy and jubilant song on which Dekker was backed by The Cherrypies (also known as The Maytals). Dekker then recruited four brothers, Carl, Patrick, Clive and Barry who became his backing band, The Four Aces.

It's a good thing that getting caught offside does not count as a foul, otherwise Tottenham Hotspur would be in trouble. Emmanuel Adebayor was the season's most prolific offender in that regard, reclaiming a crown that he previously won in 2008 and succeeding last year's most regular transgressor, Jermain Defoe, another two-times winner. In fairness, Darren Bent, another previous winner, was on course to challenge hard for this year's title until he fell victim to injury. But Bent's absence is only part of the reason why Aston Villa were the only team in the league not to score a single goal from a corner all season. They also scored fewer headers (three) than anyone else – while the only team to concede more headed goals than Villa (12) were Sunderland (13). West Bromwich Albion conceded the fewest (five). Villa's total of seven victories was their lowest in a season since 1890‑91, when there were only 12 teams in the league.
Benson has such a stong trunk and is starting to be able to sit up by himself with our watch and help with balance of course. It is amazing how well he does though. He also loves standing while being supported at the arms.
So why did Friedan work so hard to hide her past? Why did she insist that she had no political involvement when she was clearly a radical activist for a number of years? According to Horowitz, Friedan probably did much of this out of fear. McCarthyism silenced an entire generation of activists, and Friedan was a part of this group. She undoubtedly feared that if her past were to come out it would not only harm herself and her family, but also the feminist movement. Friedan understood the importance of appealing to the American mainstream, which at the time was suburban housewives. If it came out that the leader of this movement was a former radical and potential Communist, she would have lost a great deal of support from important and influential backers.

The morning was cold and clear, about 13 degrees on the car thermometer, calm and very dark out there away from habitation and lights. The stars were absolutely incredible. It warmed up into the 60′s and then cooled again to the 30′s over the course of the day. Minimal wind and lots of sun made for a beautiful day to be out in the hills.
While this is a beautiful blush to look at with it's pink to purple ombre, it is not the greatest quality. I find that the texture is quite firm and the finish is a bit powdery when you try to pick the product up with a brush. Pigmentation isn't so hot either. I don't have dark skin (I'm NW20) but I do have to layer this on for it to show up. That said, the colour is pretty: a cool lilac tinted pink.

It's election day and hopefully everyone across the country is getting ready to head into voting booths to pull the lever for their favorite candidates. I used to work on political campaigns so I am always filled with excitement and pride on this very special day. For campaign operatives, there is little to do the night before the election but just wait it out until the next day for "get out the vote efforts." I used to have a hard time sleeping the night before election day and had to do something with my nervous energy. For those of you who knew me during that time, you probably remember what I did. BAKE! I would bake away my big chocolate chip cookies all night and then bring them in the next day to share with the whole campaign team. In honor of my old tradition and election day, I've attached this great election day cookie recipe that I found from the Taste of Home site.

I’m not positive that there is definitely a connection between working at my job and being single, but I sure wouldn’t be surprised if there was some sort of correlation. There might be some holes in my thought process, but then again, this isn’t necessarily something I want to test out either. All I know is that if I stay at this job much longer, there is a likely chance I could end up lumped together with my co-workers in the single department.

There is thus no doubt in my mind that God, at the dawn of civilization, utilized Cain’s superhuman intelligence for the long-term benefit and progress of all humanity. I may be wrong, but it seems as if part of God’s plan with mankind was to delay progress at various intervals, and to give man time to contemplate and learn from past errors, past deceptions, and past wars. It is regrettable that so much blood had to flow, BUT by what other means does one write the law into the hearts and minds of men, than by instruction through trial and error, and also -- bloodshed?
The longer I’m in ministry, however, the more I see how prayer can be abused if we’re not careful. One way I see this happening is through the use of the words, “Let me pray about that first”. This phrase is most often used in response to one Christian asking another Christian to make a decision that will involve some sacrifice. The situation could look like someone in church leadership asking a young couple in the body to teach a children’s Sunday school class or it could look like one brother exhorting another to ask forgiveness of someone he’s sinned against. Certainly this phrase has often been used legitimately – a person sincerely takes the time to ask God for wisdom and discernment in making a decision and giving an answer. But too frequently it can be used to stall until a sufficient excuse can be conjured up or used as a “holy” deflection tactic (i.e. – If you pray about it and say “no”, I can’t really exhort you further because you’ve already gone to the boss with my request).

Marilyn Volkman currently lives and works in Chicago. She received her MFA from the University of Chicago in 2009 and her BFA from the University of Arizona in 2007. Using art as a strategy for reconfiguring our use of language, images and objects, her work takes on diverse forms including object arrangements, paintings, social interactions and quasi-documentary video projects. Volkman’s work is often site specific and developed in collaboration with particular groups, collective communities and organizations. Her most recent projects have taken place in the commercial marketing firm Cutters, in downtown Chicago, at the U.S. Army’s Intelligence Center on Fort Huachuca, Arizona, and at the NATO Command Headquarters in Brunssum, Netherlands.
I found this recipe on the Gourmet Slueth website recently and since I love the lettuce wraps at PF Changs, I figured why not give it a whirl? There are of course recipes online for their lettuce wraps and I have one of them printed out of course... But the appeal for me with these? They looked light, COOL!

While circus (like all live entertainment) was certainly once more prevalent in American society, it is a testament to its power and resilience that it remains a part of our lives to this day. Vaudeville, which placed its chips on a different model depending on a physical infrastructure (the theatre chains) went the way of the dodo. (It needn’t have been so, by the way. In the early days, folks like M.B. Leavitt, Weber and Fields and Tony Pastor crossed the country with touring vaudeville companies. Come to think of it, there’s no reason such an idea couldn’t be revived).

In the middle image above, you can look through to OUR apartments on the other side of the street.
It had rained for several days previously so there was a very nice haze rising from the ground, which when backlit, looks absolutely incredible and there was also huge piles of mud all around us. At first I thought about just trying to shoot action images as the guys played football but that proved to not be the best idea, I hadn’t considered the difficulty of lighting them while they moved. Many out-of-focus and poorly lit images later, I abandoned the idea and set up my lights for more controlled action. Below are a few outtakes from my attempts at capturing action.

I didn't get a picture of it but I used clear elastic and a zig-zag stitch to make the sleeve gathers. The hems were done with a twin needle and walking foot. Oh, and I used french seams for all seams except the sleeve/armhole.
Donna looked to both. “I-” and she stopped, looking up towards the stairs. The man was coming down the stairs slowly, carefully keeping his hands close to himself. He strode to the kitchen, found a small towel, and returned to the living room. He wiped at the doorknob and the banister, starting from the bottom and wiping the rail up to the top. After about a minute, he wiped the banister again on the way down. He used the towel to open the front door, then he wiped the other side of the doorknob and the storm door handle before leaving. Donna’s eyes followed him until he was gone. The confusion on her face stood in contrast to the grimness held by Chris and Ann.

As the increase of AFV’s enter the marketplace, the supplemental demand and necessity of having the capacity to effectively service and repair such vehicles is apparent. Go-Green Auto Centers will establish centers throughout the United States and abroad by educating, training and certifying existing auto service and repair stations. These centers will be “Go-Green Auto Centers Certified” which will allow them to service all AFV’s . At present, we have entered into a firm relationship with the state university system, a leader in technology training and development in gas engines and alternative fuels. Farmingdale State University will facilitate and provide the online certification course. Additional partnerships beneficial to the success of the company are being formed now. We have experienced a great deal of support and accessibility from accomplished scientific minds, politicians and Green-movement advocates in the industry.
Jeaniene Frost! Hello, got to read her books if you love paranormal romance. First are the Night Huntress books, covering the stories of Cat and Bones. “Hello Kitten,” will always make you smile after reading these books. From that series she spun off the Night Huntress World Books, these books give us the stories of the secondary characters from the main series.

No matter what faith or path you follow, the relationship between religion and suffering comes up sooner or later. One of the atheist arguments is that religion clearly doesn’t work, god does not intervene, cruelty and injustice continue. What many religions offer are ideas about the true source of human unhappiness, and how to deal with it. The idea that you can be saved from suffering by following the edicts of a religion doesn’t stand any scrutiny at all. What you might get are some tools that enable you to handle it better.

Technically speaking, Binary Domain is a squad-and-cover-based third-person shooter, which probably makes it sound very much like Gears of War, a series which I loathe and detest. (Well, to be fair to it, I only loathe and detest the first one, but that put me off ever playing the other two.) But in execution it manages to be so much more than the thick necks and testosterone of Epic’s title, and in the process it highlights the differences between Japanese and Western development. It’s also helping further cement the feeling I’ve been having recently that Japanese games are, for the most part at least, preferable to Western — for me, anyway.
At the same time, Dave began pursuing his post-graduate degree. Any flux in his schedule was swallowed up by studying–after work and on the weekends. My days were full of two rambunctious little boys, errands, and….those other constant companions. Our once blissful marriage began to deteriorate. Instead of building one another up, Dave and I exchanged sarcastic remarks or avoided talking altogether. Rather than cuddling, we sat at opposite ends of the couch. We were lonely–in the same house, in the same room, and even in the same bed.

I worked one night as a supposed prop assistant, but I didn't do anything. I just sat in the front row, dressed in black, afraid I would be asked to contribute in some way. Luckily for my nerves, I wasn't made to do any actual work. I was also not asked to join the cast. I didn't press the issue.

To those who have looked at life through only one set of lenses it can be difficult to acknowledge the value of other points of view. Let me challenge you with a football metaphor… When you see a play in real time you are sure he caught the ball in bounds. When you see it in slow motion (from your point of view) you become even more sure of your belief. But… when you see the play from one of the other camera angles you are able to give credence to another point of view and give in to a different conclusion or at least grant allowance for another’s perspective. A small problem here is that we are often influenced from our coach or other players, even fans to see what we want to see. Sometimes no one really knows, but at least in football a conclusion must be given so that the show can go on.
At the April 10 launch, invited guests gathered at the historic Smiths Creek Depot inside Greenfield Village to hear details about the dramatic progress expected, and to receive thanks for their support.
I think that the "helpful" and "cooperation" charts have been helpful in giving me a tool to teach her what these things are. I have discovered in this parenting gig, that I am not a natural teacher and I need all the tools I can.
The incident was recalled similarly by five students, who gave their accounts independently of one another. Four of them — Friedemann, now a dentist; Phillip Maxwell, a lawyer; Thomas Buford, a retired prosecutor; and David Seed, a retired principal — spoke on the record. Another former student who witnessed the incident asked not to be named. The men have differing political affiliations, although they mostly lean Democratic. Buford volunteered for Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008. Seed, a registered independent, has served as a Republican county chairman in Michigan. All of them said that politics in no way colored their recollections.

Earlier today I spend several hours outside to different Job Centres in Cardiff leafleting for the Youth Fight for Jobs (YFJ) demonstration on Wednesday at the Welsh Assembly. As such a had the opportunity to discuss politics with a lot of people as they were hanging around waiting for their appointments in the job centre. I heard the same thing from each person I spoke to. The anger was most certainly there but so was the demoralisation.
Once EJ was safely in and dry at the holiday club, it was time to set off for work, I walked very fast to work; I couldn’t believe the weather and was glad to get to work, albeit at 8.03am. I asked my boss (Jase) if it was ok for me to work till 4.30pm as I got here early and it was far too horrid weather to sit outside for half an hour, he agreed (as long as I didn’t make a habit of it and stick to my agreed hours). I worked till 4.30pm then walked home, luckily by this time it had stopped raining!

After that I brought her home and took my Dziadziu (grandfather) grocery shopping. I’m going to make them a roast beef dinner on Saturday…hopefully I don’t kill the roast haha It’s hard to good meat when you don’t normally good meat lol right?

The mobility allows me to track a single insect as it moves around, and capture different shots, and perspectives, on the same individual. This is critical for identification, since I don't know until later what the key features to look for might be. It's often some tiny detail, only revealed from some obscure angle, that distinguishes the species.
Within the mentally challenged community, enthusiasm is an essential element. Whether you are driving a van, leading praise and worship, teaching or preaching, your members will catch your attitude and your joy. They will also adopt your distrust and lack of contentment if you put it on display. Often, before our executive director, Richard Stimson, brings correction of our membership, he will say, “You know I love you, don’t you? I have to say this even though it makes me sad that it might hurt you. I’m going to say this because I love you so much.”
Even our own hearts can turn against our self.

I finally got around to taking pictures of our house. It has only taken me five months! With getting morning sickness so bad, I wasn't up to decorating, cleaning, or organizing much. I wanted to get it to where I liked most of it before I started taking pictures. I have been able to get a few craft/home decor things done so it looks much better but I still have many more projects up my sleeves to make this house our own!

Fuck she smells incredible, like freesia and honeysuckle. The fresh scent, only that of a woman he lusted after could make him lose the willpower to pounce on her right then. Something about this female made all logic leave his brain, something he couldn’t explain. Her mind wasn’t guarded any longer and he read every carnal thought running through her mind. And she turned him on. He struggled to compose himself.

3. Noise pollution: There are a lot of popular spots around Taiwan, where stalls and shops use megaphones to attract customers. I'm not sure, how much revenue this method brings in, but to my ears it's purely annoying. The biggest shocker for me was when an uncle blasted into the crowds awaiting the Alishan sunrise at 5am in the morning (see video above). Peacefully enjoying the awakening of the morning on Alishan? 沒辦法! I know a lot of young Taiwanese are not happy with these megaphone-culture as well.
I had dodged a bullet, but one I never saw coming. This is the story.
Now I know I too am like my parents in various ways, both positive and negative, but how much do I reflect my heavenly Father in my daily life in a way that honours him? Do people see God in me in the words I write and speak? I am created in God’s image, Genesis 1:27 tells us, but just how clear is that image and ‘family likeness’ to those around me?

I describe the opening scene as a Hitchcockian MacGuffin because, really, it does not matter what the protagonists are arguing about. The plot is that four people – two couples – argue throughout with each other in varying configurations. What they argue about is almost irrelevant. The plot is the psychological arc of their arguing though, it has to be said, it is aimless and, ultimately, reaches no climactic end resolution.
Research money should be spent on biomedical Myalgic Encephalomyelitis research and not on psycho nonsense,” says Dr. Behan, a retired Harvard trained neurologist and psychiatrist who became a world expert on the physiological nature of ME (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome) in his practice at Southern General Hospital in Glasgow.

I experience this move as looking inward, not outward, for answers – as recognizing that I already possess what I need. This move makes me think of the Zen saying: “If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him,” which refers not to literal homicide, but to turning away from external values and systems of authority so as to discover a deeper and more authentic Truth within.
I went home at that point. And I swore I would never, ever go on a blind date again.
Whilst they remained silent about the South African genocide, just what did the effluent in human form, who's poison which they have the nerve to call 'journalism' dribbles out of those poor man's Andrex substitutes The Guardian, the independent, the Observer and the Mirror choose to write about? What was it that those, politically motivated, white guilt riddled, hacks, who view a white man with a leaflet as more dangerous than a black man with a machete considered more worthy on their newsprint?

Trayvon’s parents and civil rights leaders spoke after a dramatic police account of the fatal shooting claimed the black teen launched an unprovoked attack on the neighborhood watch volunteer in which he punched him in the face, knocked him to the ground and then bashed his head into the sidewalk several times before trying to grab his gun.

I reflected on everything as Joe drove me home. Was this his idea of a date? Was this what he did with girls? I made some small talk as we pulled into my driveway.

Song of Solomon starts with the Shulamite woman saying to Solomon, her beloved, “May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine” (SOS 1:2). He calls her “most beautiful” (1:8) and she calls him “handsome” (1:16). In verses 12-13, she speaks of a pouch of myrrh between her breasts giving off a fragrance. This happened when a woman’s body heat increased. In other words, her heart is beating for him! She wants Him. He wants her. They are married, and this book is an 8 chapter celebration on the physical, emotional, and spiritual joys of living marriage in the way that God wants.

In Matthew 22:37 -39 (NKJV), Jesus said, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” In John 6:40, (KJV), Jesus goes on to say, “And this is the will of Him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.”

OK, Now I have spent many years in school, elementary, junior high and high school, 4 years of undergrad in New Hampshire and 4 years of Vet School. I must confess, as I approach mid life, I struggle more and more remembering what I spent a lot of time, not to mention money to learn.
I invited Friend SH to share in my taco fest and what a fest it was. I bought really delicious Pacific cod, all organic vegetables, and created this dish in about 30 minutes. One really marvelous thing about fish is its quick cooking speed. Once I had the fish marinated, it was only minutes until I had it in a taco that was rapidly making its way towards being completely consumed. It's super light; light enough that I reasoned, "Hey - I can eat three of these." And I did. Because I wanted to. For the moment, how ever temporary and brief, I only thought of me.
I really love this tote bag available from Pariseau's Market. It features a new canna lily leaf unfurling. The prominent stripes add to the focus of intrigue.

I’d say that you might have heard that I was successful in business. And that rumor is true. But you might not have heard that I became successful by helping start a business that grew from 10 people to hundreds of people. You might not have heard that our business helped start other businesses, like Staples and Sports Authority and a new steel mill and a learning center called Bright Horizons. And I’d tell you that not every business made it and there were good days and bad days, but every day was a lesson. And after 25 years, I know how to lead us out of this stagnant Obama economy and into a job-creating recovery!

This went on for a while… and it was very painful. Before I answered his first question about being Christian and going to church I contemplated lying and saying yes I am super Christian and love going to church every weekend because I had a feeling I was not going to like the rest of that conversation. After those 30 minutes, I honestly wish I had lied to him. I know it’s terrible, but it was that painful. And I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything else because we were alone in a car in the middle of Seoul traffic on a Saturday afternoon. He had this same conversation with K. two days later, who of course was not going to just let Mr. Lee be Mr. Lee. I believe he said something along the lines of, “okay, I get your point about needing to know where we come from. So if it’s true we came from God, then where did he come from? Where is his origin?” K. tells me he merely repeated what he’d been saying for the last 5 minutes for the next 25 minutes (as he did with me). Mr. Lee later told me that K.’s school loves him, but I have the distinct impression that Mr. Lee doesn’t because of that argument. Oh and don’t forget about an hour later in that car when I commented about all the monochromatic colors of Korean cars… and he basically said to me, “that’s normal all over the world, you must not have been paying much attention to the colors of the cars around you for the last 23 years. Oh, and any colors you did see, it was probably some woman… women, and their colored cars. Sheesh.”

And the cross-sectioning just shows how utterly delicious it is. The crust isn't a typical pie crust; it's more like a biscuit crust with a wee bit of shortbread, if anything. But it soaks up all of the delicious juices that the rhubarb releases, besides being tasty, so I really can't quibble about whether it's a pie or a cake or some sort of hybrid.
Shale gas drilling in Europe is now revealing what was earlier revealed in the United States. The industry's so-called "manufacturing model"--the idea that one could sink a well virtually anywhere in a shale gas deposit and get economically viable flows--is being discredited all over again. Former U.S. Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill once said, "All politics is local." It turns out that all shale gas drilling is local as well. Shale gas fields have sweet spots worth exploiting, but also contain vast areas that will likely never be economical to produce.

“I have made the heavens and the earth, I have ordered the mountains, I have created all that is above them, I have made the water, I have made to come into being the great and wide sea, I have made the ‘Bull of his mother,’ from whom spring the delights of love. I have made the heavens, I have stretched out the two horizons like a curtain, and I have placed the soul of the gods within them. I am he who, if he openeth his eyes, doth make the light, and, if he closeth them, darkness cometh into being. At his command the Nile riseth, and the gods know not his name. I have made the hours, I have created the days, I bring forward the festivals of the year, I create the Nile-flood. I make the fire of life, and I provide food in the houses. I am KhepeRA in the morning, I am RA at noon, and I am Tmu at evening.”

The cats are sort of fat, and since switching dog food the dog has been pooping in the house and acting weird. But how do you choose a better kibble? The Internet is surprisingly uncooperative in this regard, since it seems like everyone is trying to sell you their food, and there's not much that feels independent. I've decided on Wellness food, because really I still don't know anything but it looks OK and certainly tons better than Beneful. Mostly meat, plus veggies. Not mostly corn filler crap and coloring. It cost me almost over $75 for food for all the pets, but what can you do? Keep feeding your kids Taco Bell and Twinkies? Look at that face!

After getting dropped off in the centre of town we find some deep fried chicken and greasy chips in the lazy, shady plaza. Groups of young Latino men in baggy shorts and basketball boots escape the heat of the sun under large trees. Smoking cigarettes and passing bottles concealed in brown paper bags, they look at us with mild curiosity as we pass. A black man in a business suit hurries past, impatiently swerving around our lumbering backpacks and pushing into the bank. A police man cradling a shotgun stands under the tall yellow church, sweeping a disinterested gaze over the people. I get the feeling that today is a day just like any other for these people. In a way it is for us too - although we’re surrounded by strange accents, new sights, and a different way of life to wrap our heads around, as a backpacker you are faced with these changes all the time and you quickly learn

By this time, Steve and I had been at Levon's place for about three hours, and it became apparent that Levon was excited to have us involved in the documentary he was planning. I knew that my contribution to this project would be minimal--this was Steve's baby all the way--but I was nonetheless ecstatic over the possibilities. When it came time for us to leave, Levon disappeared for a minute, then came back into the great room and thanked us for visiting him. He shook my hand, and as he did so, he slipped a big fat joint into the breast pocket of my shirt. "I wanna tell you what a pleasure it was to meet you, Dean. Here's a little somethin' for the road."
When you loose your eyesight, your hearing goes bad, your appetite diminishes, your balance is off, and your always cold - the quality of life becomes a day to day struggle.

The "People of Walmart" comment is spot on, and I suspect these two would take it as a compliment. No one expects middle aged college professors to look like, say, Helen Mirren, but this level of slovenliness and unprofessionalism as to personal appearance gives an awful impression of the university.
Yesterday I returned to the doctor to find out about my eye. After several tests and a lot of nerves, the results came. And the verdict.....inconclusive. That's much better than what I could have heard, yet it is still not, "no cancer." There are more tests to come (some blood work, an optical scan, and if need be, some type of micro-biopsy). I have eye drops to use daily ($109 for a bottle that insurance wouldn't pay for).

I used to love cooking. I was a huge fan of recipe magazines and cookbooks (see evidence in photo of a small portion of my collection). Always looking for something new to try. The Builder and I used to have at least one new dish to try each week, if not more. I hated eating the same thing two weeks in a row.
Such thoughts arose recently when I continued to meet new people. I noticed how I had this inherent trust for some people I might never have met, and after meeting, realise that we clicked far better than imagined. Instinctively, I had faith that things were certain and nothing could go wrong – and even if it did, they can be trusted to help fix the problems. I recall how I’d met some interesting characters at the start of the year and how we managed to coordinate our actions and thoughts so well together that everything seemed to work out perfectly even at crunch time. I thought about the individual who had agreed to a last-minute request with only a brief verbal acknowledgement, then delivered on the promise beyond what I’d expected. I then think about how just a week ago I’d encountered yet another character who was amazingly different from my impression but we turned out to be highly aligned in various aspects.

All of these dishes were vegetarian, and tasted delicious. I quickly found out that vegetarian food was not as horrible as I planned it would be. This made me quickly feel jubilant in my choice of sustainability promise. I have already decided to continue being a flexitarian once this class is over. Yes, some other PSP (not flushing to toilet after I pee or hang drying my clothes) would have been easier to do, but I feel like being a flexitarian will definitely help me live a better and healthier lifestyle into my future. Being flexitarian will allow me to buy less meat, which will help do my part is helping reduce the abusive food industry. And when I do eat meat, I will make sure that I buy from local farms, because the images from Food Inc. are still seared in my mind. The cow feeds that are currently being used by the industry are vast farms that are stuff packed with cattle. They are fed corn, which is not in their natural eating habits, and they are so tightly packed that it is almost impossible to move. The non-stop eating and lack of movement makes the cattle abnormally fat and immobile. They end up covered in their own manure and then are slaughtered. This is just not the way that our meat should be given to us. Instead, the cattle should be on open farms grazing on grass. Here are some pictures to help show what I just talked about:

Be sure to make an appointment ahead of time (ask your stylist) so you can get your hair into the best condition (ask about color options too!) possible for that big day. Try on different styles until you find that perfect one that pleases your bride but most of all makes you feel beautiful and ready for anything!
I should also confess that my boss found 20p on the ground on the way to Tesco, gave it to me and I spent it on two Freddos. They were heavenly.
Premise (3) follows logically from the conjunction of (1) and (2). The problem for Craig — or, rather, the problem that we will be considering today — is that (3) does not provide support for the existence of God. If we left the Kalam at (3), the most we could say is that there has to be some cause for the existence of the universe; but we couldn’t say whether that cause is divine or non-divine. The Kalam needs a second stage.

In this context, it is worth pointing out that, at present, a quarter of the council’s total grants go to two companies, the Australian Opera and the Australian Ballet. In fact, the Australian Opera, along with the accompanying orchestra, actually obtains more in grants than the Literature Board and the Visual Arts Board combined.

I don't remember the first time I had gnocchi. I don't remember where I was, who I was with, or even if it happened earlier than a few years ago (it totally did). But I do remember a lingering fondness for these soft little potato pillows. A fondness that prompted me to make my own, and discover how such simple ingredients can be turned into something impeccable.
Tonight’s Numbers:
With our local preschool co-op, we took the kids outside and we built a scale model of our solar system using various balls as props. This really gives the kids an idea of how large our solar system is. We used a 16 foot wide sun made out of old yellow sheets sewn together. For the rest of the planets we used various balls that were aproximatly the correct diameter. If you want to replicate this experiment at home, you can use this cool calculator to determine the sizes and distances of your "to scale" model.

#728 - Louisiana Story (1948) - (#985 on TSPDT) Such a simple film, a boy and his pet raccoon lazing their way through the bayou, with occasional visits to the world's friendliest oil rig, but so damn mesmerizing. Flaherty's final film and the ethnographic documentarian's finest and most beautiful work. I first heard of this film way back when I was just getting into the world of cinema, while perusing the BFI's Sight & Sound lists of the greatest films (it was on the original 1952 list, above Rules of the Game and Citizen Kane, the latter of which did not even make the list), but for one reason or another, I did not catch up on it only now. Well, I suppose I can say it was worth the wait indeed.

The crowd is at a fever pitch, still hyped off of the aftermath of the latest pay-per-view. Every match on the card had been a wonder to behold, from the customary tag match showcasing everyone who wasn’t important to the traditional woman’s match that nearly stole the show. Championships changed hands from the bottom of the totem pole to the highest, but no one could have prepared for the upset that was the main event. The fan favorite champion, the heel with a cause, came to the ring with his belt firmly wrapped around his waist, middle fingers pointed to the crowd that loved him as he approached the ring. And who was already in the ring but his opponent? Kind of short, slightly less athletic than the champ, hair looking as if the man’s barber had become a social pariah, the challenger stood in the ring. He was known, but people still questioned exactly why he was in the match at all. Sure, he’d won a few matches. He’d even claimed a non-title win over the champion. But what was he known for other than his promos featuring the consumption of chicken?
I then moved onto the Hogwarts Crest. This is going to be a birthday piece for James. I had started this as part of the crazy challenge and was doing one over two on 36 ct but when I took it out again I just didn't like the coverage so I frogged what I'd done and redid it two over two on the 36ct. I'm much happier with this now.
The making of an icon, Chrysography, means “writing in gold,” and these works, meant as mediators between humans and God, imprint the guilded light of piety and age on your heart. Lovingly crafted and full of the force of tradition and meditation, icons remain the ultimate dream of art. Although that dream is impossible to find these days, great power comes from staring into the eyes of those that dreamt it.

Perhaps the most surprising element in the Duffer story is the involvement of Grammy and Tony award-winning composer Galt MacDermot (Hair), whose piano-based score played up the film's melancholia and black comedy, giving it a rueful, quirky air. Dumaresq and MacDermot were by now close friends and collaborators. Despins remembers their association: “Galt came over to London a number of times. I think he came over for Duffer. Some of the songs were sung by Bill and Galt. They would sometimes make demos at a little demo studio, Galt on piano and both of them singing together. Bill would bring me the demos and I would just transfer them to 16mm.”
Frustrated, I headed down the escalator to make my way out of the store, only to come face to face with a whole section of Michael Kors clothing, and there, front and center, were the red pants I'd wanted all along.

This is a load of lies. Since the Darfur crisis started, Egypt has taken 2 million Sudanese refugees. The comparable figure for Israel would be 200,000. Instead, Israel has a meager 17,000 illegal residents from all of Africa. Indeed, Israel, one of the richest countries in the world, is set apart from Egypt, one of the poorest, in that the latter has been immensely more generous in absorbing Darfur refugees. It is also set apart from other advanced economies: it has the lowest percent of temporary refugee status requests granted compared to western states - 1% in 2005, under 0.5% in 2006, and in 2007, 350 refugees got temporary protection, 805 others were denied, and 863 were under review, after which most were rejected.
The argument that beer has no place in a commemoration of Australia’s most significant actions on the world stage rides a bit thin with me as well.

Nearly 80 parolees were arrested and more than 20 weapons seized during what was billed Thursday as the largest sweep of its kind in the history of Los Angeles County. Called Operation Disarm, the sweep targeted parolees with felony convictions for gun crimes. By late morning, police had arrested 77 parolees primarily because they had guns and recovered 21 guns, more than 150 rounds of ammunition and drugs that included marijuana and cocaine, the Governor's Office said.

The high point of the paper is probably the studies of coinfection of mice with multiple Plasmodium strains. This is where local mate competition theory was directly tested. When strains were studied individually in a host, the sex ratio should be heavily female-skewed. However, when multiple strains are present, local mate competition theory predicts that more males will be produced. Exactly this pattern was observed, with a single-genotype infection sex ratio of about 15% males compared to a six-genotype infection sex ratio of about 44% males just before parasite load peak. Reece and coworkers also did a similar study with only two competing strains. With two out of three combinations a significant difference in sex ratio was observed, but it is not clear why the third strain did not modify sex ratio in response to co-infection. This strain was the least virulent, so there may be factors related to virulence and reproductive strategies that remain to be examined.

If you don't get back before dark, this gate will be locked, and you've got a two mile detour to get back to your car. That's something to keep in mind as you begin your hike.

In two of his later most brilliant plays Jumpers and Travesties from the 70s, he succeeds in his aim of contriving what he once described as: “The perfect marriage between the play of ideas and Farce and, or even high-comedy. While presenting dazzling displays of verbal wit and spectacle, he demonstrates by theatrical means, the difficulty of arriving at value judgements in a world where absolutes no longer have universal or even widespread support; where moral, social, religious,political even aesthetic points of view are subject to the laws of relativity.
Man on a Ledge stars Sam Worthington (Avatar, Wrath of the Titans) as Nick Cassidy, an ex-cop who escapes from prison to plan the ultimate heist: steal a $40 million diamond from a cutthroat businessman, and in the process prove his innocence.

Man on a Ledge bonus materials include “The Ledge” – a “making of” featurette and a trailer audio commentary by Elizabeth Banks.
So what is the bottomline? The French don’t dance tango well because their culture is quite distant from the spirit of tango and because they don’t want to study and really live into it. And what is good in French tango? The idea of dancing your own ‘Tango in Paris’, where of course you can have some super tantas with some excellent partners. The live orchestras which in France I’ve found superior to every other place in Europe. But most of all, it’s the ‘avant garde’… It’s the French touch! It is true that by analysing everything, taking nothing for granted and trying to make the breakthrough all the time (without often having the necessary base), the French cannot offer you e.g. the consistency and the balanced quality of the Italian tangeros…

Okay, so it doesn’t look so appetizing but let me describe what’s going on in this mess. The eggs were mixed with few spoonfuls of heavy whipping cream and scrambled in a pan of sautéed slivers of green onions (white parts only). When the eggs are still a bit “wet,” I sprinkled the chopped chives (mostly for color?). Upon plating, I topped the eggs with Costo S.Salmon bits and drizzled the mixer of creme fraiche, fresh lemon juice, grated lemon rind, and some salt and pepper all over this (you don’t need much really). The creme fraiche is little too thick for me — like greek yogurt — so we add more lemon juice to give it the tanginess we like. This also makes the sauce a little watery and not so visually appealing (use your dirty imagination). But it’s all going in the same place (and out the same place, hopefully) so does it really matter?

Heat olive oil in a medium-sized pot, over medium heat. Add onions, stir to coat, and cook until translucent. Stir in garlic, ginger, and spices, cook for another couple minutes (your kitchen will smell amazing at this point). At this point, add in cauliflower and/or carrots, as well as lentils and broth. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lentils are soft and creamy, and most of the liquid has been absorbed. If the mixture gets too dry before the lentils are fully cooked, just stir in a bit more broth (or water). Stir in remaining vegetables, continue to simmer until they are just cooked through (this time can vary from just a couple minutes for spinach to longer for broccoli or kale). Ladle into individual bowls, and top each with a spoonful of yogurt.

One of the five had lived on her property, without her permission, for a month before the killing. Two months before her husband died, this young man visited her husband saying he was the local secretary of the ANC and that he represented the farm workers. He sat in their living room and her husband gave him tea, drove him to the nearest town after their meeting and paid for his taxi fare back to Johannesburg. He told her husband his workers “hated” him. Mrs. Viljoen tried to remove some antagonistic former workers from her farm. She paid them off and even offered to build dwellings in town for them, but they wouldn’t budge. They informed her the houses on the farm which her husband built “belong to the state”.
However, teaching a foreign language may be approached differently, depending on the institution. Community colleges have a different method than universities. Student bodies have different demographics and, thus, different learning styles. The more a student pays for tuition is proportional to the motivation to study (Day). But the factor which generally remains constant is the xenophobic tendency to disregard the importance of a superior experience when learning a foreign language. This cannot happen if immersion is forced upon beginning foreign language students. It overwhelms the organized institutions to adapt the immaculate methods and botch up the flawless style with new unpleasant techniques. If those students who wish to attend community colleges, or for that matter universities, do not wish to put for the effort involved with communicating, let them be dumb and remain confined to their native lands. As it is, either contradictory or not, we shall refute these supposedly revolutionary methods, and opt instead for the grandeur of appropriate academic study.

Ryman’s ability to fluidly work out self-proposed problems is apparent at many points during the exhibition. In certain works, Ryman layers color without allowing the struggle between figure and ground that occurs in gestural abstraction.

Fundamentally as Iain stressed on several occasions, the council needs to have the resources available to it to provide services like bin collections etc. From the hustings it was clear that none of the other parties had a strategy on these questions, instead merely swallowing the Tory cuts and repeating their line that there isn’t an alternative.

Barbara was such a humble servant of the Lord. Her favorite phrase was: "It’s not the bush, but God in the bush, and any old bush will do!" She must have told us at least a thousand times (at least 200 times over the past 5 months) that her faith, hope and love comes from Christ in her. That anything we do for Him and for others is Christ in us. This is an extension of her favorite verse - Phil 2:13 and also Galatians 2:20.

DVD Extras: The commentary features Milton Johns, Martin Friend (Styggron, the lead Kraal), Hinchcliffe, and Marion McDougal, who was a production assistant on this story. There’s a somewhat apologetic making of doc entitled “The Village That Came to Life” that runs for 30 minutes. The piece goes back to the village that the story was shot in, and interviews some folks who were there back in the 70s, which is pretty cool. “Life After Who – Philip Hinchcliffe,” hosted by his daughter, is another 30-minute piece that’s title is pretty self-explanatory. There’s a Weetabix commercial, which may be the coolest extra on here. Also, there’s the usual photo gallery, production notes subtitle option, and Radio Times listings in PDF form, as well as bunches of Weetabix promo stuff that’s more loads of fun.

Of course it’s better if you have some kind of pig meat on the side (isn’t everything?) and a cup of green tea or orange juice, or both, mmm. Then for the final, final, final touch? Drum roll please. Mix in some close embrace, barefoot kitchen dancing with the love of your life…and there you have it, a perfectly blissful weekend morning.
The absolute hardest part is these first few days... my.oh.my - the headaches, the brain fog, the body aches - ugggghhh, I can't wait for day 4 or 5 to arrive so I feel somewhat human again! Part of the yucky feeling is quitting sugar and caffeine cold turkey, the other is the toxins coming loose through the cleanse.
The rest of the time I have had some chores to take care of.

Meanwhile, Mon Gateau is going to race. Leon has the mount. The race goes off and soon Leon is trapped in traffic in mid pack. He urges the horse on and gets the surge he wants. Down in the stretch, Mon Gateau looks good, only in a single bad step he bores in edging too close to the horse to his left which has to pull up for a second. Leon hand rides Mon Gateau in for a big win. The Foray guys won all sorts of bets, straight wins, trifectas, exactas, and even some daily doubles. Or did they?
Islam affirmed the spiritual equality of women and men. “Whoever does right, whether male or female,” states the Quran, “and is a believer, all such will enter the Garden.” Women therefore won greater protection under the law. The Quran prohibited the killing of daughters. Inheritance laws guaranteed a women a share of her parent’s or husbands’ property. Muslim women had to consent freely to marriage and had the right to an education. In the early days of Islam , some Arab women participated actively in public life.

Foam Soap is one way of getting better value; trials suggest that spray goes up to 3 times further than the liquid equivalent and costs about the same to produce. Not only can the usage be cut but there are some amazing savings to be had by choosing the right brand I am aware of a trail at well know airport where cost were reduced by a staggering 60%.
Before she gave me the recipe, I convinced Toby to take me to Stanford Center so I could try Sprinkles for the first time. Some of you may know Candace from Food Network’s Cupcake Wars, it her cupcakery that she started. Long story short, it was such a disappointment. Super dry and sugary with barely any flavor. The wooden spoon sucked because it just sucked moisture out of everything which made it even more dry. It was so much hype for the cost. I would definitely just try out this recipe, you won’t be disappointed!

We are worse off. Although it is four years since the worst of the 2008 recession, the UK economy has not yet regained the position that it had before the recession, and it may still be 1.8%-2.8% below 2008. Compared to the trend of the previous five years, the economy now is 12.5% smaller that it 'should have been' which explains why so many things are going wrong in public finances and consumer spending.
After she left, I pull it together and researched local REs. I have yet to melt down. I suppose I'll feel it most when AF comes to prove the emptiness of my womb. As much as this is sad, I have to have a plan. I will have a family. And I will not waste time getting there. I made 2 appointments with local REs in the next two weeks to get 'second opinions'. I also made a follow up with my current RE. And finally, I called CC.RM to set up a phone consultation with 'the' Dr. School.craft of CC.RM. I hope someone will have some ideas on how to help me reach my goal faster.

When Michael told me that he told Kevin it’s time, my stomach knotted up a bit. I’m serious! This is my first baby. His first steps, first day of school, first time riding a bike sans training wheels all seem like yesterday – and those were bittersweet for me. Now all signs point to the fact that he is, indeed, on the brink of manhood, and there is no going back – no turning back the clock and putting him in little footie pajamas, no snuggling him on my lap for The Runaway Bunny, no reaching out for him to hold my hand as we cross a street or parking lot. Time marches on, and babies grow up and become men and women.

Cosmas told me that Church Agricultural Projects, while it was a step forward, was still very much of a capitalist venture. The people who owned cattle were encouraged to pool them in the venture, but it was more like investment in share capital, because the people who contributed cattle were very often families whose men were working in the town so the actual work on the farm was done by people who were paid wages to do it.

This is a bad film. This doesn't begin to do justice to the names Dracula nor Frankenstein. I found myself looking away in embarrassment every time Dracula's echo chamber voice came on. Every major death in this film, while trying to look ironic and stylized, looks as if it were being slowly re-enacted by the Never Going To Be Ready For Prime Time Players. In short, this is one of those films that SHOULD have been made in 1985 - badness is expected then.

To serve, warm your plates and put your lemon pickle (or lemon wedge if you are going for the easier option) and tartare sauce in their dishes on the plate ready. Heat the frying oil. Heat the mashy peas over a low heat with a little veg stock to loosen if necessary. Keep an eye on it while you fry off the Halloumi. Drain the halloumi on kitchen paper and pile them on the plates with a big spoon (or quinelle) of the mashy peas.

My heart ached at the thought of leaving my loved ones, friends and such beauty, and even all the long term problems that I had had before the diagnosis, somehow now didn't seem all that bad! I just wanted to live! I ached for life.

If, as the gay community have embraced the word “queer”, and black rap stars have embraced the words once used to oppress them, I must embrace a word so long used to deride and intimidate me and mine, then so be it, is it not better to embrace a word than it is to be ruled by one?
I have hundreds (thousands!) of these little goodies hiding in my cupboards. I first started making them about 2 years ago. I remember that I gave some to my work colleagues before Christmas 2009 and one of my friends at work loved them so much that she started selling them to her colleagues. She sold over 100 (yes 100) in just 2 days. I was so surprised!

This last year I’ve experienced more pain than I have at any other point in my life. Some parts have been devastating, leaving me angry and hurt. I’ve often felt as if I’d been picked up in a whirlwind then dropped in the middle of nowhere, stunned, bruised, lost. I didn’t share that part of my life here for several reasons: If I didn’t put the circumstances “out there”, maybe it wasn’t really true; I am somewhat a private person and sharing the hurt made me uncomfortable; the pain I felt left me like a wounded animal who simply wanted to be left alone; and….I felt like a failure.

The nose is beautiful; full of rye spice with pickling herbs, very characteristic of a strong rye and very nice. The flavor is doesn't fully follow through with the nose. There is some good spice, but also a bit of soap and a watery quality which dulls the spice. I'd like to try this at a higher alcohol level, which might allow it to retain a bit of the punch from the nose. For now, I'll just enjoy the aromas.

I have never disliked Brussels sprouts the way some people do, but I can’t say they have ever been a favorite either. Andrea and I were at Trader Joe’s, saw these stalks of brussel sprouts and just had to bring them home to show the kids. We decided to fix them without telling the other how we would prepare them and then let you all know what we came up with. I did a little research and found a recipe with lots of good reviews. ( I have always sautéed Brussels sprouts in garlic and olive oil but wanted to try something different.) It sounded ridiculously easy so I decided to give it a try. I must say, they were better than I have ever tasted! Mae and Charlie were a little put off by the color at first but after a few bites they were won over as well.

There were several unique and interesting events going on in New York City, many of which were (much to my chagrin) already sold out. Fortunately, though, I found one open option that really piqued my curiosity: a street art photography workshop led by Saddleshoe Tours of the city’s Bowery, Lower East Side, and Soho neighborhoods. I brushed off my camera (still a touch gritty with dust from the Masai Mara and the Serengeti), charged the battery, deleted some of my older photos from the memory card, and headed out.

The street performer was lithely rolling a crystal (actually acrylic) sphere on his hands and body, set to pulsating music blaring from speakers attached to his iPod. He manipulated the ball with enigmatic fluidity; there were no breaks in the continuity of movement. The ball seemed to barely touch his skin, as if drawn by strings, as it gently rolled between his fingers, over his palms, and on his fingertips. At one point, the ball appeared to be suspended in mid-air, stationary, as he was writhing around it.

We've pretty much run out of its value when the 2004 bmw m3 csl is detected to lessen the bmw m3 csl of whiplash injuries. BMW continues to flesh out its offering with small cars, coupes, 4x4s and, now, executive hatchbacks with a smidgeon of sports utility vehicle thrown in for good measure. The 5 Series is ubiquitous on Britain's roads. However, most cars are as pleasant as the bmw m3 csl price among its rivals, though they've been running BMW close in recent years for dynamic prowess.

Like Truman’s own feelings, this is a film that is often contradictory and sometimes even incoherent, following an emotional trajectory along a seemingly logical path, though these two aspects come continuously into conflict. It might seem peculiar that we should be doing this through Truman’s eyes as he is an automatic outsiderm but this is in part to provide reassurance for the more conventional cinema patrons, providing a recognisable movie identification fogure and also trying to give the impression that this story is not directly about them. More craftily though it also serves to slightly wrong foot and confound viewer expectations because ultimately Truman finds himself conflicted about what to do. Confronted with a situation where simply applying the law won’t really stop a cycle of criminality that has its roots buried too deep, he has to look elsewhere for answers, none of them easy.
Shaun Paul's mum Carolanne, 40, warned local parents: "Please make sure your weans are safe. Don't let them out of your sight. If you do let them out, make sure they are with their friends. My boy survived, but we have a duty to speak up to warn others and make sure it doesn't happen to another wean. They might not be so lucky. I'm scared to let Shaun Paul out now in case they come back for him. I want people to know I'm not a racist - far from it. I have many Asian friends. But there is small minority of Asian youths who are terrorising the community and it has got to stop."
Hayman went on to have a row with Chairman Vaz, during which he said, “She’s impugnin’ my reputation, an’ I’m not ‘avin’ it”. Well, you can take the man out of Essex etc etc. In the meantime, several others in public life have impugned Andy’s reputation, and so I find it surprising that the gentleman in question is shocked by this. Rebekah Brooks too is shocked by those suggesting that she must have known at least something about Newscorp between 1999 and 2011, but we are rapidly learning how much notice to take of her astonishment. I expect Andy Hayman to face questioning of a rather more robust nature than he suffered yesterday. And I will be disappointed (although not surprised) if he manages to emerge from Hackgate in better condition than that in which he entered it.

Ben & Daníel are two composers used to shrugging off the distinction between experimental sound-art and deeply felt melodies. Frost’s vast, blackened post-industrial works often crystallize in moments of quiet beauty before disintegrating in pure visceral noise; Bjarnason’s orchestral music marries brutal modernism to classical aesthetics one moment and soaring ethereal harmonies the next. And yet here, on the tail of two widely acclaimed releases; Bjarnason’s PROCESSIONS (2010) and Frost’s BY THE THROAT (2009) we are given something altogether new. A unique collaboration, SÓLARIS is a quiet, stilled and all consuming symphonic suite at once as affecting and uncanny as the science- fiction classic that inspired it.

Give me the grace good Lord, to set the world at naught; to set my mind fast upon Thee and not to hang upon the blast of men’s mouths. To be content to be solitary. Not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind the business thereof. Not to long to hear of any worldly things, But that the hearing of worldly phantasies may be to me displeasant. Gladly to be thinking of God, Piteously to call for His help, To lean unto the comfort of God, Busily to labor to love Him. To know mine own vility and wretchedness, To humble and meeken myself under the mighty hand of God, To bewail my sins passed; For the purging of them, patiently to suffer adversity. Gladly to bear my purgatory here, To be joyful of tribulations, To walk the narrow way the leadeth to life. To bear the cross with Christ, To have the last thing–death–in remembrance, To have ever afore mine eye my death, that is ever at hand; To make death no stranger to me; To foresee and consider the everlasting fire of hell; To pray for pardon before the Judge come. To have continually in mind the passion that Christ suffered for me; For His benefits uncessantly to give Him thanks, To but the time again that I before have lost. To abstain from vain confabulations, To eschew light foolish mirth and gladness; Recreations not necessary, to cut off. Of worldly substance, friends, liberty, life and all–to set the loss at nought for the winning of Christ. To think my most enemies my best friends, For the brethren of Joseph could never have done him so much good with their love and favor as they did him with their malice and hatred.

What is most frustrating, however, is that if I could have told the person I was four years ago, who I would become four years from then, I would have laughed in my future face. It really takes a self realization (lightbulb) that you are in control of your own life and can make your own decisions. It also takes a development of courage to see that you can take the wrong fork in the road at certain points in your life, and can still make it to your final destination, even if its in a round-about way. Who knows, you may just stumble upon something better along the way.

Lets start by what you want to avoid. First of all you want to avoid anything too isolated. If you have to drive 15 minutes to buy a Coke then you probably have to drive 15 minutes or more to get immediate medical attention, and this is the kind of thing that you want to avoid. When you suffer a serious accident or stroke time is the key to your survival. I’m not saying live and die by this because people have to live wherever they are happier but from a strategic point of view its still worth considering. After 10-15 minute of the incident, your % of survival starts decreasing by the minute. The way I see it, being more than 15-20 minutes away from basic medical care , especially if you have kids, that’s the kind of risk I at least would not consider acceptable from a preparedness point of view.

Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord, a time-travelling, humanoid alien known as the Doctor who explores the universe in a sentient, telepathic time machine called the TARDIS that flies through time and space, whose exterior appears as a blue police box from London in 1963, when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, he faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help people and right wrongs.

Cooking is primarily instinct and experience; we know what our ingredients taste like and can usually match them well enough to work out a fine dish, using a little bit of this a little more of that, and so on until we find a delicious balance. But baking is more scientific; each of the ingredients serve a specific purpose that not only affects the flavor, but the texture, the size, and the shape. And then there is the issue of sugar, which is a pretty important part of baking sweets. Since I'm not much of a sugary sort of gal, I knew this would be one of my biggest challenges.

So in good conservative tradition, Bush did gave pride of place to the rights, liberties and dignity of the individual in defining what he stood for there (in speaking to a distinguished British audience at Whitehall Palace in London on November 19th, 2003). The full text of the speech here or here spells out that committment.
Jesus succeeded in securing all power by going to the cross, dying a horrible death, suffering the penalty for sin and defeating Satan in the pit of hell. He came to earth as a man for one reason: to recapture the authority Satan had stolen through Adam’s disobedience in the Garden. Jesus was called the last Adam

Maybe I would find a couple in the hotel bar that would invite me back to their room. They would both help me out of my clothes and the woman would get on her knees in front of me as she takes me into her mouth. The guy would finish undressing her and start playing with her tits and stroking his cock. She would take turns between my cock and her husbands. She would then lay back and spread her legs and allow me to enter her while she continued to suck her husbands cock. Then the couple would switch positions and he would take my cock in his mouth while the woman would straddle my face.
There's also an exciting development about future shows...

Mayan teacher Shonagh Home encourages us to do so one neighborhood at a time by eliminating dangerous chemicals and practicing organic living. We can make a cumulative difference and spread the word as we spiritually awaken. Protecting our earth is something England’s Prince Charles also champions in his extraordinary book “Harmony.” And, while I’m not a fan of royal hierarchy, I think this work is truly a gift. It’s spiritually minded, with a perspective on the environment that I find enlightening: “The dominant world view only accepts as fact what it sees in material terms. We have come to function with a one-sided, materialistic approach that is defined not by its inclusiveness, but by its dismissal of those things that cannot be measured in material terms. Our predominantly mechanistic way of looking at the world has excluded our spiritual relationship with Nature.” In essence, we have dismissed Nature. “Harmony” implores us to emulate Nature’s perfect and balanced cycles, so we can begin to restore the damage we’ve done to our earth, and to ourselves.

Do you remember SuperHOP IPA? That used to be Barley Creek's IPA, and it was...well, a beer with hops in. It's more than that now: SuperHOP is a "triple IPA," at 13.1%, and let me tell you, it hides it well. I'd have guessed 8% at most. It's bitter but not crushing, sweet but not sickening, and believe you me, it's warming.
Growing up in a small Northern Arizona town, Faith Cloudfoot’s life was spent playing in the forests surrounding her house under the protective eyes of her father, and learning about the legends of her Native American heritage. Yearning for more out of her life, she moves to Phoenix, Arizona at the age of twenty-three where she is kidnapped and almost killed.

When we arrived a guy named Daniel from Michigan (that's him and his tent in the picture above) was already there and we shared the fire and talked with him most of the evening. He was an interesting guy - traveling around and doing software development work with his laptop, he'd been all over the eastern U.S. since January and was getting ready to head back home to Michigan soon.
Since this is China, clothes are pretty easy. The ‘Zoo Market’ is opposite the animals. It’s also, in fact, a zoo: Five 7-storey buildings of factory-fresh flea market and plenty of shoving. Lacking stamina, I did one floor.

Seth looked at Midget. Midget shrugged his linebacker shoulders.
Vienna, on the other hand, is pure action, and though the film bears Johnny's name, it's really Vienna's movie — and Emma's. As Vienna finds herself caught up in the Dancing Kid's ill-advised plan to belatedly live up to his unearned reputation as an outlaw and robber, Emma stirs up the entire town into a fearsome but aimless lynch mob that's ostensibly searching for the bank robbers but is in fact, under Emma's direction, being aimed like a weapon towards the bitter woman's sexual rival. The entire mob, still dressed in black from a funeral, swarm on their horses through the bleak surroundings, spurred on by the black-cloaked Emma, who's like an avenging harpy with her teeth bared, snarling and insinuating, goading the men into terrible action, her face flushed with rage and vindictiveness. And when she gets her way she can't help but grin, the grin of the damned, an evil but joyous grin, girlishly skipping as she spurs on her followers towards death and destruction. Ray makes her a monster, a demon in black, her mourning shawl dropped from her head at the very beginning of the chase, the purpose — or the justification — for all this chaos almost immediately forgotten and replaced with a feverish sexual hysteria.
This holds true for promoters, would-be stage producers, and radio & TV researchers/producers. They, of course, have budgets, but…
We've been watching Bromley FC for about a decade now. We've always been fascinated by the characters off the pitch almost as much as those on it. It's a true community. As such you are able to observe at close hand the rich mix, the odd diversity. We often have nicknames for people before we get to know their real names. Some of them are long gone now, some appear again occasionally. Whatever happened to Strange Solitary Woman? We haven't seen Mr Hair for a while. Funny Bloke makes an appearance now and again, with his mate Henry VII. They refer to me as Northern Bloke, so it works both ways.
The tape was labeled years ago by me as “Polyrhythms,” and I hadn’t listened to it in quite a while. But as soon as I heard the first song on the B side, called “Green Face,” I knew exactly what I’d have for my playlist today. “Green Face” led off a bunch of tunes from another rare and hard-to-find progressive rock album, Eddie Jobson’s “Zinc” from 1983.
“That’s normal,” the veterinarian had warned. The steroids will makes him want to drink more and that will make him go more often. “Even if he hasn’t had one in years, he might start having accidents,” she said.

Please, Washingtonians, raise a ruckus. Now. Today. Call your representatives, write letters and emails. Let them know that in misinterpreting this act, the Washington Liquor Control Board has set the stage to kill jobs and crush local businesses under tax schemes that were never the intent of Initiative 1183.
The reality, however, is that since 2001 such unilateral captures by U.S. forces outside of “hot” battlefields, like Afghanistan, have been exceedingly rare. This is due in part to the fact that in many parts of the world our counterterrorism partners have been able to capture or kill dangerous individuals themselves.

I just wanted to credit you – I started running back in the day after reading your “maggot” posts. On 10/10/10 I ran the Chicago marathon. It’s all your fault ;) – BobbiI wanted to let you know what an inspiration you have been to me since I came across your blog in late 2007. I was never a runner and was one of those people who said, “oh, I CAN’T run.” Well, I am proud to say that I completed my first marathon last weekend! Thank you so much for all of your advice! I have referred so many people to your blog whenever they say “oh, I could never run like you are.” Thanks again! – SarahWhen you wrote your first few blog posts about how anybody can run, I was in a stressful job, a mom to one, and a wife to boot. I read the posts with interest but just really could not find the time. In all honesty I didn’t think I could possibly run. Slight jog maybe, fast walk more like it. I revisited your blog posts and read them a few times. I thought, “well, I’ll start off slow, embarrassingly slow, like Dr. M says.” And so it began. I have now run two 5k’s, completed my sprint tri, and I am signed up for a 6.66 mile Devil Run on Halloween. – Hdh500Four years later ... just want to say thanks. I’ve been working on “a new me” for the last 6 months or so; dropped a lot of weight, started exercising (mostly speed walking daily — about 5-6 miles/day) and really wanted to up the ante; tried running, but couldn’t do much more than 1/2 mile on a REALLY good day. I read your blog yesterday, and was able to run 2.5 miles yesterday following your advice to slow down. What a difference that made on my lungs! Thanks for the tips. I think you’ve made yet another convert. – EWI commented a couple times in the past year or two to thank you, but I just wanted to thank you again. Using your “go slow” technique I got to running three miles regularly. Then I had a sort of breakthrough and now I’m running 4.5 miles every other day, like clockwork. Today I ran five! And my time is even improving. I used to run 12-minute miles and now I’m closing in on 11. Thank you thank you thank you. Also, my biggest motivation? I’m sorry to be so shallow, but that photo of your abs on the beach. I’ve had two kids, it’s hard on the body, I’ve never had a lot of physical self-esteem anyway. Running makes me feel a lot better about my body. – Laurel.. and these are just some of the recent ones.
I'm going to tell E that his advice was good and it worked for us and then cross my fingers and hope he doesn't see the need to ask what we were talking about.
Make a small tofu assembly line – the first bowl will contain cornstarch, the second is the beer batter, the last Panko. Place a baking sheet or cutting board at the end to hold your little tofu bites. Dredge tofu squares in the cornstarch, knocking off any excess. With a fork, dip the tofu in the beer batter and cover completely, turning to get all sides. Knock off any extra batter. Dip into the Panko and coat completely. Place on baking sheet.

I need to get more positive here, i need to get more artistic, i mean, i enjoy writing the way i do, but sometimes, it spirals into a sort of depressive if not nihilistic tendency to think about all the shit that’s wrong with the world, so, i’m going to try and make a few bad jokes here. political, religious, cultural critiques in other words. I’m letting myself go off here, after writing it, i realised i’m only getting angry, but this is a positively angry post, and I hope there’s an end. I really don’t mean to hurt your feelings, but well, it’s what I call tough love. I only wish for people to think for yourselves, and if you really are offended by this post, just think about why you are upset, and make sure that you choose to believe what you believe, and let me believe what I believe, go ahead, feel sorry for me, get pissed off, whatever.
My advice is, come in at whatever level is convenient for you now, I trust my God that as He begins to bless you, you’ll keep on moving higher and there will be people who will enter in group two or three today before this time next year, they will already be in group ten.
I was soon back on the Red Arrow and back in Chesterfield. I had wanted to go to the Rose and Crown at Brampton but needed some cash and a loo visit first. I found the Market Inn on the Market Place which had been recommended to me earlier as selling local beers, but what I found was a range of national brews, with a few exceptions. I had a half of the Harviestoun Bitter and Twisted (£1.50) and stayed for a brief drink, given that it was completely rammed.
Obama grew up playing basketball, the sport invented in a YMCA in New Jersey. He attended Occidental College in Los Angeles, that all-American megalopolis in California, hoping to play basketball. But, like William J. Bennett who said he went to Williams College to play football but discovered he had a brain, Obama woke up to scholarship at Occidental — in a big way. He transferred to Columbia and graduated, worked building a powerful anti-poverty program from scratch in Chicago, and went off to law school at Harvard where he was a smashing success as a scholar and good guy.
If Burlew is your run of the mill exceptional geek. Okay, that sounds awkward, and wrong, but he is basically a geek at heart who has turned his passion into a living and has won many patrons. Then Amanda Palmer is loud, opinionated, in your face rocker woman of awesome! She is awesome because she is out there being herself and doing things that most people would write off because of fear. She actually was under a label for a while, and earned good press from the mainstream channels, and basically rocked it out! But then she decided that she didn’t want to be under a contract, or work for a label. She got out of that, and started to sell her music in pay what you think its worth fashion (NSFW), like Radiohead did. She has a huge online presence of over 50,000 twitter followers, and a very insightful highly read blog. Yesterday, she started her own Kickstarter Campaign to launch a new record, a book and a tour, asking for a pitiful sum of 100,000 thousand dollars, and 30 days to raise it. She broke the 100 grand mark in 11 hours. I have not listened to much of her music, although its easy to find her you-tube videos. That said, I love her energy, passion, and go get em tiger attitude that she practically flings off her online presence that you can’t help but get a little excited about life yourself. She is like an energizer bunny on crack, flying to the center of the universe while she sings. She is just buzz.
"It's a tremendous advantage," Ratner responded, though there are no results yet to speak of. "First, being in the New York general market is tremendous, whether it be media or advertising or sponsorhip or fans, or just the history of sports in this region. we're already seeing it, that there's a tremendous desire, in the NBA generally, to play in big markets and there's already a tremendous interest by players and fans alike."
I started at my house and ran to my gym where I did about 40 minutes of strength training and then I ran home. I'm so used to trying to cram runs into a limited amount of time that I had to keep reminding myself that I had all the time in the world. There was no reason I had to run fast. There was no reason I had to rush. Which I think is why my pace graph looks like an EKG. I'd catch myself speeding up and then try and slow down. Over and over again. Maybe some day I'll actually learn how to pace myself.
Whether you make it yourself, hire someone to make it, have a family member or a friend make it, get it from the thrift store, or buy it off the rack: make it mean something. Make it special. Even if you are having fun with it: Its a big deal.
