“This debate boils down to a simple choice. We can come together for the good of the country and reach a compromise or we can issue insults and demands and ultimatums at each other, withdraw to partisan corners, and achieve nothing. We know the right thing to do, and we know what the American people expect us to do.” — President Barack Obama in the July 23, 2011 Weekly Address

While the show gives nods to the original three commissioners -- and of course to John Randel, the surveyor tasked with outlining every foot of land -- it's the later applications of the grid plan that I found most fascinating. The book reprints images of country homes next to street plans that would shortly cut through the property. It's a melancholy display, I guess, the destruction of natural beauty has rarely been as fascinating.
I also had some extra black beans that I blended with a spoonful of sour cream, some jalapenos, salt and pepper, and some minced garlic. This was terrific drizzled over the dips, spooned onto a chip, or even served with a fresh quesadilla!
When I first began using an eye cream, I was using a concentrated eye cream by Shisedo. I was very happy with this eye cream at first. It was rich, felt very soothing going on, and was chock full of wrinkle fighting goodies! My eyes weren’t as puffy in the morning either, which was a plus! However, after using this cream for almost a year, I wasn’t seeing any long term results. I found out that this cream had mineral oil in it.

Where do you want to spend your emotional and creative resources? This isn’t a trick question and there isn’t one right answer. You have to do a cost/benefit analysis of how maintaining an online presence fits into the current stage of your writing career. If you are getting up at 4:30 every morning to write before work, then falling asleep at night sometimes before your kids do, then time is probably your most precious resource right now and best not to squander it. Better to spend your time learning the craft and pursuing your dream. But if your engine is set to high idle and you’re just raring to go, by all means, dive in and being putting some of that energy to work for you in building a social media presence. You can absolutely have a two-pronged approach to establishing your career!

There were parts of the movie I liked though too. I liked when Adam decides to run with his son in the father-son race. CAUTION--SPOILERS AHEAD: Another favorite part was when the construction worker kept his integrity even though it meant putting his much needed job on the line. I think the most touching scene though was when the father of the teenage daughter took her to a fancy restaurant and dressed up to let her know how much she meant to him and that he loved her so much that he wanted the best for her. He asked her to promise him that she would let him approve the guys she wanted to date and until they agreed on the right one, he gave her a ring to wear to memorialize their special dinner and agreement. I liked that the young guy who was a father out of wedlock and left the girl on her own decided to step up and be a father to his little girl.

One of the particular challenges of writing for children rather than adults (or even older teens) is that to get your book into the hands of the reader, you have first to get it past a gatekeeper. Your young readers may well want to read books with swearing, sex and violence in, but the gatekeepers don't want them to. The gatekeepers are teachers, librarians and parents. They are the ones who hold the purse strings, and they have to be satisfied that your book is 'suitable' for the little darlings in their care. Needless to say, their idea of 'suitable' rarely matches the readers' idea of 'desirable' and often doesn't match the writer's idea of 'realistic'.
However, until that time comes, we will relish in the subtle light of candles, which create that enchanting atmosphere, so significant of the winter season.
parochial grade school principal by the name of Mr. Weber and he kept a rubber hose in the desk for the eighth grade boys. About fifteen years back an auto mechanic left a length of black brake hose in the car after he finished putting in new brakes. That eighteen inch of pliable rubber hose is now called Mr. Weber and gets used often. We found it very quiet and with young children that was great; also terrific sting and nice thin parallel purple tram lines. Highly recommended! You can name yours for whomever you like . . . .

I was super excited to get to team up with FunBites and try their Luv It Funbites. As I said before, my girls "LUV IT"! They actually eat more and have FUN while doing it. I notice they like to play with the shapes and make neat little designs before eating it. I find this product both FUN and educational, by simply letting children use their imagination to make pictures with the shapes and then get to eat their art work! I found it to work well, and would recommend FunBites!

I feel like it’s almost a taboo thing with all school-free learners, including unschoolers, to talk about being lonely or not fitting in. Such a common criticism from outsiders is school-free learners won’t be “socialized,” and will instead be forever “socially awkward” and “unable to interact with others.” So we get used to touting the party line that unschoolers have tons of friends, do tons of activities, never have any trouble interacting with anyone, ever, etc.

It is a very special moment for us with 59 students of the Class of 2012 graduating today.

I would like to highlight some of the achievements of the last academic year.
In Changes, not only does Harry find out that he has a daughter that he never knew about, but he also finds out that she’s about to be used as a human sacrifice. And the main action takes place in Mexico, not Chicago. Pretty much every significant character Harry has encountered throughout the series makes an appearance, but those relationships don’t necessarily remain the way we’d expect. With Ghost Story, I will be caught up with that series, so I’m drawing it out a little. But I won’t be able to wait for long!

"I should note that even though I felt stage-managed by Conroy's heavy hand, I still turned the pages with relish. Conroy is an immensely gifted stylist, and there are passages in the novel that are lush and beautiful and precise. No one can describe a tide or a sunset with his lyricism and exactitude."Conroy makes the city of Charleston come to life, and he describes the terror of experiencing a hurricane. At times, he gets close to describing what it's like to have friends for life. Too bad I didn't like or believe in half of the characters.

When you feel the burn at the back of your neck and behind the ears, a throb at the temple, head heavy as boulder , eyes nothing but overflowing pools of hot liquid. When your cheeks, and jaw hurt as if you have chewed on something hard for a long time. When “moving on” seems like biggest hoax. What doesn’t kill you doesn’t make you stronger , it cripples you. It is intensity of the disaster that matters. The deluge of grief that opens up so many wounds. It makes distances grow manifold.

Frost the whole cake with a thin layer of white frosting. This is called a crumb layer. It helps to keep the crumbs out of the final layers. After this layer is complete, put your cake in the fridge for about 20 minutes to let the frosting set. Then frost the remaining cake (except the hat area) with the peach color frosting. Now it is time to add the details to make this cake come alive.

However, supply is falling. Up until the 1960s, mankind dealt with increased food demand by increasing farmland. However, starting in the ‘60s we began trying to meet demand by increasing yield via fertilizers, irrigation, and better seed. It worked for a while (McLoran notes that between 1975 and 1986 yields for wheat and rice rose 32% and 51% respectively).

The Vintage Graph for this wine shows a straight line across with all the flavors being intense. What I intended by that is that the flavors are discernible. You don’t have to go hunting around for the “tea leaf” or “fig” or “espresso”. They are right there.

Dear Mr. Keller:
A spiritually-minded person will never come to you with the demand—”Believe this and that”; a spiritually-minded person will demand that you align your life with the standards of Jesus. We are not asked to believe the Bible, but to believe the One whom the Bible reveals (see John 5:39-40). We are called to present liberty for the conscience of others, not to bring them liberty for their thoughts and opinions. And if we ourselves are free with the liberty of Christ, others will be brought into that same liberty— the liberty that comes from realizing the absolute control and authority of Jesus Christ.
Now I only recall my friend crying one time before and that was because of a death in the family, but let me tell you he cried tears of laughter that August morning.

I do not champion the life of the childless or dislike children. The negatives of being childless become greater as individuals age. Parents pass away and often, only siblings, if there are any, remain as the only close family. Even a minimal level of care taking or assistance becomes unavailable. Holidays can become times of sadness. Many are terrified at the prospect of aging alone - even with money, a social safety net needs to include people, something money doesn't buy.
So, they can't find the cockup in my size and call upstairs to see if the orthepedist will give me his cockup. Nope - he didn't have the right size either so they decided to custom make a wrist splint for me - which ended up being a partial cast. They CASTED my wrist.
Christ calls us to something higher. He said that the second greatest commandment was to love you neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:39). I think we would all agree that we love ourselves, but how many of us could come up with even one other person that we love as much as ourselves? How many of us can say that we tolerate the faults in others as much as our own? (Luke 6:41) That seems to be asking a lot.

I often wonder if there is only a certain amount of luck in the world. I do believe there are different types of luck. One type is the old 'the more I practice the luckier I get' type, which is the only luck you can control. Then there's the 'OMG, look, someone's dropped a walletful of CASH. Dinner's on me!' which is the right place at the right time sort of luck. Then there's 'the stars aligning, the sheer forces of the cosmos coming to your aid ably assisted by quite a few battalions of archangels' type of luck. Basically the sort of luck which, in an ordered universe, really shouldn't be allowed.

It will be interesting to see how this film plays to French audiences. Paris movie-goers are famous cinephiles, so there's little doubt it will be lapped up for its many cinematic virtues. The French are also unusually interested in the plight of Australia's Aborigines. Many is the time I have been quizzed by locals interested in the Aboriginal story. If the French media dedicate any air time or column space at all to Australia, it is more often than not to explore the Aboriginal predicament. Samson & Delilah will doubtless go some way to feeding that fascination.

My most significant issue is tied to Nada himself, or perhaps an improvising Piper. Initially, he professes to believe in the American way; patience and effort will be rewarded. However, he then responds to his discovery by, essentially, going on a killing spree. I was able to find some motivation for his behaviour with the brutal police invasion but, if this incident was the catalyst, we’d hardly know it from his poker-faced reaction.
And both Forest City and BUILD--the latter an organization created to negotiate the CBA, with no previous track record in job training--tried to deflect the issue by citing other evidence regarding project jobs and job assistance.

I wanted some peace and quiet in the cool, polluted night air, so I put as much distance between us and the geezer as quickly as possible. The Fledgling Sparrow immediately began to give me crap for not helping the gimpy geezer, as I am always telling her to be a good person, help others, and so on. That's the kind of shit you tell kids. But my daughter is finally reaching the age where I can begin telling her about some of the ugly truths in life, geezers being one of them, so I told her the story of The Cautionary Tale of The Old Bat. It was an appropriate time to tell the story, as it was a dark and spooky night, as are most nights in our ghetto; a good time for a ghost story.

Then there was the racing certainty that it would annoy all the other acts, promoters and venues which had paid for and put up the posters.

The songs jump back and forth between being extremely catchy and excruciatingly satirical. Sometimes it’s hard to tell whether the point of the song is comedy or if it’s being serious. Hilton seemingly plays the role she was born for (a stuck up party girl with a bunch of money), but her acting chops are lacking even if her performances are well done. There are a lot of interesting cinematic ideas being thrown around by Bousman (enough to inspire a big budget action film in 2010) but not everything seems to land.
The person who came up with the idea of recording chiptune covers of Daft Punk is an indisputable genius. The second compilation from the online collective that formed to do just that features artists such as Sabrepulse, RushJet1, and Knife City trying their hand at eight-bit renditions of the French house duo’s hits. The artists all do an impressive job of employing the glitchy bass drones and frenetic blips and bloops of retro electronics to perfectly capture the legendary electronic duo’s sound, retaining the epic scope and scale of songs ranging from Daft Punk’s studio albums to the Tron: Legacy soundtrack with sounds that ordinarily sound inherently small.
As it grew closer, Alice saw that it was the figure of a man, or was it a man? It seemed to be of human form, and male, but young, only a few years older than she was in fact. As he approached Alice realised, with a shock greater than any other she had encountered yet, why he was familiar.
I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to believe that the pictures are real not realizing it’s just a distraction and a tool to keep me preoccupied by triggering within me reactions as feeling and emotions where within that I cover myself with more energetically created layers of distraction as comparisons/desires/jealousy/wants/needs towards the pictures that I see and from here seeing the reality is even more difficult
I am not stating that politicians are evil. But I am advocating for us. Speak up and complain to the political offices and your local headquarters. Complain when you hear unfavorable ads about the other candidate. We are American’s and we should stand as ONE; not just political affiliations. We must call these political offices and let know how we feel about their negative ads. We, as American’s, deserve more for ourselves and must demand more of our candidates.
As a quadriplegic, Christopher Reeve accomplished more than most people can with the use of all their limbs. He even helped fund the American Paraylsis Foundation that is now aptly named the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. He never stopped working to improve his and others' situation, and he never stopped believing he would one day walk again. (Something that his doctor's claimed impossible for an injury as severe as his. After all, he couldn't even breathe without help!)

I hate working out, and, as I just said, I am not nor do I have a desire to be an athlete. But I cannot fully describe the joy that Taekwondo brought to my life. I have noted before, at least to Anthony, that I notice a significant difference in my happiness when I have TKD in my life, versus when I don’t. Yesterday I was feeling utterly shitty, walked home, grabbed workout clothes, walked all the way back to work and practiced my forms, and I felt better.
The mother of a 14 year old boy said, “come-on pimpin” to her 14 year old boy? When you become a teacher, you quickly learn that often the way that students behave is a reflection of their home, and if that’s the case can I really be surprised at the way he behaves if his own mother is calling him a pimp? How can we expect this adolescent to grow up and respect women and treat them well if he, at 14, already has it in his head that it is okay to smack a young lady on her behind, in school no less? How can we expect him to grow up and remain faithful to his girlfriend/wife, if he already keeps a starting line up and a 6th girl on the bench? How can we expect to not create a new generation of black men that are so often referred to as “niggas who aint shit” when we show our young men that it’s okay and cool to be called things such as pimp/player/mack. While we are raising young men to be disrespectful to women, we are the same women who profess vehemently that there are no good black men left. Why are we subjecting our little girls to such a dreary future full of men that we have let perpetuate these negative stereotypes?

That said then I do believe it needed for the societies to offer the opportunity for people of any faith, to live according to that faith, as far as they participate and accept the laws of the country. We have an expression in the Talmud, Dina Malchuta Dina, the law of the land is the law (Bava Kama 113a, Bava Batra 54b-55a et.al. The extent of the principle is discussed among the Rishonim (the medieval rabbis), some stating that it is only related to financial matters, where others state that it is in general where the law doesn’t go against the Torah), at least so far as it doesn’t force people to go against the Torah. For example, should ritual slaughter be prohibited in Denmark, it wouldn’t mean that the Jews in Denmark would have to eat unkosher meat, though it would make it hard for them to find and achieve kosher meat.

When your ribs are done and resting, fry a half pound of diced bacon over medium heat until the bacon is beginning to brown. Add 2 medium thinly sliced onions and stir often while the onions brown. Pour off pooled up excess bacon grease once they are done. You need it a little greasy to fry the kraut, but too much grease will make the dish too rich. Add a large bag of drained sauerkraut and stir it all together until the kraut begins to dry and brown slightly in areas. You may want to turn your heat up a couple notches for this step. You probably won't need salt but I recommend lots of pepper. I also like a little extra spice to most everything I eat, so I add a couple pinches of red pepper flakes to my sauerkraut in the final minute of cooking.

According to his most recent office manager, Justin Meccia, John Corapi returned from a hunting trip in September and gave notice to Justin and other Santa Cruz Media staff that he was closing his business.
The epigram with which I began is the epigram to Thomas Bernhard's novel The Loser (Der Untergeher, literally the undergoer) and refers to the suicide of Wertheimer, a failed pianist who, after hearing of the natural death of Glenn Gould, his friend, his piano hero and the one who dubbed him a loser, hangs himself, thereby prompting the narrator, their mutual friend who had renounced his own piano career in face of Gould's virtuosity, to abandon his work About Glenn Gould to write instead about Wertheimer: "I only had two people in my life who gave it any meaning: Glenn and Wertheimer. Now Glenn and Wertheimer are dead and I have to come to terms with this fact." We are reading that coming to terms.

But as we slowly, slowly made our way up through heavy rain and ridiculous traffic to the Stoudt's Fest, arriving an hour before it ended (MJ made a quick tour of the floor, and then locked himself in Carol's office with a bottle of Triple), I realized that he was right. The rug didn't fit on the wide expanse of blonde wood floor. Except it was a touch of softness in an open space, something interesting. Whether he ever wrote about it or not (and I never saw anything about it), it was a memory key, a small something that would bring back the whole feel of the place. I learned that trick, and use it myself.

To date, the Modern Slave Guide has focused on the workings of the slave machine; from now on, this focus is shifting to a near future narrative in which the machine, as such, no longer exists. I don’t endorse “truths” or predict futures, and have little use for consensus reality or common knowledge. My thang is the narrative, because narrative is intent, and intent creates reality. To build something, you must first intend it in your mind.

Because of the show schedule and the cold weather that set in, I don’t have many other photos either. Hopefully, I’ll have an opportunity to take more when we go back this week. You can always
This is Albany, Western Australia. It’s a town where we used to camp fairly regularly as kids, in a tent in a caravan park near the beach. I remember it being a stinking long drive but when we did arrive we loved it. I remember icecreams, beach sand, fishing, cold winds and swelteringly hot days.

Despite all that the media can do to maintain the fiction, the public is catching on to the climate change hoax. Every year, NOAA predicts a "more active than usual" hurricane season, and every year they are proven wrong. Come to think of it, how can it be that every year is "more active than usual"?
Next to olive oil, Avocado is the second fruit with the highest content (20%) of "oleic acid", a monounsaturated fatty acid that may help lower (LDL) cholesterol.

Let's start with some of Sean words:
Sheri Hamilton strolled out of the Sanford Building oblivious to the fact that I was sitting in the iron bench beside the walkway. She was wearing the loose purple sundress that to my eyes had a habit of seductively clinging to her beautiful athletic body. Throw in how the late morning sun was reflecting off her blond hair and my over active hormones were screaming at me to pull her off into some quite and secluded corner of the campus. Instead, I limited myself just to sneaking up behind her and grabbing her butt to cop a quick feel.

Brendon has had a taste of the Mentawais, and he’s been itching to spend more time in Indo. So, after a series of unfortunate events – coupled with the perfect timing of a down economy – we decided that after all was said and done, time is more valuable than any material wealth. So, we put our rose-colored glasses on and decided to stretch our dollar in Bali…and here we are.

Heat up some olive oil and/or butter in a pot, enough to cook up the onions. Cook the onions over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Add the white wine, the diced preserved lemon, and the fish. You can salt and pepper the fish before adding it to the pot, but the overall result was a tiny, tiny bit salty for me because of the preserved lemons. (And I have a habit of purposely under-salting when I cook for myself.) Next time, I think I will just pepper the fish.

In the end, our carrots were well traveled - by truck from the farm field to produce sheds, the CS plant, distribution centers and grocery stores and by car to your home. The price of gas has to affect the cost of the soup. CS plants then must use technology and efficiency to keep the cost of their soup lower. This translates into more business and eventually, more jobs.

Miranda (the high schooler - 14) is a very witty and intelligent girl. She's got the most contagious laugh and she's gorgeous .... thankfully, she isn't quite aware of that though. LOL She is ADHD, so she tends to be quite a challenge as well. She does take medication to help her maintain and stay focused during the day. Unfortunately, after 8 years of taking that medication, she still can't remember to take them on a daily basis without being reminded. Being the oldest child, I expect more of her than she's willing to give.

Saturday Night Live
listening to the little choruses wake,
This battle has produced questions by the thousands. “When will we know the results?” “What are the side effects?” “Is this normal in chemo treatments?” “Should we be concerned?” “What is the success rate?” And on and on… But there’s been one question that has been ever-present in our hearts and minds. “Why do these things happen and what are the outcomes of us going through this?” Honestly, I never directly asked the question. I made a conscious effort to omit it from my prayers. Sometimes it was because I was afraid of what the answer would be. Other times it was because I felt it led down a path of distraction and frustration. I prayed, instead, hoping some good would come out of the battle we were fighting. But to say that it was not in my heart and mind would be simply false. Of course we wanted to know “Why us?” Of course we wanted to know why we were fighting this fight; that's human nature. I think now, especially at the end of Levi’s treatments, we are even more prone to looking back and asking “Why did we just go through that?”

The king of Sodom said to Abram, 'Give me the people, and you can take the livestock.' But Abram replied, 'I lift my hand and swear by the L-rd, G-d Most High, Creator of the heavens and the earth: not a thread or a sandal-thong shall I accept of anything that is yours. You will never say, "I made Abram rich." I shall accept nothing but what the young men have eaten and the share of the men with me, Aner, Eschol, and Mamre; they must have their share.'
The ebook only package, like the other packages, is overpriced at £495. Elm also declares with this service, ‘- NO ANNUAL FEE EVER!’ This is a case of the author really getting nothing for nothing.

In the meantime, if I could fashion a “Welcome” sign that is legible to Swallowtails and plunk it in the ground adjacent to the parsley, I would.
So don’t just quit because something is difficult. Life is always going to have a good mix of tough days alongside the easy ones. But if your heart isn’t in it, don’t settle. Life is too special. Even more than that, your life is too special not to live in a way that honours the needs of your spirit.

Odd size logos, etc can be cut smaller and several can be used to create a design that is the size of the other shirts. It is like making a collage–combine the designs to make a pleasing picture. The usual size of the template may be: 12×12 inches, 10×10 inches, 16×16 inches, 14×14 inches, or 18×18 inches. These will vary with the logo sizes on the shirts. For a crib size shirt using baby clothes the template may be 3×4 or 3×5 inches using 12-15 toddler to infant size tshirts. A twin size using toddler and small child size shirts 40-54 shirts and a 5×8 or 6×9 template.

After he died I was emotionally incapable of leaving the home that we had built here.

The other night my daughter saw me getting ready for school and seemed a little upset crying when I did my hair and makeup because she knew. She new I would be leaving her and tonight was a 'daddy tucks me in only night'. As I bent down to give her a kiss goodbye she started crying so hard. I knew she loved me and I my heart ached that she did not want me to go. My initial reaction was to stay and skip class, then I thought of her future. If I did not go, I would be hurting my career as a student. I remembered that I am doing this for her. I am getting my education for her, so she and her sister can have a better future filled with after school activities, family vacations, college, a wedding. I am going to school so I can provide a better future for her and my family. Once I remembered that these tears are only temporary and she wont even remember this in a few years, I bent down and spoke to her. I told her what I was doing, and who this was for. I explained that she probably wont understand a word I just said as she will be 2 in only a few days. I gave her a big bear hug, attempted to kiss her again and left. My heart did still ache as I heard her cry once more, but I knew what I needed to do.
Evenly spread the onions on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Gently press the ground beef on top of the onion flakes. Press evenly making one giant patty. Sprinkle with seasoned salt. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Using a paper towel, pat the excess grease from the top of the patty. Top with cheddar cheese, return to oven for 2 more minutes. Remove from oven, let set 5 minutes then cut into 24 patties. Slice open and separate each party roll. Place bottom of rolls on a large platter. Using a spatula lift patty with onion layer onto each bun bottom. Top each slider with a pickle slice then the bun lid. Serve immediately.

In a way, these critics are right: writing is easy. At least it is if you are content to produce mediocre writing. After all, you only need to type a bunch of words that go together, right? All you have to do is think up some characters and have them interact with each other in a story, right?

To the extent that the regular army comes into violent conflict with either side, it is overwhelmingly likely that it will be with the Muslims, who will probably take to the streets to confront the army quite quickly, rioting, burning, and, as the conflict progresses, shooting and bombing as well when they can. Given the opinions that those in the British Army are likely to have of Muslims in general, and given the violence and hostility they are certain to experience from Muslims, they are unlikely to interact smoothly with them even in the absence of violence. Irrespective of the multicultural guff that senior figures in the army will undoubtedly be spouting, the sympathies of the troops and junior officers will, of course, lie entirely with their own people, and their hatred of Muslims will grow by the day.

I recently read this article in the NY Times which inspired me to pick up a jar of coconut oil at Whole Foods. Like many of you, I had previously associated coconut oil with high calories, trans fats, and the whole movie-theater-popcorn-popped-with-coconut-oil-is-worse-for-you-than-six-Big-Macs scandal of the 1990s. But, as the article states, many scientist are now backtracking and re-evaluating coconut oil, now focusing on virgin, expeller-pressed coconut oil, instead of the hydrogenated stuff that they used to pop that movie theater popcorn.
Many multinationals have these capabilities, but unless they have been operating in China for some years, they may well lack the domestic-market knowledge or relationships needed to apply them effectively. The solution—building a true domestic Chinese presence rather than an outpost—sounds obvious, but it’s difficult to carry out without commitment from the top. Too many companies fail by using “fly over” management. But some multinationals appear to be investing the necessary resources; for example, we recently met (separately) with top executives of two big industrial companies who were being transferred from the West to run global R&D organizations from Shanghai. The idea is to be closer to Chinese customers and the network of institutions and universities from which multinationals source talent.
Peace. Be still.
Everything went along pretty normal, and I went straight home. Don’t think that after this you can go on ahead to a lively evening of fun, or even of just being out. Again, everyone is different, but I get very tired and need to rest for the rest of the night. What was different for me this time was that I really got sick. I can’t say I was dizzy, but I was nauseous and had a headache to the point that I thought I was going to toss whatever cookies I had in me, but didn’t. This persisted on into the next day (yesterday) and again, this morning still had a slight headache, but a cup of coffee fixed that right up. Now, I don’t want this to discourage anyone from donating component blood, but I felt I should document it here because I really think that it’s due to the possibility I didn’t eat well enough before my donation. Like I said before, I’ve not been eating a lot of red meat lately and for lunch, the meal right before my donation, I just had chicken soup and soy nougats that are supposed to have a lot of protein in them. So, I don’t know. Afterwards, I was so nauseous that I couldn’t bring myself to eat anything. So maybe this should be the “CAUTION” paragraph. Please make sure that you prepare yourself properly before a donation of platelets, or any component blood. For whole blood they just tell you to drink a lot, and that’s important for platelets, too; but maybe because this procedure is much more involved that we need to be aware of and do more for ourselves, and for our own good. Don’t act tough. Don’t act stupid. Taking care of yourself is cool. Taking care of yourself is the most important thing you could do.
But that freedom comes with a price. And one facet of that price is that the individual citizen would have to participate, to man and woman up, to not delegate their responsibilities to unknown, faceless others. In a world in which even an invalid grandmother can spot targets out her farmhouse window and call for fire, the typical sandal-wearing 911-dialing man-mouse would become an endangered species. And civilization would thus lurch forward for the better as it crunches over the bones of those who gladly trade liberty for insecurity. Including those bones of those nobly misguided patriots who fear the prospect of local or regional warlords (read as “militia leaders”) so much that they eagerly not only accept, but actively promote, the yoke of the greatest warlord class in history in exchange for protection from those lesser shadows.

I don't want to draw lines in the sand and tell Him, you can not ask me to cross this line, I am at my limit. I don't even know my limit. I don't even know my own heart. I don't even know myself.
But, godliness is not just the individual Jesus Christ, but the corporate Christ. We can say that Jesus was revealed in the flesh, He was vindicated in the Spirit, He was seen by angels, and He was taken up in glory. But, we cannot say that He was proclaimed among the nations, nor was He believed on in the world.

Somehow Russell made it back to his apartment. He thought he and Carlos shared a cab, but wasn’t sure. Everything after they left the Hustler Club was a blur. Had all of this been a dream? It felt totally surreal. He knew Stock Photo Woman would hit the ceiling and worry herself to death over him, if he told her about any of this. He sensed that she wouldn’t listen to this mind control angle, convinced as she is that her father raped her. He is a monster, and that is that! His head hurt like hell. He gulped down some tylenol, and decided, ‘I will read about Project Bluebird now, and be done with it!’ He was very undecided about contacting her father again. If it was her father. He wasn’t sure of anything anymore.
So this year I decided to mix things up a bit. I found a wonderful color palette blog called Design Seeds. Jessica Colaluca is the brains behind that operation that takes a fresh look at color and supplies creatives like me with beautifully rendered palettes. Miss Jessica was kind enough to let us play along with her palettes as long as we linked back to her site. So I asked the participants to choose one color from a group of twelve. This could be a complete challenge to them, or something that they loved. Either way, I sent a totally unique palette to all 54 players in this colorful game. The only rule was that they had to use the main color that they chose. At the end of this post you will find a complete list of all the hoppers. I hope you will visit each one and of course, leave some feedback for them to let them know what you think of their interpretations!
So, here’s the thing: I decided I wanted to be a writer, like a proper full-on all-the-time story-type person, when I was 11. Weird. What’s weirder though is that I’m now actually doing it. The dream I had as to what I might do with my life is actually coming kind of true. It messes with your mind, that kind of stuff!
On the other side of that coin, he is all BOY. He likes burps and farts, getting dirty outside and riding his bike. He loves wrestling and watching baseball. Ben’s all time fave thing to do is play his X-Box. He has been playing this since he was old enough to sit on his father’s lap and watch. I’m not sure whether that’s a good thing or not, but he is mega great at games at this point. In fact, when he grows up he wants to either be a Major League baseball player OR a game tester! He likes playing rough so sometimes momma has to step aside and leave the rough handling to the big guy. (hubby) OR….sometimes he takes it out on his sister. See below:
I spent about an hour recently on one of my favorites, and managed to clear my list of a birthday gift for my 10-year old niece; an anniversary gift for my sister and brother-in-law; flowers for my "adopted mom" who recently underwent knee-replacement surgery; and a congratulations basket for a dear friend who recently had twins!
I know some things now though. I know I was meant to be their Mama. They chose me, they chose to come to me and Tim because they are our People and we need them. We need them like air, like manna, like beer.
The simple answer is that all believers have a ministry to perform. 2 Corinthians5:18shows us that we have been reconciled to God by Jesus Christ and have been given the ministry of reconciliation. Then in verse 20 it says, “We are ambassadors for Christ.” We are here on earth to fulfil His ministry of grace.
If mothers could have a lesson or two or three in nutrition it would save the family illness, depression lack of self-esteem, and humiliation. Eating well doesn’t always mean having to eat organics or expensive foods. People can eat simple and for less money, understanding nutrition is the key to health, saving money, illness and heartache all the way around.
In last week’s reading, he pointed out that Christians would know each other by their righteousness and warned them that the world would hate them because of their goodness. He cited Cain as an example of someone who hated his brother’s righteousness so much that he slayed him.

Later in the afternoon, a first year student at Colorado College said, “It’s been amazing to me to see how much we aren’t told about history in public school. Unless someone tells you, you never really have the chance to realize that most of the people involved would have different stories than what shows up in mainstream American text books – and that a huge number of important events are just left out.”

For example, I am the mother who cares for Naika, but I did not birth her!!! I get this. She is mine through adoption, and God formed her in her mother’s womb. She carries the genes of her birth mom and birth dad (who we may never know). It is truth. I embrace it. I can be her mom in all ways possible, except in a birth mom sort of way.
For the record..I always knew God was a merciful God. It's just at this moment in time, I see His mercy in my life and not just others. :)

It is important to know that within this mystery the truth is literally spoken to us. We just have to listen closely. We're given hints to the "Island" being a place where if you can imagine certain things then they can manifest into that "space". We're told many times over to pay attention to the metaphor of the story.

Kings – Kings was the best new drama of the year, but of course it had the unfortunate distinction of being on NBC – the elephant’s graveyard of television. Starring Ian McShane and Chris Egan Kings was a sprawling epic that told a modern day version of King David. It was classy, well acted and gave us a whole new world to explore – of course NBC was going to cancel it. It’s what they do.

As an illustration of how the funded experts preempt space in the media, table I-4 describes the “experts” on terrorism and defense issues who appeared on the “McNeil-Lehrer News Hour” in the course of a year in the mid-I980s. We can see that, excluding journalists, a majority of the participants (54 percent) were present or former government officials, and that the next highest category (I5.7 percent) was drawn from conservative think tanks. The largest number of appearances in the latter category was supplied by the Georgetown Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), an organization funded by conservative foundations and corporations, and providing a revolving door between the State Department and CIA and a nominally private organization. On such issues as terrorism and the Bulgarian Connection, the CSIS has occupied space in the media that otherwise might have been filled by independent voices.

I had him go through it to decide what he wanted to keep, and what he wanted to get rid of. I did the same thing with my side of the closet.

Through the memory-banks of universal myth and legend which store much of our species prehistoric records Hancock uncovers traces of a precise scientific language, encoding the results of thousands of years of accurate astronomical observations. He studies ancient maps, incorporating spherical trigonometry, showing how the earth would have looked 12,000 years ago and with levels of accuracy not achieved by our own cartographers until the nineteenth century. Finally, he uses the most up-to-date techniques of geology and astronomy to show that the conventionally accepted dating of a number of intriguing archaeological sites around the world cannot possibly be correct and that they must be considered far, far older than was previously thought.

And it isn't just the food groups he's particular about. Oh no. Let us not forget the grouping of the food on the plate. The potato mustn't touch the stew, beans on the left, fish fingers on the right etc. The ketchup (compulsory with all meals apart from the bowl of cereal in the morning and I fear it is only a matter of days before he demands it there too) has to be pooled neatly in the exact spot on the plate he indicates or all hell breaks loose. I swear a mad dictator could not be more demanding or persnickety. In a bid to allow him some sense of self - going on the premise that this flip in his behaviour is a developmental stage - please, please let it be so - I'm going along with some of this. Plus I do need him to eat something; if all his meals go in the bin with nothing 'till the next meal childhood obesity won't be an issue in this house.
Yesterday, MLK Day, is interesting….I can’t remember what we did! I remember some things….we had leftovers for dinner, I worked on cleaning my tow bar (more about that later), but why can’t I remember what we did for exercise??? I think retirement must be getting to me.

And yes, there is even a marijuana counterpart to the cigar. In the early 1990s the inner cities gave birth to a new practice called “blunting,” in which cheap cigars are gutted and stuffed with marijuana. It is fitting that this practice originated in the same place where gangs come from. An inner-city gang seems supremely concerned with honor and courage: its elaborate codes would suggest as much. But seeming is one thing, being another. The gang-member fancies himself honorable, but is in reality a thug. Just as the cigar is the counterpart to the real virtues of honor and courage, the marijuana-blunt is the counterpart to the fake virtues of gang-honor and gang-courage.

If you ask him to show you the truth, he will show you. He’s not that far from any of us (Acts 17:27).

The Flight Path Debrief program for flight attendants is on a roller coaster ride at this particular point. You remember...the program the took me to Seattle for 69 nights last year. That I devoted hundreds of hours to helping design. Along with 23 others. Thousands of hours and dollars to develop a top-notch grade A program is now in flux. Do we want it? Should we revise it? Let's just say that I'm tired of corporate politics. Let's just say that I'm tired of non-flight attendants thinking that they know what's best for flight attendants. I know, I know....be flexible, nimble, open minded. I'm trying. But I'm more than definitely happy to be back flying full time. Away from the office. Away from the fray of office and corporate life.

If you are reading this, then you are One who has qualified to serve the Divine Plan at a greater level. There are always other roads to travel and worlds to discover and conquer. We speak here of the growth of the Soul, Dear Ones.

I think, also, that the threat of copyright infringement as expressed in online piracy (I won’t call it theft, because I own a dictionary) has been grossly overstated – the figures don’t add up at all – and is a panic sparked by the collapse of obsolete business models beneath the feet of people who made far too much money selling CDs to people who owned the same data on Vinyl. Supply exploded, Demand didn’t, Prices collapsed. That’s why the music industry failed, piracy was only ever a sideshow.

Reproduction by budding occurs in thousands of species, and has gone on with few modifications for half a billion years. What makes the jellyfish Turritopsis nutricula so special is that once it reproduces, it doesn't die, but transforms itself back into its juvenile polyp state, resembling a stalk with tentacles like a tiny sea urchin. Their adult cells--even their eggs and sperm--melt into simpler forms of themselves, and the whole organism becomes "young" again. Barring any sea-borne dangers, there is no biological reason why it can't live forever.

Well done to Sherry of A Little Colour Every Day :
It's 10 am, in a Scottish branch of 1ne of those horrible adjunct supermarket cafes that dot the landscape, blight it in many ways, enhance it in others. Sure, they are soul-less, manned by embittered plooky face plump lassies who hiss your order by elongating the final syllable of the word, but hey, the coffees cheap. It is what it is. I find the strangest thing about going back to Scotland is that the little differences, after a long time away, jar more than the obvious 1nes. Sure, there may be a bewildering series of new roads to travail and stranges rules and regulations to decipher such as the 2 queue system in the bakery, but alcohol sold in the supermarket? Wee women in coats pushing trollies THAT quickly? Mind spin. My coffee, well, it's swirling, frothing, spinning and dancing in milky patterns around in my mind. I wonder if I concentrate just hard enough, I can make a dolphin appear in it's swirling patterns, like a Magic Eye picture. If I could, I'd probably sit in this faux cane chair forever. I'd probably fall in love with 1ne of the plooky face plump lassies and we'd raise plooky faced wee weans and argue about money every Saturday night over a Chicken Madras while Ant & Dec comedically bicker on our TV screens. Who knows what might have been right? I've got Smoosh on the IPOD, for no discernible reason. Across my shoulder, a youth in a red hooded top is blanking out his girlfriend, herself being all bad hair weave and over ambitious gestures arguing about money I presume. I tend to find in Scotland, the girls are very over dramatic with their gestures, clipping the end of their words, throwing their hands up in the air trying to communicate to emotionally stunted boys with lifeless eyes who are too busy thinking about football or boxing or something...I lifelessly watch him for a moment, stirring my coffee in opposite circles simply to break the monotony. I know life will go on of course, I could stare into the middle distance forever, stirring coffee, making patterns, hitting the repeat button on my Smoosh album until I got tenure of the faux cane chair in some sort of retirement ceremony. I could sit all day wondering why so many Scottish girls are so angry...but once We Our Own Lies finishes, I sadly know time is up...a rented suit waits for no man...

I do have a fridge...but, it is in the basement. For the past week, every time I have needed a chilled item, I have had to go out into the back entryway and down some steep, old-house basement stairs...and then back up again with whatever I needed...and then back down again for whatever I forgot...wash, rinse, repeat as necessary.
A side effect, which I would never have thought of, is that now my tango partners can clearly feel through my embrace, not only which foot I am on and where it is, but exactly where my hips are in rotation. You can lead one of those little forward and back floor-level boleos, where the free leg just does a little curl around the standing leg, and you can feel the whole movement happening. I can tell that they can tell exactly how I am doing it, softly or sharply. A movement that seemed nice-looking but otherwise fairly pointless, suddenly becomes a true sensual pleasure for both of us, and a way for my partner to hear my music.
If there’s one thing that I would like to change about this wedding planning, it would be to choose a easir color motif to work on!! I had trouble searching for the exact hue of greenish/blue that I like and same thing goes for our bridesmaid dresses so we ended up with a fabric that is more of a bluish without a tiny hint of green! Disappointing! But I’m over it now. My problem is, our invites are green and my bridesmaid dresses would be blue so I modified the color motif to be blue, green, gray and old rose.

This needs to be changed immediately, instead of local groups paying HQ the local groups should be getting funding from HQ with printers, software, leaflets etc... to ensure that we can run effective and proper campaigns. Was it really appropriate that all local groups had to raise every nearly every penny spent in the General Election? Local groups should have been supported by HQ, however their own mismanagement meant that there was no support or assistance.
This isn’t a new revelation. I’ve known I would be an awful caveman since the first time I heard about Otzi, the caveman who was found frozen in a block of ice. They say he was most likely killed by a rock to the head. No doubt I, much like Otzi, would have been murdered during this time period. Sometimes sarcasm can get you in trouble, particularly with prehistoric men who are still baffled by fire.
And then we were off. The three hour drive back to Chicago. I stopped and grabbed some passion fruit iced tea from Starbucks before we headed onto the highway. I ate a raw revolution 100 calorie bar yesterday also during our drive. So when we arrived home, needless to say, me and kyle were STARVING to say the least. Good thing my parents were prepared for our hungry bodies. She prepared her famous meatloaf! I’m sorry I have no pictures. It was all scarfed down by the time I thought about it.

We shared this meal all together, and it was nice because my sister, her husband, and my nephew came too! I was so pleasantly surprised!

I had never used a moisturizing candle and had no idea what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by how moisturizing the candle was. It was not heavy or sticky at all. It rubbed right into my skin and was really good on my dry elbows. There are 9 scents to choose from as well as Soy Massage Melts that are made to be melted in any tart or electric warmer. Apricot oil is used in both the candles and melts which is rich in vitamin E, and known for its gentle moisturizing properties.
Meditation: How can one know for certain that Jesus is truly the Son of God and Savior of the world? Philip, a new disciple of Jesus, at first failed to convince his friend Nathaniel that he had found the Messiah. Nathanial was very skeptical. He didn’t like Nazareth and didn’t want to have anything to do with people who came from such a place. How could the Messiah come from a town at the crossroads with gentiles and people of other religions? Perhaps we are like Nathanial. We reject others out of rivalry or prejudice, or we keep them at a distance because we find fault with something about them, whether it be their manners, dress, customs, associations, or whatever we dislike about them and their kind. Rather than argue with his friend, Philip took the wiser strategy of inviting Nathaniel to “come and see” for himself who this Jesus claimed to be. Clever arguments rarely win people to the gospel, but a genuine encounter with the person of Jesus Christ can transform one’s life forever.

Defense against heresy, especially wolves within the church, is an important aspect of faithful biblical leadership. However, when such defense becomes the primary purpose of leadership, the church’s focus turns to important but peripheral issues and in turn distracts them from engaging the world and people around them with the gospel. Right doctrine should not lead people to disengage with the world, but rather, with a courageous meekness, seek to transform it!

So when a complete stranger emailed to ask me to coffee to discuss his job search, I immediately agreed. He found me through a mutual acquaintance, who thought I might be able to share some insight on career opportunities in the startup world.
Last night was the season finale of The Biggest Loser on NBC. If you have never seen it, the show centers on overweight contestants trying to lose weight to win a cash prize. The person who loses the highest percentage of weight loss over the course of the show wins. Many have criticized the show’s techniques as aggressive and unrealistic. After all, how many people can live on a ranch and dedicate themselves full-time to achieving their weight loss goal? How many people can realistically lose 15 pounds in a week? And keep it off?

House Speaker John Boehner told rank-and-file Republicans in a conference call after Saturday’s meeting that he hoped to be able to announce a “viable framework for progress” by 4 p.m. EDT on Sunday, before the stock markets open in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, according to two participants.

The US Embassy said the move to focus on Ekneligoda was to add pressure to the Sri Lankan Government to carry out the pursuit of justice in the case of the missing cartoonist, who was abducted and reported missing on 24 January 2010 – two days before the presidential election in which he was a supporter of the defeated candidate former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka.

Until our Silicon Valley Geek Tour day I had only driven past the Android Statue Garden, also located along Charleston Road in front of building 44. There you can pose beside big sculptures of the Android OS codename icons: Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb and Ice Cream Sandwich. There's also a huge Android sculpture and the arch that forms the main entrance to the building is another rendition of the android complete with tiny green antennae along the roofline.

On the planet of the Gonds, the Doctor broke the people's enslavement by the crystalline beings known as Krotons. Back to guess where: Earth, in the twenty first century, the Ice Warriors were back. This time with the intention of colonising the Earth for themselves by landing deadly seeds to make the planet inhospitable to humans.
Aside from that, we also have a language that is incomprehensible to non dressage people. Just for fun (how dressage nerdy is that - I find this fun), I started coming up with a list of words and phrases we use, in the English language, that have an incomprehensible meaning to non dressage people. Some are used by other disciplines, some are specific to dressage. Here's my list:

I might send her a slide show of all the photos of my flowers so she could do a presentation with them. My macros seem to be cropped so you can't see the glaring weeds or creeping Charlie or bad gardening skills. I also don't have a drop of mulch to make my place look better.

Contrary to Singaporeans’ claims that only PAP MPs can do better a job in government, this does not seem to support such wild claims. In fact if Singaporeans are right that there are no politicians other than those in PAP who can do a better job, then going by the efficiency and effectiveness of these Malay MPs clearly indicate Singapore is in serious trouble.
What is my favorite Weezer song? I decided on “Say It Ain’t So,” but “Buddy Holly” is now stuck in my head. I’m no Mary Tyler Moore, but that’s a good song.
1. How do you encourage each other in the marriage? Show me a man that is encouraged by his wife who thinks he can do anything, and I will show you man that can conquer the world. On the flip side, show me a woman who is not lifted up by her husband, and I will show you a woman who is defeated. Christ has got to be the center of your encouragement in your marriage for your marriage to make it. PERIOD!
On the other hand, the alfar had no interest in joining with the newly reunited crew, feeling those in positions of power were far too warlike and aggressive compared to the peaceful vanir (with whom they continued some relations). They removed themselves farther north into the mountains, and endeavored to have as little contact with the immigrants as possible.

This is a relatively new learning for me. I constantly question my clients on the stories that they tell themselves. Sometimes those stories are not easy to spot for yourself. I am no exception. Once you have spent time (and I mean REAL time) on building your vision for the future you need to commit to its attainment. You will already be moving forward and you should also have developed a plan of action (more about that in the forthcoming book ’10 things I’ve learned about success.’) Once you have a vision and a plan you need to constantly check your commitment to your own vision. If you don’t have faith in your path you will get distracted by the views of others. Sometimes that’s a good thing. It is always better to surround yourself with advisors BUT in the cold light of day YOUR success has to be YOUR responsibility. That means it is your job to decide if you take the advice or not. Does it fit with your vision and your plan? If decision making is something that you find difficult then now is the time to work on it. For years decision making has been one of my weaknesses (hows that for sharing!?!) but you can improve by taking small steps and conditioning your mind to certainty. Process all of the information you have. All of the advice you get and then stick to what you decide. Only then can you review your choices and alter your course if necessary.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think parents should hover anxiously around their children and never allow independence. Let me remind you there IS a third option. You don't have to choose between forcing independence and never allowing it. Between removing the safety net and using it as a trap. The third option looks like knowing your child, talking to your child, respecting the level of independence your child wishes to have. It looks like making that safety net available, and using it properly so it doesn't trap your child. I wrote about this kind of thing in Choosing Your Guide.

It is finally warm and seemingly beautiful outside, but yet this spring I’ve got allergies (my eyes hurt as if I’ve forgotten to take out contacts and went to sleep in them. hell,that happened once and now I’m experiencing it on a daily basis,hope it passes:p). My computer decided to support me in a weird way…by catching some hideous virus, both r better now:) and it is still great outside.
As soon as I got home, I opened one of the bottles of ginger ale, filled my glass with ice cubes and the bubbly brew, and then took a sip. The familiar taste was there, but the ginger ale was missing the effervescence I wanted. All the bottles later proved to be just as flat.
By the time I had to go back to the Saint Francis ER for the third time on Tuesday, as it was now approaching sundown, Lela sufficiently calmed me down to the point that I did not act on primal instinct in dealing with the lunacy of this ER doctor. “How fucking hard is it?” I kept asking Lela rhetorically on the bus rides back to Nob Hill. “How hard is it to read the label of a spent goddamn prescription bottle and copy that information onto an RX scrip?”

I could go on but I won't. Needless to say, 1000's of people die around the world daily but unless they are of great importance to Australia or USA we do not acknowledge these victims. They may get a brief story in the paper or on the news but they are not given the same value as others.
Another aspect that makes this movie interesting is that there's less emphasis on muscle-men in skirts doing stupid strong-man acts than is typical and quite a bit of time spent of developing the civilization of Atlantis. I've always been keen on any films and stories that feature Atlantis, and this is one of the better ones I've encountered. The evil priests and spellcasters, the decadent queen so obsessed with power that she is willing to kill her own daughter (played by the very cute Laura Atlan), and the brave and virtuous heroes struggling against the tide of evil reminded me very much of my favorite Atlantis novel, "The Lost Continent."

Have you ever noticed that a lot of folks talk so much LOUDER when they are speaking into their mobile phone? Or, as it's called in North America, a cell phone. A phone in your cell? I'm sure that wouldn't be allowed. However, I saw a documentary on how you get said phone into said cell. Cell phone equals smell phone.....

Maybe he didn’t recognize her but I actually think that he did. At least I hope that he did… this is already Episode 12.
For the top and bottom rosettes I cut the cupid from the Sweethearts cartridge at 3 1/2". I cut the shadow from black and the cupid from red. I then sprayed the cupid with the Tattered Rose and Black Cherry glimmer mist and the coated it lightly with the Pinata Glimmer Glaze that I just got from Cutters Creek. (It is beautiful). Finally I added some Thistle Stickles to the heart for added glitz.

From the humour to the action it’s all been done great. Nobody else could make this character as serous and funny as Arnold Schwarzenegger did and will never be able to replace his ability to do that. A great example of this would be when Harry Tasker has to chase a terrorist through New York with the terrorist on a motorbike and Harry on a police horse “and please hurry, my horse is getting tired” nobody could do that line as serious and without humour in their voice as Schwarzenegger. This must have been the first film I had seen with Schwarzenegger in and clearly put me on the right path of action and comedy films, in saying that I was only 8 years old so might explain a lot about my opinions (not sure why my parents let me see this when I was 8 but am not complaining).
Although I was uncertain about the cream cheese, I was really surprised at how well it went with all the other ingredients and the creaminess it added to the sandwich.

4. Unlike the Chicago Cubs, the Boston Redsox have experienced a lot of success recently. After Theo Epstein took over, the Redsox won two WS championships in 2004 and 2007 and made the playoffs six times in ten years. The firing of Terry Francona at the end of last year was and still is a mystery to me. It was not at all his fault for his players lack of ability to perform at the beginning and at the end of last year. Bbobby Valentine was finally selected and given his rightful place as a manger in the MLB once again.

Quite a few pundits are convinced that the GOP will indeed nominate Sarah Palin for the Presidency in 2012.

I have had to devote some paragraphs, here, to show why the alleged hallmarks of poverty are not as simple as some assume. I could continue in this vein for a while longer. This is not to completely discount the horror stories. But deprivation — of education, of mentally healthy conditions, of a good life — flourishes across the economic spectrum, although in different ways. Having little money and being impoverished are not the same thing at all. Uchitelle was on the right track, but apparently there were limits to how far a person might carry the point in a New York Times essay.

Finn is taking it in stride. I keep thinking of him having a saucy English butler voice, and saying things like, “Chap your breath is dreadful.” when Saint walks up to sniff him. (Saint takes garlic pills to keep the fleas and ticks off, so his breath is truly dreadful.) Could be because I named him after a saucy English gentleman. Could be because that’s the voice that came to me in my head for him. Wubbies has a squeaky 3-year-old voice. Roo had a matronly voice. The ducks had a French accent.–YES, I do voice impersonations for ALL of my pets, (with the exception of Saint–he’s so freaking smart, what he does screams what he is thinking) It makes the day a lot more fun. I DID have to HAVE a smart dog, DIDN’T I? Sometimes I wonder if Saint isn’t as smart as a two-year old.

I had a professor that said asking a plant person what their favorite plant is akin to asking a mother who her favorite child is. I'll dodge the question like a politician by saying I like the right plant for the right place at the right time. In early summer, I love Turk's cap so I can watch the hummingbirds fight over the blooms. Just before fall comes, I love my fig tree just as the fruit ripens, especially when I beat the blue jays to it! In winter I love my river birch that is settled into the low spot in the backyard because of the unique bark. I just have to touch it! In spring, the fragrance of the 'Souvenir de la Malmaison' rose reminds me of the rose water my grandmother sprayed in her hair. What plant should no garden go without? The one that brings you joy.

Two-thirds of the fossils obtained from the site so far belong to plants still alive today. Some, on the other hand, are the fossils of very rare plants that have not yet been identified. This site has a structure rich in silica, making it easier to obtain very well-preserved specimens. Their details make it possible to compare them comprehensively to those organisms’ specimens living today—which comparison again shows that living things have been the same for tens of millions of years. In other words, they have not evolved.
It all began with the building of To'ata Amphitheater right next to the lagoon ten or so years ago. A walking area with brick patio stones shaded by frangipani trees was built around this prime theater and a few good restaurants sprung up in the water-view pedestrian only area. A few years later the Vaiete Roullotte area at the other end of the waterfront got a facelift with a little gazebo for live bands, more paved areas, trees and some great public restrooms. This was followed by the building of a fancy new tourist office (with more great public restrooms - much needed in Papeete) and a little crafts market near the Moorea Ferry docks.

When we went to the library on Thursday, Emma was drawn to the bin of board books. Seeing as she likes to listen to books that are geared towards kids who are 8 and older (we are currently listening to Inkdeath, the third in the Inkheart Trilogy), I figured she should also be able to read/listen to the books geared towards kids 3 and under. Plus, I got to sit in the super comfy extra wide glider rocker to look through my books while she searched for hers.

McLaren have followed their own strategy on the DRS rear wing this season. In contrast to other teams McLaren have designed their wing for the best Non-DRS Performance, thus when deployed the DRs provides a more modest boost in speed. This Strategy appears to have been reviewed as their new rear wing tested at Silverstone shows.
It eventually got to the point to where I had to visit the boutique every single time I was nearby. I knew I belonged there because every time I went into a Betsey boutique (whether it was the Lenox location or the Perimeter location), I got offered a job or got asked if I was a Betsey model. Unfortunately, since both locations were pretty far away for a minimum wage job, I couldn't apply. But a girl can dream, right?

Channeling also must be approached with caution. There are spirits that would like to enter into the human being, who may masquerade as higher beings to come into us. We should not offer our minds and hearts for other beings to dwell in, unless we are truly convinced of their spiritual nature. It is important that we do not give up our consciousness or witnessing capacity in the process of communicating with any spirit.

Now that we have the pounds formula, we can fill in the blanks with what we know to solve for gallons. We know that any time we see the word “new,” we are to use 50 ppm. The constant 8.34 (lbs/gallon) is the weight of water. For MG (million gallons), we have to figure the volume inside a 10-inch pipe that is 6,000 feet long. To determine MG, use the volume formula of a cylinder. Also remember to convert cubic feet to gallons by using the conversion of 7.48. This is used because 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons. We also need to convert the percent purity to decimal form, so we divide our percent by 100.

And what about fairness for families? It’s in our families that America’s most important work gets done: raising our next generation. But over the last 40 years, as inflation has shrunk the personal exemption, families with children have had to shoulder more and more of the tax burden. With inflation and bracket-creep also eroding incomes, many spouses who would rather stay home with their children have been forced to go looking for jobs. And what of America’s promise of hope and opportunity, that with hard work even the poorest among us can gain the security and happiness that is the due of all Americans? You can’t put a price tag on the American dream. That dream is the heart and soul of America; it’s the promise that keeps our nation forever good and generous, a model and hope to the world.
Now, I am not suggesting that all of this measurement is a good thing; in fact, I think that much of it is superfluous at best, and potentially damaging. But it is pervasive in many aspects of our lives. Since most of these assessments are designed with an outcome in mind or an understanding of what "good" looks like, the concepts of measurement, outcomes, and "pass/fail" are driven into us from an early age. As such, we face a significant uphill battle when we attempt to approach our lives a different way; like when we decide to unschool, for example.

Papaw had one glass eye. To get a rise out of us girls, he would pretend to sneeze and then pop his eye out onto the kitchen table! Uh, just thinking about it grosses me out. Last year, he was Willy Nelson for the church festival. He was so cool.
See now, I don't think that writers (except those who write poetry or literature) have that problem. BUT, what does happen is that their professor will say to them "What do you mean by that."
"What I think might be of most interest is what I was doing in the performance and how I was controlling the synthesizers. There is a white headband that I am wearing which contains three electrodes which are monitoring my brain waves using a biofeedback machine. This biofeedback monitor would register a small voltage pulse each time that I could successfully maintain a relatively steady alpha state. The brain biofeedback monitor is then connected to an optical interface. This allows me to use the feedback voltage to control the synthesizers without the risk of a ground loop frying my brain. The control voltage of about five volts was then used to control the pitch and filters of the EML 101 and also advance step by step the sequencer on the EML 4004/401. The result was that I could control and play the synthesizers with brain waves alone.
While Im not a fan of the writing the season that featured Doctor 9, I do appreciate the thought that RTD put into crafting this version and the way he was portrayed.

Hone your abilities and your confidence by incorporating negotiation into your everyday life. You’re liable to be pleasantly surprised by the receipt of a few unexpected benefits. When making large purchases, bring your checkbook. Ask the store clerk (who will have to consult the manager) what the discount is when you pay by check rather than by credit card (merchant credit card processing fees cost more money).

As Christians we know that God’s Word tells us that the Old Testament men of faith were a foreshadowing of the Christ. I can see it oh so plainly in Moses’ words after his stand at the entrance to the camp was said and done…

The reason it takes him “so long between one fiction and the next” is “not not ‘having an idea,’ but having ten or twenty ideas, and having to wait as patiently as possible for the relations among them to reveal themselves. …the mind, unable to bear the richness of consequence entailed upon one idea, forthwith produces another instead.”

I'm sharing another She-Art girl today. For this one, I closely followed Christy's video where she showed how to make a scene with your She-Art girl. I started with some blue paper for the sky, green toned papers for the grass and then covered most of the paper with paint. I built up the scene from there.
Taking us back to the origins of Yom Hazikaron, The Times of Israel has published an extraordinary 2-part series of the diary of a British clergyman who was caught in Jerusalem during the fierce fighting in May 1948 during Israel’s War of Independence.

Pascal Gebert, Sales Manager, Zermatt Tourism with the support of local partners had privatised an area for us at the foot of the Matterhorn. This was our “field of dreams” in which to enact a serious of snow challenges and accumulate more precious points. TeamMilkCan, unfortunately, took a long time to locate the buried treasure and didn’t manage to muster a sufficiently co-ordinated effort to complete the team “ski” challenge in anything like regulation time. The jury is still out as to why this was the case – was the problem at the back or in the middle of the skis? All I’m saying is that it wasn’t at the front! The all-female sub group (ie, everyone except me!) also struggled with the weight challenge (no comment!!!) mistaking 17kgs for 11kgs and dropping more points, but not kilos! We persevered, however, and, with bountiful reciprocal love and true mutual forgiveness, launched ourselves into the bridge building contest with spectacular results.
I love to read and have always been a voracious reader. One of the best parts of not doing anything is that I have a lot of extra time to read! Here are some reviews of books I've read recently.
A friend of mine had mentioned that I should start a cooking blog not too long ago, since I've been following those religiously for quite some time. Well I liked the idea, but never did it. I LOVE to bake, and craft, and do just about anything so I figured hey, why not?
The Fighter may not quite scale the boxing film tower of greatness, but it is a rousing melodrama with galvanizing performances by all of the abovementioned. Best of all, the movie neatly balances itself between the all-the-way, astoundingly showy depiction of the herky-jerky ball-of-misspent-fire that is crack-addicted Dicky by Bale, and the admirably restrained, astonishingly vanity-less, and largely reactive (but heartfelt) choices of Wahlberg as Micky.

Also in this busy week, I hope to be able to spend some time with my wonderful boyfriend Jason. As spring comes both of us are busy doing our own things, the only time I get to see him really is after 8 pm every night when I come home! I really want for him to come up and watch my lesson on Sunday. Since it will be raining he can't go fishing! Lol

The Metropolis study, on the other hand, goes back to 1970 and lumps everything into one immigration system. Here's the problem with that. By doing so all the costs of the current immigration system can be masked or ameliorated by previous cohorts of immigrants who brought value to the nation instead of mostly absorbing the benefits. It's like having a really mediocre sports team win the championship because of three star players who do most of the work and score the majority of points, but once all three are gone from the team it descends into last place.

The raised fist salute consists of raising the right arm with a clenched fist (preferably with a white glove). The clenched fist symbolizes strength, honour and defiance against the Marxist tyrants of Europe while the white glove symbolizes purity, duty, kinship and martyrdom.

Along with these must be cited the words and illustrations of Scripture in which God makes it known how well He is pleased with true repentance or amendment, made in faith and reliance on His Word – such as, in the Old Testament the examples of Kings David, Ahab, Mannasseh, and the like; in the New Testament of St. Peter, the malefactor, the publican in the Gospel, and so forth. Although I know that to the scholars and saints, who need no repentance, this advice of mine will be laughable and that they hold it for a simple and common thing which they have long since got beyond; nevertheless, I have not been willing to omit for the sake of myself and sinners like myself, who need both repentance and exhortation to repentance every day. In spite of it, we remain all too lazy and lax, and have not, with those “ninety and nine just persons,” got so far over the hill as they permit themselves to think they have.
JAS: You write a lot about your (sometimes raunchy) life, and you’ve blogged for Babble about your first child’s life as a baby. Has the relationship between your life and your writing changed because of fatherhood—for example, do you feel yourself to be reluctant to write down certain experiences? As your kids get older, how are their lives going to fit into your writing, if at all?

God knows my heart and my prayers even before I do. I've been praying about my job for a long time and have been trying my best to let go of the small things, to not bring it home with me, to do my best work and let it go. But I apparently needed a big demonstration to really get the point.

This morning, a vastly expansive essay by Lew Spellman of the University of Texas in Austin titled "Warren Buffett and the New Calculus of Gold" is making the rounds, and while the narrative is largely defensive of gold, and its role as the only true safe collateral in a world rapidly depleted of the latter (as we have been arguing for the past two years) as proven over and over by the fact that the entire modern system now relies more on re-re-re-rehypothection of existing collateral than on spending money for CapEx purposes and to replace an aging asset base, we wonder: is this realization really just now being grasped by the world?
Here is my newest piece from my Gnostic Picturebook. This image is inspired by Liber Al vel Legis, Ch II, v. 20: “Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us. ” It is a direct follow-through of the the theme explored in my last piece:

Growing up, I always loved the octagon side table in the living room so I found that gave a similar vibe - and then added another all in gold. Twin 1960's Murano glass lamps on top add some more circles and some more color. I'm going with all different shades of green, teal, turquoise and aqua.
I believe video games also aid in developing problem-solving abilities and they help to keep the mind active and sharp. Truthfully, I don't have the patience to play most modern video games. I'm really impressed with how far the craft has developed but I don't feel particularly motivated to figure them out. There is a level of immersion that I'm just not willing to allow into my life. I play a lot of Chess. The violence implied in Chess isn't nearly as visceral as those in modern video games, and few would have any opposition to their kids playing more Chess, so a logical question to ask is whether or not the problem lies in the level of realism achieved in the gaming world..
Being a Muslim just added more into the mix. See, Malays were originally pagans, and then we were Hindus, so the traditions we practiced mixed all of it up. They find ways to mix things up to sit with the local beliefs, I guess. However, when I was in University, it was the uprising of the Islamic movement, and to be honest, I think I accepted it better than some of my aunts did. After all, where they had balls and dances, and my father pretty much spent his university days drunk (I don’t think he did very well, but he’s a master at bullshit so he got by), while I was in uni, we had prayer sessions, and girls who didn’t wear the head cover were looked at with disgust. In fact, in pre-university, I was made very popular when my name was put up in a poster that advertised the girls who were going to go to hell for not covering our hair.
I would put the “ferociously” racist black proportion at closer to 20 percent, and the passive supporters at an additional 70 percent. But I don’t expect Derbyshire to talk like that. He has much less experience with blacks, and I’m radioactive, which he wasn’t… until a few hours ago.

The atheists behind the sign said they were trying to draw attention to the state House’s recent designation of 2012 as “The Year of the Bible” — an action by lawmakers that the atheists have called offensive. Indeed they did draw attention but only to themselves. It’s one thing to make a point using visual stimuli, but there is a line that no one should ever cross and this organization has crossed the line.
Of course popping to see my grandparents was never a problem. The number of times as a really young child of 6 or 7 that I used to disappear from home or even school at lunchtime and turn up at my grandparents house was incredible. It was more remarkable because from where we lived at the time to get to their house I had to walk over a mile and cross at least one major road. I got into so much trouble for my little escapes.
I assure you thats not all thats really going on in the world. We believe that Assad should get out of power cause of the massacre of the syrian people but its a far bigger picture than that. From the leaked emails, we can see that the super powers are deliberately stalling the syrian strike because Assad can possibly go down in a bang and throw his army on the Israelis which STRATFOR believes will get the other arabs involved since Israel is the big enemy to the Arabs. It doesnt matter how many people are dying, every single email that got leaked that has to do with countries and relations, involve Israel. So who is really the world’s super power? Still believe its the US? Have a good long read on Assad and how connected he is to the Israeli mossad and British MI6.

This month has been so much fun with these little ones. They are getting so big and smiling more and more each day. They are on a pretty good schedule and typically eat and sleep about around the same times. Right about their 3 month birthday they began to sleep longer stretches. SK will sleep all night most nights and Shepard usually requires one late night or middle of the night feeding. I have stopped waking SK in the middle of the night when Shep eats because we have learned she does not need it and will sleep right through him eating and she will be able to last until morning or when he eats again. We are not worried about this because the girl does not look to be starving! :)

One of the wonderful things about my journey over these past few months is noticing my own resilience grow stronger. There are days when my anxiety resurfaces, there are triggers that are akin to a ‘knock’ but now it is different. Firstly, I don’t fall so hard or so far. Secondly, it doesn’t take nearly so long to get back up again. It’s an incredible feeling to know you have survived, it’s even more empowering to know that you WILL survive. I know I will still experience adversity but I now have the confidence in myself to cope and the tools to help me do so.

Surprise at the current Greek debt crisis rattling the Eurozone is not shared by everyone. Some suspect that the Greek character has long accepted things the Swedish character, for example, has not. Many have even commented on it, but few have gone so far as to publicly state that these character differences could run very deeply indeed. Deeply in the Greek and Swedish veins. Perhaps even to the DNA level. Those who do believe it runs this deep are fairly sure the Eurozone project was doomed from the start. Greeks, like it or not, will never be Germans, until they start fiddling with themselves in the petri dish.

One of the flours is a bit crunchy - maybe the flaxseed or almond meal? Tastes very nutty... and even though I followed the recipe exactly as I always have, save for the flour substitutions and using less oil - the muffins are waaaay too sweet. I drink sweet tea, love chocolate, dream of pastries - and for me to say something is too sweet, that's saying something.

The Human Immunodeficiency Virus: a retrovirus only 120 nanometers in diameter. It is 60 times smaller than a red blood cell and yet has killed more people than World War I, The Civil War and The Vietnam War combined. The most apt descriptor of HIV is that it is simply infectious and just in an epidemiological sense. HIV can take a community and eat away at it from the inside, leaving people bereft of hope and despondent. Theoretically, HIV doesn’t discriminate based on age, race, gender or socioeconomic status. And yet, here in Baltimore, we are disproportionately affected by this disease. We are in the top 5 in the nation in a category that you don’t want to on top of. In our own backyard, the 21201 zip code that houses The JACQUES Initiative and The University of Maryland-Baltimore, almost 6% of the population is HIV positive. Yesterday, leaders from the HIV, academic, business and healthcare communities came together to begin the arduous process of preparing a future where HIV is no longer a chronic and insurmountable public health issue, but is clarion call for neighborhood and city unity.

The overdue draft aviation policy is expected to be published this summer along with a call for evidence on hub airport capacity. Walsh and others, notably the airport operator BAA, have long argued that a hub airport – one sufficiently large to allow connecting passengers to fill long-haul routes – is crucial and that Heathrow, Britain’s only hub, is no longer big enough to allow flights to new destinations. As the owner of British Airways and Spain’s Iberia, IAG is the largest airline group at Heathrow.

The problem I had now was that I had defined myself by my job and “didn’t have the time” to do things that I wanted. At the time I was living on the floor of my parents landing and living out of a bag. Six months went by of living like this. So I decided that I’d get my own place but as I didn’t really have any close friends I moved in with a friend of my sisters. We became great friends over this time but I had no balance to my life so all I did was work all week and spend weekends on my own. Not overly fulfilling.

The word of God puts coveteousness right in with fornication and uncleaness. To have coveteousness is to strongly desire something you really dont need. It is to think about it a lot. The dictionary says: “To wish for longingly.” Our tradition of having our children make a list of what they want needs to be tempered so that it does not lead to coveteousness. It is okay to want something, and to give something. But we need to be careful not to breed a spirit of coveteousness in them. Make sure they realize we are giving gifts to one another in honor of Jesus’ gift to us. Make sure they are involved in giving as well as getting.

No post on Baltimore would be complete without at least a menion of one its most notable natives, Billy Baldwin. Although no longer completely intact, the William Woodward Gallery at the Baltimore Museum of Art in the added Woodward Wing (by architects Wrenn, Lewis, and Jencks) reveals a sensitive and interesting approach to presentation. Intended by benefactor Mrs. William Woodward, Sr., to showcase her late husband's renown collection of British sporting paintings in a setting that more resembled a Georgian country house hall than a typical museum gallery of the time, Baldwin was brought in to design the installation in conjunction with the patron, architect, and museum director.
This is the front of the card. After the video, I added glossy accents to the alligator and white gel pen to the blue behind him.

I'm not sure where the gold bop letters came from. The dark blue and white card stock is from my scrap stash. The alligator is cut from Animal Kingdom.

You think the cardio equipment is like penance for the BBQ you had this weekend, right? It’s not, sorry! The food plan is your only way to be successful. The gym is only the polishing. As always, I want to give you all the food plan FIRST, let you go to the store and get ready before I introduce the work-out program. Additionally, the work-out programs are individualized.

My “Golden Ticket” was one that was going to change my, and my children’s lives, pretty much forever. Up to that point, I’d always been half of a partnership. Had someone to either a) take care of everything or b) help take care of everything. I’d been a wife and a mother, but I’d never ever been independent. Ever. The burden was going to be 100000% on my shoulders, and no one else’s. That’s not to say that I haven’t had help…Phil is a perfect business partner and his contributions have been of course, invaluable. John’s help has been essential.

I just thought I'd write a quick note on here to tell you my AS and A2 results. I've just been into school to collect them.

I just need to continue my incredibly hard work and hope :)

Once again I stood still and listened. Finally Helicopter Butt whimpered again, and I realized that he was close by. Spotting a brief movement out of the corner of my eye, I shone my flashlight over into the neighboring yard and spotted just the top of his head peaking out of what appeared to be a hole. I somehow--fuzzy slippers and all--managed to scale a chest-high retaining wall and what I saw took my breath away: Helicopter Butt--my sweet, beloved, precious little dog--was drowning in a neighbor's pool.

For many years their areas of special interest did not overlap, so they did not tend to be up for the same awards or invited to the same festivals. Emily focussed largely on urban subjects; Sylvia’s work was strictly metaphysical. But then – an example of convergent evolution – both Sylvia and Emily became interested in birds. Perhaps they both received literature from the RSPB during the same mailing campaign. Perhaps they both were given bird feeders as Christmas presents by totally unrelated relatives. Whatever the reason, both writers began to produce reams of poems about our feathered friends …

And yet, though now a Quaker, I still call myself a Pisky, because of such people as John Shelby Spong and Marcus J Borg- the latter’s striking arguments that a Biblical Christian is a Liberal, not Evangelical, Christian delight me. And in Scotland, Richard Holloway, former Bishop of Edinburgh, and Derek Rawcliffe, former Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway, the first Anglican bishop to disclose publicly that he was gay, in 1995 (after he had retired).

I stamped the image in blue ink then borrowed my pal's matching label punch to cut it out (I've got this punch on my Wish List, so hope to get it in a later order). The small dots under the main image were cut with my SU! 1/2" circle punch from a scrap of navy blue cardstock. The ribbon has been lurking in the bottom of my ribbon bag for ages, so I thought it was about time it saw the light of day ! I added a touch of Glossy Accents to the bear's party hat (well I think you all know how much I love my GA !!) but it isn't showing up on the pic. I hope the Birthday Boy likes his card.

So last year, during my attendance at the Encaustic Conference, I began to think about the need to get a career consultation, and I have begun this process with Joanne Mattera, it was very eye opening. It has helped me begin to take a long hard look at my business model, from the name, "Supria's Designs", to my website, cv, bio and the ever elusive artist statement. I highly recommend getting a consultation....it got my butt moving....

I know that plans don’t work for everyone, but I definitely suggest trying them, especially when it comes to weight loss. Since I have fallen off the wagon a bit during this last week, and fully intend to hit the ground running, I wanted to give myself a preparation period. Once you make sure that you have everything you need and you are ready to get started with any diet and exercise plan you choose, there are no excuses. Stick to the plan. If you do not change, nothing else will. Sorry this blog was a bit more serious, but I take this seriously. So I will leave you all with a little bit of motivation to get you on your way.
an eco-friendly line of sunglasses hand-crafted from sustainable bamboo. What’s even more impressive than its array of colors black, brown, and natural, and silhouettes ranging from Monroe, Robinson, Aviator, Martin, and Kennedy, with Nelson being my favorite, is that for each pair sold, PANDA donates an eye exam and a prescription pair of sunglasses to someone in need. I can’t think of a better reason to shop.
When I got home I checked out good old Trade Me and there it was with even more photos! Straight away I emailed my family the link and thought how they would get a chuckle out of it too.

Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle was arguably the most popular comedian working at Keystone during the time that Chaplin was with the studio. An incredibly gifted comic performer and director, Arbuckle had a unique style that he developed within the roughhouse environment of Keystone. Unlike many of the interchangeable grotesques, Arbuckle took advantage of his size to project a boyish charm that belied his imposing physique. For example, in his introductory shot in THE KNOCKOUT, he emerges from a bakery carrying his dog, and the two share a doughnut. This imagery – pairing the comic with an animal sidekick - would later be used by Chaplin to establish audience sympathy in THE CHAMPION (in which he attempts to share a sausage with a dog), and in A DOG’S LIFE, which features a number of such scenes. It also helps, perhaps quite literally, to establish the clown as “underdog”.

The streams were either “forded” or crossed by means of ferries owned by private individuals. Fares for ferries were fixed in each county in those days by the Inferior Court. In times of high water the streams which were “forded” would often “swim” the horse and vehicle for two or three days and at times even longer, and only those on horse-back could have any reasonable hope of making a trip without interruptions. There were no bridges on any of the streams until after the Civil War.

But what about that moment, when the baby animal climbs out of the birth canal and the umbilical cord is severed, or the tiny animal comes out of the shell it has cracked? Isn’t that the quickest change of all. Changing from a dependency on the link to all that is needed to a dependence on what the body can obtain for itself.
The answer, of course, was no. No, it is not ok to be blindly and innocently blundering through life with a good intention and a hug for people who need one…Then Pollyanna starts talking and she tells me that I am serving a good purpose while doing good and intending to do good. So I shouldn’t be so hard on myself. Also, I figured out that my card was blocked before the bank called me to say that they thought it was in the hands of a mad woman, didn’t I? I’m not that blunderful, right?

I am not financing education entirely through student loan debt. I held work study jobs as an undergraduate, and have usually held some kind of on-campus employment. I have been a TA for the university for the last seven years. The fact is, government support of higher education is down and the cost of tuition has outpaced salaries to such a great degree in this country that virtually nobody is able to afford an education on their own wages without taking on a substantial burden of student loan debt. The vast majority of the anecdotes to the contrary concern degrees earned twenty or thirty years ago, before major structural changes in the financing of higher education – in the post-war years, government funding allowed the vast majority of expense for education to be met through Pell grants and scholarships, making it possible for many people to work themselves through school. That hasn’t been possible for most people in most degree programs for at least thirty years, and these nostalgic memories of an entirely different time and set of circumstances are not doing the debate on higher education financing in this country any good at all.
Observers at the JSDF base watch their radar screens in horror as Maki’s jet collides with the UFO. A search party sets out immediately to recover the wreckage from a remote mountainous region of Japan. To their astonishment they find Maki not only alive, but virtually unhurt. Yet there is no evidence as to how he might have survived, not even a parachute to indicate he ejected before the crash. Maki himself has no memory of anything after he lost consciousness aboard his plane.

ACHERON, if judged on mere stamina and surving the ages, earns the title of legendary, and is pivotal to the Glorious Times musically and on a personal level for the editors. You'd be hard pressed to find many musicians to continue striving forward despite all obstacles, to keep the will to creativity alive. On the other side of the coin then, rarely has an extreme music style mirrored the philosophical development of it's core membership.
Also, whether or not Revelation demonstrates someone speaking in the third person is hardly the issue. It is a literary device that is found elsewhere in the Bible and therefore has precedence. Again, we have the examples of Jesus doing so.

Looking over NBCs drama development, I think they need to go after shows that are unique and ones that stand out from all that is on the air currently. Bad Girls has a really diverse cast and a premise (women in prison) unlike any on TV. John Wells producing doesn’t hurt and it feels like this could be the kind of show that would bring new viewers to NBC. It might make a good Mon 10p option.

I can honestly say from my vantage point now, that paperboy job was the best job I ever had in my life. The best. I was on my own, I was out in the fresh air, I got to meet and interact with people (which I love and do to this day as I do at my part-time job as a hotel front desk clerk), and I made money. If there was any downside at all (and I didn’t and never did consider it a downside) was that I didn’t have time for extra-circular activities at school. While the rest of my classmates were spending their allowances and getting into trouble or just being bored, I had something to do after school, deliver papers. And oh the experiences I had delivering those newspapers, something which I will write about in future blogs.

The comparison between Schleigh and Barnes is somewhat simpler than comparing Barnes to LaGarde, since both players are the same height (6-6) and played against the same opponents. Schleigh shot somewhat less often than Barnes (23.8% of shots to 26.4%), but made an impressive 62.5% of his twos and even more impressive 46.0% of his also-frequent threes. This gives him an effective field goal percentage of 0.652 against Barnes’ 0.511 mark, and when combined with his free-throw shooting Schleigh owns a 0.672-0.540 advantage in true shooting percentage. This means that while Barnes shot a little more often, Schleigh shot significantly better.
At the same time, I was working my way through the shelves of our local library. Thanks to my only having a children's library ticket, this meant I only had access to the children's section and only two books at a time, which meant I was slowly but steadily working my way through the works of Enid Blyton, Capt. W. E. Johns, Anthony Buckeridge and Malcolm Saville. And American authors like Wilbur Price, Franklin W. Dixon, Carolyn Keene and multi-author series like the Three Investigators books, introduced by Alfred Hitchcock.

How did Rio achieve their reduced recoil goal? Quite simply by taming down the load and cutting velocity back by 150fps or so. Once again... will that 150fps matter at 25 yards? Perhaps more important might be the quicker follow up shot, and better control. A cloud of nine OO pellets fired from any shotgun at any significant velocity is a fearsome thing to face from the downrange side, but with the reduced recoil shells it need be a little less scary from the shooters perspective as well.
Before I head out, I want to do this quick post on a dress that has caught my fancy. It was a late January evening. I was leaving for the vine ‘yard sale’ in a couple of days and hadn’t found the dress I was looking for. I wasn’t going without but my determination was withering. I had scouted all the possible malls when Aniruddha suggested we drive past Lokhandwala. Perhaps, some boutique might be open. And Golmaal came to my rescue.
So now as I take photos to preserve our family's memories I think in terms of composite memory photos. Not just photos of the family at special times but photos that capture the everyday joys as well. I find myself photographing objects that bring laughter and happiness to my family as well as the photos of the family members. Often I am thinking how a photograph could be used as a background for a memory composite or in conjunction with other photos to capture the memory. Here is one memory photo created using one of the Sponge Bob play set photographs.

SA: In large part because our entire culture (and economy) is predicated on keeping all citizens in a state of insecurity and overstimulation and exhaustion. Also because the political system is fueled by special interest money, folks who are paid, in essence, to make sure a genuine morality doesn't intrude on the business of the government. We saw a brilliant example in the extension of the Bush tax cuts. That was about greed, pure and simple, and virtually nobody would say that. The Fourth Estate, which also runs on a for-profit model, is in the business of making money, not serving as the peoples' representative in Washington. I think most Americans see "politics" as some kind of absurd sport played on cable TV. It's become unmoored from issues of morality. And, like I say, most parents simply want to get through the day however they can. Amid the inconvenience of children, they don't want the further inconvenience of having to consider themselves moral actors.

Coming soon to a theater near you -- Friday, November 4th to be exact -- is the all-star comedy caper Tower Heist (Universal). Starring Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, Michael Pena, Casey Affleck, and Eddie Murphy (as seen above), the story is straight out of the today's headlines. Alan Alda plays billionaire Arthur Shaw who swindles his investors out of their retirement (shades of Bernie Madoff) and most regrettably for him, the people that work in his swanky Columbus Circle luxury condo (again, as seen above). Stiller and his co-workers hire petty thief Eddie Murphy to steal some of Shaw's prize possessions -- the crown jewel being Steve McQueen's red 1963 Ferrari. Hence the name Tower Heist.

Such an approach would understand that the family, in its diverse forms and shapes, is the building block of society and that we all lose if we don’t find ways to help the family help its members, especially as Canada’s population ages. Such an approach would understand that parents are and must be responsible for raising their children and parental choice is crucial in a society as diverse as ours but also that choice is impossible for most of us absent key public infrastructure and that the best of families need help from time to time. This approach would understand that crime must be punished justly, that justice should be restorative but that we should not allow fear or anger to blind us to proportionality and to what works to make us safer. This approach would understand that pro-choice goes hand in hand with family planning and personal responsibility. And at its foundation it would understand that human dignity requires a commitment to both liberty and equality and that liberty can only truly be experienced within a healthy political community and society, that self and other, individual and community are inseparable. Such an approach would put human dignity at the centre because dignity itself is a social idea that draws its strength from the twin values of liberty and the inherent equality of all people.

Meditation. One of the ways that God has provided for our joy is contingent upon our willingness to take time to meditate on His Word. Why?

ULTRAMAN debuts on US television. United Artists snapped up the syndication rights to the show even before it had finished its Japanese network run. Ultraman continued to play in syndication in America until the mid-1980’s!
Since our girls first went off to college we have spent some time moving them in and out of apartments, with each move we have had to get a larger van/truck because their belongings have grown. One particular move for DD1, involved moving her from a shared apartment to a room at her grandma's house before she started law school. This move also involved us storing some of her belongings for her. Mr Bankerchick was younger then and still working in the auto industry, so he borrowed a stake bed truck from work and we were able in one LONG day, to move all of her things from Santa Barbara to the LA area where grandma lived, unload and drive back to our house to unload the items for storage, so we could get the truck back to the Company the next day. We were both exhausted.
In this series, each post will focus on one main dish. I sometimes like to make extras just so that I have the leftovers ready to be re-invented into another great dish. So ask yourself this:
Bobbie and Ashley have just returned from their trip – and what they found was absolutely appalling. Tell your friends about this site and encourage them to sign up. Comment on our photos – everything you do to make people more aware helps.
A lot of artists have begun to make use of fan funding sites to sustain themselves. What do you think of this method? Do you think fan funding could ever replace the traditional, top-down record label method ofdistribution?
6. I don't do high fantasy. Here there be no dragons.
The narrative bowls along at a good pace, the descriptions are wonderful, as is the characterisation. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, and would encourage anyone to buy it.

Hoveringdog suggested saving the seeds and see if I could grow more tomatoes with horns next year. I had to give one of the tomatoes back with the plant, but I have the seeds from one of them. You might see another post like this next MoFo.

Most babies seem to love banana, and Jacob did, although he’s become a little more banana-averse as a toddler. Two cons are that they’re messy in tiny hands and they can also be constipating; I find half a medium banana a day is about Jacob’s limit.
These exercises are not incredibly difficult. The goal — if you want to quantify it, is to show, after the challenge is complete, that you increased your numbers. I’m sure you could also say that you’d like to drop a pant size or two, or maybe lose 5-10 lbs. I’m going to focus on the number of reps and how I feel as opposed to weight loss, because I think that just comes naturally when you’re active and eating healthy.

In our run so far, there’s only one thing I love more than the relationships we’ve built – watching our audience react to them.

It is my duty to raise and foster children who do not perpetuate the stereotypes that plague our society; in particular I am looking to dispel black myths–Black men are dogs. They are irresponsible. They don’t take care of their children. They have 3 kids, by 5 baby mamas. All they care about is spending money on the newest released Jordan’s. That because they are walking down the street wearing a hoodie, they are somehow suspicious. We are not a monolithic group of people that can be described in 1 simple sentence paragraph. We are so much more than what we are portrayed to be, but sadly even within our own community we ascribe to and believe in these very same stereotypes and generalizations. Because as we all know “niggas aint shit!”
When one fears something, one doesn’t understand it, lacks information on it, or one wishes to feel superior to it, one identifies observable characteristics of a few representatives (e.g of a group) and apply them to the whole. It makes everyone in the group seem less threatening or overwhelming and makes the person using the stereotype feel more comfortable and powerful. It is often racist, but it can be sexist, ageist or applied to people with specific political and religious labels like Liberals, Conservatives, Catholics, Muslims etc.
Thomas Jefferson to Lafayette, 1823.
The psychotic diversity enforcers at Amerika's newspaper of record are hell-bent on equalizing society no matter what. They are the ultimate Pol Pot communists of this sick world. Make no mistake, their ideology is so extreme, that if they could (commit violence in furtherance of their utopian agenda) they would.
The shows at The Lake are unique and may come as close to the original blues dance environment of late night house parties or after-hours held all over London. If you've never been, The Lake is a second floor loft space a few blocks from the subway, amidst several lonely (at least at night) blocks of warehouses and industrial shops--if you didn't know which metal door to open and stairs to climb, you'd probably never find this place (or suspect what the hell was going on inside!). My blogging pal Duff Guide To Ska sums up a show at The Lake quite nicely:
I needed a birthday car for Zavian's 2nd birthday and was inspired by a card that I saw on Marcella's blog, here. I liked the bright, happy colors and the use of white twine. I decorated the envelope with a popped up kite since this card was being hand delivered. I didn't realize until we were getting ready to leave for the party that my kites don't have strings, just tails. These are apparently runaway kites. Oh well, I'll get that right next time.

When we investigate Islamic law as it is informed by the Koran and the Sunna, the call for “reform” in Mr. Ramadan’s conclusion makes complete sense:
he looked up just then and caught me watching.
He spoke on Hard work and what it meant to him.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg just gave $50 million to the Sierra Club to support its “Beyond Coal” campaign. Bloomberg actually thinks it’s a good thing the Sierra Club has managed to stop 150 coal-burning plants from being built. Meanwhile, during the current heat wave, providers of electricity are worrying whether they can continue to meet the increased demand for it. Coal provides 50% of all the electricity we use in America.

There are a few sayings I’ve come across in my blog research (herein referred to as “Bsearch”…kidding). They all follow the same theme, and that is that, “clicks are the currency of the internet.” Well, if clicks are the currency, subscribers are the gold. Ever notice have every site you go to has some type of sign up? I have one, its to the right, it says “Follow the madness.” I recently moved it to the top of my widget list because the recent posts and comments were bumping it so far to the bottom I doubt anyone saw it. Also, I moved it in hopes that YOU would subscribe to me. In doing so, you will be informed when I post new posts and will make me feel all warm deep down inside.
modern times Revelation was identified in fact with the objective and fixed set of the contents of Holy Writ was foreign to Bonaventure’s thinking. Additionally, in his analysis, Ratzinger pointed out that in this perspective there is Revelation only if the act wherewith the Mystery reveals itself is perceived by someone. If God had spoken only in a divine language, not
And the fans understand that this competition is not fair. And because of this, one team’s expectations for a season are completely different to the next, even at the very top of the table. Put it this way – if Man City fail to win the league this season then they should be ridiculed. All that money spent, and all the times they undermined and mocked their direct opponents over the last four years – anything less than first place would be a huge failure.

Unfortunately, I am back from my mini-vacation, not that I didn’t miss you guys – because I did! But, I think most will agree that it is no fun to leave the beach, relaxing and perfect weather for alarm clocks and morning traffic.
Some homebrewers are concerned about their water useage. Brewing requires a fair amount of water, not only to mash and rinse the grains but also to chill the boiling wort before you add the yeast. Again, here on our farm I don't really waste anything. I use the very hot water that first comes out of the wort chiller to clean my equipment. Then, when it starts to cool off, I capture it in 5 gallon buckets and use it to fill the water troughs for the animals.
I have been mulling over this post for a long time now and one thing I was wondering about was how to present the information I’ve gathered over the last few months. I eventually decided to split this into a series of posts, with this being the first part. It has certainly helped that Obari joined twitter last summer, as many of his tweets have shown a great insight into his career and many of the shows he has worked on.
I shook my head. "Nowhere. Nowhere I've ever been. My experience with cities is restricted to airports, but I've seen pictures that were something like this."

So, I went back later & took photos of some of the places that we went on our first few dates.

In time we all moved to Missouri with our company. After a while there Jay took a job with another company and they moved away. We too left and moved back to South Dakota to work for my father-in-law. That was not a good fit and in a couple of years we were again looking for work when Jay called and asked if we would consider moving to Tennessee to consult for the company he worked for there, so we were off on another adventure.
But I felt guilty - maybe I should keep him home for the day. Or bring him with me, downtown. He loves taking the train, but his whole routine gets disrupted and he probably won't have a great day. And I start thinking that if I wasn't a working mom, I wouldn't have to think about this, not have to fret about the one crazy person who takes things too far, today or any other day, just because it's a Jewish institution, just because I have to go to work. And my conversations with other descendants of the Holocaust start ringing in my ears, that we can never forget, because it can still happen now.
What I’m going to say next might sound arrogant, but I promise it isn’t: I don’t write for anyone else, I write for me. Why isn’t that arrogant? Because I believe that precisely the reverse is true – the arrogant thing would be for me, a 44 year old to assume that I know what a modern British 14 year old boy wants to read, or how an Australian 12 year girl thinks, or a German teen or a Brazilian or… You get the point. How could I possibly know those things? And this is really part of a much broader point – whenever anyone writes anything at all, teen, adult, horror, romance, sci-fi, they should be writing it for themselves, because to assume that any of us know what is desired in another’s head is an act of extreme arrogance.
She could only lie there.
The one thing we desire the most is the one thing that we don't know if we'll ever have, because of me.
I scratched my neck and reflected. “Wouldn’t it be simpler just to warn everyone that a practical joker is distributing bogus love letters?” I ventured.
The “magic” happened when we used an add-a-quarter ruler to the edge of each sewn piece to cut off the excess. Instead of getting globs of fabric lumps on the back, each seam was nice and tidy. It made lining up the next piece super simple!

Here are some examples. (And if you're offended by profanity, please look away now. I apologise for what's to come. But I didn't paint them. Although for the prices he gets for them, I wish I did!)
First, let's take a look at what's wrong with all our politicians. The answer here is simple. They are all ideologues. Not one of them has any practical new ideas about fixing the mess we're in other than "spend less money" or "spend more money" or "God wants us to do this or that."

This wasn't just three boxes. It was like 10. And each box had four rows of cards. At first I didn't think I'd find much because I saw a whole bunch of football, basketball, hockey and even auto racing. I don't care about that stuff. But a little rummaging around yielded some baseball with little problem. And the more I looked, the more baseball I found. And the more baseball I found, the more interesting it became. And the more interesting it became, the more cards I found that I wanted. And the more cards I found that I wanted, the larger the pile grew. And the larger the pile grew, the more problems I had with the stack spilling over.
My character has flaws. What do we, as readers, hate above all else? MARY SUES! Of course we want to route for the good guys, we want them to win, but we also want to relate to them. We don’t want perfect characters that are chiseled by the god’s own breath into the perfectly black and white moralistic character that can kill at the blink of an eye. We need characters with flaws, and not just your petty little “Oh I have daddy issue” flaws, we need realistic flaws, we need contradictions! We need the character that is so involved in his philanthropic ways and supporting his “charity” but doesn’t see the homeless man with the broken leg and a small child on the side of the street. We want characters that are so flawed that we’re not actually sure how we feel about them, we want to like them, we want to cheer for them, but they’re hurting so much and it reminds us of something all too dark about ourselves… NOW THAT’S A CHARACTER!

These authors take an architectural approach to writing. Before they begin writing, they plan the structure, how the finished product will look. They build their characters from the ground up, with character profiles, case histories and spider diagrams showing how they link to each other. If you’re a logical type who likes systems, this approach will give you the security and concept to begin telling your story.

The Boys Varsity Tennis Team began WSC action last night with a win over the Bay Village Rockets. Winning for the Sailors were #1 single Chaz Hansen, 3rd singles Kevin Cole, and the second doubles team of Tim Neihart and Eddie Adkins. This win raises the team records to 2-0 overall and 1-0 in West Shore Conference play. The boys will play the Warriors of Fairview Thursday at home.
2) Learn how to identify quality: Amy says that “an ignorant shopper will spend more money,” so getting to know the feel of quality materials and looking for well-constructed clothing is a great money-saving skill. She recommends starting at the thrift stores, where you will find quality cashmere and silk, as well as less-desirable rayon and acrylic. You can feel the difference in the materials and will be more discerning when deciding what to purchase. Amy says she wore a black dress (that she purchased at a thrift store) inside out, on more than one occasion, because the quality was so high that she couldn’t tell which was the right way to wear it. She paid $5 for that dress.
I quickly realize I'd rather be sitting here with some scrambled eggs on toast.
Case 2. As I was watching CNN at the gym, Josh Levs was doing a segment about using social media to find missing children. He showed this Facebook fan page called Missing Children, Let's find Them. Imagine an entire city being alerted to a missing child via radio, television, news articles, Facebook, and Twitter. Finding missing kids would be so much faster and more efficient. If you know anything about missing children, the length of time they've been missing is highly correlated to the likelihood that the child is no longer alive. Time is critical in these cases. This is only one way that social media can be beneficial to society.

alongside this girl who was cycling alone and slowed down to her pace (which in fact wasn’t very slow). She was wearing a uniform and lots of jewellery that looked like gold, earrings and chain and stuff. Namaskara, i smiled, and to my great relief she responded in kind. Yellige hogtira? Where you going? She named the next village, about 8k away, who’s name too I forget, and which is too small to show up on Google maps. To school. We cycled alongside for a bit and she told me she was in class 8, while I told her about my trip. It is half-forgotten encounters like these that I cherish most from the trip.
We are going to have moments when we think everything is completely out of control, when we get totally overwhelmed by our circumstances and forget that God has a perfect plan. The storm seems so dark and powerful that it blots out the face of God. It’s so easy to forget that we can trust His heart.

You are probably thinking that I am a complete freak and I should just let my kid be a kid and stop putting so much effort into this, right? Well, I am proud to say that since we have started this, she has not had one single accident (day or night). She has only gotten an X on her calendar twice and has gotten a star on every day besides those two and you can also see how much happier she is. She does not throw fits, she listens so much better, she plays so much nicer with other kids, she is constantly giving us kisses and hugs instead of getting frustrated with us...the list goes on and on. I am so excited!

For example, sometimes girls have to work shucking in the corn fields all day, and sometimes they’re alone with older men who approach them and make sexual offers. As there is no one who can see or hear them, the girl is on her own on how to respond. She might suffer a lot more refusing, maybe be beaten and then forced to have sex. But to avoid this field work is also to face starvation. The ways girls talk about these stories are hardly straightforward.
For three days in April, I was a guest author at the MASC (Multicultural Arts for Schools and Communities) Young Authors and Young Illustrators Conference in Ottawa. I led six groups of talented writers aged 9-14 in developing characters and plots and bringing them to life through well chosen words. It was so inspiring! All those bright young heads bent toward their desks, all those pencils scratching the paper.
I've always wanted to experiment with painting one of my baskets. I thought about doing a big stripe, but decided on doing an ombre wash with some white latex paint I had. I think I would avoid using a glossy paint on this project - I used eggshell finish here.

I have difficulty knowing when something that I am experiencing is something that I should tell the Dr. and when it is something insignificant because I still don't know too much about myself apart from the symptoms.... it's hard to explain. I'm afraid that I'm not quite sure what normal is.

UMNO is loud in its proclamation that it is a devout adherent to the fundamental tenets of Islam and it is its guardian. UMNO brooks no interference from any quarters. Perkasa headed by the maverick Ibrahim Ali and together with Hasan Ali, the expelled Selangor state leader of PAS (and now leader of JATI) are being perceivedas the unofficial storm-troopers of UMNO. They have been very strident in pointing out the sins of almost everyone save their Muslim members and that of UMNO, but they cannot and or refuse to see the sins within their own organisations.
My grandparents served during World War II. He either liberated Auschwitz, or served in the Navy, or was declared 4F; she posed for that Rosie the Riveter poster. I got my biceps from my grandmother. They believed in an America where hard work paid off, and responsibility was rewarded, and anyone could make it if they tried. I got my moral compass from Rod Blagojevich.
“In the early 1980′s, EPA and state investigations of this area revealed that the groundwater, soil and surface water were heavily contaminated with explosive nitroaromatic compounds including TNT, trinitrobenzene, and dinitrotoluene, as well as arsenic, lead, beryllium and asbestos. The site was placed on the EPA’s National Priorities List in 1983 and extensive cleanup efforts began in 1991. While a portion of the original facility has been remediated, many of the toxic and explosive contaminants were simply buried on site.

So I offered - well I begged - to do my cover design myself. I think there are elements of the story I know so well that come together, that invite the viewer with a few strong codes, or I truly hope so. I have been studying ladylit covers for so long now I am saturated and decided to veer far away from pastels, curly writing, heels and flutes of champagne. Instead I think I have made something that is more intriguing, and throws out a cheeky lure.
