When the Coffins moved again in 1809, this time to Philadelphia. James Mott, a fellow teacher at Nine Partners, settled there too, taking a position in Thomas Coffin’s hardware business. On Apr. 10, 1811, he & Lucretia were married in the Pine Street Meetinghouse. They made a striking couple: he a tall, blond, kindly appearing man, dignified in demeanor & deliberate in speech; she a diminutive brunette with a high, broad forehead, intense, burning eyes, a vivacious manner, & a tart tongue (her schoolmates on Nantucket had caller her a “spitfire,” & that irrepressible trait still occasionally broke through the Quaker sweetness & serenity with which in later life it was overlaid). Despite differences in temperament, however, a complete harmony of interest subsisted between them throughout the 57 years of their married life. James Mott shared all his wife’s convictions, supported her in all her unpopular causes, &, by accompanying her on speaking tours, lent he public appearances a respectability which other feminist lectures lacked. Six children were born to them between 1812 - 1828: Anna, Thomas (who died in infancy), Maria, a second Thomas, Elizabeth, & Martha.
Last year I wrote a piece which suggested, among other things, that Joseph Heller is famous for the wrong book; that Catch-22, while good, is not a patch on his second novel, Something Happened. It attracted many comments, mostly calling me an idiot. I was “mental”, “wrong wrong wrong,” talking “utter tosh,” “showing off”, and simultaneously guilty of “critical cliché” and being “lazily contrarian” (which is a good trick if you can do it). I can’t say that any of these insults made me question my judgement – it’s mine, right? – but I did wonder if the book would hold up after all these years. How many was it again?

With both engine manufacturers having long established overrun strategies that have critical impacts on the basic engine design or the braking system, it will be hard to rapidly switch to a very strict overrun mapping as demanded by the 10% rule. Both manufacturers lobbied the FIA to be allowed to retain elements of these old overrun strategies, while still emasculating their current strategies. The FIA have been able to see the mappings used in 2009 through to the current day, as the code is held by the FIA since the advent of the single ECU (SECU). They’ve been able to see the engines have had these long established mappings, but also how they have become more aggressive since the EBD has been developed.
“Oh yeah, that bastard.” She laid the mirror on the bed, and then purposely stood in a position that put her lady lumps right in my face. I had no choice but to look. Her boobs were her only redeeming quality.

And as we aged, his handsome self grew more distinguished. He’d long since cut his hair and shaved his face when I saw him last, the frosty flecks of gray in his hair was bold and sexy.

In the light and (relative) warmth of the morning (not to mention going down hill) the 3.7 miles didn't seem nearly as bad as they had coming up, so the boys were all in good spirits. We passed Fern Branch Falls - a nice tall cascade down a flat rock face just uphill of the trail. While you can't see it in the picture below, there were rows of icicles hanging from the rock faces that flank the falls.
Helen Steiner Rice puts it this way:
She asked me if I was looking forward to Seattle and I gave her a terse, one-word response, though all I really wanted to do was tell her exactly how excited I was for everything I have planned. I think she would have been excited, too. Not that it matters anyways.

Yesterday I watched three people be baptized into the Catholic Church, and two more make their profession of Faith before all five were confirmed, thus completing their full initiation. They were young and by all observation “normal” people. They decided on their own to join the Church. It’s hard not to think “really? us?”
“Ah, you know,” the zealot tilts his head to one side, “They come; they go – business is brisk.”
According to all the standard claims of TT, this should have been easy. They should have been able to feel the energy from her body radiating outwards, if it was really present and “tactile as taffy“, as these things apparently usually are. But when they didn’t know what they were supposed to be feeling, the effect vanished. In this blinded experiment, the group of practitioners made 123 correct predictions out of 280 attempts between them. That’s slightly crappier than the most likely result of pure guesswork.
For Daniel Alvi, it’s another sign, since February’s demolition of the three-storey compound where bin Laden saw out his final days, that things are returning to normal. “It was really funny, people were laughing about it,” he told The Australian this week. “People try to come all the time. Whenever foreigners come here, the police immediately arrest them.”

As for Low, it's a source of delight just to see them back on stage together. Little has been heard of them since 2007's Drums And Guns - a difficult album by their standards, a departure from the norm and hailed in some quarters as their Kid A. Bassist Matt Livingston, himself a replacement for long-time member Zak Sally, has been replaced by Steve Garrington, and Sparhawk, recovering from the period of mental instability which led Sally to quit, has been occupying himself with side-project the Retribution Gospel Choir.
Finally, remember: When we return to our real home, it will be with the “mutual approbation” of those who reign in the “royal courts on high.” There we will find beauty such as mortal “eye hath not seen”; we will hear sounds of surpassing music which mortal “ear hath not heard.” Could such a regal homecoming be possible without the anticipatory arrangements of a Heavenly Mother?

You need a book to tell you this? I remember being a teenager. It was like someone injected an overdose of hormones into my veins and left me to fend for myself in the desert without any water. It was awful. Of course I didn't know how to communicate my feelings. There were far too many of them happening at one time for even me to know what they were. Plus, at this age you are trying to learn how to think rationally and communicate reasonably. While dealing with a Sasquatch of emotional clusterfuck.

I can't wait to do some more fun stuff on this wall. My boss actually pointed me to this super cool artist in Brooklyn, NY that does chalk designs from a WSJ article he came across.. Her name is Dana Tanamachi and here's some of her chalk designs. I am quite sure that I'm going to have more fun with this than Ruby right now. She made a few lines on the chalkboard the next morning but was quickly asking for a pen so I gave her some paper to draw on. I asked her if she like the chalkboard and she said "No this!" holding the pen and pointing at the paper. :)

The creatures had no name for themselves, but a lot of names for the creatures who lived between blue and purple, with whom they were engaged in constant animosity. Both races were too timid for fisticuffs, but they would sneer at each other and thumb their noses when they met – and, after a couple of drinks, would hurl socks across the spectrum into their enemy’s hue.

Then there is the great lie that multiculturalism enriches our culture, whereas, in fact we have been impoverished by it. It has brought intolerance, it has brought fear and division, it has brought violence, abuse and and it has brought ugliness. It has fragmented communities, broken down families, forced us to accept politically correct lies as the new reality, it has taken away our faith, our pride, and for many it has taken away the love our forefathers once felt for this country.
Initially taking on the role of manager for his friend Dick Long's contrived band, The Niggers, Jerry's duties included rallying up musicians and finding them a rehearsal space. It soon became apparent that Dick wasn't actually up for being a front man, so Jerry hopped on board. He continued playing with the group for a few months after that, but since they had no original material to work on, he decided to get a new band started.

Finally Shirley is able to stab him to death (or at least leave a prop knife hanging off his belt, according to the looks of this), then makes it to the bathroom as two cops arrive on the scene. ...uh, how did they know to come here?

In the country in which I live, we are in the midst of a presidential election campaign. The months between now and the first Tuesday in November lie before us like a yawning abyss. One thing can be stated with absolute certainty and without fear of contradiction: the media will put on a display of “mad agility in compound deceit.” (One of my favorite phrases from Saul Bellow. (It is from Mr. Sammler’s Planet.) Ten syllables in what may be iambic pentameter. It sounds like something by Shakespeare or Donne. Bellow could have been a poet.)

2) A new sink strainer. Due to the fact that we don't have a dishwasher and do all our dishes by hand, a sink strainer is a necessity for us. A separate one from the one in the drain, I mean. When you have to pour a huge pan of really dirty water out into the sink, you have to strain it before it gets to the drain thing, or else that will just clog up and the water won't drain out of the sink. For years, a small plastic handled colander in the sink served this purpose. It got pretty gross, though, and while I was in Arizona in March, the MiL chucked it. In its place, she got a small stainless steel colander at the grocery store.

Beltane, for those of you who don’t know, is a pagan holiday of fertility. Now, for the record, the actual interpretation of this is quite literal, but I like to think that it is fertility of many things: ideas, businesses, new ventures, anything you wish to grow. It is about beginnings.

They had met the night before I met him, but he lost her number. They had shared a kiss then. I remember this story because she was so upset that this mysteriously perfect man did not call her back after an amazing connection. I remember joking that any connection with saliva was good. I wonder how she managed to hide her shock when I introduced him to her for the first time when we started dating, just a week after we met. I asked him to stop talking then. I did not want to know how it started, or rather, continued. He insisted on continuing. I let him. After all, he was actually putting his foot down for once, which he never done even if I begged him to.
Ideal Mexico, a chance but fitting title taken from the model name of the old central heating boilers in the gallery building, invites us to question the relationship between reality, desire, and experience; challenging the superficiality and formality of our insatiable appetite for images depicting and describing how our lives could be in an ideal world.

Apologies to all those who aren't keen on Miss Tilda, but I seem to be a bit addicted at the moment! This stamp has actually been used... but only once just after I bought her. I've coloured her with promarkers and flexmarkers, with prisma pencils for the shadow underneath her. The papers are from an old K&Co pad. The card base is cream - for once it's not just a dodgy photo lol.

The Phillies are Sag's second favorite baseball team and he had hoped to go to a game while we were in Philly. I don't really pay attention to sports unless it pertains to Red Sox, Celtics or Patriots, and even then, my attention is fickle. So, I was surprised and dismayed when Phillies tickets, this early in the season, versus the Mets for heaven's sake, were impossible to get through the team's website.
With the game over I got the usual question from the photographers, “How was that?” After Hamburg I said with a smile: “They did their job”, but after these two games all I could say was “Wow!!!”

The doctor then prescribed a cat scan, and I was also called for in for that this week, which made three medical appointments in one week after so much waiting. Like the doctor appointment, the scan took place out of town, so it's been a busy week or driving and medical appointments. My main disappointment was in not having an actual pussy cat do the scanning. What a letdown.

We are very lucky in this day and age where we can call or even text people. Sometimes a daily text session with a family member can really help give you that awareness of what is going on in their life and make you feel as if you are not so far away. Also, many argue that your family knows you best; they are there for you as listeners, advice givers and comforters.
I like Steve's character. He's the kind of father you'll want to have. And if you're a guy, he's someone you want to be if you grow up. He's understanding, kind, gentle person.

There’s a hill at the 4th Street bridge, just west of Boyle Ave., and a few other places. If you have a bike with gears and you aren’t used to riding up hills, remember to shift down just before the hill. If you try to shift gears while going up the hill, you might cause the chain to come off (“throw the chain”). Shift to a gear that feels like it might be too easy. Most likely it will feel just right once you are going up. If your bike doesn’t have gears and you can’t ride up the hill, move towards the ride side of the road to dismount and walk your bike. If the slower folks are on the right, it helps to maintain the flow and avoid bumps and falls. The folks riding up the hill will appreciate it if the uphill path is clear.

The report identified a total of 1,217 suspects, however, in the case of a significant number of those (464) the ethnicity of the perpetrator is recorded as "unknown", therefore they can not be included in any meaningful assessment of the composition of offenders. Every media outlet had attempted to pretend that those of "unknown race" must all be white, but the figures do not support that assumption.

I really noticed my own “whoosh” when I was going through a divorce a few years ago. It was a difficult process because my ex was angry at me for leaving. His emails negotiating terms often had a bitter and sarcastic edge. I would see his name in my in-box and WHOOSH, a flush through my chest, my face would get hot and I’d feel butterflies (no, something bigger, maybe gila monsters) in my stomach. I’d read the email and I’d have an immediate nasty response. Or I’d want to run away all together.
That's an awful lot of time spent doing the same thing.
The fountain of Youth is in Luckenbach, Texas. No one probably noticed but I have been absent a day or two. I took a couple of days off from the office while The Boss and I took a short vacation to Fredricksburg, Texas. Six million, eight thousand, three hundred and six , (that is where I stopped counting), motorcycles decided to do the same thing. On Saturday, on our way back home, we “cut through” to stop in on Luckenbach, Texas. The motor cycle riders decided to do that too. Most of you know I am a frustrated wanna be git-tar picker and If you had a radio and only listened to one country song, around ’78-’80,you have heard , “Let’s go to Luckenback, Texas, with Willie Waylon and the Boys”. Sooo, that is what I did.

John 6:31-32 "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, 'He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.'"

As a silly, tortured adolescent – a gaping vacuum of neediness and a spouting fountain of noise, my only goal in life was to mature. I didn’t dream of wealth or love. What I wanted was inner peace, charm, and calm. I wanted to know when to shut up, and to be able to do so. I wanted to be liked because I was helpful and supportive, and I wanted to not need admiration or attention.

The Cable Guy – I did see this when it came out and I hated it, but that might just be because I don’t like Jim Carey! lol anyway it makes a change for the character to be male, but other than that it is again freakily scary behaviour that is the main focus, and again in my opinion the character is suffering so much more than BPD!

If you aren’t familiar with the green flash, it’s a phenomena that can be viewed on an unobstructed horizon, usually just before sunrise, or just after sunset. There are several causes for this phenomena, but in short it has to due with the way light is refracted in the atmosphere, as the sun sets.

On the inside of the door, I lined the edges with some satin ribbon and then added a little text. I named this woman "Our Lady Of The Reapers." Here is what it looks like:
For her it's love, invasive, invading, obsessive, overwhelming and distracting. He's beautiful. Young, gorgeous skin, luscious hair and an infectious smile. She doesn't know why he loves her but he does, he has a faith in her that no other has displayed and gives her confidence and buoys her self-esteem. Unlike her former employer.
I guess what it comes down to is that I just can’t fucking trust him and that really hurts. I give this man everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, he asks for and a lot of things he doesn’t ask for. I don’t know what more I could do for him.

Its a sunny mothers day and we’re off further into the lakes to Hawkshead for a nice meal and follow it up with a run-around at grizedale forest. We thought we would park and walk in. We found ourselves heading back toward a pub which we had had a tasty meal at a few years ago after work, Queens Head, which is in the middle of Hawkshead.

Working through my moods, my ups and downs, is a frequent challenge. When I’m “up” life is good, nothing is bad and my glasses are rose colored. If I’m “down” then all I can see around me are the things in life that could be better. I’m seldom in such a poor state where everything is bad or I think my life sucks the big one but my energy is depleted and the things around me I should be enjoying are somehow greyed out, out of focus and difficult to see.

I know I've lost 20lbs but clothes shopping will not be in the least bit pleasurable until I've lost another 2 stone. This I am certain of and even then it will be a size 14. I need to crank it up a notch big time. It is March tomorrow - time is marching (no pun intended) on. I need to look different from last year. I just have to.
We will no longer accept a doctor's statement as proof of illness. If you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to go to work.
Yesterday wasn't a great food day. Not horrible, just not great. I ate out for lunch and shouldn't have. I had my appointment with Dr. G and Kailee and I decided to meet Dail for lunch. I had some cheese curds and some onion rings. I know fried and greasy. The rest of the day wasn't as bad. Today is going okay too. Dinner will be pork chops with broccoli and probably mac and cheese for the family. It is difficult to stay on liquids all the time but I'm trying to do it as much as possible. The scale has stopped and isn't going up. I've been ashamed to post my weight because I can't believe I let it get so far out of hand but today I am at 203. You can understand why I have been so upset. I finally feel though that I am snapping out of it and can control my eating better. There is no junk in the house other than some Atkins bars. I try not to do those often either but they do have some protein and don't set of my carb cravings when I want something sweet. I think it is absolutely possible for me to get back to where I was but it is going to take some hard work. I battle the head hunger every day, fighting the emotional eating. My emotional state is a little more stable now though so maybe I can really get a grip on this now. Dr. G lowered my Prozac a little bit. I've been feeling a bit numb and detached and that is usually a sign that I'm on too much. She only lowered it a small amount though so I should still be fine.
This community and various international political bodies tell us, “Yes, you’re entitled to defend yourselves. We can’t take that away from you. The right to self-defense is in the charter of the United Nations. So yes, you have to protect yourselves. But you mustn’t harm anybody who isn’t dangerous.” There is no such reality. Not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan.
Regarding Hispanics’ feelings about the Martin Hoax, I’m sure you’re right. The Left has for over 40 years promoted the myth, whereby blacks and Hispanics are one big happy family, and they have no intention of telling the truth now, especially when it could make or break the election.

Kate is the one person gifted enough to work the magic held in the ancient book of Wintercraft. And everyone wants her, either to lock her up or to use her as the ultimate weapon. Her rare power is being able to walk freely through the veil between life and death, and she cannot control it.
Biopics are tricky, but Milk largely succeeds where many stumble. It may play with the borders of its subject’s life, and there are a few moments that feel cheap but manage to move all the same (has Van Sant been taking lessons from Spielberg?), but I think it gives us a picture of a man who, thirty years after his death, continues to serve as a hero to many. As I was leaving the theater, I overheard a man asking his friend, “Is your nose running?” – receiving the reply, “I’ve been crying for two hours!” That’s the kind of film Milk is – unabashedly emotional, and sometimes highly-strung, but with a real heart and a mission, too. Perhaps not so different from the man himself.
But I'll also work a little bit harder to find those impressionable moments and grasp on tight. To set the laundry down long enough to look into a little one's shining eyes while they tell of an adventure or to give a shoulder to a teenager who is struggling to find a way to explain how they are feeling. To laugh and smile and visit more.

When Sonia answers her door to Jez, her friend’s teenage nephew, she sees a powerful reminder of someone from her youth. She lets Jez in and plies him with drink until he’s incapable of leaving. Perhaps the act isn’t intentional then, but when he is still in the house the following morning she visits her mother at her retirement home and returns with tranquilisers to help ensure Jez’s compliance. So very quickly her act becomes much more deliberate.
But the main reason for my attendance was to try the La Tur formaggio affinato with Unibroue’s Blanche de Chambly. Velveeta and Budweiser this is not. The soft white cheese is at times creamy and gooey and other times slightly dry. I could taste the grass that the cows, goat, and sheep consumed. It has a nice earthy aroma. And if finished with a dry, buttery mouth feel. It was really nicely spread on a baguette.
Well, since I am a big fan of Etsy and have a shop on there myself, I wanted to write a post about their Weddings and Registry section. I swear, this is one of the best things to come along since Martha Stewart Weddings! If you love unique handmade goods and live an indie lifestyle, than Etsy is right up your alley. Not only can you find amazing and beautiful items and accessories, you will be supporting artists who love what they do instead of large companies who certainly don’t need it.

Materials I used to make this card:
an unfair method of competition under Section 5. The commitment here was in the context of standard-setting. The Supreme Court repeatedly has recognized the procompetitive potential of standard-setting activities. However, because a standard may displace the normal give and take of competition, the Court has not hesitated to impose antitrust liability on conduct that threatens to undermine the standard-setting process or to render it anticompetitive. See Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, 226 U.S. 20, 41 (1912); Allied Tube & 7 Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 500 (1989); Am. Soc’y of Mech. Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 571 (1982). The conduct of N-Data. . . at issue here clearly has that potential.

Opelousas is one of the oldest towns in Louisiana. During her earliest days of French and then later, Spanish colonial rule, Opelousas was the headquarters of the Poste des Opélousas. During the War Between the States, after Les Americains captured Baton Rouge, Opelousas briefly became the Confederate capitol of the state (before the Yankees chased the state government up to Shreveport). It is because of her significant role in Louisiana’s history that Opelousas has so many significant homes, churches and buildings – and also many great old restaurants serving some of the finest Cajun and Creole food in Acadiana.
The inhumane actions he took it seemed enraged those he protected. The people believed he did more harm to them than good. But no, he treated the bodies with the respect any human being deserved. Because every being, when they’re dead, had no soul, no life anymore, in death, he surmised, they were all the same. All equal, all bad, all good, all the same. And thus he cleaned the bodies and prepared them for burial, wrapping white gauze around the body so they may be returned to their families. Some say he is the kindest of all those who sat around the table. Some say that he was least monstrous of them all.

We gave her words of encouragement, gave her ideas of how to fix it, gave her things to think about, make sure it is a marriage that she wants. And hung up with phone with her.
I highly recommend this book. It’s full of great crime mystery and suspense. There are some great plot twists that will have you guessing until the very end. I tend to be a very character-driven reader and my only problem is that I didn’t like Jane’s character, so I had trouble rooting for her. Not everyone is such a character-driven reader, and the story is great and very suspenseful. This is book one in a three book series and I’m hoping that Jane will grow on me as I read the rest of the series. I completely understood that she has to be tough to get anywhere in her position, but she came across as over ambitious and willing to sacrifice anything to get ahead in her career. The book itself is great, and it is fast-paced and will keep you turning the pages. These books were written specifically to be a television series, and this author only wrote these three episodes.
It’s clear that despite how she’s saying the word, she MEANS Obama, and I do NOT get into political discussions with random folks, whether I share an opinion or not. I personally believe ANY career politician is a bag of monkey waste covered in toxic sludge, but I don’t bother explaining that to most folks, because most people pick a side and love it to death.
Currently, US copyright claims have to go through the federal district courts (which have exclusive jurisdiction over copyright cases) whatever the value of the claim. The reasoning behind this is that as copyright law is federal law, it's only the federal courts which have the necessary experience to deal with these claims - plus, use of only federal courts will ensure consistency in dealing with copyright cases.
I was recently reminded of these journals by a thread on Facebook and mentioned to some fellow bloggers that I had once used them in my classroom and would they be something other teachers could use. Fellow blogger, Laura Candler, quickly responded to my mention and told me about her 'Happy Thoughts Journals' (read her blog post by clicking on this text). Thanks to her encouragement and support I dug out my old hand drawn worksheets and quickly got to tackling a digital unit for my Teachers Pay Teachers store.

Now it will be interesting to see how Camping responds if he even has any followers to listen to him anymore (not because they have been raptured). But my heart goes out to all of his followers because they have been duped and blinded by Camping and Satan is just enjoying himself to death (literally). I don’t think it is a stretch to say that some people will turn to thoughts of suicide and go into deep depression. I hope that this will pull the cover off of Camping’s misleading teaching and enable some of these people to be open to the truth.

The general premise of the game is to shoot correct sentences with green bullets and incorrect ones with red bullets. If done correctly, they will explode and their grammatical entrails will collect at the bottom. Though shooting them is how you get points, I think trying to get your pile higher and higher is more exciting. If you get one wrong, it marks the falsehood below in the score area and your entire pile falls away. The above image is from the Unclear Pronoun Antecedents level. Though not the most exciting thing I’ve made, I’m hoping it will impress the teacher.

My first week at WW I lost 9 lbs. and I lost every single week. By my birthday in May, I had lost over 50 lbs. in just 3 and 1/2 months. My WW leader was amazed that I would earn a star (you get a star for every 5 lb. loss) almost every other week. She was upset that I wasn't using up all my alloted points but I protested that I was so full from the soup. And it was healthy so it's not like I was doing anything bad.

This is a great question and I get it during consultations all the time. Science hasn’t given us a concrete answer; but what we are starting to determine is the “8 by 8″ rule is insufficient (meaning eight – 8oz glasses of water a day). The best I’ve come across is the idea that a bigger person needs more water and to use your urine as a gauge. Also, if you’re eating a high-fiber diet (and you should be) you need a bit more to “keep things moving”, if you catch my drift.
This however, is a passage that speaks nothing about government whatsoever. It is a passage that esteems the virtues of showing mercy and grace to one’s enemies, but it should be noted that this passage lacks any real political application, just as Matthew 25:31-46 lacks it – another oft quoted passage of social gospel proponents. We will not examine those passages further. We should however draw our attention to the one passage of Scripture where there is clear direction to Christians concerning the relationship between their faith and politics.
I can’t tell you how many tables I flipped during that last battle with Aizen. It was amazing. Just imagine: popcorn flying through the air, my dog perched on the sofa wondering what kind of seizure I was having… I even suspended my disbelief at the unveiling of Ichigo’s new power ups. I didn’t even bring up the blatant Dragon Ball Z rip-off (you know what I’m talking about). I was just happy that the story had finally reached a sensible conclusion.

“She was nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty in shape, but I had expended enough hard work on her to make me love her. No influential friend would have served me better. She had given me a chance to come out a bit—to find out what I could do. No, I don’t like work. I had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that can be done. I don’t like work—no man does—but I like what is in the work,—the chance to find yourself. Your own reality—for yourself, not for others—what no other man can ever know.”

This year, his "party" fell a solid month after his birthday. Exactly one day in advance, I emailed three friends' moms and asked if they could spend the night. "Sure," they all said. I didn't even tell them what time. I might have said, "We're eating at 6 if they want food." They all magically showed up around the same time (6:30). They dropped their backpacks and ran around barefoot in the back yard. (Yes, I know it's January. He's my third child.) We ate hamburgers. They ran outside again. They got dirty and smelly. They played the Wii and watched a movie. They went to sleep around 1:30. They woke up and ate waffles.

I've said in my bio that when I was a kid I drew horses, horses and more horses. The first drawing book I ever had was How to Draw Horses by Walter T. Foster. In it Mr. Foster showed how by using simple lines and shapes anyone could draw a horse. So in my head I've always seen the shape of a horse in a linear format.

I never met Linda. We lived hundreds of miles apart and even tho I plotted to get out East, I never made it. We "met" after I spotted a letter to the Editor in Comic Buyers Guide back in 1986. I responded to her letter as back then, many "fan type" publications gave actual addresses when printing a letter. We found we were both big fans of DC Comics, and shared a love of the Green Lantern Corps/Justice League, especially the character Guy Gardener . I mentioned to her that my perfect condition issue of GL #59 (first series) was half the price she paid for her copy in the same condition. This was before people began to SLAB their comics. We were fans of the comics to be read, not to be hermetically sealed and then sold for upgraded pricing.
The other reason that this hike intrigues me is because I took this awesome road trip with my parents in 2007 and we went to the Grand Canyon as part of that road trip. It was fantastic being able to spend that time with my parents. I was in awe and decided that I would like to go there again. I think it would be fun to do this trip with Fred… I think that we would have a BLAST!
Go to the movies. Where it is dark and soothing. Alone in your seat amidst a fleeting community. And then, take yourself out dancing to a club where no one knows you. Stand on the outside of the floor till the lights convince you more and more and the music shows you. Dance like no one’s watching…because, they’re probably not. And, if they are, assume it is with best of human intentions. The way bodies move genuinely to beats is, after all, gorgeous and affecting. Dance until you’re sweating, and beads of perspiration remind you of life’s best things, down your back like a brook of blessings.
Most actors think their first priority after moving to LA is to get an agent.I disagree.I think the first priority should be to build a body of work.Become a pro so that you are valuable to an agent.No agent wants to sign a non-union newbie.It’s not their job to get you ready.Join NowCasting.com or LACasting.com and submit yourself for non-union work. Get experience.These websites require you to pay a monthly fee for their service.I would normally warn you about places that charge you a fee, but NowCasting and LACasting are legit businesses.You post your photo and resume.They post casting notices for student films, short films, non-union work and some commercials.You are able to submit yourself for work and hope you get a request to audition.I have friends who work all the time doing this.It is a great way to get commercial work.I think the website LACasting.com submits their non-union members to commercial agents as part of their service.(You need to live in LA to participate.)

Can you imagine this in the UK? Imagine that a minister's husband or wife died in any circumstances, accidental, illness or, as in this case, suicide. It would be splashed across the front pages for days; there would be speculation and bios on the person's life.

Well, I DID catch some nice photos of a pair of black-with-white-chevrons ex K&O RR engines on the way up. And tomorrow's iteniary includes going into some really beautiful caves and then maybe a trip to see one of the world's few natural stone bridges AND a house-sized rock balanced on a tiny spire of rock, both of which, I'm told were featured on Ripley's Believe It Or Not. OH, and stopped by a gorgeous little tobacconist's place in Eureka Springs for a couple of Punch puros to puff on while we wandered the streets of this almost-New-Orleans-and-almost-Pacific-Northwest little town.

I was an only child. I say “was” because I do have step-siblings and a half-sister. But biologically, it’s just me. Even though my biological father refuses to acknowledge me anymore and claims the children of his other wives as his kids, I’m the last of his bloodline and he’s way too old and sick to do anything about it now. Yeah….he always told me about how awful it was when he was 4 and his father walked-out on his family and then never wanted to have anything to do with him until he’d remarried and divorced and had a bunch of kids in Utah somewhere and was dying and then tried to call my father for help and support. And my father, being the person he is, was more than happy to tell my biological paternal grandfather to shove it and didn’t give a crap even when I gave him the message sometime in the early 1980s that we’d gotten a phone call and his dad was dead.

B. A Spiritualizing Method Of Interpretation Of Scripture
One of the reasons why the Argentine economy collapsed was because the country’s rulers had insisted on maintaining the value of the Argentine peso even with the U.S. dollar, and wouldn’t allow its currency to decline in value. Greece uses the euro and therefore can’t devalue. Without a currency devaluation, internal cuts are the remaining option to meet market demands. When Argentina defaulted and allowed its peso to float freely, the peso’s value fell drastically. As a result, Argentina’s exports became attractively cheap and because imports became expensive, a stimulus to internal production was created. Within a year, Argentina’s unemployment rate fell by two-thirds and it had achieved budget and trade surpluses.

and services to assure consumers on the quality of the products that they purchase or that they would consider purchasing. This fundamental function cannot be fulfilled if trade marks are not noticeable, or unavailable, to consumers when selecting a product. The inability to recognize a brand or trade mark on a product would lead to consumer confusion, and therefore diminish the goodwill acquired in that brand through considerable investment and effort over a significant period of time. In fact the inability to call for or recognize a brand also takes away a consumer’s freedom of choice.

Why this works for me: starting early takes the pressure off. If I’m working on a reading guide at eight o’clock the night before it’s due, I won’t do a very good job, and I probably won’t learn much.

I did get a tank sample of the 70 Shilling he had coming, a lightly-peated sub-4% session beer, and had that with lunch, the pork pot roast, and you better believe that gave me some ideas for cooking. Sat there with Trip, and we talked about the season, and the whiffleball stadium (Pint-Size Park), and he finally asked me...how do I get someone like you to talk about these beers, because this kid -- Joe; he is pretty young! -- is doing a great job? Easy, Tripp: make good beers, get me to taste them. Done.

Unfortunately, I forgot to take a before picture but it wasn't much different from the after picture. All I did was fold the top down, so it was showing on the outside, then stitched it down and added elastic. I stitched 4 lines around the waistband hoping to stop it puckering so much but it hasn't worked really. I have to say I am pretty disappointed with the waistband but I figured it'll likely be hidden anyways so we'll go with it.
I go for a post-op tomorrow, and again on Tuesday, where I’m sure they’ll be able to tell me what my new eye site is (whether it’s 20/20 or better… or maybe a little less than perfect… but hopefully not)
As a (very minor) poet myself, I know the way that a character from a chance-read history can invade your consciousness. For me it was the confederate general, John Bell Hood. A few details about him from Shelby Foote's history of the American Civil War took root in my mind, and would not get out. There was a poem that needed to be written, and it was crystallizing around the figure of the young, blond-bearded, impetuous, not-quite-smart-enough Hood. There was something I knew about Hood that nobody else knew. Something I understood, and that needed to be said.
step 4: Change the size of text as needed by highlighting the text (double click on it or on the text layer in the layers palette—the "T" thumbnail icon, not the layer name) and selecting a new font size in the menu bar. Alternately, you can bring up a some free transform handles by holding the command key (Mac) or Crtl for you Windows folks. Those little handles will let you drag and distort the font as you like, the disadvantage of this latter technique being that you can't make it constrain the proportions (experts please correct me if I'm wrong). You can see the highlighted text (now looking too big) with the transform handles below:

Blech. It was extremely unexciting, though edible. I was going for something amazing, something bursting with flavor. Again, perhaps a different vendor would have offered that, but these felt like a big waste of money at $18 for 2 hot dogs and two chicken kebobs. Later that same evening we splurged on cupcakes and black-and-white cookies (in upstate NY we call those half-moon cookies) at a bakery near Times Square. That was the absolute WORST black-and-white cookie I have ever encountered. It so scarred me that I never got another one while there. I don't know if the upstate vs. downstate definition is different or what, but I will have to make a batch of my own to satisfy my craving.

Then we have Roberts playing the prerequisite jivey black guy to the chagrin of all the white honky mothers in this vast galactic setting. It's a nice effort to get a Cleavon Little/Blazing Saddles vibe going, but only if you have the writing and talent to pull it off. These guys? Let's just say that Roberts comes off more as an annoyance than a character. This would probably be the most viable reason he's played it under the radar for the rest of his career after the Eighties. Wouldn't you have?

Some of you may recognize these gorgeous silver urns (Mine are currently sitting on top of my mantle)-- Super Mom snagged them on sale at Pottery Barn and purchased a pair for herself, me and Nene as Christmas gifts. She knew that they would be PERFECT going down the center table at our reception (as well as being GREAT Christmas gifts!) -- she was right.
Inside herself she knew that her desires would open a huge can of worms, yet her heart was being suffocated, in the closet. Through Randy’s unconditional love for Nancy, she realized that her happiness was more important than her hometown reputation. ”You can’t live your life trying to please other people.” Randy told her as he held tightly to her hand. “I know that Randy. But I can’t disappoint my friends and family at home. I wouldn’t hurt them for anything in this world.” Nancy replied as tears ran down her face. “What makes you think you could ever disappoint anyone. Everyone loves you, just like I do.” Randy said as he gave her an intense hug. He tried to help Nancy see that her way of thinking was wrong. He knew that Nancy’s family loved her. Her decision to be happy could never hurt those that love her. Her happiness was all they wanted to begin with.

Jill is the only contributor to the book that I knew in my life before becoming an artist. In fact, we have known each - in one form or another - for nearly 20 years. We both live in NYC and originally met because many years ago we lived on the same block and saw each other every morning while we waited to take the same bus to the same location, as we both worked in the same place. Much has changed since then but when you fast forward many years, there is still something that we share: art.
First the firm should consider exactly what it is that makes or is likely to make the firm competitive. The questions here include “which of our services help us to compete, what specialist focus can we have which will win us work, and what is our pricing model that helps define us?”. Where the building and maintenance of strong relationships with clients and referrers is seen as a vital part of the firm’s recipe for success, those relationships must be nurtured and renewed, not just by being nice to clients but by providing them with services that they will continue to fins valuable. The basis for a firm’s competitive strategy is largely client oriented and externally focused. If the clients can see no added benefit or advantage from the firm, then the firm is not likely to develop a winning competitive edge. What is clear is that the firm must decide how it wants to be seen in its marketplace, what position in this market it wishes to occupy and what type of client will provide its core as it goes forward.

Isozaki designed the famous Team Disney Building (1990) in Florida, complete with his signature exaggerated forms and intersecting planes. The finished building is childlike, like an amusement park, filled with Mickey Mouse motifs and a giant sundial on the roof to represent the shift in time for the executives within who spent many hours at work. Each of the building elements is bright (atypical of a building containing office workers), and contradictory to each other in detailing, but unified by the softer pastel palette. Isozaki made extensive reference to the business of Disney (this building in particular housed the administrative arm of the Walt Disney World Resort) but he also incorporated his traditional eastern influences of Yin and Yang space, with Japanese rock gardens. It is this appropriation of western and eastern elements, modern technology and childs playground elements for an office building, that showcase this building as post modern architecture. You can see live footage here.
But make no mistake about it, the reason the Republican campaign has turned so nasty and so divisive is because the Romney campaign and its supporters decided in Iowa to win at any price, a theme which continues to this day even if it means embracing Nancy Pelosi and distorting the history of the Reagan revolution.

Apparently the junta continues to exercise some degree of control over the content of state media. Inside the ORTM compound, amid the usual bustle of employees and visitors, dozens of soldiers lounge in small groups. A twin-barreled anti-aircraft gun sits in the back of the courtyard, facing the entrance. It is ideally positioned to take out any nearby threat, such as the Hotel de l’Amitié. If you’re checking in there, I’d avoid getting a room on the upper floors.

Then I cut a "starter cut" randomly around the bottom edges of the linen and ripped it up to the base of the lampshade. I liked the wild, rough, unfinished look this gave it. I think it made it more whimsical. I took strips of coordinating brocade, polka dot and striped fabric and tied them randomly around the linen strips for some color and more whimsical fun. It's hard to see in the badly lit photos, but I also glued a floor length of shiny, glittery cream netting that will hang down around a comfy chair.

One comment says that it's in poor taste but not racism. What do you need for things to BE racism then? -_- Nething short of "I wanna wipe Asian ppl off the face of the earth" I guess doesn't qualify. xD This isn't even like something you can claim is an accident, like the person who threw the banana at the black hockey player claiming that he JUST HAPPENED to have a banana at hand and wanted to impede him. I find it unlikely and probably an excuse (and even if not they should have been aware of the implications of throwing a banana at a black person) but at least it's possible, even if not an excuse for the harm caused. But "Lady Chinky Eyes" to an Asian person in replacement of their real name on the receipt? xD Yeah... nobody does that by accident.

Sad to say, the state of Texas headed over to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals the next day and got an emergency stay on Judge Yeakel’s order. Texas A.G. Greg Abbott argued that the great state of Texas would be “irreparably harmed” if it could not continue to block Planned Parenthood’s participation. It all goes back to a 2005 law blocking abortion “affiliates” from receiving funds. Lawyer Abbot did not say why it was that Texas hasn’t bothered until 2012 to try to enforce the law. Lawyer Abbott argued:
Sorry for the photo, it looks a bit bright. Please bear with me and my stupid camera and lack of proper photography skills. Looking at it on-screen, the "tan" is showing up WAY yellow, really it's more subtle IRL. It looks like I am totally off, not something I like to do when working the color combos. Well, I found this gorgeous color combo of blues and tans in the Studio Calico - Field Guide Kit (November 2011). I subscribe to four kits a month and really, I hoard them all. I was on Skype with past DT Member Fiona Kenward while I was making my card, and told her I was always afraid of cutting paper, it was just too pretty. Or to use up gorgeous supplies? What if I wanted to use them later and didn't have because I already finished them up? She just laughed. Yes, I hoard.

You might find it interesting that prior to 1999 I had been under the teachings of various churches that all taught that a person’s salvation was not always permanent. These people seldom spoke about “the judgment seat of Christ”. They didn’t seem to believe in the idea of receiving rewards. They usually spoke of “the great white judgment” that was for the unsaved, and that was the only type of judgment they really seemed to think about. Then I came to believe that salvation is always permanent, and not long after that we joined a type of Baptist church simply because we did not know that there were other denominations beside Baptists that believed that saved people always stay saved. I know I have already told you about our history of church experiences, and I will now try to get to my point. The pastor of that particular church believed that it was of utmost importance that we never forget that believers would definitely appear before “The Judgment Seat of Christ” and he would warn us continually that we should be very concerned about that. I am sure you know me well enough by now to know that as a result I went from being very afraid of losing my salvation to being afraid of getting a rebuke instead of a reward at the Judgment Seat of Christ”, as well as bouts of fear that my sins proved that I might have failed to put my faith in Christ in the first place ( I still battle that one some.) We all had two verses memorized. Here they are :
“You’re right, Chief. The whole disappearance thing was a farce. I was supposed to hide away for few days up in the woods, in a place that Sharshar had prepped for me to live in for a while. And then at a certain date and time I was to go to a prearranged location and lie beneath the shadow of huge walnut tree….” Nibras paused here, unable to complete. Mr. Think did that for him:
A kiss between them was to be expected though I didn’t expect Amelie to lose IQ points in the process. Killing Claire and Shane -not a good idea. I can’t believe Oliver had to step in and change her mind. Her manipulation of Myrnin when it came to this was appalling. Her actions destroyed previously strong relationships. Shane and Claire have been huge assets and her fear of this new enemy has turned her into a coward. That’s not what we’ve come to expect of her.

‘Lolita’ is an incredible novel and a vastly important to the nature of modern fiction; however some audiences will not be able to go beyond Humbert’s methods of description or overlook the actuality of the tale. Despite this, ‘Lolita’ is a deeply entertaining ride through the mind of an articulate, semi-intelligent predator and the second half of the novel had me turning the pages hurriedly, wondering what would become of poor Lolita.

A website is just like a real office. You will need to keep it updated, stylish and fresh. Search engine optimization (SEO) is also a must, along with websites that work with mobile technology.

For the girls this means sundresses and sandals matched with the perfect pair of Raybans. You gotta love the spring “fashion” if nothing else!

You know when you’re having one of those horrible days, nothing seems to go right, everyone is out to get you and you can’t breathe from all the pressure coming at you from every direction… did you forget to walk with Jesus that day? Did you give Him those troubles that were weighing you down? Or were you trying to do it all on your own like we so often do.

Scripture provides not only the raw data for understanding who the historical Jesus is but it also provides the God-given interpretive framework, structure, and categories by which we grasp his identity and thus construct an objectively grounded and warranted christology. In this way, Scripture serves as our epistemological norm for understanding who Jesus is apart from all historical-critical reconstructions of the text (p. 64).

Slippery entrails slide through my fingers as I gorge on him. In that moment I learn what it is to seek out the living, and their importance to me. I press my face into his stomach; the warmth feels so good to me. As I struggle to devour the man's intestines, his pants slid down exposing himself to me. I open my mouth and receive it in one bite; pulling it away from his body with my teeth until it could stretch no more, snapping free from him in a burst of bright crimson. His blood flows down my lips, dripping wetness down onto my breasts where his hands were just a moment ago.

Upon getting up and heading out to the airport I remember feeling nervous and excited while I followed the white 16 passenger van to Charlotte International. We unloaded our bags and parked the vehicles, then proceeded to check in. Finally after some strategic baggage checking to avoid more fees, we passed through security and boarded our Delta flight headed for Atlanta Georgia. It was only a 30-40 minuet flight to Atlanta, however it was a fun experience as it was my first time flying. I remember a few members of my group were terrified, I on the other hand fought a half winning battle to continuously look out the window over my partners shoulder. As we flew into Atlanta I was amazed at the view. I had never seen a city so vast and wide…and the airport…all I could think was “Wow, this place is huge!”
I think I still have a bit of a hangover from WBW's 1st anniversary blast last week. My mind is blank, over played in the face of the remarkable nature of your kind comments and well wishes. My pictures seem random and disconnected as I look for candidates to splash a blog post with. It's hard to see a thread of logic or a story to connect them with. I wish I had a good turkey picture to make ironic Thanksgiving comments about, maybe relate it to the naive Native Americans who paid a hefty price for the sin of poor character assessment when the billowing sails of ocean going vessels first tipped over the Eastern Horizon. That point has been made, sharpened many times over.

Anyone in the industry will tell you that having the right location is key.

We don’t have a big studio backing us (yet!) so all we have to rely on is lots of searching and plenty of blagging.

How to explain what has happened, is happening, to me. It's as if my real life exists, and I can see it unfolding, and I'm alive in it...sort of...but I'm also observing it, as if from a great distance away. A continual out-of-body experience, every waking moment of my day. I can see myself folding laundry and doing dishes, walking the dog through the snowy landscape of Brooklyn, choosing apples in the grocery store, and Nutella on sale, and tomatoes and onions, and chicken for the soup, but all of this takes place in one realm while my mind wanders freely, intently, elsewhere.

In this case it's another oak aged stout. And true to form it pours well, but I already can't stand the smell. It's an opaque black with brown highlights and a decent tan head. Smells like whisky (no 'e') though, not beer. Smells smoother than some American variants though, so maybe Scottish whisky really is better than American whiskey.

I have a back log of pre-recorded TV shows, and I am slowly whittling my way through them. Last weekend, it was "The Barefoot Contessa" shows that I decided to watch. Truthfully, I tend to fast-forward through most of my recorded episodes. If something catches my eye, then I pay close attention. This recipe comes from Ina's "Back to Basics" Cookbook that I own. The episode was called "Postcards from Paris". I've never been to Paris, which also included the recipe for making Potato Basil Puree-- that I've since made, loved and posted on my blog. Had I not watched Ina's show, I probably wouldn't have made this particular recipe. Maybe it sounded so "basic", but seeing things can be powerful persuasion.
And aside from the back that my quads were aching and my body was in general, a little rickety, it was a fun way to end the weekend.

This Spring has been a season of garden anniversaries for me. Six years ago, my partner and I bought our home in Flatbush. In the first month after closing, I began weeding, composting, and envisioning the gardens. Five years ago, I started this blog to document what I was doing and record my explorations.

To be honest, I've not read paranormal ghost stories before. I've read books which have ghosts in, but they haven't been the main focus. However, Shade is nothing I would have expected of ghostly paranormal, and, I feel, quite unique. The world she has set up is fascinating and intriguing, and not all questions are answered for the world as a whole, let alone us as readers. Smith-Ready was very clever in how she set out this story. There is a self-contained plot for Shade, about the death of Aura's boyfriend, Logan, and their relationship while he's a ghost. But there is also the bigger picture of the Shift, and the importance of Aura, who was born one minute after the Shift happened, and Zachary, who was born one minute before. Aura wants to find out what caused the Shift, and believes her mother, who died of Cancer when Aura was three, had discovered something, through reading her diaries. The story with Logan is sweet and sad and quite worrying, but it's the bigger picture that kept me reading.

Hello, so glad you stopped by. I made this pretty little ditty just 'cause I wanted to use my new Pion paper. It is just so gorgeous and it was just sitting on my shelf gently whispering to me...come on, don't you want to see what you can make with me??? It's been there for two weeks now and finally wore me down and here's the result of my playing around this evening. I started with the Vintage Cabinet Card die. I cut a base in white CS and then a couple of layers of the Pion Studio of Memories 6x6" paper. The top of the white base that shows on top got a coat of Rock Candy Distress Crackle Paint and when dry, I sponged Antique Linen DI over it. The flower was created using several dies, white CS, Weathered Wood DI, stamped lightly with a script stamp in Ranger Sepia Archival Ink. The flourishes are from the Festive Greenery die and the Venise Lace fan is from my Etsy shop. I dyed it with coffee and painted it with Weathered Wood reinker/water mixture. Weathered Wood really matches the paper perfectly. I made the little sentiment label on my computer and gave it a couple of coats of UTEE and sponged it with Vintage Photo DI. I decided I wanted it to be a free standing desk bling so I added a stand cut with the Small Easel Die.

十多年前台灣剛開放人民赴大陸旅遊，當時大陸很窮、台灣錢好用，我們有很多囂張沒水準的行徑。現在台灣人也要有認知，大陸人有些舉動，看在台灣人眼裡覺得沒有水準，但那是他們發展的過度期，他們也逐漸在改變、進步當中。林龍說，十多年前台灣剛開放人民赴大陸旅遊時，我們有些暴發戶去那邊一擲千金，也是有很多囂張沒水準的行徑。當時大陸很窮、台灣錢好用，大陸有些地方吐一口痰要罰五塊錢人民幣，結果就有台灣人故意呸呸呸呸，「給你二十元」。
So, how is the wealth transfer working out so far in Spain? Judge for yourself with the examples below. While far from comprehensive, and nowhere close to the raw misery brought upon countries like Greece (yet), it paints a portrait of the times far more real than abstract macroeconomics.

On with the room, we stayed at a boutique hotel called The O Hotel. I have no idea what the “O” stands for unless it stands for “O, this hotel is dang expensive!”. But I shouldn’t complain, the cost of lodging did not come out of my pocket, and it was pretty nice and more importantly clean.

While not the longest, this is the biggest race I have ever been a part of. I had no idea what the course was like and had intended walking/driving some of it on the day before. This unfortunately didn’t happen. I did however, have a lovely day sightseeing in Sydney. At about 600km(373mi) from home and with a young family, we don’t go often. The Kids were 1 1/2 and 3 1/2 at the time. The picture of them below with my wife, in Hyde park with the Centerpoint Tower behind them, is still the background on my phone.

This semester at college, I had to fulfill my physical education credits. One of the classes I am taking is more of a sit down kind of class that teaches health and nutrition, but the other is a basic physical fitness course where I actually have access to a gym with treadmills, weights and other gym equipment. This was the perfect opportunity for me to try PhitGrips, which are designed to create a barrier between you and the millions of germs commonly found on gym weights and workout equipment.

I know. I am very much aware that these feelings were way too much for my incapable brain to comprehend. I’d toss and turn and glare at the ceiling until the indigo skies would look like its on fire again. Then as if on cue, I’d find myself thinking about her. I cannot tell you how serious my situation was. I’d lost my ability to analyze things and the new found feelings were now tough to grasp. It was like the thought of girls have become my kryptonite and the more I get closer to it, the weaker my body became. Life, I’ve learned, is always unpredictable. For who could have known that I would someday I would be in this mess?

“Unemployment compensation, as we conceive it, is a front line of defense, especially valuable for those who are ordinarily steadily employed, but very beneficial also in maintaining purchasing power.

Miscarried babies cannot be used in the production of vaccines since most miscarriages are due to chromosomal abnormality and therefore renders the tissue too dangerous to use in case there is any transference of disease into the vaccinated person. Early embryonic cells can also not be used as they are not large enough to take a tissue sample from, therefore all unborn children used in vaccine production must be over the age of 12 weeks gestation and without any genetic abnormality.

"Plow started playing punk rock in 1992. For the first couple years they played at farmers markets and pizza places all over the West Chester, PA area. They released their first seven-inch in 1994 then they made more vinyl, purchased their beloved van Sadi, and embarked on their first tour. In 1995, they were forced to change their name to Plow United by some band from Baltimore. At the start of 1997 Sean began to teach high school math and the boys decided to call it quits. They played a heartwarming final show in Philadelphia in front of over 400 of their friends that had been there from the beginning."

10, 1951 and attended the Christian Brothers school on Sexton Street, Limerick. He left his father’s plant hire business at the age of 20 to become a racecourse bookmaker, but then took the less well-trodden route of gamekeeper-turned-poacher when becoming a professional punter. McManus recalls one of his first bets as being on Merryman II in the 1960 Grand National when he was just nine, but the bet that changed his life was £4 on Linden Tree in a Newmarket maiden in 1970, the horse winning at 100/8. He had another £4 on when Linden Tree won the Observer Gold Cup at 25/1, and £5 each-way at 33/1 for the Derby, when the horse beat all bar Mill Reef. The amount he wagered grew rapidly and he is still one of the highest-staking punters on the racecourse. Dubbed “the Sundance Kid” by journalist Hugh McIlvanney after a number of major gambles in the ring during the 1970s, he is also the biggest jump owner in terms of numbers in Britain, Ireland and France (some 300 horses spread over 50 trainers ran for him last season) after he purchased his first racehorse, Cill Dara, at the age of 26. He has a host of business interests including dealing on the financial markets from his Geneva base and part-ownership of the Sandy Lane Hotel in Barbados, where he also has a house. With John Magnier, he bought a 28.7% stake in Manchester United through the Cubic Expression company before subsequently selling out to US tycoon Malcolm Glazer in 2005. He was in the news shortly after that because of his stake in the pub and restaurant operator Mitchells and Butler. In 2011, the Sunday Times estimated McManus’ wealth at £481 million, making him the 12th richest person in Ireland. Since Mister Donovan landed the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle in 1982, he has enjoyed 36 other Cheltenham Festival successes, headed by the great three-time Champion Hurdle hero Istabraq and the brilliant Baracouda, who landed the 2002 and 2003 renewals of what is now the Ladbrokes World Hurdle. In 2010, he won a fourth Champion Hurdle with Binocular. This year was a memorable Cheltenham Festival for the owner, whose five victories at The Festival included Synchronised, victorious in the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup. McManus does a lot of work for charity and his Pro-Am golf tournament, which takes place every five years, has raised over 95 million euros. McManus is also a keen backgammon player and a big hurling fan. He owns Jackdaws Castle, the Gloucestershire yard that Jonjo O’Neill trains from, and has invested heavily in improving facilities since purchasing the property in 2001. He was British champion owner for the 2005/6, 2006/7, 2008/9 and 2009/10 seasons. A full

Wow has it been a long week off for the kids, honestly feels like a month not a week. It's been rough, becuase the weather has been pretty much cold and crappy the entire week so the kids couldn't really get outside to play much. One of the upsides to daddy being laid off for the winter is that I was able to get him to take the older ones out places a few times..took the birthday boy (Logan is 9 today) to grandpas for a sleepover the other night and then took Logan, Abriana, Andrew & Roman to chuck e cheese Friday for Logan's bday. Bella and I enjoyed the peace and quiet that is so rare at home while they were gone.

There are certainly elements of both. On the one hand, I've got a much better grasp now than I used to have of how to use environmental and physical description to flesh out a scene, and of how to write about internal psychological processes (which I used to avoid altogether due to terror of 'telling' too much). On the other, eight months ago I thought of myself as a sci-fi author, despite the overwhelming fantasy bias of my bookcase.
We have finally managed to get a copy of the order of the Customs Commissioner in the Dell case, which I had blogged about yesterday. The order is accessible over here and the previous post is available over here. As explained in the earlier post, the Customs Commissioner had allowed the parallel import of Dell computers into India on the grounds that the Trade Mark Act, 1999 did not forbid such imports.

For this many people populating our dying planet squeezed under unbearable restrictions growing stricter, like a house where the windowless rooms grow smaller, tighter, in every dimension, the unbalanced, the beaten-down, the confused, well, somethings gotta blow and many are blowing now. In the Culture of Extinction (Charles' title), the tight lids "always-misfits" hide under are coming unglued. They seem to arrive from diseased (dis-eased) roots, early on find solace in imitation, but poisoned by BGH and weed killer, never fitting into any mold whatsoever. They grew misanthropic over time except for what survival for themselves could be appropriated through innocent others, whether in a volcanic release of roiling under the surface pent-up energies or a pure expression of hatred of humanity manifesting through acting-out a perceived satanic part in the great comedy. Couple this stark void of self-awareness and lack of free will with all else happening environmentally and politically throughout the globe, sprinkle on stubborn chemtrails, the unpunished crimes of political criminals, increasing indebtedness and a representative-self dictating survival by any means within immediate reach and you get deformed, crippled behaviors that by their very grossness, further infect and upend everything surrounding them never to return to anything resembling even remote stability. Prison and programs are mere placeholders because the thing unrecognized is the healing required to eliminate these crimes against the innocent comes only from within. As long as everyone going along to get along appears to survive in the Culture of Extinction, the example from on high set in stone and widely approved, the crippled mannequin, the failed prototype, still imitating, sees himself as deserving his role in that culture. Giving vent to his rage is just a small part of an evolving malevolent philosophy likely glimpsed during the formative years with self-inflicted unhealthy and repetitive doses of pcp tranched with speed.

In addition to the four different types of monsters, two halves of a Yoshi eggshell will also fall. The bottom eggshell half behaves like a monster: it disappears when it comes into contact with another bottom half. However, if a falling top half comes into contact with a bottom half, the two will join and hatch a Yoshi, earning the player bonus points. Furthermore, if a stack of monsters grows atop a bottom half and a top half is then added, all monsters between the halves will be encased and eliminated. Larger Yoshi characters will hatch depending on the number of monsters encased, which also increases the number of bonus points awarded. If a falling top half does not have any bottom half to join to in the stack it touches, it is automatically removed and no points are awarded.
I was really clueless, in every sense of the word.

It was Tuesday, July 6th. We had a nice relaxing day of doing not much of anything. Amber and I had been out at the pool with my nephews, Blake (10), Greggory (7), Tucker (22mo), and Emma. Amber had to be to church in a bit, so she headed in to get ready, took Tucker with her. I stayed outside so that Blake, Greggory, and Emma could swim for a few more minutes. A huge horsefly decided to start bothering the kids, so they all wanted to get out of the pool and go in side. Blake and Greggory grabbed towels and dried off a bit, I wrapped Emma up in a towel (arms tucked in) then told the kids to head inside while I cleaned up our things.
America's democracy promotion agenda is understood in China as designed to sabotage the Communist Party’s leadership. The leadership therefore actively promotes efforts to guard against the influence of American ideology and U.S. thinking about democracy, human rights, and related issues. This perceived American effort to divide and weaken China has been met by building increasingly powerful and sophisticated political and technological devices to safeguard domestic stability. U.S. arms sales to Taiwan despite vastly improved cross-Strait relations—and close-in surveillance activities off China's coasts—contribute to Beijing's deepening distrust of U.S. strategic intentions in the national security arena. Washington’s recent rebalancing toward Asia further contributes to this sense of threat. American diplomatic positions spanning North Korea, Iran, and countries in Southeast Asia are discomfiting and increase Chinese suspicions of U.S. intentions. China’s criticisms of, and resistance to, some of America’s international policies and actions toward the Korean Peninsula, Iran, Syria, and elsewhere reflect the suspicion that they are based on injustice and narrow U.S. self-interest that will directly or indirectly affect China’s interests.

Hello all - I am just loving all the crafty secrets stamps - especially the little sets which are great for ATCs and small cards. I have made 2 ATCs (which I don't make very often) using Material Girl and Queen Bee which are available here . I used sticky back canvas on card for the base and then painted it and used stencils etc for the backgrounds;
I am grateful for my work that allows me to occasionally experience things out of the ordinary like travelling to another city (not to mention pay my rent and allow me to eat, pay my bills, and do all the other givens of living in society), and struggled also with the idea that I could not find a silver lining in this somewhere. I did asana in my room all week to survive this surreal place, which truly is a metaphor for America today. But no matter where we find ourselves, and no matter what our likes and dislikes do to create imbalance within us, we can choose to simply be with what is and allow the experience to emerge, instead of always trying to manufacture the experience to fit our desires or expectations (as Las Vegas does so expertly).
Busy month for me with a trip to DC followed by a trip to Vegas for work. In the short month I have unofficially ( I weigh in on Saturdays) lost 4 lbs. I also managed to get my butt back to Bikram. I have been twice this week and I'm feeling sore but, it is a good sore. I've been inconsistent with my running and I worked out ZERO times in Vegas but walked A LOT and I didn't gain an ounce. In retrospect a pretty good month. Exercise could be better, but I was very conscience of my diet.
I wish we had some real statistics on the growing awakening, but we’re seeing the indicators every day. The PTBs can hardly get away with a thing without the alternative research community being all over it.

I’m proud to say they’re on it!

I thought I'd share how we do our wrapping in the hope of pulling more mommas away from the huge mess and waste that comes from gift wrap.
Every family has their ‘inside’ jokes that only mean something to them. Something happens, someone says “That reminds me of the time….” and everyone begins laughing at the memory. A child pipes up with a comment – usually out of context – and everyone laughs and enjoys that moment together. Laughter should be listed on the menu for the meal…laughter, love and joy – the key ingredients to a happy Thanksgiving dinner. The turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing are just incidentals.

Where I live I need to drive 35 to 40 minutes to a store that sells a graphics card.

I'm too impatient though and will probably brave the Mother's Day weekend traffic in Erie.

And then one day, perhaps as we were making our way to be crowned Prom King and Queen, Naomi and I would encounter Chuck Logan. Chuck had been captain of the soccer team and an A grade student before my glorious arrival. Now he was a high school dropout slinging crystal meth for a living. "Oh look, it's the Irish fag and his fag-hag" he'd sneer to his crackhead buddies, who definitely carried an air of menace. And I, I'd whip a can of Lynx Africa out of the back pocket of my Ralph Lauren suit trousers, and spray it against the flame from my lighter to form a blowtorch to scorch the skin off Chuck Logan's face. As he lay writhing acridly on the ground I'd douse the rest of his body in Lynx Africa and then take the cigarette out of my mouth and say "No, this is a fag, ya fuckin' eejit!" as I calmly flicked it onto him and watched him burn. Then I'd force-feed his charred remains to Shelley Aryanski for being a meddling bitch.
Regarding fiscal stability, jurisdictions employing the practices that Section 1 of the bill proscribes – accepting a partial amount of the bail required, will lose flexibility to manage some costs associated with a criminal case, such as those associated with incarceration or appointed counsel. Considering the budget issues the State and local jurisdictions are facing, institutionalizing, rather than banning this type of system would be more supportive of local justice system operations.
"Hows the new job?"
Few Chinese companies have the systematic ability to develop a deep understanding of customers’ problems. Domestic players have traditionally had a manufacturing-led focus on reapplying existing business models to deliver products for fast-growing markets. These “push” models will find it increasingly hard to unlock pockets of profitable growth. Shifting from delivery to creation requires more local research and development, as well as the nurturing of more market-driven organizations that can combine insights into detailed Chinese customer preferences with a clear sense of how the local business environment is evolving. Requirements include both research techniques relevant to China and people with the experience to draw out actionable customer insights.

In the last few weeks there have been far too many days when I couldn't keep my eyes open. Not because of tiredness but from some mysterious pain that no one could figure out. This meant hours spent sitting in my arm chair by the window not reading but with an ice pack on my face. During this time, I realized just how much I rely on sight.

When I first found out I did not get into grad school, I felt devastated. Shocked. Stunned. But, now that I look back on it, I realize my Higher Power had something else in mind for me. It is strange how things work out sometimes, and once you learn to look for the right signs to guide you...you realize, that it is always meant to be. EVERYTHING happens for a reason.
I have always had a thing for younger men. Must be genetic (I blame genetics for a lot of things). Sometimes when I’m at home doing homework I have the television on for background noise mostly. I am not sold out on the American Idol season (I thought Jeremy Rosado was robbed when they cut him and kept a couple of other singers that were mediocre at best). Something happened that I am having trouble explaining, Phillip Phillips creeped up on me. He annoyed the shit outta me for I don’t know how long with his Dave Matthew influenced way of singing and moving, and that big vein that pops out across his head when he sings. I dismissed him early on. Then “it” happened.
The OSHA certification requires employers to certify that each operator of a unit is trained and evaluated to meet the safety requirement standards as set by OSHA regulations. The assessment and OSHA certification is done by an approved and qualified agency. The training and evaluation should include a lecture, practical demonstration through videos and interactive computer instruction. Employers are required by the regulation to verify whether the employee has received proper training. They are evaluated every three years to make sure that the abilities are as sharp as ever.

Here's the basic plot, sick racists have the tables turned on them! A revenge ploy turns into a bloodbath, and an onslaught of depravity! More like big time wrasslin' than championship boxing, it's twelve rounds of eye-poking, cheapshot kicks to the gonads, and in the end, it's a draw!! You're kidding yourself if you think I'm joking!

this is an aircraft carrier gliding past our windows yesterday afternoon…….not one of our better spring days that’s for sure. There were also some whales reported in the same area but you can imagine how tough they’d have been to spot given this view of the 338.2m long USS John C Stennis!

In the moneymaking stakes it certainly beats hands down the option of merely giving it to a smart creative team and asking them to come up with another ad in an already successful campaign.
Instead of taking along my worthless resume, I’ll just bring along a bunch of green bananas…just to prove there’s lots of life left in this ol’ girl.
Afterward we had lunch in a park back near school. I sat with a student and asked him what his favorite part of the symphony was. “The part where we got to yell out Mambo!” He replied. “What was your favorite instrument?” “The big violin.” He smiled. “That’s called a cello.” I told him. As we continued eating lunch on the park bench he began telling me about his favorite Formula 1 race car driver, a Brazilian named Ayrton Senna. Senna was considered one of the best at his highly dangerous sport. The boy listed off all of Senna’s best races. Then he recalled Senna’s last race. At the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix Senna was in the lead. On a seemingly routine lap, his car smashed into the wall on a sharp turn. I asked the boy if Senna survived the accident. “No, he died,” the boy replied, unaffected by the weight of the story.

Perhaps surprisingly, he does not fall under suspicion for long, but makes haste to involve Dr Gideon Fell and Fell's chum, Superintendent Hadley. It then turns out that his cousin has also been murdered recently, in a small village. One link between the deaths of husband and wife is the observation of a uniformed hotel attendant near both crime scenes.
One of my friends is a harp therapist for a hospice center. The stories I’ve heard from her experiences of singing and playing for the terminally ill make me believe that the harp is a divine instrument. It has been said that sounds reverberating from a harp enters not only through the ears, but also through the skin. Imagine—lying in a comatose state nearing death and still being ministered through music!

This season of The Good Wife has been one of change, where seeming inevitabilities and endpoints came to a head, only to take on much more complexity and instability than previously imagined. Alicia and Will finally got together, but they split for the most mundane reason imaginable: Alicia’s desire to not let romantic feelings leave her an unfocused mother during a messy separation. Will’s gambling debts came back to haunt him, but the grand jury investigation fell apart in a series of awkward, bitter runarounds. And Cary’s place at the heart of the District Attorney’s office was ripped out from under him, making his return to Lockhart/Gardner tarnished with failed ambition.

RR—Yeah. I’ve read some anthropologists who’ve studied primitive cultures and many of these cultures—those cultures develop that highly developed psychic side of the mind, but it’s like if you’re gonna deal with a culture like that you have to be able to confront it in ways that don’t alienate them. Like he was talking about a culture, I think it was in New Guinea, that he wanted to study as an anthropologist. And of course these are shamanic cultures and they’re warrior cultures and so on.

Look, I favor some politicians over others, naturally. The party that’s less disciplined, more diverse and willing to negotiate strikes me as better than one that is the most tightly disciplined and dogmatic political force - and the most fiercely anti-science - in American history, controlled by a media empire owned by unfriendly foreigners.

It was another sunny, beautiful day in Seattle yesterday and so when I got home from work I sat out on the deck for awhile, basking in the sunshine and warmth. As I looked out over the planting bed, I noticed a shrub with blooms that I don't remember from last year. I sat enjoying looking at the variety of greens/golds/reds of new growth on all the shrubs and finally couldn't stand it. I had to take a closer look at the splash of orange in the flower bed.

Inside our human brains we have something called the Limbic system. It is one of the oldest parts of our brain and it controls all our primary needs and we share it with the rest of the mammals on earth. But the human brain continued to evolve, and the evolution gifted us with an unique intelligence that expected us to separate from the rest of the animals. But in critical situations, when we get scared or feeling threatened, the Limbic system takes over and in an attempt to defend ourselves we react and behave exactly as the animals we once were. I am convinced that frightened people (just like animals) can be very dangerous.

The two primary musical influences on "Eight Miles High" were Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar (who taught George Harrison how to play that instrument) and avant-garde jazz saxophonist John Coltrane. According to Roger McGuinn, the only recorded music that the Byrds brought along on the 1965 American tour was a tape with Ravi Shankar ragas on one side and two Coltrane albums on the other. "We played that damn thing 50 or 100 times through a Fender amplifier" that was plugged into the electrical system of the band's tour RV, McGuinn said.

Even though I try desperately to be a Jesus Lover, to live by the Norman Family Creed, to dismantle the Failure Siren, it all came to a head last week. I now understand better than ever before why the Lord implores us to humble ourselves. Being humbled by the reality of your own sinful nature totally sucks. The difference between knowing in your head that you are a sinner, and watching your sin punch someone you love in the stomach is severe.

It's just that In the past week I have seen pictures of sunflowers, actual sunflowers(inside..it's February in Canada), found a package of sunflower seeds, had emails about sunflowers , discovered Michael Jackson loved sunflowers, and it seems, everywhere I look, there they are! It got a little creepy when I started reading a Stephen King book, Bag of Bones, and low and behold, there is an important sunflower reference. I don't know what it means yet, in the book, but it's Stephen King. It means something.

What this means for our zombie scenario is that, for all their ferocity, zombies aren’t going to last very long or do much damage before they render themselves inoperative. They can be shot dead as easily as anyone else (bleeding out will kill them, too), they can drown, they can suffer debilitating injury, they can be beaten unconscious (with sufficient head trauma), and so on. Furthermore, since they can’t feel pain and their survival instincts are removed, they are far more vulnerable to simple things we might not consider. They don’t blink–blinking is a pain response to dryness in the eyes. The result is zombies will let their eyes dry out, hampering their vision (remember what I said about blind zombies?). They could be influenced to stare at the sun, for crying out loud. They don’t rest, meaning they are going to exhaust themselves, cramp up, run their feet raw until they’re bleeding, leading to infection and death. They could die of exposure (from heat or cold), dehydration, and all that other stuff that our very useful brain ordinarily wards off as a matter of instinct. Killing zombies would be arguably easier than killing regular people, since regular people would know not to walk into potentially deadly hazards and would periodically stop to rehydrate.

No more; and by a sleep to say we end
My new normal is for me to live with the reality that I am an imperfect being, and accept that my body does get tired. I've come to accept that no amount of supplements, eating organically, drinking Yogi green tea, and even getting an adequate amount of sleep along with exercise can change what God has already spoken in Ecc. 3: "There is a time for everything under the sun."
As we begin to awaken to what I call the “Authentic Self,” or evolutionary impulse, and begin to identify more with that than with the individual and collective ego, the motivating forces for our choices and actions begin to shift. The goal in “Evolutionary Enlightenment” is for the individual’s center of gravity or locus of identification to significantly shift so that the influence of the “Authentic Self” becomes greater than that of the ego. But until this critical threshold is crossed, talking about intuition is a dangerous business.

I get occasional emails from writers requesting reviews. Although I read nearly all of these, my time for the past few months has been very limited. Even now that school and placement are officially over, I'm catching up on a lot of things, including a TBR pile, so I'm extremely picky about what I request.
I do not have the time. or, the ability. or the know, really.
Another benefit of this limitation is that it puts us inside the media body that in a typical horror flick would conveniently contextualise the mayhem with an explanation of the source, and provide an arrow toward the survivors’ solution if not the solution itself. Here, they desperately try to put together disparate reports into a coherent story to tell (because it has to be a story to be news, not just isolated facts), while debating whether they should be repeating any of it on air. Is it true, is it a prank, is it in fact life-and-death real and could get them fined for accidentally broadcasting the inappropriate reality of madness and death?
When we were in Maine, we all had great fun rediscovering some of our old favorite children's books.

How can a mere, ignorant child know what they wanna learn? Ya can't know what ya don't know, right? This is an absolutely sensible and valid question. However, it is one level (at least) too shallow. The more important question is: What is the core purpose of any education? Why are we learning, even in general, beyond the specific task of learning a particular thing. Before you can ask questions about which things are important to learn, you must ask yourself why. Predicate your phenomenology. Elucidate your epistemology. Tally your teleology.

We sat talking and smoking for a couple of minutes. I became a blabbering fool and basically spilled the beans on not only the evening, but the entire situation. He played the game and told me that I deserve better. That I'm beautiful. That my hair smells amazing. He touched my knee and leaned in to kiss me. I let him and one-upped him by pulling him closer to me. He took me inside and we found a dark corner right outside of the lobby and made out for about a half an hour. I know that he saw me as a vulnerable female - as someone he could probably fuck very easily - but at that moment, I needed what he was giving me...knowing it would go no further.

It truly pained me to acknowledge and write about violence against journalists and intellectuals in Tunisia. The violence was perpetrated not only by religious sects, but also by police.

I have another blog entry in my head…the part about being committed to my children, to what their NEEDS truly are, and succumbing to my own selfishness. Relinquishing the vain parts of you that you don’t want to let go,saying peace out to the worldly things that I loved so much, the clean organized home with adorable décor, the fact that instead of sports , we do therapy, instead of Disneyland we look at parenting retreats for Trauma….letting go of everything else except what is healing, and necessary and letting go of all else. Clutter, Stuff, Fancy, Impressive, Perfection, has no room here, so we are cleaning house…we are choosing to be committed to healing, committed to kicking Trauma in the face, healing wounds, regulating the dizziness of pain, loss and fear…and the days we can’t do anything but breathe…well that is what we will do, We. Will. Breathe.

Arequipa was known as the White City originally for the Spanish white men that lived there. After a while the meaning switched over to the white buildings made of volcanic rock that decorate the plaza and its surroundings. The city is also home to Huanita, the famous Ice Queen. Typically the Incas did not sacrifice humans, normally choosing black llamas as the victim, however they did sacrifice about ten children that were the ‘chosen ones’. The most famous, the Ice Queen, was marched (not unwillingly) from Cusco to Arequipa and sent into the volcano to protect the communities from the Volcano Gods. She is special because when she was discovered her body was still fully intact with skin and hair because she was frozen. She is now on display in Arequipa. Unfortunately we didn’t get to see her.
While you are using the restroom, do various co-workers come in the stall and ask you to settle a disagreement or open a packet of fruit snacks?
Less than hour later he strode up to the door of the house where just a few days ago they had attended the ‘group meeting’, jaw clenched and fists clenched at his side. At the door he lifted one of those hands and rather than just a knock, he banged on the door both heavily and repeatedly until it opened. It took quite a while and the thought crossed his mind that the neighbors may call the police on him. That was something that he didn’t relish contemplating, but if came to that he told himself that at least it would serve to shut down this surely illegal operation. Even if he had been fully willing to take advantage of it himself just hours ago, this thing with the bum disturbed him quite enough for him to throw away the entire opportunity.

I cut the bird part of the Bird Branch die cut with blue Core'dinations Distress Cardstock. I sanded the cardstock to reveal the color core to give the bird some color variation. I inked the edges of the bird with Walnut Stain Distress Ink. I adhered the blue bird to the brown cardstock cut with the branch. For the bird's belly and beak, I tore a scrap of yellow Distress Cardstock. I laid the torn scrap on the die so that it covered just the beak and belly. After cutting the piece with the die, I inked the edges and adhered it to the bird. I used a black pen to add an eye to the bird. I adhered the bird on the branch.

And really none of these things are terrible
Almost every person I sit down with in counseling is suffering from the results of following their heart.
A while back I had asked for some guest posts and my lovely friend Linda from the blog Ciao Chow Linda has been gracious enough to bestow one upon me. I have been reading Linda's blog for years now and she never fails to delight with her travels and with her recipes. I hope you enjoy this post as much as I do.
For the rest of you, welcome. I was thinking about my fantasy baseball team last night. It happens every year. I come to that time a month or so into the season and I wish I hadn't signed up again. I've been playing fantasy baseball on Yahoo since 2004. I checked and I've had 37 baseball teams in those years. I've done pretty well, coming in first 10 times. The problem is, I always get the max number of teams and it gets to be very tedious managing them. Another problem is having players that are playing against the Rangers. I absolutely will not put my fantasy team above my real team. If Justin Verlander is on my fantasy team and the Tigers are playing the Rangers, I want Verlander to get rocked. Plain and simple.

7. Chris Jericho v. CM Punk for the RAW title in a Chicago Street Fight
Once upon a time I bought a sweet little hardy geranium. A pretty thing in a tiny pot. It did look cute planted in the sunny border at the front of the house alongside some furry Stachys and under the white Iris which grows so well there. I was a bit worried that it might be overwhelmed by both but no, it's held its own and as you can see the three plants are a pleasant combination in early summer.

This rose print cheongsam was actually a gift from Mr V and it's been in my wardrobe going on ten years. It was given to me around about the time the sublime film "In the Mood for Love" by Wong Kar Wai came out in cinemas. Who didn't swoon over Maggie Cheung's wardrobe of more than twenty, exquisitely tailored cheongsams in one gorgeous print after another? So you can imagine how delighted I was to receive this dress and I still love it to this day. Let it be said that Mr V is great at picking presents!

Kit and Rob enter the boathouse, and start to make out. As Rob gets Kit to the floor, Kit turns her head and sees Skip's corpse float by, underneath the boathouse. Rob runs outside and starts to yell at Skip, assuming that it's yet another prank. Here's my question: How would the killer know exactly when to release the body, if Rob and Kit spontaneously decided on that specific spot for their romantic private time? And if the killer didn't position the body to float by at that exact moment, what are the odds that a body that was killed ther previous evening would just remain in that area until someone happened upon that exact spot at that exact time???
Heavy Construction
Yeah. I'm positively giddy. Our bedroom has a nice big window, too. I positively can't wait to paint and decorate and get everything moved in. It's just a pile of boxes at the moment and we're still living out of our old space. We have to find a fridge and I thought I found something great on Craigslist, but the seller backed out last minute. GRUMP!
On the Friday morning I came too again and crawled into the garden to have a cigarette, where I promptly collapsed again. My partner was raging at me, but still I could not make any sense of what he was saying. When he bought me a glass or water I smashed the glass on the floor and tried to cut my wrist with the broken pieces, but I had not strength in me at all and just collapsed again. At this point my partner picked me up and took me to A&E.
Blazing through the first four or five levels had me thinking “Ha, maybe he just couldn’t handle the nub after all. Even getting the star coins had been a pretty straightforward affair (not counting when I had to look at an asshole toad in the distance through binoculars so he could throw a coin somewhere nearby). I guess they had to apply some purpose to adding those binoculars instead of a decent manual camera to the game, but I digress. The star coins serve as a nice incentive to explore each level a little more thoroughly than regularly. Sadly, I couldn’t help but think that some of these levels could have been expanded on just a little bit and treated like a huge course like those you might find in SM64 or Galaxy. Instead they’re treated more like classic Super Mario levels, with a time limit and a more direct path from start to finish than objectives.
Ever since I was in my 30’s I thought I had a book in the making about our relationship. The first working title was “When the old Bat dies”, but I kind of figured I’d have to soften that, I didn’t think anybody would want to read that. Over the years I’ve imagined writing this book, and started bits and pieces of it several times over. I called it “When the Old Bat Dies” because every time I’d think to myself “When will I ever feel good enough?”, or “When will I stop feeling invisible?” or even something as simple as “When will I be able to accept a simple compliment about my hair?” The answer was always, When the old bat dies. Both the writing and I were very angry for a long time and now that I’m on the other side of her death, I’ve spent some time examining what made her what she was. Tragedies in her own life prevented her from seeing anything other but herself in the mirror.
As the ideas in my head kept popping I got more and more excited. A phone call a few weeks ago made me realize that I needed to have more than just me too. I needed people that I was comfortable enough around to talk to, but I didn't want to have people in the studio and behind the microphone that were ultra green, and also, ultra nervous.

I thought about this a lot today, for a stupid reason: I renewed my passport. I didn't know that you had to turn the old one in to do so. I love my old passport, which I got right before I left the U.S. to study in England in early 2001. The 20 year old in that picture is so fresh faced and excited about everything. Why wouldn't she be? She was about to live overseas! She wasn't even a senior in college and didn't need to worry about what she'd do with the rest of her life.

I also had a lot of time to think...think about life (especially when you read a lot, and see how other people spend their days...fictional, but still...I also blog surfed, too!) I realized that while my life is a good one, I haven't been living intentionally, just living. I first started thinking about this when I read Organized Simplicity last November, and it's been in the back of mind ever since. We live, work, hang out as a family, I nag the kids to help me clean, we read together, play together, spend a lot of time together...but I need to start using my time wisely. I know that someday soon...waaaah...my boys and my girl will be young adults. It's time I really started thinking about that and weird to say, but I need to start getting them ready for the real world.

The problem I had while translating this book was that I need to switch moods every time I started on the next story. Each writer had their own voice, their own style, their own color. I found it rather hard to change a writing style in so short a time. Usually I follow one author’s style in a whole book, lasted for about a month at least, and before I continue working on the next book (by a different author) I took a day or two to ‘erase’ one particular writing style from my head. But for this book I had to do it continually, non-stop, for a whole period of translating.

There were other places to see, but it was getting hot.

I colored my digital Billy up with my Promarkers, with just a touch of T1 Copics to tone down the blue I used for his snowsuit. I wanted to use bright blue and orange together and then I found this paper buried in my stash - what luck! I used two light blue Color Box chalk inks together to sponge the background and then layered two pieces of white cardstock for the snow, glittering the edges with a combination of Stardust and Waterfall Stickles. The shadow under his feet is a bit of Promarkers in blue and grey with some Waterfall Stickles over it. The snowflakes are all Martha Stewart. The little ones are from the Aspen Punch-Around-the-Page punch. These are the positives from punching out on a blue card for another project. The sentiment was done on the computer. A bit of grosgrain in two widths was glued down first, then I used various thicknesses of foam dots. Billy himself has foam squares behind his head and upper body, but his feet are glued to the top snow layer. I thought the shadowing and glitter at his feet would make more sense with his feet actually touching the ground instead of magically hovering above it. LOL
Those of you in less affluent areas I am sure will understand. It must be such a kick in the teeth when all those hard earned taxes that you pay go to those who have not contributed a penny.
It turns out that this idea, in a very clever, very subtle way, has been around in cosmology and astronomy under the guise of a principle called the “anthropic principle.” That is, the idea has been growing among astronomers—cosmologists anyway—that the universe has a purpose. It is so fine-tuned, there are so many coincidences, that it seems very likely that the universe is doing something purposive, as if the universe is growing in such a way that a sentient being will arise at some point.
How, for instance, are we going to stably reconcile the conflicting imperatives of a first world democracy with respect for the religion that sustained us in exile? The Orthodox – increasingly ultra-Orthodox – stranglehold on life-cycle events cannot hold. And the ad hoc arrangements that have produced, for the first time in Jewish history, an entire demographic sector that has abandoned the religious requirement to join the productive workforce, cannot be sustained. It is as untenable for the willfully ill-educated, impoverished members of the ultra-Orthodox community as it is for the rest of the society that is resentfully supporting them.

At 6 feet 7, Courtney Walsh was not just any fast bowler; he was perhaps the scariest of the lot- the bogeyman of his generation. Express pace bowlers have a limited shelf life. In order to survive longer, they either drop their pace or reduce their workload. Walsh did neither. No other bowler has managed to bowl with such fierce pace and accuracy for such long on the international scene and that too, with such remarkable consistency. His untiring vigil earned him the world record for most test wickets in 1999 and he later became the first bowler to reach the mark of 500 Test wickets. In the ODIs too, he was a formidable combination of pace, aggression and accuracy making him one of the most economical bowlers around.
People around town had been saying that the last half hour of the episode was not what they expected, but was the meat of the show. At first, I thought another hurricane was coming, Rita or something, then I realized it was a flashback to pre-Katrina. I couldn’t help but travel back to before the oil, to when I still thought that Katrina taught us the toll of slow responses, the need to consider safety as more important than money (as shoddy levees led to the flooding, not the storm), that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I thought we learned to appreciate this region, to treasure and protect it. I thought we learned not to let profits and contracts count for more than human beings dying on national TV – slowly, painfully and needlessly.

"I think we were destined to have a business together. Our different strengths and preferences complement each other, and we are best friends who truly love working together. Despite the obvious desire we had to do this, we felt no rush towards action on it, since we were each still finishing our degrees, getting married, buying houses, and enjoying young adulthood. Our business plans seemed like something we’d do 'once we grew up' still, and we meanwhile relished our casual chats as young twenty-somethings talking about this sister business we’d certainly have, one day, and just how great it will be.

When you take risks and go out on a limb, there is always a chance of loss; that’s why it’s a risk. But the potential return on that risk can be priceless, giving you insights and victories that you would not have earned any other way. Such is also the power of destruction. For all of its wrath, it is also a necessary part of creation. It is a clarifying fire, that burns away all you thought you needed and held dear and leaves you holding onto only the essential; for where else does the phoenix rise but from the ashes? Theatre under fire may not hold the assurances that a built-in source of support and pre-determined level of success does, but it sure does feel more alive, more dangerous and worth every moment of it.

It reveals quiet a mouthful of information pertaining to the science of Forensic Ballistics, and creates the impression that certain observations were made by “experts” who attended the autopsies, and who also re-visited the actual crime scene. With reference to the two firearms that were found on the scene, the report creates the impression that either:

Back in the day, when I got to play as much as I wanted, our games tended to take on a depth of plot where political stories wound their way around the characters and wove their way into the fabric of the stories that occured between adventures. This made for a rich tapestry of kingdoms, principalities and various lands that was frought with issues both realistic and fantastic. We had betraying spouses, religious strife, ancient claims and destabilizing monsters all over the place.
If this tale of bank ineptitude in California is typical of what’s going on around the country, the real estate market is in for a rough ride. Banks can’t get their act together to accept short sales – sales that are less than what is owed – and end up letting the property going to foreclosure and then selling for less than was offered originally. Everyone loses: the home owner has a bigger liability, the bank has a greater loss and housing inventory remains on the market far longer than is necessary. Will the situation improve? Not as long as people like this banker are in charge:

“The name, also written as grispedde or crespelle, comes from the Latin crispus, a reference to the crisp texture these doughnuts should have. In some homes, they are called vecchiarelle—little old ladies—because their wrinkled surface resembles the skin of an old woman.

For dessert, they are typically dusted with sugar or cinnamon sugar or served with honey for dipping.”
What am I saying? Well, that Spike and Tyler are truly different filmmakers that make work that are equally as important in telling our story. Their work is a direct reflection of their backgrounds. Spike is a child of a Jazz music instructor and a teacher. He is a legacy Morehouse man, and not to mention he’s a New Yorker. While, Tyler Perry openly expresses his personal battles and experiences with molestation, homelessness and the gun-toting, Bible thumping, weed smoking, “Christian” relatives he put in a blender to come up with Madea.

I am also not sure when or where it happened, but somehow over the last few years I have developed common courtesy. I honestly never saw that coming, once upon a time I used to sleep over at a friends house and we would go skating around our neighborhood at 3 in the morning, not giving a single fuck about the sleeping people inside their homes or the poor security guards who already have to work night shifts and don’t need 15 year old smart ass back-talk when they do their job and ask us to leave what ever place of business that we were vandalizing. You know when you are walking around in the city and you hear the thunderous noise of kids on skateboards speeding down the footpaths, dodging people as they go? Or the kids skating in the carpark at the shopping centre without any thought toward your hard-worked-for car? I used to be that kid, and I was proud of it, but now I couldn’t do any of that without feeling like a jerk, what gives?
In America, I arrived in 2003 thanks to the financing of the Caisse des depots, for a big amount.

The Mighty talented Tom Palmer will also be there. I have to have him sign one of my favorite StarWars comics I have from when I was a kid.
And what’s more, the concept of just getting together as a group to enjoy good beer and fine food is gaining traction. Pubs are once more becoming community hubs in something of a cultural backlash against the soulless pokies-serenading beer barns. They are a meeting house where locals and friends can gather and share and converse over an ale. At every dinner hosted or attended recently strangers have turned to introduce themselves, opinions have been shared and experiences compared. New friendships have been made and contacts swapped. Beer is bringing them together.

Stir within your children the desire for education. This is the latchkey to success in life. And at the same time, teach them that as President David O. McKay was wont to remind us, “No other success can compensate for failure in the home.”1 President Hinckley (To the women of the church Nov. 2003)
The players for this game were great, and everyone had a lot of fun playing the game. Rather to my surprise, midway through the action, we were told that the game had won the award for the best game of the Thursday evening time slot. The presenter commented that it was all but unheard of to see a Napoleonic game where all the players were laughing and smiling! Must have been Tim Couper's dry British wit and non stop puns...

One other time I was questioned by police, on Thanksgiving Day. My friend Katy and I were sitting on the steps of a cathedral at the University of Florida. We were knitting scarves on that cool misty day, while others were with family eating a feast. An officer pulled to the side of the road and walked up to us, and asked what we were doing on campus. He knew we weren’t students. He radioed in that he was bringing in two girls, and I began to weep. Tears have served me well in these matters, but I really have never faked them. As tears fell on my knitting needles, I said, “What are we doing that is so wrong? It’s Thanksgiving, and we have nowhere to go, and all we are doing is knitting on the steps of a church. What harm are we doing?”
* If it's a school day the next day, I get out all the things our son needs to take to school and have them ready on our bench (the bench space in this kitchen is enormous) including his backpack, lunch bag, sandwich container, drink bottle, library bag. His uniform and shoes are always laid out ready to go too. This makes school mornings run smoothly if we are pressed for time. I do the same for my bag if I am heading out with the boys for the day making sure I have nappies, wipes, snacks etc all stocked in the bag we are taking out and about.

The danger here is that discussions of objects are implicitly governed by a prototype object that functions as the representative of all objects. Cognitive psychologists treat prototypes as specific examples that function as representatives of abstract concepts. Think back to the 80′s and the dire Reagan revolution. Many readers will recall all the talk of “welfare queens” that continues down to this day in discussions of social programs. Welfare queens were mythological single women on welfare who had multiple children (to get larger welfare checks, the story goes) and who used their money to buy expensive things like cadillacs. In short, the non-existent welfare queen came to function as a prototype or exemplary instance representing all people on welfare. This prototype caused much mischief in welfare debates and subsequent legislative reforms.
Why does the child have to handle change with logic and acceptance, while the parent can use emotion and resistance?

I didn’t feel comfortable writing that article simply because I know women who don’t particularly shine in that environment. Instead I’ll cover some basics women should remember when addressing men for any situation.
I immediately said who I believe the English ‘mentor’ is and there is a whole body of evidence against him. Maybe all that is left is for Breivik to give the man up himself and then the Norwegians have everything they need to get the real English ‘mentor’ and charge him for his role in the whole affair.

Ever since I visited Nashville last spring, I've been obsessed with the biscuits they serve at the Loveless Cafe. The Loveless was once a motel out in the country on Highway 100 at the northernmost part of Natchez Trace Parkway. But now it has been overtaken by Nashville suburbia, and the motel rooms have been converted into charming shops. Anne Loveless' original biscuit recipe from the 1950s is still used there today. I agree with Food Network that their biscuits are the best in the USA - even USA Today said that the "miraculously flaky and feathery biscuits” from Loveless Cafe, were “Nashville's second-most-important contribution to American culture". Jane and Michael Stern of Splendid Table fame even wrote a cookbook devoted to the Loveless, but you won't find the biscuit recipe in it. It's a closely guarded secret. Carol Faye Ellison, Loveless' legendary biscuit baker, even enjoyed brief fame before her untimely death by appearing on NBC's Today, Martha Stewart, Ellen, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Throwdown with Bobby Flay, CBS’s Early Show and many other shows baking biscuits. She never shared the recipe, however. The Loveless still serves the biscuits, but I understand Carol Faye was quite the showstopper when she brought the hot biscuits out to the many hungry patrons. I am sad I never got to see her in action.

What is even more troubling is what a second term of an Obama administration could bring. President Obama's admission to the Russians that he will have more flexibility in a second term can only be translated to "if you thought I was liberal in the first four years you haven't seen anything yet!"

We arrived bang on time and were greeted by the smell of freshly baked bread. It was lovely, but turned out to be a yeast infection Uncle Clint picked up in a Vietnam brothel in 1968 and hasn't been able to shake. Still, a lovelier couple you couldn't hope to meet, and we were soon being served something sort of brown and chewy, a meat of some kind, which they said they'd made in their bathroom. Jerky, possibly? Turkey? Turkey jerky? Dunno.

I found that when I feel better about myself, I don’t run to food to make me feel better. When I’m confident and secure in who I am I don’t need those other things, like food, to take away the pain of feeling worthless and ugly. I don’t have to hide from myself or others, I can stand up and stand strong knowing who I am, and for me it’s knowing who I am in Christ.
Now that you understand at least in principle that there are things which might be taxing some of your friends and forum-mates that you aren’t seeing (even if you are there while they’re happening), you need to start figuring out what exactly you’re missing. I’ll start you with the most famous 101-level explanation of what it means to have a thing we call “privilege.” It’s about white privilege specifically, but I’m sure as you read you’ll be able to figure out how it generalizes to race, gender, orientation, level of ability, and socioeconomic class.
In contrast, many nations in developed society see women’s education as vitally important. Women are always custodians of the nation; they universally provide some significant contributions to the nation and the wider society when they are educated.
Obama picks up Colorado +9 (Romney lost to Santorum here) (236), Iowa +6 (same logic as Colorado) (242) and Pennsylvania +20 (Romney does not resonate with blue collar workers) leaving Obama at 262, only 8 electorals shy of reelection.
One of the things that i thought was particularly cool about last years Festival was that Meno gave away the recipe for De Molens Vuur and Vlam and each of the guest brewers was invited to make there own version, and each version would be put to the public vote. This was won by Haand bryggeriet. Though my personal favourite was De Struise, with Marble and Alvinne in joint 2nd place. (As a side note Marble has made there version again and i am really looking forward to trying batch 2)

Home for me is the flatlands of the Cambridgeshire fens, a landscape which is far from commanding immediate attention. Wide, wet and as lacking in features as it is in contours, it provides in many ways the ultimate blank canvas against which to project the constructs of one’s own imagination. Much of the time, I never saw my surroundings at all.

Don’t worry. You end up doing so much more than you ever thought you would. You do not take the traditional route that you think you are destined for. You discover a fork in the road that you did not even know existed, and for your willingness to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves to you and your commitment to take a chance on the unknown, you are rewarded with a career filled with travel, excitement, and a sense of confidence in your abilities that will stay with you always. Trust your instincts because they have proven to be trustworthy and make sure you take risks, because they always seem to put you in the right place at the right time.

I have to admit, however, that it wasn't long before my comfy chair didn't feel quite so comfy as I was transported with Mike and his traveling companion, Sam, to the streets of Washington DC, Portland, San Francisco, Phoenix, and San Diego as they not only visited the homeless, but lived among them for five months. No, this isn't a novel...it's a true story of two mens' journey from middle class college students to choosing to live homeless and pennyless to learn "personally what it means to depend on Christ for my daily physical needs, and to experience contentment and confidence in Him."

Some of Romney’s many policy reversals have been overlooked in this campaign as old news, so I’ll just provide a brief refresher. Romney ran for statewide office in the Massachusetts twice, in 1994 and 2002, as a pro-choice candidate, only to become publicly pro-life in 2005, just as he was gearing up to seek the GOP presidential nomination instead of seeking a second term as governor of the liberal state. During the 2008 campaign he attacked various opponents for being for gun control, amnesty and campaign finance reform. Yet at earlier points in his career, Romney supported the federal “assault weapons” ban (and signed a state ban as governor in 2004), called the McCain-Kennedy immigration reform “reasonable” and “quite different from amnesty” and supported campaign finance reform measures far more draconian than anything in McCain-Feingold. During this campaign, he’s spent the last few weeks attacking his opponent Texas Gov. Rick Perry for criticizing Social Security too harshly, because he says it’s politically damaging to do so.

This life can be as a road along the sea, hugging the cliffs like curves hug a snake. The drive can be anything you want it to be, if only you know what you want and what you need. Driving with the top down at high speed when you feel confident, or maybe when you forgot where are the brakes, you round a curve at the bottom of the hill with the hood of the car pointing up and out over infinity.
"Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God." Titus 2:3-5, NIV
I think abusive relationships are really hard to write about because it's easy to get preachy or to go for the shock factor. Though Trip was incredibly abusive, I felt the author did a tremendous job of broaching the subject. We get snatches of Trip and Allie's relationship during the good times mixed in with the bad. As Allie fights to remember the night of the accident, she uncovers more details of abuse and a disturbing pattern of Trip's behavior that forces the reader to understand why she is so timid. Wrapping those good and bad relationship scenes in with the narration of the current time worked to move the pace forward and build anticipation as to what actually happened on the night of Trip's death. Since Allie truly doesn't remember it turns the book into a mystery about halfway through. Allie even questions herself as a suspect.
The creature had the body a large and brawny man with rough pinkish skin, a bulbous stomach, and a large snout with a curved yellow tusk. He wore thick studded leather armor, and in his right hand he carried a heavy knotted wooden club embedded with iron nails. His head was topped with a a forest of dense black hair cropped so it was flat across the top. His wide gaping mouth had thick red lips and large crooked yellow teeth, while the one tusk curled upward toward his snout, and ended in a savage point, speckled with dirt and blood. Most alarming of all were the creature’s eyes. Around his head were set twelve eyes evenly spaced, black as coal, forming a circle of dark wells beneath his crop of black hair which formed monstrous eyebrow. All eyes seemed to focus on Ishcandar.

I am sitting down to write - just to enjoy a few minutes. I wrote a novel long ago and never did anything with it. It's a beautiful story - the characters so real. There is one chapter that brings me to tears each time I read it...and that's pathetic because I wrote it, right? I'm thinking of posting it here. I once sent it to a publisher. A woman who worked there really liked it and asked for more chapters. I sent it...she asked for more. I sent more getting really excited that maybe they'd publish it.
Took the opportunity to hunt down another cache! LOL! Jordy found a gnome inside that he quite liked. Then we drove over to the other side of town to see the Ghan which was due to depart this afternoon. I was hoping to have a look inside the train but when we got there i think people were boarding so it must have been not far off leaving. Plus i will admit from the outside it did not look all that impressive. Not sure what i was expecting. Tim said "it's a train!? What did you think it would look like!?" I thought maybe flashier! ?? It did look nice though- as opposed to your regular Sydney commuter train. Nabbed ourselves another cache out near the station and then home for a quick dinner.

While other famous musicians of his generation would get their musical training in the traditional context of the church, James Brown would get his on the streets, where between jobs as a cotton-picker, coal-scrounger and shoeshine boy, he also danced and sang to attract clients to his aunt’s place of business. He honed his talents further in prison, where he was sentenced to serve 8-to-16 years for stealing from parked cars at the age of 15. An experience that might have broken another man, however, instead inspired Brown to dedicate himself to music. He did his first gospel singing while in prison, where he earned the nickname “Music Box” and impressed his warden and the Georgia State Parole Board enough with his seriousness of purpose to win his release after only three years. At the age of 19, a highly motivated, worldly wise and ferociously talented James Brown walked out of prison and began his climb toward music greatness.

I went to a workshop once and they say that a script version of your novel is a great outline, because you have a description of the world or characters, you know who is talking and you can get the character’s voice. You can have the action and see them act. It’s much easier to write in script form then novel form and you can use it as an outline later! That’s what I’m doing.

Given the current global economic and environmental climate, one cannot help but notice that tribes and countries led by women appear to be more successful in the humanitarian sense.

There were, no joke, over 100 e-mail addresses that I sent it too. How many responded? One. That’s right one developer. But, guess what? That one developer had his assistant set up a meeting with me. I walked into that one developer’s conference room today. And as I sat there explaining how I work, what I am capable of and my experience, I felt a strength within me that I haven’t felt in a long time. In fact, I think it was something I’ve never felt before. Confidence. Natural confidence. I wasn’t acting a part, I wasn’t signing up for something I didn’t understand, I didn’t have the attitude”Well, it’d be their loss”. I was poised, smart, just funny enough, asked questions, and I was honest. I was me and I was exactly what that one developer had been looking for.
In Dream Psychology Spiders are both representative of creativity and maternal incest (according to Freud of course). As Female Spiders often devour their mates, they are linked with the potential danger of sex and women. The she-spider like Shelob is that all-consumptive force of Feminine power that threatens male dominance and supremacy. The Spider is the Femme Fatale which frightened men during the Cold War.

Getting dressed is so much fun for Kira. Her closet feels like I have a princess to dress. It’s one of my greatest pleasures dressing her up so cute. The best part is she approves of the clothes. She stands tall showing me she feels pretty. She does her own accessorizing with glasses, headbands, and necklaces and then runs to the mirror to observe. No one has to teach a girl how to admire herself in the mirror. And the shoes, she really likes her shoes. Sometimes she will pick out her own “pretty” and it is usually any item of clothing or foot wear that has something sparkly on it.

When I got married neither myself nor my husband had a “last fling” and he had friends that told him it was because I was a bitch. Neither of us missed it! I don’t have low enough self esteem to tell him he couldn’t have one on the grounds that I though he would cheat on me, I know he never would. (And I didn’t tell him he couldn’t have one, we mutually agreed that it was a ridiculous tradition that neither of us wanted to be a part of). But of course he’s not a real man if he happily turns down getting drunk and celebrating his last days of “freedom” right before he gets married…

Stanford professor Laura K. Donohue in her book – The Cost of Counter terrorism: Power, Politics and Liberty- warns of the risks to fundamental individual rights when democracies establish counter-terrorist regimes. She discards the logic of governments framing their initiatives in terms of a choice between security and freedom and argues that loss of liberty is notnecessarily balanced by gain in safety. General Azazi’s strategy has been grounded on this principle: he has insisted that our security strategy must first protect our liberty.
I only stared death in the eyes a few times which is better than I had originally anticipated. We were told before class that if you ever began to feel overwhelmed, aka close to death, lay down and breathe before you consider running out of the room because your body will go further into shock from the drastic temperature change. Well it’s safe to say I spent most of my time lying down. I picked up right at the end to make it try to look like I hadn’t just flopped around for the past 15 minutes.
The March 2012 Budget has been proclaimed as a Budget for the Workers, but there have been no measures to support local economies. Instead, corporation tax has been cut, which will allow for the large corporations to continue to wipe out smaller businesses. Reducing the tax burden on the conglomerates only fuels the demise of local economies as supermarkets and large concerns drive all competition out of business. No measures were taken against companies employing staff overseas. The UK Establishment have no problem with corporations making vast profits by overcharging people in the UK for services which utilise people in far away call centres where they can be paid a pittance. This practice could be stopped overnight if the government wished, but it is not, simply because they serve the internationalists and not the people who elected them.

5PM - I GOT AN EPIDURAL!! I am terrified of needles, and really enjoyed my other two labor/deliveries with no pain meds. But, this time, I seriously felt much more pain earlier on. I didn't want to know anything about what they were doing to my spine, and I literally almost passed out right after he stuck the needle in me. Oh my goodness, though, how amazing it is to not feel ANYTHING! It was cracking me up to watch the monitor and see contractions happening rapidly and strongly, but not even knowing they were going on. "Better living through chemistry," as my dad would say.

In the year 2000, I turned fourteen. My brother Dan was fifteen. We were up in New Hampshire, staying at a timeshare owned by family friends. The month was April (because my parents are the kind of people who like to go on vacation when it’s cold and rainy. They think sunlight is boring). Dan and I decided to take a walk down the hill behind the house to the nearby golf course. It was dusk. We reached the bottom of the hill below the house and used a cute little wooden footbridge to cross the stream that separated the golf course from the road. Dan was in a golfing phase and I was in a wandering around the woods phase. On the golf course, which was empty, we meandered for a few minutes looking for stray golf balls (Dan) and daydreaming about running away into the forest with an Indian brave (me). Not much time at all had passed and I was reaching down onto the fairway for a golf ball when Dan’s voice came from behind me.
and we just... keep growing up.
"fuck, goddammit, shit"...just like that.

The recession, and especially predatory loans followed by predatory foreclosures, destroyed decades of slow erosion of racial economic inequality. Net worth of Black households plummeted to less than what it was in 1984, leaving average wealth of Black households at just 5% of that of whites.
I remember being 3, almost 4, and living in North Carolina for a few months while my dad was on temporary assignment with his work.
Thank you for your patience, and I'll see you all in a few weeks!
Having been badly wrong-footed by the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, and with Gaddafi's collapse exposing an awkwardly friendly British foreign policy towards a terror-sponsoring regime, there is an acute and perfectly understandable possibility that the people of the new Arab democracies, probably led by Egypt, will be distrustful of those Western institutions that continue to do business with the Middle East's remaining autocrats.
