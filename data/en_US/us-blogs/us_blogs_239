The date of Nietzsche’s birth coincided with the 49th birthday of the Prussian King, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, after whom Nietzsche was named. During the early stages of his life the land we know as ‘Germany’ was divided into smaller nation-states, of which the Kingdom of Prussia was a growing power. Nietzsche was in his mid-twenties to witness the victory of the 1870 ‘Franco-Prussian War’ (he served as a hospital attendant and participated in the siege of Metz, he witnessed the traumatic effects of battle, took close care of wounded soldiers, and contracted diphtheria and dysentery), and the subsequent unification of Germany in which King Wilhelm of Prussia became Emperor Wilhelm of the German Empire.

Jaap Groot - I like how intensely yellow these are but they don't look anything like the two-toned blooms in the catalog. The petal edges should be pale yellow or white and height description suggest 60 cm. Mine tops out at 45 cm but maybe it's a little too early to tell since they recently bloomed about a week ago. I'm still waiting on the 4th tulip - Florosa viridiflora - pinkish white petals edged in fuchsia with long greenish-yellow flames.

We begin this series on International Cuisine @ Home with my favourite of all cuisines, Italian. I will aim to feature as many cuisines I know and what one might stock in a home kitchen to reproduce these foods at home. Once you start to read a few of them, you'll find the ingredients will be very similar. It's usually the cooking process that determines where its from. I try to keep these basics in my larder, that span across a variety of countries, so I am able to have a variety of meals at home.

So they started off the night, with Knight. Gladys is a pleasure to watch, her facial expressions and performance quality are so endearing. It was definitely cool to see her dance to the music she helped create and make ‘classic’. The judges were cordial, but we all know that Gladys’ days on this show are numbered with the standard of dance that is required to win.
A law was recently passed in the state of Georgia forcing women to give birth to any fetus after 20 weeks. This law is to be applied even if the child is highly unlikely to survive outside of the womb or a stillborn. This bill is now being called by many the “women as livestock bill.” The name comes from a statement by a proponent of the bill state Rep. Terry England (R-Auburn). He stated that if farmers have to “deliver calves, dead or alive,” then a woman carrying a dead fetus should have to carry it to term. The bill was pushed through the Georgia legislature on the last day of session and it includes no exemptions in the case of rape or incest.

The Cedar Leaf Shawlette was one of those "have to" knit items. The yarn is absolutely luscious and I wish you could feel how soft it is. It is Madelinetosh Pashmina and is my all time favorite yarn so far. I have worked on this off and on for several months when I needed something mindless to knit. The leaves took concentration but the rest of the shawl was easy.
I first asked him about Woodstock, and he told us about what it was like being in a helicopter, flying high above all those concertgoers. He wove a good tale, being careful to include stories about The Who and Pete Townsend's bashing of Abbie Hoffmann off the stage. He said that things were good in The Band at that stage, and he went into talking about their life at the house called Big Pink, where so many great songs were written and recorded by them as a team (there was a typewriter set up there on the table, and they'd all take turns writing lyrics on it). But he then let us know that it was Albert Grossman, and by extension, Robbie Robertson, who were the villains of his life. He launched into a gentle tirade against Robertson--this was something that clear still stung--especially after I mentioned The Last Waltz. He didn't immediately demean the experience of filming the movie, but he did pipe up in other ways.

I have made many new friends, and I have lost a few old ones. I began the year by promising that I would not move house again, and ended up doing so… TWICE! There have been moments of sadness that have moved me to tears, and moments of joy beyond anything I had ever hoped to feel again. I have had weird weeks aplenty and times when I was allowed the briefest glimpse of success. There was a moment when I considered writing this blog off as one of the worst ideas I ever had, but perseverance and optimism won out, and it may well turn out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made in 37 years.

With this things in mind, I’ve decided to take a cue from Laura and her April Challenge, I’m going to be setting weekly goals. I’m sure some goals will stay the same week to week (e.g. tracking), but other I expect will change each week (e.g. pretty much anything fitness/ workout related.) I plan to set an average of 3 – 5 goals per week, and goals will be posted each Tuesday.

First, the First Amendment – I am a big proponent of freedom of speech. (Just look at this blog’s reluctant defense of Fred Phelps!) But let’s look at the real issue here. The relevant clause is “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech…” Over time, of course, court decisions have expanded (and limited) the power and meaning of this clause, but at the core, it refers to abridgement of speech by law. Many cases have upheld the right of employers to put restrictions on the speech of their employees. I am a government employee and my employer, the government, places restrictions on what I can say when I represent that employer. This is reasonable and right, even if it is difficult at times. I took my job knowing this was the situation. The same is true of Juan Williams as a news analyst. Feel free to disagree with NPR’s standards, but they are applying them consistently and fairly and Juan Williams violated them repeatedly.

If you’re looking for me between the hours of 7:30-10:30pm this week, you’ll find me on the edge of my couch with eyes glued to the tv. I’m completely hooked. I don’t know if its the excitement that surrounds the 4 eastern conference teams, the complete madness of how they’ve made it to this round, or the extreme likability of each of the players but I do know that the current Eastern Conference playoffs have not disappointed. Perhaps its because they are all so close in vicinity to each other or because the possibilities of the next round match up is even crazier to think about. Either way, I’m obsessed.

In the final match to be played Sunday afternoon, Flemington went on to win their third straight game of the season; this time over the local Gothams. MELKY was the winning hurler against New York. Melky was a formidable striker as well, batting 4 for 5 against Bugs and the Gothams. As mentioned, there was superlative play in left from Peaches. But Illinois over at first base demonstrated soft and sure hands all day as well. In all, the Neshanock Club won the day in convincing fashion indeed.
The bassist and backup singers may look too young to vote, but newcomers T Bird & the Breaks are old souls bringing serious R&B heat.

Slight white lacing. Super malt/bread smell and the taste coincides with the aroma. Very easy and light flavor of malt, earthy with some slight citrus (bitterness is almost completely non-existent).

You can control everything you do and it’s simple. It takes a third party distributor to sell on iTunes or Spotify and there are all kinds of delays and hurdles built into the process that make the supply of an abundance of music difficult. I think this is a rather old-fashioned way of doing things – restricting supply to artificially inflate price – so I like that you can record a song in the morning and sell it on corporate that afternoon.

What do you listen to in the car? "We don't have a car, we haven't had one for twelve years and rarely travel in them.

That's when the old electric folk mix tape comes out."

Alex is useless in these situations because he starts sputtering indignantly but laughing at the same time, so the only thing he accomplishes is confusing everybody about his feelings.

I know it's been a long while, and after I had taken a break I fully intended to start blogging again. Unfortunately things went to Hell in a handbasket. My father passed away on March 19, 2012. I went to check on him, and found him. I wouldn't want to wish that on my worst enemy. I called 911, but as I suspected it was too late. I trained to be an EMT, but some things they just can't train you for. The Parademics, and EMTs that responded were very professional, as well as the LEOs. Of course the police questioned me, and looked around the condo. The ME questioned me over the phone, and asked me if I thought his death was due to natural causes, and I said yes. So he didn't come out to investigate, and just sent a team for a pick up. It had figuratively and literally turned into a dark and stormy night, so the ME didn't want to get out in the storm. I don't blame him.

This is a woman who just wants to be able to resist that controlling male domination, to assert her own rights and her own individuality. An important thread that winds through several of these conversations is the concept of owning one's self. The driver does not want to "belong" to a man or anyone else, and she doesn't want to feel like she belongs to her son either, like she has to foresake everything she wants to do in order to care for her family. The woman is based on Akbari's own character, and like the actress playing her, she's a creative person, a photographer and painter who travels and works a lot and thus can't always spend time with her family. Her son obviously resents her for this, and despite her attempts to explain her decisions, he remains convinced that she is simply selfish for wanting something for herself, for wanting a life beyond the home, beyond childcare and domestic chores. There are several conversations with Amin spaced out throughout the film, and in the later ones, after he has moved in with his father, he seems slightly more relaxed, less prone to anger, but sadly no more accepting of his mother's life and desire for self-definition.

In the enactment of emergency police measures, the questions as to whether an emergency exists is primarily for the legislature to determine.

When it comes down to it, we either submit to God's will or we reject it. Oftentimes, it isn't that we don't know God's plan for us, we simply don't like it. This is because we feel entitled to a good life and get confused when things don't turn out the way we want them. But, if anyone was entitled to an easy life, it was Jesus. Instead, however, He submitted to the Father's will and won redemption for us at a tremendous cost to Himself. So well-said. A bit of a "lightbulb moment" for me.

New spring bird arrivals: yesterday I spotted my first great blue heron of the season (flew right by my office window), and today, four wood ducks in a pond along the trail. The wood ducks' timing could not have been better. I was specifically looking for them at this pond, as they love to hang out here, and I figured they should be back soon. At that moment, I actually heard them before I saw them. Almost on cue, their familiar whistle echoed across the water as they flew over my head and coasted into the pond. It was uncanny. They are such gorgeous birds! Great to have them back

According to neighbors, Owens told some black kids to stop running through his yard. The kids called Owens racial slurs and then left. A short while later 4-5 cars pulled up. A huge mob of black men, women, and children spilled out of the cars. They were armed with a baseball bat, brass knuckles, a pipe. Others picked up chairs and paint cans. Owens was beaten, nearly to death, on his own front porch. His sister, who was inside, estimated the mob at twenty people. Another witness, who lives across the street, says there could have been as many as forty.

How much more reliable are reviews?

Proper document transfers are critical to investors because if there are defects, the trusts, which act on behalf of investors, can’t foreclose on borrowers when they default, leading to losses, said Beth Kaswan, an attorney whose firm, Scott + Scott LLP, represents pension funds that have sued Bank of New York Mellon Corp.

It is noteworthy that an emergency exemption is not easy to obtain and it is rarely granted. In fact, when we first raised the issue with our peers at the national level and in other states we were told it couldn’t be done. We are extremely grateful to Representative Mallory in the House (and State Senator Kearny) for taking the time to understand this difficult issue. In fact, Ohio has become a leader in this discussion and again, we are very appreciative for Rep. Mallory and Senator Kearney for their help.
What did I tell you. I told all nationalists on this blog what the election results for the BNP would be, and I also told Griffin, in my resignation e mail to him. Its all online, have a read of what I wrote. I could also define exactly how British Nationalism can rise again and what is required for us to start the movement moving into power, but until the present idiot leadership of all the 'Nationalist' parties are either removed or resign, then I will not detail how to do so. They dont deserve my ideas and support. The Nationalist movement in Britain is a pathetic disgrace. The primary fault lays not with the idiotic and incompetent 'leadership' of the parties, they are merely the symptom of the problem - the primary problem lays with the nationalists in the movement itself. Nationalists have become a cabal of pathetic cult of personality idiots, drones that can no longer act or think for themselves. They follow leaders who lie to them. They are willing slaves to liars, complicit in the crimes of their masters. They vote for the leaders in the parties and keep them in power, and hence they themselves are ultimately the real problem the movement has to face. Vote monkey, get monkey.

To finish, a confession: I sometimes embark on books from the classics shelf with a some trepidation: Will something in the old-world language, context or sense of humour be lost on me, so that I am unable to give it the appreciation it purportedly warrants?

Yet the children, who by chance of Birth, have anchored their parents, and often their grandparents to our country, are no more part of the indigenous people of Britain than I would be Czech had I been born prematurely whilst my parents were enjoying a City break in Prague.

The passing of empire lapsed into the chaos of the Sino-Japanese War and civil war between the Kuomintang under Chiang Kaishek and the Mao Zedong-led Communists. Xi'an was insulated from the worst fighting, suffering only a few light bombing raids by the Japanese. The city was, however, site of a curious episode known as the Xi'an Incident. In 1936, while staying at Huaqing Pool, Chiang Kaishek was arrested by his own troops and forced into a short-lived anti-Japanese alliance with the Communists. By 1949, Chiang had fled, the Communists were victorious, and the PRC was founded.
My mom and I stood in line for about 30 minutes waiting to get a chance to meet Lisa Scottoline. I used some Jedi mind tricks and some old school "my mom has a condition" tricks to get us through the line a bit quicker. My mom was absolutely ecstatic to meet Lisa Scottoline, she was grinning from ear to ear. Lisa was so awesome taking her time to chit chat with my mom. My mom beamed the entire time.

The same ‘coalition’ of Islamists and the Empire has been glaringly obvious during the NATO assault on Libya and continues against Syria: The Muslims provide the shock troops on the ground; NATO provides the aerial bombing, funds, arms, sanctions, embargoes and propaganda.

This is probably the most famous of the many slogans that were plastered up everywhere in Fascist Italy. It too has a resounding echo among Leftists today. I can think of examples where modern conservative politicians have apologized and retracted their views but I can think of no example where a Leftist has. In the old Soviet empire there was virtually no such thing as "negative" news reported in the media. Even plane crashes were ignored. And as Amis (2002) notes, even though the reality of the vast, destructive and brutal tyranny of the now collapsed Soviet regime is undeniable, Leftists to this day are almost universally unapologetic about their past support for it and may even still claim that Lenin was a great man.

This morning was Nate's Kindergarten Orientation. He got to see his new classroom, meet his new teacher, see his new classmates. He said he liked his teacher and that the playground was right outside his classroom, but he is shy with his new friends. :) I assured him all the other kids were probably feeling shy too, but after they all got to know each other they would be good friends.

We got to Deeside and the rain was off and on. We spent some time walking around the Deeside community promoting our VBS and passing out survival kits (toothpaste, deodorant, tissues, etc) to the locals. When the rain stopped, children came out one-by-one with to play futbol. Who wouldn't like soccer in the mud? We spent about an hour with the kids playing with them and promoting VBS. I think our efforts will pay off on our first night!

All of a sudden, the race was on to complete your album. Double after double, piece after piece. Former commons became rare, former rares became wallpaper, but the true ultra-rares finally became apparent. By the end of the year, three of us had near complete albums. Only one sticker remained elusive – number 33.

And then the rehabilitation process set in. I spent another week at the Neuro, being well taken care of by the nurses and having access to my Neurosurgeon on a daily basis, as it was crucial to have the implants calibrated. They then called a code purple, which at the MNH, means that they’re at 200% capacity and to empty as many beds as possible. I wasn’t quite ready to go, but I knew enough to know that staying in a “non-ambulatory ward” was more detrimental to me than rehab at home. This meant I couldn’t even transfer from my chair on my own. There is a simple truth when it comes to MS – you don’t use it, you lose it, and here I was for 2 weeks, not even able to shower on my own.

I've been covering TV a pretty long time now, and I honestly cannot remember anything like this happening before. Hell, most of the time it's a chore just to get a network to acknowledge that a show's been canceled at all. It's a testament to just how good "Terriers" was - and to how candid and self-reflective Landgraf is - that this thing happened.

It was a rough day to say the least, I'll save you on the not so pleasant details but let's just say he was out of commission for about 5 hours at home before we finally realized this was out of our hands, and off to the hospital we went. After lots of fluids, and potassium replenishment we finally headed home at 5:30pm. It was a long one, I tried to be the best nurse I could, we read magazines I did my best renditions of my favorite Christmas carols, I read to him the story of baby Jesus, I rubbed his shoulders and bought him an army load of Gatorade once we were finally discharged.

I hope all is well wherever you are. It has been a mix of rain and sun. I also have had this crazy bluebird that spends his days flying into my living room window or patio door. It actually, after a week or so of it, is getting annoying.
Yesterday I got an envelope from 123stitch.com and a small box from Barnes and Nobles. Last Saturday the 5th I received a box from Barnes and Noble. Of course there were charts in them. Lots of dragons and other mythic and amusing subjects. Today I received another envelope from 123stitch.com, it had the one chart that was back ordered in it. Yesterday I received a second box from Barnes and Nobles and it had the stitching cards book in it. I just love getting stitchy stuff in the mail! It makes my whole day!

After the announcement that Gingrich would drop out, I exchanged emails with a politically and religious-minded friend, asking if he would now be supporting Ron Paul, since his other choice is a Mormon, a religion he considers false. His reply was predictable, and underscores a paradox that this two-man Republican primary is set to expose. My friend said he would probably support Romney because he is “electable,” indicating that the higher imperative here is to beat Obama.

It had been a long, long time since I had thought about Samuel's casket. I hate thinking about it, and I have purposefully avoided going there in my mind. Seeing it when we went to the graveside was one of those moments that will be forever etched in my mind, walking up to the plot and realizing my baby was in that tiny box. Euh. It turns my stomach even now. And the thought of his body in there is almost unbearable for me. For several months I felt haunted by the image of Samuel in varying degrees of decay. In fact I had horrible, horrible nightmares about it for awhile -- ones that nearly made me throw-up in my waking hours and still physically bring on shudders. Samuel's body in that box is just one of the things I don't think I will ever be ok with. It's one of the reasons that visiting his gravesite is so unappealing to me. I prefer to remember my baby boy as I knew and loved him in his best days -- or even in his worst and sickest days over thinking of him buried under the ground in that tiny coffin.

The good news is that no money had been stolen. The bad news is that somebody won’t fess up to breaking the piggy bank. The possibility of it being the kids seem slim. Jade has no incentive to do it (we never replaced the money that was stolen from her last time) and besides, the girls are never alone in the house and have no time to break a piggy bank and clean it up so thoroughly that nobody sees any remnants. We would have seen traces on the floor and in the garbage.
As you can see, I’m excellent at reminiscing. EXCELLENT (I just like that word). But… sometimes I wonder if I’m missing/living in the past too much to enjoy the present? I have very real moments when I have to tell myself “Stephanie. Enjoy this moment. It will be a memory someday.” It’s tough. I just get attached to things/places/moments/people too easily. Ugh. Barcelona is a prime example.

I start by layering all my pieces on the page 1st, and then decided to free stitch some circles at either corner, so I lightly drew these on and then removed all my bits of paper (I only stick them down when I have to and am totally happy with where bits are). I just removed the foot from my sewing machine and then stitched away (it did take me the 1st circle to realise that I didn't need to actually turn the paper around in circles to stitch this way too!). I then inked, stitched and distressed all my bits of paper and started sticking them down. I made some bunting using the lovely chipboard pegs I have been saving, and made some glassine snow flakes. I also added some hand stitching to the hexagons too. I picked up some great arrow paper clips from paper chase...and they worked with my colour scheme (that must have happened subconsciously :D), as well as adding a Tim Holtz ticket tag for my journalling. The alpha is a mix of Amy Tangerines and Echo Park for the record's sticker sheet. My last additions were some flicks of white acrylic and red glimmer mist.

Inga (who as the title suggests), is a Viking girl from Einersfjord, Greenland & this book comprises 2 short stories about her. The first is called Inga Goes A-Viking & is about the village & villagers of Einersfjord, who are facing a very big dilemma. They are running out of supplies to repair their home & the merchant ships which used to stop in Einersfjord have stopped coming. The elders must decide what to do to save their town & make the decision to go A-viking – to return to their old way of life, raiding, to save their homes.

But also, I’m so happy to have found a little corner of the internet to discuss religion and history and cultural tradition. As an academic, it gets so easy to feel cut off, to feel like no one else will ever care about the things you love – I am so very, very grateful to have found that that’s not the case, that there are people in the world who care about religious law and transmission history and religious practice, to find people who want to talk (and to listen) about public expressions of religion, who don’t cringe when they hear the words ‘religion’ or ‘sharia’ or ‘Christianity’!
San Fran entered the draft with a team already capable of launching an assault on the division title and quite possibly the Super Bowl. With their first selection they acquired wide receiver A.J. Jenkins from Illinois. Jenkins was a surprise selection considering Randle and Hill remained on the board and the fact that the 49ers had already strengthened this position in the offseason with Randy Moss and Mario Manningham joining the team.
I haven’t watched a lot of Woody Allen films over the years, but from what I’ve seen they have some common themes. They are urban, conversational, quirky, and wholly lacking in pyrotechnics, which in my view is a pleasant change from the Hollywood convention of sandwiching spurts of plot-necessitated dialogue between explosions of all sorts. What I had not expected to find of Mr. Allen was a critique of a contemporary Evangelical Christian trend through the vehicle of a Parisian romantic comedy. I doubt that Woody Allen intended his movie Midnight In Paris to be a biblical criticism of this unfortunate trend, but good theology shouldn’t be ignored just because it was accidentally promoted. By the way, if I might turn movie critic for a moment, I give Midnight In Paris a thumbs up unless you are in the mood for balls of fire lighting up the sky.
11:00am. I was now on a long-distance bus that slowly maneuvered the many miles of capital city sprawl. Destination: the city of Oruro an easy three hours south. I hoped to arrive by 3:30pm in order to catch the train to Uyuni, a dusty town that bordered the world’s largest salt flat. Plenty of time, I thought ignoring the Van Dam movie explosions and gun clicks on the mounted TVs. Soon my world was a Radiolab podcast that comically explored the topic of chance. “What are the odds that somebody somewhere will win the lottery twice?…In Connecticut, employees of a place called Shuttle Meadow Country Club, they won twice. A man in Pennsylvania he won twice a few years later. A California retiree won a Fantasy Five and the Super Lotto in the same day. The odds of that were calculated at 1 in 23.5 trillion.” I fell asleep, cheek against the cold glass, slot machine numbers and the ghost of Butch Cassidy galloping in the distance.

In addition to that resolution I felt this new feeling, a feeling that came as a result of graduation. I felt like I was no longer preparing for my life, but actually living it for the first time. I felt like the things that I do now that I am not in school were the things the mattered. I had always been in school in some form or fashion and that was always in preparation for a "better life". But as of January, 2010, the preparation was over and the living had begun! I thought that I had better start living it because I was no longer waiting for anything.

Sunday was a wash. We went to church and were presented in front of the congregation along with 8 others to become church members. I'm not fond of standing in front of people let alone a sanctuary that holds 1,200 persons. Fortunately, we attend the 8am service that typically isn't full. Other than that we did a little spring cleaning of our office, I was able to edit 3 days worth of images (for this weeks posts!) and watch movies. We also built probably our last wood fire for the season. Maybe we can squeeze one more in who knows.

For almost a decade there were few people making music I enjoyed more consistently than Jay-Z, and for the later half of that time Kanye West was his biggest competition. My worship of them as artistically viable musicians still making great records ended a few years ago, though, and sometimes I wonder if it's afterglow or brand loyalty or something even dumber that's kept them still #1 and #2 in the hearts and minds of so many millions, still, after some of the garbage they've made. So I was pleasantly surprised to like Watch The Throne more than any album either of them has made since Graduation, mainly for "That's My Bitch" and "New Day" and "Gotta Have It," but even the lesser tracks aren't Blueprint 3 bad or anything. Shame about the Kanye honk, though.
Water spraying and the use of materials such as boron and sand would appear the most relevant. The risk is that, with water spraying on Fukushima-Daiichi unit 4 following a loss of the cooling water and even collapse of the building, this could make the situation worse – if the spent fuel rods have gone beyond 900 degrees then the water will provide further oxidation helping to release more radio-nuclides into the atmosphere. The zircalloy fuel cladding around the thousands of fuel rods at Fukushima-Daiichi ignites at 900 degrees and above – fuel melting as seen in the cores of units 1, 2 and 3 occurs at 2800 degrees.

With great writing, a strong plot, and a happy ending, The Duff delivers something for everyone.

I am feeling pretty sad right now. As you probably know, I’ve been a big fan of etsy for a while. I’ve had a love affair with shopping there, and I was super proud to have a shop of my own. Well, the love affair is over. If you haven’t heard about it, a few days ago etsy decided to promote a shop whose items that obviously weren’t handmade. The featured shop was in clear violation of etsy’s own written terms of use for etsy sellers. In response to public outcry, instead of apologizing, etsy has been deleting comments and closing discussion threads. Their only public statements on the matter have been frustrating non-apologies. So, after some unhappy thinking, I’ve decided to close my etsy shop. I’ll be moving my stuff gradually over to https://www.wepay.com/stores/yellowee-creations. I’m also having a 25% off closing sale in my etsy shop. If you’d like to take advantage of the sale, the coupon code is BBALI, which will be good in my etsy shop as long as I keep it open.

While perusing the blog over at Finding Wonderland, I heard that next week several websites will be participating in Steampunk/Alternate History Week, so I thought this would be the perfect time to declare my newfound love for all things steampunk.
God: “Horned one of the wilderness / Winged one of the shining skies / rayed one of the splend’rous Sun / Blessed one of Samhain cries- / I call amidst the standing stones / praying that you, O ancient one / Will deign to bless our mystic rite- / O fiery lord of the blazing Sun!”
You will be pleased to be reminded, also, that Blair and premier Wen Jiabao witnessed the signing of a €500 million loan from the European Investment Bank for the extension of Peking airport and that, during the meeting, a Joint Declaration on Climate Change between China and the EU was issued. This confirmed the establishment of a China-EU partnership on climate change.

We let the babies sleep in the car on the way over but they woke up right when we pulled it. Amelia knew it was fun time!! We went straight for the baby animals that were out! I wish I would have videoed her. All she did was say "awwww baby"! Cutest thing ever! I didn't let her hold any of them but she was happy just to pet and look!

We came across this eagle family and watched them for ages. I can't describe the feeling of seeing them swoop through the air, calling to each other. I had tears in my eyes....this city girl needs to get out more I guess!

So Halloween is almost upon us and it is time to finish up the kids' costumes. This year the kids have decided to be Magic cards. In case you've never heard of it, Magic, The Gathering is a card game that Jacob and I used to play back in our college days. We saved the cards and recently, during a hurricane power outage, we brought them out to teach the kids; something to pass the long days stuck at home.

Asking police officers to make these judgements about healthcare needs in dynamic, unfolding situations is not only unrealistic but potentially dangerous. When more is known about ED, we can look at this again; but until that time every police constable in the UK has the legal right – actually the duty – to ensure that prior to taking violent people to the police cells, that it is medically appropriate to do so to avoid catastrophe for patients and their families.
Even now we are praying for you here.
Seasons come and go and we are learning to expect bigger and more explicit messages. What surfaces above all is the sense of wonder they impart, to thousands who have never actually sat in one or experienced the sense of ‘community’ they intuitively bring to the fields. Many have only seen them from above: the photographic message, shared so willingly and selflessly by dedicated crop circle pilots and photographers and website volunteers. In a gentle, unobtrusive way, it seems that the symbols in the fields are encouraging us to reconnect with our own sense of community–and our own sacred selves.
On the flip side, here are some Things you WON’T regret:
Am I the only person old enough to remember a segment on Sesame Street called “Who are the people in your neighbourhood?”

Personally I tend to save up my outrage for the rainy days of innocent males shot by police while at home, local government forcing people from their homes to save a billionaire(no not that one) and of course ignorant sport stars who should at least try to avoid doing the stupid (too many to link to). But this image and how it can affect young people in that area is demoralizing and I think we should speak up about it.
And in the end God placed Joseph to be the prime minister of Egypt to save many people alive. Joseph had to travel the way he did to get to where he was. God used his own life experiences to lead him to the throne of Egypt. Not to glorify Joseph so he could have a thousand different tunics to wear but to save many people alive. God was thinking of everyone and Joseph was the instrument he used to accomplish his goal.
I hate to admit it, but if they pass the deceptively named “Student Non-Discrimination Act,” (H.R. 998 & S. 555) that’s exactly what they’ll do. Better named the “Homosexual Classrooms Act,” its chief advocate in Congress is Rep. Jared Polis, himself an open homosexual and radical Haters/activist.

When it comes to books on beer and pubs it is fair to say I have sometimes been a little less than kind. I mean what is the point? A guide book to pubs and/or beer? Wondering what a beer is like? Buy one and drink it. You don’t need a book. Decide for yourself whether it is any good or not by way of your own personal opinion after you’ve had a swig. Same goes with pub guides. Good god, what is the point? See a pub and unsure whether you like it or not? Walk in, if you like it stay, if you don’t walk out. Job’s a good ‘un. Who on gods earth needs a guide? Doesn’t seem to stop people knocking them out though.

“Mondays, eh? While you are here, the quarterly projections were in, but the data doesn’t stack up, I need you to look over this tonight,” he handed John the papers.
But you might want to take a long nap, at least 90 minutes. Many of us get about an hour to an hour-and-a-half less sleep a night than we need. One recent study shows that the sleep-deprived brain toggles between normal activity and complete lapses, or failures, a dangerous state of slowed responses and foggy inattention. Sound familiar?
I'd just begun sending out dummies of my book to potential agents when I was contacted by a publishing company specializing exclusively in ebook apps for the iPad. They had seen my work at a regional SCBWI event and wanted me to submit any manuscripts/dummies I happened to have for their review and possible acceptance. They went on, in that initial conversation, to say that if the app sold large numbers, it would make it potentially appealing to traditional publishers.

It’s the combo vaccines that must be purchased. While we have negotiated decent price breaks, we still have to raise the funds to buy them. Combo vaccines prevent diseases such as Distemper and Parvovirus, two huge canine killers that plague our region. For our kitty friends, the vaccines protect against feline viruses such as Rhinovirus and Feline Leukemia which is very similiar to human HIV.
As I said at the start of this post, it is only April and there is much track and field left to be run. But today did prove two things. 1) That having one great meet does not make for domination. 2) As I said in a previous post, there's no need to panic over US sprinting!
PS. Just some additional ‘technical’ details for those who may be interested. For people who haven’t danced to places with very good tango (for me Italy from Rome and to the north is the reference in Europe) the level of the dancers and the quality of the ‘circle of dance’ will be more than satisfactory. Some criticism is that many people dance more open embrace, a style not so of my taste, which also makes couples occupy more space, a disadvantage for the crowded hours of the milonga. Also some dancers (among them several high level ones indeed), weren’t so respectful for the rest and moved in a rather ‘chaotic’ way, making co-existence quite difficult. But in general nothing reaches really disturbing levels and the milonga flows all the time…

At about the two-mile mark, you will come to a fork in the trail. If you go straight you will follow a small loop that includes several banked turns in and out of a small ravine. (The trail to the right at the fork is a more direct route, but either way you go the two paths soon rejoin each other.)

“The atmosphere during the working rehearsal on Wednesday 21 March is very different from that of a performance day: a mixture of concentration, tension and excitement. Downstairs, the auditorium is reserved for the professionals; dancers, musicians, journalists and technicians inhabit the space. An improvised working table, huge in its dimensions and packed with computers, lamps and notebooks, is installed over the seats of the central rows. From there, the light and sound teams make the final adjustments. A few rows in front, the press are ready to take the pictures that will illustrate the opening night reviews. No detail will be missed by their telescopic lenses.
Many people concerned are not sufficiently informed about their disease: Therefore, the fear of suffocation determines their whole life. The most common reasons for an asthmatic attack are allergies, not-allergic stimuli such as smoke or dust, and also physical effort. Right medicine, as well as breathing therapy, and sports help asthmatics to handle the disease. In physiotherapy the patients learn to focus on their body and to control their breathing. Breathing exercises, relaxing techniques, and specific muscle training strengthen the respiratory tract.

I like the fact that John says none of the changes will cause the manuscript to be rejected, but he will do them anyway. I would probably do the same. An editor reads way more books than I do, and knows what works and what doesn't. Especially as a first time author I'd probably do every one of them without question.
'OH MY GOD....AM I REALLY THINKING THESE WORDS!'
Almost giving up, I assumed a squat position as I knew this usually attracts the dog’s attention. She duly did the tongue thing again and ignored me completely! WTF was I doing? I felt like I was making a complete fool of myself. A guy who can’t keep a simple leash on his dog. He must be retarded! (Ignore the pun if you noticed it). I felt like a real idiot as I squatted there whistling nervously, to an unconcerned mutt.
That said, referring to an earlier post I made about Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, (no stone is left unturned here) I have finally read the book, enjoying it thoroughly! I have laughed out loud on the London Underground at parts of the story (mostly the zombie invasion and sexual innuendo) though I'm not sure what Austen would have made of this adaptation! I bought the deluxe heirloom edition (and feel rather posh for doing so dahlingss) complete with paintings of vital scenes in the story. Nice!

Hope everyone is having a great week so far! Thank you all, for the interesting diversity of opinions in my last, last post in response to the article I linked titled the "Beauty Blogging Effect". I really do love intelligent debates and hearing about other people's thoughts and perspectives (oh gosh I sound so much like my uni lecturers lol).
Phreak: Too soft a punishment for this grievous offense. We need something more severe.
There are seven books total in the series. The Terrestria Chronicles allegory series was written with a three-fold purpose: to honor Jesus Christ as King, to challenge young readers to love and serve Him, and to teach them to guard their hearts for Him. These books are much like Pilgrim's Progress geared towards ages 10-14.

Once you list your name, address, place of birth, date of birth, hour of birth and minute of birth (she tactfully omits “method of birth” and “number of minutes umbilical cord was wrapped around your neck”), you’re pretty much done. All that’s left now is to wait for a few days, and watch the mail for that large white envelope containing your secret instructions. “Read them carefully,” she writes, “and expect to see some big changes in your life after a few days.”
Getting closer to Hashem means becoming a more divine-like individual, just like getting closer to another person means developing communication and similarity. The way to come closer to Hashem is through keeping the mitzvot, emulating Hashem’s middot, and attaching oneself to people who are already on the path to greatness.

I am linking up with Oceans of First Grade Fun to talk about this topic. I was thrilled when I saw this because this is one of my summer dilemmas. Our principal bought us this great Calendar Activity Chart to use in Kindergarten. I used it this year but was quickly bored with it, not to mention it was HUGE!!!!

No matter what you let in your home, your kids are going to experience violent video games. They are also going to experience bullying, bad teaching, parental mistakes, and sometimes tragedy. They might even fall down a few times or break an appendage, and quite possibly hurt another child. These experiences will shape their world. Being a good parent isn't just about shielding them from these experiences and protecting their innocence, it is about helping them cope with what they've seen and experienced. The faerie tales from The Brothers Grimm are exceptionally violent, but are housed in a context that allows children to safely experience them and assimilate them into their world. No one is trying to put out legislation to edit the Brothers Grimm, yet for a young child with an active imagination, this represents as violent an experience as any. The fact that it is being read by a parent, a trusted figure, and the children are in the safety of their home and beds, softens the experience.
If you haven't signed up for Groupon....you should because it's amazing! Everyday there are amazing deals all over the country.

Innovation trumps capital. Growing momentum for startups and venture funding is translating into an environment where ideas and the ability to execute them trumps the size of your bank account. Small companies are poised to be the rock stars of the near future, due to the fact that they can execute faster and access infrastructure at increasingly lower costs. Since commercial funding will continue to be limited, innovation capital will be the name of the game.
So does he see the day when he would align himself with a larger publisher? “Not at this time. These are very tough times, I want to be very clear. And were it not for the other entities we’re involved in, it would be difficult. The events that we have. The internet, which obviously is a big thing and which my son is still explaining to me how it works, in terms of why it will make the money that he thinks it will.” (Mr. Graves has three sons in the business.)

I received my ATCs in my little swop with Jordan at the weekend (above). I love them! The Easter Meer-bunny is just perfect- you may remember that I stitched the same design for a friend's Easter card a few weeks ago, so I'm delighted that Jordan stitched the design for my ATC as now I get to keep one too! Jordan also sent me an ATC which she had designed herself called 'American Diner', how cool! They both make excellent additions to my ATC collection, thanks for swopping Jordan!
The NotW paid witnesses. There is no dispute about that. However, as I understand the time line, this was not once criminal proceedings against Tommy Sheridan became “live”. Newspapers pay for stories. The fact of payment being made to witnesses is important, as long as it is disclosed. In contrast see the mess arising from the payment of a “reward” to Mr Gauci, the vital witness in the Lockerbie case.

As our unit is large and employs many nurses, we have two representatives, one from the day shift and one from nights. It should come as no surprise to my friends that I'm taken on this role; I tend to be an enthusiastic change agent.

The government is set to unveil new measures to further limit public spending as part of the government’s efforts to meet its austerity targets. Under the new rules, government departments will have to set aside 5 percent of their annual budget to cover unexpected expenses in a bid to discourage them from asking for more money from the central government when emergencies arise.
I also spent a lot of time chasing two chickadees around in one of the flowering trees. I have been trying to shoot photos of birds in with the flowers, but so far this year, I have struck out. The stupid chickadees would perch in a great spot, just long enough for my auto-focus to almost get a focus lock, then flit off before I could shoot. When they did sit still, it was in a bad spot where I couldn’t get the flowers in the frame at the same time. This is the best I could do today.
My daughter posted on her blog last night: “In terms of myself, I am trapped in a state of limbo; mentally in a place that continues to destroy me both inside and out. I feel powerless when it comes to the notion of regaining life and freedom, happiness and contentment. It is a dark alley way and although there is a light at the end of the journey, it appears so dim. “

Much of my work over the last several years has involved attempts to measure intercultural competence. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) is one indicator I have used extensively. (Read more in “Research and Relevant Bits” here on the www.interculturaleyes.org site.) Based on the Milton Bennett theory of how cultural sensitivity is developed, I am still convinced that the IDI provides a relevant marker and profile for the way that a person experiences cultural differences. The Bennett theory includes strategies for moving from one developmental stage to another, and from my own experience in working with training programs, I am fully convinced that motivated people can be “taught” sensitivity through guided reflection and by calling their attention to the way in values and habits have been developed within their own culture. But the key word here is “motivated” and it’s much less clear how that motivation is developed.

I have used origami to entertain people in several jobs I have had. I worked at Southwest Airlines and would make a crane, use a marker to make it look like Shamu and present it as a trivia gift to a grateful passenger. The origami Shamu-crane would then allow them to pre-board the flight. This was years ago…I don’t think that would fly now!
Favorite Quote: “Every day you get a chance to stay the same, take a step back, or take a step forward.”
Nonetheless, giving the situation the benefit of the doubt, the bridge that divides African-American women to these clinical trials is a two-way street. Although it has been “found that people of color are less likely to be asked to participate in clinical studies” by HIV/AIDS researchers, and that health care organizations have not been “aggressive enough in recruiting black women,” many African-American women are skeptical of volunteering for clinical studies due to America’s long history of exploiting the African American race for so-called ‘medically-related’ purposes.
There have been Boston fans profusely apologizing for the actions of some fans who are probably not fans of the Bruins, or the sport. Not only that, some of Ward’s teammates, like Jeff Halpern took to Twitter to support their teammate.

Dave had quite a scare Monday night. He was refereeing a junior varsity football game at Camas High School and tripped over a player's leg. He went down hard, and landed on his forehead. He was treated by the on-site medic who was concerned that he might have suffered a concussion. No concussion, but Dave's little finger was jammed but not broken. He was deemed well enough to continue the game about 15 minutes later. By Wednesday, Dave was well enough to go golfing, so I knew he was on the mend. If you want to see the fall, the incident happened to be captured on videotape. Watch the white hat referee in the middle of the screen--that's Dave.

The super-workshop will be run in close parallel to the themes of a forthcoming exhibition that I am in the process of curating for the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno, called Landscape Futures: Instruments, Devices, and Architectural Inventions. That exhibition—on display from August 2011 to Spring 2012—has received grants from the Graham Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. Needless to say, I am unbelievably excited about the exhibition and will be posting more about it as the year develops.
Packing extra hydration or snacks is not just for the kids. There are times it can become a medical emergency. Blood sugar can drop or someone have have a coughing/choking episode. Having those essentials items can make a huge difference.
The front yard is now all mulched, weed and feeded, and mowed. The back is almost done - needs a few more bags of mulch and annuals planted in the newly dug out and dirt replaced area. We used the dug up clay to fill in under the back steps. The deck has been washed down, the storage shed straightend up and half a bottle of Advil downed. I maybe glad to be back at work to rest a bit. No, I take that back. I'm not.
So, in summation:
It was a frustrating night at UFC 137 for most readers of this blog. Jacoby had a decent first round, where he got the better of the stand up, but gave up a take down in the last 30 seconds which probably cost him that round. The following two rounds he fell victim to Starks strong take downs, and was unable to work off of his back. Additionally, I would say that Dustin was less aggressive than he has been in previous fights.
Her rump is really sloping… which to me is less than ideal, but she has good legs and the rest of her frame is nice so I am hoping she will end up throwing some good looking kids. And although she was completely terrified at first, after Pumpkin proved we were harmless she ended up really warming up to us.
Home Depot had to be the answer (as usual). I bought some Plaster of Paris and drywall tape and applied another layer of tape and plaster on both sides. After a couple of hours in front of a fan, it was stiff and dry.
This week I went to the photographer's studio to have my photo taken for the publicity for Skylight. I have never sat for a professional photo before and found it to be an unusual experience. There were lights upon me from many angles, and a silvery space-age contraption that looked like it had been designed by NASA, was stuck under my chin. The resulting photos, however, made me wish I could take all the lighting and photographic paraphernalia with me everywhere I go, as they clearly work miracles. Once the poster has been designed and I have a copy in my hot little hands, I shall scan it and upload it here so you can enjoy my discomfort. First rehearsal on Sunday - I'm feeling quite excited about it.

Everything about the show was beautiful. From the so gorgeous you could cry dresses, to the flowers– and little flower girls– even the always on point musical choices. I’ve long felt that Oscar can do no wrong, but seeing all the lacy, delicate and intricately detailed bridal gowns up close and personal just proved to me what a mastery the man has of his craft. Some of my other favorite designers still have occasional seasons of “misses”. But never, ever Oscar.

The road of this life can be so hard. I don’t understand why some spirits find it so necessary to manifest their own fear and pain by hurting others, but I pray that those spirits open to understanding, compassion, healing, and at last peace. Let their hands, hearts, and voices turn from cruelty to acceptance.
Wasting some time at a used bookstore the other day before work, I first saw the Cannon Pictures logo, then the MEDIA logo as I turn to the front.

I think these experiences are reasons why I have a cavalier attitude towards death, even though i feel sick when i hear of a death. Up on till a few years ago, I used to think that i may die young (I’m not so young anymore, so that feeling’s mute) and even though to some people that seems like a terrible thing, generally speaking – to me it doesn’t matter how old you die, what matters most is that you’ve accomplished your divine purpose. The way I see it, if you complete you assignment at the age of 20, excellent – you get the privilege to move on… where you go to is an open to debate, but judging by how Christ was dismissive about what happens to the dead, I don’t think I need to worry too much about what happens afterwards while I’m here.
Elizabethan age is known as an era of intellectual growth and Renaissance. Strangely enough the intellectualism led to the persecution of the witches and believers in the witchcraft.
I bring this up because I was a part of a group last night that seemed content with scraping by as long as they were comfortable. I was asked my opinion and as usual I tended to have a very different view of how life should be. David Deida, in his book “Way Of The Superior Man”, recommends finding your edge. Your edge is what scares you, what you think you cannot accomplish.. and then live just beyond your edge. There are many benefits I can come with not just for “Superior Men” but “Superior Women” as well:

The nine hour drive home from Nashville can be eye-crossingly boring. I reluctantly passed by Dollywood in favor of listening to the continuing saga of a Janet Evanovich audiobook. One McDonalds with Elvis all over the walls blends with another rocking chair on a Cracker Barrel porch until the Blue Ridge Mountains appear just in the nick of time. Only a sporadic NPR signal saved me from driving off a cliff.

Mi Roo thinks back to her last birthday. He had promised to take her out for lobster but had taken her out for crab. Instead of a nice restaurant, he took her out for street market dining. He had insisted that they tasted similar. Upset, she tells him that she’d been starving all day, waiting for a meal that was never going to happen. He had told her that he couldn’t afford lobster with his salary but promises that he’ll buy lobster for her next birthday.
The monks offer knowledge. Well, the monks are damned. You should know this now. The vultures will pick apart their damned bones, and we will toss them in a pot and I will show you real knowledge: how to read the futures, all of them, in the broken bones of broken monks. Is that not true knowledge? An education so fine has never been offered before, not by me. I have sons, thirteen, and not one of them can claim what I offer you now, child.

Well Siobhan Dowd's book was not so much "unfinished" as "unstarted." The central idea was there: a boy, whose mother is dying of cancer (the words "dying" and "cancer" are not used in the book) is visited by a monster - a kind of Green Man - who is going to tell him three stories. In return Conor has to tell him one. Siobhan had not written down what the stories were.

I keep finding myself wanting any team playing against City to win, just nick a goal and win it 1-0. Normally, the more devastating and soul-destroying the better. I’m not sure if it’s normal to have an irrational despise of a team for having money, but it’s definitely there. I didn’t take this sort of dislike to Chelsea when they had some money stuck in their hand. Might be because my Dad’s a Chelsea fan and didn’t want to upset him, he was on cloud nine.

Write an engaging opening sentence or paragraph about your book: Keep the opening brief, and focus on the conflict, suspense, or cliffhanger. A bad opening would be: “Laura lives with her mother and sister in South Dakota. She is eleven years old when her Uncle George comes to visit. He brings her a present from Australia. At first, Laura is shy around Uncle George but she soon warms up to him when she sees what the present is.” In other words, we don’t need a blow by blow description of the story’s opening. Write a brief cliffhanger or something that evokes mystery or suspense, such as: “Eleven-year-old Laura McAdams never knew she had an Uncle George until he showed up on her family’s doorstep one day with a gigantic present for her. Her curiosity over why her parents never told her about this mysterious uncle was only superseded by what could be in the box that was as large as her. When it turned out to be a baby kangaroo, accompanied by an invitation from her uncle to travel with him to Australia, Laura began the adventure of a lifetime, even though her parents refused to let her go.” The second example raises all kinds of curious questions for readers: Why don’t Laura’s parents like her uncle? How does she end up going on the trip if her parents don’t want her to go? Is the baby kangaroo going along on the trip also?

Topsy tracked 168 hashtag mentions, 120 on Quest day itself, which doesn’t make it a trending topic … but it’s probably about 160 more tweets than we’ve had about Quest in past years. The four videos may not have gone viral (I do hate that phrase) but garnered more than 550 plays and counting. I saw them widely shared around Facebook and Twitter as well. So while not everyone would consider these knockout social media statistics, they do represent a nice starting point for an event that hasn’t had much of a social profile previously. Moreoever, it shows it is indeed possible to build a social audience for an academic event, a nice finding in itself.

I don't have a journalism degree, or an English degree or a writing degree, or an 'in' with some famous poet, or a collection of antique pens, or a library with leather-bound books...I had the sudden urge to answer all of them back with, "Sorry, family emergency.

Best Technical: Winner – NUTS (The Hall)/ Highly Commended – SUSUtv (DIY Dolly Cam)
General George S. Patton, Jr. was one of WWII’s greatest generals and one in whom the Germans took a great interest. Fighting Patton: George S. Patton, Jr. Through the Eyes of His Enemies by Harry Yeide ($30.00, Zenith Press) is a thick history and biography of a man who Hollywood immortalized in film. His real life equaled and surpassed that drama. At the age of five he told his parents he intended to be “a great general” and he did. He studied war like others study music or architecture. It was his passion. This book is the first to examine the legendary general through the eyes of his opposing generals, the Germans who devoted time and effort to know as much as possible about him and, during the conflict, where he was and where he was headed. They had good reason because he was instrumental in their defeat. This book is a wonderful piece of history on many levels by an author who understands the story of the mechanized cavalry—tanks—and the men who drove them into historic battles. Patton’s armored division was a key player in one of those battles that turned the tide for the allies in WWII was the Battle of the Bulge. Michael Collins and Martin King have written Voices of the Bulge ($28.00, Zenith Press) that is told through numerous first-person accounts of American officers and enlisted personnel who successfully repelled the German attack that was intended to shift the momentum of a fading war back in German hands. Almost a million men eventually took part in the conflict that generated unfathomable casualties. The book comes with a DVD that, together, is a fitting tribute to the men who made the ultimate sacrifice and the veterans who lived to tell their story.
It may be the curriculum. Look at the nearest public school for this one. All teachers must teach to the curriculum, no exceptions, alternatives, or workarounds. And in recent years the curriculum has been strongly driven by standardized tests and the need to score well on them. This is even more pathetic than the basic idea of curriculum design where a bunch of soi disant experts get together to arbitrarily decide on what goes into the curriculum and what doesn't. Man! I am so reminded of the Council of Nicea, huh? Orthodoxy, orthodoxy, is our cry. O-r-tho-dox-y. Are we in it? Well, I guess! Orthodoxy, orthodoxy, yes, yes, yes!

A life spent around madness is the subject of Riding Fury Home: A Memoir by Chana Wilson ($17.00, Seal Press, softcover). In 1958, when she was age of seven, her mother held a rifle to her head and pulled the trigger. The gun jammed and she was taken away for the first of many visits to a mental hospital. Other suicide attempts would follow and the author chronicles forty years of her relationship with her mother and the way it was affected by the changes in the social landscape of their time. She was the sole caretaker of her mother and it was not until she left for college in Iowa that she was able to break the dysfunctional bonds and find her own space which included her own lesbianism. The author has been a psychotherapist for twenty-five years and this book must surely have been cathartic.

Ok, I think my husband is on board with eating "paleo" for 30 days. 30 days of meat, vegetables, fruit, nuts, fats, and seasonings... no grains or legumes (how am I going to live without my peanut butter?!) And no dairy... but we are going to drink our milk :) I know, it is cheating.... I'm a cheater, I guess. But no cheese. Grassfed butter is permissable, though. We are not trying to cure any diseases here or add years to our life. Just add life to our years. I am not planning on this being a permanent thing... We will see how we feel after 30 days and go from there. Perhap we will tweak it to our liking after the first 30 days and end up healthier in the long run. That is my hope. It should at least give me some new challenges in the kitchen :) Actually, it might simplify things a ton!

Just so we're PERFECTLY clear - Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a wealthy box company owner. He also has an alternate personality (William Hurt) who tells him to kill people. After killing some people one night, Dane Cook catches him and begs to be taught how to kill. In the meantime, Mr. Brooks is being chased by multi-millionaire police detective Demi Moore, who is going through a really nasty divorce with that guy Samantha used to fuck on Sex in the City while possibly also being stalked by another serial killer who just escaped from prison. Oh, and there's also trouble at home, as Mr. Brooks' teenage daughter has just quit college and is hiding some shady secrets of her own (she's pregnant! and maybe some other stuff!).
What also doesn’t help is that even though we follow the ‘recommended’ schedule and get vaccinated for the same diseases; it isn’t the same vaccines. If you don’t already know, vaccines are not produced by doctors, the CDC or ‘health care professionals’; they are a product made by companies, several in fact. So I ask everyone who has had a vaccine:

Despite “the risks involved” they continued with the policy of free entry for immigrants. They kept no records of numbers entering, apparently because the immigrants were, as Commonwealth citizens, British subjects, nor did they give practical support, leaving it to local councils and voluntary organizations. Throughout the 50.s many delegations from local councils of areas effected went to 10, Downing Street, to ask for practical help and funds. On the 21st of November 1952 the Town Clerk of Brixton asked for regulation of immigration.

Throughout the decades of the nineteen-seventies, eighties and nineties the South African Reserve Bank followed a policy of high interest rates in order to limit consumer spending and inflation. During the nineties foreign exchange restrictions were lifted and the country was exposed to the process of economic globalisation. Under these circumstances interest rate has had to serve the additional role of attracting speculative money flows from overseas in order to maintain the balance of payments - and this while savings and long-term investments of local people and organisations was flooding out of the country! The decision to lift foreign exchange restrictions has had a disastrous effect on the impoverishment of the nation. High interest rates have had to serve as the all purpose 'hammer' for managing economic and monetary policy.
In the early ‘90s, Cruse signed on with an imprint of DC Comics to make a graphic novel addressing the Civil Rights movement in the South of the 1960s. To him, this book was a shot across the bow of the aggressively selfish Reagan-Bush era that was so dismissive of the more hopeful period a generation earlier. But the subject matter was raw and gritty, and Cruse felt it couldn’t be addressed in the open style of his earlier work. He decided that texture and skin color needed to be applied with a dense crosshatching technique, and advised today’s aspiring cartoonists at CCS to “surrender to what your story demands, even I that contradicts what your lazier side wants to do.” Although this meant that a book he figured would take two years to draw wound up taking four, the awards and acclaim won by Stuck Rubber Baby were worth the toil. His graphic novel was an achievement this cartoonist doesn’t intend to try to match, saying “at heart I’m a bigfoot cartoonist, and nothing could make me happier than drawing a person slipping on a banana peel.”

Business-to-business or B2B email marketing distinguishes itself from business-to-consumer or B2c email marketing using some main reasons. Your articles needs to be right to the idea, professional and persuasive enough since most recipients who appeal to B2B email marketing need to know your own purpose for engaging communication together, the value as well as the benefit you will get from their store. Just how can your business benefit their company? These are the basic forms of questions you should consider before beginning an email campaign. Answer these kind of questions within your email newsletter.

But even now we are experiencing the spiritual as well as the material nature. How is that? Because we ourselves are a combination of matter and spirit. We are spirit, and only as long as we are within the material body does it move. As soon as we are out of the body, it is as good as stone. So, since we can all personally perceive that there is spirit as well as matter, we should also know that there is a spiritual world as well.
Last night we’re on our homestretch when it started to rain lightly. I became a bit more cautious and tried to slow down. A speeding taxi suddenly cut me off and since it was a stupid and unnecessary stunt I gave him a piece of my mind by blowing my horns continously behind him for a couple of seconds. I wasn’t off steam yet when suddenly, there was this motorcycle who swerved into and out of the lane. After swerving in front of the jeepney on the rightmost lane, the motorcycle tires must have lost grip and it slid down. The rider seems okay but his motorcycle might have a long gash on the side to remind him to be more careful especially on wet conditions.

Last November, I was lucky enough to attend the 2011 Global Microfinance Summit in Valladolid, Spain, where I learned about Bankers without Borders® (BwB). I had no idea that such a program existed, and became excited with the idea that maybe my skills could be useful in fighting global poverty. When I returned back home to Portugal, the first thing I did was visit the BwB website to browse open volunteer opportunities. I applied for the Microsavings Communications Support project at Indian microfinance institution CASHPOR and, in time, was informed that I had been selected to participate on the project.

Compared to the book, my friend and I both agreed that they squished the first half of the book into a 20 minute segment, and then drew the rest out for another hour and 20 minutes! I realize that the first half is a little boring, and quite frankly romance free, but it seems unfair to the book.
That's what we should do south of Bronxville too. This section of the road is redundant with the Thruway/Major Deegan and the Hutchinson River Parkway, and it doesn't even carry trucks. It does not need to be six lanes wide. If we believe Governor Cuomo that the State needs to rein in spending, we should definitely not waste money replacing and widening this bridge. But we do not have to compromise on safety. We can convert the outer lanes of this road to shoulders. This will add protection and reduce speeding, preventing at least some future deaths.
Hudson's defence to the counterclaim arose primarily from Miss Jackson's approval of the designs. This defence was problematic due to the lack of formal written approvals as required by the licence, but the judge also looked further at the issue of whether Miss Jackson had the authority to modify the licence so as to allow Hudson to market on-field wear. Examining her authority, the judge took into account that she was not a director or even an employee of Umbro UK but rather of Umbro US. While she had been delegated the authority to approve designs as part of the day to day management of the agreement, she did not have the authority to change the terms of that agreement. Thus the purported variation to the licence agreement was of no effect.

After about 45 minutes of talking with S, the nurse came in to get her ready for a c-section. We left the room and met Jenni, our case worker from LDS Family Services. The hospital case worker told us we could go home and return in the morning to see the baby. WHAT? The baby was going to be born in about an hour--there was no way I was leaving the hospital!! So we hung out and waited. And in a little over an hour we met our little baby. It was so surreal!

In business, storytelling is all the rage. Without a compelling story, we are told, our product, idea, or personal brand, is dead on arrival. In his book, Tell to Win, Peter Guber joins writers like Annette Simmons and Stephen Denning in evangelizing for the power of story in human affairs generally, and business in particular. Guber argues that humans simply aren’t moved to action by “data dumps,” dense PowerPoint slides, or spreadsheets packed with figures. People are moved by emotion. The best way to emotionally connect other people to our agenda begins with “Once upon a time…”
However it seems that now the adapters aren't even trying for replication. I have to admit I found interesting Andrew Davies's highlighting of the suppressed homosexual theme in A Room With a View (last Sunday night's adaptation) - but surely that suppression is part of the essence of the novel, a novel about suppression with its own meta-suppression. And as for the reversal of the novel's ending with the WWI addition, well please tell me why this was necessary. And another thing: the way these contemporary interpreters of Victorian and Edwardian middle-class female protagonists leave their mouths hanging OPEN! Is no one in the media old enough, or well enough (or sensitively enough) read to know that even in the early sixties girls were constantly expected to hold their mouths closed as a sign of breeding and virtue? And especially when it comes to Miss Lucy Honeychurch! Oh, I know that Lucy's got a wild soul, but remember it's a wild soul in conflict with her breeding, and it's her PIANO PLAYING which betrays this, not hanging lips and glittering teeth on show. Did they feel they had to 'modernise' her to make modern audiences identify? Or do they just not care?

That’s what this is all about. A slow but steady erosion of the services the city provides to the population with an equal measure of tax cuts and elimination. Hell, while we’re at, why stop with the LTT? Instead of freezing property taxes, why not plug away at doing away with them altogether too?

The Uninvited - 3 stars. Not bad. A remake of the 2003 Korean chiller Janghwa, Hongryeon, starring a bunch of actors/actresses you don't know and will probably never see again. A few chills and a nice little twist at the end saves this from being a total waste of time. What to drink? At least one bottle of Stop Making Sense, an 11% eis bock, from Trinity Brewing Company (Colorado Springs, Colorado). This will do a few things: first, due to the high ABV it will actually help make sense of the movie, and two, due to the high ABV... you're just not gonna care if it's good or bad.

Now more desperate than ever to flee the country, the Geckos hijack an RV driven by a pastor and his two children. The pastor is suffering from a crisis of faith since his wife was brutally killed in a random car accident--an act of God, so to speak. The pastor is played to the hilt by Harvey Keitel and is one of my favorite characters in the film. His daughter, Kate, played by Juliette Lewis is near the top, too. A typically rebellious preacher’s kid, she is fascinated by the dangerous Seth.

The thing though, the nice thing, is how coming home to do this bookends and constrains the hours of my work life. It boxes the job in. “You, job! You start here and you end right there. You are not my everything. You never were. Sorry if that hurts you. Get over it.” And all by itself that constraint is pulling some mysterious levers in the back of my mind, adding minutely to a store of sweet calm that has been growing in the deep silence. I’m told that the middle-aged often experience some weird life-happiness that arises spontaneously out of nothing more than edits to the aging metabolism. That’s fine with me. There was enough misery in my 20′s and 30′s. I’m glad to replace that with a peace of mind, whether earned or merely excreted from genes that have suddenly switched on.

Fried plantains are pretty easy, though there are a few steps involved. The end result is totally worth the effort. I use sweet yellow and brown plantains for this, but I’m sure the starchier green ones would work just as well. Start by peeling the plantains, which (unlike bananas) you will probably need a knife to start. Then cut the plantains into sections about an inch thick. Heat some oil in a wide pan, and add the segments of plantains. Cook them over medium heat, and flip them over when the first side browns. When the second side is browned remove them from the pan onto a paper towel. Season them with a little bit of salt. Now the fun part: using the flat side of your knife, squash each segment so that they’re only half an inch thick. When you’ve flattened all of the plantains, heat the oil again and add the plantains back to the pan. Let them get a little crispy on each side, then remove from the pan and sprinkle with a little bit more salt.

One example we talked about in our discussion last night was putting the buggy in the buggy corral at the grocery store. So, if this is what I am teaching Meri Hobbs, I would tell her, "Meri Hobbs, we put the buggy into the corral for several reasons. If we don't, it could block someone else's parking space or hit a parked car. If people don't put their buggies back, there might not be enough available later for everyone to be able to get a buggy to shop with..." etc... The funny part is that this discussion was my red flag for my prohibitive conscience. I thought "Oh my word, I always put my buggy up because I'm nervous that the one time I didn't, someone from my church would see me and think bad of me." Pitiful, I know!!!

My own experience with loss and Tom White’s mention in passing that he still enjoyed attending poetry events, especially ones connected with Leslie, made me know that a memorial reading where a few friends got together to read from her work would make sense. Mourning goes on for a long time. In a way, such events make it worse or, at least, more intense, but mostly they make it better, allowing all the various feelings to occur and be shared by others. Another similar event had taken place recently in Bolinas when Leslie’s ashes were interred, attended by poets there. I didn’t know about the Bolinas event when I planned the memorial on August 26th but when I did hear that it had happened I was pleased to know about it and to have been able to bring about another of what I intuit will be many ongoing celebrations of Leslie’s life and work that will occur over the years.
I have one friend that has been a friend for many years. Lately, we have been drifting apart. All friendships go through waves. I know this, but I am thinking this is more than a wave. This is a tsunami. We seem to have nothing in common anymore. She has a new man (well, okay, not so new - they've been together for 2 years), but he does not like me at all. I represent a time in her life that he was not a part of and did not approve of. So, our friendship is dying.

Not many families’s cook a family meal and eat as a family anymore. Do you remember Sunday dinners at home with roast, potatoes, carrots, and a vegetable called rutabaga’s? I do! My mom made a Sunday dinner called boiled dinner with corned beef, cabbage, potatoes, carrots and parsnips. Believe me, our house didn’t smell good that Sunday but the rest of the year we had the best smell’n house in the neighborhood. My memories of life’s best celebrations revolve around food.

It seems weird to wish people Happy Veterans Day when in fact the day is a remembrance of so many men and women who died in the line of duty to their country. Veterans Day is meant to honor and thank all who served in the United States Armed Forces.
Sometimes it's hard to find the words. Over the last few days, I've found myself using the phrase 'beyond words' many times. But the thing is, we're writers. We have to find the words. This is my attempt to find the right words to pay tribute to a very special person.
As a strictly monotheistic religion, Muslims believe in just one, absolutely perfect Creator – Who has no partner, no father, and no children. Absolutely no one and nothing else that shares in the power of the Creator. Muslims believe that everything in existence – including humans, the Earth, and animals – was created, and is being sustained, by a single, universal, all-knowing, supreme Creator – Allah. Allah is the same Creator that Jews and Christians believe in – and even Arab Christians use the word ‘Allah’. Allah is the same Creator that all the Prophets – such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhummad (may God’s peace be upon them all*) – called people to.
Anyway, I wanted to do an interview survivor/Hunger Games style. Ok, maybe not as gruesome and closer to how House interviews new candidates in Season 4. Gets 30 or so together, and eliminates someone at the end of the day. My boss quickly shot it down because the payroll would be astronomical. Because they would be working while fighting for the job. and it is just a part time job- not a career changer. But honestly, the interview process sucks. I hate it. It takes time away from my getting things done, and listening to people that just aren’t all that interesting. And some break off and beg for the job because they haven’t been working for so long and they are about to be kicked off unemployment or Welfare or whatever sob story they feel is necessary to tell me (because I’m going to hire you based on YOUR needs, not mine) I have been fortunate to have interviewed people with good stories and have personalities but it still is a tedious process and I hates it.

So this past weekend, I went out on Friday night, got absolutely shit-faced, cycled home in a blur, fell asleep, woke up at 3pm on Saturday, read for a few hours, then went out to an African themed party at the residence, with my new 'residence friends'. I got to try some African food, these spicy meatballs covered in what appeared to be some sort of mango chutney, along with these fried banana pieces in a sticky spice mixture. Absolutely delicious!

“The CDF’s criticism of receiving letters seems intended to silence discussion of important issues in the church. Why are Vatican leaders afraid to hear what women religious think on topics such as homosexuality that is being so widely discussed in all other quarters of society?

Her hand rests over my heart, forcing me to study the transparent fingers. I question everything; how can this possibly be? Yesterday she was here, solid and alive in a hospital bed. Today – she’s alive – solid and just about living in a hospital bed. But she’s changed. Last night, she died.

The titans deserve their own separate section for me to talk about. The titans in this are the most UNSETTLING things in a manga I have EVER SEEN (except for Uzumaki, which is in a category of its own). While the titans aren’t strictly deformed, they are somewhat disturbing; they may look distinctly human to some extent, but they are so…non-human at the same time, which is what I think unsettles me the most (also, the lack of genitalia…but that’s not something I ever wanted to see anyway). Also, when I saw the titan in chapter one put its head over the wall, I was like, “OH DAMN” in my head. The art there really had an impact, especially when you put the size of the thing in contrast to the humans around it.

After losing everyone she loves, concert pianist Liesl Bower has nowhere to go but to escape into her music. Searching for the peace she usually finds in her concertos and sonatas, Liesl can’t shake the feeling that she is being haunted by her past . . . and by someone following her. When she spots a familiar and eerie face in the audience of a concert she’s giving for the president in Washington, DC, the scariest day of her life comes back to her with a flash.
Despite all of this, we were still able to be taken aback by all the beauty around us. We have been there before a couple of times, but it never grows old, it never looks dull. It was cold and foggy and but I really don’t think that there are many places that still look so lovely on a grey day like this. Even the tip of the tower was hiding under a cloud of fog. It had something magical to it.

First off, this was Tyson’s first sprint race of the year – having run two 400’s earlier. Not too shabby for an opener. For comparison, Bolt opened at 200 this year in 19.56, and last year Tyson opened at 19.58. But a better comparison to Bolt lies in the 150 WR that Bolt set last year at the same meet. Looking at that race and comparing Tyson:

Well, I guess this is a ‘journey back to health’, I did no workout and ate not so great this past weekend! I don’t get it, you feel so great when you eat well and get a good sweat on but yet WHY is it so hard to stay motivated? For me, I need to see results, so when I workout hard for a week and see nothing, except that I feel amazing, I get super frustrated and eat crap! Once I get past a certain period (like a month) I KNOW it will be a habit and I will feel great and be so motivated that I wont know why I could live differently! So as I am writing this and trying to be “in the moment” I am trying to figure out how I can keep this going? Theres certain things that hold me back from the gym.. 1) knowing that people know what I looked like before (competing) and what I look like now 2) feeling the pain of my ankle, those are the only 2 things that keep me out of the gym! So, A) why do I care what people think all of a sudden? b) the trainer I have has made a program so my ankle doesn’t get irritated that much!! So WHY.. that is the question I’m trying to figure out? WHY?? I look at my pictures when I was competing and in that time of my life and I was so confident with myself, I didn’t care about what other people thought, I went into the gym and just killed it every time and knowing that I made it through some of the hardest workouts of my life really makes me think, WHY can I not get out of my rut? WHY do I keep going back to my rut when I KNOW how to feel better? I sometimes think that this is harder to get out of then training for competition! I guess I’m going to try to be ‘in the moment’ this week, I know sugar, caffeine, grains are bad for me, so instead of week by week, I’ll go day by day, try to remember how good I feel and hopefully each day will be a step forward into the right direction! Everyone talks about failure and how you need that to become who you are, to become stronger more resilient and it doesn’t matter how many times you fall, it’s about getting back up that matters! So I guess here’s my ‘getting back up after falling again”!

The substitution in the subject’s mind of the rubber hand for the real hand occurs because the brain creates an internal imaginary construct of what the body is and where its boundaries lie. To keep us from hurting our­selves, the brain needs to know where the body is at all times, and to do this, it relies especially on the senses of touch and vision. You need to know how far to extend your arm or withdraw it in any task or emergency, but this construct, created by the brain, can be fooled by a rubber hand. Our definition of the self can get recreated rapidly by the brain, so that even the brain doesn’t know who we are all the time. How can we define ourselves by our physical bodies when this definition is flexible even to our own brains?

Sometimes these disagreements are an opportunity to improve things in unexpected ways. Going back to Shadows on the Moon, after the initial edit letter, it was clear from my editor's comments that she and I perceived a particular character in very different ways. She pushed me to make changes to his behaviour to make him more vivid and understandable to the reader. But I felt that this would change him so profoundly that he wouldn't be the same character and the story wouldn't work anymore. We debated it over the course of several emails and through a couple of edits. Being forced to defend who this character was against my editor's extremely perceptive and insightful comments made him come into such clear focus for me that although I didn't make the changes my editor wanted, I did make several other changes - and my editor loved them.
And yet, while they share certain distinctions (like the fact that I met both around the same time – Jake in the spring of 2004, Cosby in the summer), they are two completely different men. And represent completely different parts of my personality. The best way to describe their differences is through the comparison of Ne-yo and Trey Songz (artists who share the rare distinction of me owning every official CD they’ve produced, either through itunes or actual CD – so clearly I like them lol). It seems funny at first, but really, both guys are like these men – at least in my life. Jake is Ne-yo, the good guy, clean cut, but can switch it up when he wants to. He’s the romantic who still likes to play around. Cosby is Trey, a little more rugged, but still looks damn good in a suit; he’s the guy who seems like he’s just about sex when you first see him – but there’s something else in there that draws you to him.

I recently read Search to Belong by Joseph Myers. Myers makes some strong points but ultimately he falls short on the purpose of the church. Myers seems to think that because people have limitation, the church should not encourage deeper relationships. I guess he presumes that most people are already at or near capacity. I don't think that is true. In fact, I think most people are looking for more personal and more intimate relationship, but struggling to find them. That is they struggle to find the godly form of those relationships and thus relationships often are a burden not a joy.
The Promise Walk for Preeclampsia means something unique to each participant across the country… but this year for one young preeclampsia survivor, it means getting to see her artwork impact thousands!
I’m tired today. My mind did an awful thing to me this morning. It made me think it was Saturday. So when my body naturally woke up at the god awful hour of 6, I tucked myself a little further into my bed and thought, “it’s going to be so nice to sleep in today.” -_- Wrong. My brain worked hard to correct itself and sent out several reminders as to why today could not be Saturday.
Happy baking!
From the Treasury Department’s perspective, the case is a victory, albeit an incremental one, in the battle against terrorism financing. Lebanon’s Central Bank showed that it was willing to shut down the Lebanese Canadian Bank and sell it to a “responsible owner,” said Daniel L. Glaser, assistant Treasury secretary for terrorism financing. An important avenue to Hezbollah has been blocked.

As the biomaterials field advances technically and demonstrates the value of its technologies to the broad biomedical community, interest in the field naturally expands. Joining the traditional chemistry and biomedical engineering audiences of past years, are molecular biologists, immunologists, pharmaceutical scientists, tissue engineers and regenerative medicine clinicians, with total registration approaching 300 people.

We intend to deal with the complaint as a formal investigation, which means it will be considered by the ASA Council. We will then draft a recommendation for the Council based on your response to us. Once the Council has made a decision, the adjudication will be published on our website.
If you played music in Austin at any time during the mid-Nineties, you probably sat at a club or bar next to my pal Jonathan Toubin at least once. If not, maybe he made flyers for you at the old 6th Street Kinko's. He's lived in New York for more than seven years now, but he still runs into more old friends than I do whenever he's in town.

I have been VERY busy with work the whole week last week that I did not even have half an hour to craft. At one point, I found my job torturing. I came to work an hour early everyday last week, went back from the office later than usual, perused documents at home, and I had few sleepless nights. The worries and uncertainties made me a sad lady but thank God, I just do what I should be doing and everything is almost final and fine today. Nonetheless, while haven't had time to craft I managed to click my favorite links when I was stuck with work and I love how those beautiful cards and layouts made me smile, and how just visiting and stay connecting with other crafters made my heart filled with joy :D
And, I figured, why not make the first post on my good mate, Richard Freeman of the Center for Fortean Zoology.
At thirteen years old, Vika began to worry about what would become of her when she reached sixteen. With no family and no chance for adoption, the fear for her future would consume her every thought. But during Christmas, before her fourteenth birthday, Vika came to America to be hosted by the Carlisle family. She had no way to know it but she, along with another girl from an orphanage in another city, were on their way to stay for a few weeks in San Antonio, TX. Here, in their home, for the first time in many years, she was able to experience a sense of family. She went to bed each night not starved for a kind, encouraging word, or a hug and kiss goodnight; but, instead she was filled with love and support, hugs and kisses, and gifts, during that holiday season.
Yet what if the deal cannot be brokered? Or should Arsenal take the money and run in any case? van Persie is 29 years old, an offer of £30m or more for a player of his age should surely be given hard consideration. If it goes to £40m, does it become a ‘no-brainer’? This idea might be enough to make some hyperventilate but it is not so far-fetched. The club is bigger than any player and in theory, a large transfer warchest would allow significant reinvestment, a restructuring of the wage structure toward meritocracy rather its’ current egalitarian phasing.
Pink: As a delicate color, increased exposure to pink can cause a sense of physical and emotional weakness. Most people associate this hue with femininity and love. People who favor pink are often seen as tender, caring, playful, charming, romantic, and loving in nature.
This weekend was jam packed with activities. On Friday night I ran home after work to spend some time with Daisy, Catherine's dog, who periodically spends some time at my house. We usually have a good time but it does tend to break her heart that my cats emphatically refuse to play with her. After I spent some time with Daisy I headed down to RJ's Bob-Be-Que Shack to join @sjwaters, @c_giffin and Mary Ann for some famous BBQ and music and to say hey to Twitter_Adverse_Dave. Seriously, they were just on KCPT's Check, Please! and I believe they are due to appear on Diners, Drive in's & Dives soon. They are now famous....and packed with people. Afterwards, we headed to the driveway to drink wine in front of the fire pit.
In glorious technicolor with sparkles everywhere they can be put, the chickens faint, flop and finally dazzle their way through this silly romp with a gentle reminder that performers need friends and fans too. Dan Santat's chickens and other barnyard animals are delightfully blocky and exuberant and the design of the book makes all the jokes moooove perfectly.

It’s been hot here in Phoenix; we had our first weekend of 100 degrees temperatures. The air is still, so the house doesn’t cool down at night despite the ceiling fans. It makes for poor sleeping. Someone is sleeping sound this Sunday morning, cold as a mackerel, on the couch. There is evidence he took one of the sleeping pills I brought home from the pharm rep. The Rx is designed to take in the middle of the night if you should wake up at 3AM and you can’t go back to sleep. I am curious to hear what he thinks of it – if he wakes up.

The COP has now sold out its entire birthright to the UNC…it could stop calling itself a party…there is nothing separate or distinct about either parties or their vision and mission. Coming highlights will be seeing both Carolyn and Prakash sing mightily for their suppers in Parliamentary debates.
heres the DNA report below NOTE- from Sherlock-When I ended our communication, Eliza told me this was not real, I have good reason to believe she may have changed the numbers to suit,as she did think she was chatting to the real Elvis Presley,As she stated above Jesse may have doubts. You have to question why would she would send all this information. I am sure that they will come up with some kind of defence,but in all my years of detective work,the evidence is clear,they know of no Jesse and indeed they have no real proof, if she so easliy believed all this,it proves that they haven fallen pray of a fake.And because they harbour some idea that Elvis is alive, they thought I was the real deal.
Whatever view one comes to regarding questions of authorship (and the authorship of Job, for example, is likely to remain unknown), the biblical text firmly identifies the reign of Solomon as the era of ‘Wisdom’ par excellence.
but in focusing on the pain, i neglect all of the beauty: the brightest and most entertaining and hard-working batch of students i ever could have asked for; the completion of a master’s thesis project that was innovative and honestly, a blast to do, and may also lead to conferences and presentations in the near future that would be of great professional importance; yoga students that have completely changed my life in so many ways – with their openness, their love of adventure, and their willingness to let me be a part of their various life journeys; family and friends that have rallied around me and lifted me up, again and a again, when i have threatened to crumble; and now, even as i’m laying here full of percocet and oxycontin with a completely numb right leg, i am so amazed and grateful for the beautiful souls in my life who are offering their time, food, cars, and company just to help me heal.
Curiosity caused me to click the link. I read stories all the time about people who convert from atheism to Christianity. So, naturally, I wondered how the story would go if suddenly thrown into reverse. Remarkably, the stories were similar: A prolonged period of questioning followed by a hesitant acceptance of a new identity eventually leads to a public proclamation and a tearful, joyous embrace by a new community of supporters.
nothing made a sound.
Bonnie from Revolutionaries came up with this fantastic idea to turn a used shampoo bottle into a sponge holder. How fantastic is that? I've got this one at the top of my 'to do' list and I've got just the bottle in mind, large enough for a sponge and a brush. Thanks Bonnie! You're just too clever!
I was really excited and proud when I got off the phone. That I could speak my message of holistic health so clearly to my grandfather. It's funny, and eye-opening to me, because he might have been the last person I would have expected to listen.
Even water puddles will give rodents all the water they need to drink. So all leaks must be fixed, and all ruts and depressional areas must be drained or filled in. Keep all guttering clean so water doesn’t stand. Make sure your window air conditioner isn’t creating a puddle. Cover swimming pools and hot tubs. Drain birdbaths and ornamental ponds. Water hoses are notorious for leaking at the connections; so when you’re finished using the hose shut the water off at the spigot, rather than at the hose nozzle. Cease lawn sprinkling for the duration of the infestation.
That’s what happens when you walk closely with Jesus for a while, I suppose. Gray isn’t gray so much anymore. My senses are awakened and I see and hear and know what I never could have before. This perceiving and knowing crescendos from the inside out, and by it, I both experience and see the most excruciating pain and delightful joy.
Meanwhile, when joining the Heat, James asked Riley that he wanted to become more of a distributor rather than carrying the burden of scoring task. The failed Jordan want-to-be was dreaming to become a new Johnson – whom is known as one of the best point guard in the franchise history. And later Riley asked Spoelstra to transform the 6-foot-8-tall naturally aggressive scoring small forward to play the delivering point guard role.
Everything came together perfectly. The eggs finished cooking at the same time the toaster oven went off and I was able to dish everything without a problem.
A short story based upon the same character got some one-star reviews by people who didn’t know what Dadaist elements were, and had no idea that a short story couldn’t possibly deal with a subject in as great a detail as a full novel. I guess I accepted the implied challenge, and I knew I couldn’t just walk away.

This traybake easily won the Facebook Poll but, to be perfectly honest, I wasn't sure if it would be something I'd enjoy. I'm not overly keen on treacle, and the title suggests that it features heavily in this recipe.
ABROAD is a 76,000-word new adult novel.
Our new location is just over 1500 square feet and it will allow us to have a bit of a meeting/craft/networking/workshop/unpacking/whatever we want space. Having this extra space is something that I have dreamt about since our first "Decorating Dilemma Workshop".
I stopped watching TV, do not even have it hooked up, sits in a corner in my Office. I watch on Laptop or on small porty DVD player that can also play into a Low cost LCD monitor, low power, great picture, small footprint as well.
Mickey flat out LOVED seeing his likeness in the middle of the tee and made a big fat honkin’ deal over it to the kids, drawing the famous shape of his head in mid air and fake laughing. And poking fun at the other characters who had already signed it. Behind their backs. Donald was jealous of Mickey's head being the centerpiece and took the saying, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all' to a whole new level. Minnie made sure to sign beside Mickey and to let us know how dreamy she thought he was. With her body language.
Novel, but only because I’ve never really read any short stories. *gasp*

We did not make the colossal sacrifices between 1939-1945 in order to submit meekly, a bare few decades later, to yet another undemocratic ideology redolent of Nazism. We are not going to let this happen, we’re simply not. We are the awakening majority and for the sake of not just ourselves, but our children and grandchildren, we cannot allow Islam to take any further control of Great Britain.
2. One of the nice things about ads on Goodreads is that you can target not just genre readers, but people who read e-books as well.
So I got to spend the day in my bedroom with my blackout shades pulled. It’s a beautiful day in Alaska, and my eyes can’t handle light. Sigh. But my eye feels much better right now, and I can even see better than I could to start the day. It might have been relaxing except that my alarm has been constantly going off reminding me to put in my constant drops. And tonight I will even have to set my alarm for every couple of hours. But it’s my sight we are talking about so I will totally obey the doctor’s orders to the letter. I’m ever grateful for my children, who have allowed me to take it easy and didn’t complain when I decided that sight was required for cooking and that tonight we would eat cereal for supper.
I've been presented at by several agencies who want to kill advertising, usually with some cross-eyed planner committing the murder. 'It's dead,' they say. 'It's changed. If you just do advertising, you may as well take your brand and throw it into a well full of shit and snakes and napalm.'
4) Heart Murmur - This is a direct result of the two things mentioned above. It was agreed that these were not significant enough for surgery right now but that they would follow Owen with regular echos to make sure his heart is functioning A.O.K until such time as he needs treatment.
But a word on social media: while hesitant at first, the authors I’ve worked with who are naturally industrious, fierce and curious, have found a second calling in it. Connecting on social platforms is just another opportunity for fan engagement. Who doesn’t want to meet their fans, and hear from readers valuable feedback? You'll not only develop meaningful “virtual” relationships, which sell your books. You’ll also be far more informed in writing your next book, being knowledgeable about what themes in your writing have most resonated. Once authors get the knack for using social media, or crafting opinion pieces they’d never imagined they could write, and often for online sites they never thought could be as important attention-wise as they actually turn out to be, authors see immediate gratification. Rather than waiting interminably on a chance TV spot, my authors feel more gratified in seeing a Google Alert pop up for them every day, or a splurge of talk on Twitter around one of their recent posts, and perhaps there’s even a new and active follower on their blog who’s rallying friends to post and read – a fangelist as I call it. My authors feel visible, and that the book they spent two years writing – well someone on Goodreads, and another on Amazon, and several more on Huffington Post, and now the LA Times is calling you for an interview… All these people think it matters. And my authors and I can watch the momentum in real-time.
Many of these came in quick succession, very few came as a single shot (just the $5000 in fact---that wiped my luck out for a good 2 years).

When people lay aside the Lord God and his way of thinking and living it is a mere matter of time before changing attitudes begin to occur. Have any of you prayed in accordance with 1 Corinthians 16:22?
8. For goodness sake, you are beautiful. Love yourself and love your body. What’s more, look after it. Exercise even if you suck and eat a healthy diet. You’ll set up good habits for the future, you’ll have more energy and concentrate better. Remember, if you’re studying in an Australian program, sport is a big part of school, and once you finish school, you will probably do a lot less exercise. Try keep up your fitness level once you leave school.
Then Spirit comes along and sends me a message, like this one...and I can keep on going to fight yet another day.
FAMU goes down early to FVSU (no homo) and after a virtual minstrel show of cacophonic buffoonery on the field by FAMU, the Rattlers manage to start pulling away at the half. FVSU 12, FAMU 21.

I took this photo in the small village of Andahuaylillas in Peru. The village was a real treat. Birds were singing, the farmers were sitting on benches resting after a hard days work. It was like the time had stopped.

Like all homunculi, they were grown in sealed jars (homunculi die if exposed for any considerable period to the air), filled with water and eventually buried under heaps of manure. These were treated (as usual) with some special, but unspecified, solution, and doubled the size of eight of the homunculi, producing a series of 1-ft-tall specimens.

On the bright side we also decided that after the punishment was dished out we would not dwell on it, so she got on with decorating the house as originally planned. Anyway I think her young cousins probably enjoyed all the pink sparkly Barbie decorations more that her friends would have.
Nearly every Sunday morning, my hubby and I wake up at the crack of dawn to head out to our local flea market. While he takes photos of all the crazy stuff, I'm always on the hunt for that perfect vintage item whether it be vintage sewing supplies, bakelite bangles, aqua kitchen accessories, or 50's hats.

De-centralization of the reading culture will cause people to lose jobs, companies to go splat and dirty laundry to wind up in the street. That's the nature of the beast, and at no time in history has being a reader been so fundamentally awesome as it is today.

And there were plenty of laws at the time restricting automobile use in ways to ensure that those whom still depended on the horse were not adversely impacted. Speed limits in cities, for one example, which were enacted not to spare the feelings of the horse, but to ensure safe travel in an environment where automobiles and horses were in close contact.
On Monday 9th August, 2010, I accidentally stumbled across this film on television and decided to give it a watch. As I joined the film part-way through, I decided to post a running commentary / ‘live review’ with various thoughts…
If you missed my daily April posts, they were about music. Not just any music posts however, I tried to write about stuff that not many people know about.
10. My Best To You 3:42
I was really interested in the architecture of the tower. The dark lines of the stones that make up the tower had to be highlighted. I choose a odd angle to show off these details and it shows a bit on how they were constructed. If you look closely in the middle there are some dark rectangles. I am not sure what those are from, maybe its repairs or some weathering?
After much dithering, I settled on a synonym (I won’t repeat it here) that was commonly used in the Victorian period to describe the male sex organ, and is still widely used today. Then and now, it’s not fit for polite company, but the alternatives made me dissolve into giggles every time I typed them out.
A quick check on Facebook, no mention, a scroll through their BBC Scotland website, nada, a long and involved wander through the Loch of Indifference that is their @BBCScotlandNews twitter feed, nope, not to be seen among the detritus of stories about missing kittens, porridge, tartan, the CBI prophets of Doom or the latest Death by Garlic Bread headline. I checked, I scrolled back through 108 tweets of varying fluffiness until arriving at their last tweet on the 4th of September and their first on the 5th of September, which matched exactly the timescale of The Herald, whom in the shape of the estimable journo with cowboy boots and a neat wee beard Robbie Dinwoodie unveiled the results of the Poll here.
January 9, 2009 Clip No. 1979
It’s not that the charged-shot isn’t a good base premise for a game mechanic. That’s not really an accurate statement. It COULD be really good, provided the game was developed around it. Perhaps special enemies would require combo shots, where a charged shot would open up a vulnerability that would require you to use a different weapon or salvo of normal shots to finish. Mega Man gets a big bump up in this installment, but the world of Dr. Wily and friends does not.
27. Hummingbirds are the only creatures that can fly backwards.
Now there aren’t many times I’m genuinely SHOCKED while reading a screenplay. But this shocked me. And the funny thing is, we were just talking about this the other day (or at least I was talking about it. I don’t know if you guys were). They just killed off the main fucking character!!! I was SO shocked, in fact, I actually went back and re-read the scene. Did they just really do that? Did they kill off the protagonist?? This had to be how audiences felt when they first saw Psycho (I never experienced that feeling as the first time I saw Psycho, I’d already been told what would happen).
Another factor to consider is the markets of the respective phones. How many games came out this week on the app store and on the Android Marketplace? I don’t have exact numbers, but with Apple surpassing half a million apps and Android not too far behind, it’s safe to say that getting your game noticed is a lot harder on these devices.
I went to Archiver's today, to see the Holiday Card Show Case. They had alot of cute ideals, for card making for the Christmas Season. I met two of my friends there Tammy and Mary. We enjoyed the free class and then made two free Christmas Cards also. During the class we made a gift tag and colored a image with Copic Markers and did some dry and wet embossing. With the cards I made last night, I used the same paper pack by We R Memory Keepers and Colored with Copic Markers the images. The digital stamps used was Torico's, Little Muslings, Digital Doodling, and Shelley's Rusty Pickle. I used Martha Stewarts border and snowflake punch. I used Ek Success border punch, gems, ribbon and chip board letters from paper pack, faux eyelets, pearls, flowers and brads. Have a wonderful and blessed weekend and week! Thank you for stopping by my blog!
Abigail and Dolley readers I read recently that many scientist believe that our most painful memories are stored in one spot in the brain. It's a dark corner, with a closed door, bolted shut and rarely, if ever, accessed. That is until something happens that needs to go into that spot. For me, the death of my Dad has slung the door wide open. Anguish long forgiven and forgotten is as real to me as it was when I was 12 years old. Perhaps only children of divorce can understand how painful those memories can be, but this is not a blog about pain. Nor is it one about divorce or grieving, this is a story about friendship. I'd like to share with you an extraordinary tale of God's wisdom, mercy, and care and how He looked down on two of His daughters and blessed them with each other.

Before, parents around the land had not known that the disappearance of their children and the mournful, spine chilling scream that arose from the forest each time they did, were due to the monster. This was until seventeen children had gone missing, and after each and every one had been devoured the parents could hear the same soul-wrenching howl that meant the monster had indeed struck again. One of these had been Alice’s own brother, and since then children had been banned from entering the Forest of Lyca, children just like Alice.

Boil mixture rapidly until jam is set, mixing often. I used my candy thermometer to keep track of the temperature and once it reached 220F, I started testing it using the cold plate method. I had a plate in the freezer and put a little of the jam on it. When the jam jelled up after being put on the plate, it was ready. This took about 10 minutes for me.
We are part of a new village now. Our neighbours were neighbours before, were not for a while and now are neighbours again. The village we made part of in Somerset has dispersed. Our friends Hannah and Daniel and the twins were parked by us there again. They have headed off east to join another gathering. We'll see them again somewhere sooner or later. We'll see others too, familiar and unfamiliar. It's a strange experience of life, crossing paths with others, a unique experience for each person, and yet shared in some aspects. It is the net that links us all, the strands are gossamer-thin and steel-strong, and each path-crossing vibrates them.
The back of my T-shirt did have a TOP 50 print (I’d found out later that I was ranked 16th in my category). It was a surreal moment. I was astonished. And doubtful at the same time. But I was mostly happy. Nevermind that I’d missed a new personal record by 5 minutes or that the speakers had to blare a Miami Sound Machine song that moment or that the wounded ITB needed some stretching that very instance. This was perhaps a once in a lifetime experience and I wanted to savour every second of it. I heaved and then, started to laugh out loud.

Amanda Hocking says on her blog that in February 2010, after countless rejections, ‘I said to my room-mate, “I don't think it's going to happen. I don't think I'm ever going to get published. I don't know what more I can do. I've worked like a factory putting out the best books I possibly can. I've studied trends, the industry, business models.”
So, those are my broad thoughts on how social media can and should be used as a customer service tool. What are your thoughts? Is it a good way to connect with customers who have problems or is the good ‘ol call centre still going to be the way to go?

Now, here is where a lot of my so-called Christian brethren, drop the ball. The only way for this freedom to work is for it to work for ALL. Just as it is wrong for Osama to tell me that I must be a Muslim, or that I must agree with his beliefs, it is also wrong for me to say someone must be a Christian or that they must agree with MY beliefs.

I am so sad that I do not get to hold this sweet babe in a few months. I am hopeful for heaven. One day, I will get to meet my child, we will have a perfect reunion and I will know all about him/her. I am excited to have all the members of our family together. I am thankful that I have the hope of Heaven, and death on Earth isn't the end of the story. I'm thankful that Jesus loved me enough to take on what I deserved, so that I don't have to.
A new layer has just been inserted inside the movie clip.
One is found in - Ephesians 5:4 and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. We have all been around those who every time they open their mouth have some sort of inappropriate comment that comes out which they intend to be funny. We all know people who have what I like to call – a potty mouth. Paul here in Ephesians 5:4 is addressing these people. He is saying indecent talk, filthy stories, obscene talk, vulgarity, evil minded talking, and things like this should not be part of the Christian life but it should be words of thanks that are coming across out lips. It is replace your potty mouth with a thankful mouth. Paul is making a moral appeal to the people of Ephesus and notice the theme of the moral appeal. It isn’t "avoid these things so that you can be a saint." Rather, it is "you are a saint; now live in a manner fitting for a saint."
Description:
Before his capture, Goering wrote a letter to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, offering to work with Eisenhower on the conditions of the German army’s surrender, according to an account of Goering’s capture by Brigadier Gen. Robert Stack kept by the 36th Infantry Division Association.

At each stage, Huhne and his co-authors write, the opponents of the euro have forecast disasters which have in fact never happened and which always looked most unlikely … the Euro-sceptics constantly underestimated the competence of the Europeans and their ability to organise things properly.

We can’t talk about this album, without talking about one of the most amazing vocal tracks on of the planet, The Great Gig In The Sky. This is the part where the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end, my whole body shivers and I get goose pimples in my arms and chest. When those first notes start, I start to hum the tune like a natural reaction, I have no control over my vocal chords at this point. My heart starts to beat in the exact rhythm of the piano, my temples twitch, and my fingers tap whatever surface they happen to be on, and all this happens like I’m watching myself being taken over by spirits or something, it’s all involuntary. And then she starts to sing. Suddenly I’m floating away, I’m in a dreamworld of swirls and colours and the music has taken over me in every way possible.

However, there are a lot of leaders in politics. If my civics class taught me correctly, we have 435 U.S. representatives and 100 U.S. senators. Each state has additional state leaders, and cities have their representatives. In the United States, we are fortunate enough to elect those who represent our goals, objectives and ideas at numerous levels of government.

Silence descended upon them once again, broken only by the sounds of both horses feet upon the dirt path. Brulee’s grip upon the reigns remained tight and she seemed to be holding herself more stiff than before, trying to avoid contact with her. It was many minutes before Creme could muster enough courage to speak again.
Susan watched as they rubbed noses, she saw how Carol giggled and squirmed, how she begged for more as Viv put her back onto the armchair and turned her attention to Rachel, who was sitting across the room, watching silently, chewing on the skin at the side of her thumb.

Handel and Oxendine have essentially the same platform and beliefs. I actually like Oxendine's platform slightly better because of his desire to eliminate the income tax in Georgia and his commitment to the Fair Tax.

This observation actually lines up with our own. We who are among the wealthiest and most powerful in the world are the most ungrateful and demanding. Anyone who has been anywhere there is abject poverty experiences unvarnished gratitude for the littlest things. In a moment I will never forget, I saw a Peruvian eight year old child take a single cookie given to him by the bishop and break it up into pieces to share with four other children and me, before he ate anything. You and I both know that the average American child of the same age would swallow the cookie whole and then ask where the other ones were.
Forgotten is one of those wonderful novels that holds you spell-bound from beginning to end. Catherine McKenzie writes of a strong protagonist whose life is turned upside down when she becomes victim to circumstances beyond her control. She has been missing for six months, even considered dead! But she can explain. However, Emma finds she cannot pick up where she left everything. Her job, her apartment...everything has changed.
In California, chicken-shit Governor Brown wanted to extend the sales tax and the car registration fees that were increased a few years ago. And who does that hurt the most? The lower-middle class, the working poor, the unemployed, and families living below or at the poverty level. And who does it not affect? The wealthy. At least Brown wanted to take the proposal to the voters, but the Republicans shut that down – fast. Brown didn’t even bring up the idea of raising taxes on those who could most afford it. We now have a budget that cuts social services and funding for education. Because lord knows, you can’t close the loopholes on corporate taxes here in California and you can’t raise taxes on the privileged few who control the vast majority of wealth and whose lives just keep on getting better and better while the lives of the majority of us keep on getting worse and worse.

One highlight for Grameen Foundation was the announcement of our collaboration with MTN Uganda and CGAP to research and develop mobile financial products for the poor. The need is clear: 2.7 billion people – most of whom live in developing countries – still do not have a bank account. This is largely because many low-income communities are underserved by financial institutions, which typically offer products that are more suitable for higher-income clientele.
Where cake is concerned, I've many a time had to rein in my natural unchecked impulses to make it all pink-iced, frou-frou and over-the-top. Embellished and curlicued to the nth degree, Marie Antoinette-meets-Mardi Gras, all fairy dust and unicorn sprinkles. Hey, I'm a girly girl.
Rémy: A friend of mine recently say to me that I was speaking about that at the age of 12 when I was watching X-files and playing heroquest. After 2 year of wasting my time with biology study I decided to become professional, so I followed the artistic path, mainly to conform to my parents wishes about study :). I don't have any ambitious professional project now. I'm enjoying my job and I will pursue it until I will be bored by minis. I will probably make some toys or big scale sculpture, more artistic stuff, anything that will be fresh at that time.

On my wednesdays I have a three hour lull between class and the MX job. I usually just draw, read, creep on people, have lunch with Jo or go for walk. This Wednesday's walk led me through China town or really just a pedestrian road of 90% Asian restaurants, 10% cheap, crappy cloths and souvenirs that you go through to get to paddy's markets from Darling harbor or vice versa (yes, that's a little tourist tip for ya). Annnyway, I did happen upon this cute (and dirt cheap) bakery with their Angry Birds themed goods. Slingshot not included.
If humans can’t predict the weather right, an animal waking up from hibernation definitely can’t.
God sent the prophets for a number of purposes. First of all, the fulfillment of predictions shows that God is in control. Some of the prophets prophesied about events that would take place hundreds of years later (Isaiah prophecies about the fall of Jerusalem in the 700s BC, and this didn’t happen until 586BC). The prophets give God’s perspective on the past, present and future, brought warnings of judgement that were meant to bring sinners to repentance and brought hope of restoration. We can think of the prophets as God’s “policemen.” The people of God had broken the covenant they had made with Him, and the prophets were calling them to repentance, before it was too late and they were judged. Many of the prophets prophesied about exile; Israel was exiled by Assyria in 722BC, and Judah was exiled by Babylon in 586BC.

I was lucky. My imagination wasn’t dulled by such things. Perhaps a large group of children do still flourish in the same way. But from what I’ve seen at schools I’ve visited, we’re doing a big disservice to so many.
We’ll need, then, a PR miracle that will absolutely reverse the public’s feelings about the squad – and there is hope. A good result in these World Cup finals or (do we dare dream?) a win, would surely right the recent wrongs and leave the nation pleasantly abashed for not having more faith in its national team.

If you hit a plateau, don't worry. It happens to everyone and is a normal part of any activity from athletic performance to weight loss to musical skill. Keep with it. Challenge yourself.

Challenge yourself, because as laudable as a 7 minute mile is, a 6 minute mile and a minute to prep your shooting position is better.

Ran-Hanuel started the engine and drove the car out of the spot before someone foolishly tried to hop on or block their way. “Hyun-Gi is going to kill both of us once those pictures hit the Internet,” he told her angrily. “And just when I thought I had everything straightened out.”

For an editor, empathy is as important as knowing grammar, spelling, and usage. Without it, editing becomes mechanical and the writing may become lifeless. Good editors work to feel and perceive exactly as their writers do. However, even this is not enough. If editors feel exactly with the writer, how do they help to rework the underpinnings of the writing? Complete identification all the time would give them no critical distance.
Kelly and Max get into a cutesy pillow fight with Zarin pillows. While Kelly's thinking, "omg! how awesomely cute will this look on camera?!"

Add to that the quarrels, the betrayals, the battles, the sorrow, and, above all, the mystery of those two little Princes - the heirs to the house of York - and you have a tale fit to entrance anybody. And other authors have certainly managed to make this story of the War of the Roses absolutely gripping.
The committee is likely to recommend that patches of forest be measured for their forest cover as well as biodiversity values. The panel has not considered the implications of the Forest Rights Act as yet. Under the existing rules, the ministry cannot allocate forest lands to development projects until the rights of the people under the FRA have been settled and the village councils of the affected area agreed to the diversion of forest.
Even when he was near death, he continued to carve the stone. His first work – dating back to when he was only sixteen – is the “Madonna della Scala“, followed by “Hercules” in 1492, which the artist created in his father’s house. The work was sent to France in the eighteenth century and it was lost.
When scandalous satires start appearing in the newspaper with details suspiciously similar to the goings on of Wentworth Hall, the Darlingtons are determined to keep their secrets to themselves and their affairs (both private and public) in order. And the first order of business is finding the culprit. But where to start? Downstairs among the staff? Or should the Darlingtons look even closer to home . . .

It would appear that Cllr Davey lives comfortably with his mum and dad, and is lucky not to have had to face the challenges that the less comfortably off residents of Broken Barnet have to face when they find themselves in need of social housing.

There are bands who arrive fully formed and there are those who take a little while to find their footing. Sometimes all it takes is one song. In the case of Baltimore’s Lower Dens, who are fronted by onetime folk eccentric Jana Hunter, that track was “Brains”. Released in advance of this record, the single added krautrock and electronic touches to the group’s signature guitar swirl and suggested a new dimension and a new confidence. Everything hit with more impact: the drumming was crisper, Hunter’s singing was richer and more evocative, and there was an extra layer of prettiness, but also menace. The message seemed to be, “Here’s a band you can’t ignore anymore.”
And then Peeta got this new Lego Harry Potter Wii game, which was clearly created by some singleton who hates children and their parents. It has no useful directions, so your child is left trying to wander around rooms and use magic with no understanding of what they are doing, until they break down in tears, which leads their mother, who has been reading walkthroughs from the Internet, to break down into tears and seriously contemplate burning the game and hunting down its creator to make them play the game in a locked room full of children for an unspecified number of hours.

Kohler Barnard said it was necessary for police station numbers to work given the "general unreliable nature" of the emergency 10111 number.
Pat: I’d been reading a lot of blogs where writers were giving it a try and having some success, especially Joe Konrath. I didn’t think I’d achieve his kind of numbers, but he made some good arguments for giving it a try. Especially for a book that had been published already — so it had reviews and had been professionally edited — but had fallen out of the print. The risk seemed very low. It would take some time to format it and come up with a new cover but, otherwise, the cost was minimal.
And that was OK. When we are visiting my parents, it is usually her grandmother who she finds comfort with if we are mad. If she wants to seek sympathy with the other adult in the house partial to her happiness, I’m fine with it.

On July 11, 2011, multiple strikes by U.S. drones on villages in northwest Pakistan killed at least 45 people. It was the second-largest death toll in a single day since the U.S. drone terror attacks began on Pakistan in 2004. According to Western capitalist media, the criminal attacks came just a day after the Obama Administration cancelled $800 million in military “aid” to Pakistan in order to put pressure on the Pakistani military to participate in U.S. terror.
