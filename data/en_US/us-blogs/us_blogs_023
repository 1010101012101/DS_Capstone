III. Mission Skills
In my previous Korea CP, I got one of Holika’s much raved about Egg Soaps, and since then, they’ve expanded the range of egg soaps to include green tea, red clay and charcoal. Naturally I felt compelled to get the set, as it came with the UV Magic Shielf Body Spray Sunscreen. I’ve been actively seeking to brighten and even out my skintone, hence I was also conned into getting the Snow White Intensive Serum by the very friendly SA.. lol..
wear it down and french braid my bangs.
Another feature of this invention includes a means to increase the overall weight of the swim paddle – presumably realized by the user when the arm is in the recovery phase of the freestyle stroke. This weight is an additional pad of material which may be added to the primary plate shown above. In one instance, this weight pad may include wool felt material which absorbs water to add weight.
Forgetting to take Tylenol before I went to school kind of stunk, too. Especially when I discovered I didn’t have a travel-sized bottle of meds in my bag after all.
They're everywhere, I thought, as I brought down two more zombies in quick sucession with my Winchester.

So be earnest, and repent.
Simply put, this is delicious. This is easy to make. This tastes very good! Oh, and I've made this recipe with sweet potatoes, and that's really good! I've used some variations-- savory rosemary and garlic... and I've even used orange juice.
"Malema's behaviour is irreconcilable with the constitution that the president has sworn an oath to uphold," said Mr de Klerk. He warned South Africans that the consequences would be "dire" if they ignored such pronouncements. Mr Malema's comments about whites stealing land has provoked fear among farmers of Zimbabwean-style land invasions. Mr Zuma did not contradict Mr Malema, although other officials said the remarks did not represent government policy.
Employers are required to provide “reasonable accommodation” for people with disabilities, such as extended unpaid leave for necessary treatment. The Chamber said it was concerned that the guidelines, which weren’t released, would make it harder for employers to deal with requests for leave.
Yes really! I warmed to the bonkers one over the year and in particular found the coverage of her Glastonbury performance extremely entertaining. The biggest shock was discovering that this gal can actually sing too! 'The Fame' is a cracking little album with more of a nod to electro-glam and Bowie than you might initially expect. This little gem is tucked away right at the end of the album (if you're lucky... it doesn't even appear on some re-issues) but beats everything else on there for my money.
Russian life expectancy continues to be horrendously low, for a nation that claims to be developed. Few Russian men live long enough to enjoy more than a year or two of vodka-sotted retirement. Heart disease, accidents, and violent crime take care of those that alcoholism, suicide, HIV, and drug resistant TB do not handle.
Finding one’s passion can be the difference between a life driven by happiness and one crippled by disinterest. It can be the difference between a life fully lived and one only a fraction so. It can also be the difference between the students who feel school matters, and those who feel it doesn’t. Make room for students to explore their passion at school. And see how it changes everything.

Tungsten is used to make your cell phone or Blackberry vibrate. Tungsten is a growing source of income for armed groups in Congo, with armed groups currently earning approximately $7 million annually.
I start every day outside with a list, either in my head or on paper, of what I'd like to get done. As nearly every job takes twice as long as I expect or I get sidetracked along the way, getting to the bottom of a list isn't something I expect to happen.
- ‘Sure. And I’ve just given a talk pretending I believed in privatisation, can you imagine? Hard to keep a straight face, but I think I managed it.’
At the same time, the government is taking all possible steps to expand trade and bilateral ties between Pakistan and India, he said.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "As part of the military contribution to the police led security effort to ensure a safe and secure games, a broad range of assets and equipment is being used by our armed forces".
Zitouna University must be restored to its former status as an Islamic university, not merely a college. It has become the Islamic Zitouna College. It was the first university – even before Al-Azhar. Zitouna University has turned into a place where girls who study Islamic law come without a hijab, wearing short sleeves and mini- and micro-skirts. It has a mixed swimming pool for boys and girls. Zitouna University must be restored to… The hijab must return. At the very least, it should be permissible.
Gosh, I've never thought about it! I suppose if there was a conflict of interest I would decline to edit someone's work. Time constraints might also be a problem in the future. But for the moment, no, and I am glad because all my clients have been lovely.
This is a concise and clearly written take on the idea that’s well worth reading.

The Daily Mail has found a new figure of fun in the form of a journalist called Samantha Brick. She writes deliberately provocative articles using headlines like “why do women hate me for being beautiful”, “I use my sex appeal to get ahead at work… and so should ANY woman with any sense” and today’s missive “sorry, some women ARE too ugly for TV”. I can’t bring myself to link them I’m afraid so I’ll link to her page on Journalisted instead.
Introverted Sensing often involves storing data and information, then comparing and contrasting the current situation with similar ones….the image can be so strong, our body responds as if reliving the experience. The process also involves reviewing the past to draw on the lessons of history, hindsight, and experience.

Oh and before I forget don't forget to pre-order your copy of The Pen & Paper Circle Kit. This edition has a really gorgeous A6 set of stamps and a cd containing 54 backing papers and coordinating png alphabets and if that wasn't enough there's a magazine with 12 step by step tutorials, hints, tips & inspiration. Remember, you only have until the 7th March to order.
I recently had the pleasure to work with a young model who is just starting out. She was excited to be shooting for a cosmetic company who are using the images as tagline ads. Nothing was too much bother, she waited patiently, enjoyed the make up artists attention, and happily wore whats she was asked to.

I think if this proposed change goes through, the general public will be even more reluctant to enroll their children in school in the first place.

Probably not the best way to start this, but I just saw The Thing. The 2011 one. And it…erm…wasn’t very good. Supposedly a prequel, it followed the story of the original to the letter, had renamed versions of the same characters in it, and had nearly shot-to-shot scenes from the original (want a tense scene where they check who and who isn’t the Thing? And then it goes wrong? You got it!). It was worse in every single way. It was tame, the characters were stupid, the special effects were generic, and it wasn’t scary.
Made Bacondogeronis or mac and cheese, because it's what they wanted and kids should get what they want as often as possible.

Not insane or bad or evil at all. It’s not a suit of ‘Human Skin/Flesh’ is it? (Even then the consensual could put forward a reasoned argument if the material came from a consenting and aware party . . . ). These are survival skills that should never be lost, but if everyone did this there would be no justification either for the suffering. Maybe animatronic foxes to practice with, THEN combined with SPONSORSHIP of free range foxes in specialised reserves as close to nature as possible, that are skinned ONLY AFTER natural death?
It didn't help, again, that this elaborate reality was couched in Murakami's serviceable prose. His writing smacked of self-validation and a nagging appeal to belief. Perhaps this latest installment could only be appreciated for its conception of an alternate underground reality whose plausibility could be accepted only in so far as this reality mimicked the main features of this reality: chaos, ambivalence, moral ambiguity. Perhaps we are living in it, always had been, in this "always only one reality" that Aomame was twice warned about. At least in Book 4, Murakami finally realized the novelistic vision he sketched in a 2001 NYT interview.

Great class, the bracelet above I think if my favorite piece from the class projects. The beads are not strung in. the metal is hammered all around them to hold them secure.
Sooooooo
The transaction is not done face to face...In fact, the seller will display his stock on a wooden stand, with asking price, and typically a bucket of some kind is left for the buyer to place the money in the bucket and take his purchase away, without any contact with the seller....It's based on trust...

Of the rest; the Paulaner brewery tap on Hochstraße is a very modern new build. Also a new build, but much pubbier and atmospheric is the Paulaner Bräuhaus at Kapuzinerplatz. This is where Eugen and Ludwig Thomas started brewing in 1889 and the shiny new glistening kettles produce Thomas Zwickl beers. The zwickl, by the way, is the tap that brewers draw the beer from to test it.
So, think of all those kids in your lives! Wouldn't they love to have a coloring book? Hand drawn, hand made, and packaged with care, here in Washington, you don't get this amount of care from the big box stores! And every dime goes into our adoption fund. What more worthy cause is there?

I have the desire to help people in need. I have a great love of the natural and the human body and it's function.
As a kid in the 70's and 80's, I was quite the entrepreneur. The wheels were always turning in regards to new business ventures. During my youth I operated a landscaping and yard care business, a bike repair business, sold art, did small engine repair, produced a neighborhood newsletter via my old manual typewriter, and performed auto body work, as well as auto maintenance. I can't even begin to describe the satisfaction and pride I achieved from being able to make money doing things I loved, while at the same time providing folks with affordable services that they need.

And it is for those very reasons (and the fact that it’s nearing the time for him to start living his life the way he wants to), I am supporting my son’s decision to go into the military. Trevor is the kind of kid that would be an asset, he’d lead by example, and frown upon abuse. He’d have a lot to add.

The funny thing is when I think a spanking is coming i really want to talk him out of it and dont want it. THen when i dont get this same spanking I just wanted to talk him out of its annoying.. WOW that sounds just as crazy written down lol.. I know its only been 7 months. but grrrr.. You know if he was very consistant and spanking me every time I turned around I'm sure I'd be complaining about that lol..
With a futuristic setting and a mysterious plot along with it, this book is a must wait. The Glimpse has brought attention to me when looking for a Dystopian novel to read. I cannot say how excited I am for this book, just reading the synopsis makes me really excited for it. Mental Sickness? Pures and Crazies? Mysterious disappearance? This book is one to look forward to! The Glimpse comes out June 7th 2012!
The theme for this month is Gourds. Gourds are very healthy veggies. The commonly used gourds I know are Bottle gourd (Lauki/Churakka), Ridge gourd(Tori/Peechinga), Bitter Gourd(Karela/Pavakka), Ivy gourd (Tindora/Kovakka), Snake gourd(Padwal/Padavalanga), Ash gourd(kumhada/kumbalanga), Chayote etc...If you know other gourds,let me know and I will add to the list.
In other health news, the pediatrician finally broke down and prescribed antibiotics to us for your ongoing ear infection, which she believes is caused by your ongoing teething. You hate the antibiotics and are quite certain that I'm attempting to murder you when I administer them, so I mixed them in with some sweet purees and gave them to you that way. You have a sneaky mom. I will always win! Remember that.
And thank you so much for your patience! I promise to launch soon!! Remember to keep track of us on facebook in the meantime!

This may seem silly, but I got this from my mom when I was first pregnant. I don't know if it was genetics, the fact that I was only pregnant for 34 weeks, or this cream, but I escaped pregnancy without any stretch marks. I loved this stuff. It helped moisturize and sooth my expanding belly and it smelled good, too!

This first lay out is about our chickens. They have been busy this spring laying eggs, so we have cooked up lots of dishes to use them up. Creme Brulee, Tapioca Pudding, Lemon Meringue Pie, Quiche, Devilled Eggs, scrambled eggs, and fried eggs. Some of the girls really get cackling when they lay an egg! All pattern papers are Basic Grey.
I want to thank each person that has already found some interest and/or entertainment in my writing. You have made this that much easier for me to take on this challenge. I don’t know where this blog will go from here. I have only been writing about the best vacation of my life and now that it is finished I will need to find a new direction but I see that as a welcome and exciting task.

One thing that he can do, which we have already suggested, is to greet parade-goers in front of Our Lady of Mount Carmel church on the day of the parade, and pass out water to them.
This updated edition also discusses the one arena in which our sexual freedoms have actually expanded since 2000: the civil rights of gay, lesbian, and transgender people. It’s an interesting, gratifying story, and it deserves to be told. We all deserve the comfort it provides, too.

Then recently I decided that I had to get control of my organizing baby. So I started writing down my "ideas" on a blog list, which I also shared with you here. That helped, at least then I had a list of ideas to pick from when I was staring at a blank screen.
This weekend was a complete whirlwind and didn't go like I planned, but it ended up being really great! Let's recap, shall we?
all you righteous
I played it . . .
Doreen Cronin – Click, Clack, Moo is my favorite picture book. Simple, to the point and hilarious. Her Diary of a Worm is an earth-turning good time!
To punish their success, the Obama administration is now seeking to hamstring the oil and gas industry further with a bevy of new taxes. The clearly impotent wind industry, on the other hand, may enjoy continued subsidization to the tune of $3.5 billion per year.
Pretty much every swatch I've ever seen from Depend has been a very "me" polish. If I ever go to a county that carries Depend, I'll probably buy one of everything. Why do mini polishes make me feel like having all of them is justifiable? (I'm looking at you, Essence.)
I was so excited after getting these samples built that I had to share them right away, just a couple quick snaps with the camera phone and thru the magic of the internet... there you have it! You saw it here first!

One thing about your more country hip hop clubs in the deep south is that they will let you bring in your own drinks. That also includes some strip clubs. Obviously you need to do a little planning so you can pick up the Sierra Nevada at the grocery store. In most places in the South you cannot buy alcohol after midnight at a store, some lingering Bible Belt laws. But for some reasons gas stations are okay, but who the hell wants to be stuck with a bunch of tallboys of Bud Dry. At least make it PBR.
If you’ve been to Charleston, South Carolina–(home to the College of Charleston)–you’ve likely heard about/seen the typical Charleston house, which has a porch alongisde the entire length of the building (on two floors). The slideshow images above were snapped on a walk I just took around the downtown area–gotta get out of the office sometimes (In one of the shots you can see that the porch has been retained for show near the front of the house while the back section has been walled in as extra interior footage). The porch is marked by a ‘false door’ or sorts, which in years gone by was left open to signal that visitors were welcome (well, that’s what they tell you on the tourist carriage tours at least).
If violets are the vanguard of spring in Wisconsin, the rearguard is the removal of flannel sheets. Each year they seem to stay on the bed a bit longer - last spring was so damp and chilly they didn't come off until June. In a drafty old house like ours (and with a thermostat kept as low as ours), there's nothing so cozy on a cold spring night as snuggling down under the fuzzy warmth of flannel - with a fleece blanket above, and a good weighty comforter to top it all off.
In the poorest part of this poor village lived an old woman, all alone, a widow of many years and without sons or daughters to care for her. But she was of a good heart, and every day she would tend her scrawny tea bushes in memory of her husband even though the other villages would laugh at her folly - for her tea was bitter. "Old Wife's Tea" they called it, and to this day in China, poor quality tea is named so.
In any case, here’s the review:
We communicate often. If he bumps his fingers, or isn't feeling well, or for whatever reason throws a tantrum to shame most well versed three year olds - she lets me know.
Our drinks arrived first, of course, and we were blown away. I’ve never tasted anything so delicate, complex, and perfectly balanced. I really wanted to hoover the whole thing. Mike was equally amazed at his beer cocktail. The bartender is apparently a pretty talented fellow – it’s worth the price of the drinks just to sit there and watch him work his magic.
I first learned this recipe when my boyfriend received a bunch of beets from his CSA. While he was excited, I cringed. Beets are those weird, imbetween plants that are too sweet to be what I conceive as a veggie, too squishy in texture to be a veggie, but not sweet enough to be a fruit. Basically, I don’t like them. That didn’t stop us from having a lot of them, so I had to figure out a plan. I set to my rule of thumb for produce–if you don’t like it in its own form, turn it into a baked good. For me, that’s muffins.
This week is Teacher Appreciation Week, and Sunday was a lucky day for many! It was the day of the very first Teacher Appreciation Jackpot, an amazing "blog hop" event involving over 140 bloggers!

"I do not come into this pulpit hoping that perhaps somebody will of his own free will return to Christ. My hope lies in another quarter. I hope that my Master will lay hold of some of them and say, 'You are mine, and you shall be mine. I claim you for myself.' My hope arises from the freeness of grace, and not from the freedom of the will."

Richard Goode’s contribution to the Southbank Centre’s International Piano Series offered almost unalloyed delight. Indeed, I should struggle – and see no reason why I ought to struggle – to find anything about which even to quibble from the first half, devoted to Schumann. The first piece of Kinderszenen welcomed us in, as if the welcome came directly – which, in a way, it did – from a wise and kindly storyteller. How was this accomplished, both here and later in the work? Through imagination, certainly, but also through well-nigh perfect weighting of every chord, and communication of the connections between every note. Memories of and sympathy towards childhood permeated performance and score alike. Pieces such as ‘Bittendes Kind’ and ‘Gluckes genug’ were delectable, thanks to Goode’s irreproachable tonal understanding. Voice-leading sounded impeccably natural, whilst judicious rubato made points without underlining. It is a cliché, doubtless, but ‘Träumerei’ proved the true, still centre to the work, not least to a marriage of pellucid, Murray Perahia-like tone with harmonic grounding that put me in mind of Wilhelm Kempff. Irresistible rhythmic impetus – and that includes harmonic rhythm – brought ‘Ritter von Steckenpferd’ to life. Goode’s placing of the opening chords in ‘Der Dichter spricht’ and his spinning of the line emerging therefrom brought a sense, despite horrendous bronchial contributions from sections of the audience, of magical reverie with direction. Sadly, some of the performance was blighted by noise from outside the hall: what sounded like drumming, at one point. But it is testimony to Goode’s performance that it rose above such distractions.
The mid-credits scene in “The Avengers,” as seen in international screenings, shows Thanos, the Marvel Comics god of death. It’s pretty strongly implied that Loki and his alien army were testing the Avengers for a future offensive on Earth by Thanos.
Caudalie Vinosource SOS Thirst-Quenching Serum. MARKETING BLURB – “This newly launched ultra-concentrated serum is extremely natural and plant-based, ensuring your skin never lacks moisture.” MY THOUGHTS – “Very liquidy and loose in the tube, making it difficult to keep hold of when you dispense it. Having said that it’s light on the skin and smells divine. One man’s serum is another man’s milky liquid.”

Years, and countless times later of Nan batting those words at me, I found I’d developed huge resilience, a staying power, a dogged determination that nearly matched her strong will. My never say never attitude served me well in my career, personal life, health – especially those times when ill-health threatened to ruin everything. And with the successes came confidence, and a belief that if I tried my very best and kept going, then maybe I could. Nan was right. There really was no such word as Can't.

In fact, the agency can only have got to be any good because of the zen-like ability of its creative directors to weather the inconsistencies of their clients' behaviour, as well as that of whatever minor muse it is that caters to advertising creatives.

I always carry my knitting bag along with me, making sure that the knit I am traveling with is appropriate to the trip. This past weekend we drove 3 hours to help my daughter and son-in-law move into their new apartment and to attend a wedding. Last week I printed this pattern. It was the perfect car project. It took me almost the exact length of the drive to make it (at a very nonchalant pace)! We were staying with friends and when I arrived, Sue put the vest on her antique bear and now, that's where it lives...
Donald’s willingness to experiment led him to designing and maintaining our web site, way before the National Church considered one, which opened up the Manuscript and Photographic Collections to the wider world as never before. The highly successful Mission Archives section on the site evolved as a result of the demand for these records by academic researchers. With only a paper listing of the collection and no real means of cross referencing, Donald set about rearranging and describing the collection to enable it to be entered into the electronic catalogue ‘Ark’. Along with the completion of the preservation of the Mission photos Donald’s knowledge of the ins and outs of mission activity in the Church enabled him to become ‘the authority’ for those inquiring about Presbyterian mission activity.

So, I’m not quite sure I’d be willing to pay a massive premium for an Apple television. Yes, I realize that I’ll have to pay a little extra for the Apple name, and as I’ve noted here before, I’m just fine with that. But if Apple tries to price itself out of the market, I don’t know if I can justify running down to one of its retail stores to pick up one of its televisions.

Last week I posted an article talking about why manufacturing is important and the research Brookings conducted on this topic. While there are economists that contend that manufacturing is not as important to the economy as others believe, there is certainty that specific states rely on manufacturing as an important part of their economy.
I don’t really have a vision, in fact (in fact, I’m legally visually impaired, true, with the guide dog, the white stick and so on, so, having a vision is not my thing, ah!). But, right now, for it can change in a few weeks – things are evolving quick, nowadays, I think that “music distribution” won’t change that much. I mean, for economic matters, one still will need distribution partners such I have with Season Of Mist in France, for example, to gather a lot of different labels’ physical stuff and offering them to the public and retail stores (I mean the one that’ll survive). It helps costs being kept low for everyone. Sure, large retails chains are suffering and it will get worse for them, but that’s no problem with me. I mean, I don’t care if you’re ordering on my distributor’s Web store or if you go to a shop: I’m having the very same amount of money back.
Eggs used as planters or vases is nothing new but this trio by Martha Stewart is so lovely. The lavender eggs really bring the whole look together. This is such an easy craft that can be quite beautiful. I have a few pastel egg cups I bought on clearance last year at Marshalls that I'm going to use to create my own look.
The design isn't anything to write home about, although I am a fan of the white borders.

After the bitterness, the anger, the guilt and despair are tempered by time, we look at life differently.

Review: I picked up this book in the first place for two reasons: 1) because the author’s Airborn Trilogy are among my favorite books of all time (and will finally be a movie after all these years) and 2) because I read the original Frankenstein for class this semester and found it fascinating.

They were dupes tricked into signing complicated loans they barely understood but were nevertheless sold on by 1) the promise of continuously rising house prices and 2) low key interest rates set by the Federal Reserve of the United States, the central bank of the U.S.
“It was Johnson who then stabbed Mary-Ann in the abdomen with a large brown kitchen knife. He had her by the neck and hair; she was begging him to stab her in the neck….Mary-Ann then fell on her side and Johnson was stabbing her everywhere. She fell over in a ball trying to protect herself but he rolled her over trying to find a new place on her body to stab her. They said they wanted her to die slowly. She became unable to move and just lay there crying, when she cried or made any sound she was stabbed again.”
Mix together the caramel, pecans and cinnamon. Spoon mixture into the apple cavities. Sprinkle the pastry squares with a little brown sugar. Carefully place each apple (stem side up) onto the center of each square. Moisten the pastry edges with a bit of water. Bring the edges of the pastry together pinching to seal around the stem. Decorate with leaves using leftover pastry.
The biggest high –point was one of my school visits to the US when a kid came up and said he’d never finished a book and hated reading but he loved Devil’s Kiss. One non-reader had been converted into a reader. That’s a big result.
Well, we can't change any of it, but I need to wish you happy birthday, and imagine giving you a hug. Know what happened to me today? I still wear your long pink and white cardigan and I hung it on a hanger on the laundry line to dry today. As I ran my hand down it to see if it was dry I imagined you in it, and gave it a hug, and flung the empty sleeves around my shoulders and tried to imagine you hugging me back. It didn't really work, you weren't really there. No, you are in my heart, in my thoughts, in my soul...today and always. Happy Birthday Mom, I love you.

For Sean the experience of this particular Scorpio Race provided a different outlook. From a young age Sean was running a HUGE horse operation. To have found and cultured your purpose in life at such a young age is disconcerting. For Sean these races are more about realizing he needed to work his gifts of his own accord rather than under the shadow of someone else.

During the month of December 2010, I was asked to do an interview after joining a wonderful Facebook page called HealthyPlace. I was contacted by a producer, she’d read my blog and wondered if I’d be willing to be interviewed about suicide. I was thrilled as this was something I’d wanted to do for some time, to get interviewed or solicited for my story as it’s a great way to help get the message out about suicide.
New England, post-hardcore group Vanna is currently wrapping up recording on their sophomore album, which is due out in early 2009. Produced by Steve Evetts (Story of the Year, Every Time I Die, Our Last Night) and mixed by Mike Watts, the yet-to-be-titled new album accentuates the band’s matured sound, reveling in a elevated mix of melody and hardcore.

Jesus Christ came as an extension of God’s Grace to His People. Through God’s Rich and Abundant Grace, the payment of our sin debt now moved mankind from forbearance to satisfaction. The penalty for sin has been paid in full by the Blood of Jesus Christ opening the door to a New Life living in close proximity with God. Grace should not be confused with God’s Mercy. These are very different things. Grace is a full pardon not just leniency. It is total satisfaction. There is nothing left owed. Mercy changes from forbearance or withholding the penalty to now a release of God’s Favor and Blessing. Grace changes God’s Mercy because now through salvation and the Blood of Jesus Christ to release divine favor and blessing into His Children’s lives. He can move closer. His Spirit works within as well as without in their life. However, without knowledge of such things we do not see our Father’s Love and Faithfulness in our life remaining in our sin rather than stepping into the freedom of God’s Mercy.
And so April has moved aside and taken the sun with her; May has been cold, cold, cold so far in our little bit of Cornwall with gusty winds which test the poor bud-burdened peonies almost to the limit. The poppies are faring even worse and look bedraggled and broken, the promise of the show about to come possibly being halted before it starts. Of course, this is a sad reminder that yet again I have not staked the plants, allowing myself to be fooled by the recent balmy weather - will I ever learn?

Beautiful night ride through the city yesterday! Went from the outskirts of Madrid in barrio Estadio Olimpico to Puerta del Sol in the center of the city. Though it was raining a bit, I loved feeling the wind around me and enjoying the scenery. It all became complete with my favorite Napolitana from La Mallorquina, tacos from the Mexican Taqueria de Mi Ciudad, and a bocadillo de calamares from La Casa Rua. Que bueno!!!
I was really proud that he would halt and stand still whenever I wanted. He always would look back at me like, "why are we stopping here" but I trusted him enough to pull out my phone and take a few pictures of him.

I have learned to forgive. I am learning to forgive. I will forgive. I don’t want to be bitter. I don’t want to live in the past and be bound to something from so long ago.

Pour the mixture into your popsicle molds. Freeze until solid (I like to freeze mine overnight). (If you use the paper cup method, pour into the paper cups and let freeze for a few hours, until the mixture can support the sticks, then insert them and continue freezing until solid.)

I believe Barack Obama was put into office to do what no Republican could ever have gotten away with.

Autumn with it's rich colors encourages us to embrace the vibrancy of the outdoors and what could be more complimentary than dances from Hungary? The textures and fabric of the music strike chords that equal the vivid crimsons, golds and russets of an autumn woodland landscape.

My favorite Bible verse is Philippians 4:8:
“I…” I found myself quite at a loss for words. I could see what, to my mind, seemed to be an irrational storm of anger brewing atop Mr. Tibbs bristling eyebrows. I could only stand and prepare for it to break upon me, as I imagined I had likely deserved for my violation of good manners.
That is some of the things we have been working on around here in order to be more prepared for whatever should happen in life. What is going on in your life? Do you try to be prepared?
Number 1 is a favorite in the Wurdibitsch house and is eaten year-round. Number 2 was a favorite from last year that came back for round two. I think the Granny Smith was too tart or I just remembered it being better. Number 3 was well-liked by everyone but made us all think of Reubens and then it was kind of sad. Number 4 was popular with half the folks and just "eh" for the rest. I think it needs a spicier meat (like pepperoni). It just seemed lacking some ooomph. Number 5 was a surprise dark horse. The blue cheese got several raised eyebrows and a couple, "I'll try it but I'm not promising anything." We thought it might be too strong a flavor for the grandgirl who was awake for the event but we were wrong. This was one of most liked sandwiches. Number 6 is like eating a soft, warm, dill pickle. Simple and delicious. Number 7 was surprisingly good, too. The pear was just firm enough to provide a little bite to the bite and the gouda (non-smoked) was perfect with it. Number 8 was boring. Butterkase is excellent by itself or melted or maybe with something else but it got lost in the crowd. Number 9 was also a nice surprise. The chipotle chili powder gave it just a little bit of a kick.

In the meantime, I've moved my gas kiln and am 95% finished with the shed. I'm calling a friend for back-up before I cut a hole in the roof for the chimney, but after we do that, it's a "go". Propane is scheduled for hook-up on the 22nd, and I'm hoping to have her loaded and ready to fire on Thanksgiving Day. It's been a year since I've fired, and I'm sure I am forgetting how much work I have to do to get ready, especially since the pots are at the gallery, the glazes all need to be re-sieved and the pots, glazes and kiln are all in three different places.

"Perhaps I can convey the ongoing reality of the poem's life more simply by recollecting a Saturday evening last August when I had the privilege of unveiling a memorial to Brian Merriman on the shore of Lough Graney in Co.

After an excellent fish pie lunch I was ready for more beer, but wanted something lighter in colour and more refreshing on the palate. Westgate Gold 4.2% from Clarks Brewery and Amarillo, a 5.0% from Crouch Vale both fitted the bill and were both in good form. To end with though I selected another Kent Brewery beer, the 5.5% Enigma. Described on their website as a black IPA, this was a style of beer I have not sampled before. Nevertheless it was a good one to finish on. Well-hopped, as one would expect, but dark and malty to balance this beer did not disappoint. My only regret was that the brewery's three regular pale ales/bitters had not been available for me to try.

Now I really am getting worried about this publisher. ‘After publication’? What kind of publisher sends out review copies and order detail sheets after a book has been published? Whatever happened to advance sales orders? Talk about putting the cart before the horse. Janus seems to be trying to put forward the tradition model of publishing, but with the Subsidy template. And you know what? The more I look at things; the more I am seeing the old publishing template of a vanity publisher. Say just enough to interest, but not enough to frighten off the customer.
It’s interesting to see what happens by simply putting relationships at the top of the agenda for team meetings; to spend some time talking about who’s in the person’s life, what’s going well with their relationships, and what more might be done to support this aspect of the person’s life. By talking about relationships for even a few minutes before getting into the rest of the agenda, the whole tone of the meeting starts to shift. Instead of focusing on how to get Mary’s mom to follow her diet plan, someone might say, “why don’t we invite Mary’s mom for dinner on Sunday?” The question of John’s sister coming by unannounced gets reframed from a problem into an opportunity: “John really enjoys spending time with his sister – what else could we do to facilitate their relationship?”

In church also, me and a lady was talking about making fluffy cookies and I mentioned ghee, quickly another (who heard us) said, "No... so smelly." So, I asked her why is it smelly? "It's made from Goat, too 'sou' (smelly term used to describe mutton)". When I told her, no, it's actually made from butter, she was surprised because she loved butter but hates ghee.

Your daddy and I had just arrived minutes before. I remember sitting, looking up at a clock, 2 am it read, while a nurse was asking me questions, and my throat hurting from thirst, her telling me "No, absolutely not! I could not have a drink, for I may vomit with the anesthesia and choke to death on the aspiration of water". That was no great concern at that moment; all I could focus my brain on was water, a drink.
Breathless is an unrelenting movie from the start – the main male character Sang-Hun dishing out two aggressive beatings – it doesn’t hold back on the punching and kicking. Filmed in a docu-drama style, there’s no glorification of the violence – this is all nasty stuff. Violence is never far in every frame. The structure of the movie may seems repetitive, moving in circles, as if to mirror the circle of violence that the characters are trapped in. The bullied child becomes the bully in adulthood; the victimised mother produces a traumatised daughter, a beating follows another beating and so on. Director Yang Ik-Joon (also the writer, producer and lead actor!) has crafted a movie that explores themes of domestic violence and its effects on people. After an uncompromising first hour letting the viewer astonished and weary of Yang-Ik Jook’s shock and awe approach, the director suddenly introduces a sentimental edge to the movie with an unexpected touching montage of the two main characters (the thug and the high school girl) taking the gangster’s nephew to the fair, where he can, at last, be a child again. The movie seems a bit loose and unfocused in the middle but it is a powerful movie for those who manage to reach the end. The ending works superbly in a series of flashbacks leaving room for hope. The transformation of Sang-Hun is quick, but remains believable. A martyr of child abuse, his will to change his ways and break the cycle will eventually kill him but save his family. It is a powerful conclusion to an overly brutal movie that leaves bruises like a punch in the face, but also handles its gentle moments with a disarming sincerity.

Oak Park and River Forest is ground zero for the outfit. Iaccardo grew up in River Forest, the long time head. As the Italian community moved west, they moved straight west. So you have Taylor Street. They didn’t want to live in the city anymore because they’re nice suburban guys. So right across from the city line, you have Oak Park. Then due west you have River Forest. Then a little bit later, Oak Brook- one more step. You have Elmwood Park, River Forest, a little west of Oak Park.

But mode is also quite a slippery concept in that it relates to the ways in which we understand other ideas about how texts are produced and received, so we use the notion of the mode continuum to talk about different dimensions along which we can place texts. The clickable graphic of this can offer you a few pointers as to which dimensions are most relevant at this level. You might have used different terms for some of these (e.g. asynchronous for delayed, or synchronous for immediate) but it's all the same really.

Yet, our meeting was, in many ways, the same as the biological birth meetings of our 5 prior children. Little Misiker walked up to us the moment we sat down to eat breakfast. We weren’t expecting him at the breakfast table. We weren’t on the lookout for him. He surprised us as much as any of our natural born children ever did. There he was, looking up at us, sizing us up, wondering what it meant to call us Mommy and Daddy (as the other Africans were encouraging him to do). There were other little children running around the room. So, we weren’t certain whether this little orphan was ours. No one told us he would be meeting us at breakfast. So, how could we know?
Bennett’s little feet measured in at 9 cm, and his body in total was about 20 inches (and he was born at 7 lbs, 9.5 oz). So my little wonton’s 6 cm foot doesn’t seem THAT crazy anymore, thankfully.

Sauteed in a red sauce with lots of onions it was so tasty. They also have tasty crispy tacos, but Angel admits that he has to do the shells in advance and so they are not the same as those that are deep fried with the filling inside right before serving.

What I did was anything current I'd keep in my Home Management Binder and then once paid, I'd file it into the expanding file folder, but I realize I keep up to date with - what's due when - easily by just making a note on my fabulous Home Management Wall Calendar instead! So then I just look at that and can easily check my expanding file folder to see any details (such as account number) if I need! Though honestly my calendar has so much space I put the amount due and anything I need there most times already!

Publishers still make a lot more money from the old print model than they do on digital subscriptions. Until the economics of that change, they don’t have much incentive to try to speed the shift. Bill Grueskin, a former editor of mine, now at Columbia University, joined some colleagues in producing an excellent report on the economic issues publishers face.
2. Kirsten Dunst, Melancholia – I’ve always though Kirsten Dunst capable enough, but nothing special. Cute, but not really hot. Likable, but not really charismatic. Okay in movies, but not a great actress. She blew me away in Melancholia (also got me to rethink the hot judgment). She gives a completely fearless performance as a woman lacking the ability to cope with daily life, who finds a kind of calm as the world around her falls apart. Dunst channeled her own history of depression into the role and worked with Lars von Trier, who’s known for putting his leading ladies through hell to get great performances out of them. The result is validation: Kirsten Dunst is a damn good actress.

A few of my students arrived to class today telling me that they saw the movie “The Raven” which just came out starring John Cusack. Just so you readers know, the movie does not follow the poem “The Raven,” however, the title of the movie fits because a raven was considered to be a messenger of death. Isn’t that charming? My students said they felt misled by the title, but they loved it!
Unfortunately, another series of events occurred as I slightly cut my finger while cutting up veggies for lunch. It wasn’t too bad, but I still thought that having a bandaid would be a good idea since I will be using my hands a lot in Body Pump training, and Brian and I didn’t have any bandaids at the apartment.

I figured I must be missing something, and thought surely they must have been popular for longer than I’ve seen, with a few more hits up their collective young sleeves, but nope. Looking over their Wikipedia page, they’ve got two big singles to their name, and that’s it. They appeard on the seventh season of The X Factor in the UK, originally as individual contestants in the “Boys” category, and this is an important point, were not good enough as individuals to make it through. It took former Pussycat Doll and all around moron Nicole Scherzinger to suggest that the five of them get together and enter the “Groups” category. Being young men and being captivated by her surgically enhanced rack, they took what she said on board.

Unfortunately we all treated East Pakistan as a colony and never granted them their justly deserved status of being the major human organ of Pakistan’s body – 54 percent of the population. As power barons of the Federal government mostly hailed from West Pakistan they never shared the power willingly or happily with their Bengali brethren.
Although the title might suggest the notion; this is not a discussion of feminism in Mad Men’s very male dominated industry. The inspiration is, in part, taken from the photograph above: a provocative portrayal of beautiful women and men perfectly accessorized and stylishly coiffed. The division of these individuals into feminine and masculine, light and dark, personal and professional, implies not only different natures and different worlds but a separate mystique.

Over the course of recent decades, the corrupt system of appointing the very people engaged in the crimes they are appointed, or hired to prevent, has accelerated beyond all reason. It is obvious at this point that the officials put in charge of hiring and appointing, are picking individuals with a pathological mindset for the very worst behaviors in this diseased age. Whether it is DHS, TSA, Child Protection Services, or any of the gamut of bloated and useless government agencies, they are specifically hiring criminals, perverts, troglodytes, serial sexual psychopaths and serial killers, for the very reason that they are what they are. There is no hyperbole or exaggeration here. That is how it is.

Once my grandfather bought twin outfits for Margaret and me, and Margaret refused to wear hers when I wore mine. It hurt me very deeply. I suppose she just wanted her own identity, and that was normal. But with all of the loneliness I felt, it was hard to accept. It seems that I was always seeking validation, and my sister was always angry (with good reason).
In preparation for the final races, McLaren have developed another iteration of their F-duct rear wing. The new version places the stalling slot onto the rear face of the main plane of the rear wing, where the previous versions had all placed the slot on the rear face of the flap. This is a subtle change and effects the way the wing stalls to create improve aero efficiency (i.e. more straight-line speed, or more downforce for a given top speed).

In the meanwhile, just keep in mind and hold dear to your heart that NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS (seo experts, search engines, online friends), you are ALWAYS better off by having quality unique website content or blog content. With this in mind, it would not hurt to go back through your blog posts and correct what you can. This can make a world of difference for someone using Blogger opposed to Wordpress or Typepad. Blogspot / Blogger does not have the same extensions and SEO capabilities as the other two blog platforms, therefore unique content and proper external SEO will help your Blogspot / Blogger rank better in the search engines.
A simple way is to include a social media call to action (CTA) within your traditional advertising creative. One or two CTA’s will work; anything more than that will overwhelm the consumer. The CTA needs to be clear and simple to drive consumers to your social media sites. Give consumers a compelling reason to seek your business/brand out when viewing your traditional TV commercial, print advertisement, or radio commercial. Entertaining online videos (youtube, vimeo, etc), contests, and exclusive rewards for followers can work as well.
In conclusion, the importance of our nation’s manufacturing sector cannot be overstated. Manufacturing provides high wage jobs that are essential to purchase homes and raise families. Manufacturers are at the forefront of invention and innovation. Manufacturing is a crucial component to address our trade deficit and reviving our economy. In short, manufacturing is essential to well-being and standard of living as a nation. We must continue find ways to strengthen our manufacturing sector both in Wisconsin and the U.S.

Issue 14 of Paracinema is now available to pre-order! Hard to believe that the magazine has been going for 14 issues. It has been independently published since 2007 and, as clichéd as it might sound, has got better with every issue. It’s also recently widened its net and is available in various independent retailers right across the length and breadth of the States. Cool stuff, eh?
The decision to save the Euro has been delayed for the last couple of years because it is so unpalatable to the Germans. They do not want to be on the line for the rest of Europe’s mistakes and, therefore, Eurobonds and a central eurozone finance ministry have been dismissed. But when push comes to shove and the ground beneath the euro looks ominously unstable, the euro powers have converged towards a closer Euro, not a more disintegrated one. This will be the path that follows. Europe’s leaders have a high pain threshold and will not be forced into doing things they don’t want to do unless a gun is pointed at their heads. The euro crisis gun is reloading and eventually greater integration will follow.

Some years ago, I wrote a poem about a moment in which God impressed upon my heart a prayer for our grandchildren. You can read the poem here: A Birthday Moment. (It had been a long time since I had read the poem, but I recently found it again "accidentally" while searching my blog for a poem by someone else.) This poem of mine was written about the four of my grandchildren who were present at the time. Now there are quite a few more!

I have had a subscription to People for at least 5 years. My mother and I split it and then I will get it and read it, pass it on to her and then pass it on to my gram. I used to go to Target every Sunday and grab at least 3 magazines while there, all of the magazines had the same gossip, same pictures, same articles practically but I still bought them. Not only was this a costly habit but it was kind of dumb to be buying three separate magazines to look at basically the same stuff.
When I was a kid, I would daydream about things like what my wedding would look like, how many kids I would have, what kind of house I would live in, what my job would be…stuff like that. It wasn’t until I actually became a mother for the first time that I actually formed a composite image of what I thought my kids would be like, personality-wise. Any one who has met my first child, Rebekkah, will understand how I might have assumed that all my kids would turn out this way. Rebekkah was one very serious, very stubborn, very intelligent child. I actually had to consciously teach her how to have a sense of humor. Thankfully, once she caught on, there was no stopping her. She loves to laugh. But because she was so intense, I naturally braced myself for my second child.

Well, in a way, that works.)

So because I have a minor obsession with fabric, I thought I'd do a little searching for some that might work for this project. As I have learned throughout the nursery design, it can be downright maddening to match a particular color exactly throughout a room. She's already done a great job of this by finding a dead on Tiffany blue match in a lamp from Home Goods. And while I didn't ask her what style exactly she was looking for in the chair fabric (modern? graphic? traditional?) these might be a good place to start.
Then all the way on the right...you know that face, right? Of course, that's Amanda from One Extra Degree, and she is the reason that we were all able to get together. I loved picking her brain a little bit about departmentalizing and how she handles finding enough time in the day to do everything when you are constantly switching homerooms. And any time you want to work in some craft time, Amanda, you let me know! :-)

This is tough. Here I am facing my own health issues of colon cancer, chemo/radiation treatments, two surgeries and just the stress of the health issues. Added to that is my Brother Chap Smathers who appears to be in the final stages of congestive heart failure. He is now in a nursing home where they are attempting some rehab programs, but there is no doubt this is the late stages of that disease. It just breaks my heart, I've known the man for over 60 years. He is truly like a brother to me and I love him dearly. Chap is one of those truly good hearted people you have the privilege of being close to.
The final argument on which the smooth transition idea rests brings us back to demand destruction. An economist will properly point out that people will stop using oil for some applications and will turn to alternatives where they are available. All that is true enough. But it is worth asking what they mean by "applications." In reality, it is the poor who will stop using oil for "some applications," both in industrialized countries and across the world. If alternatives are not available or are just as expensive, they will simply have to forgo the benefits of those "applications." That will help keep a lid on oil prices, but it won't solve the problem: too little oil for all the activities that power and feed 6 billion people.

Hugh B. Brown once said, “There are people fond of saying that women are the weaker instruments, but I don’t believe it. Physically they may be, but spiritually, morally, religiously, and in faith, what man can match a woman who is really converted to the gospel! Women are more willing to make sacrifices than are men, more patient in suffering, more earnest in prayer. They are the peers and often superior to men in resilience, in goodness, in morality, and in faith.” (Sept. 29, 1965.)
I had a great weekend, spending lots of time outside with my family. My husband is home for a week, and my hope is to enjoy it as much as possible! We had a fantastic dinner tonight with all kinds of goodies which I picked up at our town's new Farmers' Market. We had fresh caught swordfish on the grill, locally grown corn on the cob, and a deliciouis salad made with all locally grown produce. We topped the meal off with a lot of fresh blueberries and homemade marshmallows! Yummy! I am so happy to have a wonderful Farmers' Market within a few minutes of my house. To also make for a relaxing Sunday - I was able to get my Gallery Idol card for Round 2 completed yesterday, so that took a lot off my mind! You will be able to see my creative die cuts card tomorrow at 2 pm EDT when voting begins - wish me luck :). Thanks for stopping by today!

Did I worry about the throbbing pain? Whether or not my toe would heal straight or end up as crooked, arthritic mess of a toe? Did I worry about losing my toenail (ouch!) or all the end-of-summer trips to museums and beaches that I would miss with my kids without the full use of my foot?
Speaking to one bar owner in Bethlehem in the West Bank about his views on the future of Palestine, the demoralising effects of the Israeli occupation really hit, “Some people call this place a prison”, he said, “But I call it a zoo. People come and watch us suffer and leave again like caged animals. There is no hope for Palestine, there is no money here. Everyone with money is emigrating and soon we will have nothing left.”
The situation leads me to a lot of questions…
It's extraordinary to be able to look back in this way, as a historian examines primary source material. Grand themes in the pages: loves, lost and found, sex, marriage, birth, death. The world seen through the eyes of a schoolgirl, the growing up years, the years of uncertainty, dreams, desire, and loss, the quest for love and acceptance. My parents and grandparents are in there, all my family, from that precious time when I could still refer to them in passing, as we met often in the hall and I was always on my way to somewhere else, not really knowing how quickly things change and people leave, and that I should have stopped for a moment to listen and hear while I still had the chance; the new dress on its hanger was in no rush to be worn, and the boy could wait, slouching at my door. I could still refer to the dear ones dismissively, peripherally, when everyone was still together and alive and could be taken for granted.

In the above photo I have used a light blue color in the negative space which makes a 1st order color triangle with the red and yellow of the peaches. It is not a true color triangle, because the colors are 'broken', but the blue negative space brings the attention more to colors. Together with a soft backlight you get the impression of smoothness and silkyness of the fruit. And the colors still remain a fresh impression.
Democrats and Republicans in this year's election who think they can roll into office on the mantel of "change" may want to look at the example of William Lafayette Strong (mayor 1895-97), a reformer who swept in, cleaned up the city ... then watched it all fall apart again.

The Writing Project mattered to me. It showed me that I was not alone. I was valued as an educator, writer and teacher of writing. I learned from other teachers and they learned from me. I saw my classroom as an extension of the learning I did professionally. I took responsibility for my own learning and for the learning of my students. I realized that teaching and learning could be joyful events which fed into a community much larger than my own classroom. The Writing Project empowered me and gave me voice. That made all the difference.

Another thing I'm always telling you guys to do is to make sure your script builds. Make sure that each challenge in the script is bigger than the last. Most of the scripts I read go in the opposite direction. Writers throw everything into those first 45 pages then don’t know what to do next. So the rest of the script is one long balloon deflating.

While some authors believe that the Jesuits (who were suppressed by papal bull in 1773) used Weishaupt to perpetuate their rule, others state that he was seeking to overthrow their powerful hold on Bavarian. On a wider scale, he was convinced that the world would profit from the overthrow of all governmental and religious institutions in the world to replace them by a world-wide, yet secretive, committee of “initiates”. To acheive his aims, he would use Jesuit methods against the Jesuits.

Then this weekend, I traveled to Erin's house to try out some Shaklee products. So, as of now, she and I are no longer online friends. We are in real life friends! Yay! So, anyhow, I came home Saturday night to a mess that Hubby left for me from his preparation of the family's supper. (I ate at Erin's house that evening. Thanks again Erin and Dusty!) The house was empty when I got home. Hubby had arranged for the kiddos to spend the night at Grandma's house and he had gone to his friends' house for the evening, so there I was with a stove looking like this:
I had to chuckle last night - I showed my big flower card from yesterday's post to my hubby after finishing it and he said "It hasn't got any butterflies!"... ha ha! He knows me too well! Of course, I couldn't go two days in a row with no butterflies so I thought I'd share a card I made last night using some scraps left over from other cards. It uses the utterly fabulous butterflies dies available in the new mini catalogue:

We have always been the ones to sit back and listen to others' vacation memories and scroll through Facebook photos of friends and family sunning themselves by crystal-clear, blue ocean waters. Every year, Sophie would come home before March Break and tell us of the number of children heading off to vacations in the sun. Often, it was shocking how many actually were going away somewhere exciting. Seriously, we are not sure how others manage to tuck enough away to fund annual trips that extended beyond camping or the occasional night at a hotel in a nearby town.
Thunder showers and leaden skies have been the order of the week and I have sought birds that would sit still and frequent regular perches. My ISO stayed locked on 400 and shutter speeds hung in there around 1/250 seconds at best. In these dismal conditions we could not have picked a more entertaining pair of birds to study. Every twig and stick flown in to begin the nest building ritual was accompanied by a remarkably loud and melodic virtuosity. For a "little brown job" the House wren's bustling energy and charming sing song performances easily trumped May's other early arrivals even with their flashier neon plumage.
God could have deemed otherwise. In God’s plan, Jesus was offered wine for his throat, so why not a towel for his face? Simon carried the cross of Jesus, but he didn’t mop the cheek of Jesus. Angels were a prayer away. Couldn’t they have taken the spittle away?
Or is it a liberal definition that expands the commerce clause beyond the intent of the drafters of the constitution. The government argues that in the interstate commerce clause of the US Constitution, the Federal Government has the ability to define commerce as any commerce taking place or about to take place. They argue that due to the special circumstance in the healthcare/insurance industry they can use the commerce clause to regulate customers before they enter into an actual transaction. No one denies that commerce is taking place at the point of transaction when one person hands over cash for a good or service. Moreover, no one denies that if that transaction happens between two individuals living in two different states it becomes interstate commerce that can be regulated by the Federal Government. However, now the Federal Government wants to argue that those who may engage in a transaction in the future should be considered actively engaging in commerce now and therefore can be regulated.
Patience truly is a virtue. (Especially when there are only two service elevators for a building with 48 floors.)

They all got new toys yesterday. I wanted to play with them all :I But as Charlie pointed out, I was a grown up and grown ups didn’t have toys… but I suspect that was just a ploy to get me to hand over the bike I was playing with at the time.
Best and worst writing tip you’ve learned?
The developers need an zoning change unusual to the low-scale area to make the buildings happen, and there's plenty of opposition, including the Cobble Hill Association and two groups called the Baltic and Warren Street Neighbors and the Columbia Waterfront Association. However, the developers come armed with a pre-certified ULURP (uniform land use review process), which mean in the words of Craig Hammerman, CB6 District Manager, that "they’re pretty much ready to go, and that the application would be certified not too long after our meeting."
In the fuzzy days of my youth, something new always was seen as a good thing. The promise of new technologies, new techniques, new inventions was a better life and ever increasing standard of living, for everybody. My whole life has been…well…about new.

In India, near-annual pushes by members of Parliament to make yoga compulsory in schools have riled Muslim parents who feel it bridges on indoctrination. When a Parliament member proposed to insert yoga into most curriculums in 2010, wording was included to exempt things like madrasas, or Islamic schools. Four years ago, a council of Malaysian Muslim clerics issued a fatwa against yoga, declaring it haram, or forbidden by Islamic law. The ruling followed similar edicts in Egypt and Singapore, where one of the earliest bans was issued in the early 1980s.

As I travel, talk to people, those of nationalist or patriotic persuasion and those that are not I find almost universally one thing in common an intense and almost palpably growing anti-Muslim worldview, with dismay I look to those around me and see the managed. There was a time when nationalism addressed our greatest threats, primarily finance and those who wield its power and thereafter the symptoms of such, such as mass migration, criminality, drugs, our declining and now sadly gone, manufacturing base and other such issues and indeed for a time nationalism had the street, be it the common man or those who would physically contest malevolency. I hear many, many suggestions from fellow nationalists and quite a few from those of purported other political persuasions ,as to how best to proceed, how best to solve the many problems besetting our society, nearly all of which entirely miss the mark.

Another option, which is in our training plan, is to run intervals. At a track we would start with running 400M x 4. For the next interval Active.com says we would, “Increase the number of 400s every week by two more until, 10 days before the race, the final workout is: 14 x 400. Each 400 (one lap around a track) should be run eight seconds faster than you want to average per quarter mile in your 5K race.”

A new venture in jewellery retailing initially targeted women between 18 and 49, but found that most of their buyers were men who saw the chain as useful for selecting a gift but had a highly unsatisfied task of ‘presenting the gift in an interesting way’. The jewellery chain zeroed in on an opportunity to sell men great gifts, by helping them find the perfect way to make a surprise gift presentation.

The Amtrak came at 6:50 a.m., and then it was a little over an hour to Union Station. The Amtrak is really nice — quiet, and calming. And this morning, I was so tired, and it was so cold and dreary, that the chug chug chug of the train just lulled me to sleep (I could get used to that). From Union Station, it was a short 15-minute walk to the office and boy, did it ever wake me up. I didn't wear a coat or have gloves or a scarf, and it was brisk out!

The physical side of a relationship includes attraction and sexual satisfaction. This category is self explanatory. Are you attracted to your partner? Does your partner satisfy you in the bedroom? Overall, this tends to be the least important category in a relationship. Some people tend to over look this category if the other two categories are being fulfilled. It really all depends on the person, the goal is to find out what your needs are. If you have to be attracted or sex is important to you, this category will probably be at the top of your list. But be careful, many people fall in love with the physical and realize, when it’s too late, that the other two sides of the relationship aren’t being met. The physical side of the relationship tends to be the “trouble seeker” in relationships for that reason. Over the years, I’ve come to realize that people tend to confuse love and lust. So just make sure you aren’t in lust with your partner but in love with them.

As you might have guessed I make a lot of sugar cookies. Here is my no fail recipe, it's true you really can't mess this up. I love this recipe because it gives you room to play. Use more extract or less, use just vanilla or just almond it's totally up to you. I like a splash of milk or I should say my son prefers his cookies with a splash of milk, but it really isn't necessary so if you don't like milk or just plain ran out of it, no worries.

With no cell phone reception and no occupied cabins close by, the girls prepare for a night of pot smoking, story telling, and beer drinking to celebrate their upcoming graduation from high school. Early tensions begin to bubble as the girls hint to each other about hidden feelings, petty jealousies, and back-stabbing confidences. Their last hurrah is shattered when a man enters the cabin, claiming to have been squatting there for 8 years.

Neighing with excitement and fear,
I returned to work and within a month I started to feel tired and had little energy to function. I thought this could all be attributed to my new duties of being a mom and heading back to work. I went to my physician for a series of tests. On November 21, 2005, I was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma. This is a type of cancer found in the lining of the lung, and is caused by being exposed to asbestos.

I went to the front of the library to get a cup of coffee because I was sitting next to the window and I was freezing my butt off. Of course when I stood up, I accidentally ripped my ear buds out of my computer and Major Tom by Peter Schilling blasted throughout the silence of the library. "4, 3, 2, 1..." Yep, I'm just classy that way.
(3) “Old Habits”- Personally, my favorite song from this album is “Old Habits,” since the song cleverly compares dealing with lost love to dealing with ending an addiction. This message is adeptly demonstrated in the lyric “I kicked the habit of smoking back some time ago & I tried the hard stuff, but I had to let all that go. But the toughest thing I ever gave up was today, & old habits like you are hard to break.”
Despite being one of my long days, and even longer than most Mondays, yesterday was actually pretty good. Theory went as usual. I’ve been doing really well in theory this semester; all of our recent stuff has been on “integer notation”, that is to say, music with numbers instead of note names, and I’ve managed to wrap my head around it really well, so I’m thankful for that.
I'm not even sure I've had a washed rind sheeps' cheese before but like most sheeps cheeses it wasn't quite as rich as cows' cheeses - a benefit when you have the unctuous texture of a washed rind cheese to contend with. As you can see it was in perfect condition - wonderfully rich and savoury, but not over the top flavour-wise. So not particularly 'stinky'.
DAY 29– Love’s Motivation
When you think of going into business, what comes to your mind? Most people conjure up visions of a brilliant idea and building a company from scratch—successful for some but not usually without deep pockets, substantial risk and a workaholic lifestyle. There are no existing customers, no sales and little to no immediate revenue. You need to market your business, hire and train employees and hopefully establish a cash flow… all without a track record or reputation to go on.

I have recently been doing research on one of the greatest artist/sculptors of our time, Alexander Calder. Not only did he create a whole new form of art--MOBILES, he also was responsible for making us understand that art did not always have to succomb to the pull of gravity, that sculpture could be "light," it could take flight. (I put light in quotes because many of his monumental mobiles weighed tons.)

Have you ever seen the movie Chariots of Fire? I remember seeing this film as a kid. Forget the fact that I fell asleep during the middle. But the end…whoa. If slow motion running doesn’t put goose bumps on your epidermis, well…never mind.
This, I discovered, was the third reason I enjoyed the V&A. They focus less on Art and more on art. The collections are filled with handiwork, everyday stuff rather than fine art — I'll stop short of saying "crafts." Thus, they have a lot of tea items in house.

Work is creating a big decision for me right now. I have to decide next week if I'm coming back next August. I love a lot of what I do... you know... the actual work and teaching part... but I'm so tired of the politics, two-plus hours a day on the road getting there and back, picking up the slack of others who aren't doing their job, but getting the same pay... and raises have been non-existent most of the last decade... they did give us a one percent raise the same year they took away our three-percent retirement match... but, hey, I do have a job.

I didn’t have a way to process that, I couldn’t wrap my mind around the thought. I called my girlfriend who lived around the corner and asked if I could come over. I stayed there until lunch time when they would release my husband from his ship so he could come home. When I got back home I saw a package had been delivered to our steps. It was addressed to me from Mom.
I just found out this evening that one of my favorite bloggers, Jen of Cakewrecks and Epbot, is going to lose her hair because she's sick. She's asking for all of her girl geeks to find her nifty hats online that she can buy and wear to cover her impending"chrome dome." That's cool. I'm definitely a girl who appreciates a good hat.

Art and his family are invited on a fantastic free holiday to the exotic Asteroid Belt - in a remote part of space near Mars.

What is behind these bizarre goings on? It's up to Art, Jack Havoc and Myrtle (against her will) to get to the bottom of things. But the giant sand clams and man-eating starfish which roam freely are nothing compared to the True Enemy, which is cunning, sinister, and almost unstoppable, and may resemble a hat ...
By now others were shopping in the store too. I was busy helping everyone I could. As one woman finished up her shopping she came up and had that prom dress in her hands. She comment on how beautiful it was and how that other woman was right about the flaws only being beauty marks. She acted so excited to be purchasing the dress. My heart sunk for the mom who wanted to save up for it. My mind went right into judgment of the lady buying it as she had heard how much this young mom wanted it. I thought to myself while still smiling what a rotten woman. While paying she gave me the extra to pay for the little boys snow boots. I quickly figured out what was happening and instantly thought how quick I was to judge. This woman had just purchased the dress and the boots for this young mom. She asked me to bag them up and give them to the mom after she left. She wanted me to tell the young mom Merry Christmas early. I had just witnessed the miracle of such a kind heart. How often do you think this kind of thing happens in a big department store? Maybe it happens more then any of us know. All I know is it was a moment in time that I saw pure kindness without the woman needing to be acknowledged. She left with just the feeling inside herself knowing she did a good deed. I am now working hard to not pass judgment on others.

The next morning we got up & headed on our way to Athens. It took us about four hours to get there. We drove back by My Olympus on our way down & it was a beautiful day. At about half way there we stopped at a rest stop. Even the food at the rest stop was very good. There were a bunch of tour buses there that were grabbing some lunch too. It was interesting because each bus seemed to be different types of tourists; ones that were Greek, ones that were Germans, etc.

This jewel of a mini-series remains the gold standard of Tudor television for me with Glenda Jackson's dead-on portrayal of the brilliant and mercurial Elizabeth I from powerless princess to confident monarch. It also started a period where my elementary school classmates believed I was deeply crazy.

The buildup to this social and political breakdown, especially with in the GOP, began when the Right began to assert itself and decided that the Republicans of the Center and Left were not needed and that the message of the GOP must be much more conservative, even to the extent of alienating the other members of the party. This alienation or narrowing of the ideology of the GOP is damaging to the party as a whole. It drives people away from voting for candidates on issues they may agree with; but cannot accept the philosophical and moral judgments being professed because they are in direct violation of their values, or even those they disagree because of the perceived threat to the liberties of all Americans.

I wish I could say that their proregressive paths had taken them into, and left them in, the past... but sadly, that's not the case, they are very much alive and kicking right here in the present day. Proregressives don't lead forward into the future, or the past, but instead they turn the future into the worst of the past, such as how they recently, in early 20th Century Brown Shirt fashion, sought out FreeMarketAmerica and Chris Loesch to be silenced for the crimes of disagreeing with them.

He also said, “I do think it’s important and useful to have a broader debate about our drug laws.”

Of course I couldn’t leave this post with saying something about the REAL tourist shopping: Wangfujing Street, which is their famous shopping street. Similar to New York’s 5th Avenue or Chicago’s Magnificent Mile, Wangfujing is energetic and vibrant, even, or maybe especially, at night.
The service was flawless and the staff seems to have a solid grasp of the cocktail menu - having both a real familiarity with the drinks and being able to suggest based on tastes. They're using some interesting and unusual ingredients (eucalyptus water, fresh wasabi, egg whites, jasmine syrup) and beautiful garnishes (many of which are meant to be consumed to add to the experience of the drink). They're even doing Cointreau Caviar.

Earlier in the year, once I had added the contents of the compost bins, along with some horse muck and spread it over the veg plots, I then sprayed it all with activated EM (or garden Yoghurt) and covered it with a large plastic sheet. This was to get some warmth into the soil and help the EM do its bit. When I later came to rotovate the soil, it was wonderfully friable. The plastic sheet went back until a couple of weeks ago, once the sun finally arrived.

Ed. Note: As (the short version of) the story goes, Deepak Chopra was speaking at a California Institute of Technology event and afterward was approached by a fellow who “offered to teach him about quantum physics.” The fellow was Leonard Mlodinow, a well-traveled physicist, former professor at Cal Tech, former Hollywood writer and computer game designer, and now a full-time author. This initial confrontation began an exchange that led to War of the Worldviews, a dialogue of respectful disagreement on a wide range of topics, from whether the universe is conscious to the roots of our humanity and the connection between mind and brain. What follows is an abridged excerpt of their opening comments. (Chopra and Mlodinow will be on tour the month of October; go to DeepakChopra.com for a schedule, as well as to see a new series of video Q/As—also on Chopra’s Global YouTube Channel.)
Really, as the name suggests, Rollicking Tales is inspired by the old pulp magazines of the early part of the 20th century. I want to capture the sense of excitement these publications conveyed. My aim is the same as theirs was, to package great stories as inexpensively as possible and make them available to a wide readership. With the advent of digital books, and the increasing technology behind printing this is becoming more possible by the day. I think a new era of pulp is around the corner, and Rollicking Tales is here in the vanguard.

It’s a powerful blend of melodrama and comedy with some stunning scenery (Charles Rosher’s black and white cinematography is great) – and it has the theme of man battling against the elements which is so central to many of Wellman’s movies. The film was made at a time when Hollywood crews were starting to venture beyond the backlots and filming on location – it was one of the biggest productions to be made in Washington state and I found an essay online which describes the economic impact of the filming and the excitement it caused in the area at the time.

Being a mother and woman of God can sometimes weigh us down so deeply with concerns, crisis, worries, needs of our children, demands from others, and expectations of organizations. Without quieting ourselves before God, we become so full, and yet so very empty.

Let me start by saying, I've never been a fan of throwing 'character' parties for my kids, but since Jack is into all things Thomas the tank engine, it was the likely choice of themes. I tried to keep the decor more vintage train but I had to throw in some Thomas for the birthday boy.
But one matters in other things too. One word can make a person’s day. One smile to a stranger could make or break that person’s decisions. One hug can heal wounds. One word “love” in particular, has a huge impact on those that say it and those that receive it. One moment can change a lifetime.
I often find one question helps a lot of adults, who maybe disagree with this view, to be more open minded: Do you remember you first true love? Do you ever wonder what your life would’ve been like if you had stayed together? For some, the answer is a resounding NOT INTERESTED, but for others … the pause says it all.
Ah, yes, now I remember. That’s it.

He has gone off to secondary school today - this boy is growing up far to quickly for my liking. How can I have a child who is at college when I am so young myself (I am 25 in my head :-)). He seemed very happy going off, not too nervous at all which is wonderful, I hope he loves his new school. I managed to sneak a little kiss on him before he ran off for the bus, he is nearly too old for kisses :-( Little Sweetpea and Middle Sweetpea are under strict instructions not to grow any more :-)

Nevertheless, I’ve found a few semi-promising web sites that vow they can teach me the game–I’m told the rules are simple, a point I could argue enthusiastically–but so far I’ve only got the faintest overview of it all. There are some online versions of the game I can get involved in, but I haven’t tried any of them yet. I’m still trying to figure out what in tarnation is going on! I don’t want to give my opponents too much of an edge and I don’t want to get stomped my first game, but if I’m playing a computer, there’s really no way around it. So, onward!

The fear of a below-par performance is misplaced; would a player want to be tarred with the brush of what is essentially, corruption? More iniquitous in the loan system is that wages are partially paid by clubs in the same division. Arsenal are as culpable of this with the players loaned out but it is this rather than team selection which is the biggest issue. Making clubs focus their attention on wages is part of the much vaunted but soon to be ill-fated, FFP regulations introduced by Uefa.

My mom, for example, thinks she has the ability to make me call her because sometimes when she thinks of me, I do call her. But I call her all the time, and she probably thinks about me often. She just remembers when the two overlap and forgets all the times she thinks of me and I don’t call, or all the times I do call and she wasn’t thinking of me. Selective memory and confirmation bias.
I got a new camera! My digital camera hasn’t worked for a few years now. I’ve done a lot of research and read a lot of reviews so I could get the right camera for me. Last week, I finally bought a camera. It’s a Kodak Easyshare Z612 6.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Zoom. Sounds fancy, right? It came out a few years ago, and it’s about $300 – 400 refurbished.

Final result
I greatly savoured the scenic riverside view together with the fresh morning breeze. The Presidential Palace exuded refreshed power under the morning sun. The Metekhi church and King Gorgasali’s statue gloriously remained impressive in real life as they were in pictures. The old bridges, joined by an ultra modern pedestrian walkway, magnificently cast their reflections on the calm waters. The traditional balconies, a distinct architectural feature I greatly enjoyed (My series on Georgian balconies here), insatiably viewed the river from above the cliffs. The decision to walk along the banks was more than worth the effort. It was a treasure trove of lovely pictures as I expected.

First, Monica Kuebler. She published Vanishing Hope and she was the first one to urge me to develop some sort of web presence. She also told me not to worry about posting about “writing stuff” all the time. So if you want to blame someone for the shit stories and the vasectomy stories, etc…blame Monica. She started it.

The company is committed to a positive patient experience and strong community partnerships.
And onward to that aforementioned one memorable moment of Deadly Prey. Should I spoil it? Let me put it this way: This may be the only film where you will see a man's arm being used as a bludgeoning weapon after it has been dismembered from his body. It's the only time in this cheesefest that I found myself laughing out loud, and possibly the only bit of inspired awfulness in what is an otherwise just plain bad, bad movie—and not even all that fun bad, either.

Making amends may take different forms from imprisoning the perpetrators of violence and those who instigated the violence to bringing compensation to those who suffered some harm. It may just take the form of a simple apology from the leaders and the perpetrators to those they harmed. Whatever form it may take it is a necessary component in a restorative process for a nation that was wrecked by political violence.

I love bread. My dad loves bread too. When we were growing up we would usually have an early dinner on the weekends. Sometimes my dad would buy a baguette and on a Saturday or Sunday evening my mom would slice it up, toast and butter it. It would be an evening snack. I remember me and my brother would be watching tv and my mom would be at the dining table buttering up the bread. These baguettes are super easy to make. The original recipe is from the book Artisan Breads in 5 Minutes a Day. I found this recipe at Good Life Eats. I was amazed at the thought of freshly baked bread taking so little time...well it didn't exactly take 5 minutes. The active prep time is probably around 5 minutes but there is an initial rising time of at least 2 hours. Then after shaping your dough it must rest for 20 minutes and then it bakes for 25 minutes....so this recipe is not going to give you a loaf of bread in 5 minutes.

Last week I started working on pictures and scrapbooking for the boys. I figured at some point childhood memories would be good. It was my first photo printing, other than Christmas cards in years, I kid you not. Digital has made me really bad at that. Hopefully w/ local prints for 15 cents each at the grocery store w/ childcare (yeah, I need to write a post about this awesome Rochester feature), I'll get better at this.
I used parenthesis on the word "problem" deliberately as the total amount of fraud HMRC is hoping to minimise is estimated (at their "implied midpoint") to be in the region of £500 millions in lost beer duty and some £130 millions from spirits for the year 2009/10. By my reckoning that comes to £630 millions in lost duty due to fraud by illegal importing and resale in the whole of the UK.. According to the Office on National Statistics the population of the UK in mid-2010 stood at 62,262,000. So the loss per capita is roughly £10.12.

This is one trait I have found across all runners I have met. Runners are (mostly) great people! I have met so many wonderful runners at races, through running clubs, and through the running/blogging community. Runners respect one another. Think about it...when you are out for a run, and you see another runner, don't you just want to wave?? And how about this: "An exercise physiologist can essentially prove that a 4-hour marathoner works harder than a 2 hour marathoner." Running a marathon is running a marathon, no matter how fast it takes you to finish.
Acts 17:25
Chapter Two is titled “Pain (Chaos Reigns).” It is during this section of the film that He subjects She to a course of exposure therapy. She must walk on the ground, confront the woods and come to terms with her fear of nature. In Eden, as it turns out, all is not well. We come to find that nature is cruel and excessive in the suffering it demands. A deer is spied with a stillborn fawn hanging limp from its birth canal. A wounded, bloodied fox lies dying in the grass and barks “Chaos reigns!” The oak tree standing next to their cabin drops hundreds of acorns onto the roof, reminding them that in order for one tree to thrive, hundreds of acorns (its babies) must die. A baby chick falls from a nest, helpless and covered with ants, only to be snatched up and eaten alive by a passing bird of prey. This is nature, “red in tooth and claw.” As She tells her husband, “Nature is Satan’s church.”

To go back to nature does not mean rejecting and disregarding modernity and technology completely. Rather, it is about striking a balance – a balance between humanity’s contribution as a result of modernization, and its effect on nature and ramification on the total system.

I was not sure if I was going to blog about this or not, but here I am. I havent been feeling like myself the last two days, and my mind has been wondering like crazy. I got my LSAT score in, and I did awful. Unfortunately, its not a good enough mark to get into law school for September 2011. I tried so hard, that it hurts to look at that score, it really does. I know I can re write in June, and I am going to, but its just one of those things that still sucks. Writing this blog brings tears to my eyes because I feel so discouraged, dissapointed, sad, and angry. I studied since July, maybe not as hard as I should of, but I really did put my mind to it, and what went wrong? I'm not sure.
I want to thank Marie Claire Magazine for accurately labeling Janet as a woman of transsexual experience in your marketing text, instead of problematically calling her transgender. For you see, transgender is a sociopolitical term which is reserved for people who do not conform to gender, such as drag queens/kings, cross dressing and transvestite males, gender queer activists or gender non-conforming people who identify with their physical sex. Janet is absolutely none of these things. She is a heterosexual woman who was born with a medical condition; she is NOT a stage act or fetishist.

But the second reason happened during the interview. I sat down and put on the headphone, he said a couple of nice things, I said more nice things, and we were on. And he said my last name perfectly. It really isn't that hard a last name, but that does not keep people from messing it up all the time. They miss the first "S" or they turn the "nan" in the middle into "noh" or they add an R or L sound for reasons that aren't entirely clear.
I thank Bridgette and Jen for their talent, friendship, patience, and inspiration throughout these 2 1/2 years.

We’ll be able to make and over nighter out of it.

The summer I was nine, my brother and I were excited about an upcoming family vacation to Opryland, a country music-themed amusement park in Nashville that was eventually leveled to become Opry Mills, a huge shopping complex. I could have cared less about the prospect of possibly getting to see some of country music’s greatest legends; I was ecstatic about one thing and only one thing: roller coasters. Ryan, being scared of heights, was not. If he didn’t get over this, I’d be stuck in a bumper car for the better part of the day.

“That was a first-time event for me,” said Gardner, who patrols the Pembroke area. “I’ve heard people tell stories about coyotes coming into an area where they are calling turkeys, but then running off when they realize what they’re hearing are hunters, not turkeys.

Bianca, although a little too snarky at times in my opinion, was a funny and strong female lead. She loves her friends and carries herself well despite the inner troubles she faces inside - and at home. Although her relationship with Wesley was a roller coaster ride to say the least, I couldn't help but route for the feuding duo. All throughout the novel, I definitely saw a Pride & Prejudice type relationship between Bianca and Wesley, which was humorous to watch unfold.

If you’ve seen those shows on TV featuring animal hoarders who usually see the light and reform, you know what a sad situation hoarding really is. Like Mamie, many real hoarders don’t set out to harm animals but to save one, then ten, then dozens. The problem is they don’t have the room to do it, nor the money to keep the animals well fed, nor the resources to keep the environment clean. Lauren is horrified when she visits Mamie’s shelter and sees how awful it has become. She calls the authorities--as she must under LA policy--and has the animals taken away. Mamie, too, although officials real and fictional generally realize how fruitless it is to prosecute hoarders for animal abuse since they often have mental issues and they’re almost always recidivists --they do it all over again.

Yet for such a personal upheaval, Yvon's turn to high crime is so calmly presented that this development seems but a natural progression for the man. Bresson even manages to fluidly tie Yvon's progress to that of the clerk who denied knowing him after taking money from the photo shop owner. The young man, Lucien (Vincent Risterucci), resents the owners for making him lie; having committed one crime in perjury, he finds it easier to commit others, chiefly skimming from the top by charging shop customers than the products are supposed to be marked and pocketing the difference. When the owner confronts him, Lucien calmly says, "I thought dishonest people had an understanding. As with Yvon, Lucien's wounded pride gets him fired, but unlike Yvon, Lucien takes care to bring copies of the store and safe keys with him. Lucien is no more animated than Yvon, but he makes for a more abrasive doppelgänger. Both men naturally progress to crime because of the capitalist system that sways them, but Lucien, who receives benefits from that system to maintain order, rebels more consciously. And when the former clerk arrives in prison, Bresson uses the same shot setup of him getting off the bus that was used to show Yvon entering prison.

I know you get somewhat overwhelmed or even scared at times, but you have the word of God to comfort you. You have the promise of a King to never leave you in the dark and unknown. Oh won’t you just trust Him? Open your heart and sing How Great Art Thou God, with me. For He is worthy. If I don’t have a dime it is okay, because my riches are in Christ who shall supply ALL my needs. Therefore, my riches are in His promises not paper bills or coins.
On the Ancient Lost Treasures forum in 2004 a member ( Tom Walter ) contacted the Gosford History group and was told the carvings were done by a schoolboy in the 60's , the Elvina group has recently contacted members of that group who verified the story again in 2010.
With all the 19 songs within two hours they played on last Wednesday night, I am quite sure that every body who came was pleased with the band’s performance. The rain, which was suddenly pouring on their 16th song, Anata, also didn’t stop the fans from enjoying the concert. Some fans thought that it was such a perfect coincidence as the ballad felt more moving in the middle of the rain. Even nature seemed to be drowned in the mood and ‘cry’ in happiness because of this absolutely amazing band.
Then last week I received a lovely email from Betty. She's a grandma betty like my grandma betty! And she wanted to crochet hats for children and teenagers with leukemia and wanted to know where she could find some free patterns. I have a cute and easy pattern here which I wrote for Samaritans Purse. Ravelry is also an amazing search engine in itself. I found a couple of lovely free ones here, here, here and here. And I couldn't go past this baby one here. Seriously cute.
That's not to say we're not finding and enjoying new things, of course; I promise to do a better job of keeping up and keeping you all in the loop!

Gervais and Norenzayan’s research is based on the idea that we possess two different ways of thinking that are distinct yet related. Understanding these two ways, which are often referred to as System 1 and System 2, may be important for understanding our tendency towards having religious faith. System 1 thinking relies on shortcuts and other rules-of-thumb while System 2 relies on analytic thinking and tends to be slower and require more effort. Solving logical and analytical problems may require that we override our System 1 thinking processes in order to engage System 2. Psychologists have developed a number of clever techniques that encourage us to do this. Using some of these techniques, Gervais and Norenzayan examined whether engaging System 2 leads people away from believing in God and religion.
I've actually been writing something different recently. It's an Upper YA (16-19) paranormal read. I was making good progress— as those of you on twitter might have seen— and I got the manuscript up to 7,000 words in 3 days. Unfortunately, MS Word decided to corrupt my file. (I posted about this error on facebook, here.) I lost most of the manuscript. I haven't got around to building that word count up again yet; I don't have to time any more. Which brings me onto my final subject...

Since having children I've been wanting to live a "greener" life and reduce my carbon footprint on the planet. I guess it became more important to me when the kids came along because I'd like them (and hopefully their kids) to be able to enjoy the environment around them for many years to come. I've decided to "Make a Pledge With Energizer" and the Five Kind Acts I'll be doing are:

If the Rights Police rang the bell tomorrow telling me they were taking away the ones that allowed me to speak my mind would it change my life dramatically? No, not really. Most of the time though by the time my mind has figured out what it’s thinking the time has passed anyway – I think what I’m saying more times than not is a not-yet matured thought. By the time it’s good and ready, dressed for the party and to leave my head, the party is shut down already and everyone is tucked up in bed at home.
During his speech at his wedding, this same friend talked about reading the Harry Potter books with his family. He said he always looked forward to those nights and the discussion that laid ahead. He ended the speech by thanking his parents for not only allowing him and his brother to read the books but for the opportunity to discuss them as a family and instilling in them their family values, while discovering his own ethics and ideas of courage, loyalty and friendship, hoping someday he could do the same with his own family.

We are going to talk about #3 since it is the most realistic. When I started out in my career, I had a few good trophies under my belt but nothing to shout out from the mountain tops for. I didn’t have TV experience, I didn’t even know how the industry worked. But what I did have was drive and sales experience. Most of us look at some big name guys that their careers are carried by big industry these are your “Realtree” “Mossy oak” guys without taking anything from their achievements this is the fairytale version of having your own hunting show and as you could imagine it is the hardest to obtain. The reality of it all is you need to put a lot of time money and effort into producing a few shows, paying for some air time on your own so you have something to show potential sponsors. Most big name sponsors wont look at you if you don’t already have a show contract on TV.

When My Man and I got married we thought we would have three or four kids, depending on how things went. Columbus grounded me and gave me a sense of worth I never knew existed. I liked being a mom to him, and I liked how it made me feel about myself. We had our second, and then our third, and then the first set of twins. It was busy and chaotic, but I loved almost every minute of it. With each new arrival I demanded more of myself, determined to keep our lives as normal as possible. I never wanted the kids to resent my yen for wanting lots of them.

Bad news today for the McInerney group which has been under examinership protection for nearly four months. The Irish operations of the group had been hoping to obtain approval from the High Court of a scheme of arrangement which would have seen a substantial investment from US funding group, Oaktree Capital and NAMA taking a substantial writedown on its loans to McInerney. Unfortunately in the High Court earlier today, the judge, Mr Justice Frank Clarke is reported to have rejected the proposed scheme of arrangement and the expectation now is that a receiver will be appointed to the group’s Irish operations where NAMA will be the biggest creditor. The judge said he would issue his formal ruling in the matter on Friday 14th January 2011.
It’s a quiet evening at home; Beulah is sleeping on my lap and I’m watching old episodes of “Frasier” (strangely comforting) and resting my tired legs after a hard hour of running earlier.

I feel like every time I look up it’s the weekend again – and no complaints there!

Ryan uses language beautifully; the true horror of the Unconsecrated (never zombie) is revealed slowly. Mary has always known them, as they claw at the Fence, moaning, a constant soundtrack in her life. "...I hear a familiar clank. It is the sound of the Unconsecrated pulling at the fence. Looking around, I realize that I have come up in a small clearing far away from the village that is protected by a ring of fence twice as tall as I am. The Unconsecrated are beginning to swarm around me. Two steps in any direction and they could reach me through the metal links. Blood hammers through my body, panic clouding my vision, making my hands shake and pound with the rhythm of my heart."

The Conservative Political Action Conference at which all the major Republican presidential contenders will speak, as well and prominent Republican members of Congress is co-sponsored by several organizations including “Youth for Western Civilization” whose founder, Marcus Epstein, was arrested and pled guilty to a hate crime after karate chopping a black woman on a street while calling her a “nigger,” and who is reputed to have strong ties to European Neo-Fascist organizations (according to People for the American Way).
She disappeared from the room for a moment and I instantly stood and went over to a water fountain, five feet from where I sat, and got myself a drink. I knew not to take much but what I did drink satisfied me. Neither Bill nor I said a word about my drinking when the nurse returned. She didn't finish the intake paperwork. She had asked me how far apart the pains were. Telling her there was no "apart" to them, that they were constantly hitting very hard, she had rushed out, again without a word. Hurrying back into the room with a wheelchair, she helped me into it and rushed down a hall, wheeling me to the labor room; then others took over and put me into a bed. In a couple minutes another nurse also came in and checked to see how far I had dilated and left but immediately returned because of my screams. Whoops, she saw the crowning of your head and rushed to get help to take me to delivery. They no more than got me on the gurney then !Pop! there you were. And here you are 47 years and some minutes later passing your time on another September morning, sound asleep, I imagine, for it is Sunday, a day off work for you.

It has a kind of Tuscan vibe that I really wasn't looking for, but I can live with that. I staged my photos on my daughter's desk which is (still) temporarily sitting in the foyer, and I couldn't resist including it in the pics a little bit. I am not done with it yet, but it's such a pretty piece of furniture. I need to finish it and give it to her before I decide she can't have it.
One thing I absolutely HAVE to mention: the packaging is so cute! It comes with its own little brown cushion, in a pink box, in a black box.

Well...it didn't happen. We walked for about three miles, for over an hour, and found nothing but coffee shop after coffee shop -- with only java and muffins -- and a few Chinese places, but Cathy didn't want stir fry bean curd, and I didn't want muffins. We did see a lot of neat scenes, some weird stuff in the Tenderloin, and got some exercise, but wound up settling for a coffee shop near the hotel and an oatmeal for her and a "Southwestern egg & cheese sammich" for me. Feh.

The band first appeared on the show on September 18, 1982 performing "Save it for Later" and "Sugar and Stress", from Special Beat Service. Amazingly, they shared billing that day with Australia`s Men At Work. The band were at the height of their game during this time and from what I remember, the American!Bandstand performances were equally impressive. I immediately purchased "Special Beat Service" soon afterwards.
I’ve been using the first person pronoun, ‘I’, up until now purely for convenience. I used to have a fair decent handle on who I was but after reading this book I am far from certain. I always thought that ‘I’ consisted primarily of the conscious part of me: I like Star Trek, I like chocolate, I like to write. Apparently it’s not that simple. Okay, so am I the sum of my experiences then? Yes and no. Scientists have argued for years over the whole nature vs. nurture view of human development and the view that Eagleman takes is that both are contributory factors (even though we choose neither one) but it is primarily who we are (our chemistry) that affects how we react to whatever life throws at us.

Weekly Challenge #37: Technique Challenge!The Challenge: All week long the Cricut Circle Design Team has been showing you new and different techniques to use with your Cricut Cuts (check back tomorrow, there is still one more!). . . now it’s your turn! Create a project of your choice (Scrapbook page, mini album, card, home decor . . . it’s up to you!) including one of the techniques we have showcased this week. Let me recap for you! Monday, Kristen used letter stickers to create her own textured patterned paper of sorts to cut shapes from. Tuesday, Suzanne cut her shapes from vellum and used her Cuttlebug machine to emboss them. On Thursday, Jennifer used beads and glitter to dress up her Cricut cuts to create a Keepsake Photo Thank You card. Today, Deanna shows you a crayon resist technique with spray mists. Finally, tomorrow Michele Kovack will be back to show you how to add shading and dimension to your Cricut cuts using Copic markers! Choose one of these techniques and then apply it to your own project! We can’t wait to see what you do!
Tabitha eventually settles in with a motley assortment of British students, including a vivacious extrovert who involves her in schemes to finagle free drinks, a morose snooker aficionado who indoctrinates her into his favorite pastime, and an enigmatic aristocrat who invites her into a secret society that convenes on nights of the full moon.
If my professor were to ask me today about the roles of nature versus nurture and the role of parents in child development, I would definitely posit that nurture plays a greater role then nature in determining success. I believe it's not my DNA that is hopefully creating a great kid, it's my daily interactions with her that make the bigger difference.

Today winning an election is not any more based on gaining the trust and confidence of the voter for BN. Instead, it is one of “timing” which translates to cunningness really does it not?

Apart from the invasive facility to set up FB pages in other people’s names and reveal sensitive information about them, this exposes a laxity in Facebook’s access protocols which takes one breath away. Apparently an unconnected individual can take control of a community page and alter or delete information in it, without any evaluation or consent by either the original owner or Facebook.
It feels like someone is stabbing a knife in my ear drum and waggling it about a bit. It's felt like that for three days. It has given me toothache in a way that I don't really understand. It has left me deaf in my right ear and confused my sense of balance. But the cruelest trick is that the pain is ten times worse if I lie down. Which is making sleep tricky.

Bored? Stuck inside on a rainy day? On the computer instead of folding clothes? try this: Find a recipe, go paste it in to Babelfish translator. Choose a language to translate it into, I prefer one with a completely different alphabet like Russian or Chinese. Translate it, then translate it back into English. If you’re really bored, translate it several times before putting it back into English. It’s like that party game “telephone”, only by yourself.

The next stop for the TARDIS trio was to Scotland 1746, just after the Battle of Culloden where the Doctor befriended a group of Highland Jacobites.

The above video feature is Simon Potter from Fast-print.net giving one of the seminars on Tuesday 17th of April. Most of the seminars followed the same pattern over the three days with Potter showcasing Fast-print.net with a later cover design session in the afternoon. I'm uncomfortable with a number of perceptions about self-publishing presented here by Potter and Fast-print. Firstly, Fast-print is one of a number of digital printers operating in the UK - and there are many in the USA and other countries - presenting what they do as a 'complete solution' for authors looking to self-publish a book

Next time you go back to the supermarket, nothing has changed, so you go for the hamper deal again, and this continues for a few weeks. But then the supermarket starts raising the price of the hamper deal. It’s still a lot cheaper than buying the items individually — not surprisingly as the individual prices are ridiculous — but it is clear that prices are going up faster than inflation (or even than food prices in general).
Brooklynn has turned into such a sweet girl. I can honestly admit that I've been overly emotional this pregnancy. I don't usually care much about birthdays, but when we were all going to bed and david still wasn't home I got a little upset. I might have even cried a little (or a lot). Sweet Brooklynn climbed into bed with me and wrapped her tiny arms around my neck. She started saying "It's ok Mommy, Brooklynn's here! I've got you, don't cry Mommy...don't be sad!". Then I might have bawled like a baby from those sweet words.

My hat is off to those who endure the ups and downs with the general public. I have never had to SMILE so much in my life and you all KNOW how I love to smile. Smiling here...truly! I wish my former co-workers and boss all the best and thank them tremendously for the wonderful experience I had when I was working at Costco there. I will cherish every moment I had there NOT a one goes without my thanks.
Human nature being what it is – customarily dilatory – there was a flurry of “pro” and “con” comments just after the original announcement, and then relative quiet; now, as the “dreaded” day draws near, the prospective policy change has been mentioned a couple of times in conversation, and I’ve started thinking about it again.
So there you have it. I think I may be a slightly opinionated person (and a little sarcastic too). Oh well. Thanks for listening to me vent today, and if you have any of your own pet peeves that you'd like to share or would like to call me out on mine, please leave me a comment. Debating is not one of my pet peeves, but is a treasured pasttime. Have a great day everybody!

Memory and intelligence, it seems, go hand in hand. So, take notice. Be mindful and attentive. Even our ability to find humor depends on memory.

I love the process as when I worked on coming up with my life statement last year, even though there was a process I worked through, it took a long time as there wasn't any real impetus to completing it other than that we'd been asked to do it. Having a task to complete by a specific date is so much better as it means you commit to doing something, even if only with yourself, and can focus on what you need to do.

I’m all in agreement here and I’ve experienced the same but I’m thinking more after the fact, after you’ve read the book. Is that you done your bit? Until recently I would have said it was; I’d paid my money and, to be totally honest, if I’d chosen to use the book as a doorstop no one could argue with me; in fact I have half a dozen poetry books underneath my second laptop as I write this keeping it level, some of which I have not read and likely never will. I wonder if any of the authors were I to list them (which I have no intention of doing) would be willing to send me their royalty payment so I could package the book up and post it back to them? Not me. If you want to buy my books to use as doorstops feel free.

At this point, he got seriously involved in my quest. He said I couldn't help being a natural-born Dropper of Things, but he agreed that I needed to upgrade. The search began for a Canon EOS SLR . I was given a used Canon 50D. It was cheap because it’s wonky (and I damaged it even more by trying to clean it), but I love it dearly. Then, Dr. Big bought a Canon T1i as the “family” camera. It’s much easier to carry around than the 50D, and it has many of the 50D’s options, such as “Creative Mode” and automatic. You can tinker, but to a point.

BOSTON — A senior at a Roman Catholic college in Massachusetts who has written letters of support to a Norwegian mass murder suspect will not be on campus “for the foreseeable future,” according to school officials.
Kinda pressed for time this AM, so a quickie introduction to this one.. It was originally another one of my “songs” but I came across it yesterday and thought “why not post it as a poem.” So here it is..There is a lot of truth in the humor here, and I hope you all will like it.

Bangladesh which has a population of approx 142 million depends mainly on India to import soybean meal needed to produce feed for poultry. They are rolling out this year, their third seed crushing plant which will reduce dependence on imported meal. This extension will meet 44% of the demand for oilcake of the country and 7.82% of the demand for soybean oil. Just as well they planned to do this because:-
“He hasn’t written any books. He hasn’t been on the radio. He hasn’t appeared on any TV talk shows. He hasn’t been in any movies. I haven’t seen his face on the cover of People Magazine or the Washington Post. How can you tell me, he is the Messiah, Philip?”

How to shake them from their lethargy? Fear again. Tell them, as Obama repeatedly does, that Paul Ryan’s budget would cut Pell Grants by $1,000 each, if his domestic cuts were evenly distributed. (They are not evenly distributed, making the charge a fabrication. But a great applause line.)
While Sean, 15, adapted to the scene during his semester long stint, and felt he "really fit in well," and plans to continue school, Devon, 14, did not.
Oh, and there’s one other detail that makes this case stand out. Trayvon Martin was black. That shouldn’t matter, though, right?
In South Africa, fear is big business. And even though the crime rate is declining, the fear rate is rising -- which makes for a lucrative business opportunity for the security industry.
So Henri-Pierre knew what Time must look like: black grains of earth, straining like something hungry against the bottle glass.
Three months it's been - count them, three months since I last displayed my talent for multitasking. Check out my ability to dry my hair, whilst eating breakfast and simultaneously checking my e-mails. It is a gift.

But wait! There’s more! In the original Italian, many of the jokes depend on the impenetrable regional dialects that define the characters, as when Pantalone’s crotchety Venetian collides with Arlecchino’s rustic burr from Bergamo while the lovers coo in elegant Tuscan. And then there’s the foreigner Capitano who butchers his Italian, often to uproariously obscene effect. Rather than trying to adapt American dialects – say Pantalone with a Southern drawl or a Dottore from Harvard Square – it is more effective to have the servant spout contractions and vulgarities, the elders gabble in persnickety patter, and the lovers proclaim passion in heartbreaking lyrical verse.
I will be taking on my biggest Adventure yet, Climbing Kilimanjaro for Alzheimer’s Australia NSW! I will Climb Kilimanjaro in honour of my Grandpa who passed away from Alzheimer’s in 2008. I was in Africa when I found out and I said at the time I would one day do this for him, in his memory! We are raising money for Alzheimer’s Australia NSW to raise awareness and the necessary funds for prevention of the disease that affects so many. Dementia is the third leading cause of death in Australia, after heart disease and stroke. We must prevent and find a cure as it’s not a normal part of aging, and does affect 100,000’s of Australians.
Chamblee is the best big sister (aside from my own, of course). She is in a phase where she wants to help. And I mean, help with ev.ery.thing. It's very sweet and it's often funny. I love to hear her talking in the next room, "I helping mama". Only to find her unloading the trash can- just so she can put all the trash back in. Or to hear a giant squeal coming from the bouncy seat that Jake is sleeping in- and finding that she has yanked out his pacifier... just so she can give it back to him. "I helping mama." She has the sweetest heart. She understands the concept of sharing already, kind of, and will steal a toy right out of your hand- just so she can give it right back and share it with you. I love that girl. And she loves her brother.
First up: a sisig taco (picture on the left), a blend of ground meat in sour marinade (well, according to Wikipedia anyway). This was available from the Filipino food truck, Senor Sisig. I went with beef sisig with some spice. The lettuce was finally shredded which helped hold the taco together better. I liked the bit of lime squeezed on top of the taco, and the sauce definitely was a good way to counter the spiciness of the taco. Well done!

Box office sales are the mark of popularity. They measure how many have flocked to the theatres and are willing to pay to see a movie. Low ticket sales of course is related to how widely released the movie is, but it also gauges popular taste. There’s the rub, would the Academy members vote for a movie that has been seen by just a fraction of the viewing public? Would they judge a movie only on its artistic and technical merits rather than the sales it generates?
No clue when we’re finally gonna be done. The daily trips to Home Depot (and one trip to the Duron store) are getting old. We’ve gone through 3 dropcloths – thin plastic (Avoid), thick plastic (good but sticky and unruly), and paper (ruly, but doesn’t protect floor from liquids). Today we’re gonna put plastic on the bottom and paper on the top, instead of the other way around. It will work better I think.
Last night I watched an episode of Torchwood that was highly disturbing. “Sleeper,” it was called, and it was about a sleeper agent alien.
Years ago, I was chased by wasps whilst I was trying to enjoy an ice lolly in the park with Father of the Year and Holly, who was about 2 at the time. I tried to bat at them but they took no notice, so I tried to move out of their way but they kept following me, persistent little buggers.

One thing The Know-It-All does do quite well is convey the breadth of the world’s available knowledge, something I actually think Wikipedia minimizes by virtue of being so accessible. After all, there’s a difference between looking something up when you need to know it, and setting out to learn everything there is to know.
Take this hand, consciously. That’s practicing love. Our way is simple, in truth. Our yearnings are our destination, our path and our living home every day. We’re led into the light by our own existence.

Next, grill a steak. Or in our case yesterday because the sky looked threatening, I cooked it in an iron skillet. I let the steak come to room temperature, rubbed in olive oil and fresh cracked pepper on both sides and then seared it for two minutes on each side in a preheated HOT iron skillet. After the second side, I put it in a preheated 450 degree oven for about 4-5 minutes. I took it out of the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes, then thinly sliced it.

The new album from North Carolina band Horseback is a deeply provocative and evocative creation, a release that explores and expands into the senses like a dawning idea or emotion. From an initial spark it grows into a consuming and emotive experience which leaves a distinct and pleasurable aftermath to contemplate. Half Blood melds numerous essences of diverse metal styles into a seamless and provoking journey which challenges, mesmerises, and leaves a discerning rapture in its wake.
Last week I resigned from the car auction. It was not an easy choice as I have worked with my boss for 17 years. However, the ankle is not healing as quickly as I would have liked, so I took the plunge, sold my shares in the business and am concentrating on getting well, and doing a few personal things. I am still auctioning houses on the weekends and will have a chat to a few firms in a month or two, looking to work as a contract valuer and /or auctioneer.
This - or these; I bought two of them - was, or were, my Christmas gift to myself this week.
You can see the arena I built for these games. The other gladiators are just “scenery”. It makes the arena look crowded and adds to the visual spectacle (and wargaming should always look beautiful)

Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) – If I may begin this movie on a mostly-irrelevant note (and it’s my damn blog, I see no reason I can’t) I’d like to point out that everyone’s been talking about 3D like it’s a fad or a passing thing. This movie was in 3D 58 years ago. Amusingly in the DVD special features (produced maybe around 2000-2002) they talk about how young people these days have no idea what a big deal 3D was. I smirked, figuring today’s youth might have an idea or two about that. Anyway I watched this movie on old-fashioned two-dimensional Digital Versatile Disc, so that’s really the last I’m going to talk about 3D. The second film on my marathon of Universal Monster movies is Creature from the Black Lagoon (as you might have assumed). Made in 1954, it was somewhat removed from the 1930s heyday of Frankenstein and Dracula. Indeed, everyone’s man-fish was the last of classic Universal Monsters. An elegant swan song or a brand on the decline?
In truth, I was taking the shortcut route to wrecking my perfectly preserved Northern skin. Until this point I was a cured Ham, a frozen turkey. I was showing Nature two ill-directed fingers; for she had done everything in her power to avoid such subjection to the rays of warmer climes.

Grate the other onion into a bowl (use the medium holes of a box grater). Add the ground beef, and a pinch of kosher salt and black pepper. Use your hands to combine the mixture, then form it into small meatballs the size of walnuts. Gently add the meatballs to the soup, and simmer for 10 minutes, turning the meatballs as you stir from time to time.
In any case, if the EDL does or did break the law, then the police can deal with it. Again, the UAF/SWP alliance is not a law-making or democratic body. So why should we even care what it thinks about the EDL?
Today I flew.
Then I did a bit of a Lorenzo's Oil paperclip thing and realised Dreadskulls and wounds are actually the same thing... it just needed a Skulldred twist to get to the dark bloody truth of deadly resource management.
VERDICT: While it took a bit of prep work, as opposed to opening a packet of onion soup mix, the results were much better. Chips with mayo and sour cream = total guilty pleasure. Very good! However, there are a few notes on what I would do differently, next time. First, the onions should be diced. At first, it was fun to have a clump of onion with each bite. At the bottom of the bowl, there were too many onions that clumped together. I didn't like how that looked. Secondly, the Susie-Q seasoning should have been reduced by about half. I love this seasoning mix for our Santa Maria Style Tri-Tip. I felt it was a little too salty, though my husband didn't. I wasn't compensating for the fact that the chips are already salty, so keep that in mind while seasoning the mayonnaise and sour cream. I think a pinch of cayenne or paprika would be a nice touch, too.
The wealthier and more privileged social groups have been mostly insulated from the worst of these phenomena through residential isolation in well-protected neighborhoods, and by their access to private schooling for their children. The brunt of immigrant lawlessness has been borne by the lower and lower-middle classes, who are subjected to harassment and violence on an almost daily basis.
This is a Phase 2 South Beach recipe that I made last night. It has great flavor and is super simple to prepare. The zing of the mustard with the slight crunch of the browned bread crumbs was really nice.

Ladies and gentleman I’d like to introduce you to the best comedy from this TV season. Don’t get me wrong there are a bunch of great comedies on air at the moment but Community shines out above the rest. In my original review of the series I threw around the word ‘potential’. While the pilot didn’t wow me too much, the show felt like it could go places. On this occasion I’d like to thank myself for being right, unlike that time when I said I liked Vampire Diaries more than Community. If Me From Now could go back and slap Me From October in the face, I would, because as it stands there is no show on television I like more than Community.
And I've been in my own prison of sorts - paralyzed by dread and anxiety as I awaited the verdict at every convoluted step. I think that the French have a certain affinity towards torture-through-bureaucracy, as if all my waiting and document gathering and xerox copying and line standing and number taking and stamp buying and phone calling (to phones that are never answered) builds character. If that's the case, then I could start a shop and make a fortune selling all my extra character. I might as well sell it, since I've become a twitching, drooling mess and couldn't use all that character if I tried.
When Laurelwood opened its new restaurant in NW Portland, I convinced many of my fellow “actletes” at ComedySportz to move our après-comedy gatherings from the mediocre and sometimes surly service at McMenamin’s Tavern. In short, over the years I’ve been an enthusiastic supporter.
Notus, Idaho – April 16, 1999: 15-year-old Shawn Cooper fired two shotgun rounds in his school, narrowly missing students. He was taking a prescribed SSRI antidepressant and Ritalin.
She always told me that we weren't allowed to grow up but now that I have you, I know what she meant. There are days that I just want to freeze time so that I can protect you forever. Like this morning, when you fell asleep on my chest, I wanted to stay in that moment forever, just listening to you snore and breathing you in. But just as fast as I wish you would stay 2 months old forever, I can't wait to see you grow up.

If you allow Bersih 2.0 to go on peacefully, hey, you might even get some good PR from the public. But your own Umno warlords will castrate you for being a “dayus”. So I guess you and your cousin Hishammudin will get evil on the Bersih 2.0 participants, cos you gotta save face.

But they have not left their illustrated roots behind. Helen was showing two debut picture books at the Fair - Oh dear, Geoffrey! by Gemma O'Neill, about a giraffe and Emma Bennet's Sidney, Stella and the Moon, about best friends. Lovely books but what makes them special is that the artists were two who just turned up at the Templar stand a year ago with their portfolios! It's good to know such magic can still happen.

Service was quick and friendly, I was in and out in about 15 minutes for the loss of £8.50 including a soft drink and a tip. Would I return?

While paint jobs and lawn care are among the first factors that can influence a home’s appearance, a driveway can make a tremendous impact on it too. If it is spotted with oil spills and the pavement is cracked, your driveway can detract from the looks of your home and landscaping, no matter how much you have put in.
The next batch was not nearly as lucky. The way we do this is drive the ranch until we spot swine. We then hop out and stalk within range. Sometimes it’s fifty yards, sometimes 300. Everyone picks a hog and cleans up, hopefully. It is exciting stuff experiencing five rifles bark at once. It’s frenzied. Hog squealing, folks yelling, brass being shucked out just as fast as the action works. It’s dessert after a long winter and spring of meticulous deer and turkey hunting.
I cannot, for the life of me, find a 'before' picture of this dresser. Sigh.
Growing up, I was never the "skinny girl." I was always athletic to a degree, and liked being active, but I could see that I was just a little bigger than those around me. My body image wasn't great, and I compared myself to my friends all the time. In college, there was more of the same. Going to a strict Christian college for the first two years meant I didn't gain the Freshman 15, and I stayed active throughout. A transfer, another school, and more of the same.
