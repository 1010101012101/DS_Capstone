When people make a decision to dramatically change their course in life, it is seen as both admirable and inferior. Perhaps it is admirable because it involves making oneself ‘inferior’—materially depriving oneself and taking oneself out of a linear career path. Dreams are not always enough when healthy salaries and CBD offices are on offer. Doing what you are passionate about can mean less nice clothes and less restaurant dinners. And being held in lesser esteem by people with ‘real’ jobs and mortgages.

Now I would love to launch into a whole romantic story about our first dance song which has since become ‘our song.’ But I can’t. The simple fact is, about two weeks before the wedding we could not decide on a song for our first dance. We had never really had a ‘song’ there were a few that we both liked but nothing we could actually agree on.

Bennett: 2011 is gonna be our first year making a big push with the band and trying to put us on the map and try to get our music to as many people as possible through any means necessary. Since finishing the last record I have already started to work on songs for the next album. My guess would be to release an EP after this album. So we may or may not see that come together this summer. It is all kind of a big waiting game right now to see how people are going to react to the new tunes.

Thanks for letting me see The List by Joe Konrath. While it's certainly not a plot I've seen before--at least the cloning part--it seems very familiar all the same, plus the humor in the storytelling seems a little forced and sitcom-ish, and finally exhausted my interest. So it has to be a pass for me. Despite my reservations about The List, I suspect the originality of the concept will prove a lure to someone, and I wish you all the best with it. - Simon & Schuster

Jolie wasn’t like the other students she went to school with. She was more practical and responsible. She was twenty years-old but she lived more like a thirty-five-year-old woman. She went to class on time and paid attention. She was an excellent student, but her grades in high school had only been good enough to earn her a partial scholarship. Her assignments were done on time and often days before they were actually due. The other students did not like her because she always set the curve in class for tests. Jolie did not let that bother her, because unlike most of them she was there to learn—not to make friends. Her goal was to become a high school biology teacher. Then she could teach at her old high school and move in with her grandmother. She would have enough money for the two of them to live off of and she could repay the old lady back for raising her when her parents died. Maman Nettie and Papa George didn’t bat an eyelash when she needed a place to live. They took her in without question or complaint. She hoped she was a strong enough person to do the same for her grandmother in her old age.

O’Connor also followed the old Scriptshadow staple of making your bad guy REALLY BAD. The badder he is, the more we’ll want to see our hero take him down. Hagan shoots a fucking father and son without blinking. That’s bad. But note how he did it. Anybody can have the bad guy shoot someone to make the audience hate him. That’s a cliché choice and probably won’t resonate. So O’Connor has his bad guy shoot the man’s son first - right in front of him! That hits us way harder (a father watches his son get shot right in front of him!!).

I don't even know how many snow men I have.
He didn’t say another word. I sprang up and thrust the frame so violently into his jaw that it cracked, uncovering the jagged edge of cheap glass beneath it.

He fell forward on top of me, dead. Pinned by the weight of his lifeless body, I was unable to move.

She did not go on to clarify what she meant by this comment, but it seems reasonable to conclude that she was implying that some of the soldiers would and do feel ashamed of their condition. If so, I wish she could have expanded on this by saying that there is no need for these people to feel ashamed; mental health challenges are not a sign of weakness and that contrary to this, the experience of adversity is a gifted opportunity to become stronger and more resilient in the long-term, once these challenges have been overcome with the appropriate support.

It was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead, when he slipped out of the warm parlour into the open air. The country lay bare and entirely leafless around him, and the thought that he had never seen so far and so intimately into the insides of the things as on that winter day when Nature was dep in her annual slumber and seemed to have kicked the clothes off. Copses, dells, quarries and all hidden places, which had been mysterious mines for exploration in leafy summer, now exposed themselves and their secrets pathetically, and seemed to ask him to overlook their shabby poverty for a while, til they could riot in rich masquearade as before, and trick and entice him with the old deceptions. It was pitiful in a way, and yet cheering- even exhilarating. He was glad that he liked the country undecorated, hard, and stripped of its finery. He had got down to the bare bones of it, and they were fine and strong and simple. He did not want the warm clover and the play of seeding grasses; the screens of quickset, the billowy drapery of beech and elm seemed best away; and with great cheerfulness of spirit he pushed on towards the Wild Wood, which law before him low and threatening, like a black reef in some still southern sea.

So over Christmas break I've been just basically chilling at home, watching a lot of Grey's Anatomy (hereafter called GA - its much easier that way). I just finished Season 6 on DVD and have gotten about halfway through Season 7 (I've been tivo-ing it). WOWWWW... the Season 6 finale was SO shocking!!! I cried through the whole 2nd half practically. OK Spoiler alert... if you have not watched the Season 6 closer then DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER... you WILL be sorry. Unless you don't watch GA and thence don't care whether it gets spoiled.

It can be difficult to be a fan of college hoops — and I really enjoy college hoops — when your school is always terrible in basketball. Not just occasionally terrible, mind you, not just those inevitable slumps of a year or two or even a bad decade, but always. It’s like there’s a really cool party going on, and the party never really stops, but it doesn’t matter that the party lasts forever, because you still don’t have a ticket and you may never get one, and what really irks you is that practically every other person in the free world has been to the party, even some out-and-out losers who don’t even realize how great the party really is, and you are still left out in the cold.

My dear brothers and sisters in Christ, please know that God always listens to your prayers, and be aware that He speaks in so many different ways in response to these prayers. Be it through the advice of holy individuals in Scriptures like Christ or Paul, even the suggestions from your mother or peers that align with that of the Bible, or through nature if that is God’s plans to further reveal himself to you. Please do remember this as you continue to communicate to God in this 2-way dialogue. But know that God will respond to you with an answer that you may like or may not; nevertheless, this is God’s will and prepared path for us, and we must recognize that everything he has, is, or will allow in our lives are for our own benefit in our unique growth path toward Him, with our own unique sets of events and blessings. My loving brothers and sisters, do not waste your time attempting to “make things happen” and benefit ourselves by merely praying “in faith” because God knows what is truly in your heart.

Jodi Kim, an Associate Professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of California Riverside, is the author of the book Ends of Empire: Asian American Critique and the Cold War, which was published by University of Minnesota Press in 2010. In her book she examines Asian American cultural production (such as novels and films) that “shift, reframe, and critically extend dominant interpretations of the Cold War by staging the Cold War as a geopolitical, cultural, and epistemological project of gendered racial formation and imperialism undergirding U.S. global hegemony, and by making visible the centrality of Asia to that project.” Having earned her PhD at the University of California Berkeley in 2004, Professor Jodi Kim is interested in teaching Asian American and Asian Diasporic Literature, Film, and Visual Art, Gender and Sexuality in Asian American Studies, Cultural Studies, and Critical Theory.

I do understand of not moving holidays, it basically and technically follows the calendar and makes us celebrate remarkable dates on the actual date. But it’s really more satisfying to have them moved. Like today could have been moved yesterday for us to enjoy a three-day vacation (not to mention it’s summer). Aside from that perks, it also makes us more productive. It changes the thought of ‘I cannot accomplish such things because I only have a two-day vacation and I need to catch up with some sleep’ to ‘Great! I have a three day vacation, I can do more!’

So where does the Twelve days of Christmas come in? Well, on Christmas morning, the kids would have all these gifts. Wrapping, ribbon, boxes...a mess. Just like I did when I was a kid. And like my mom, I would gather up the wrapping & stack the gifts under the tree. And just like me when I was young, my kids picked a couple toys to play with all day on Christmas. The rest, forgotten under the tree. .....For days. About a week after Christmas, I would gather up the gifts and put them away in their room. When cleaning their room months later, I would notice some of the gifts still weren't used. And I remembered back, the same thing as a child. Gifts went forgotten, and never used.

This time, citizens raised questions about recycling and building debris at the solid waste transfer station, support for the shellfish commission, and brush-clearing on the roads. A splinter group decided the town's long-time animal control officer needed a substantial raise to help with truck maintenance. The voters gave him another $100 a month even though he'd only asked for $15 or $20 more. He said he "doesn't do the job as good anymore" because he no longer cleans up roadkill. (The crows handle that nicely.) He does, however, keep stray dogs at his own house as much as he can. He's been looking for an apprentice, but "nobody loves animals like I do."

Existing methods of analysing film style make a priori assumptions about the functions of style and then provide examples to support this assertion. This runs the risk of begging the question and circulus in probando, in which the researcher’s original assumption is used as a basis for selecting the pertinent relations of film style which are then used to justify the basis for making assumptions about the functions of film style. We would like to avoid such logically flawed reasoning whilst also minimising the risk that we will miss pertinent relations that did not initially occur to us. By adopting a data-driven approach we can derive the functions of film style by studying the elements themselves without the need to make any such a priori assumptions. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) allows us to do this by forcing us to attend to the data on its own terms.

Would have met this way.
The Way We’re Working Isn’t Working by Tony Schwartz ($28.00, Free Press) takes a look at today’s workplace and finds it about as enervating as a salt mine. He points out that human beings aren’t designed to operate like computers—at high speeds, continuously, running multiple tasks at the same time, but as often as not that’s the kind of demand being put on today’s workers. The result is distracted, exhausted, and often demoralized workers in tough economic times. Written with Jean Gomes and Catherine McCarthy, PhD, the book offers a way for individuals to manage their energy more skillfully. It will help those in management positions by pointing out ways to ensure their co-worker’s energy levels are taken into account these days, creating organizational policies and practices that fuel rather than deplete human energy. It refutes the myths that people can get by with little sleep or that fear is a motivational device. It lays waste to the notion that multi-tasking is a good idea. As if the workplace wasn’t stressful enough, the process by which one selects a career path can also be a challenge. Work to Your Strengths by Chuck Martin, Richard Guare, PhD, and Peg Dawson, EdD, ($21.95, Amacom) puts forth a program on how best to identify one’s best skills and channel them into jobs that will prove satisfying over the long run. The authors say your brain is hardwired to function in certain ways and you have to match that to jobs where you will find the most success and satisfaction. It identifies specific executive skills that will enhance the work experience. This is not light reading, but it can ignite the kind of insight that you can use to make good choices.
Students should firstly understand the good intentions of the teacher viz. to help them. They should not let ego get in the way. Secondly they should analyze what is being taught. Honesty is the ultimate litmus test for any method – does the defense withstand an honest attack. If something cannot be tested right away, accept what the teacher says and observe events as they unfold over time to see if the teaching bears the test of time.
I understand that the distributors see supermarket sales as the single greatest threat to their livelihood, and this looks like the wedge to open that up. I think that instead of spending their time and money fighting against something that is simply, clearly legal under the Code as it stands, they should be putting their efforts into changing the laws that govern how all booze is sold in PA. Get rid of the case law and allow six-pack and single sales for distributors ASAP. Get rid of the State Store system and let distributors sell wine and spirits. Get normal.

After hashing out details and throwing ideas back and forth and explaining our stories and characters and concepts to each other, we are both completely pumped to go and work on our stories. Also, it’s a great way to grow and improve, as they may see things you don’t, or have suggestions you may never have thought of. It’s one of my favorite means of inspiration.

There is no doubt that each film will amaze and each one will add to the legacy of a genre that just won’t stop growing. What film of 2012 will be the best superhero film of the year? I don’t know but my money is on the Bat.
So hard, in fact, that me and the old man are going to do it all again, in a new brewery in the near future. We’ll take the lessons of the past, and the contacts we’ve made with suppliers, and most of all the support and friendship of the wonderful community of microbrewers. But we won’t be taking the kit we have fitted and welded and hammered and banged and humoured into shape, and we won’t be taking a whole host of things left at the Barn one evening in the sincere belief that we would be back to rescue them.
So, here is a huge rallying cry: GET YOUR DAM ON!
I’m writing this because I just had the best 2 weeks, and now last night I dipped down again. For 2 weeks, I think I experienced “normal”. I slept at night, I awoke rested, I could think ahead to start laundry before a meeting, I clocked more consecutive work hours than I have in years, I kept my patience with kids, I joked and played games with kids, I kept my temper in check. This was not a mania, as I did not do impulsive things, I was not out of control, I did not stay up all night. I was peaceful and happy and working towards my goals. I started the spring cleaning that never got finished 5 years ago, and never got started the past few years.
Those days of telling ghost stories at sleepovers are pretty far behind me, but I've found that a great horror novel is basically a high-concept version of a creepy campfire story - just with more complex characters and plot points. So how can writers capture that same feeling of dread?
Just to note: the formula and application was great on all the polishes. And the finish on Adina’s holo polish is so perfect! I never feel the need to put top coat on, it dries fast and doesn’t feel like it’ll chip easily.

Now Björk (who doesn't use her last name, Gutmundsdottir) has gone solo, as some devotees always fell she should. In recent interviews, the 27-year-old singer has professed that she never much cared for the alternative-rock qualities of the Sugarcubes' music. With Debut (Elektra, 9 61468-2; CD and cassette), she set out to combine her love of jazz with her ardor for rave music. To this end, she hooked up with Nellee Hooper of Soul II Soul, who produced most of the album and co-wrote five of the 11 songs. Mr. Hooper's rhythmic expertise provides the kind of groovy settings Björk's voice has always deserved. The collaboration has proved effective; the album is rapidly climbing Billboard's pop chart.

All these elements are certainly true of gay pioneers because, quite understandably, there are few published diaries or first-hand accounts of them. Not only was it an extremely dangerous thing to do, but most GLBT men and women were not ‘out’ to their families or friends. Moreover, they were even loathe to reveal a lifetime of secrets after death--often directing that their personal papers be destroyed by a trusted friend.
Basically what they’re saying is “wouldn’t it be great if game genres weren’t filed on the shelf by their mechanics, but instead were defined by the underlying reasons why a person would seek out to play the game. The “Why play?” discussion we sometimes have.

Still, our stuff is stuck in a container in South Africa, the Mexican government refuses to officially acknowledge that they'd like for us to stay longer, leaving us to live in a vacation rental apartment, out of our suitcases, without a car, without a local bank account (leaving my Danish Visa-card soon closed and screaming for mercy), without a cellular subscription, and without anywhere to properly call home. Although we already are, referring to Mexico City as home, like we never left in the first place.
It was a quick trip this weekend. We went to Houston for Grace's dance recital. Friday to Sunday. We enjoyed it, but are glad to be home. This trip brought home to me just how much I'm missing by not being able to miss too many Sundays at PBC. I've got some major thinking to do!!! We saw the video of their piano recitals and some great video of their church play.
And in the public domain it makes sense to look at Art in this way. As an industry, the Arts stand or fall on how well they reach an audience. Its not simply that art sitting unsold on shelves isn’t good, its just that it doesn’t say the right things to its viewers for it to earn its keep. It has to communicate before it can be either liked or disliked. And if quality and popularity are two separate trends, even the best of quality will go unnoticed if it is inaccessible. (I just read where an Opera company is now selling tickets at $5/month because 80% of its revenues are from philanthropy and it makes almost more sense to give tickets away than to sell them to only an elite crowd that can afford high prices. Fascinating!)

The Story of Holly & Ivy by Rumer Godden-- Ivy, who lives in an orphanage, wants a home for Christmas more than anything else. Ivy makes a wish. Holly is a doll left all alone in a toyshop window on Christmas Eve. More than anything, she wants a child's hands to bring her to life and play with her. Holly makes a wish. A childless couple have a beautiful Christmas tree and holiday feast, but long for a child to share it with also make a wish. This is a touching tale about the miracles that can sometimes happen around Christmas time.
Recently I found out that one of my best friends who happens to be my sister in law is.....EXPECTING! Yes, she is PREGNANT and we couldn't be more happier for her. She is due Early Jan. 2012 and I just know she will make a great mother and I am mostly excited to meet this Little Baby along with being by her side through this journey. Her and I have become so close over the last few years and knowing that she is getting to experience this wonderful gift that GOD has created and she will get to feel a LOVE that she has never felt before just makes my heart happy!! We already call this baby, Sweet Pea and I am saying it's going to be a BOY! I just have that feeling and Momma J has that feeling too. Momma J is what I will refer to when I speak of my SIL. Congrats to her and our family. Babies are such a blessing and I can't wait to have another one in our lives. Momma J- I love you and I am so proud of you!!

The first edition begins with the arrival of movie starlet Rosemary on the Riviera where Dick and Nicole Diver preside from their expensive villa over a seasonable fashionable community of expatriate pleasure-seeking Americans. The overall viewpoint is that of Rosemary who becomes infatuated with the Divers, falling immediately in love with Dick - and, encouraged by her mother, setting out to seduce him - and fascinated by Nicole's beauty and a mystery that surrounds her. At a party held by the Divers, another guest, Mrs McKiscoe, sees Nicole in some unspecified compromising situation, compromising enough for Mrs McKiscoe's lack of discretion to occasion a duel. Later, when Rosemary accompanies the Divers to Paris - her affair with Dick gathering apace - the mystery of what Mrs McKiscoe saw is uncovered for her. After this, Rosemary drops from the story and the narrative explains the background to the mystery by flashing back to Dick's early years in Zurich as a brilliant young up-and-coming psychiatrist and his first meeting with psychiatric patient Nicole. The events in their lives up to their present-day reign on the Riviera are then filled in, and having brought their story back up to date, the novel follows Dick's subsequent slow disintegration.

We also had Cub Scout. Sigh. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Cub Scouts. But, it's not the most fun to do when your kids don't have leaders. No 11 year old scout leader. No Bears leader.

Bloggers and the reporters and editors of various newspapers have only given us the level of comprehension they have -- clearly not adequate here -- and failed to make the effort to delve into technical stuff in depth, even when the stakes justified the effort. Perhaps some of the sensational headlines and writing may have been cynically gauged to take readers on a ride (to hook readers), but I suspect simple ignorance and lack of effort was the more predominate factor. It's worth remembering next time you read a headline.

If you've grown up in a house with someone who's not "normal," you've probably longed for just that. For just a bit of boring. For just a bit of a 1980s TV sitcom life. For just something constant that isn't pain or abuse or loathing.

I’ve been thinking a lot about “The Game”. No, not Monopoly, although “The Game” is a lot like Monopoly; you’re winning and then the oke buys Eloff Street and starts building hotels and next thing you take a Chance and end up in jail. You gotta mortgage the shit out of your properties, you’re rolling the dice hoping to pass “Begin”, or “Free Parking” and you’re considering stealing from the Bank. Yip I’m talking about the stupid ass game that we play when we meet someone that we like and we pretend we don’t. The game that we play when we start out a new relationship. And believe you me, I am playing very fast and loose with the term “relationship”.

The general tenor throughout is that of a mendacious line being put out by the Cameron Government to suggest that all was rigorously above board – when it clearly wasn’t.

Kevin Mason- Dorothy Day Catholic Worker (29; Washington, DC): “The reasons for my actions had a lot to do with my faith, and my conscience. I believe we are all one family in the human race. We need to get to a place where we do for others as we would want them to do for us. I believe then that justice would flow like a mighty river. Dorothy Day put it this way: ‘Our problems stem from our acceptance of this filthy rotten system’, and this is part of my motivation.”

I am so excited and have been holding on to the secret for a while! I have officially been published and it was not in a magazine but a BOOK! Do you want to know more? Colleen Schaan and Marianne Walker have published their second Copic Coloring Guide - Nature. You can now get your copy at ANNIES ATTIC HERE. If you liked the first book, this one is even better. This book is the next level in the series. Also included with the book is a CD with all the images from the tutorial section of the book. This book is more focused on specific "how to color" techniques like coloring things from black and white objects and foliage to ground and sky (and many more). All the assembly instructions of the cards has been included on the CD allowing more room for samples in the book itself. The book is full of beautiful images with more detail to coloring. Be sure to get yours soon as the demand will be high.
It takes a lot of courage and energy to live in Haiti, most of us live on so much stress. Thieves are everywhere, people are being attacked on broadlight day. Thieves have broken into my house twice (second time we had the time to call the police - although the police did nothing at all) after that it took me quite a while to get back to normal. Always stressed and jumpy, could not sleep, could not eat could not function properly and everytime things seems to get (less worst - not much better, the news of someone you know that has been gunned down while leaving the bank, or getting home late or have been kidnapped would drag me right back to the starting point. Therefore between so many bad news, the politician and the new president of Haiti we can't ask for worst and life is far from being pink.
In my humble opinion one of the core reasons is the deeply rooted tacit acceptance of traditional gender roles. This is undlined by institutional factors: the position of male priests withib Poland or the fact that Pokand has never had a female President or Prime Minister.

I bought this beer over the weekend as part of my world of beers tour at Allyn's Cafe. I wasn't overly impressed with the Ale. It does have a nice copper color, but I didn't care for the citrus flavor, it almost overwhelmed me. I prefer my cooper ales to be a lot smoother and not nearly as bitter. My friend Bill said he liked it and if he were out at the store, would consider buying a 6 pack. I'm glad I tried it at the bar where I only had to drink 1, because I just wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. In contrast to the Mt. Carmel Copper Ale (another Cincinnati beer), it just doesn't stand up.

I abosolutely LOVE this scroll work tree die by MemoryBox.... I needed to add a couple of cardstock shims to get it to cut perfectly but other than that, it makes beautiful cuts! The excess pieces popped out so easily! I have found out from some friends who have used these dies before that I could have run it through my Big Shot with SookWang (Scor Tape) on the back of the cardstock... instead I tried gluing with this card... not easy! Next time I will put the tape on the card and then cut!

Because yes, some of them really are that bad. Once only one person walked into the bookstore during the entire signing. (On the bright side, I did sell him a book, so in that regard it was my only 100% successful signing.) Another time the bookstore obviously forgot I was coming. They'd done no advertising and just set me up in a chair in the corner of the store and ignored me. And I'll never forget the time I brought a pen with golden ink so my signature would be distinctive. It was distinctive all right. It leaked all over the books.

Reprint of the June 1939 issue of The Spider has a very harrowing and politically-incorrect plot; a fiend called The Wreck is kidnapping citizens and surgically crippling and deforming them, making them into a handicapped army of slaves. He even manages to cripple The Spider's girlfriend, Nita! Pretty damn extreme there, Norvell. Needless to say, The Spider is soon relentlessly on the warpath. Fast-paced, action-packed, and kinda creepy.

Tommyknocker is out of Colorado. I thought the Cocoa Porter sounded and looked good. Check out that whimsical label. This looked like a fizzy cola with small foamy light brown head. The nose was strong - cocoa for sure, raisin-y, mostly sweet...Okay, but not that "inviting to the palate." Overall a sweet beer, the cocoa powder is prominant, along with a little honey, some coffee, and something a bit fruity and slightly off-putting. This is on the thin side, moderately carbonated. Overall, meh. I tend to enjoy porters and enjoyed this well enough. Increase the chocolate and decrease the raisin-y taste and you got yourself a deal. B
5. Letting go. I am making an all out effort to downsize my house by letting go of some thing that I have had for awhile and don’t really need anymore. Even though sometimes this is hard for me I know that the reward of having less will be worth it. This “bean” pot I have had for a long time. I used it as a decorative item for many years, especially when my house was decorated with a country theme. But as I move it yearly from place to place it dawned on me that I had outgrown it. The cute hand painted little box was a gift from my mother. It’s sentimental so I’ve kept it, but now I think I can finally let it go too.
Ok I'm back. Actually I poured that beer out, so that's officially a 1 Star beer. So I kept myself from doing any research about Brickskeller beyond the address and the taplist. I had no idea what this place really looked like. And lo and behold it's a damn DUNGEON. We dragass downstairs in a thin stairway through a creaking door, to a poorly lit street level bar. No taps at all. The decor is dark brown stonewalls with rectangular shadow boxes with beer bottles and beer cans. The waitress sits me in the very back of the cutout area, no natural light, in the very back. Very few people in there at the time. I'm thinking that if I eat the food here I could never leave.

MJ has kept a journal for years. It's a beautiful leather book she got from her Aunt Judy. Most days, it sits on our coffee table. It has no lock. Some days, the temptation to take a peek in there is HUGE. But I never have.

I humbly recommend two things here:
Have your student read about the history of Earth Day. After your student is done reading, go over hard words and ask the student to rephrase the paragraph or page. Find examples of different English rules and practices you have been studying (ex. long vowels, consonant blends) and have your student point them out. Then have a discussion about what positive steps have been taken for the environment or possibly what environmental conditions were like in their country of origin.

The beer, which is a deep golden color with a rich, creamy head, gives off an intense and complex Noble hop aroma unlike any other brew. With the first sip, beer enthusiasts will experience an explosion of hop flavor. The intensity of deep citrus, spicy Noble hop flavor is balanced with the slight sweetness from the malt. Due to the quality of the hops, this beer remains balanced and smoothly drinkable from beginning to end. The lingering "hop signature" is an amazing treat for hops lovers.

I had a request from a sweet reader, Brooke, to make a sombrero hundreds chart for Cinco de Mayo and I tried really hard to make one work, but it kept looking like a weird, brightly colored cowboy hat. So, I found a picture of maracas online and thought maybe they would work instead. What do you think? Is it too over the top and cheesy?

The best way to find the “smoking gun” is to follow the smoke to the tip of the barrel.

I am afraid I have perhaps committed the greatest faux pas. I said that I was basing my house on Linda Carswell " Petite Maison", thinking that since I found hers so beautiful, I would like one similar of my own and perhaps hoping to send a little flattery back to the muse. I don't know how, but I didn't see this as a problem at the time! I would actually dearly like to retract my last post and pretend it was never written, but alas, it was and I try to be above all things, honest.

Frankly, if I love a book, I'm buggered if I'm going to let anyone else have it. I don't even lend books, so I'm not sure whether I'll go or not. Perhaps I could bring a book I'm not that keen on and pretend to like it, but I suppose that really isn't entering into the spirit of the occasion.
This one of Picasso's best known paintings, a scandalous, wild depiction of bold, nude prostitutes. Many people consider this painting to be one of the most important in the development of cubism, and indeed, modern art in general.
The remedy of course is Christ and a total revamping and transformation of our minds (Romans 12:1-2). Somehow the Holy Spirit works in us to communicate the love of the Father for us as His adopted children (Romans 8). But we can also benefit in our battle with shame by seeking out help from others the Lord might put in our path. For example, I would recommend Released from Shame: Moving Beyond the Pain of the Past , by Sandra D. Wilson. It is written from a Christian perspective. Probably for many of us, we would do well to get into some kind of counseling and/or therapy group for help in overcoming shame. It is a really big mistake to try to deal with this one by ourselves. Many victims of abuse have so given themselves to helping others – such as their children – that they have neglected to seek help and therapy for themselves. And that is not a good thing to continue to do.

Having moored up and disassembled the oil pressure relief valve again, to try to get it to work, we decided to have lunch at The Broughton Arms, which was some much better than the lunch we had there 6 years ago, things have obviously moved on since then.

Broadly speaking, I think teachers of the art, craft and development of writing fiction - the short story and the novel - divide into two camps. The first contains those who see it as their job to generate ideas: to give exercises which will help students find material they might not otherwise have done: a psychological/emotional approach. The second, which is where I mostly locate myself, assumes that students will come to class with their own ideas, and that the tutor's task - through examples and exercises - is to offer technique, editing, appraisal. Of course they do cross over, but my experience from the first Getting Started course is that students who arrived saying that they had never written any fiction, and didn't know where to begin, had by the end developed work as original, memorable and strong as any I have encountered in many years of teaching.
Yep, I was!

Probably had something with her being a Draenei. Maybe the biters didn’t like the way her blood tasted or the way she smelled. Lucky thing, she was.
How you decide to balance out the flavours is down to experiment. Nevertheless, for my taste, the addition of fresh lemon juice, a little salt, and a good pinch of cayenne pepper transforms a potential ordeal into a genuine pleasure! Actually, what I didn’t do in the video, but would normally do, is add both a small grated carrot and a large ripe tomato to provide a little extra sweetness; on this occasion though I gave my last carrots and the tomato to the pigs for breakfast before filming. Doh!

I recently met with Thomas Hashemi, a teacher at the Robert-Koch-Schule, a Gymasium in one of Berlin’s immigrant neighborhoods. A teacher of philosophy and German, Hashemi is himself a person “mit Migrationshintergrund:” his father came from Iran in the 1960s, married a German woman, and stayed.

The movement supports food and farming policy that is good for the public, good for the planet, and good for farmers and workers. We were asked to bring a dish made with local ingredients if possible, and to write the recipe down so we can compile a “Clean Eats Cookbook”! We had a delicious and nutritious variety of foods to sample, like roasted brussels sprouts with cherries and walnuts, local shrimp and avocado salad, and sweet potatoes with a yummy cinnamon yogurt sauce. It was great to get together with others who share the passion for good, clean eating, and to brainstorm events to get the campus community aware and involved in this movement.
Just then, like it understood me, it did just that! So gorgeous!
When he was mostly dry I led him back to the kitchen. Searching the cupboards I found a tin of stewed meat which I spooned into a Tupperware box and placed on the floor. The dog sat and looked up at me, he didn’t even glance at the food. His tail was swishing back and forth, clearing any debris from that particular spot on the kitchen floor, and he maintained eye contact with me. Finally I realised he was awaiting my permission: so, not a stray. In fact, a very well trained and behaved dog. I gestured to the box and, in a high sing-song tone, said ‘Go on then.”
At that Jordan cracks up laughing and I have to laugh because how am I supposed to explain this?? I have to tell him because if I don't he'll hear it from another kid and will undoubtedly be misinformed. I have to tell him because I used to hate it when people said "I'll tell you when you're older." I have to tell him because it's the right thing to do. And I did.

2011 VW Passat does not sell in the U.S. In designing the 2012 model, it was concluded that the European-sized Passat 2008-2010 generation is too small to midsize car to compete as a true American. So enlarge the all-new 2012 model by more than three inches in wheelbase and overall length, creating the most prominent class-dimensional measurements in each. Cabin comfort is very good. Especially noteworthy is the car’s rear seat accommodation a shame that larger and more expensive lots.Previous Passats offered sedan and wagon body styles, but the 2012 model comes only as a sedan.

Plus their postage is very reasonable. I'm not in any way associated with them, I'm just one of their happy and satisifed customers that's why! :)

A number of possibilities present themselves. First, Sutton and his task force and/or the ACNA leaders supporting the initiative are seeking to establish the ACNA in a leadership role in relationship to GAFCON and the global south Anglican community. Historically Americans seem themselves as destined to be world leaders. Because they are more conservative than their counterparts in the Anglican Church of Canada and The Episcopal Church does not mean that they have abandoned such pretensions. The ACNA is moving in what may be described as an Independent Catholic direction—toward a charismatic and evangelistic-minded but unreformed form of Catholicism, which, since it is also found outside of Anglican bodies, cannot be characterized as Anglo-Catholicism. A small but growing body of evidence exists that elements within the ACNA and its ministry partner, the former AMiA, now the Anglican Mission, are seeking to influence GAFCON to move in the same direction and away from the Reformed Catholicism of historic Anglicanism. Since the Thirty-Nine Articles affirm that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Father and the Son, the GAFCON Primates’ endorsement of such a change in the Nicene Creed would amount to a rejection of the doctrine of the Articles, which its authors believed was consonant with Scripture. The Anglican Church of Rwanda has promulgated a new constitution and set of canons that are the work of a former Roman Catholic priest in the Anglican Mission and incorporate the doctrine, language, norms, and principles of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law and affirm the dogmas of the Council of Trent and the Counter-Reformation. The Rwandan Church is spearheading a movement in the global South community for a revamping of Anglican ecclesiology that builds upon the work of the same priest. Historic Anglicanism may be described as under a two-pronged attack from liberalism and Catholicism that originates in North America and particularly in the United States.

Don’t date a girl who reads because girls who read are the storytellers. You with the Joyce, you with the Nabokov, you with the Woolf. You there in the library, on the platform of the metro, you in the corner of the café, you in the window of your room. You, who make my life so god damned difficult. The girl who reads has spun out the account of her life and it is bursting with meaning. She insists that her narratives are rich, her supporting cast colorful, and her typeface bold. You, the girl who reads, make me want to be everything that I am not. But I am weak and I will fail you, because you have dreamed, properly, of someone who is better than I am. You will not accept the life that I told of at the beginning of this piece. You will accept nothing less than passion, and perfection, and a life worthy of being storied. So out with you, girl who reads. Take the next southbound train and take your Hemingway with you. I hate you. I really, really, really hate you.

Since it is the time for all the wedding hoopla to take place I decided to have some fun with my Facebook status by posting the following – “What is the name of your Royal Wedding Guest name?

I remember so many years ago when my mother was being abuse by my father, the preacher would flatly prescribe Ephesians 5:22: “wives submit to your husbands.” And so my mother left dejected and the years of abuse continued. In later years in my vocation I would hear a very similar story from so many other women… reaching out to their pastor for help when life outside the church and in her marriage became so very chaotic and painful.

The scenes in which The Ancient One worked showed a batch of very sick Himmelfarbs and other guests arriving at a hospital suffering from apparent food poisoning, the result of "bad shrimp" served at the Bat Mitzvah party. Because he spoke up first, The Ancient One was selected as the member of the mob who threw up as they all entered the reception area. Fortunately, the mixture was fruity sweet, making the 7 or 8 (or maybe more) takes of the scene bearable. It also accounts for the "stuff" on his shirt, as seen below:

My apologies to all of the Beyonce fans who read my blog who may misunderstand the point of this post. I don't hate Beyonce. But apparently, I am viewed by some as one of "those" parents who strive to deprive my children of all fun and joy in life by not introducing people like Beyonce into their lives. I make no apologies for my positions but realize that music is a touchy subject. Even some very fervent, practicing Catholics have a blind spot in this area... not an ignorance, but an ignoring. Most of us do it in different areas of our lives. Some areas are decidedly more difficult to flesh out, but lyrics and lifestyles that very obviously glorify sin and the objectification of human beings... that seems like a Catholic no-brainer.

If this sounds like a strange plot for a pirate movie, it is, and the animators at Aardman Animations (“Wallace & Gromit”, “Chicken Run”) have plenty of fun with it. There’s Darwin’s chimpanzee servant who speaks using flashcards, the Queen’s sinister plot to get her hands on Polly for a rather shocking scheme, and plenty of action and wit to keep everyone entertained. I do have to admit that it took me a while to get into the movie because it meandered a bit at the beginning, but once the plot becomes more clear the movie kicks into gear and keeps up a good pace through to the end. I loved the many visual gags, such as the sails of the ship being tacked up with clothespins, and one of the pirates throwing red tracking markers out the back of the ship to create the red dots seen on the map as they sail the seas. What makes the movie all the more enjoyable is that much of the humor is aimed at adults, so you’ll have plenty to laugh about while the kids giggle at the sight gags.

For starters, let’s dispel this nonsense that states that zombies, in their science fiction capacity, are ‘the living dead’. No, they aren’t. They aren’t dead at all–they’re alive. They are people with a disease that modifies their behavior, and that’s it. They can’t be dead because dead things don’t (and can’t) move around. No disease imparts motility on inanimate matter. No disease can. The disease’s function is to attack the brain, primarily, for the purpose of altering behavior in a specific way (see part 2). Viruses don’t have muscles to move things, even collectively, and even if they did there is very little likelihood they could coordinate together on such a massive scale as to operate a human body in even a rudimentary fashion. Hell, they don’t have *eyes*. Good luck spreading a zombie plague without eyes, super-virus. Sorry, but zombies are living people.

1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: :2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. :4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.

18 “When he sits on the throne as king, he must copy these laws on a scroll for himself in the presence of the Levitical priests. 19He must always keep this copy of the law with him and read it daily as long as he lives. That way he will learn to fear the LORD his God by obeying all the terms of this law. 20This regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud and acting as if he is above his fellow citizens. It will also prevent him from turning away from these commands in the smallest way. This will ensure that he and his descendants will reign for many generations in Israel.
This a keg returner. See, if you've got an empty old keg, or even a part-full one, you could fill it up with slops and then re-pressurise it. After that, I suppose you could sell it. Perhaps you could even sell watered beer. But who'd do such a thing?

It’s amazing how many times God “gives peace” to people who are doing the exact opposite of what He said in Scripture. Just because you feel comfortable about your decision doesn’t mean God has given you peace. Perhaps all it means is that you’ve started to have better sleeping and eating habits so you physically feel better. Perhaps it means you’ve seared your conscience so badly that it isn’t functioning anymore.
“When you’re testing 43 different economic indicators over a sample of just 16 elections, the best-performing ones are likely to have been a little lucky. In fact, the relative rank of the economic indicators has historically been very inconsistent: those that perform best over one set of elections do not do much better over the long-term.”

A socially responsible entrepreneur is someone who starts a business with the goal of serving society in one way or another. Sometimes they are individuals who decide to find a solution to a particular problem in society. They take matters into their own hands rather than waiting for government or established business to do something about the problem. Others identify a need and set off to fulfill the need. Businesses can be set up as non-profit or as profit-making models, however the profits are folded back into the business. Some main differences between socially responsible enterprises and charities are their structure and governance. Socially responsible enterprises are free to set up whatever business model they deem appropriate rather than being dictated to by government requirements.

There's a church near where I live. It's a nice church, the kind with big signs outside saying "JESUS SAVES" which is totally zeitgeisty given our current economic woes and the fact that everyone is looking for savings wherever they can. Only, it turns out the church isn't offering a discount on tithes which means "JESUS SAVES" is totally false advertising and it should come with an asterisk beside it then "but not your money" in tiny letters at the bottom and I think the church should just quit it with the sneaky but I don't care because I've got a pogo stick.

If one alters the DNA of any organism, does that make the organism different? And does that mean it could then be harmful to us? I do not see how anyone should be allowed to alter our food supply until they know it could not harm us in any way. This should take many years before we would know the answer to that question. So…that makes me feel like I am being part of the big experiment here. And I do not want to be part of this. I will choose to grow my own food before I will eat any more of their GMO food.

There's a bit of trouble brewing for Boy Scout Troop 11 of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and it threatens to end the 100 year-old history of that group. According to a story on Huff'n'Puff, a Latino group called "Latino Rebels" saw a patch being used by a 'patrol' from Troop 11 and has complained about it to the national organization of The Boy Scouts of America. The offending patch shows the iconic image of illegal immigrants on the run pictured on many border patrol signs near our southern border.
Nooyi’s 2011 compensation included $1.6 million in base salary, up from $1.3 million, her first increase in base pay since becoming CEO in 2006. Stock and option awards totaled $9.5 million, roughly equal to year-ago levels, while her incentive plan compensation fell to $2.5 million from $3 million last year.

A historic stopping of the clock at Parliament to ram through 8 bills has also stirred worry. What is happening, are there hidden clauses that the BN wants to push through to further strengthen its hand ahead of the 13th general election? Maybe. It might also be that BN wants to clear as much of its in-tray as possible before dissolving Parliament.

With the above in mind, my topic this month is Beer Redemption.I am not afraid to say that I am not a fan of Magic Hat. Pre-sell out, post-sell out, whatever. I have told this to bartenders, friends, random people and even their sales rep. Some of their beer to me, just isn't very good. Some of it is downright awful. Sure it isn't a disgusting macro light lager, but #9 isn't a beer that I order at the bar.

I recently received a multi-package of Crystal Clay* from the fine folks at Fusion Beads. It came with four colors of earthy resin clays, some crystals to imbed in the clay, and a channel bead* to cover in clay. While I am a die-hard ceramic lover, I always like to see what other kinds of materials are on the market, especially clay-like types of materials. This is a fun little packet that has a lot of potential.

That's really all it takes to write a successful press release. It's a unique writing exercise that gives us the opportunity to create another effective marketing tool for our books. There is a world full of free press out there—and now you know how to grab some of it.
The ComiColor series ended in 1936 and Iwerks’ studio struggled along for a couple of more years. Soon, the other knock-offs—the Rainbow Parades, the Color Rhapsodies, the Happy Harmonies and so on—came to an end as well. You see, another of the knock-offs, the Merrie Melodies over at Leon Schlesinger found something other than colour and fairy tales. They found humour. They even made fun of all those colour fairy tale Disney knock-offs, something that carried on into the television animation age.
Black women invented feminism, IMO. It was forced upon us by the system of slavery when we were brought to this country. Black women have always worked and dealt with the balances of work, relationships and family. That isn't new to Black women. Each of us can look back into our families that have a tradition of the woman being financially independent of her husband - 'having her own', as they used to say. My grandmother, born in 1885, by the time she married and had her first child, in 1905, was a college graduate. She went on to birth 15 children, between her first, and her last - my mother- in 1930. While only one of my Uncles went to college, ALL my grandmother's daughters went to college and each of them got a graduate degree. Look at the dates; it's definitely pre-modern feminism. Yet, my family is not unique. There were others, but mainstream society has chosen to ignore them.

Asian brides, especially the Indian bride is quite different in her looks and even has a quite different taste of dressing, hair styling and makeup for the wedding day as compared to others. Most of the Indian brides like to wear heavily decorated Indian wedding sarees and lehngas for the d-day and therefore usually prefer the Asian bridal makeup which best complements these heavily decorated dressing styles.
Because we’re in Scotland, we’re doing the Scottish Census (in fact, if all you follow is the Scottish news you might be hard pressed to discover that the census was also happening in other parts of the UK). It being Scotland, which does not in any way have a chip on its shoulder about anything, many of the choices seemed designed largely to put the English in their place. As someone born into the C of E, my religion, had I chosen to fill it in, would have been a write-in answer – maybe I should have gone for Jedi Knight or even Great Good God of Cycling after all – and under ethnic group the tick boxes included White Scottish, Irish, Gypsy, even Polish, but the English were going to have to lump themselves in with the Welsh as ‘Other British’. Take that, English oppressors!
It had seemed after this situation that Leaf had overcome his addiction and found a comfortable life back home in Montana. Then this weekend, on March 30th, he was arrested after the U.S. Postal Service tipped the Central Montana Drug Task force a month earlier about suspicious deliveries to Leaf’s home. Leaf was apparently receiving packages of pain pills twice a week from Florida for which he was paying $500 to $700 per delivery. He was asked to come to the Great Falls Probation and Parole Office where a search discovered 20 oxycodone pills that seem to have been stolen from one of his friend’s house. After posting $76,000 bail, he was released .

The Sahara desert used to be THE major source for dust, but there are other smaller seasonal sources, such as glaciers grinding rocks in Alaska. The amount of dust is rising, and global dust season is lengthening due to both growth in dust sources (industrialization and desertification) and lengthening of local dust seasons.

Right now I’m kind of doing some light reading. On the humorous side. This book called Mortified. It’s a collection of stories I heard about through a This American Life piece…anyways, it’s just a compilation of different stories from different people. Really embarassing diary entries, notes between friends…Mortified actually travels as a group and they read their stories themselves. It’s pretty hysterical.

Four years ago Dan was turning 65. We thought we’d throw a huge barbecue in our yard for the event. What better time to build a new patio. We had some outside help but did quite a bit of the work ourselves. It is a rather large patio that took months to build. As July 28th drew closer and closer I began to panic. I couldn’t imagine having the project completed on time.
By all accounts, Ergo is a competent company that has fairly won the contract, but I have a feeling in my waters that this procurement and the resulting IT system will be a subject of interest at a future Committee of Public Accounts hearing.
“With each new vintage, I recall why I enjoy making wine. Starting fresh each spring energizes me. My sense of personal renewal shows in our popular Chardonnay.

Our Chardonnay is always invited.”~ Fetzer.com

the Koran's ripe bananas replacing Tell's apple, - it's true enough in itself but what has William Tell got to do with anything? The final version's "I notice by the perimeter" seems a flat line to me, and the transitions don't really work - from striking image, to gazing around, to scene-setting and Trivial Pursuits. The opposite way - zooming in - seems better, "like holes" being the stanza's punchline. But at least the final version quickly introduces the characters, which readers often prefer. The other versions don't have an 'I' at all, which is more characteristic of me, I think.
Durante los años 60, graba para los sellos Columbia y Epic. En 1962, se unió a Benny Goodman, actuando en el celebre concierto que la orquesta del clarinetista, ofreció en Moscú y participando en 1963 en las grabaciones en la Universidad de Yale. En 1965 se convierte en el acompañante oficial de Tony Bennett, realizando dos giras por Europa ('65, '66). Además, en 1966, viaja a Austin, Texas, para asistir a un festival de jazz acompañando a Coleman Hawkins . Mientras está en Texas, graba un LP con la Happy Jazz Band de Jim Cullum (Happy Jazz Records). En 1968 Bobby graba con Billy Butterfield en el sello Verve un disco de música brasileña. A finales de los años sesenta forma un quinteto con Vic Dickenson, que pasa gran parte del tiempo de gira. Finalmente se instala en The Roosevelt Grill en Nueva York con un grupo que incluía a Vic, Dave McKenna, Jack Lesberg y Leeman Cliff. El grupo produjo varios álbumes en el sello Chiaroscuro con la denominación "Live at The Roosevelt Grill, 1970".

(Entering the Countdown for the First Time) 5.)

See my collar bones? Well, they used to prove to me how ‘good’ I looked. If I didn’t feel they were sticking out far enough I would restrict more and more. As of now, they kill me to look at. My upper body has always been more skeletal than the rest of my body. I guess it’s just the first spot on my body to lose weight. What bothers me the most is that you can see my chest bones. Once upon a time, I thought that was the ultimate achievement. How disgusting.
It’s true. Your dry weight is almost completely corn derived. In other words, the carbon atoms and various other organic compounds that make up your body were once in a corn field in Iowa.

What makes all of this so worse is that criminals are almost "protected". Homeowners may not shoot an intruder unless the intruder first shoots them. To shoot an intruder means going to jail - as though you, the victim, are the criminal.

Nothing worked. What frustrated me more was that I couldn’t even locate the painful spot. It seemed to be all around the knee. I finally decided to pay a visit to the nearby clinic. The GP that attended to me had only one advice – rest and stop running. She then explained the detriments of the sport, which I thought was inappropriate, especially to a runner. I was given some anti-inflammatory pills that I’d started taking two days before the race. I did complete my first BHM, four minutes short of a new personal record. But not without pain, of course. This time, it started at the 15th km and dragged all the way to the finish line on the track of the Bukit Jalil National Stadium. After the run, it was difficult for me to walk straight. Climbing stairs was a nightmare. BHM came and gone in a blur, but I still remember the happy moments of meeting old and new running friends. There, I was told that pain in the knee is a serious issue and that to ensure a long running life, I should seek opinion of a specialist and keep in mind the possibility of conducting an MRI scan.

I not only use my cell phone frequently, but when I'm not using it, I keep it in my pants pocket. I also sleep with it right by my pillow because I use it as my alarm. After reading these articles, a part of me wanted to drown my phone in the hot tub again. But let's be realistic here. I know, I know, generations of people got along just fine without cell phones, but I don't really want to go that route. There's got to be a way to have and use a cell phone, but cut down any potential risks too.

Hey, it was time for a change. I'm sure you noticed the new look! I'd love to hear your feedback on it! I thought the brighter, more vibrant colors would be a bit more stimulating for this desperately hot summer. (Perhaps that's a bad thing?) Geez, it took me a long time to find where to put the html code necessary to center the titles, of all things--but I couldn't leave them all the way up in the left hand corner. One would think that would be a bit easier... but the programming I did at the beginning of my blogging life came back, I guess, since I didn't spend as much time as I did in the early days. And I came across a treasure trove of adorable cat pictures (which I love to see) so I added a place for them.

Sullivan was born in Louisville, KY. His father was a sportswriter for the Louisville Courier-Journal. In his first book (Blood Horses), he recalls moving from Louisville to Columbus, Ohio, when he was twelve; in his new one, he says he grew up in southern Indiana, not too far from where Axl and Michael grew up. He attended the University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee, and now lives in Wilmington, N.C. with his family. Currently the (first) Southern editor for the Paris Review, Sullivan was previously an editor at the Oxford American magazine and has written for Harper’s and GQ.
So yet again we have a story that seems to be about the horrible consequences that follow from itself. But this one ends up playing with unusually inflated stakes. The use of HG Wells is, of course, because of his role as the progenitor of science fiction. This isn’t quite true, of course, but clearly we’re not going to start worrying about that here of all places. And so the implication of the story is that really crap Doctor Who is the secret origin of all science fiction. Timelash thus positions itself, with hilarious hubris, as the logical endpoint of all science fiction - the point where everybody caught up to what HG Wells had really been doing when he invented the genre.
If I or somebody I loved was in that situation, I don’t think I could bring myself to tweet the experience, but I appreciate the need to vent somewhere, obviously. (If I didn’t feel the need to vent, I don’t think this blog would exist.)
When Christians speak of “giving their testimony” they are usually referring to telling the story of their conversion experience. There are qualifications for giving a testimony. The most obvious is: In order to give a testimony, you must be born again (John 3:7).

Falling softly to the ground
When I was little, my grandma used to make my sister and I crochet or plastic canvas Easter baskets every year. Some were quite small, others were a bit larger. One of mine doesn’t have a handle. She would fill them with Easter grass, a couple of plastic eggs, chocolate, and maybe even a small toy of some sort. As kids, we were always excited to get our baskets, mostly because we wanted to see what Grandma had made us that year. All the stuff inside was nice, but the basket itself was the big deal. Eventually, Grandma’s arthritis got bad enough that she could no longer make the Easter baskets. I still have mine, all of them. They make wonderful Easter decorations, by themselves, or trying my limited floral arranging skills, with flowers.

I am very, very lonely. The small group of close friends who are the special people that one turns to when something like this happens all live very far away. The nearest being 500 miles away.

I also enjoyed the other subjects this book presents. One is what is often called invisible chronic illnesses. Daisy has a severe allergy to bee stings. She carries an epi-pen. Her friend has cancer but you can't tell physically. The way people draw away from the person with the illness and the adjustments to life were also dealt with briefly. I thought that was pretty well done. You hardly ever see that in YA. In fact you hardly see this at all.
There is absolutely nothing left to the imagination. Some scientists are looking for a cure for Alzheimer's and are testing on animals. They have a breakthrough and one of their test subjects, a chimp, becomes extremely bright, has a baby chimp who also has an intelligence on a par with a human for its age. People get scared, treat the chimp like shit, the chimp rebels with its chimp strength enhanced by its supercharged evolving brain and liberates the rest of the monkey world by turning the Human's Alzheimer's research against them.

Megazooms are alive and well, despite all the attention given to smaller, compact interchangeable lens cameras. And Panasonic has done a good job with its latest long zoom, the 12 megapixel FZ150. In challenging conditions the FZ150 gives better image quality than its predecessor thanks, in great part, to Panasonic’s decision to go with a much more capable 12 megapixel CMOS sensor instead of the FZ100′s unimpressive 14MP unit. A wide angle, image-stabilized 24x (25-600mm) zoom, raw mode, full manual and automatic controls, an articulated LCD, full HD video and 3D capture are only some of this highly capable camera’s feature highlights but look away from the impressive spec sheet and you’ll find that image quality is very good too, across the span of the camera’s 24x optical zoom lens.

Yeah, that's right everybody. Lost completely stole the ending of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I feel cheated. BTW, I also felt cheated when I got to the end of Chronicles of Narnia, which I started reading because of my love of all things Harry Potter. Oh, wait, you didn't know that they're all connected?
He fulfilled over 400 old Testament prophecy's, even the worlds greatest con man could never pull that one off! (in my opinion)

While waiting for it to dry...we decided we needed a few hours out of the house...where do you go in a tiny town when the streets roll up at 4 p.m/? and you have paint all over yourself? Well...on a date of course...to the COMPOST PILE! We elected to forego the tradition of Little Ceasars Pizza...for those of you that haven't read that post? (You can read that here) We had a tradition last summer...we would hop in the truck...grab two Little Ceasar's Pizza's and cruise the City Compost Pile...it seems that it has become our favorite place...to gather building materials and garden waste...and lot's and lot's of other things....

Oh man did I regret that shit. Even now, the images come back to me in flashes at the oddest times, usually while eating. I don't think I'll ever be the same.

What a relief! It’s not my job anymore to fix him. It never was my job, though I certainly did make it mine. Whether he believes in God, as I do, or not, God still love him, and watches him, and any of his behavior falls into God’s providence, not mine. Oh, thank God! I can truly let go now and hopefully forgive! Amen to that!

I'm still on the hunt for Margaret Kelly Langdon, the sister of my great grandfather, Daniel Kelly. I've tracked her to about 1918 in Kansas City, when she was living with one of their brothers. I'm hopeful that a couple entries I've discovered for her will end up being a match.
“Lord Jesus Christ, you offer us a new birth in the Holy Spirit. Renew in me the gift of faith and new life in your Holy Spirit. Help me to draw near to you and to believe in your life-giving word. May your kingdom come and may your will be done in my life today, tomorow, and always.” http://www.rc.net/wcc/readings/apr16.htm

The small sculpture which I use on my company branding sits in my garden and was bought one day when I was working in London. I popped out for a sandwich, wandered into a local gallery, and fell in love with it. It wasn’t massively expensive (though more than I’d expected to spend that particular lunchtime!) but as far as I’m concerned it was worth every penny. I enjoy it 365 days of the year.
Cheezus played the Axiom several times, too. One of our most fun shows was when we played there with the Shoulders and deSchmog in the summer of 1991. Later that year, we were playing the Axiom with 27 Devils Joking when the TABC showed up. You could usually tell when a raid was going down because the agents always seemed to be wearing khakis and blue blazers.
The diagnosis comes as a relief, really. At least I know my own actions, in no way, can be blamed.
Let the Spirit of the Living God who resides in you be your comforter and teacher. Give Him more of God’s Word and insight will be yours. Wisdom comes from Knowledge of God which is found only in His Word as explained by His Voice. He will remind you of EVERY Promise that God has for you when you need it the most. Peace is produced by faith in God translating His Word by His Spirit!

Do you all remember this sweet little face? This was the very first time that we laid eyes on our son! He was perfect! We were probably the first people to truly rejoice over his life. We were completely overjoyed and overwhelmed with emotion. To finally hold this precious little life in our hands was a moment we will never ever forget!

On July 25 we played a good game of European Handball. European Handball is a game you play in the outdoors and all you need is six cones and a rubber ball. The campers started to win in the beginning. The Iron Men which are all the counselors and directors were too strong because of CJ’s fast moving and good throws and because of Benny’s good blocks. Even though we lost by one for the most part it was a good game.

Now I must admit that I was a bit hesitant to read this book because I loved "The Commander And The Den Asaan Rautu's" Rautu so much and I was a bit concerned that in reading this book, knowing that it was about his parents (and perchance him as a youngster), would perhaps alter what I thought about him. However, after having read only a few pages of this book all my worries were forgotten as I recalled how exceptional Michelle is not only at her world building, but also her character development- talents which completely draw the reader in, making them impervious to everything going on around them. I don't think it possible for the reader to not fall in love with Khantara, the most kindhearted and selfless giant EVER, and Anelta, the most gracious and eager-to-learn character I have ever read of before!

Grubbs' Banana Cabbage, Potato Lettuce, Onion Orange (Table Of The Elements, 1997) is an avantguarde record along the lines of Loren Mazzacane Connors. The album is made of three solo numbers: one for piano, one for electric guitar, and one for acoustic guitar. But Grubbs' well-mannered and static style brings to mind the work of Morton Feldman and the meditations of Japanese classical music rather than Mazzacane's experiments. Grubbs gives vent to some whims of his own with the last two tracks, Potato Lettuce (twelve minutes) and Onion Orange (sixteen minutes), that skirt Cage-like silence. Ideally, this album represents the end of a long journey through the labyrinth of sounds, a journey launched with Squirrel Bait, continued in Bitch Magnet and Bastro, and perfected in Gastr Del Sol.

My One and Only starts the story of Harper James, the quick-witted, pessimistic divorce attorney men and women tend to hate or love depending on whom Harper represented in the divorce. While Harper’s live has never been peaches and roses, as of lately it is made a great turn for the better. Business is booming, and she is in a long-term relationship, one that she hopes will turn to marriage soon than later. However, everything changes when Harper runs into her ex-husband, Nick, at her younger sister’s wedding. Seeing him after all those years, brings the memories tumbling back…the good and the bad as well as some old feelings- feelings that could change everything once again. All she knows is that she needs to get away from his as fast as she can, which makes the fact she is stuck going on a road-trip with him all the worse. Will everything be changed once again? Whom will Harper end up with- her fiancé or her ex-husband? Better yet, what really happened between Harper and Nick all those years ago? Only time and more pages will tell in this contemporary read made of pure win.
If language is intrinsically embodied and embedded, then what does that mean for its acquisition? Obviously, if language is learned for worldly use, the learning process itself must be use-based. In this view, language learning is not primarily about squirreling away abstract linguistic competence in an isolated cognitive space,… Rather, language learning is a process of building meaningful ways of participating in socio-material worlds — of constructing flexible, reliable, and therefore survival-enhancing repertoires of ecosocial participation. (Churchill. et al. 2010, p.249).
As luck would have it, there are a bunch of winos out there, and I have an uncanny ability to find and befriend them. So for OTBN we called a couple of these relatively ‘new’ friends up and happily, they came over (otherwise I would never pull the corks on these suckers–OK, I would have, but since my wife has never been confused with a boozer, I would be drinking these puppies alone and that’s just pathetic). While planning what to have for dinner, we decided to serve oysters and I was going to try a new lamb stew recipe (new to me, at least). Normally, I would not try a new recipe for the first time when guests were coming over, but I figured there would be so much wine, no one would notice if the food sucked. Besides, since we had never served or shucked oysters before, either, the probability was very high that I would put a 17 inch gash in my hand, need to be rushed to the hospital, and end up canceling the dinner anyway.

We continued through Eugene to Reedsport - at times in a downpour. Rob enjoyed testing himself and his new tires on the wet pavement from Reedsport to Sutherlin. After a beautiful detour from I-5 on the Cow Creek Road between Riddle and Glendale, we continued on to Grants Pass for the night, which included snacks and drinks on the patio.
So I rested. Drank hot whiskey (honey, lemon, Jameson, hot water, mug, ahhhh). Slept and slept. Got Tamiflu (that stuff is a miracle).

She shuddered and forced herself to watch the mourners gathering around the grave at the base of the hill. The black-clad figures clung to one another, finding comfort in knowing they didn’t mourn alone. Comfort Emma couldn’t share. Even from where she stood at the crest of the cemetery, their shock and grief and anger pounded against her.
TimeBuddy is a unique approach toward helping children aged 3-7 to understand the concept of time, without first having to learn how to tell time. The clock arrives disassembled, and with adult supervision and assistance, your child will choose how to decorate the entire clock with the provided stickers. They will choose which color to use for the outer rim, and then they can add a cute smiley face if they desire and then beginning choosing from 150 different removable stickers that help identify the activity they need to do at a certain time. Then, three different alarms can be set to alert the child when certain activities need to be done! This alarm can be personalized with the child's name and a cute prerecorded message from TimeBuddy (which really makes this "buddy" come to life). This one of a kind product offers children a tool toward learning time management skills and helps them become familiar with daily routines.

Additionally they have done the exact opposite of what he intended regarding his name. We read in Psalm 83:18 "That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth" (KJV). Yahveh clearly had big ambitions for his name and regarded himself as ruling not only the Israelites but all the earth. And even in the Ten Commandments, he stressed the importance and dignity of his name -- forbidding disrespectful use of it.
Suffice it to say that it was unwise, in hindsight, for the New York Times to essentially declare the story over after the 2006 approval, promoting to Albany the Brooklyn-based reporter who was finally starting to understand the landscape.

The bottom line is that he will be at Tennessee for two more seasons. The idea of Bray leaving for the NFL after 2012 is simply not plausible as things currently stand. So let’s hope that the coming maturing process over the next two years can put Tyler in a position for NFL success. If that happens, that will mean good things for the Vols.

I then had weekly visits in my home by the midwives from the team. Since I transferred I havent had to leave my house for anything - actually the only blip was that my iron was low (8.6 and it needs to be at least 10)) and if your blood count is low, they advise against homebirth in case you bleed a lot and pass out. So I had to take iron tablets for 3 weeks (so three weeks of black poop) to get my levels back up. I took myself to the hospital to get a blood test to prove my levels were up after two weeks as the thought of not having a homebirth cos of IRON really annoyed me. Thankfully it went back up to 11.6 and all was fine!

Imaginary Future is pleasant enough to listen to in the background, and most songs contain nice hooks to keep the audience going in live context. Songs like You Don’t Know and Convict are catchy sing-along chants that are sure to get a few ‘o-o-o-ooos’ out of you.
There are other noteworthy aspects of the film too. The magnificent (cliché busting) scene in which George’s shadow recognises that he’s a shadow of his former self and walks away. The camera movements throughout are exemplary, especially when it inverts so beautifully in the shot of George reflected in a mirrored-table. The blocking (i.e. the positioning and movement) of actors and extras in the staircase scene is outstanding. The way sound is introduced (in the film and the world of the film) is absolutely delightful. The fantastic score and fantastic sets. The use of silent era editing techniques, like the iris (to mark big transitions between scenes) and the headline news montage sequence (to drop in exposition and push the story forward). And all of the other subtle film references (for instance, the shot of the most famous studio gates in the world and the loyal Chauffeur character played by James Cromwell which echo Wilder’s Sunset Boulevard). All of it - utterly utterly marvelous, and a fitting tribute to the best of Hollywood film history.

But the good news is that it means that there is still a chance!

I would be least surprised if they did.

The Artist is the story of silent movie star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) and the advent of the "talkies" in 1927 that marks the proverbial death knell for his career. His life intertwines with the young ingenue Peppy Miller (Bernice Bejo and wife of the film's director Michael Havanavicus) who plays a dancer hell bent on stardom. The French romance film is a great story of the rise and decline of stardom in early Hollywood and won Dujardin the Best Actor Award at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. (Even the Jack Russell terrier Uggy won the Palm Dog Award for best canine performance!). Viewers will also recognize actors John Goodman, Malcolm McDowell, James Cromwell, and Penelope Ann Miller in supporting roles.
There are other realms as well, as you know—the dominions, the virtues, the principalities, the powers. Each has their distinct role.

The drive to control the deficit is expected to force hard choices in many areas, with more revenue prospects on the table.

I have also spent a great deal of time with people who had at one time in their lives had thoughts and behavior that were so bizarre they were extremely frightening for their families and even themselves; they were diagnosed with schizophrenia and other psychoses, but have fully recovered and have been, for many years, leading productive lives. Among this population, I have not met one person whom I would not consider a major anti-authoritarian. Once recovered, they have learned to channel their anti-authoritarianism into more constructive political ends, including reforming mental health treatment.

My main issue with remakes is that they’re written by people who don’t understand or have the same motivation for writing or making the new film as the originators. Rarely is a remake undertaken with true passion for the subject and in horror, it seems that most remakes are written by fans who want nothing more than to leave their mark on their favourite franchise (witness how lovingly the Elm Street remake writers poured over Freddy’s backstory and left the rest of the characters, especially Nancy Holbrook, whose model, Nancy Thompson, was written for a specific reason and with purpose, out to dry...but I digress.)

In his promo pics, we see Mugison variously riding horses in mountainous terrain, casually laying down on ice caps, and canoeing through rocky waterways dressed as a fish trapper-- no boring brick-wall backgrounds for this guy.

The Unremembered is Peter Orullian's debut novel although he has published a few short stories in various anthologies the last few years. The series is named The Vault of Heaven, which brings a lot of things to mind. Definitely something on an Epic scale. The Unremembered will be released in April 2011. I know that is a long time, but it certainly could be a strong Epic Fantasy debut. Next year is ramping up to be one of the most competitive years for Fantasy with new books by Abercrombie, Rothfuss, Lynch, Morgan, Abraham, and Grossman. There are also sequels to a number of my 2010 debut favorites coming out, but I always like to make time for debut authors so I'll definitely be one of the first in line to check out The Unremembered. Here is the description to taunt you with:
Iran: The Armenian Evangelical Church in Tehran is the latest church to be ordered to cease holding Persian services on Fridays. The officers serving the notice threatened church officials, saying that “if the order is ignored, the church building will be bombed ‘as happens in Iraq every day.’” As another report summarizes, “Christians and Churches in the Islamic Republic of Iran are now banned from preaching the Gospel to non-Christians, holding Persian language services, teaching and distributing the Bible, or holding Christian classes.”

My cousin Neal (the super handsome one) made spectacular mojitos. (He also made less-than-spectacular bootleg wine out of frozen Welch’s grape juice, which is how I ended up throwing up for like two hours on my 20th birthday, but never mind.) Mojitos are the only proper cocktail on this list, and they need fresh mint. Luckily mint is very easy to nurture and very hard to kill, so it’s not a hardship to have it around during the summer months when mojitos are best.

In truth, I’d never thought of it as food for humans. I’d known that lichen was a plant-like organism, an abundant hybrid occupying the nebulous space between fungus and algae.

In his book, Rivonia: Operation Mayibuye, H H W de Villiers concluded that the Rivonia conspiracy was not caused by apartheid: "the revolt was inspired by communists. The pattern was copybook communist strategy to create chaos by sabotage, riots . . . to manipulate the indigenous population." It is the still-largely untold story of the ANC's communist connections that remains the greatest threat to SA. Even here a passionately partisan media has twisted things.
Last but not least are the fun goodies. There is the choice of detection powers and spell-like abilities. The detection powers can only be used once a round and vary from simple things like detecting good in a 20' area to detecting sloping passages though I am slightly disappointed at the available variety as it is clearly missing the detect meal and what kind power which was present in OD&D and is the power I would want because of all the interesting uses it has. Now to segue into the spell-like abilities I will mention that on a roll of 98 to 100 on the detection table you get a spell-like abilities instead. Abilities of which only a bright brand with an intelligence of 12 will always have are usable 3 times a day and go from a simple double damage for 1d10 rounds to Teleportation. All of the abilities barring the double damage and regeneration are based straight off of something else, most generally a Magic User spell though a few are from magic items. This mostly wraps up this scintillating post though I would like to mention that by the book it is slightly more "broken" then in OD&D as you can get all the detection powers and all the spell-like abilities as many times as you like because the rolls that let you roll on the tables again are not restricted though as the DM is the person that should be rolling these up it should not be any problem at all.

Occupy Wall Street took Zuccotti park on 17 September 2011, by December 2011 Verso published 'Occupy!: Scenes from Occupied America'; it also bears witness, but from up close. The book begins and continues with diary-like reports on the atmosphere of camp and marches, the deliberations during general assemblies, the internal strife between the drummer circle and the rest, the problems of camps not being truly representative of the 99%, the doubts and insecurities that slowly creep in, the mayhem of eviction and of course the logistical nightmare of the laundry. There are 28 authors beautifully edited with each new author adding a new perspective, historical essays on China town, labour unions and consensus decision making, some writers are celebrities like that Hegelian Harlequin (rousing) and Angela Davis (short but strong), unknown writers drop in narratives from other occupation sites. Oakland, Atlanta, Philadelphia each finding a way to deal with the problems generated by local historic and political circumstances. The book is consistently intelligent (there are only two contributions that I like less for being abstract) and well-paced, all the more remarkable for the immediacy of its subject and speed of its production. The design also gets top marks.
a blood-thirsty condemnation which could just as easily be applied to more recent periods in history, and possibly even modern-day America, as 19th century Prussia.

The story is told by a forty-four-year-old man writing on 1st August 1979 looking back to when he was a boy. Most of the story concentrates on when he was twelve and thirteen but he does jump about a bit in fact the narrator’s quirky perception of time is one of the delights to this piece. The story itself – a fictionalised memoir – is quite straightforward but he tells the story as he remembers things and this necessitates leaps in time and breaks in the narrative. What he’s really doing is putting off saying what he has to say because no amount of context is going to change it or the effect what is going to happen / has happened has had / will have on his life. If you can picture a forty-four-year-old man looking back to when he was a twelve-year-old who’s looking forward to when he’ll be thirteen you’ve probably got the right kind of mindset for this book. Of course we remember things differently as we age. Here’s a good example:
Can you please, please, PLEASE learn to be more civil with the cats? They can't take the rough way you like to play with other dogs. They are delicate and temperamental. Be nice, please.
Omar Idilbi, a spokesman for the Local Coordination Committees, an activist network, said security forces simultaneously stormed several districts in the old part of the city, including the Bab Dreib, Bab Houd and the Bayada neighborhoods.

I am so thankful for everything. I love being a mother/wife/sister/daughter/friend even though at times it's stressful and you can't get your own space. I ask God to give me the graces to get through and he is listening to me. I am so thankful for my healthy children and husband, to be able to live in a place where our freedoms are protected and I pray for all those who are suffering whether it be due to poverty, war, persecution of faith/religion/cast, or illness. We should be more kinder to each other and give more readily.

It has been tremendously gratifying for people to ask, "So the things in the book are real, these are things that I can go find?" The answer is yes. When I get letters and e-mail from readers saying how they went and found the things mentioned in the book I feel like I have connected with them.

Pernod—which has sold Havana Club around the world since forming an alliance with Cubaexport in 1993—and Bacardi have been embroiled in the trademark dispute since 1994, when Bacardi applied for a U.S. trademark for Havana Club. Pernod sells nearly 4 million cases of Havana Club annually, even though the brand is embargoed from the world’s largest premium rum market.
John 6:36-40 I told you before that you have seen me, and still you don’t believe. The Father gives me my people. Every one of them will come to me. I will always accept them. I came down from heaven to do what God wants, not what I want. I must not lose anyone God has given me. But I must raise them up on the last day. This is what the one who sent me wants me to do. Everyone who sees the Son and believes in him has eternal life. I will raise them up on the last day. This is what my Father wants.”

William and his father go to visit his grandmother, who bitterly snipes at William for not coming to see her until now. Mrs. Popper, according to her butler Holmes, has been having trouble lately with black boys who run into her yard and climb on her roof; Mr. Popper suggests she allow those boys to set up a youth club in her yard, but she will have none of it (she wants to buy some police dogs for protection). She also reprimands William for his relationship with Jane: "You think I don't know how you live, but I do. I know you're living with a Jewish girl... Don't smile at me!"
Lets break this down:
Good morning lovely friends!
In my opinion, dialogue is the lubricant of the story. It can be used to more effectively define relationships between characters, it is a more powerful way to introduce necessary information than exposition is, and if it’s witty and fresh, it keeps the story from going stale. I am learning to just let my characters talk. I’m realizing that letting go and allowing my characters to speak will not result in them stealing the show and taking the story anywhere I don’t want it to go. Characters are extensions of ourselves and therefore, they share our vision. Worst case scenario, a character gets too talkative. In revisions, it will be easier to delete some of his or her lines than it will be to try to add them in later. Also by not censoring my characters, I’ve learned some important elements of the story that turned out to be useful – so I try to let them talk. I use dialogue as often as it’s acceptable to do so because I’ve learned that when it comes to fictional dialogue, silence is far from golden.

He comes from a very proud heritage you see, he comes from Vikings and warlords or lords of war. They are men just because they fought the fight; any other reason other than strong will does not resonate well with the masses. He was angry for letting his guard down, he could feel his daddy turning over in his grave, his mama looking down from up in heaven in disdain, he could not stomach it, and so he let out a hurl, a heave, a sigh, a gulp and out came the rabbit leg he had taken for lunch. It all came out. He had a foul taste in his mouth, but there were no tooth brushes or toothpaste, all he did was wipe his chin and continue sitting there. After all no one is here to see my shame, and even if they were here, I wouldn’t care that much, wait, I wouldn’t care at all.

After the credit card slip was found, I was able to hop back into the game and quickly make drinks for customers. The first guy I went up to griped at me about how he had waited 20 minutes. I called him out and told him it hadn't been 20 minutes. I asked him if he wanted to order a drink or and argue with me. He told me to shut up. The friend he was with looked mortified and quickly apologized on his friend's behalf. It was too late. I already had a bouncer waiting behind him to escort both of the guys out.
My current book search, as mentioned earlier, remains unfulfilled. The book? I have a copy on loan from a weaving buddy. It is Erica de Ruiter's Weaving on 3 Shafts. I've done my usual searches, and now need to go back and set up notifications. Some day I will have this book, and will be able to scribble my marginalia directly on it, as I work my way through this book stuffed with interesting ideas.

Finally 20% of voters, including 35% of Republicans, support impeaching Obama for his actions so far. I'm not clear exactly what 'high crimes and misdemeanors' they are using to justify that position but there may be a certain segment of voters on both the right and the left these days that simply think the President doing things they don't agree with is grounds for removal from office. I don't think Obama has a lot to worry about on that front.

We had this past Saturday all planned out: we were going to walk over to the Botanic Garden for the Chile Pepper Fiesta then hit up the Grand Army Plaza Greenmarket. A good plan, in theory, but a slow morning led to a late start to the Fiesta. Of course, even though I tack it on the end of every Fresh Finds post, I couldn't remember the hours of the greenmarket. Did it end at 4, or 6? (It ends at 4.)

So what are the lessons of Duvel? It is apostacy among Oregon brewers to add sugar to a beer. Moortgat doesn't even bother with candi sugar--they throw in regular old sucrose. Boosting alcohol with malt means a much heavier, maltier beer. This may be a frontier worth exploring.
So the admonishion that we ‘Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. (Philippians 2:4 KJV)’ is easier said than done. Some may even consider it as idealistic and overly simplistic. However, as it is the word of God, it is what is expected of us.

Many of you are entering a phase where thought patterns are undergoing a shift. There is a shift from ego-based thoughts to heart-based thoughts. There is a subtle shift in perception in many. It is like trying on a new set of clothes, in a new style. It may feel a little awkward and scratchy at first, but as time goes on, it feels more normal. Wear this new set of clothing, this new set of attitudes, lightly and with grace. You do not need to worry about how it looks. From our perspective, you look magnificent. You are learning how to navigate the switch from linear thinking to multidimensional thought.
Now, you ask yourselves, what has this to do with my mother? Well, one of the things she left me (how glad am I that I don't have brothers and sisters) is a letter written by Georges Sand. As I grew up it was always in a frame in the corner of our living room and I took no interest in it. In fact it was only when I went through all my mother's possessions - about 13 years ago now - that I truly looked at this letter. Since I've been in France and have found out a lot more about French culture, and have also started studying times gone by, I now have an idea of just how famous George Sand is. So, I thought, I can sell this letter for vast sums and make a collector happy.
Nick has a history with the council and used to have a very active role with a view to standing as a councilor for Scarborough Council in his local area, not knowing it was a company. Nick started to ask some very interesting questions regarding the councils POLICY (contracts) and subsequently was ousted from the local (con)servative party. Nick took it upon himself to endeavor to find out more and get his questions answered as he started to see strange things start to occur in and around the Scarborough area and surrounding areas. In doing this Nick was led to TPUC and started to talk to me regarding some of the interesting facts he had discovered and highlighted the fact that it was quite obvious that Scarborough Council was conducting business as a company. In doing so Nick started to produce evidence to the fact and is following a course of action to find out even more which will be published by TPUC soon.

Jeff/Annie shippers got their chance to squeal, lovers of the Dean got a great episode from Jim Rash, and lovers of blanket forts got a great set piece and chase scene. Kevin Corrigan is strange and funny in his role as Professor Professorson/Wooley/Garrity, and the plot just keeps unraveling in the most ridiculous ways. Just a super fun episode all around.

Towards the end of last year, you may remember me complaining about an injury to my knee which I sustained while playing hockey. At the time, my “Doctor” informed me that I “may” have torn the ligaments to my outer knee. And, that there was nothing he could do for me at the time. I was told to ice it and stay off of it as much as possible. Which, as a good little soldier, I did. I think, because I have a high physical pain threshold, I thought I was moving my way through the injury. Not so. As the months passed, and the icing and Advil treatment increased, the inflammation has become worse. In the past 2 weeks alone, I have gone through almost 60 Extra Strength (400mg) Liqui-Gel Advil's. Lord knows what that is doing to my stomach.

In Verruca Music the other is also a voice that engages in a dialogue with the body in the bed, correcting him (e.g. when he gets the colour of the duvet wrong) or challenging him in other ways.

Please, if you have not done so already, sign the petition. Then, after you have signed in, share it with your friends and family. Get the word out. This is DuckTales we are talking about here after all. This is the cartoon that put Disney tv Animation on the map in the first place. Shows like TaleSpin, Darkwing Duck, Gargoyles, or even Phineas and Ferb might not exist if it wasn’t for this show, so let’s show it some more love! We were looking for 30,000 signatures, surly for DuckTales we can find that many? At it’s current rate, well get those signatures in a few decades. We here at Open Vault Disney know deep down there are at least 30,000 DuckTales fans who want to see this happen, if not more. So please, help us out and sign the petition. After the first 1,500, we’ll create another one for Ludwig von Drake and his Wonderful World of Color staring episodes, but only if DuckTales starts to pick up. Thanks everyone.

First few pages in and I can feel Froi’s character so strongly! I was smiling, laughing, and realizing how much I missed the characters from Finnikin of the Rock. I devoured every page, more so when I finally came into his scenes with Quintana. Quintana is unlike any character I’ve ever read! Marchetta built a character so brilliant that I loved Quintana from beginning to end (her unflinching dark past included). Froi’s and Quintana’s personality are both tough and resilient, but in a strange way they do not overpower each other. They complement each other that eventually their relationship flowed into one solid, unbreakable bond. Every scene is charged with electricity. Be it sweet or savage, it hooked me down to my seat. Their relationship was so different from Finnikin and Evanjalin, but it was riveting nonetheless. The new characters are very distinct in their roles. Among them, I loved Arjuro the most. Such a filthy mouth for an old priestling. Ha! But he’s sensible and touching beneath the grunts and growls.

Even beyond that, though, religion permeates our culture, our language, our traditions, our public rituals, our history, and yes, our political debate. More than anything else -- more than political party, more than political history, more than any cultural icon whether it be Shakespeare, Star Wars or John Wayne — Christian religion is at the core of what America believes in and relates to. Progressives ignore or dismiss religion at our peril: we will never get to a majority political coalition in this country without understanding religion and the people who believe in it.

For instance, Will or Spirit is seen as an absolute base, animistic instinct, and reasoned or distinct thought. A rock is. It reacts a certain way to various forces, and will change appropriate to certain influences. It will and can do nothing less or more. An animal has the basic will to act and survive, to learn and adapt, but not to reason or make arbitrary decisions that are not based on meeting some basic need. People can decide a flying spaghetti monster exists, come up with the mythology around it, and then not only believe it, but come up with reasoned and rational arguments in that beliefs defense.

I would say keep your options open. Everybody has their price (he said with dripping cynicism). I would write for the love of writing. Self-publish, and if you’re very lucky, the big boys and girls will find you. Then you’ll be in the enviable position of having to decide what it’s worth to give up complete autonomy. If you self-publish first, you won’t have to wait on pins and needles for the mail to arrive – you’ll be out there, published. So if your goal is for people other than the bedridden maiden aunt living next door to read your work, do it yourself. It’s not that hard.

When he made his debut at 21, Brian Lara was supposed to be the next great Caribbean batsman, carrying forward the legacy of Headley, Walcott, Sobers and Richards. Little did people know that this tiny man from Trinidad would one day outshine his illustrious compatriots. In 1994, within the space of two months, Lara broke the world records for the highest individual score in Tests and first class (375 and 501 respectively). Those who think that this was a fluke need to be told that he reclaimed the former record by becoming the first man to score 400 in a single Test innings a decade later. No one has scored more double centuries than Lara (apart from the Don of course) and along with Bill Ponsford, Lara remains the only man to cross 400 twice in his first class career.

On my list, Dani is everything I've ever wanted in a guy. He's annoyingly intelligent, lovely to look at, arty, pretty experimental, responsible, neat, kind, hygienic, floppy hair, good bone structure etc. you get the idea. (Oh and the war, I've got to mention the bit about surviving one of the most tedious wars in the last decade) But until that day at the beach, I never thoroughly thought about how I really felt about him. Knowing he was what I wanted was one thing, and actually feeling it, I guess, was quite another.

Therefore "character" would seem to be the determining factor in the superhero genre. From this affiliation it would follow that a superhero is no less a superhero for having plot-elements borrowed from science fiction, detective stories or even westerns. Scipio actually does argue that Aquaman is "a western character in a frontier setting," though I respond that no one is any more likely to term Aquaman a genuine western than, say, the sci-fi film OUTLAND. On a tangential note, I think a case could be made that Silver Age Aquaman was every bit as much of a "fantasy" as Wonder Woman in its Golden/Silver Age manifestations, though over time both of them became closer to being "regular superheroes."
Johnnys boys are classified as clean cut (in physical form and public image), handsome guys that train from a young age to sing, act, and dance, along with much more to become an all around entertainer, or “idol” as the Japanese call it. This is unlike the west where people only train to be one denomination, such as an actor or singer. They join the agency at a young age and become a “Johnnys Jr’s”, which is basically Johnny’s term for a trainee. The job as a Jr. is basically to back dance for and gain experience from the already debuted groups in the agency in the hopes that one day they will debut in a singing group (or solo) one day. Not all Johnny’s Jr.’s debut, unfortunately, and there are even some Jr’s that are as old as some of the debuted Johnnys.

My grandchildren are doing so well. The baby is getting so big and my goodness is she beautiful! My sons are all fine and my furry babies are great! I hope that yous have had wonderful and blessed holidays filled with love, family and friends! I will try my best to post something at least once a week if my health allows for it. Also, once I start to feel a lil bit better I want to make those wonderful ladies the gifts that I had promised. I've missed so much and feel so bad. I almost feel like I deserted yous, but the reality of everything is that everyone of yous I've held very close to me in my heart all these months and I've thought of everyone and your families very often! I miss yous and hope to be able to stop in at your blogs again very soon. I've said this before and I really mean this from the very bottom of my heart and being. My heart is filled with so much friendship and love, everyone makes me feel so good and you all, each and everyone of yous have all touched my heart in so many different and wonderful ways. I want to thank everyone for your tenderness, love, caring, prayers, friendship healing thoughts and positive energies. For all your cards, calls, gifts and genuine sisterly love! Yous all mean the world to me, thank you! It's wonderful to be a part of this great family!
And now I realise I have been staring at the word "chilli" for so long that it has somehow lost all meaning, and I wonder if it's an actual word, and if it is, have I spelled it right? Or have I written an entire post about something that doesn't exist? Oh gosh, apparently it is spelled (US - SPELT IN THE UK!) "chile" and "chile" in the US. Please excuse me while I go have an aneurysm and give up on life.

Today’s TNT (This-N-That) post from Club Creative Studio is about technique in your creative process. I often find myself playing “the waiting game”.

We wait for the text response, we wait for something to download, we WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
We, us cousins, would scare each other with the threat that the Cucuy was coming. One time we were at our Welo and Wela’s and we were chasing each other and we heard a noise then someone said the Cucuy was coming! Everyone started running and trying to get back to the house (they lived out in the country) and my cousin turned to see behind him then turned back around and POW! ran right into the barbed wire fence. So now we are all scared plus he has this big gash over his eyebrow but, you guessed it, Monkey Blood came to the rescue and saved the day once again!

On my own estimation, Capitalism is nearing its dialectical movement from a free market to a more communal sensitive mechanism where profit if not abolished is turned into a social equitable return which helps the fringes of the market and society. Communism offers a hard pill to swallow but it may prove to be a starting stage for a socially responsive system where no one’s left and we all move into the same direction towards abolition of greed brought by wealth and power in vicious circle or capital and labor.

Hey everyone! I have to write this quick blog post to thank you all. In my 2.5 years of doing YouTube videos, I've never been so pleased or surprised. Most of the time, if I go more than one day without uploading a video, I get an overwhelming amount of tweets, comments, messages, and emails asking me to upload. Normally, I love this! It makes me feel like you all are excited to watch me and it reminds me to do more videos. However, I mentioned in a video and blog post that I was going home for the holidays, and if I didn't upload as much as normal, it was because I was spending time with my family. I have been so shocked at the support I received after this. So many people are writing to me letting me know that it's fine if I skip a little while during the holidays, and to focus on my family. Thank you thank you thank you! Knowing I have your support and love no matter what makes me so happy!

“Captain Bume struck his head from the his shoulders in one swipe of his saber. A second later he was rolling the mast off of me and fighting pirates at the same time, striking them down left and right. He was like Samson himself, sir, knocking men down like they were bowling pins. Threw me over his shoulder and took the time to slap me in the face and yell ‘Mr Tibbs, I’ll have you awake if you please!’ as we leapt from our ship to the pirates’ vessel. Bume had them beat, and left our crippled ship to sieze theirs, and then used their ship to sink the others with all the tenacity of a bulldog. Gave him the Victoria Cross for that; the Queen herself pinned it to his chest.”
Then there was the "shove anything to fill the void while he's content for a moment" diet. That one worked really well, but it's also known as "starving" so the practicality of it being long lasting wasn't practical at all.

In December 1998, Cline’s mother, Hilda Hensley, died in Winchester, Virginia of natural causes. (Cline’s father had died in the 1950s.) Hensley rarely granted interviews, living the rest of her life practicing her craft as a master seamstress in Winchester and helping to raise her grandchildren. Cline’s daughter, Julie, stated in a 1985 People Magazine article: “Grannie loved my mother so much that it’s still hard for her to talk about her.” Hensley stated in her later years that the outpouring of love given to her by Cline’s fans over the years had been amazing. “I never knew so many people loved my daughter,” she told one newspaper.
I started this blog thinking that it would be quite a nice record of my son’s development and a documentation of our life. I knew that I would enjoy writing it, but I never thought that the archives of my blog would be a source of comfort for me. I was reading the blogs I wrote when we first brought Henry home and how much I struggled in those early days. I’m not saying it’s easy now, it will never be easy again, but it isn’t a struggle anymore and I have really learnt so much. If I could give any advice to new parents that are worried about their ability to parent, it would be this; don’t stress about every little thing, and don’t think it will be like that forever. Babies, like adults, have good and bad days, and even one bad week doesn’t mean the next week you won’t be walking around town in the sunshine with your baby cooing gently, playing with his hands and making you smile. It doesn’t get easier, but it gets better. And far more rewarding.

In the last four years, there have been nearly 13 million foreclosure filings, with many more projected for several years to come. State and local legislatures stepped up to the challenge of growing homelessness by further criminalizing homeless people. San Francisco passed an ordinance against sitting or lying on the sidewalk. Memphis gave official blessing to police harassment by creating “No-Panhandling Zones” in the downtown area. As always, capitalist democracy operates in the spirit articulated by Anatole France in 1894:
I must adjust my expectations of my housing situation to meet the new needs of these changing times – live in a smaller space, perhaps in a different neighborhood or city; rent vs. own my home; divide up my large space into individual smaller spaces to rent out, offer or accept a room in a home that has more than enough space, perhaps in exchange for work rendered – on other words, let go of the social status symbols and material demands that have been put on me – and begin to live more freely in a place that suits new circumstances. These changes offer many benefits including a manageable cost for housing, lower energy demands and costs, more freedom of movement when job or personal desire demands it.

I took some bath pictures last night and as usual couldn't believe how much bigger and chunkier she is looking from the last time I took them! She was smiling in all but one of them and wouldn't you know, it was the only one that came out clear, all the others were so fuzzy, I was really disappointed! But oh well, she has become such a frequent smiler I'm sure I will get the opportunity to catch those precious bath smiles again. I just can't get enough of her smiles, they make me so happy! And as you can see she wasn't being very lady like and since this picture is going to be on the internet I did a little editing. Josh is right behind her but she is very good at keeping herself upright nowadays.

About 10 years ago, I was doing yoga 2 to 3 times a day every single day. Needless to say, I stopped. After this 50 lb. weight loss, I found it hard for me to lift things, push a full grocery cart around the store, and carry heavy plates full of food at work. My muscles had deteriorated from years of minimal activity. I had to do something. I felt it was time to renew my interest in yoga.

It is most definitely spring here in northeast Nebraska. I scored my first sunburn a couple days ago. The kids found the little wading pool in its winter storage, pulled it out, and played for hours.

I have really enjoyed the Septimus Heap series. Septimus is the seventh son of a seventh son in a line of wizards. In Magyck, the first in the series, Septimus is stolen the night he is born by a midwife who pronounces him dead. That same night the boy's father comes across a bundle in the snow containing a new born baby girl. The following books reveal who this baby girl is and what happens to Septimus and, eventually, the adventures they share together.

Today, more than once, I found myself staring at my year 10 formal dress & realised that the last time I wore it I was 16 years old 9 weeks into a pregnancy that lasted nearly 14 weeks & no one else who I saw that night knew. No one knew. No one knew until I was 19. Most people still don’t know. Hard is sitting through the sadness, the anger, the frustration. The hardest thing is missing Grace. I don’t think recovery will ever be about ‘getting over it’. I don’t believe in ‘getting over’ sexual abuse & a miscarriage. I do believe in getting through it. I have to believe in getting through it. I survived that. I can survive this.

One may argue that they never had powerful telescopes or precision instruments like we have, -- but yet we tend to forget that they did not need telescopes or fancy gadgets. They in fact invented their own fancy gadgets, -- gadgets so advanced that we cannot figure out how it was done. Not only did these ancient men live on average 5 times longer than us, their eyesight was probably 100 times better than ours. Besides that, the night sky was far more clearer back in those days.

First, science itself is well into the territory of diminishing returns, and most of the way through the normal life cycle of a human method of investigation. What last week’s post described as abstraction, the form of intellectual activity that seeks to reduce the complexity of experience into a set of precisely formulated generalizations, always depends on such a method. Classical logic is another example, and it’s particularly useful here because it completed its life cycle long ago and so can be studied along its whole trajectory through time.

The Treasury Holdings bid to seek a judicial review of NAMA’s dealings with its loans is set to be resumed in Dublin’s Commercial Courtthis morning at 11am before Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan in Court 14. The case was originally supposed to have concluded last week, and you’ll recall that Treasury was seeking an injunction against the appointment of NAMA’s receivers, and furthermore, a judicial review is being sought of NAMA’s dealings with Treasury’s loans. Treasury abandoned the first of these two strands at the end of last week, so the Court will continue to hear why it should or should grant leave to Treasury to pursue a judicial review.

You claim that Malaysian Muslims have been tolerant living under laws that are not Islamic. Would it surprise you if you were to find out that most Malaysian Muslims, like their fellow countrymen, are more concerned about the content and quality of the laws they live under rather than the labels of these laws? It follows that Malaysians of all backgrounds object to the ISA simply because it is unjust on any view, not because it does not carry an Islamic label. Do not be so presumptuous as to think you are capable of taking the lead to speak for all Muslims in this country.

So it occurred to me after reading the above post from Peter Gray that maybe homeschooling can be considered as a way of child-proofing. After all, isn't putting children into institutional schools and working hard to "train" them to learn about the world with such constraints kind of like putting vases on low bookshelves and then working hard to "train" a toddler to not touch them?
And as for those folks out there quick to jump on this bandwagon against the big, bad government man trying to restrict someone's right to speak, they should think about the fact that their poster child is a fibber, and that she should probably sit in a corner and think about what she did.
