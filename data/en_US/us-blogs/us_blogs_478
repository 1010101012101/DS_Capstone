The ideal is once turning final and setting that initial back cyclic, it's a steady deceleration from 60 to the hover right over the landing spot. Which would mean, a more gentle collective at the end when you translate from flight to hover which would help slow down the helicopter more, which would require forward cyclic to keep from stopping, keeping a more level attitude, less required collective and power and anti-torque at the end.

Remove the tofu, bean spread, dill sour cream, and seaweed caviar from the refrigerator right before serving. Feel free to sprinkle a tiny bit of fine salt onto the tofu at this point. Pipe the bean spread onto the tofu. Top with tiny dollops of sour cream. Sprinkle everything with a small bit of dried dill. Garnish everything with a small spoonful of caviar.

The extensive single player component is incredibly deep with a difficulty curve that is challenging but super satisfying. The track designs in the campaign very quickly go from slightly out-there to nutty as squirrel s@#t with some of the themed levels being particularly insane. The track variety has been greatly helped by the decision to move the game out of the warehouses of Trials HD (which were impressive and are still present) and into a wide selection of gorgeous outdoor environments which add tonne’s of graphical and gameplay variety.

In French, the title is À bout de souffle, which is perhaps more accurately translated as "out of breath." On a literal level, this translation makes sense considering the ennui that eventually befalls its protagonist, Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo); by the end, as he realizes his American lover Patricia (Jean Seberg) has betrayed him, he verbally expresses fatigue, as if he has finally come to the end of his rope in keeping up his lifestyle of bedding girls and stealing cars.

In the beginning, I started out using 2 colors for skin, E00 and E000, and called it a day. Then I discovered that adding a 3rd color, in my case E11, created slightly more depth, so I would start with E11 to create shadows, and then follow with E00 and E000 to blend. Then I discovered that R20 worked well on other areas of skin and not just the traditional cheek color that I had been using it on before. My current method looks like this:

But let’s get back to the man who started it all. Speaking to the press recently about his new release, Covey explained: “Most negotiators are trying to get their way. Through rounds of haggling, they usually arrive at a compromise, in which both sides concede something to get an agreement. By contrast, a third alternative’ requires no concessions at all because it’s truly a better deal for everyone. You get to it not by haggling but by asking, Would you be willing to go for a Third Alternative that is better than what either of us has in mind?’”

The 'closet' wall. Halfway through our painting last week I decided my closet needed a makeover. So, I yanked everything out, painted the interior and installed a closet system. I didn't take a before shot but picture one bar that was too crowded with clothes. It hung too low so my dresses dragged on the floor. All our shoes were kept on the floor but with the dresses dragging, it was hard to get to them. There were 2 shelves above the clothes that were used for 'whatever'. I don't have the doors painted and re-installed but here is the 'after':

Direct instruction is the appropriate teaching method when knowledge acquisition gained through facts, rules, and action sequences is the desired learning outcome (p. 223). Teaching strategies most commonly associated with direct instruction include: daily review of previous day’s work and reteaching when necessary; presenting and structuring new content in small steps; guided student practice with prompts and ample opportunities for student response; feedback and correctives; independent practice; and weekly and monthly review that involves reteaching as needed (p. 225).

Because mtDNA is not highly conserved and has a rapid mutation rate, it is useful for studying the evolutionary relationships-phylogeny of organisms. Biologists can determine and then compare mtDNA sequences among different species and use the comparisons to build an evolutionary tree for the species examined. Because mtDNA is transmitted from mother to child, it can be a useful tool in genealogical research into a person’s maternal line (Song et al., 2005). It is important to remember that mitochondrial populations are considered heteroplasmic. There are many mitochondria within a cell, each with its own mtDNA and potential mutations. Thus when discussing mitochondrial mutations, it is necessary to think of mutations present across the entire mitochondrial population, rather than in a single mitochondrion (Taylor & Turnbull, 2005). Regardless of this unique feature, mothers can have mitochondrial populations that are homoplasmic for a given mitochondrial mutation; in this case, the majority of their mitochondrial genome would harbor the mutation (Taylor & Turnbull, 2005).

Birdsville Track was rutted and rough after no doubt suffering the same rain we had run into a week ago. We stopped to camp at the Mirra Mitta Bore almost exactly half way up the track, after taking a punt that there would be a few trees (or bushes) to shelter us from the gibber stones and the wind. The site was great, with again a hot artesian bore spewing out near boiling water that trickled down alongside our camp, supplying us with hot water. We fended off a few curious travellers the next morning and stayed on in our little desert paradise for another night or two.
I also designed a new weekly spelling homework form for those children that were struggling to complete the monthly tic-tac-toe form. It isn't as cute or creative, but I think it will be easier for many of the children and for busy families - and checking to make sure everything has been completed should be easier too.
We took careful consideration when creating the event's ambiance: Asian-themed accessories were placed throughout the space including fans, sculptures, natural elements, catalogues, and items that Barbara cited as being inspiration for the collection. We lit candles from Barbara Barry's own line and played traditional music in the background. We also had Mrs. Barry's official video about the collection playing for guests to hear about the line from the designer herself. While there were punches of rich tones of fig and charcoal, the palette remained soft and muted so as not to stray far from the look we have all grown to know and love from Barbara Barry, it blends in perfectly with her very first books yet is still very new and unique.

Most of us relying on our backyard gardens for vegetables are probably getting sick of the cole crops. Cole crops, or the Brassica genus, include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, mustard and brussels sprouts. They do great over winter, even in places that get an occasional dusting of snow. Aside from chard, it’s about all that’s harvestable for us right now. I am patiently waiting for peas.
I’m mentioning this now, because the reason we traveled to the Netherlands after Paris was to watch him skate in this year’s speed skating World Single Distance Championships, in Heerenveen. This meet is the equivalent of the Olympics during non-Olympic years; and every 4th year, the Olympics replaces the WSDCs. The only differences are 1) that during Olympic years, the winners receive the “Olympic Champion” title, while during non-Olympic years, a winner is called “World Champion”; and 2) the races during the Olympics are spread out over 2 weeks, so you never have to skate more than one race every other day, while the entire WSDC occurs in 4 consecutive days.

I've been busy the last couple of days. Making and painting. I've been fighting a headache on and off since Monday morning, so I gave up on housework and when it subsided in the afternoons I decided to do something fun rather than cleaning. And I have a good reason to get moving on the creative front, I've committed to this Art Expo in a month, so need to get some smaller works done for my booth/stall. I've never had an art stall before, so this will be a learning experience. I'm keeping expectations fairly low, I hope I can cover my costs and learn some useful things about running a stall, and anything on top of that will be icing on the cake.

After this glorious start, things went downhill very fast and every time a mistake was made, the lawyers threw my firm under the bus and drove over us a few times. At the time, I worked for the largest accounting firm in the world, so, regardless of me, the firm was no slouch. In a few weeks it got to the point, that we resigned from one of the working on one of the largest bankruptcies ever filed.

Now I know that, in an existential sense, life itself -- Big Life -- is just one long perpetual state of incompletion. I get that. But creative projects are not so much Big Life as they are life's brain-children. Heart-children. Soul-children. They have a gestation period, and then they need to be birthed. And the ones that just get transferred from one year's "stuff I want to do" list to the next tend to drain off the very life force that's needed to get them out into the world.

The most insidious part of this is how self-perpetuating it really is, and this is where the struggle for feminists gets hardest. We’re intent on consciousness raising, which is an essential part of getting the ball rolling, but once you’ve had that aha! moment, and see the world for the sexist morass it really is, you also see exactly how hard it is to pull oneself out of that muck. It’s not enough to know that the cosmetic and fashion industries are run by morally bankrupt cretins who don’t care if women die trying to be perfectly pretty. You’re not fighting against just them. You can’t just boycott their products and hope to have a normal life. Their messages have been so pervasive for so long that they’ve become cultural standards well outside of their marketing efforts, which means one not only has to defy those industries–seemingly easy enough–but defy everyone else in your culture who has bought what they’re selling.
Smack then pointed out a few barrels in the corner wrapped in plastic that had been delivered. You guessed it, bourbon barrels. For their Dark Hollow release, they age an Imperial Stout (that uses English Crystal and Chocolate malt) in these charred oak barrels for 100 days to impart that bourbony goodness into the beer. The sample we enjoyed was aged in Jim Beam barrels, but for next year's batch they had Wild Turkey barrels being filled that very day. The Beam barrel-aged bottles were still a new release, having just come out on Friday, so Steve and I grabbed a couple bottles each on the way out.

Life is not a video game, we can't just punch RESTART when we mess up. This is it. This is our chance on this planet. We are an eyeblink of the gods. The dinosaurs, who always seemed such a big failure to me, were dominant for millions of years. We as a species are not going to last that long because as a society we have lost sight of what is important. We have become too big for our britches. We have huge cities filled with people who don't know carrots grow in the ground. What would happen if another asteriod hit? Can you imagine the armegeddon? Agribusiness no more, food - planting, growing, preserving, storing becomes our way of life again. If we haven't poisoned our planet so much that it is too late.

What bothered me was that in the end, I don’t think Austin got it. He openly hated Carrie’s job and spent the majority of the novella waiting for her to come to her senses and come home. While the do eventually reconcile and “compromise” it’s not in any way I see working in the long run. I wondered if maybe Carrie should have given the big city boys a chance…because Austin’s not giving up anything for her dream.
At the top it was finally time to descend and descend we did!!! I noticed at this time I was getting passed by a few runners as we headed down a beautiful stretch of trail at the top of the world!! Here I thought I was a good down hill runner but apparently not as good as I thought. With the fatigue of 30 miles already on my legs I was braking too much down this stretch. Some runners from the area passed and told me to get use to the down hill. They said "Plan on the next 2 hours of being all down hill".

The action of the play, such at it is, is an artist's dream assignment. The time is the late 50s. Rothko has been hired to paint a series of murals that will be installed in the Four Seasons restaurant in the Seagram's Building in NYC. This is a real event in the life of the real Mark Rothko. And a number of questions swirl around this - whether this is selling out, what is the purpose of art, or of modern art and what the purpose of the art in a public space should be.

It's something you've never even heard of when you first set out on that path of ridiculous dreams otherwise known as WRITING A NOVEL. When you are finally let in on the scary little secret, it's a word that strikes fear in the writer's heart.

And Reagan, for what it’s worth, really really does not come across well in Drift.

Numbers. They can tell us important information, but they don’t lend comprehension to everything. There’s no possible way to know that the number values we assign to some things have any meaning at all. This is most blatantly true when it comes to natural resources. Capitalism dictates that natural resources should be assigned a monetary value and thus exploited for profit. Would you drain your own blood and sell it if someone offered you a small fortune for it? Somehow, we don’t realize that this is exactly what we do when we privatize natural resources. The fact that we think it’s acceptable – and desirable – to do so tells us everything we need to know about where we’re headed.

The heavy snow rained down on the windows of my already over-frosted pickup, the wipers barely able to sweep away the avalanche of ice which constantly pelted them. As I strained to see past the layer of thick frost on the front window of my truck, I thought about why I was speeding down a mountain sierra road in northern California in a snowstorm. I hadn’t meant to come this far; my little trek had only been a day-trip to one of the many small, secluded lakes that sat amongst the hills and forests surrounding Mariposa, the little mountain town that I now drove through. I had spent all day wandering through the trees, as I often did when I made my self-named “little treks” up to these mountains. I had admired the majesty of the tall Sequoias that stretched up to the clouded December sky. All around me, fresh banks of snow warned of the imminent possibility of another snowfall, but I did not heed them and continued to explore the forest. I remembered stopping and examining a patch of lichen which enveloped a rock that protruded from one of the snow banks. It had been a carefree afternoon, one where I had just let my mind wander all day, just as I had wandered through the forest.

Since I have been prospecting new clients, how I appear on the web has become of the utmost importance to me, and I’m sure also for those searching my name. To start on a positive note, since I’ve been so busy helping others with their growth initiatives, I’ve had little time to be concerned with mine. I have a stockpile of great new portfolio meat to add to my repertoire, and my website intro video was outdated stating silly things like “Make an Impact in 2010″. Sheesh, we all know that digital years, like dog years, have an exponential age variance. So, needless to say I had work to do and things to update. To start my self discovery, just like the rest of the world’s introspective visionaries, I Googled myself and despite how it sounds, it’s completely legal to do in public.
Tottenham into the River Lee/Lea. Enfield Chase has its own station which marks the beginning of Enfield Town: the High Street remains pretty traditional complete with Thursday Market Day and war memorial. It also still has an independent Department Store today, in honour of Christmas, sporting a huge red bow (which from the top deck of the bus looked rather like a giant bosom). The town itself also had its own fairly modest Christmas tree, of the everlasting variety. In spite of the town being busy we swept through and noted that the New River looked much much cleaner than on our previous trips through Enfield, either by design or the autumn death of duck weed?

I first read Coraline what feels like years ago... oh wait, that's because it was. The simplicity of the tale and the evil of the Other Mother captured me in a way that good storytelling does. After the movie I was almost resistant to re-read it. The movie took the simplicity of the book and made it muddled and colorful and Disney. And above all else, NOT BRITISH. Sure, they tried to appease me with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, but too little too late. The visuals might have been wonderful, but it lacked the impact of the book. Aside from moving the story to the West Coast of the United States, the movie felt obliged, in typical movie fashion, to add a little sidekick for Coraline with Wybie. All these superfluous visuals and characters took away from the core story and made it more about spectacle. When I picked up the book again, all these negative feelings about the film kept barging in on my reading. At first I couldn't separate the two and it made me resent to film. Like how, sometimes, now when you're reading Harry Potter you can't help but picture Daniel Radcliffe, the film was tainting my reading.

Though Park attempted to restrict Yaya Toure’s movements, ultimately this game played out similarly to United’s loss at Newcastle earlier in the year. It isn’t easy to have more of the ball than a team with two quality passers in Carrick and Scholes but on both occasions United saw less of the ball and were significantly overrun centrally. The loss at Newcastle showed how over-indulgent United had been by using the languid Dimitar Berbatov with the Scholes and Carrick axis and it’s little coincidence that he started just one game after that defeat.

China is continuing to provide advanced missiles and other conventional arms to Iran and may be doing so in violation of U.N. sanctions against the Tehran regime, according to a draft report by the congressional U.S.-China Commission. “China continues to provide Iran with what could be considered advanced conventional weapons,” the report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission says. According to the report, which will be made public Nov. 16, China sold $312 million worth of arms to Iran, second only to Russia, after Congress passed the Iran Freedom Support Act in 2006 that allows the U.S. government to sanction foreign companies that provide advanced arms to Iran. The report also noted that, after Russia began cutting back arms transfers to Iran in 2008, China became the largest arms supplier to the Iranian military. Most of the weapons transfers involved sales of Chinese anti-ship cruise missiles, including C-802 missiles that China promised the United States in 1997 would not be exported to Iran. China also built an entire missile plant in Iran last year to produce the Nasr-1 anti-ship cruise missile.

My friends are much better people than this. The people I choose to surround myself with are supportive, considerate, trustworthy, honest and kind. My trainer for instance, a terrific person who has been crapped on several times in her life. Someone burglarized her barn, not just once, but twice! This woman doesn't have a palace, and works so hard for what she has. Why should she be the person to lose so much? I often ask God that question. His answer? He doesn't always give us what we WANT, but he ALWAYS gives us what we NEED. I don't know the how or the why of my trainer needing to be burglarized twice, but God has the plan, I need the faith to follow what his plan is for me and my friends. I do pray, and I include my trainer in my prayers.

Then the external dance ends and there you are in stillness yet again, savouring the dance that goes on inside you. A long exhalation and you just let go. You close your eyes and just feel the beating of your heart. For the first time in a long time you are just aware of how your body feels. Aware of where cloth touches skin and skin touches floor. Aware of the air against your skin. And your body, ready to ignite and take flight. Knowing that at this moment, you have everything that you need. You were dancing in the dark, and now you have landed in the light.
I get up and, while my husband handles everything in the kitchen (lunches, dishes, breakfast prep), I get the kids mostly dressed and to the table. Take the kids to daycare, go to work – immensely distracting, very intense, takes lots of energy, pick kids up and start to wind down, juggle the afternoon kid mood with getting dinner made, while trying to get a few moments with them either outside or on the floor, sillies before bed, time on the couch to be in the same room as my husband, bed too late.

Every time I walked from the water back to my beach towel, or along the beach, all I could see was little pieces of plastic! It was everywhere!

I like to savor them, think about them, but I don't always follow through. I have collected a bunch of non-fiction books that I have not read or finished. So this year, I plan to read more non-fiction. I will read and focus on one each month (still leaving time for more fiction love). Here are 6 I have found to start the first half of the year:

But hey, after listening to these three recent Atlantics exhumations that were released via the Something Hot Communications label (and available via CD Baby) I've gotta admit that these Bostonians were just the right mix of pop and hard rock to almost (operative word) punk (and even metal!), and the combination makes me wanna go and search out the group's own late-seventies big label release that most definitely got lost under the tide of a whole load of subpar sputum. Aural visions of weep wimp sounds got quickly flushed outta my system with these disques that prove hometown Boston certainly did have a life outside of the perennial Velvet Underground worship that it banked its rock 'n roll image on in the seventies. Not quite Raspberries or Cheap Trick, but still hotcha enough with potential AM weirdities like "Pop Shivers", "Lonelyhearts" and "Television Girl" that, in another world, might have broken outta the local scene ghetto and onto national acceptance, but frankly the kids were too album-oriented braindead to catch on. These guys might've been the best pop group to have come outta Boston since the Sidewinders, and they certainly were tough enough to match that hallowed act in the teenage potential top 40 outta nowhere hit department.

And a month later the public learns of the coverup attempt, thanks to the Ottawa Citizen. Fortunately, RackNine’s Meier has fingered a man at a Rogers IP address, potentially because of a cookie associated with both Poutine/Jones’ account, and a legitimate account. This man is allegedly (according to Brian LaRue) Andrew Prescott, who had a legit account at RackNine. So while the coverup at CPC headquarters may momentarily save the conspirator(s) located there, it cannot save Pierre Poutine, because the suspect list is very narrow. There are not many people at the CPC Guelph campaign who can be blamed for not submitting ANY RackNine expense claims, and it’s down to Prescott’s word against the campaign manager and accountant’s words about why the legit RackNine expenses did not get submitted to EC. Also on the hook in Ottawa will be system administrators who could have modified the CIMS database records.

Backstory: OK, so if you read Betty’s recipe, it explicitly states to use a 13×9 pan that is NOT dark or non-stick. So of course dark and non-stick are the only baking pans I have. So I got some of those disposable aluminum pans. Yeah, they had one that said on it “13×9 baking pan,” but I bought the cake pan with the lid because I figured that I would take the leftovers to work on Monday. The lid would be key for transportation! Well, this was a mistake. I knew it as soon as I poured both the cake and pudding mixtures into the pan.

Once, at a Kinkos in New York, I wanted some copies made. The girl behind the counter was so rude that I questioned myself for a minute. I thought, Wait, I have not walked into a Kinkos at all. Clearly this was some parallel universe – for this was Mcdonalds drive through, truck stop, kind of talk. There the employees take more liberties. They think, “I can say what I want to this d-bag. I’ll never see her again, unless she’s coming up the 95 again at exactly 2pm on a Sunday.” Yes, clearly this was Whores R’ Us and not sweet, listen to the sound of the humming copiers and relax, Kinkos because I knew for sure I was being served a d*ck sandwich. Right in the face, by this rude lady, who clearly just got out of jail. And I don’t care if you just got out of jail. Hell, everyone needs to work. What you don’t need to do is spew your jail rage on me while I’m trying to make a feckin’ copy order. I don’t spew my jail rage on you – I do it where it’s appropriate – like here, on this blog.

We wish Genelia all the happiness for her married life as well as success for her movie which released this Friday. Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya is the story of Viren (Riteish Deshmukh) a rickshaw driver who works very hard to earn his livings. Mini (Genelia D’souza), on the other hand, is a rich brat who her father is trying to get married off but none of the suitors seem to please her. In a chance of fate, an accidently kidnapping ensues where the so-called kidnapper may actually be the one kidnapped. What loves is a sweet story between these two.

I know you will enjoy reading these three posts by fellow bloggers Qusay, Nidal M, and Layla, who explain in detail about weddings in Saudi Arabia. Men and women in Saudi Arabia generally have gender segregated weddings, with separate events for men and women. Unfortunately you will never see what the woman's side of the wedding ever looks like. While Saudi women dress to the nines when they attend weddings, cameras are generally not allowed because the women inside are not properly covered. But trust me, the Saudi women go all out with expensive sexy ballgowns, heavy makeup, and glittering shoes and jewelry.

Little kids, however, are still learning to navigate the maze of feelings they have and are developing their own ways for dealing with all of those big feelings. As a child, being angry, sad, or discouraged, can feel entirely overwhelming. As adults, one of the most important tasks we have is to teach children how to deal with all of the big feelings that they are having. They also cannot always verbalize how they are feeling. Imagine feeling as though you are being sucked into a tornado of emotion and not being able to reach out to an adult for help, because the only way you can think to reach out for help or attention, misbehaving, alienates the adult.

I certainly agree that it definitively shows that the earth becomes God’s domain, but I fail to see where it would specifically identify where the holy ones themselves would be ruling from, since the holy ones are not mentioned specifically in that vision. That’s why I say that this particular prophecy, without a guidepost to direct our interpretation of “kingdom”, does not settle for us the issue of where the holy ones will rule from. Naturally, the kingdom is partite, as you are using the word, for it will eternally involve both heaven and earth. The only real question is from “where do the holy ones reign”.

Last month, I hit the 6 month mark of my internship, which means I'm halfway done. 6 months down, 6 months to go. The experience so far has been a combination of wonderful, hard, exhausting, and rewarding. There are days I feel like I'm on top of the world, and there are days I wonder, can I make it to Friday? The past 6 months have truly felt like a journey. In many ways, its hard for me to believe its only been 6 months; it feels like so much longer. Part of that, I think, is due to the fact that its the homestretch of this 6 year degree. I often hear marathon runners talk about the last few miles being the hardest, and though I'm far from a marathon runner, (understatement, I can't even run a mile), this Ph.D has been nothing short of a grueling race, filled with doubt, excitement, success, and detours. But these last few miles have been filled with their own challenges, their own successes, and their own lessons. So I thought I'd take a second to share a few of the biggest lessons I've learned during the past 6 months.

I have been trying to look ahead to shows for the upcoming Fall and Christmas seasons.I really need to find some good shows to do but I am having very little luck.I have found a couple of local shows that I plan to get in on but I would like to find some more.I really need your help please.If you know of any good shows in the NC/SC area would you please let me know.You can either leave me a comment or you can email me tammywellman14@yahoo.com and please put shows in the subject.I know things are still not back to normal with the economy but I am hoping that things will soon start to look better.Well I will go for now and get ready for my favorite show The Biggest Loser.Thanks so much for any help you can give me.Have a nice night!

Good thing I took this plum tree flower as we were heading out for the walk instead of waiting until we returned. Blue sky here now, but when we got back, it was all cloudy.
The Apostle Paul is addressing a great crowd of Jews in Jerusalem. He is recounting his religious life showing that it brought him condemnation rather than salvation. According to Galatians 1:14 he “profited in the Jews religion…being more exceedingly zealous of the tradition of the fathers.” What was the result of it? He was blinded.
~ In a fit of extravagance I don't normally allow myself, I bought myself another pair of shoes that I'm waiting for to be delivered. They're so me there was no way I could pass them up. Wait til you see them!
Often, an erection is achieved through mental stimulation. Impulses from the brain to a state of relaxation that allows blood to flow into the penis. Blood flow leads to an accumulation of pressure, which in turn, expands the penis. The blood is caught and gets an erection. If the muscles in the penis to relax, blood flows from the penis and the erection disappears.
he suffered, died, and was buried.
Can't wait to work on some other projects and to share more of the fun things I have learned with you:)
Apparently, we do not have enough money to feed all. Food subsidy will increase budget deficit. We probably might end up luring people not to work with this kind of subsidy. Also, we should target specific deprived groups. We should make it universal and end India’s target group politics. Only 10p of every rupee will reach the poor, so what’s the point? We should check if we have adequate resources. How can we procure enormous quantity of food grain?
We'd love to see something yummy on your creation.

“I was very happy with the direction we were taking and we got some good data from the car. The developments we have here are a definite step forward and I think because of our programme there was quite a lot more to come from the package.”
Mr. Campbell’s descriptions of executions are suitably grim, though he also takes a look on the bright side. While the Middle Ages were especially rough times for the accused, they were plush times for a certain type of entrepreneur. Witch-hunter Matthew Hopkins made a killing in the trade in the mid-1600s, earning 20 shillings per conviction (a month’s wages for a laborer). On one red-letter day he sent 19 witches to their deaths. Impoverished towns might spend a big portion of their budgets on witch extermination. This was not an exact science. The famous “swimming” test bound witches and lowered them in water. If they floated, they were guilty. If they drowned, they were innocent. (Sorry—we meant well!)
he's fine, now...but it's been hectic...you can't make up shit like this...
The light changes. It goes brighter sometimes, as though it is attempting to break into the window, but fails miserably. Like a pulsating light that glimmers for a fraction of a second, barely noticeable. The illusion of pulses are probably caused by a cloud that blocked the sun’s rays, and then left, letting the light shine brighter, and then was replaced by another cloud that decided to park itself there above the sky, in front of the sun, and didn’t care that I am not getting enough sunlight through my window.

…We stop. M commences to get out of his kayak (borrowed from his work friend (smaller gentleman than M (not hard to do) also, triple parenthesis for thought within a thought within a thought…I do what I Want! hehe) who’d brought it along) and starts trying to dump out the water. Eventually, I realize I should probably get myself out into the mucky water to help with this charade, so we each take a handle and turn the sucker over. Out gushes a couple litres of water! Apparently at 6’4″ and undisclosed weight, M was a little big for the boat. End kayaking.
Duane Ensing - Coming out of University with a BFA in Visual Arts has impacted the way I see the world and has allowed me to challenge and explore the limits of design we see everyday. I love architecture and working with it in the landscape to create a permanence that it can bring. Architects like Tadao Ando and Santiago Calatrava to name a couple, move beyond the traditional, but keep the simplicity and effectiveness of the design to the table. I like that, and aim to develop spaces and sculpt the landscape to work together in a cohesive design.

Seeing this painting on display at UT’s Blanton Museum of Art stopped me in my tracks: Simeon! How long did he wait until that promised day? What obstacles did he face during those intervening years?
Values: Beliefs that are shared among the stakeholders of an organization. Values drive an organization's culture and priorities and provide a framework in which decisions are made. For example, "Knowledge and skills are the keys to success" or "give a man bread and feed him for a day, but teach him to farm and feed him for life". These example values may set the priorities of self sufficiency over shelter."

“The fact that our programs had gotten it right — and we had the data to prove it — didn’t keep us from destroying that model,” she said.
And for fun, here is the back cover copy Ballantine created for the book:
Such predicaments reveal the battle between rationality/human agency and irrationality in the soul of the African. The African appears helpless under this bizarre battle. There are two possibilities: 1. The believer in witchcraft does not question why witchcraft is responsible for life’s tribulations. 2. The witchcraft believer acts under not only the cultural circumstances but also his or her human agency. In such frame of mind, the witchcraft believer is guilty of atrocities committed against victims of witchcraft accusation and not witches influencing circumstances.
"Just holding on." I lied. You see, I was perched on the back of a sleek, red Ducati for the first time. Well sort of. The performance motorcycle isn't really built for two. See that aerodynamic fender type thing behind the driver's seat, about 6 inches up-- that was where my rump was supposed to plant. But as a short woman with a short ratio waist to shoulder, I had no chance.
In the middle of the show, I was thinking how we haven’t seen the Blizzard Man in a while. Then lo and behold. I should have realized he could be appearing, what with Diddy as the musical guest. It would be great to see him again in two weeks with Eminem and Lil Wayne. De Niro in drag as Blizzy’s moms and Diddy hitting on her was too freaky for words. The MC Skat Kat was the nicest touch. B

Andrew Brannon was born in London and grew interested in racing when at school in Chester, watching the action at the local course from the city walls. He has owned horses for six or seven years and was involved in the Highclere Thoroughbred Racing partnership that won the 2008 King George V Handicap at Royal Ascot with Colony. He and Weird Al’s co-owners could have an exciting day on Saturday as they are also set to be represented by the Donald McCain- trained Super Duty in the John Smith’s Mersey Novices’ Hurdle. Their other horses with McCain include this season’s Grade One Finale Juvenile Hurdle winner Hollow Tree while Brannon additionally has a half-share in a horse with Tim Easterby and plans to get another inmate with Newmarket handler John Berry, from whom his hurdler Dr Darcey was recently claimed. Brannon is a chartered accountant and licensed insolvency practitioner who co-founded the LCL Group, a specialist provider of insurance and reinsurance services. He started the company with one of Weird Al’s co-owners, Philip Holden, a lawyer now based in Manchester. The third partner is Andrew Dick, who is also based in Manchester and co-founded Begbies Taylor, Britain’s biggest independent corporate rescue and recovery specialists. They named their John Smith’s Grand National contender after Weird Al Yankovic, the American singer famous for parodying other people’s songs. The connection came from the fact that Yankovic is a good accordion player and Weird Al is by the stallion Accordion.
I don't know what I liked so much about The Rocky Horror Picture Show; it just struck a chord. I was always a big fan of musicals and weirdos, and I was vaguely familiar with the work of Meatloaf, so I guess it was right up my alley. "My alley" is apparently one of those dark, tawdry alleys behind a gay bar.
Well, you say, of course they are mainly white, after all 76% of the people in America are white. If we are going to use statistics then that means that 24% of Americans are not white. How many policy making bodies are 24% of color? And to expand the discussion a bit, how many of them are more than 50% female, which would be representative of gender demographics?
Episode four of Shoreline screened on 3 August 2009, was supposed to cover the coastal area between Yzerfontein and Robben Island. Yep, you guessed it! They got stuck for nearly 45 minutes on Robben Island where Ol’ Mandela was kept prisoner. How many more times must the citizens of this country be reminded about the major role Robben Island has played in our country’s history as a place of exile, isolation and imprisonment for the poor black souls?
Tori was very specific about how things were going to roll.
As would be expected, there are quite a few towns named after founding fathers. The names of foreign countries are popular, as well. Foreign cities are well represented in the names of Ohio towns. I’m not sure if I can include Lima with that group, since I can’t state with certainty whether it was named after the city in Peru or the bean.

With plans of a pull out starting as early as next year, this may not be the first strategic mistake the US had made in this war, but it could yet prove the costliest. The short-term response is not as troubling as the long-term implications. The closure of NATO supply lines will make Barack Obama more dependent on Vladimir Putin's goodwill, and the northern supply route through which 60% of troops and military cargo to Afghanistan now travel. But, of itself, the closures will be a temporary problem. Of greater significance is the erosion of Pakistani public support for the US fight against the Taliban. Images of the funerals of the young martyrs filled television screens across Pakistan on Sunday and protests against the attack were held throughout the country. “Imagine how we would feel if it had been 24 American soldiers killed by Pakistani forces at this moment,” Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat from Illinois, said on Fox News Sunday.
"At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon." In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics (and I just love this part):
Most backbenchers have the interests of their party high on their agenda but at the same time they elevate the issues they care about highly too, and are not afraid to speak out in public as well as behind the scenes. Loyalty is a two-way process which requires being recognised for talents. As I remain a role-less backbencher in the civic centre I must define for myself what and how I make a contribution to the borough.

The apostle writes of such a situation in Romans 7:24. “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” There is only one answer and one hope and we see it in the next verse, Romans 7:25. “I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” It is for this very same purpose Christ Jesus came into the world. In John 8:36 He said, “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”
It's how I feel each time I go to my favorite municipal park and see families holding hands and swinging arms as they walk to the playground or circumnavigate the pond to feed the ducks and fish. I smile as I see fathers pull up for a quick lunch-time picnic with their wives and kids before heading back to the office. I can't explain the joy it gives me except to describe it as hope. It's normal. It's traditional. It's beautiful.
What is incredibly disappointing to low-income families in Washington, D.C. has been the silence of President Barack Obama. The President, who benefited from K-12 scholarships himself, worked on behalf of low-income families in Chicago, and exercises school choice as a parent, has stood silently on the sidelines while his Secretary of Education belittled the importance of helping such a small number of children in the nation’s capital.”

For many young college athletes this is the ultimate dream, becoming the #1 pick in the NFL draft. While only one reaches that dream, many collegiate players fall short of ultimately reaching the NFL. This year there are 253 picks in total between the 32 NFL teams. While thousands play collegiate football only the top 10 percent or so go to play on professionally.

I made three similar cards for friends at work using my new Tim Holtz Rosette Die. Soooooo much easier than scoring every 1/4" for 12" by hand and folding! The die cuts and pre-scores all of the segments. Again, very easy to use.
Historical fiction had a strong showing in those novels shortlisted for this year's Booker Prize, but again, as we saw yesterday, literary prizes aren't the surest way of increasing sales. Suffice it to say that historical fiction is doing well across the board, both in terms of reviews and sales.

My simple and immediate answer was that I wasn’t well enough to go. My immune system seemed severely compromised and I felt unwilling to risk my health. However, with my belief system, I was determined to look at the bigger picture.
Life is grand, things are good. As for memoirs of what to expect prior to taking the plunge into a new country, all I can say is just dive right in and deal with what comes your way with an open mind. I believe that is the path to happiness – Over thinking never was a friend of mine.
His surgery was not long at all. The poor receptionist felt horrible with how upset I was. When they called and told her to bring me into a room because the surgery was over she actually went back to make sure so I didn't get upset again for no reason. She was so sweet.
In his new book Cities Under Siege, published just two weeks ago, geographer Stephen Graham explores "the extension of military ideas of tracking, identification and targeting into the quotidian spaces and circulations of everyday life," including "dramatic attempts to translate long-standing military dreams of high-tech omniscience and rationality into the governance of urban civil society." This is just part of a "deepening crossover between urbanism and militarism," one that will only become more pronounced, Graham fears, over time.

All one has to do to find out some of the crazy things I did is check out my senior page in my yearbook. There's the photo of me and my friends alongside 'Bob', the old man that drove around the Wal-Mart parking lot in a golf car as a security officer. We made friends with him (hey. There wasn't exactly a lot to do in the small town, all right?) and he used to let us go for rides.

We now understand that our pineal glands actually may calcify over time. This strongly inhibits our ability. To my knowledge, this was first thought of as an inevitable part of aging. However, there’s loads of evidence that shows diet plays a huge role in calcifying and even de-calcifying our pineal glands. A child is born into the world without already having eaten years and years of processed foods. This is another big part of what gives them the one up on us grown-ups in the psychic department. Their communication equipment is cleaner. Aluminum is a big pineal gland destroyer. And aluminum can be found in most drinking water, vaccinations, cook-ware, deodorant, food containers and many processed foods and spices including tortillas, breads, chips, and baking powder. There have been studies linking aluminum cookware to Alzheimer’s, and for good reason. Even my son Dougie, the amazing psychic, has been tested to prove overload of aluminum in his system. This was years ago, while he was still going through major healing from autism related illness.

It's interesting, too, that he points out the often suburban concerns of the 'great' male American novel, since the general perception is that 'suburban' is one of the sub-characteristics for which women's literature is deemed generally lesser.

I dont often post material from MotoGP, I leave that to my colleague Neil Spalding (@Spalders). However every year Yamaha kindly provide a technical review of their bike. With this year being the last of the 800cc regulations, the analysis is that bit more poignant. The Press pack which I received is presented at by Kouichi Tsuji the YZR-M1 Project Leader at last race of the year. So while I lack the background that Tsuji-san provided in Valencia, there are some interesting sections related to aero in the slide pack.
We had issues with the chickens eating their eggs at first, yikes! I asked folks over on TBUH and decided to take the advice of putting fake eggs in the nesting boxes, and it worked thank goodness.
The most popular books appear to depend primarily on “WOM,” or word-of-mouth: how to capture it remains elusive to most working in the industry. (I’ll talk about some of my theories on WOM on my forthcoming blog at www.lucindaliterary.com.) WOM is the oldest tradition in an even older tradition: readers still talk about books. With online, we’re only talking about them more loudly, and to a far larger universe than our mothers and close friends. I don’t call the WOM phenomenon publicity: I call it straight up marketing.
In an 8-quart stockpot over medium heat, saute the onions and garlic with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the butter, and red pepper flakes for 10 minutes, until the onions start to brown. Add the canned tomatoes, basil, thyme, and chicken stock. Add the oven-roasted tomatoes, including the liquid on the baking sheet. *Pop the roasted garlic cloves out of the skin and add to the soup. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered for 40 minutes. Pass through a food mill fitted with the coarsest blade. Taste for seasonings. Serve hot or cold.

If I keep going, past the Museum and across a bridge, I find myself in an oasis of serenity, an island set in small lagoons, graced by a Japanese Garden, the island also a remnant of that fair. A bit more of a walk, and I come upon a golden woman, “The Republic”, a replica of a larger statue that stood at the gateway Court of Honor. And just to the west is a long park for strolling, ice skating in winter, listening to jazz in the summer, the Midway Plaisance, which, during the Exposition, was a focal point of carnival-style entertainments.

Two young men in their twenties who spoke about their lives and loves – they had those police officers eating out of the palm of their hands and listening attentively by the simple expedient of basing their simple message about equality and respect around anecdotes involving football and pubs, girls and sex. It was perfectly pitched to be funny without being inappropriate and it broke down barriers and superbly challenged assumptions and probably prejudice.
In the mean time, dissolve the Sazon Goya packets in the cup of water and add the remaining lemon juice. Add the tomatoes to the rice cooker along with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the chicken stock and Sazon Goya water. If the reserved tomato liquid is less than 3/4 cups, add enough water or chicken stock to bring it up to 3/4. Add to the rice cooker and stir to combine. Add the chicken to the rice, stir. Close the lid and set the rice cooker to full cycle (if it has gone into Keep Warm mode). Approximately 10 minutes into the cooking, very quickly open the lid and add the frozen peas. Close and let it finish the cycle.

Again, nicely organized on shoe stands, easy to find exactly what I am looking for! I typically keep my slip on and go shoes by the front door, and my dressier options in my bedroom closet. And to ensure my boots stay in tip top shape, I just roll up an old magazine and stick it inside!
I love post apocalyptic movies, and I am not sure why. The entire premise involves the destruction of life as we know it and the decimation of the human race….wait, maybe that’s it. The theme invokes a fantasy of solitude that we can never truly reach and also offers a do-over for the mistakes that the human race has made. Many of us are fascinated by this genre, and it just occurred to me that it could be because of a hidden message. Post apocalyptic movies are not just about the end but also about a new beginning. They can also be classified as futuristic westerns (which is my other favorite genre) since they inherently create a new frontier.
“I’ve got so much material about that time and place and there are many more interesting places the character can go,” he says. “I’d love to get him in some kind of confrontation with the Thatcher government, for example, or get mixed up in the DeLorean disaster, or any number of things. And of course, musically, we’ll eventually have to get to his difficult ‘New Romantic’ years …” THE COLD COLD GROUND by Adrian McKinty is published by Serpent’s Tail.
According to U.S. and Saudi officials, some individuals and multilateral charitable organizations have allegedly increased their use of more informal financial transaction methods, such as couriering cash across borders, in response to Saudi Arabia’s adoption of regulations making transactions in the formal financial sector more challenging. Though Saudi Arabia has implemented cash courier regulations, Saudi officials noted that motivated individuals can circumvent such regulations by moving amounts of cash that are below legal declaration limits. U.S. officials concurred, noting circumvention of regulations as an inherent challenge in regulating the use of cash couriers in any country. U.S. and Saudi officials also cited the prevalent use of cash for transactions as a challenge, particularly in Saudi Arabia. According to these officials, because large numbers of people in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region use cash, an individual traveling with or declaring large amounts of cash may not raise suspicion. Moreover, challenges associated with preventing the circumvention of cash courier regulations increase during hajj, which, despite efforts by the Saudi government, presents logistical enforcement challenges because of the large number of people involved.

The incident occurred on Friday as a family was passing through a security checkpoint, TSA officials say. A mother with a baby walked through a metal detector when the machine sounded an alarm.

I'm not trying to be mysterious, but, seriously, if I had to go into all the boring details, this blog post would run to hundreds of pages!! Apart from various other happenings, we have had fears for our business(livelihood!) which have suddenly been reprieved, maybe temporarily, or maybe we are on an upward trend again? These really are uncertain times, everywhere, I think. Having also taken on extra work, things are now very very hectic indeed..Life is rather strange, but nothing that can't be handled!

But notice that as you count all you are doing is adding another ONE to the first one. Then to get to number three you must add 2 more ONES to the first one. To get number four (0nes)you must now add THREE more ones to make four (ones) and so on. It is all about adding ones together. But a million ones will never make a million per se. It is in truth a million ONES.

More than R20 billion spent by national and provincial departments has been found to have been unauthorised, irregular, wasteful and fruitless expenditure.
Before I begin to address my main thought today, I just want to refer to a few scriptures to affirm the fact that the idea of living a contented life is completely Biblical. Turn in your Bibles to I Timothy 6:6-8 “Godliness with contentment is great gain; for we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.”

Schellenbach and Berry would leave the band, though and Adam “Ad-Rock” Horowitz, a third middle-class Jewish kid from New York, came on board.
At the same time, I had immense passion for Cricket and would bunk school for cricket, let it be playing or watching. Being a lefty, I literally worshipped Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly and so on. But I didn’t channelize my passion for cricket in a proper way so the voice within faded away with time. I had passion for WWE too! And was and am still a hardcore fan of Jeff Hardy. But to dream and aim to be a pro-wrestler was stupid I knew and no doubt arouse at that time.
I ended my last blog by saying that if you were good I'd tell you a ghost story. Well, you have been so I will. And it is true. It is, it is.
The irony of missing the call so I could do a post isn’t lost on me lol! Thankfully these calls usually have a recording so I’ll listen tomorrow. I’ve been procrastinating on my blog so decided my intuition was telling me to blog and listen later. I’m a little burned out on teleseminars again, listening to others tell you what you need to know. I’m really realizing I have all I need to know and am learning to trust that now.

Dorothy's unsatisfied with the conversation and threatens to run for against him for mayor. The mayor doesn't believe her, but by the end of the day, Dorothy has enough signatures to allow her name to be on the ballot.
Before my troubles,
Wendy Rosen is a Democrat, running against freshman Republican extremist Andy Harris. Harris has done absolutely nothing to help Maryland’s Eastern Shore during his tenure in the US Congress. Defeating Harris will be an uphill battle, considering that Maryland’s new redistricting map has made the 1st district even more of a Republican leaning district, by adding conservative areas of Harford County and Baltimore County to it’s boundaries. The State Legislature did this to weaken Maryland’s other Republican representative, Roscoe Bartlett, by making his district more Democratic-friendly.
MY COMMENTS:
I tell the control-me that this is what we choose to do from now: Look for chanterelles only and dismiss the poisonous mushrooms – the thoughts of fear and control.
When lost in places far from Clifton and Defence, stop and ask the nearest ricksha wala, "Ji, yeh Nipa Chowrangi kidhar hai?" And if you are really desperate, "Saddar kaunsa road jaata hai, bhaiyya?"
To quote from the article:
It costs £20.50 which is quite costly for a highlighter but believe me, I was totally converted once I used it myself..and it's sold in a lot of online shops and they often have codes flying about the place. If you're hesitant, I'd suggest going to a decent NARS concession (the people on the Selfridges one in London are fantastic) and asking them to apply it on you. Then check it in both indoor and outdoor light to see how you look.

Have you ever had one of those days when it seems the world is crumbling around you? But ah, it is in the eyes of the beholder- because everyone else around me today, at the gas station, in the drugstore... their world's seemed just fine... life proceeding as usual.
How they must envy Freder Fredersen. Born rich. Raised idle. Without a mother from birth, but possessed of every privilege his birthright can provide him. Handsome, athletic, carefree; until one day, when his Edenic frolic is interrupted by a plain-dressed woman with a penetrating stare, flanked by dozens of workers’ children. This is Maria (Brigitte Helm); daughter of a worker. Freder cannot take his eyes off her, and never will be able to again.

The first card is a thank you note that could be used at any time during the year. I let the stamp image (part of Faith in Nature which is a set you can purchase with Hostess Dollars) pick the color palette for the card and was led to this gorgeous paisley print from the Spice Cake DSP. It's colors include Pear Pizazz, River Rock, Very Vanilla, and just a touch of Soft Suede. I colored the pear with Watercolor Wonder Crayons and an Aqua Painter pen. I added a length of 1 1/4" Striped Grosgrain Ribbon in Soft Suede for a little texture and to accent the focal point image. This color of striped ribbon was just added this year and I love it.
The road turned inland again and we said goodbye to the coast as we hit warmer forest air. The road also began to rise again and I got the distinct feeling that we were heading in the right direction and towards the glaciers. Another aspect of the journey I had noticed ever since Lake Taupo on North Island was that the further South we headed, the more everything began to wear its Autumn catalogue. The more South we ventured the thicker it got, from the scattered odd tree up North to tall golden geyser Poplars, frozen by the coming fall. Line after line of them, blazing yellow on each horizon we entered. The world around us had become mottled as it slowly died at the hands of Winters Autumnal brush. Strange to think that we would have two Autumns this year.

After the show, we were just hanging out in the living room, when I started getting cramps very low down, like menstrual cramps. At that point in my pregnancy, everything was pretty creaky and uncomfy, so I just figured, “Ahh, more aches and pains, nothing new here.” As Alex and I chatted, I moaned softly and told him about the cramps, but I was convinced that it was false labor, since my belly wasn't tightening, like my birthing books had said it would. Luckily, Alex wisely ignored me and started timing my contractions. They were five minutes apart.
By walking through a door and entering a room, we are confined and confronted by the walls, by the space within and the impressions of others.
So after doing some Chowhound research (Yelp reviews are completely not useful. The level of snark and meanness just makes me think all places sux inclu. my own lil amazing shop, but I digress..) we found two places that sound promising: Mann's and Rudy's. So off we went. Unfortunately we arrived at Mann's only to find that they had closed. They close at 8pm. Eeek too early for us. Oh well so off we set to Rudy's.

The book is a relatively quick read for non-fiction because the author has largely written about the subjects and events that a reader would be interested in e.g. were there any signs when Mike was a child and what event did eventually lead to a diagnosis. The author interweaves her family story throughout which is relevant and helps to give a perspective from their point of view and how the illness affected them.
Hello everyone! I'm really excited to show you my Christmas paper bag today. This is the first paper bag I decorate and I enjoyed it very much. I finally got to use my gorgeous "Tilda with snow heart" stamp from Magnolia Sweet Christmas Dreams collection.
Get out of Kamakura Station from the East Exit. Look for Komachi Dori which will be to the left of the bus terminal with a big red tori gate standing at the entrance. Right next to the tori gate is Baskin Robins. If you see McDonald’s sign to your left, you’ll see Baskin Robins and the red tori gate for sure. Walk 2 small blocks and turn right at the corner of a watch/clock store. The restaurant will be on your right. The restaurant doesn’t take a reservation, so there are usually people queuing outside. They are closed on Thursdays and sometimes they close in case of emergency or bad weather. The hours are from 11:45 am to 5:00 pm. If they sold out, they close the door at that point for the day.
The Taliban movement has a strong internal impetus and dynamic. Numerous studies have shown that there are endogenous drivers of the insurgency, and this is confirmed by the interviews. Taliban and Haqqani fighters are motivated by a range of factors, many of which relate to government predation, corruption or injustice, and the perceived aggression of foreign military forces. Thus, despite the claims of many interviewees, the ISI (and elements of the Pakistani military) may not actually control the Afghan insurgency, which implies power over all major dimensions of the movement and its campaign, and the ability to bring it to an end.

Of course I really do believe that money comes from hard work and from setting the right intentions and from walking through those open doors and from elbowing our way into those doors that are only slightly ajar and from bulldozing our way through the closed doors ... but only sometimes ... because sometimes the bulldozing gets us in, but like my wayward ivy, doesn't really get us where we need to be.
So I ask again, what is natural? What is our nature? Is our very concept of the organic so lost that the next natural evolution of the specie would be to manufacture our entire mind into an artificial structure beyond our current supercomputers? Will the metaphorical Skynet become a reality?

The story is my take on the origins of the werewolf. When I thought about the legends, I sat back and tried to re-imagine the reasons they exist in the fictional world.

Evening everyone. How's your week going? Mine, so so. Not liking the intermeral basketball that my daughter has started playing. Mondays game was cancelled because the school hosting wasnt ready. Today hosted at our school, the boys team showed up, but the girls team didn't know they played and didn't show up. So Sam hasn't played a game yet. Unknown when the next game is. Very unorganized.
These will come and go regularly without the necessity of year-long, often futile efforts to receive product when we want it, and as importantly, without the accompanying inventory expense. I’m guessing that representative small lists for Lambic, Cider and Mead will be maintained all the time, with appropriate rotation of brands within each, and maybe selections to be reserved as “Something of the Month.”

“This idea of balance, this idea of shared sacrifice, of a deficit plan that includes tough spending cuts but also includes tax reform that raises more revenue, this isn’t just my position,” he said. “This isn’t just a Democratic position. This isn’t some wild-eyed socialist position.” Rather, it argued, it is a position taken in the past by presidents from both parties who have signed major deficit-reduction deals.

Twitter is often used to call attention to a Website or a blog or other online destination. With only 140 characters to play with, it’s hard to say anything complicated, and thus Twitter often serves as an advertisement for lengthier treatments of a subject.

Do you ever do random things like this with your books? Can you guess what (classic) book this passage is from?
You see, for Hitler the spoken was always more important than the written word. It’s virtually impossible to quantify but I would hazard that that while Mein Kampf may have converted thousands- and I do stress may - the speeches converted tens of thousands. Indeed, Mein Kampf is more likely to have discouraged any potential convert by its convoluted and rambling message. If racist and fascist groups promote it today it’s because it’s Hitler’s ‘book’, a kind of icon, not because it has any real political power, any proselytising power.
Consider its main character, and note that he is never actually given a name. Instead, this nameless writer, who reluctantly agrees to ghostwrite the memoirs of an under-fire British government official, lives up to the film's title by hovering on the sidelines of the corruption he gradually uncovers. He's a relative nobody who gets caught up in political intrigue the depths of which even he can't quite believe. In that sense, he's a spiritual successor of Chinatown's Jake Gittes, the gumshoe who eventually uncovered corruption both political and, most devastatingly of all, personal. In that film, Polanski, taking his cues from the film noirs of the 1940s and '50s, treated Gittes's dawning realizations with a bleak solemnity that The Ghost Writer doesn't try to replicate. That lack of solemnity, however, doesn't quite obscure a palpable cynicism about human nature at its heart—a cynicism confirmed by the abruptness of its absurdist ending, in which all the paranoia with which Polanski so expertly infuses this seemingly low-stakes mystery comes rearing its head with an image that acts as a distorting mirror to a shot much earlier in the film. You could say it's the ending of Chinatown played lighter—but that doesn't make it less shocking.

But sadly, for too many people the wedding day is the most important thing it seems, followed closely by the size of the rock … Keeping up with, and outdoing, the Jones’ is often more important than the love in the room and the union of two people who have chosen to be together … and that’s sad, isn’t it?!

It's already been chatted up in shelter magazines, national newspapers and blogland. But in case you haven't heard, in July Lee Jofa announced its first licensed collection of home fabrics from fashion legend, Oscar de la Renta. The fabric collection includes 25 designs in silk, linen, velvet and cotton which range from delicate floral embroidery to ethnic-inspired prints. The fabrics feature the fine tailoring and opulent detail that is the Oscar de la Renta signature.

The base is made of pink bazzill in a long card (my friend wanted lots of room to write) and layered with white and some MME Quite Contrary DP. Across this is some Old Olive punched with Fiskars Upper Crest border punch, layered with white and more MME DP. Over this I've added some white satin ribbon. I've stamped Marci in Memento Tuxedo Black onto X-press It Blending Card and coloured with Copics (E000, E01, E11, RV10, RV21, RV13, G20, G21, V12, V15, E50, E51, E53, YR21). I've cut her out with scissors and popped her up on foam tape over a layer of Old Olive cut with Beaded Ovals Nestabilites and white cut with Large Oval Nestabilities. Next I've added some corner decorations and a rhinestone, the sentiment stamped and cut into a notched tag and secured to the ribbon with a bow.
So I will take these fleeting moments while they last. I will fully embrace the love that my children show to me on a daily basis. I will (hopefully) teach them how to show comfort to others, and to turn to God for their own comfort.
I stopped the car and walked up to the driver door. Usually the driver will sit there silently until I tell them why I've stopped them, etc., etc. Well as I stood by the driver door as the driver was rolling down her window, I get the "Why'd you stop me!" in that tone of voice like I had inconvenienced her.
"Is this the Republican primary or a John Edwards rally?" asked the National Review's Kathryn Jean Lopez, who has always preferred manly men and womanly women. She was referring to this Mike Huckabee comment at a rally in Michigan: "For those of us for whom summer is not a verb, for those of us who didn't go to fancy boarding schools on the east coast, for those of us who didn't grow up with a silver spoon, who were lucky to have a spoon — ask those folks and they'll tell you the economy is not doing well for them." Since when did Republicans care about working-class people?
Hi guys! I'm driving myself crazy trying to find a replacement chandelier for my dining room. You may have read about how I initially chose our current chandelier (along with all the lighting for our entire house) in about two hours with a fussy two month old in tow.

We have been collecting them for a solid two months after our lumber "experience"...these are not the ones you see stacked sky high behind Walmart or all over town though...they are pallets from businesses like the Jeld Wen Door guy and Auto Body Shops and Window stores...they are built out of 2x4, 2x6 and...1x4's! and they are very easy to get apart...they are straight, they do have nail holes in them and they do have some knots...and imperfections...but from the picture above of the original moulding and the plank wall imperfections? they fit right in! Picking thru our pile has netted us moulding for our entire house!

But the game was given away by an article ‘Vital’ new Chair for students’ in the pro-Zionist Jewish Chronicle. One of those providing the finance, publisher Lord Weidenfeld didn’t beat about the bush. The new chair wasn’t about promoting research and understanding etc., perish the thought. No it was ‘vital in the fight against anti-Zionism and antisemitism’. And we all know what Weidenfeld and company mean by ‘anti-Semitism’ – it’s not anti-Jewish hatred but support for the Palestinians and opposition to Zionism.

At the awards ceremony Gichuki gave out cash prizes to each team, based on performance. These were to be allocated to purely educational needs by the girls on the team, in consultation with their local principal. “And I will be personally following up and reporting on how each of you use this money!” Gichuki added. “Don’t just eat it. Bread and sodas are not your ‘educational needs.’”
That doesn’t mean, as Rubart demonstrated aptly, that a book has to be over the top religious. It doesn’t mean that a book has to be peopled with characters who are all Christians or who lack doubts and never suffer spiritual crises. We all suffer them.
But above, beyond and from behind that boon, the vengeful nature of the doinking adds an extra bit of spice to things. For instance, the other week, I had Abbott's wife spread over my executive leather sofa. As I expertly hammered away, I remembered every belittling comment Abbott had made that day and it contributed at least an extra 15% to my delivery. I thought, 'Have that, Abbott, you stupid sack of pig dicks!' It felt wonderful.
That interaction didn't go so well. In December, the guy wrote me a nice card saying he was flattered by the poems, and he wished me the best, but please don't write again. I was crushed, but I respected his request and didn't write another poem for him. I took the chance, and I failed at it.

Me, a freshman in classes with juniors, isn’t the one who should be lecturing on how stupid teenagers are. I’m an exception. I’m different. I have the brains and I use it to my advantage. There are teens that have the brains, but waste them. An example is Carla Biskey. In fifth grade, she hula hooped in the talent show. Now, she tries to ditch class every day. When she is at school, she smokes pot in the girls bathroom and makes my friend stand outside the bathroom and tell her if she can smell it or if anyone else is coming. She also isn’t exactly a virgin. Sure, she doesn’t have any STDs, but she’s slept with more guys that I most likely will ever kiss. And how do I know this? Well, she shared some of this in the middle of history class and she decides to post the best statuses on Facebook. And the thing that strikes me as ridiculous is that she’s a genius! She wants to go to Harvard or Yale. The best part: she really could. The only problem is: she doesn’t try. At all. She could be so much more than she is, but she doesn’t have the want to be something truly special.

This is where Memeoirs' programmers and creators need to be careful - yes, the love and travel email projects could be fun, but I think the real strength of the service is in a more commercial vein. I'm thinking particularly in regards to archiving important memo and legal correspondence, or annual company reporting, by department or globally. As an example, I get authors sending me email correspondence they have had over many months with publishers and agents, sometime including other third parties - publishers and agents they may have experienced difficulties with and require sound guidance and advice. Wading through these emails and getting the time-frame right as to who said what/claimed what and when they did can be a real nightmare.

I felt good that on Monday went out for Mexican and had fajitas without tortillas or rice and no dessert and only one glass of margaritas.
I would prioritise the employment of teachers and SNAs, “free fees” at 3rd level, the maintenance of HSE services, the income of low paid public servants (not in that order and plus some others) way, way above maintaining the present income of those in the category, “wealthy” who are also in public service employment. If this priority is accepted, then we need to think at what level would a public service income ceiling need to be set in order to make the required cut without affecting the priorities listed above? I find it bizarre that while we can debate unpalatable cuts because we are in crisis, the question of solving or partly solving the problem by limiting ALL public service incomes to, say, 100k for workers and 50k for pensioners is – it would seem – out of the question. Jesus wept, 100k and 50k are generous. They would appear a king’s ransom to most of the people Labour has traditionally defended.
Neurosis: a mental and emotional disorder that affects only part of the personality, is accompanied by a less distorted perception of reality than in a psychosis, does not result in disturbance of the use of language, and is accompanied by various physical, physiological, and mental disturbances (as visceral symptoms, anxieties, or phobias)

Obviously, everyone has defining events in their lives, things which will mark a sort of “before” and “after.” It’s generally not an entire year, though. But with Jackie, it seems like everything changed over the course of this one year and she had to decide how the rest of her life was going to go. She probably didn’t HAVE to work, but she chose to enter publishing. It’s highly possible that part of it was because (a) her second husband had just died and (b) her children no longer required as much care as they did when they were younger and (c) you can only fill so many days with shopping and a life of leisure.

God desires a change in our hearts, and will shake the world’s financial system to bring us out of bondage to Money and back to him. Having said that, those who listen to God’s warning now can take some practical steps to be prepared for the crisis. We don’t have to lose our whole life savings. (But even if we do, remember it’s just “very little” – no matter what the amount – compared to God’s currency.)
My contribution this week is a collection of baby items I’ve been working on for the shop in town Lake Tahoe Holidays and also my Etsy shop.

We added the EcoStrip to our desktop computer set up in May. I have noticed a small change in our electrical bill when I compare it to the usage last year during the same month. It’s not a huge financial savings, but it must be taken into account that it’s a completely hands-off approach to saving electricity. The strips cost around $35 and have posted an average savings of up to $100 per year on electricity. If we are only saving $3 per month – but I estimate that it’s closer to $5 – the strip has paid for itself in less than one year. I saved money I didn’t know I had spent and stopped using electricity I didn’t need or know I was using.

For me, the ideal show is one that successfully mixes elements of procedural and serialised drama. Shows that are solely plot feel heartless, but shows that eschew any sort of week-on-week drama render themselves dull as we are forced to watch the glacial pace at which human beings evolve.
Recent coverage of unschooling in the mainstream media has me once again thinking about starting the church of radical unschooling. When one holds beliefs as deeply as I hold my beliefs in RU, it can be rather frightening that it is possible for a government agency to interfere with how one lives. For the most part, this fear doesn't, well, worry me much: there is no provision in Washington state law for anyone to interfere, and even if there were, we have all our legal ducks in a row and could head them off at the pass (if you'll pardon the mixed metaphors). As a worst case, both our girls are old enough and academically competent enough to be graduated tomorrow if needed.
So, Mr Darcy explains himself in heartfelt letter and explains what did happen with Wickham. Turns out he’s a bit of dick and tried to marry Darcy’s 15-year-old sister to get at her money. Bad man. So Eliza’s opinion begins to soften a little, and she appears to be developing feelings for him too.
Although these later stories have shaped the development of the mystery genre, it is the Dupin tales that have been particularly influential. Dupin, the eccentric genius with superior reasoning ability, and his assistant, the nameless character who admires Dupin but is not his equal intellectually, constitute a detective team that numerous novelists have used as a template (Binyon 1989, 5). Dupin’s “illustrious” family connections (143), bohemian habits (144, 208), and desire to solve crimes for “amusement” and “mental excitement” (153, 144) are traits found in later fictional detectives. Especially noteworthy is Dupin’s reliance on logic, reason, and systematic procedures to solve cases. “Let us proceed methodically,” he tells his assistant (191).

Other fruits or berries can be used. If you use raw apples or pears, cut them very fine or grate. Blueberries are a natural choice but blackberries, raspberries and strawberries are terrific. Peeled and chopped oranges are also good. Either mix the fruit into the batter or use as in the pineapple version.
It also gives us a look at some of the more unique aspects of Japanese culture. A prime example is Japan’s obsession with mascot characters. A perfect example of a situation similar to Maromi’s (that cute little pink puppy to your right) is that of Usaru-san, the new bunny-in-a-monkey-suit who just got her own anime series, set to debut in October. I’m sure I’m not the only one who sees the smiling little face and can only hear “Yasumi na yo” (take a rest) over and over. Just like Tsukiko, designers at companies such as Sanrio and Media Factory can become briefly famous when their characters do well, but end up under tremendous pressure when they’re unable to repeat their success.

I made the “four ingredient” recipe for Swiss Chicken breasts last week. White meat is not my favorite and therefore made a lot of it for me to eat but it was quite tasty. I finished the last one for my lunch today. I added a little more liquid and sliced the meat before heating it in a sauce pan. Along with a slice of New York Garlic toast, it made a nice lunch. I was making it from memory (which is scary) and thought it was mushroom soup. As I searched my pantry cupboard, I discovered someone must have came when I wasn’t home and stole my mushroom soup! I later reread the recipe and found that it called for the chicken soup that I had used. I think it would be good with the mushroom soup, too. If I have a lot of time on my hands, the next time I think I will pound the chicken and then brown it before adding the soup and baking it. That is why I tell everyone to adapt the recipes to suit your family’s preferences.

I have been thinking over the past few weeks about how to maintain my cardcrafting momentum from Christmas. No matter how much you love an activity, life has a way of interrupting, so I wanted to pick up some kind of responsibility to keep me going. Doing something like a craft fair or making cards for soldiers is still more or less a committment to myself. I thought maybe a design team would be the ticket, especially a biweekly challenge so I could feel more confident about my ability to contribute. So, one night I closed my eyes and clicked submit on the old Linky for the DT call at Paper Crafting Journey. And then it was a daily check to see who else had submitted and how many someone elses had submitted. LOL I know, I know... pathetic. Well, we all have our weaker moments. =) There are just sooooo many awesome crafters out there that it's hard not to compare and feel at least a little bit inadequate or unskilled. I just remind myself that this is for fun and I'm not going to be -or expected to be- the next Michelangelo or Picasso of the cardmaking world. =)

Criss Cross has been out on DVD for many years now, and the US disc from Universal is an especially strong effort. It offers a near perfect transfer of the film with clarity, sharpness and contrast all at the high end of the scale. My only disappointment comes from the absence of any extra features, bar the theatrical trailer, for such a quality movie. One shouldn’t really complain, in these days of bare bones burn on demand discs, but this film does deserve a commentary track at the very least. Still, we have got an excellent piece of the filmmaker’s art looking great. Criss Cross is a highly rated production that occupies a prominent position in the noir canon, and it has earned that honour. It’s one of those rare films that checks all the boxes and never puts a foot wrong from its dramatic opening until it’s darkly cynical final fade out. Those who are familiar with the picture will know exactly what I’m talking about, and those who are not owe it to themselves to discover this little treasure. This is unquestionably one of the real jewels of film noir.
The first concept to learn from the dying is that suffering is a universal and necessary component of existence. In fact, every living thing suffers in its own way, and every living thing eventually dies. The reason suffering must be embraced is so that it can be used as a vehicle for learning the deeper lessons of life. To reject and resist pain is to prevent the growth suffering offers and actually results in more misery in the end. Yet our society teaches us that we are entitled to a life free of difficulty and struggle.
However, even during this self-imposed sports blackout, I remained committedly interested in college football. College football is so much fun to watch, because the teams are forever changing, and a team that is good one year/multiple years/decade, will flounder in ensuing years, due to poor recruiting, sanctions, etc. The action is slower and less polished than pro football; but because they're playing for either the simple love of the game, or because they're trying desperately to get onto a pro roster, the players are much more invested than the pro athletes seem to be.

“I was not there at the time but those who were there tending to their kebun (orchard) told me they (the two forestry officers) came armed with a shotgun and one named Pius Primus warned them ‘Kalau kamu tidak lari dari kawasan ini, besok kami datang tangkap kamu’ (if you don’t leave this place, tomorrow we will arrest you),” he told FMT.
Then my son came along. Again, Mum literally cried when I told her I wasn’t christening him. Mum told me if I didn’t get him christened, she was going to take him to church while she was babysitting him (she looked after him while I worked) and have it done. She was NOT risking her grandson going to hell because his mother was a heathen. So, after discussion with my husband, and a lot of thought, I decided to get the deed done, but, on MY terms. My Mum was born in Russia, so, as a child I went to Russian School, which was attached to the Russian Orthodox Church. During the Saturday School, we had four ‘classes’. Two of language, one of history and one of religion. For the last three years I was at the school, the priest was our religion teacher, but, he knew I was an atheist (one of the VERY few people I ‘came out’ to at the time). So, during the ‘religion’ classes, we did interesting things. We discussed all sorts of social, societal and philosophical questions. I remember we did a whole term on “subliminal suggestion in advertising”, where we discussed it, got ads and tried to find the subliminal messages in them, including finding little skulls in ice cubes in vodka ads, etc. But I digress. This priest knew I was an atheist. He’d allowed me to be ‘godmother’ to my beautiful god-daughter knowing I was an atheist (I will go into this more in another post, soon). So, I thought, I’ll ring him and discuss this whole child-christening thing with him.
The papers devote pages to the drugged and drunken antics of “celebs” and footballers while the celeb magazines and radio stations promote those who have degraded themselves on Reality TV shows. They show them leaving night clubs drunk and question whether they are wearing knickers or not. The people who make these programmes and write the magazines are educated and intelligent people so they know what they are doing to our young people.

Another point that caught my attention was that there was no mention at all of “Palestine” or “Palestinians” unless referring to Israel and Israeli Jews. Israel’s adversaries were simply called “Arabs”. The Palestinian nation was only invented in the 1960s. We must keep reminding ourselves, and more importantly the outside world, of this fact. The Palestinians were invented purely to subvert Israel’s historical and legal status in the Land of Israel.
I was oblivious during the illness. My memories are from recovery: I had to wear a diaper (how embarrassing!) and re-learn how to feed myself, walk on my own and speak some sounds (s and sh were difficult). I hated having to undergo multiple EEG tests. They used something akin to airplane glue to attach dozens of electrodes to my head. After the tests, my mother would have to cut the glue from my scalp. I ended up with ugly bald spots all over my head. Too bad it wasn’t during the punk era!

Thankfully, he did a little better than that. Instead, much like the Buffalo Bill guys (see a few posts below), they've made Punkin Ale, "a full-bodied brown ale brewed with real pumpkin brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon & nutmeg." I was honestly a little bit wary – I mean really, how many pumpkin beers do we need? – but you know, I actually like this quite a bit better than the Buffalo Bill stuff. The flavor is more subtle – I'm not sure I'd guess it had pumpkin if you didn't tell me – and it's quite sweet. In both respects, it is very much like Dogfish Head's Aprihop ale. Whereas Buffalo Bill is fun for the novelty but doesn't hold up to more than just one or samplings a year, this is a beer I could drink just about any time and consider it a real treat. Even if you've tried pumpkin beer and thought you didn't like it, you may want to give this one a shot.

Bill knew it was dead. How could it be otherwise? Bill's friend Liz worked at Deansgate Waterstone's for I don't know how many years. Yet - so Bill told me yesterday at a playwrights' Christmas gathering (where half of Manc, it seemed, was wearing Santa hats and yelling their heads off in the Duke's down in Castlefield) - when Bill went into Waterstone's recently for books for research, he had to spend one and a half hours looking for them because the staff had no idea where they were, and it was only after that time that they were discovered in the stock room.
Now that's a Grungy Christmas!

But, just because that is seen as necessary by Capital, does that mean that workers have to see that as the only, let alone best solution? Are there options besides seeing a total economic catastrophe? The answer is that, of course workers do not have to see this as the only or best option, as I wrote in that reply to Bruce Robinson back in 2007. First, let's look at the situation in Capitalist terms.
There were a few maddening moments, but that's gonna happen with family. These days, it's a very quick trip from indignant to compassionate (travel I do in my head anyway, so it's all good). It was a good trip, but it's always good to be home, too. I'm not really much of a traveler. I like to wake up in my own bed, putter around in my own kitchen for a cup of tea, drive my own car -- that kinda thing. Just a homebody, I guess.

In fact, parsing down their messages, we find that encouraging creative-competition is the very last thing on their minds.

First of all, any scene serious enough to warrant crime scene tape will have one officer there to record who enters the scene and who leaves, and when. That is their entire job. They can’t perform other duties and be absolutely sure about personnel going back and forth at the same time. Also officers will be stationed, one in front, one in back (at a minimum) to make sure no unauthorized person enters the scene. Otherwise an attorney will say someone snuck into the scene and planted the evidence that implicates their innocent client. If you are that client, you want that scene secured. In other words, once we leave we cannot come back, so these officers will remain there until we have done everything we think might possibly need to be done, which could be hours to days. The PIO may be gathering information to give to the press. The traffic homicide investigator willl be noting skid marks and taking measurements. Then you have people like me, who spend a lot of time walking out to my vehicle and back to get various pieces of equipment as I need them. I may be waiting for a co-worker to finish videotaping before I go inside to photograph, during which time they will wait outside for me. I may be waiting for a co-worker to bring some unforeseen piece of equipment from the station. We could all be waiting for a search warrant, which, though detectives will tell you they’ll have it in twenty minutes, always takes several hours. We also have to wait for the Medical Examiner’s Office investigator to arrive before we can touch or move the body. The crime scene is our jurisdiction, the body is theirs, and they cover three counties, so if they’re having a busy day we have to work around their schedule, almost always an hour or more. Higher-ups may arrive in order to do what they should do: get their butts out into the field to see what their subordinates are doing. Almost always they are disciplined enough not to enter the scene if it is not necessary, so they will be standing out by the road. Yes, some may be those who simply wanted to get out of the office or those who feel the need to stick their nose in to everything, but believe it or not, that’s fairly rare.

Writing prompt exercises are fine, but where do those come from? They come from another writer's imagination, that's where. What are you doing to stretch your own imagination? Look around you, pick common things up and examine them in detail. Think about them and ask questions. There are stories in everything, in everyplace, and in everybody. It's up to the writer to make those stories come to life in an interesting way.
Back then, as now, United fans massively outnumbered City fans in Manchester, so much so that when we played City at Maine Road we never got enough tickets.

Watching America’s ever-expanding debt crisis is like watching a finely-tuned female opera singer destroy herself.

Applause will rapidly die as the audience consumes her disgusting visage; they remember when she was young, vital, strong, purposeful and well-defined. Today, she is little more than a second-rate wench whose few remaining attributes are hidden beneath layers and layers of rotting adipose tissue.

With only 15 days in Indonesia before the end of our adventure, we were looking for an amazing experience to end on a high note. During our last few days in Japan, we floated around a few different options. We looked at helicopter tours, sky diving packages, fabulous hotels and hot air balloon rides before settling on our inevitable choice – an amazing dive trip. Indonesia is home to some of the world’s best diving – we’ve read many arguments back and forth debating some of the Indonesian areas vs. Sipadan, Malaysia (the best place we’ve ever been) as the top dive location in the world. It was a no-brainer.

After three days of no sun, it finally shined during my last break today and I ran out to the parking lot to stand in it. I figure ten minutes of sunlight should be worth 10mg Paxil. Then I got sick and had to run back inside. Sorry, I'm feeling a bit sorry for myself these past few days. Will try better in the next post.

Because of the house’s history (the Eleanor Roosevelt part), some of the community wanted the house preserved. The University wanted to tear the house down and build on the site. And so the traditional conflict between preservation and “progress” wore on for a few months until a rich local businessman with a fondness for preservation bought the house, cut it into four sections, moved it out to his ranch, re-assembled and restored it, and sold the house’s original site to the school. Everybody wound up happy.

After completing highschool at 18, Obari began working for Ashi Production, he began tackling the ropes of actual anime production with a mecha show called Tokusou Kihei Dorvack and followed on into Ashi Pro’s next show called Seijuushi Bismarck where he moved up from an in-between artist to become a key animator. Following Bismark’s end, he continued at Ashi Pro where he worked on episodes of the shows the studio got subcontracted to, both Japanese and American shows. One particular American show was the original Generation 1 Transformers. Like many American cartoons outsourced during the 80s, none of the outsourced staff were credited, however Transformers was known quite well for it’s varying levels of quality, so you can certainly see episodes in which Obari, or at least Ashi Production had a hand in.
Worryingly, you do not appear to appreciate the level of ignorance surrounding ME that is found within the medical profession. It is not possible for patient groups to work with the NHS, nor for patients to expect their doctors to come up with individual treatment programmes, when so many false assumptions are made about the illness (and therefore the patient) in the first place.

The event, organized by Leslie Westbrook of the Academy Art Museum, with help from the Washington Moroccan Club, will feature a souk—a market where artisans, craftsmen, and vendors sell Moroccan handmade goods, carpets, caftans, leather goods, and spices.

His Excellency Ambassador Rachad Bouhlal, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Morocco to the US, will be a special guest and will officially open the event with a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

"I am a Texas native currently living in a small West Texas town. My husband and I lived in Chicago for a couple of years while he was going to school and that is where my love for sewing got started. I did not handle the winters there very well and decided to take sewing classes so I could have an indoor hobby when I was cooped up inside because of the weather. The first thing I ever sewed was a skirt made with Amy Butler fabric. I became obsessed with her fabric and ordered some on Ebay one day. Little did I know the seller was A Joyful Soul Fabrics, and just minutes from where I grew up in Texas! After my husband graduated we moved back to our hometown for a little while and I contacted Joy to come and see some fabric in person. I started sewing about 5 years ago and still have a lot to learn, but mostly enjoy making things for my home such as curtains, pillows and bedding as well as having the ability to do easy alterations.I still love Amy Butler and have some new favorites such as Heather Bailey and Anna Maria Horner. Lucky for me Joy sells those designers in her shop so I have never had to venture off too far when buying fabric. We kept in touch over the last few years and just recently reconnected which led me to a position to help her market her business! I am very excited to be a part of her team and look forward to contributing to the success of A Joyful Soul Fabrics!" ~Lindsey

Perhaps I should pause here to note that, between gazing on these Girls with disbelieving annoyance and laughing my butt off, I can’t believe no one has done this before. This writing is crisp, subtle, tight. The characters interrupt each other with non sequiturs so realistic and ridiculous that I want to watch all the episodes again to make sure I caught all the best jokes.

A bloody good collection, I think. A real mix of intimate and industrial, his poems are stripped down, gritty and beautiful. They explore the darker, grimmer parts of life, as well as the more physical and real emotion aspects of being... He has a way with words and images that builds distinct sensory details into a broad landscape.
I never will forget the first time I fried pork chops for my soon-to-be husband...I was careful to do everything just right so they would turn out golden brown and slightly crunchy. Yummy! When I set that plate of four pork chops on the table, Adam smiled. We said grace and then scarfed down three chops before I could finished chewing up my one. When he told me how good they were, and asked where "the rest" were, I know my jaw hit the floor. The rest? I didn't buy the family pack of 12 for two people.
Arena 19 – Truth be told, I have not watched either of these shows yet, so I know nothing about who they are or how they are going to fare by the end of this one. Both of them have their series still airing. If I had to guess, I would think that the Mōretsu Pirates team would win, since they have been around longer; therefore, people would be more familiar of them. Upotte!! is pretty decent, so people may still be unsure as to who it is they are going to be faithful to. Mōretsu Pirates also has a popular voice actor in their arsenal , so this may be another factor to their victory.

So I arrive at the gym in my little workout clothes with my bottle of water and towel. The class is pretty crowded for a Sunday morning with people of all sizes and ages. A lot of them were a lot heavier than I am. I thought to myself "Ha! Piece of cake!"
The first time I went to the hospital, I received shots of terbulatline, and when those didn't work, I got the mag. Magnesium sulfate is what the doctors called "the big guns" when it comes to stopping pre-term labor. Mag makes you hot, and sleepy, and confused. It also worked; the contractions stopped, and I went home. I was on oral procardia and home contraction monitoring. The next five trips to the hospital were short outpatient visits: I got more terb shots and went home. The final time I went to the hospital, the terb didn't work. The contractions kept coming. They put me on magnesium sulfate again. But it didn't work that time.

Looking back at the posts now, I guess there really much to say except that I'm definitely much happier, I have developed a taste for grits and friend Pickles, also I write much longer posts. But who gives a dam really. I feel more awesome than ever before. I have more friends than ever, I'm on the write track with school, for Pacmans sake I even quit World of WarCraft Cold turkey without even looking back once. That is an achievement on it's own. I should get points for that.
Dr. Treves' first encounter with Mr. Merrick was a circumstance of chance. The storefront where Mr. Merrick was exploited as a freak was directly across from the hospital where Dr. Treves practiced surgery. It was in this godforsaken place of business where Dr. Treves observed the ghastly lack of sustenance and comfort due every human being as birthright.

Hundreds of refugees from West Pakistan, who have been living in wretched conditions at different places in Jammu province since 1947, today reached Delhi by buses to attract the attention of the Union President, Prime Minister, Union Ministers and MPs to the problems they have been facing as a result of refusal on the part of the state government to grant them citizenship rights by sitting on dharna at Jantar Mantar. They had migrated to Jammu from Pakistan in the wake of the country’s communal partition to escape the wrath of the protagonists of two-nation theory that had resulted in the emergence of Pakistan as a separate country. Almost all of them are members of depressed communities. It may appear ludicrous, but it is a fact that these refugees numbering about 100,000 do not enjoy the right to immovable property, right to job under state government, right to higher and technical education, right to bank loan, right to vote in the assembly and local body elections and so on even after more than 64 years of the state’s accession to India. They can vote only in the Lok Sabha elections and are eligible only for the central government jobs, which they cannot get because they are not suitably educated. They wanted to quit Jammu in 1947-1948 itself and settle in other parts of India, but they were barred by then political leadership of the time to leave the state. They were assured by the then state wazir-e-azam and others who mattered that they would take appropriate steps calculated to empower them to exercise all rights available to the people of the state and their fellow countrymen. They did nothing in that direction.

Many hundreds of years later, barber poles still exist to symbolize a barber shop. The first organization of barbers was founded in 1094. The practice of barbering is said to be around since 6000 BC. It involved the practice of hair cutting, teeth extraction, medicines, and other specialized surgical procedures. How many of those barbers today do any blood letting, amputation, or teeth pulling?
“What, PIG, had enough? You have enough yet, greedy bitch?” Falling on her as she lay on her back he lifted her legs and held them wide. The crop landed hatefully on her bare glistening pussy, and even slapping meanly at the tail protruding from her throbbing ass. In pure inexplicable rapture and torture she cried and whimpered in unintelligible words around the slobber and snot of her bawling. She was so far gone she barely noticed that he was no longer hitting her until his fingers invaded her crudely. Still bent and held in a spread between his body and arm he shoved fingers deep into the hot mire between her legs. “Wiggle that tail, little pig, let me feel it.” He fingered her deep and she used her muscles in blind obedience to move the little swirl of tail, feeling the plug push and shift against his fingers.

So we got home and I thawed out a couple of filets and threw Tony Cachare's (Drew loves it so much) on one and the Texas Ranch on the other. I pan sauteed the fish to great results and added some brown rice and steamed yellow squash. We split the fish and loved the results. I am going to have so much fun coming up with different flavor combinations and cooking methods for our gigantic bag of Mahi. Oh, and I even took a picture that didn't turn out that great.

As you are all aware, there are 365 days in a year, of which 52 are Sundays and let’s presume that other holidays and official leave amount to around 20 days; which would mean that these 3 Registrars functioned for only about 293 days a year. Thus each Registrar conducted around 9 hearings in a seven hour workday apart from granting 76 trademark registrations in one day. What do you think is the quality of trademark registrations during this period? I’m thinking, not too good.

Memories play tricks on a tired, strained brain. Time warps. Misunderstanding surges. Words never said, speak of things never promised. Imagination. Delusion. Hope. Big words to explain things going bad. I work to drown. No getting ahead.

As the mother sat on the table she couldn’t help but think of the first day she had seen her husband, the boy’s dad, her man. That was quite a different story. She had just finished doing her family’s laundry and was hanging the last clothes on the line when the cry went out. Her village had a system of warning the inhabitants of danger, the cry did portend danger, it was a war cry. She hurriedly told her frail older brother to get into the hut, he was dying of fever, it had spread into his lungs and she was powerless to stop it, she could not bring herself to imagine of a world without her older brother, she could not bring herself to imagine a world all alone. The only remaining blood relative she had was her brother, seeing as it was her mother and father had been thrown into a well when she was just two years old, the charge was sorcery. The villagers let her and her brother live, but on one condition, the brother was to take her and turn his back on the village and keep warning, never to come back.
One thing I’ve added to the original design is some sticky fabric furniture feet to stop it moving around whilst the fan is on. I have to say the idea of using a clear box is very good, as is placing the fan off-centre (I’m left handed, so the fan is on the right).

I've always been afraid of public speaking, and for that reason joined International Toastmasters when I first arrived in BsAs, where I met some fabulous folks and got some experience but never conquered my fears. Still, it's a chance for personal growth, as they say.

She went on to say that they had painted the room green and they loved the colors purple and red. "We don't want something to "themey" because we want it to be able to grow with her, but we like the idea of a lady bug and flowers because we're doing a garden theme in her room". The one criteria that her husband was adamant about was that there could be NO dinosaurs (although I think...he was joking...and I contemplated putting one on the bottom shelf just for kicks and giggles).
She’s the center of the love triangle. Literally the center of everyone’s eyes. True this makes her a bit of a pawn…but I think because she’s so much like her mother it torments Heathcliff a bit. And you know that man deserves a bit of torture…Catherine (1) did promise to haunt him from the grave. Little did Heathcliff know it would be her living daughter. Not that this will save Catherine (2). Nope, it’s just firmly cementing her as a tool for Heathcliff.

• The Oxford introductions to US law: Intellectual property, by Dan Hunter, published by Oxford University Press. The author explains how intellectual property has contributed greatly to the innovations that society needs today, describing ways in which the expansion of IP can reduce innovation by stopping others from implementing great ideas or producing new work. The author seeks to help readers think about modern IP in a way that allows them to see how innovation and progress are linked to IP law, and how small changes in the laws have had significant consequences for our society.

Rapid attention and treatment is most efficient in the hospital, and therefore we recommend that patients who experience chest pain be evaluated in the emergency department of the hospital rather than an outpatient urgent care center.

Jesus references an incident recorded in 1 Samuel 21:1-6, in which David and his men are hungry and tired while on the run from Saul – the jealous and erratic kill of Israel at the time. David comes to Ahimelech the priest and asks him for food. And the priest offers David the ceremonial bread presented before the LORD in the Tabernacle, the only food available at the moment. This bread was only supposed to be consumed by priest after it was removed from God’s presence.

The New England interagency team has identified two primary objectives. First, commit the federal agencies to even greater and more responsive participation in landscape-scale conservation collaboratives by identifying and reducing barriers to federal participation. Second, the federal agencies will pursue opportunities to accelerate efforts to improve water quality and restore associated habitat. The interagency team recognizes that there are several important consensus-supported conservation objectives for the great northern forest landscape that are not expressly included in the objectives above. These include maintaining working farms, increasing recreational access to the great outdoors, and strenthening the link between rural development and working forest restoration. It remains an overriding goal of our work to identify and leverage overlapping federal agency opportunities wherever possible.

Having now had time to read and digest Judge David Berchelmann's findings of fact (pdf), I think I've honed in on what bothers me most about this outcome. Berchelmann concludes that Judge Keller "did not violate any written or unwritten" rule of the court. But his own description of facts in the case defies that conclusion. He describes the detailed, unwritten procedures followed by the court in death penalty cases - rotating turns as the "duty judge" in charge of all after-hours communications in the case. Aren't these "unwritten rules," one might wonder? And didn't Keller violate them?

She sent me her very own ARC of Baby Proof just because I was nervy enough to ask, I've been out to dinner with her, she taught me how to smile properly (touch the back of your teeth or the roof of your mouth with your tongue as the camera clicks), and she let me cut in line in front of everyone the day before I had to move from Chicago to Scottsdale! I truly consider her a friend. I hope she says the same of me.
Here is my page.
I haven’t updated this blog in a while and it’s been even longer since I wrote about anything sport-related, so I figured I’d break silence on that front. The main reason, as mentioned back in February is that I have been recovering from a foot injury called Plantar Fasciitis. I had never heard of this before I went to a foot doctor, but it turns out that it’s common among people from all walks of life. Many of whom, incidentally, all wanted to provide guidance to me on how to get rid of it.

Drain and rinse a can of black beans. In a saucepan mix beans, a can of corn(drained), and finely chopped red onion. Season with cumin, chili powder, garlic salt, oregano, and onion powder. Cook until heated. NOTE: You will need some liquid in the pan while cooking. You can either use a splash of chicken broth or water.

Death’s seventeen-year-old apprentice, Nathaniel, comes into his own as he leads an uprising against the Devil with the help of a half-dead wraith and a giant hit-man. What results is a bloody, brutal revolt that calls upon the loyalties of both the living and the dead.
If you really knew me YOU would know looks aren’t the most important thing to me.
I wanna express my gratitude for my family and my best friend for the awesome dinner that night. Oh! And I’m thrilled that BERSIH 3.0 happened on the same day as my birthday. How awesome is that!? Anyway thank you so much for all the greetings and prayers from everyone. I’m grateful for all the people in my life. God bless you all!

Rather than go with a white changing table, I'd opt for a whitewashed beauty from Wisteria to add a little more texture and depth to the room (also I'm obsessed with Wisteria and will use any excuse to shop there, even if it's just pretend shop.) Over the changing table, I'd hang a pretty capiz faux chandelier. Baby's spend a lot of time on their backs on the changing table so why not have something pretty for them to look at right? Finally I'd frame some vintage alphabet art and another beautiful print for the walls and use wire baskets to corral odds & ends. These are actually clam baskets in a galvanized metal finish. But they're a great size and price and I wanted something with a little harder edge than the more predictable wicker baskets could provide. Anthropologie's Coqo floral rug in lime would ground the whole space and add a gorgeous pop of color.

Sometimes I conclude that I am the absolute averages of all these reflections. If this were a video game, I would be the first choice in a selection screen, all my stats equal and my trademark color red. The thought makes me feels ambivalent, to be simultaneously mediocre and exceptional.

This was my first attempt at a triangle lace shawl. I've always loved them, but was always a little bit intimidated by them. It was the shaping and the lace that scared me, I was afraid, it wouldn't come out right.
In January, I was ready to take this a step further and made another choice to make an effort. Instead of just being "not a bitch," I made the choice to try to reach out and extend kindness with effort. That's different from just being "not mean." It meant putting myself out there more. It meant risking more. Actually, it meant risking a lot. Not only do you risk being slapped down by the people who lie on the other side of your warlines... but you also risk getting slapped by the people who lie on YOUR side. "Why are you talking to them? They're the BAD PEOPLE, remember??"

Something was about to happen. And he just knew that it was another Power surge. It was coming. He wondered exactly what they were, what was causing them. And he wondered also how in the hell he knew? And, in that moment of doubt, he allowed his mind to fly before he could control it, bring it back to himself. But it came back with two words: Page 4. That made no sense.

3) Nobody is flooding Black nations and ONLY Black nations with non-Blacks and saying, “Its OK, there is no such thing as race. So we are going to replace Black people with a blended people.” This is happening in White nations and ONLY in White nations. They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White. Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White. And what they want IS genocide.
This image may seem simple at first, but the shot-from-below angle adds a great deal of drama and intensity, as it should, as this was a huge re-launch for the JLA. Up to this point, the book had meandered for more than a decade, featuring whatever haphazard cast of characters were free at the moment. Agent Liberty? Why not! Ice Maiden? C’mon over! That girl that was on that team in the eighties? Remember her? What the heck! This was a new beginning. Superman. Wonder Woman. Batman. Green Lantern. Aquaman. The Flash. Martian Manhunter. No more. No less. THIS is what the League should be. (Too bad creators forget that all too often.) You’ll have to forgive Superman’s long, 90s, grunge hair which looks less mullet-y here than it did at other times.

I’ve recently aquired a new lens, a bit of a must do thing really, because my old lens was struggling in darker conditions. Although that lens had a constant aperture of F4 and produced some amazing results, I always struggled when it came to taking good quality images in low light situations.
That happy road made the whole journey brighter, less daunting for me. My mind meandered out the window into the passing trees and fields and back to the warm cabin of the car with the best driver in the world. We wended around the bend and up the hill with such ease, the sun was out but I can’t remember what time of year it was.

Not much has happened garden wise since my last post. The chives are still going strong, the peas sprouted and are now about 2 inches high. The strawberries are flowering and have taken over another foot into the Roma tomato area. Everything in the inside seed trays looks pretty good, some of the little pepper plants have some yellowish leaves, but I hope to be able to pull them through till it’s time to plant them outside. The crocuses, daffs, and tulips that managed to hide from the squirrels have come and gone and half the front bed is being taken over by the exuberant bleeding heart bush. Next year I really should take pictures of everything as it comes and goes. The front bed kind of transforms throughout the growing season.

Noble’s ramblings were once again up to his usual high standard, he does close on 3 hours tonight, and the whole time he paces the stage, like a caged tiger looking for a way out. Caught in traffic on the way to the venue he tells us that he found himself stuck outside the Jehovah's Witness church in Southend, leaving his mind to wander on how they would react if he had to knock on their door in the event of an emergency… A line about his own funeral arrangements had a friend and I in serious trouble - both unable to control our laughing for several minutes after he had moved on! And all he said was he's thinking of being placed in a coffin with sausages down his trousers, a few chops down his pants and a pound of mince meat under a top hat. He said he liked the idea of everyone salivating as the coffin rolled slowly into the flames, roasting the contents to perfection…. You probably had to be there, but his overactive brain throws this stuff out all night long.

Mr. Eugene Bremond, Dear Sir,
I am currently a librarian; I lurked there for so long recommending books to patrons and shushing people, that I suspect they only hired me so it would be less creepy. Now I'm armed with a name tag, and a thin veneer of credibility. I'm also a musician with synaesthesia – which isn't an issue until someone plays a wrong note, which makes me want to squirm inside out. It makes for a good live show.
So what I been working on is my Wild Flower short film. It's been in the making for quite awhile now, delayed because of location issues and funding. My very talented film maker friend approached me about a year ago wanting to get together and make a short film.....and it would feature the latest pieces I have been making.

We can learn from the death of the students of Rabbi Akiva the importance of mesora and how we have to be careful to keep it perfectly intact. Rav Aharon explains that if these students would have lived they would have been the future Tannaim and the baalei mesora. Respecting our friends means having objectivity to accept the truth of another opinion even if you did not think of that idea first. Rav Aharon explains that the students had a problem with their learning. They could not put aside their personal ego to concede their friend’s position even if it was true. If they would have lived, their mesora would have been corrupted because they were lacking in middot. Instead of passing on a corrupted tradition, they died.

In the Mass Effect 3 leaked script the character we know of James is mentioned a few times, however another character named Jimmy is also mentioned just as much as him. Diana Allers is also not mentioned in the script at all. James Vega – called James Sanders at the time – is mentioned at some points but there are other times where Jimmy is mentioned. Likewise in the information released so far for Mass Effect 3 even going so far back as April when Game Informer first released there Mass Effect 3 story makes no mention of this Jimmy whatsoever. This leads me to think the following:
So... on to a crazy idea I have.

The important thing I learned from this exercise is that we are motivated ultimately by feelings and not by happenings. Our motivation doesn’t come from outside events but our reaction to it. This is really powerful. Once you find out what your motivator is and you realise that you have complete control over your own emotions and feelings do you think you can use that in some way?
Well, that is it for me.

Tahini is simply a paste made from ground sesame seeds. There are several types out there however, ranging in colour, texture, flavour and of course processing techniques. The traditional Middle Eastern versions tend to be on the lighter and more liquid side of the scale, where I’ve noticed that “western” versions are darker, thicker and taste richer. The reason for this is usually because traditional tahini is made from hulled sesame seeds, meaning that the outer bran has been removed. Certain types of tahini then, cannot be considered a whole food because part of the original food is missing. When the bran is removed from the sesame seed much like when the bran is removed from a wholegrain, a great deal of the nutrition, and the cofactors needed for complete digestion, are lost. In the case of sesame seeds, we’re talking fiber, calcium, zinc, iron, and phosphorus taking a serious hit, and don’t we want those things? Indeed we do.
And the bottom line?

I love homeschooling! Let me tell ya, the idea to dye clothes with a six and four year old in attendance is nothing I'd have contemplated doing were it not for homeschooling! But they helped as much as they could and it was a fun experience for us all. We read the Aeneas book in between the timed stirring sessions, which was just so "warm & fuzzy."

It is microwave and dishwasher safe. Instructional booklet is provided.
Thanks to that comparatively-not-really-traumatic experience, I loathed spaghetti squash for nearly two decades. (Chili for only one.) Then, earlier this year a few friends and I traveled to Victoria BC, where we were served Spaghetti Squash Casserole. Not wanting to insult my hosts, I took a bite. And then another. And then had some wine. And then took 12 more bites. And then … you get the picture.

Truck drivers are under a tremendous amount of stress from the job and from being away from home so much, this can lead to mental health issues. This is such a common problem that the FMCSA Medical Review Board has suggested regulations be enacted so that doctors performing DOT physicals look for signs of depression.
The president faces political pressure from a war-weary public as he runs for re-election in November. A Pew Research Center poll released in April found that Americans’ support for the war hit a new low, with 60% saying they want the U.S. to withdraw troops as soon as possible and 32% wanting them to stay there “until the situation has stabilized.” Among swing voters, who will be decisive in the November election, 59% want the war to end as quickly as possible.

Except where noted, items will be shipped USPS flat rate $10.95 anywhere in the country. I'm really trying to move this stuff out of here so prices are low. Hope you find something you like to finish (or start!) a project.
I'm slightly ashamed of how many blues I gathered upon a quick inspection of my polish collection. I have pales, mediums, deeps, brights, shimmers, glitters... you name it and I probably have it. For this comparison though, I stuck with the lights and dusty lights-mediums. The first three shades are not dupes at all, but they serve as a sort of comparison to the comparison, if you will. It is interesting to see how much green is in What's With the Cattitude and "Baby" Blue compared to a true light blue- Joe's Powder Blue.

I warned him that I'm a HUGE texter. And maybe he didn't believe me... but after a day, he said, "Wow you do like to text!" And I immediately got scared because that didn't sound very good. I apologized... not knowing what to say to that. But he reassured me it was ok and he was just kind of playing with me. Guess it was my paranoia because I tend to just text like crazy and it probably comes off as real needy. The fact is that i'm BORED and I just find texting to be a good way to pass the time. But anyway...
Given that modern slaves have limited access to actual facts –the foundation of the economy of scarcity–, we must often make due with inferences based on observation, which is a double-edged blade that can be used against us by those in the know. Thus it is vital to discern what we are “observing”, especially with so many narratives competing for our finite attention span.
Add the vanilla and beat to mix it in. Add the confectioner’s sugar and beat that in. Use a spatula to scrape any sugar that clings to the sides of the bowl into the cream. Beat in the tapioca flour, one Tbs. at a time, until you have your desired consistency. Again, scrape any flour on the sides of the bowl into the cream. That’s it. You have whipped cream! Chill for an hour or two before serving. Don't forget to lick the spatula and the beaters (after you remove them from the mixer, of course :)
A thought I’ve got, from reading up on the ethics of Maimonides (and the various Muslim philosophers, as well as Aristotle), is a though on what the purpose of politics are?

The corners are especially tricky to wrap. They just wrap all wrong (see in picture below left side?). I found that if you wrapped it once, then let it unravel and wrap it up again you get the best results. It seems easier to wrap it right when you aren't passing it through the center every turn.
Chris has continued to work as a technical assistant at Swinburne University. I think he's a little frustrated with his work at the moment though and would like to move on though. He's completing a three day chocolate course in a couple of weeks which is something he has wanted to do for ages. Maybe a career change to professional chocolatier?!
It really was the story of the girl screaming in the dark and not being heard. When I was early on in my pregnancy, I had a bloodtest result that was the first red flag that may or may not had been an indicator of what was to come. The result was a low PAPP-A, (plasma associated with plasma protein A), The result was that of a 1. This was at 13 weeks. They told me this result, what it can point to is that it can be associated with eventual intrauterine growth restriction, they told me, but not to worry, with good medical care, this would not happen to us, not with the vitamins he was prescribing, hahaha . They said, they would give me extra ultrasounds in the 3rd trimester. Nothing to worry about they said, he only had one other patient with this low result before and everything turned out just fine. I now also know that this low result could also be linked to potentially eventually developing Preeclampsia. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21427871

I have truly loved reading the blogs that have linked up as well as appreciated the support, comments and shares. I will still be joining in-I just won't need to be so organized and be first. And of course Yay For Home! isn't going anywhere, hosting this meme had just run it's course for me.
Everyone has experienced the power of the tongue whether good or bad. We’ve each felt the wonderful affirming words of a friend which helped so much. Or, maybe we have felt the painfully cutting words which seemed to tear out our heart. It has been said that we are what we eat, but we will see that in actuality we are what we speak. What we say is a direct insight into what we are.

the two sides of this coin share little by way of requisite skills. Going out and (effectively) hunting a woman is the light. It's the time-worn Hemmingway-esque approach that relies on confidence, optimism, showmanship and out-gunning the next guy. It's the shotgun blast and reload approach.
Faith isn't really faith until it overcomes doubt. And if it's real, questioning it makes it stronger. I like that Laura is questioning it. I like that she's not blindly accepting what she's been told. I like that she's okay with seeking answers and not finding them, as long as she finds something that works for her. The answers don't need to come from a church, they just need to be her answers.
I am in charge of a great deal of things at Crown. At times I feel overwhelmed, but I dearly love the college and the fantastic people here. I am worried for them as I try to tie up loose ends to hand everything over to the rest of the marketing team.

She has a serious boyfriend, she's about to start her junior year of high school, and she has a tight group of girlfriends. But when her boyfriend moves across the country and decides the long-distance-relationship thing just isn't for him, Chloe's devastated. Worse, she soon learns that when you're the prettiest girl in school and totally unattached, everyone starts treating you differently. Girls don't trust you, guys aren't sure what to make of you, and everyone assumes you're either spoiled, dumb, or both.

Franklin goes on to describe from the inside the post-war building up of Covent Garden, in which he played a conspicuous part. Then a most important part of the book is concerned with the problems of the singer in preparing a major role. He takes the reader through two contrasting parts in his repertoire, Baron Ochs in Rosenkavalier, and Sarastro in The Magic Flute. He includes provocative comments about the standards of teaching singing in England, about singing operas in English, and about the historical reasons for the condition of professional music in Britain.

Look at that sky!! We've had some beautiful sunsets lately and I was lucky enough to have my camera to hand and someone to hold Billy for me when I saw this one. The Lincolnshire Fens get a raw deal, often being described as being flat and boring, but one of the beauties of living here is all the sky around and the way you can see the sunsets right down to where they fall away from the world, and no pesky mountains in the way!
Despite these faults, Behold the Man ends with a powerful scene that is easily among Moorcock's best. It is not a pathetic, wretched event that we witness, but rather a transformative one that serves to unite Glogauer's fears and obsessions into a moving commentary that makes this book a true masterwork of science fiction. It does not matter if you believe in the Passion or whether you are skeptical that there was even a human named Jesus in the first place. Behold the Man asks the reader to do precisely that and in the act of beholding, something occurs that makes this conclusion one of the more memorable ones. Highly recommended.
