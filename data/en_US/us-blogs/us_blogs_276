Sadly, I was only half right. I did, indeed, have to go and get her, but - sigh - it was head lice.
I register all volunteers for the conference through SinC (that gets each volunteer a “conference pass.”
Moving on, though, I tried to keep an open mind about Pottermore. There’s plenty of stuff to do there. You can explore every chapter, reading about the characters, places, objects, spells, potions, or books in that scene. You can click around each scene to find books, Chocolate Frog cards, potion ingredients, or magical objects.
The Pinot Noir is slowing him down.
These are just a few ideas as to how I could go back in time and improve my life, I have hundreds more. But the main problem is that my younger self probably wouldn’t listen to any of them. Even more so when he takes one look at the bloke sitting in front of him and then runs away screaming, “I turn into that!!!!!”

A couple of the other tracks wouldn't be quite such an obvious 'comfort mode' setting compared with the ones my car seems to prefer. We had one with a non workplace friendly title, then a Vampire Weekend tune, some Babyshambles, two different songs featuring A&E in the title, 'A13 Trunk Road to the Sea' by Billy Bragg, Captain Beefheart and his magic band singing 'Abba Zabba' and Nico singing 'Abschied' amongst the early selections.
So I am going to keep my post short...I just wanted to show you all a card I managed yesterday evening...

Boy, that must have been something, though.
“We can confirm that our foreign affairs correspondent Jonathan Miller and his team have been arrested whilst reporting for the programme from a village in Bahrain,” Channel 4 News spokesperson said. “Our primary concern is for the safety of the team, and we are working with the appropriate authorities to secure a swift release.”
I think that helped me understand how to break down that daunting task and figure out a way to apply it to my own life. So I sat down with a little notebook and began to write down my goals - one or two for each area. I hope that this will help me to love and serve God better. My daughter helped me with some suggestions and it really helped me to see her enthusiasm. She is working on her Faith in God book.
I was hoping with Andrei “Hotty” Arshavin would step his game up but he wasn’t even on the starting lineup. His able replacement TR7 sent a glorious through ball that the receiver (El Capitan) would have been proud of. With Walcott on the right hand side and Everton defenders on the left, El Capitan fired a shot that left Bald Howard relatively untroubled.
I should know. A few weeks ago, I joined a great company as a Sales Representative. My job is to drive around and sell products and services that make people’s lives safer. I like the job, but I can tell you this. Being a salesman is a tough job. There are just so many things to learn and remember. I was even told that what I was selling was so good that it would practically sell itself. I agree with the good part, but I learned a valuable lesson yesterday. I was up late, and decided to sleep in. I left google directions on the table, and a few dollars for coffee. When I awoke at noon, the directions, and money were still sitting on the table, nothing was sold, and I had to drive around all afternoon looking for leads to catch up on sales.

I love it because the circuits and sessions push me past where I would normally go on my own. It is a cross fit style of work out so it develops ALL of your body. I realized that I am not as strong as I thought in some areas, but I felt much stronger AFTER I finished the work outs!! And, yes, I finished them ALL!!!!

The paper, just published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience, is a compilation of research findings from scientists all over the world who used all kinds of research methods. The bottom line to all these studies: musical training has a profound impact on other skills including speech and language, memory and attention, and even the ability to convey emotions vocally.

In talking to Holiday Isle Dive Shop manager Kelly, he too wasn’t sure about the “World’s Largest” title but did enlighten me on another interesting tale of the tank. The tank itself is authentic and is thought to have been originally purchased from our countries own space program NASA and is currently filled with a guage topping dose of national pride, fulfilled hopes & dreams of our nations former SPACE RACE glory days. The tanks frontal accessories, its yellow & blue harness is called a BCD (Buoyancy Control Device) that were first artistically formed out of foam and then permanently preserved as we see it now in lasting fiberglass. A hot spot for years, this marina is filled with shops, bars and now home to the Keys Largest Scuba Tank!
On August 22, 2011, I sent a 311 request (number 11-00259888) for bollard replacement. Many had been run over or were missing, and I frequently observed dangerous and illegal turns. The request wasn't resolved for over 3 months. On December 2, 2011, I received the short reply "NO WORK NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED. PER VICTOR N."
Then of course I have to get home, which may be slightly more of a challenge!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've heard it all before. Create a schedule, do 10 minute blocks of cleaning throughout day, polish your sink before you go to bed, find a cleaning fairy and it goes on. No matter which way you look at it, our homes need to be cleaned or tidied at some stage or another. It will never go away.

Your self-proclaimed hilarious webmistress,
The mouse is a physical manifestation of the unreliability of memory, as it scurries into memories where it previously hadn't existed, its presence distracting Claude from the moment; is the mouse actually changing the past, or only changing Claude's memories of the past? Another animal, the cat that Catrine and Claude keep as a pet, appears, it seems, only when Claude remembers that it exists. Suddenly, once the cat is mentioned, they have a cat. The memory that they have a cat seems to shift the cat into existence, or back into existence. It raises the question: can something be said to exist, or to have happened, if we don't remember it? It's as though memory is populating and creating the world through its functioning. Claude's wartime memories, which similarly seem to be unreliable, are an interesting and unresolved undercurrent in the film. He refers several times to his experience in the army during World War II, which contradicts his frequent assertion that he dislikes guns and doesn't know how to use them — but then again, his chosen method of suicide also contradicts this statement. In a very puzzling scene that's unconnected to virtually everything else in the film, Claude runs across an old man who, he claims, gave Claude fake documents and a new identity during the war. The old man protests that he doesn't remember Claude, and says that it's impossible, that he too got a new identity during the war. It's a very mysterious scene, suggesting that there's a lingering mystery in Claude's past, even in his identity. Is memory really so fragile, so malleable?

Reuters did a story on Monday’s edition of “The Daily Show” but never mentioned the vagina manger scene segment; it was picked up by the chicagotribune.com, msnbc.com, and Yahoo! Movies. Also reporting on this episode, but never citing the obscene segment were the following: the blog site of the latimes.com; gawker.com; huffingtonpost.com; theatlanticwire.com; talkingpointsmemo.com; thewrap.com; NBC-TV New York; and NBC-TV Chicago. Only mediaite.com and dailykos.com mentioned the offensive part.
Today's card is a very simple one. The card base is 5x7, the layer is 4.75x6.75. The DSP was so pretty that I didn't add any more images to it. I did take a stylus and dry embossed some of the area's to make it show up better but the photo doesn't give it justce. I also applied some dazzling diamonds to the center pods but it doesn't show up well either. I added the ribbon and the sentiment is again from Pink by Design. I am entering this card into the Totally Gorjuss challenge, they are asking for traditional Christmas colors. Anything Goes Challenge is emboss it. I did use the stylus to dry emboss so I think it should apply to this card. Elephantastic Challenge is make a card with a butterfly or a Christmas card.

Well, my daughter loves Lauren Child books and has ambitions to be an author herself, so when I saw that a local bookshop was holding the launch of Lauren's latest book "Look into my eyes" (about Ruby Redfort; Clarice Bean's favourite character) with food, a talk from Lauren and a signed copy of the book, I got straight on the phone and booked daughter and me a place.

So YAY for my first official "away from home" organizing trip! For my mom's birthday this year, one of the gifts I had given her was my organizational services for a day (or for like EVER since she IS my mom!). When I arrived this last Saturday, she gave me two options. Either help her remove her wallpaper border in her bedroom, or organize her bathroom and linen closet. Of course, I chose where my passion lays, organization!
Taking a minute to relax and shake out the bad mojo, I got a glass of water, stretched out my arms and got out a new pan. This time, I would put on some music, I thought to myself, to keep my mind of the minutes that were crawling by while I waited for the sugar to turn to caramel. Ever watch a huge pot of boiling water come to a boil? Imagine having to swirl the pot around at the same time…. tiring to think about? That’s what it feels like to throw a botched batch of caramel down the sink and start anew.
My Mum is in what I call her 'cake-loving' phase at the moment. She isn't a big cake eater (weird, right?) but she will randomly have cravings for certain cakes. Of course, I'm only too happy to cater to these cravings; which is exactly what I did today. You see, for the past few days she has purposely left this magazine out on the kitchen bench on the exact same page for me to see. Finally I looked at it today and noticed it was a recipe. Go figure. She had layed it out purposely for me in the hope that I would bake it to satisfy her craving. I think that this cake-cross-slice will definitely do the job. The texture is divine; so soft and moist. And the hint of cinnamon admist the carrot and apricot is such a good combination too.
"Brisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal. The beef brisket is one of the eight beef primal cuts. The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals. As cattle do not have collar bones, these muscles support about 60% of the body weight of standing/moving cattle. This requires a significant amount of connective tissue, so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderize the connective tissue."
Another example of Jim's larges is recounted in chapter 7 ("The Pink Pagoda is Born"), where Jim describes what allowed him to be successful (and protected) inside China:
Is this the standard we want our children to aspire to? Does the plethora of material riches, I mean crap, make them any happier? Don’t even answer that! What are these parents THINKING?

This is all fairly obvious but I feel there is reason to discuss this in a real sense. There are clear alternatives to each of these things but purely from a mental health point of view, there is very little reason to have such a massive number of people suffering with mental health conditions and therefore unable to work. The estimated cost to the British economy alone for depression is £11bn a year, including loss of earnings due to suicide and time off work with mood disorders and prescription of anti-depressant drugs on the NHS. While this would certainly not be completely removed by the implementation of a 20 or 30 hour working week, it would reduce this amount significantly. So, benefits there for all to appreciate.

In a huff, I headed out the door to try to remove my battery - when my daughter called. From the cell store. Where they wouldn't even talk to her without me present.
Next up, a work containing my favorite hitherto unencountered instrumentation: "tuned backyard", heard in duet with "double plugged equalizers". The backyard enters late in the piece (lovely sound wherein the effect of the tubes through which the locale is recorded can be clearly heard) but prior to that the piece engenders some serious throbbage. Similar, in a way, to the first track, one can be lured into simply succumbing to the richness and losing oneself in the sheer, gooey plasticity of the sound, but there's more going on: fluctuations within the drone, many more strands than were first apparent great depth. A fairly short, simple and pristine sine wave work, kind of a very slow melody, pure and beautiful, leads to the final work, imho the most powerful one presented here, for bass clarinet "with and without cardboard tubes". Again, an investigation, her into the lower, cloudy cavities of the instrument, the fluttering, pulsed tones like some black, subterranean river. The throb dwindles to a quaver or two, gorgeously paired. You can hear someone who's gone into the Malfatti zone and emerged from the other side, enhanced and "permitted" to more actively engage, the lessons having been well-learned. A fantastic piece, one I can and will listen to many, many times and a seriously fine recording overall. Not to be missed.
In February my husband and I will celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary and we have been interviewed by a national women's magazine which is writing a feature on the subject of marriage.
Merry Christmas to all, on this Christmas Day 2011. You might be today spending time with the family, exchanging Santa’s gifts and wondering why the Elf’s brought you the wrong gift. Or having a Christmas dinner and if you’re an NBA fan, watching the opening day of games. We have so much to be grateful for.
I do have a history of sexual abuse and rape which is all tied into the weight gain. I have not really used this blog as a place for personal purging, but I can't be authentic if I don't share that this is a HUGE (no put intended) part of my weight history. I know I am not alone either and I REFUSE to carry the shame and fear inside of me for ONE MORE DAY.
Then there's the more challenging patterns where I can plant my behind on the lounge sans children and strain the few brain cells that haven't become null and void due to firstly pregnancy, then breastfeeding and broken sleep (I really can't complain as the little man has slept through from 6:30 pm to around 7:00 am the last few nights!

Very affordable, long lasting and fits most walkers. These glide smoothly over most surfaces, including grass and cement. It will fit any 1 1/8” walker tubing. Please check it out at our site. Click here to view. To install you need to remove either the tennis balls or rubber tips from the rear legs of your walker. Now insert the glides into each of the legs with the raised lip on the glide facing to the front of the walker. Make sure each glide fits securely into place and use a screwdriver to tighten the screw on the bottom of each glide by turning it clockwise.

Learning new skills is also a piece of cake for these folks. A particular youngster that I know very well excels at playing strategy games like Khet, which is a game in which you shoot lasers at your opponent and you hope not to hit a mirrored piece, which causes the beam to bounce back and hit YOU, and this game, chess. He has had many, many troubles at school with things like impulse control and with learning to write legibly, but he has an unbelievable amount of focus when it comes to playing chess and, I have to say, he’s quite good at it.
The cooks also competitively watch to find out which dish is hit hardest for seconds and thirds.
I know shit about photography, and that was the first thing I thought, after the obligatory, “Oooh, sexy girl,” brain freeze. I wondered how much the model knew about photography either. It seems to be something that crops up in erotica/pornography; taking a picture of a cute girl taking a picture. I guess if you’re a photographer’s model, it probably pays to know something. And you probably pick stuff up by exposure (pun unintended, I assure you). But I just wondered exactly how much this woman really knew about photography. And the story kind of wrote itself. I wish I had more space, because hey, I could write more.
And this card uses the quatrefoil one again! I made the cards earlier in the week, and then I got the idea of using them and having them printed with my photos instead of printing them at home and pasting my printed, cropped photo on top. I saved a little paper and some ink. It all adds up, right?

The walk from the terminal to where the planes are takes about 5 minutes, and while it doesn’t happen often in southern California, it does rain every once in a while. These umbrellas are given as a courtesy by the airport when there’s a chance of rain so that you don’t board your flight soaked. It is not something you see everyday. If anyone has an upcoming trip to the west coast and can fly through Long Beach I would highly recommend it. The stress free security and boarding procedures are a far cry from the chaos that usually swallows LAX.

Yes and if really we could just plunge into this new world where there wasn’t school and jobs had been completely rerouted, I think that what we would see is that people would be starting their own companies a lot more-these things would be intertwined in a new way –but only new in the sense that it was widespread because, again, we are already seeing that things are moving in that direction.

I was a little thrown off by the history lessons. Then I realized how much the book really was about the history. It almost became one of the characters itself.

The restaurant was designed so that the ice cream was displayed at the entrance (ala Baskin Robbins) and the fountain boy was in full display in his white shirt, black pants, red paisley vest, and the, always stylish, red white and blue paper hat (Gandhi style). The job required showmanship, artistry, speed, and an incredibly strong wrist and forearm. I loved it! Especially Friday nights as the local high school football games ended and we were overrun with ice cream loving teenagers. Showtime! Tom Cruise had nothing on me (well, except for the looks and Nicole Kidman).
“The money power preys on the nation in times of peace, and conspires against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, more selfish than bureaucracy.

Twenty five years of being married is a milestone that is worthy of celebration.

Nothing! Your first response should not be to leap into action–whether that be in defense of yourself or an offensive means of making changes that will better align yourself with the expectations of the person who is critiquing you. All critiques, to be properly handled, should be patiently evaluated and discerningly digested. These things spell time, which most of us don’t want to give to personal criticisms, but we must not neglect these measures or we will miss the blessing that is it be slowly squeezed out of them.
The end of the year is a great time for a bit of a review of the year’s achievements and experiences, the highs and the lows. It’s a time to celebrate and consolidate before leaping into the new year.

Nazario Moreno, who was reported killed in December 2010 in a shootout with government forces, is still alive and remains at the head of the Caballeros. The same claim was made by a captured Mexico City gang boss last year, and previously in posters signed by the Familia. Given that his death was a major success for the government and precipitated the collapse of the Familia, this allegation would be a bombshell if it proved true. Such conspiracy theories are common in Mexico. One popular tall tale is that Amado Carrillo, the Juarez Cartel founder who died in plastic surgery in 1997, faked his own death and remains at large. Anabel Hernandez, in her muckraking 2011 book “Los Señores del Narco,” claimed that the deceased Sinaloa boss Ignacio Coronelwas also still alive. There’s not much evidence to support any of these allegations, and there’s little reason to believe any of them are accurate.

If you will put your trust completely in Me, says the Lord, you will experience true unity. This is a season when you will no longer stretch up as on your tiptoes to try to understand revelation or to see and discern as an external exercise. Rather, you will become one with Me as I am one with My Father, and you will know spiritual reality-not as something to be received or attained, but as a result of being joined to My heart. It will be the overflow of intimacy.

Sven started out fast and stayed fast, it also looked for most of the race like Jan would stay ahead of Jonathan – and with every lap that passed John’s neighbor leaned over and shouted “one, two, three! Sorry!” But with three laps to go, Jan’s splits began to creep over 30 seconds, and at two laps to go, John’s neighbor left off his constant refrain. And then it was over – Sven won by a wide margin, Bob placed second, and Jan couldn’t hold on – Jonathan had won 3rd place, which is his first-ever individual championship medal!

I graduated high school ten years ago. That's just crazy to me... I remember when they would ask us in high school... where do you see yourself in ten years?? I'd have to say, I'm very happy and content with where I am in life. I found an amazing partner and best friend in Eric, I have some great friends, some who have come in and out of my life but I'm thankful for the good times we shared, and some that have come back in within the last few years and I couldn't be happier and luckier to have them. We have a beautiful house we've made our home, a loving and sometimes a little crazy rescued dog, and of course... we have a sweet baby (ok, toddler?!) girl that I definitely couldn't imagine ever living without.
Diagnosis is usually made by learning the history of a cold that is followed by hoarseness. The throat usually appears red and somewhat swollen. Listening to the chest, neck, and back with a stethoscope (an instrument used to hear heart and lungs sounds) may reveal some harsh wheezing sounds when the person breathes.

Thank god I did because the second season of Parks eclipsed the fairly mediocre first season. Not only is it the funniest sitcom on NBC outshining The Office, 30 Rock and Community, but it also it has one of the funniest characters in television history with Ron fucking Swanson.

There is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express. No trace of these translations remain, not even the name of the journal for which they were intended. In April 1951, he also translates The “Sacred” Speech of Hölderlin collected in The Work of Fire and complains of the “very badly translated” extracts from Heidegger. The same applies. That same month Molloy was published and was nominated for the Prix des Critiques, for which Blanchot was a judge. He supported the novel “without reservation” and tried to persuade the jury to award it the prize. Beckett’s partner Suzanne wrote to Jérôme Lindon that “[to] have been defended by a man like Blanchot is the main thing for Beckett, whatever the outcome”. In 1954, when Peter Suhrkamp was preparing a journal dedicated to Beckett and requested French reviews, Beckett told him that the those by Maurice Nadeau and Georges Bataille were the best “but the big thing, for me, is the recent piece by Maurice Blanchot”. He means “Where Now? Who Now?” published in the NNRF in October 1953. This is the extent of his comment, understandable given the formality of the letter, yet he doesn’t mention the review to more casual correspondents let alone responds to its analysis. If such reticence is not disingenuous, we may recognise a reason in Blanchot’s words:

I’ve heard this verse many times. One of those verses that turns into a cliché in your head and loses its true meaning in your life. Until I needed it. God has been speaking to me through scripture about this truth over and over again in different contexts. Whenever I am tempted to believe that happiness would come from having more things, more money, or even more money to GIVE, God reminds me that there is actually no difference at all between those who have more and those who have less. No matter how much you have or don’t have, it’s Godliness, combined with contentment that makes you wealthy.

Any time friends or family visit, I take them around Canterbury Cathedral. It is to Anglicans what Rome is to Catholics - the mother church, and seat of its head. But apart from its religious significance it is a great architectural gem with a fascinating history - in many ways the history of England is reflected in its walls in microcosm (Along with St. Martin's Church and St. Augustine's Abbey it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site). After a while I thought why not sign up to volunteer there since I practically live there anyway! I was on the waiting list for over a year before I was accepted on the assistant training course. By then I'd discovered I was pregnant but decided to do it anyway, bump and all, as I wasn't sure when I'd get the opportunity again. It was the most amazing experience - four months of lectures ranging from ecclesiastical history to the monarchs of England, monastic life to stained glass windows, through architecture down the ages and on to stone care of visitors. I loved every minute of it, despite an exam at the end! Now I'm on a two year probationary period after which I can train to be a Cathedral guide if I wish. The fabulous thing is that there are always ongoing lectures plus the Cathedral archives to explore in order to broaden your knowledge, so it is like an ever-expanding study module. I love the whole thing. Once a week I sling The Daughter on my front and stand around with a sash on, attempting to look friendly and approachable, answering any questions visitors might have (she just looks cute, or falls asleep).

Many times, the importance of the relationship among the grazing animal, the forage plants being grazed and the soil supporting the forage goes overlooked. This key relationship, known as the plant/animal interface, creates a dynamic ecosystem in pastures and rangeland grazing systems.
Before we begin on how to grab and post a blinkie or button on your blog we need to determine if you are using the Old Interface or the New Interface. How do you know? Well they look very different but are pretty much the same thing. So I have taken clips or screen shots of the different interfaces and will first show the new interface. If you are using the Old Interface scroll down.

Somewhere between 24 and 48 hours after getting Spooky, he started to exhibit a number of disturbing behavior traits including, but not limited to: a) climbing up door jambs like a lumberjack by bracing his back paws on the lintel and scooting up and down, b) hiding at the top of the door jamb until I walked by, then followed by c) dropping on my head. He varied this with following me around with his legs locked stiffly while letting out a high-pitched squeal just before lunging and biting my Achilles tendon hard enough to draw blood. The real question isn’t why he did these things but why I didn’t take him back to the crack house and return him to his real family.

In Turkey, capital taxation was imposed only on Jews in 1942. Iran confiscated Jewish possessions and real estate in 1979. Morocco held Jews, anxious to emigrate to Israel, for ransom in 1961, and the World Jewish Congress had to pay $250 for each Jew who was permitted to leave the country. In Tunisia, in 1961-1962, Jews who were leaving the country were allowed to take with them only one dinar (the equivalent today of three U.S. dollars). Yemen, in 1949, listed Jewish possessions and properties in order to hold them for ransom. In 1947, Syria discharged Jews from public service positions; in 1949, it seized Jewish financial assets.

If we cannot have direct access to what Beckett experienced in that time, it remains indirectly sensible. The anxious verve of the brilliant young writer is replaced by a quieter man, still gravely lyrical yet less prone to hyperbole, much more forgiving of third parties (unless it’s Alexander Trocchi) and more focused on writing, just writing. What makes the editors’ task particularly daunting (that is, in persuading the executors to publish) is Beckett’s reluctance to discuss the detail of his work. When he does mention what he has written, he is excessively dismissive. So, rather than offer a review of the letters, I want to focus on this apparent oddity.
So upon John's return from Vegas, my ever-so-sweet mother decided to treat the entire family to dinner at her favorite restaurant, Buca di Beppo. In addition to this, my amazing brother Robby bought us a pitcher of Bohemian Brewery's Viennese Lager (easily one of Utah's best beers). Now, what's most interesting about this night is there was some confusion as to what we were actually celebrating. You see, I had just returned from a week in a psych unit. Not something I would usually think to celebrate. John had returned from a comedy tour that took him to Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Las Vegas, Nevada. He had made some money on this trip, but spent virtually all of it on his airfare home. The best thing about this is that he ended up missing his flight, wasting the ticket, and getting a ride home from a most charitable friend.

Giving in to the temptation of a perkier model doesn't make Trump a bad man. But it doesn't make him a good one, either. This is what used to be known - quaintly - as "the character question". A man's character doesn't interest modern culture that much any more. Bulk media prefer narcissism and self-expression to doing the right thing and selflessness. Unfortunately, where television dwells, so go the people. Mostly, anyway.

According to AS, Madrid is now going for what will be a record 100 points (at the moment, they have 88, which means they have to win all four of the remaining games to set a new record), which would beat Barça’s 99 points record, set in the 2009-10 season. In addition, Madrid could set the new record for the most number of wins, which would be 32. The team is currently at 28, and has a shot at beating the record set by Barça and Madrid of 31 wins in the 2009-10 season. In addition, Madrid has beaten every single other team in the Liga at once, the 12th time that’s happened in Liga history. Plus, the team could also set the record for most number of away wins. At the moment, they’re at 14, which ties with last season’s Barça for the top mark. Madrid has two more road games, at Athletic and Granada.

Ah yes! Mary Crawford. I never could understand why Jane Austen eventually painted her as a villainess (or semi-villainess) in “MANSFIELD PARK”. As the sister of Henry Crawford, she shared his tastes for urbane airs, tastes, wit (both tasteful and ribald) and an interest in courtship. She also took an unexpected shine to the shy Fanny Price, while falling in love with the likes of Edmund Bertram. However, Edmund planned to become a clergyman, something she could not abide. Mary was not perfect. She could be superficial at times and a bit too manipulative for her own good. If I must be honest, she reminds me too much of Dolly Levi, instead of a woman of low morals. Here are the actresses who portrayed Mary Crawford:

So watch out for the term "social justice". The government does not need to get involved with what the church does, as it will destroy our abilityto be the church.

Chapter 29: “Put-That-There” by Richard Bolt was simply about human-computer interaction and how computer interfaces were being created to recognize not only voice but facial gesutres as well.

Bolt and a research team at MIT set up a Meida Room that used dimensional scress to allow a view into simulated three dimensional spaces as well as a humans placed in the actual room. This showed how the user of a computer could experience both spatial data and data in two demensional spaces at the same time. This suggest that the computer would be programmed to understand the basic of humman communication.

Salmon aquaculture, also known as salmon “farming”, is the industrial mass production of salmon. Farmed salmon are raised in net cages located in the ocean close to shore. Disease and parasites tend to multiply quickly in these densely populated feedlots. Because of this, farmers have to feed caged fish large quantities of antibiotics and pesticides. Residues of these chemicals are passed to the humans who eat farmed fish. This contributes to “superbugs” that can resist antibiotics in people, and these chemicals can cause cancer, high blood pressure, strokes, immune-system problems and reproductive disorders.

Once SIL#3 picked Kara up I was off to get the errands done for the week (I hate traffic) I didn't get to the post office in time but I think I can manage on Monday since I will only have Mason Man for the day.

Just when I have my "Room of Sin" all nice and organized I drag in an additional bag of fabric..... No regrets, this stuff is cute! I also bought a pattern to work up the new fabric but as luck would have it when I sat down tonight to study it the package is missing the last page. I have the worst luck buying patterns, something always seems to be missing. Monday I will see if the store will e-mail me a copy of the last page, with gas up to $3.79 a gallon I don't want to make another trip out unless I have to.
And here’s one more cool secret about Polaris. It has a companion that just happens to be quite dim – magnitude 9. It’s fun to see the two of them if you have a small telescope, though it’s not all that easy because Polaris is so much brighter than its companion. But if you get a chance to see Polaris and its companion in a telescope, remind yourself that the very faint companion is still a bit brighter than our Sun would look at this distance. This companion, known as Polaris B, was discovered in 1780 by William Herschel, and for many years Polaris was thought to be a binary star – that is, a system of two stars orbiting about a common center of gravity. But Polaris was holding one more surprise – it’s really a triple star.

When we went into Barcelona last week we discovered a Christmas market in front of the old cathedral in the Gothic Quarter. Most of the stalls were selling nativity scene mangers and all the figurines that go with it. Apparently, this is a major form of Christmas decoration in Spain. They do Christmas trees here also, but its the nativity scene that they can go all out with. This is because it is not just the manager scene like is popular back home. Here it extends to the entire village of Bethlehem so it can be a major production to recreate all the pastures and town of Bethlehem. In the stalls they were selling moss that is used for the pastures, and some stalls sold all the buildings, i.e. mangers, farmhouses, inns, etc. Many of these buildings came complete with little (working) water fountains, and flickering battery powered lanterns, etc. And some stalls sold the figurines. It was actually not that easy to find the central figures (Mary, Joseph, Jesus, Angel, cradle) because I guess most people already have those. It’s all the outlying characters that people can really add to every year to create bigger and better “Beléns”.
After all, if the DA's decision was met by unfounded hysteria, surely the media - the public's bulwark against sensation and misrepresentation - would sift through the rhetoric and report to the public only those facts salient to it? Perhaps not.
* We started formal Bible studies this semester...so far, both are working well. Studying God's Word by Christian Liberty Press...Morgan is studying the book of Acts. Raegan and Robyn stories of the Old Testament. The little girls' study involves scissors, glue, and crayons...another thing that makes them happy. During our study of the Flood, we added some general knowledge in as we researched rainbows and learned several new vocabulary words from our box of 96 crayons in searching for the exact colors that are suppose to be in a rainbow!
Of course there are many advantages to drawing digitally; it is so much easier to erase; no clean up needs to be done in order to use as line art in digital projects and the list goes on.

So, when? A while, looks like. Meanwhile, as was the backup plan, Kehoe is having two beers -- one being Philly Pale (the other I can't remember: ESA? IPA?) -- brewed under contract at The Lion. The other beers will be coming from stocks built up at the Kensington brewery, which is now, of course, Philadelphia Brewing (which has some interesting session-looking beers up on their 'coming soon' brews list).

But life is full of enjoyable things. As a friend said the other day, “It seems that life doesn’t want you to be quiet right now”. At least being ill forced me to lie in bed, sleep and read. Bliss. Perhaps I should try and aim for a rather better balance - the thing is, there are many lovely people to meet up with and so many interesting things to do….. And let’s face it, life has been somewhat short of Fun over the last few years.

I also came to realize that I can be proud of the unique childhood experience I received from my family. It has made me who I am. It has taught me some important lessons: that despite whatever obstacles one encounters in life, one should never give up – and that love is best experienced when it’s given liberally and unconditionally.

The government’s budget has been at the center of all previous shutdowns, and the 2011 budget battle is not different. A budget (annual appropriation bills) needs to be passed by Congress and signed by the President prior to the commence of the new fiscal year on October 1, or continuing resolutions also known as stopgap spending bills need to be passed to keep the government operating at the prior year’s fiscal spending limits. However, if Congress fails to pass the appropriation bills, a continuing resolution, or the President vetoes or does not sign the resolution; these results in a government shutdown as there are no funds allocations to operate government.
The brewery/monastery has gone through a bit in the last thousand years. It was burned to the ground completely on four occasions between 1085 and 1463, was depopulated by three plagues and crumbled under an earthquake. Despite furious devastating raids by the Huns, the Swedes, the French and even their own Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian, those tenacious Benedictines not only refused to be beaten, but they also managed to perfect the art of brewing and improve their techniques each time they rebuilt. Good on them!

In 2011 I felt thankful that I could even finish; but this year I was not content with just dragging across the line. I led the first mile, which felt awesome, but secretly I knew I couldn’t keep that pace. During the second mile 2 women slipped past me, but that was all. 28:04; not the pace I was hoping for, but having recovered from a hip problem in March when I couldn’t train at all I probably shouldn’t really complain.
Soft Opening II featuring.... Backstitched: The Embroidered Comics of Dee Clements
In recent years central Port Elizabeth has suffered from decentralization which has resulted in urban decay. The Nelson Mandela municipality is currently funding numerous urban renewal projects which have seen the installation of open-air artworks; renovation of old buildings and the commemoration of historical landmarks, with hopes that it will re-ignite economic development and draw more tourists to share in its history. However, for me, there’s something fascinating in dilapidated buildings and their almost-forgotten architecture.
Having accomplished so much during her freshman year, Alyssa is certainly on her way to fulfilling her dream of becoming a pediatric pulmonologist. The ThanksUSA team wishes Alyssa continued academic success and we encourage her and all other college-bound military dependents and spouses to apply for the 2012-2013 ThanksUSA Scholarship. Applications are being accepted through May 15th and complete details can be found here. We conclude this week’s Scholarship News with a few words of thanks from Alyssa:
Critical Examination: A very quick read, with a lot of historical research, very well done. The setting is described well and the conditions Beetle had to endure were accurate with the time period. I’m amazed at both how much and how little people of this era new about pregnancy and childbirth.While the cover of this book seems to be geared toward children, it is NOT a child’s book. Childbirth and pregnancy (in medieval times) are covered in detail and are not pretty. The author includes a helpful closing note explaining medieval midwifery practices (“a combination of common sense, herbal knowledge, and superstition”).
Although I have always loved City Island, I never liked seafood. I was probably one of the few people who went to a restaurant on the Island and didn't order fish. Like I said, what I loved was the water and the boats. The ocean calms me and not many things can do that! When I am on the water, I feel free and to me, nothing is more beautiful than when the sky meets the ocean creating a sense of infiniteness to the universe. And as I got older, I did learn to appreciate that romantic atmosphere and had my own share of dates there.

What this basically means is that $940 billion number in the CBO report that the Democrats are cheering over is entirely subjective. It would have been a lot higher if they had included the stuff they should have included. And they didn’t include these things simply because it would have made their number look bad. It’s Alice in Wonderland accounting.
Finally for today's power pop skim over comes this 'un, an album that was hot off the presses in '77 yet a flea market find in '82! Yes, here's none other than the first platter from the Chicago-area power poppers who were roamin' under the name Pezband! Like many of you, I remember the press this group, who were actually signed to the Passport record label, best known for importing progressive rockers like Nektar over to these shores as well as signing some of the local proggy home grown acts like Larry Fast's Synergy, had garnered back in the late-seventies. Heck, I even remember all of the stories about 'em in the pages of BOMP! and TROUSER PRESS which gave me the impression that Pezband must have had a mighty good press on their side if they could get all of the boffo print that they were sure grabbing up! And true these guys were just one of the many fine outta nowhere acts that made up the musical vocabulary of the seventies, but when this generation of music got washed away by the time of post-disco wave fluffy metal giddiness a few years later, didn't you shed a tear even though you were one of those sophistacados who thought they were nothin' but Raspberries whitewash?
Thanks for checking back. Things are moving along nice and steady. Our priority is obviously Aaron in all of this and it's been quite a month for him. We've been taking small steps with the refurbishment so as not to overwhelm him.
I was so curious when I saw the teaser photo of this MV, but then when I watch it I became so amazed. And now I so excited to know where and how she shoot the MV. At first I think this MV is so weird, you know, to see the singer covered with mud and then crying and you don’t know why did she alone in that desert. Finally when I saw the volcano, then I begin to realize it’s about an apocalypse, and she is about to DIE. OHMAIGWOT!!
Here is a video of the boys playing with the Dog Casino.
Not many people can say their entire existence has been one big lab experiment: poked and prodded by scientists, genetically modified to be the best and endure the worst, subjected to daily tests and trials that would kill a normal human. All Michaela wants is her own life, to be able to go to school, flirt with boys, maybe eat ice cream now and then. So when the chance to escape finally comes, Michaela and her sister grab it, taking their friends with them.
2) When we got to school this morning, Wonder Boy slipped or something as he was getting out of his seat and somehow ended up face-down, wedged between the floorboard and the back seat. I did not know it was possible to get stuck in this way. At first I thought he was clowning around, but he became increasingly panicked and I ended up pulling him out by his legs.
I got home from Seinäjoki 4.20 am, I had to be at work at 8 am. It was a interesting working day to sayt a least! But the trip was totally worth it and the shitloads of money it took XD Now I'm totally broke, thank god tomorrow is payday.

There was a massive amount of water running down the side of the mountain on this day. I decide to follow the drainage as long as possible and see how many other falls were running. 3 miles and nearly 15 falls later I finally started making my way back up the mountain. I’d hit the waterfall jackpot. I found one every few hundred feet it seemed. I probably took over a 100 pictures that day. It was one of the more riskier hikes I’d taken due to everything being slick as snot and having to climb up and down bluffs all day.
Chalmers Ashby Johnson (August 6, 1931 – November 20, 2010) was an American author and professor emeritus of the University of California, San Diego. He served in the Korean War, was a consultant for the CIA from 1967–1973, and chaired the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of California, Berkeley from 1967 to 1972. He was also president and co-founder of the Japan Policy Research Institute (now based at the University of San Francisco), an organization promoting public education about Japan and Asia. He wrote numerous books including, most recently, three examinations of the consequences of American Empire: Blowback, The Sorrows of Empire, and Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic. For a brief period in the 1960s, Chalmers Johnson was a RAND consultant.
Those of us who consider ourselves witches base our spirituality around Mother Earth and all aspects of nature. We are the stewards of the earth which the goddess calls upon to teach and remind people that we must treat her with respect and live in harmony with her or we will lose her and all of life as we know it.

In the meantime I returned to work driving over the road again and tried to move on with my life. My family and friends moved on with their lives. I talked less and less about my experience with cancer. I felt like my family was uncomfortable with me talking to others about it. I started keeping it all inside and not telling others my story afraid I might offend someone. I even had someone say that all I had to do was get it cut out and get over it. This was a nurse saying this. I had people looking away from me when they found out I was a survivor. I felt and still feel like people are afraid of me.

After the Kesch-Hütte, the way leads to Platta Naira (2397 m ASL), so that was another 235 m straight down. The scenery was kinda ugly, I usually see this in movies like Cliffhanger: Rocks all over, creeks and the path sharing the same way, fog, clouds, rain, cold. And the height.
This beer pours a very deep copper/amber hue with a small head that left spotty lacing on my glass. The smell on this beer is really surprising for a regular IPA, and the notes are very clear while pouring this beer. I get loads of fresh citrus fruit with grapefruit, oranges, passion fruit, and peaches dominating with just a touch of spice and pine in the background. It has quite a bit of punch for a regular IPA. The flavor profile is a bit more subdued with the caramel malt coming in upfront before making way to all those citrus flavors, but along with the other citrus fruits I noted in the nose I am also picking up some lemon zest on the palate. The mouthfeel is very crisp with medium carbonation, and I do not really detect much alcohol on the mouthfeel. This is one of the best balanced IPAs that I've had the pleasure of drinking.

Same in the taste, but without the wheat zip. The raspberry just drags it down.
Not going to lie, I did not read these instructions. That would explain why I have an extra plastic piece left over whose purpose is an absolute mystery to me. It would also explain why I put the rocks in before the bottom piece. Or why I struggled with the air tube.

At the age of 60 she retired from govt. service and was just picking up the loose ends of her life when my father fell ill. For the next 10 years it was a test of her mettle and took a toll on her health but even in those adverse circumstances she never gave up.
It seems that our favorite super rich man, Mitt Romney, was quick and emphatic about offering his support and defense of the 2008 Wall Street bailout. He credited President Bush for acting to avert an economic depression…that is an economic depression for his rich folk colleagues, buddies and business partners.
I have no intention of stopping or even slowing down in beer journalism and blogging, and there may also be other books – more conventional style drinks books – in the offing. But all the ideas I’ve had for narrative, story-driven, personal journey type books in beer feel like they subscribe to the law of diminishing returns. If I ever reach the stage where tens of thousands of people are prepared to buy a book just because it has my name on the cover, I'll definitely revisit various ideas for more epic beer journeys, but at the moment there's simply not a big enough market to justify the expense and time commitment they require.

JP lives in NYC, and this recipe is from one of his favorite restaurants, Shiok. It’s tangy because of lime juice, salty due to fish sauce, and sweet from coconut milk. We also added soba noodles, boiled in the stock, for a heartier meal. Make this instead of chicken noodle soup and you’ll never look back.
“It has been the same theme, hitting the crossbar, people clearing it off the line, us missing chances or hitting our own players. The lads are playing well enough so I can’t complain about their effort or spirit. It’s difficult for them to take but it’s great credit that it doesn’t seem to be knocking them down.”
I would like to read someday an ending memoir by Karen, reflecting on her life perhaps from the end of the book to that day. She has a way of telling stories that is a gift. And indeed the book is a gift to us, far more than I could write here. One we need in a day in which counting the cost is little understood, and even less practiced. But with an end through God’s grace in Jesus which can give us all hope.
Rondebosch Common
Clink! A chain was wrapped around me as though it were a sash. Clink! Another chain wrapped itself around my waist, pinning my arms to my sides. The dark ones moved in closer, whispering things in my head. I felt ensnared by my life, as though each decision I had made was another chain around my body, another dark one following me around. I knew I would be doomed in this hell for eternity! I had no way of escape and no one to help me. Tears began to stream down my face. If only I had listened to my pastor when I was still a teenager. If only I had gone to college instead of partying my life away. If only I had done this or that. If only, if only. I had dug my way into a pit that was impossible to climb out of. I wanted to cry for help but I still couldn’t breathe. Who could save me from this…my life?
But, nevertheless, I hope to not disappoint anyone! :) I’m hoping by next Sunday I’ll have it finished. But finals are coming up and I’m studying hard! Keep your fingers crossed for me! :D

All seems very clear, doesn’t isn’t. In fact there isn’t one aspect of the Principles that isn’t being trashed in numerous instances by the aforementioned fascists. (if you think my referring to the US/UK Military-Industrial-Parliamentary/Congressional Complex as fascists, think about the definition of fascism said to have been made by Mussolini: ‘Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power,’ and check back for a following post which will provide more information and research sources on the issue.)

I'll actually be back with some mini-reviews on Saturday. This Saturday, I promise. Expect at least one review of these TODAY releases: THE PREDICTEDS by Christine Seifert, WITCH SONG by Amber Argyle, and ASHES by Ilsa J. Bick -- happy book birthday! I'm also considering reviewing SIRENZ and CHAIN REACTION. If you really want a review of any of these, let me know. :)
She was so excited to be able to go down the slide! The bottom had a bit of leftover rain or melted hail, which she asked me to wipe off. Then we had to check the other two slides. Yup, they both had water at the bottom too. Ok, not a big deal to swish the water off. Back to the big blue slide she runs, climbs up the ladder and down. Laughing.

Carrot and raspberry swirl cupcakes are relatively modest in appearance, if slightly oversized beneath their dollops of buttercream frosting (“Mini” cupcakes, about the size you’d bake at home, are also available). But what Crumbs does really well is inventive and irresistible flavors. Reese’s Peanut Butter, Fluffernutter, S’Mores and Banana Split are just a few of the 25+ options, many of which are topped with chunks of candy and drizzled in chocolate.

It’s not like Beard Papas are now barren. Locals come in to buy them by the dozen, and tourists stand around, pondering whether to get the classic vanilla cream puff, or to go with the daily flavor, like chocolate or strawberry. All in all, it’s a Willy Wonka-ish experience, in a wacky Japanese sort of way. Great fun.

Recently I read an internet discussion on how much “grace” we should preach. You know, as opposed to preaching the life of the kingdom, the demands of discipleship, missional living, that kind of thing. One side said they’d like to see more grace, another side said they’d like to see less.
Bill Maher should have to face some consequences for his misogynist language, but he's on HBO, so there aren't any sponsors to boycott. Women probably should stop being guests on his show. Or go on his show and crotch-punch him or something. But before you start in with the whole "Bill gets away with saying shit because he's supposedly a 'liberal'" or whatever, may I remind you that Bill has already been kicked off TV once for a controversial comment.

Direction in this regard is solid and scenes are well-staged: when Arisu is disoriented we get POV shots that whirl around. When his trysts with Kayako are shown it is from a voyeuristic view. Although I complained about the film being derivative I bought the differences between the sequences taking place in Darkland and the bland reality Arisu holds onto.
And lastly, we had apples dipped in honey, a tradition that symbolizes a sweet year ahead for you. In reality, we had run out of apples, so we had pears from my parents' pear tree and garden. Cooked slightly and dipped in honey, they were delish!

The right place is where it passes unnoticed, is part of the action, and helps the story progress. Too many of us think that cutting exposition is about cutting text. What I learned from writing this novel is that it's about putting it in the right place.

The commercial banks in the CBD spend substantial sums each month on private security guards spreading many blocks from their immediate premises to improve the safety of their staff and the public.

For the next two days, I continued weeding and trimming enjoying both the physical relief and the satisfaction of seeing the garden’s form revealed. I contemplated how I might be weeding and trimming the mind at the same time. Indeed, while I was doing it I thought about many things, but I was increasingly able to observe rather than just get carried away with stressful kinds of thinking. I should add that we had also agreed that I had permission not to think about work at all for the week. One way of seeing this was that it had engineered a pattern interruption.
2. The Omega Man (1971) – Charlton Heston stars as the “last” man on Earth after a virus has killed almost everyone and turned the rest into zombies that are a cross between Hippies and black robe wearing members of the Church of Satan. There is a lot to like about this movie – Heston driving through an abandoned Los Angeles and going to the movies (why would you sit in the dark when that’s where the zombies live?); Heston’s home with a balcony where he can give speeches to the zombies; the hot woman who Heston has sex with before she turns into a zombie (remember, he is that last man – not last human); the ritual/torture scene in the middle of a football stadium; and Anthony Zerbe as the news anchor turned zombie leader.

Many congratulations to Fathers James Bradley and Daniel Lloyd, who were ordained into the sacred priesthood on Saturday, 21 April - St Anselm's Day. Both men were ordained to serve as priests for the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham.
Hinduism reveres many female deities: Lakshmi, Saraswati, Parvati, Shakti. But only at Kali's temple in Calcutta are bulls still ritually sacrificed to appease the divine bloodlust. Cybele -- the Phrygian import known to the Romans as Magna Mater -- took up almost half the programme's running time. Much was made of the Galli, the eunuch priests of the goddess who would castrate themselves in a state of ecstatic devotion and thereafter wear women's clothing. Much too was made of the taurobolium, the literal bloodbath (or blood-shower, I suppose) in which the worshipper stood beneath a grating above which a bull was being slaughtered. Very primal. But also, in terms of classical goddess worship, extremely atypical.
Like a dream come true, Father could now afford to provide his family with life’s little luxuries like nice clothing, fine food and vacation abroad.
The orders, his ninth and tenth since taking office in January, will force the state’s 4,000 daycare providers to add over $1 million in dues to union coffers, and remove the right to secret ballot election for these workers by instituting a card check process.
Quite often I've had things happen to me that I regretfully realise would not work in a piece of fiction, because the coincidence is too unlikely or the story is almost too neat. It's fine to use real life events and people as inspiration, but it's not a justification or a defence when people don't believe it.
Other than that there's not much new. I'll post more belly pics in a couple weeks. I still feel silly taking them since most of my gut is attributed to the pregnancy bloat, which has blown all my expectations out of the water. hahaha. My non prego pants are a thing of the past and most of my regular shirts are already looking a tad to short. It's ridiculous haha :) Oh well bring it on!
We should be wary, however, of the strong emphasis during this transitional process on the personal integrity of public officials. The way people around here tend to describe things, previous governments were venal and corrupt because the ministers named to them were immoral individuals who never received proper upbringing. Not enough Malians appreciate the extent to which bad governance stems from institutional rather than individual factors. Personal integrity is well and good, but in the absence of effective institutional controls, even upstanding individuals can achieve little in the fight against corruption.
Wedding insurance is essential. You're insuring against mainly an act of God, like you're venue going on fire, or London flooding. It is cheap to take out, and it will put your mind at rest. My first piece of advice is trust no one but the best with your wedding day, your chances of something going wrong decrease hugely along with your blood pressure levels.
Carving initials reminds me of high school when some dull educator droned on about something and all I wanted to do was to ever last my memory on the once proud tree, carving ones initials is not for elected officials that are bored and tired as if in algebra class just praying for the bell. I bet the knuckleheads in the volunteer state that punched that name on the ballot are now wanting to punch themselves for voting the former Hooters waitress to the State House of Representatives. Nothing wrong with being a Hooters waitress, I myself have helped many of them get through college with my love of their wings and generous portions of fries and not to mention their colorful and eye catching costumes.

When I'm not writing I'm thinking about writing, or reading. I try and counter-balance this physical inertia by walking in the mountains or riding my friend's horse. (That sounds very self indulgent but now at fifty plus, I finally have the time to be!)

This would bring your life back into a more balanced state. It would also assist you in acknowledging your feeling side – your Higher Self. You are all moving into your natural state of being, of reading events and inter-actions a different way. Not just from your eyes, that which you can physically see and hear. But from an energetic level. Everything on Earth has an energetic field. Everything. The animals, plants, the mountains, streams and rivers, the insects, the minerals, mankind, even your table and chairs. All are linked through this energetic field.
I find option three the most fun, a turnover drill. Jeff Galloway’s method would be best for a beginner and would prevent injury since it allows the body to recover. Here is the drill as written on his website:
There is a great wisdom in this book. There are many lines I simply read over and over again. Including, "You may be in one of many places, but none of them is where you started." Such an important line for this book, because even if Aubrey does feel "stuck" there is a knowledge she cannot escape and a world around her that keeps moving, so it is, in fact, impossible to hang on to the past in the way that she wishes. I also loved how expertly Ms. LaFleur conveyed to us the beauty of a family relationship with just one glance at an old photograph, "If you wanted to split us all up, you couldn't, because you couldn't tear just one of us out of the picture without ripping someone else."
Then theirs the simple economic question the President fails to understand. To be fair, it’s one of those really tough Econ-101 principles. Supply and Demand. The President seems to think we need to place more importance on education and fails to realize it’s already the biggest consideration and as such college enrollments have increased accordingly. The more people who want to go to college, the more demand there is and when there is more demand, the price goes up. Therefore it’s safe to assume that by giving more money away by the billions to help even more people go to college isn’t in fact going to help the situation.

But I did want to tell you a few things that have me pretty excited.
I shot this through the window of a NYC taxicab at 60th & Broadway by Columbus Circle. I went to the city to have lunch with friends and to celebrate someone’s birthday. I didn’t get home until around 8 pm, in plenty of time to watch one of my favorite shows on television: Downton Abbey.

We then meet Major General Scobie, who acts as UNIT's liaison with the regular army, when he refers to Liz Shaw as a pretty face, Katie disagrees. We then get a bit of a comic turn from Pertwee where we see him enter a door in the hospital marked "Doctors only," he has a shower and grabs an actual Doctor's foppish garb for himself.
The guy, who tuned out to be the cook, was a bit disappointed when I chose sambar-anna over chicken or fish. But he was pleasant enough, the sort who move from one tourist hotspot to another depending on the season; he’d been at Gokarna last, he said. The owner arrived later and he too was nice, but by now the general impression I made was that of a freak, or at least that’s what it seemed like to me. Until I was in the ghats the people had been kinder, on an average more pleasantly intrigued by my trip. Now the intrigue was giving way to skepticism and a strange wariness. The questions too taking on the tone of, why would you want to do such a thing?
My daughter may visualise them as flittering winged creatures, akin to angels, and princesses (and cats, in some surreal way. She’s 4). That’s her reality and who am I to stomp all over it with my Gortex boots.

Have you ever reviewed the origin of the word “God?” All references to the English word “God” reference back to the Old Irish word for “voice” and further back to a Sanskrit word for the linguistic archetype “Indra” of Hinduism.
- Ad hominem is bad. Ad hominem attacks are where you attack the person, and not the argument. If you can’t pick apart the argument being made, don’t go after the person. It makes you look stupid. If your response to my point about how everyone deserves a fair trial is to attack me personally, you’ve lost. You’ve got no point to make, and you’re just embarassing yourself. With that in mind…

Just a few weeks ago you had to get your shots. You weighed about 24 pounds. When Dr. C was checking your heart and lungs, you sat so still that I couldn't help but laugh. You just looked at her and didn't move. It was pretty cute. Allergies have really plagued you this month. Between runny noses, coughing, congestion and breathing treatments, you have had MANY a sleepless night. And so has your momma!

In an age when entertainment is less often derived from the natural environment, and the acquisition of culture almost entirely divorced from natural history, knowing the names of plants is a peccadillo not a pre-requisite of a shared civic curriculum. Gone are the days when Willis Linn Jepson (the great Californian botanist) could reasonably proclaim that "every educated person should know, at least broadly, the native forests, shrubs and flowering plants in his own state". But is it unreasonable that Californians should at least recognize their state flower, the poppy, rather than mistake it, as did a recent visitor to our property, for a buttercup?

I, as well as the recent research, strongly believe that nurture, and not so much nature, will determine how she'll be. Let's hope we measure up.
To stop the hunter and save those she loves, she must uncover the truth about her origins, keep a certain handsome cop from suspecting her of crimes she may have committed, and unleash the tremendous power locked inside of her without becoming what she fears most: a killer.

The boys were happily opening presents until they came to the Wii Madden NFL game. Upon opening it, they ran to the basement, not to be heard from again for hours! They (and I) have also enjoyed the new Wii Super Mario Brothers. Its fun to play with them instead of against them in a game.

I adore this product! I can safely say that this is in fact my favorite out of all the product I have tried. It enhances the absorption of the next skin care product that I apply on to my skin. I am currently using the second bottle in my skin care routine. The only downside about this product is that each bottle only lasts about 3 - 4 months. The pump is also annoying as it uses a dropper to take out products. However, if you are looking to purchase anything from Naruko, definitely try this out!
If I was going to point to an element of Islamic divorce law that Islam probably invented, it would be the right of khul, and even the wider concept that the dowry should rightly belong to the wife. Although this is how dowry is often defined in other traditions, more often it was paid to the wife’s family (or sometimes even the husband), and served as, effectively, a bride price. The right to own property, even in marriage, is fairly unusual, even well into the early modern period in the West, so Islam was definitely ahead of the curve on that one.
MW: That’s not true. When I learned that One United Bank was seeking help, I said to Frank that One United is one of your constituents (the bank is headquartered in Frank’s state Massachusetts) so you should take a look at this. He said “you’re right, they are my constituents, stay out of it, I’ll take a look at what One United is requesting.” That was said before the TARP bailout even came into existence.

“The size and scope of this misconduct — stretching to far-away islands never before having standing as approved United States Bank affiliates — is remarkable and emblematic of what we have seen,” he continued. “The bank crisis represents the height of corruption and brazen behavior where our historically trusted financial institutions have no qualms about breaking the law, because they have the Administration behind them. Banks do well enough when they operate lawfully without needing to be permitted to operate as criminal enterprises that steal money from United States citizens.”
That night I went to a concert at the new Catholic church in downtown Houston, with another mutual friend and her teenaged daughter. The friend was also my doula. Afterwards we went for a yogurt with yummy toppings.
But then I started feeling a bit left out. A mother put up an ad on the school notice board advertising a ‘Book Club for American Moms’ which offended every other nationality, and was unofficially deemed to have breached the international ethos of the school. In the discussions which followed, it turned out that nearly everyone was in their own Book Club. Feeling a little left out turned into raging paranoia. Why wasn’t I in a Book Club? Why didn’t someone invite me?

Bellies full, beer in hand, it was time to cool off in the pool and create the master plan for our short time here. Chatting, reflecting, we suddenly heard a loud howl the echoed overhead. We stopped, looked at each other, immediately thinking the same thing. Monkeys. All wide-eyed, we began speculating what this repeating call could be and speculated, whether we were right or not, we just heard howler monkeys. It was decided right then that hearing these guys was going to be the highlight of our trip. Little did we know these were howler monkeys, a family of about eight, and travel and eat right above our little cabina. The first to spot them was Nick, whose sole mission in Costa Rica (oh, yeah, besides to make money) was to see some monkeys. The look on his face was priceless. And the monkeys were cool, too.

Several years earlier, Abbott was prosecuting the prior patent in the EPO and submitted briefs arguing the meaning of features, where the arguments were inconsistent with the declaration submitted in the later US patent. The EPO briefs were not disclosed to the USPTO. When this fact was brought up in litigation, Abbott's patent was declared unenforceable for inequitable conduct. The Federal Circuit affirmed.

This response is not an indictment of her or any of her views in particular, but of an overall cultural attitude and, anecdotally, my experiences in having been called a slut. As have most thin, able-bodied, 20-something, highly “estrogen featured” females (and virtually no males) I know, I have been called “slut” on many occasions, most of them inappropriate (in that the term is inaccurately defined and applied) and most of them in completely non-sexual scenarios; I have been called a slut just walking to the mall in everyday attire, in a winter coat, hollered at me from teen to young men in clearly borrowed cars and I’ve paid them no mind. Banter is banter–stupid, prejudiced, whatever; as a teen I loitered, drank and smoked substances it wasn’t legal (let alone smart) for me to, I intentionally damaged public property or talked back to people I shouldn’t have, but I was also on pro-life, youth leadership, Agape, St. Vincent de Paul, and drama committees. I was raised on the Christian right theologically (though I have abandoned it) but the left of everything else politically (I am indeed the stereotypical pacifist, Atheist, Socialist, Feminist, liberal intellectual and Secular Humanist); I live in a racially and personally confused body and identity and I don’t mind being antagonistic to this day. I don’t mind and often praise this quality in others (biased or justified, arguable). But here’s where slut shaming has harmed me…

Also in BHS’s collection are the scrapbooks and autobiography of Henry A. Meyer, “who had a huge impact on Brooklyn, but nobody knows his name,” says Golia. He was a German immigrant who ran for mayor of Brooklyn in 1882, but lost. Through his Germania Real Estate Company, he developed large parts of Flatbush, including Vanderveer Park and south Midwood, turning the farms of such old Dutch families as the Lotts, Cortelyous and Van Wycks into the urban streets we know today. He was also president of the Jamaica Bay Improvement Association, and thought that Jamaica Bay was going to be the next big shipping port of the world. (That didn’t pan out, but it is home to a pretty big airport.)
It doesnt matter where I teach or how big the event is, I instantly try to find a connection to each person in the class because that is what matters. That connection is why I teach. The energy that a positive, hard working group can create is so unique and powerful. I felt it so strong today. As I was teaching this morning I really took it all in. 6 months ago I was afraid to get on a teacher's bike. I remember driving to the YMCA, telling myself that no matter what happened, I would be okay. I remember how terrified I was, I almost didn't go. I remember the first time I taught at Fly and Traci threw me up on the bike. She asked me if I was ready and I am sure I said "oh ya, totally ready." but on the inside I was dying. Scared out of my brain! The thing that I am most proud of is that I knew I wanted to do this. I knew I loved fitness and people and feeling healthy. I pushed past all of the fear and here I am today, feeling so comfortable teaching it feels like second nature.

Nonetheless, I am annoyed beyond belief and now my whole flight is ruined because I have to look at that flake of dandruff on the guy's head just inches away from me and if he reclines his seat during the flight I'm gonna lose it. Which he, of course, does, thus forcing my eyeballs to roll clear back to my cerebellum where no doubt they will someday be stuck for good.

What You Can Do
I’ve worked in several factories where I never saw the daylight – only the awful artificial strip-lighting. I often felt like a prisoner, but I made many good friends, and enjoyed the companionship of people as hard-up as myself. I hope and pray that in portraying Bradley’s difficulties, some light will be shed on the subject of ‘scabs’ and the pressure of debt. What forced them to make this difficult decision? Do they deserve the total rejection they receive even now, from the mining communities? Can they, twenty-seven years later, be understood and forgiven?
And yes, I know this post is late. The truth is that I have been kind of angry at this post because it was the reason I left my kindle on the train last week.

A week or so ago, Jake and I were enjoying a lazy Sunday afternoon, when he went upstairs to get a glass of water. And discovered that our carpet in the kitchen was soaked. (yes we have carpet in the kitchen. so dumb.) Apparently our faucet decided to start leaking, and made a huge mess. And that's where our lazy Sunday ended. We headed to the store for some tools, and Jake spent the rest of the evening trying to fix the faucet.

On 14 October 2002, Sheffield Today reported thus:
Franca made some interesting observations in the comments section. She has discovered what many have found, namely that many old tailors guard their secrets jealously... She compares the buttonhole above to the buttonholes she sees in her region (Abruzzo) but the buttonhole above has a knot, and the ones made in Abruzzo, particularly Brioni, do not have a knot- it is slightly simpler in certain respects, but require more precision. She has discovered that cloth that frays easily is not suitable, or at least will be difficult to make a stitch that is small enough even though she has overcast before stitching. I will suggest running a machine stitch 1/16" away from the cut location on each side (before cutting) which will help stabilize the area. As for the stitch itself, once I get my macro photography sorted out I will post a series of photos like the ones Matthew submitted, showing the Asola Lucida, al modo di Brioni. And yes, Franca, the only thing to do is to practice and practice some more.
From the time John J. Macreedy steps off the train in Black Rock, he feels a chill from the local residents. The town is only a speck on the map and few if any strangers ever come to the place. Macreedy himself is tight-lipped about the purpose of his trip and he finds that the hotel refuses him a room, the local garage refuses to rent him a car and the sheriff is a useless drunkard. It's apparent that the locals have something to hide but when he finally tells them that he is there to speak to a Japanese-American farmer named Kamako, he touches a nerve so sensitive that he will spend the next 24 hours fighting for his life.
The driver glares at him through his rear view mirror, hangs the phone up, and mumbles something Dr. Aregone can’t hear.

Translation and transliteration from one writing system to another involves interpretation of words, phrases and references that were common during the time of its writing and of which the translator may well be ignorant. Doing this is akin to explaining a blue sky or dazzling sunset to a blind person who has never seen these events take place. Being written originally in Hebrew or Aramaic was one prerequisite for being considered divinely inspired, according to those who cobbled the Bible together. Mistranslations can be understood, given that Hebrew was considered a divine language and was literal magic in both its written and spoken form. What is concerning, however, are preachers/ministers/rabbis/imams who are well aware there are inconsistencies in the end times beliefs they impart of their flock. The most blatant of these is a refusal to accept that any other religion has merit or credibility, regarding the end times, and only their assorted versions – which we have a had a steady diet of for hundreds of years – are truth. Let’s look at just a few other who are called “The Destroyer” by belief systems.

The Lord protected us. He had tons of struggles, including partial seizures, sleep loss, and heightened emotions, but the dire predictions didn’t come true. Ray has some residual effects, but he functions normally. In fact, his teaching is better because his new emotions improve his delivery. Ray is in the upper 3% of people who suffer from encephalitis. Now, four years later, we have so much to praise God for.

The differences of believers and non believers must be withdrawn. Christians, you must realize — we are equal.

Join your brothers and sisters and many in arms against Zionism, and let yourselves unite! the citizens of the United States cannot be defeated when united. Your founding fathers were a small group who set the course of change for the entire nation who compromised their differences. Let us draw swords together against your government and restore the real America. Let us fight. Zionists, greedy financial magnets and politicians locking control of the American politic — back off. Surrender the Constitution in its original form to the people. Or else this war will end in the shattering of one of the two warring parties. Eh pack may know this to be the people of the United States — but we know it to be all Zionists. We are not fucking playing.

Tomorrow morning, I am meeting up with Denise and we are headed to Belgium for a few days. We're spending a night each in Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, and Bruges. Should be fun. I think the hardest part will be trying to live without using my iPhone (it's 5 euros a day for 6MB if I connect to the internet with it). I'm also leaving behind my hairdryer and straightener. I'm such a girl, and it's going to be hard being without those. But it is supposed to rain the entire time, so lugging that with me would be kind of pointless anyway.
We were in Lauren's apartment flying around her room like mad women looking for shoes, jewelry, and all freaking out when she got the call they were in the garage. So I grabbed Amber to go get the boys and bring them back to the apartment. I remember seeing Anthony walking in the parking lot and just melting. He had HUGE muscles, an amazing smile, and some weird hair thing going on. So we walked them into the apartment, got our stuff and headed to putt putt. We rode in Anthony's car (his current one) and neither boys opened our car doors (BIG point deduction), Anthony raced with *B which Lauren was riding with and I remember Amber screaming something about how we were going to die and then we were there. Lauren had told us to expect to pay for ourselves so *B paid for her since they were an item, and Anthony cut in front of me to pay for me (score!), so then *G did the same for Amber.

I came up with it last year, while David Mack and I were in the midst of our third-season Star Trek Re-Watch for Tor.com. Since I was lacking for anything original to post here tonight, I decided to dig up that old blog posting and present the relevant bits here again, using the “ReWard” moniker that I’ll employ whenever I want to repost some past blog entry and make it appear like I’m still providing fresh, new content.
We also checked out the unbelievable miniatures entered in the Crystal Brush competition. Last year there was a definite top tier of miniatures but this year almost all of them were incredible. I don’t know how they picked the winners.
I feel strange with my camera, and I know I should put it away but there are not actually signs requesting no photography and nobody appears to mind a few shots.

No plot, no story. Plot thrives on conflict and with so many available distractions young readers need something to happen quickly to pull them into the story. Frederick proposes asking "what if?" at all stages of writing a story. What if Patience didn't want to go on the ocean voyage with her father? Frederick referenced the classic three act structure described in detail by Christopher Vogler in The Writer's Journey and summarized it neatly:

Pink Floyd has seen quite a resurgence in interest these past couple of years. Since the blog began, I have referenced them often. There was the amazing Dark Side of the Moon cover album headlined by the Flaming Lips (Flaming Lips’ brilliant take on Dark Side of the Moon). Then Roger Waters began his global tour where he performed the Wall in its entirety (Waters’s ‘the Wall’ live cements theme with vivid production). Now comes a comprehensive campaign reissuing and remastering the band’s entire back catalog, including some insanely thorough box set treatments for several albums.

Now onto the layout. The community is accessed through brick alleyway that connects to the main tree-lined street. On the outside we have a little guard booth which lies next to a roofed bike parking area. The keycode for the building gate is punched in to gain access to the stairs of the building. My apartment opens into the kitchen. Turning to right has the door to the small windowless living room. To the right in the living is our bathroom and straight ahead is the bedroom. The bathroom is also quite small and the shower window opens out into the hallway. Due to this feature I tend to shower first , get dressed, and then air out the room. The bedroom is decently sized and has curtains which can be closed to isolate the bed from the windowed area that juts out facing the street. We have a little metal rack to hang clothes outside the window and a little rack to grow plants.

Short films
Breakdown by country of origin? As usual, the USA was the big winner here. I think I watched far fewer foreign films this year than in years past. 71 American films, not counting hybrids like the US/India The Namesake or US/UK Children of Men. The UK was the runner-up, with 8. Ouch - that's a pretty big gap. I didn't find myself as interested in films from Asia this year as I have in years past - perhaps I'm a bit burnt out. Two Korean films, a couple of Chinese (Hong Kong actioners, really), and just one or two Japanese films. In the past, these have been pretty big numbers. It's interesting to see how much I'm trending towards America and Europe these days. Of course, since so many films are produced by multiple countries - Japan, France and the US for Marie Antoinette for example - it's getting more difficult to categorize according to national origin.
I am going to start this by saying this is a spiritual post. Not a religious or a fanatical type of post, but about faith, just the same. Most of the time I pray for healing. Sick babies, friends going in for surgery, those types of things. I pray for the healing of the heart, the mind and the body for so many, but when I pray for myself, I start to wonder if that is the right thing to do. I get lost in the thoughts about all of the mothers praying because they can't feed their children. All of the children without mothers or fathers trying to feed themselves in the street. All of the people that are being persecuted, tortured and killed just to say they believe in God. Then I feel like my prayers are insignificant. Why should my pitiful prayers be answered?

As long as we continue to recover and create more jobs, there will be an increase in consumer confidence – ultimately resulting in the housing market recovery. Entering into the election year may curtail things so rather than seeing any upward swings, I predict that we will continue along as we have. We will see the number of sales increase slightly but prices may trend down a bit in areas where there are more short sales and foreclosed properties (REOs) entering the market.

I could have just as easily subtitled this the Final Mission, because after guitarist Mick Jones was sacked the band was never the same. Plenty of ink has already been used on describing The Clash’s rock n' roll fury that burst onto the U.K. punk scene in 1976. Two guitars, bass and drums - that's the basic template that caused so much havoc, with songs that were shouted from two mouths that told of the pain and anger of living in a society that didn’t care what happened to them. Joe Strummer and Mick Jones were a classic British Rock tandem in the tradition of Lennon - McCartney, and Jagger - Richards. Joe had the swagger, Jonesy had the riffs, and with Paul Simonon on bass and eventually Topper Headon on drums their classic lineup was complete.
Every time CLG comes close to winning a tournament, the forums are flooded with either “Go Canada” or “Go America” posts. And here is where nationalism can get silly. CLG is composed of Canadians and Americans, even if HotShotGG tries to present himself as American (he does). These posts inevitably deteriorate into nationalist posts, with Canadians calling Americans fat, stupid, or hostile, and Americans calling Canadians weak, “eh” sayers, or referencing Canada as a state or America’s hat. It’s like clockwork. Mention a country’s name, you’ll get its defenders, critics, and those who don’t care.

The need for patterns results from using computer languages or techniques with insufficient abstraction ability. Under ideal factoring, a concept should not be copied, but merely referenced.

Lightly grease a 13x9" baking pan. Melt chocolate and butter in a large bowl in a double boiler (or microwave chocolate and butter on medium for 2 minutes). Stir in sugar until well blended. Mix in the eggs and vanilla. Stir in the flour and nuts and spread in the pan. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 25-35 minutes (mine only takes 25 but it depends on your oven). Check them after 25 mins with a knife, if it comes out clean they are ready! Make sure you don't over bake them. For the icing, melt the chocolate and butter together (microwave or double boiler). Then blend in the water until smooth. Spread over cooled brownies and ENJOY! :)

But this is not an ancient ritual – though the myth of the Olympic torch is deep-rooted. Janie Hampton, in her book on the 1948 London Olympics, for example, assures us that ‘in the ancient Olympics, there had been torch relays spreading out from Olympia to tell the people that the Games were starting’. No there weren’t. The Austerity Olympics (2008) is a splendid book, but it is wrong about this.

Everyone just wants Alice to get the Vorpal Sword so she can kill the Jabberwocky because they all suck too much to do it themselves. There’s something here about how societies can be trapped by prophecies but that’s a comment about fantasy worlds more than real worlds and really, the film doesn’t do anything with it. We’re just supposed to accept it. Well, screw that, I’ve got a new story idea; thanks, Tim Burton, for not thinking too hard about the story. There’s also something here about how societies can have their spark beaten out of them by dictators, and that they can end up simply wishing for rescue instead of doing anything about it themselves, but the film doesn’t do anything with that, either.
But while enterprise software is in dire need of a revolution, it represents just a fraction of what will be disrupted by radical simplification. Instagram’s billion-dollar acquisition and rise to 40 million users can mostly be attributed to the creation of the cleanest, most elegant, and simplest way to share photos on mobile devices. It could do this by focusing solely on nailing a brilliant experience on a single platform, while leveraging the scale and distribution offered by iPhones. SolveBio, a startup aimed at bio-scientists, is building a trivially simple solution that advances DNA and medical research, enabled by the infinite computing resources of Amazon. Spotify, arguably the fastest-growing music service today, reduced the friction of getting to unlimited music from any device down to nothing. By stepping back and questioning every assumption in music licensing and software, Spotify has built an unparalleled product and experience.

An early goal would have changed the complexion of the match entirely. But it never came and the remainder of the half disappeared into a glistening haze as neither side was able to forge the opening which would make the crucial difference.

In his remarks, Aurel and AWWA endorsed a new approach to funding the overhaul of our water infrastructure– the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA). The act is modeled after the highly successful Transportation Infrastructure and Innovation Act (TIFIA). WIFIA would lower the cost of infrastructure investment and alter the financing process so that communities would be able to afford the necessary replacements in their water systems. WIFIA would “assist communities in meeting the nation’s water infrastructure needs in a manner that would have minimal cost to the federal government while complementing existing financial mechanisms, maintaining the current federal role, leveraging private capital, and creating vital manufacturing and construction jobs.” The entire program would provide a feasible solution for communities to address the water infrastructure problem, while also providing a cleaner environment and greater quality of life for residents.

Many believe African Mango may slow digestion, alleviate constipation and decrease the assimilation of fat and carbohydrates that the body intakes. It can soak up a great deal of water, many people are using it because they feel it supports a feeling of being full.
There are many reasons we have chosen to become foster parents, and we love talking about them! A lot of our curious friends and family have posed the question, “Why foster care? Don’t you want your own kids?”.

So. Jeff has a talk with the monkey and tries to explain to him that he needed to have courage to eat the zucchini. He needed to look at it like Super Man would look at kryptonite and ATTACK the zucchini! The boy took a couple of quick breaths and ran back into the kitchen, determined to beat the dreaded green yuck. A few minutes later he came out, triumphant! Good job, monkey! You did it!

Second bad point of luck. The rain. Two different times this week I went out to the grocery store in good weather and while I was inside, the rains started. (If you remember, our van is somewhere inbetween here and Portugal right now.) The first time, it wasn't raining that hard. Hatice was home with the kids. I just had my wagon to pull. So I started pulling it. It started raining harder and harder.

When you buy a mens watch, you want to get the watch that you you want, and not just what is available at the local mall. Shop online to buy a mens watch and you will find exactly what you are looking for. There is only one place to look if you want to browse 100′s and 1000′s of fine quality mens watches.

Your office neighbors may have a negative reaction or be confused and may not have the resources to receive education or have someone to set expectations regarding this change. They may reach out to you or you may want to reach out to them in order to provide assistance. What you want to avoid is leaving your office neighbors without resources to allow them to be educated or be aware of the expectations. This can result in a negative response and even turn into harassment for your employee.

What the transfiguration says to you and to me is this. “You are significant. You are loved”. Why? Because the One who came to die for us on the cross is none other than the Son of God Himself. How can we ever say that God doesn’t love us! What more does He have to do, to show us how much He loves us? The coming of Jesus Christ into this world, and His dying on the cross for sinners like you and me, shows two things.

"Gelhausen was the local bootlegger who also had a saloon down on Clara Avenue. There was a wire leading from their house out to the garage. In the center of the yard there was a light bulb hanging from the wire. Sometimes at night, we would see the light flashing on and off -- like Morse Code. Sometimes this was followed by a car in the alley, pulling up to the garage. We never went to investigate.

I’ll admit that I did get a bit lost in the modern critical approaches chapter. It was interesting that as time as passed, critics have come to rate Emily above Charlotte in their reviews. Charlotte is much beloved by feminist critics, and there has been an increase in interest in Anne. Contemporary critics hardly reviewed Anne’s novels, which is a shame as I would rate Anne’s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall right up there with Charlotte’s Jane Eyre and Emily’s Wuthering Heights. It’s also interesting that contemporary critics of Charlotte Bronte said this of Jane Eyre, “ the plot is most extravagantly improbable.” I disagree. While there are some fantastical elements of the plot, so much of it is based on Charlotte’s real world experiences growing up that it has a deep sense of truth to it.
Jezebel was a wicked woman. Ahab gave into her and allowed her to usurp his role as the authority of his house. This is not an uncommon thing. Unfortunately, even among Christians, men have neglected their role to be the leaders of their homes, while the women long to have such leadership. It is all a apart of the fall. Only the Lord can put things in their proper order.

Eventually the missing actor arrived in a flurry of panic and snow, only to discover once half undressed, that he had no costume. So then commenced the most bizarre moment I've had for a many a year, as two grown men stripped to their pants in the dark of backstage and swapped clothes in a frantic high-speed manner. The actor resumed his rightful place on stage to applause from the audience, and the director was packed off for a stiff sherry in the bar. All's well that ends well, to coin another phrase.

So today's payday. For me that means that I spend about 15 minutes online, paying bills and whatnot. As part of that process, I logged on to my credit card's website to see what my balance was so that I could schedule a payment. When I did so, I noticed a charge that I did not make or authorize. I also noticed that, right next to the charges listed, there was an option that said, "Have questions about a charge you see here? Click here to chat with a credit card representative." So I did. After some back and forth (wherein the "representative" named "Austin" basically just pointed me to another part of the website where you go to disupute charges), we were wrapped up our chat. Here's what went down:
Last night, walking her alone in the hazy, humid darkness, I heard the sound of a fierce dog barking. I know by now all the homes in the neighborhood where dogs live. Behind their fences, they can bark without concerning me. And my feisty little friend can bark back without bringing a death sentence upon herself.
Puritans claimed wedding rings were a pagan ritual and outlawed them. They were enraged when the Catholic church claimed that Mary and Joseph wore wedding rings made from Onyx or Amethyst, which would have taken the history of wedding bands back pretty far.
I was nearly dying at this point, I'm just NOT a wave-maker in life but I wouldn't be able to get OVER it if I didn't do something. I walked the supervisor through the conversation (and felt SO STUPID when I cried after telling him the final comment and how I thought that it was cruel) and told him that I respect their jobs and know that sometimes people have bad days and make mistakes but that this man had crossed the line too many times.
I’m referring to the secret code of one-up-manship that brides subscribe to. I have had friends get married and let me tell you they’re not subtle in their quest to make sure their wedding outdoes so-and-so’s wedding. The Bride’s sole aim is to make her day perfect and God help her if it’s not. This means that the flowers that no one remembers, the place cards that end up trampled on the floor, the cake that most people are too pissed to eat, and I’m afraid to say the wedding dress that not even the groom can describe are all just a labour of futility. If you ask me to describe all the wedding dresses of all the brides at all the weddings I’ve been to I could probably give you colour and guess as to whether it had straps or not; if in doubt guess “white boobtube”. Sadly the “perfect dress” is perfectly forgettable. The only thing that matters on the day is that the bridesmaids don’t upstage the bride.

As I approached the human blockade I took a deep breath and said into my phone, “Well, this DOES count as being on time… I’m, like, a few yards away from you. Will you stop saying I’m late? Uh-huhhhh…”, and as I broke through the human chain – at this most crucial and precarious fraction of a moment — deftly taking a casual diagonal side-step around the legs most directly in my way, and thus slipping nonchalantly between the middle guy and the next guy in line, I threw them a smile. I smiled right at them and added a conspiratorial eye roll regarding the shit I was clearly taking on the phone for being late. And suddenly I was past them, almost free.
This is what turned up. Twelve kilos of potatoes! Apparently I ordered four bags. So it looks like we'll be eating potato soup, frittatas, roast potatoes, boiled potatoes and mashed potatoes all week. I'm even considering setting up a market stall out the front of our house.

Reports of the age of the Crown Prince range from 81 to 86 years old, a common dispute for many older Saudis. My own husband actually has three different official birthdays. Saudi Arabia uses the lunar Hijri calendar, which is 11-12 days shorter than the Gregorian calendar used in the west. This can create disputes about someone's birthdate when trying to convert the Arabic dates into the western calendar. The Islamic calendar is purely based on the moon and does not take into account the seasons. The cycle of the seasons repeats itself in the Hijri calendar only once every 33 Islamic years.

It looked pretty fun. I had her test it out for me. She said it was scary but worth it. So I may get up enough nerve to try it out. Chris has been busy working but also spending good quality time with the family.
Central and Eastern Europe/Eurasia: In the CEE/Eurasia region, 7 countries (24 percent) remained classified as Free, 13 (45 percent) were rated Partly Free, and 9 (31 percent) were rated Not Free. However, a majority of the people in this region (56 percent) lived in Not Free media environments, while 29 percent lived in Partly Free countries and only 15 percent had access to Free media—the smallest share since 2003. In 2011, the regional average score underwent a significant decline, with negative movement in all three thematic (legal, political, and economic) categories. While the average for the Eurasia subregion was almost completely static, deterioration in the typically better-performing subregion of Central and Eastern Europe was marked, driven by significant numerical declines in Hungary and Macedonia in particular.

Kaitlyn (7) has been taking gymnastics this year and can finally do a cartwheel! She is also in piano (despite her not really wanting to) and she is able to sit down and read simple music pieces. She just had her first piano recital and played "Up On the Housetop." She also enjoyed soccer last spring and her second year of swim team last summer. She was able to swim on the freestyle relay in the Championship meet this year where they earned 3rd place, taking home the bronze medal. Her time improved drastically as she finally learned how to do a "side" breath. She's lost a lot of teeth and can finally ride a bike without training wheels! Lastly, she is a brownie scout this year. Kaitlyn's favorite activity continues to be drawing. One day I am going to put a book together of all her drawings that I've been collecting over the years. She is still very silly and she's very giving and considerate of others, much more so than the average child her age.

With bated breath I ask Katie what she thins of Liz Shaw. I explain that she probably grew out Zoe as a smart companion, and that as a Scientist from Cambridge she was really ahead of her time for a woman on TV in the early 70's, Katie agrees but still thinks that Liz is portrayed in a boring way. She says that she doesn't at all believe Liz's turnaround from sceptic to believing in the Doctor, with which I agree. All in all she's a beige character and undeveloped. I disagree to some extent but have to admit to be perfectly honest I was never that fond of her either. We do however both agree that we love the Brig, Katie says, "he's just so British."
Whatever else we might say about this story we can say this: The man in the story, the paralyzed man, the man who never says a word, the man lowered through a hole in the roof, had all sorts of obstacles in his path to grace. Here’s what Luke tells us: “One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem, were sitting there.” Now, was this a literal statement? If every village in Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem had its own representation of Pharisees and teachers of the law—and there were representations from all of them that day—and they were all sitting there while Jesus taught—well, this was the first obstacle to this man experiencing God’s grace.

We departed about 2:30 in the afternoon and drove directly back into the Republic of Ireland. At about 4:30 we stopped in Donegal and had supper at the Abbey Hotel. Sherri and I had salmon which was excellent. The sides left a little to be desired but the fish itself was out of this world. You certainly can’t go wrong ordering salmon in Ireland. As we were getting ready to leave there was a huge commotion outside the hotel. There was a reception of some type at the hotel and everyone in town was out at “the Diamond” in the center of town.
Think carefully about what equipment you really need. The place is packed with tourists and in the palace the security guards ask you to carry your bag in front of you.

By the beginning of the 19th century many of the settlers had begun to move eastward. Early marriage was the norm, and this, in turn, had brought about a significant rise in the size of the population, triggering concern among the elders that, if they did not prepare for the future, there would be no land for their children to inherit. … A pressing problem at a time when land prices had risen.

First, let’s be clear, BO was never a “Constitutional law scholar” nor was he ever a “Constitutional law professor.” He was a (part-time) lecturer at the University of Chicago who never published so much as one piece of scholarship in any field, let alone in Constitutional law, and who, for whatever reason, voluntarily gave up his license to practice law in the state of Illinois. He never presented at or sat on/organized any panel at any academic or professional conference (and probably never even attended one). His academic credentials are pretty much nil.
I have been dreaming up a cute little toddler room setup and the process has completely consumed me at times. I find myself spending hours online shopping and comparing - beds, dressers, toy boxes, book shelves...oh my...I cannot wait!! IKEA has a pretty good contender for a toddler bed - the length (yes--of the whole bed) is adjustable and it comes with a cute matching toy chest! I also found some cute chairs. Oh yeah--Gabe is totally obsessed with little chairs. If he finds one anywhere--or anything that somewhat resembles a chair--he will sit on it. Who am I kidding? He'll sit on anything. The other day I caught him sitting on a shoe. Seriously, though, the kid is like Goldilocks - a connoisseur of chairs. Only he's obviously not as picky if he'll sit on a shoe. He found a cool little chair that he liked at IKEA though!!

That’s it. Nothing about whether you can write words or not. Or point arrows at the relevant part of your pic. Or angrily draw Dropkick Murphys logos when you’re tasked to draw “Bieber.” The game trusts players to figure out for themselves what works or doesn’t. I started a random game with a stranger and for their first drawing, they just wrote out the word I was supposed to guess. I forfeited the few coins I would have won, passed on the round and abandoned that player. (I do, however, write out words sometimes — if I got “lilwayne” you can be sure I’d write out “YEAAAyuhhh.”) Gamers naturally know what they want out of the experience and will seek out platforms and players that support that.

Perhaps one way of saying it is that other popular American sports tend to make us older while soccer, at its best, makes us younger. Part of this is simple logistics: Most American sports demand a lot of (expensive) equipment and/or feature a complex rulebook. Golf, gymnastics, hockey, or baseball… you better have rich parents to bankroll your fun. Even in more egalitarian sports like basketball or football, you still need a very specific kind of ball, lots of equipment and, in the case of basketball, a very specific kind of hoop. You can’t just conjure a basketball hoop or football from things lying around the house. Believe me, as a child, I tried. But a bucket hanging on a hook on your bedroom door just doesn’t work. So you either need to have a lot of money or you need access to a rec center where the needed equipment is provided. Yet rec centers aren’t exactly cultivators of imagination either. There you’ll find plenty of rules and limitations which, again, have nothing to do with the kind of healthy limitations naturally imposed upon us by our own bodies. I remember once playing basketball at the YMCA and being told that my team had to pass the ball five times before we took a shot – try running a fast break with those rules. For someone whose favorite player growing up was Jason Kidd, such an environment was stifling and robbed the game of its fun. All of this is to say that the institutionalized structure of most American sports places clamps upon the imagination that have nothing to do with the necessary limitations of the human body or spirit of play, both of which are healthy limitations that we ought to embrace.

Good Morning Everyone! I hope everyone is having a great day so far.
Surprisingly, Hearts have the second best defence in the league, conceding the same amount of goals as Celtic. I say surprising because it really is made up of a bunch of misfits and average players from around the country. It’s a Mighty Ducks of a back four. Danny Grainger and Jamie Hamill have been regular picks at full back and Sergio hasn’t really had much room for manoeuvre. Like kids in an orphanage, he’s playing with someone else’s toys. Both were signed by Jefferies and I don’t imagine St.Johnstone’s and Kilmarnock’s pretty average full-backs were in Sergio’s dossier on his arrival from Portugal. Yet somehow, they have been part of a pretty successful defence.

Bi-Visibility is important. If we peel back the layers of homophobia we may not be surprised to learn that central to homophobia is fear. This fear is not necessarily fear of difference but similarity. When it comes to attacking homophobia, discrimination and stereotypes — bisexuality is at the forefront not the background. I argue bisexual visibility is important to combating homophobia because it challenges the binary thinking that allows one to produce an “other” in which to discriminate against. Whether you are gay, straight, asexual, bisexual, or pansexual the existence of bisexuality is proof of the validity of varying identities. Sexuality is fluid in varying degrees for different people. If we are honest with ourselves, many “straight” homophobic people fear the thought that they themselves may be gay or have gay tendencies. To counteract this fear they create an other or a not to maintain an existential understanding of themselves.
That’s how I’d describe the scene at the DMV this afternoon. Tomorrow every DMV office in the state of Kansas will be closed through Friday.

I enjoyed Polaris, but find that the books get better with time.* Seeker, with its discussion of the role of history in contemporary life, captivated me. McDevitt seasons the plot with questions on government and politics. The place of religion in a cosmos where man has spread out among the stars is a major theme in all of the books, particular in Firebird, but I think my favorite so far has been the Devil’s Eye. It has everything I love in Science Fiction: the big idea, a terrible secret buried by authority, remote stellar outposts, and even an appearance by McDevitt’s one alien species, the telepathic mutes. The Devil’s Eye delves into the tensions we all face with our governments and our place in things. All of the books use quotes to start new chapters, usually these are from future books McDevitt has created. The Devil’s Eye draws heavily on a series of horror novels, and McDevitt uses them to inject some commentary on the art of writing into things.

But I think that worked out well, its still a first draft, and I already know what I want to change and where the changes need to be made, which isn’t something I usually do with typed works.

According to Scientific America, (source: Girl Brain, Boy Brain? By Lise Eliot. September 8, 2009), which states that ‘Sex differences in empathy emerge in infancy and persist throughout development, though the gap between adult women and men is larger than between girls and boys. ‘ Gender socialisation is the more focused form of socialisation; it is how children of different sexes are socialised into their gender roles (source: Socialization and Gender Roles within the Family: A study on adolescents and their parents in Great Britain.

And so the story continues from there… It was terribly shocking, sad, and strange to see something so similar take place on June 1, 2011 in western Massachusetts. Many people were emailing, facebooking, and texting me yesterday and today about the occurrence, saying “is this Montgomery Lake High?” My prayers go out to all the tornado victims from yesterday. If it can be at all a glimmer of hope, I state that in When Darkness Tries to Hide tragedy strikes BUT an immeasurable amount of good comes from the situation. I pray that will be the outcome of yesterday’s devastating storm… and always remember the meaning of Romans 8:28.
The latest genre of gurus is the ‘humble’ guru. The fad among them now, is competing to become the ‘humbler guru.’ But guruship cannot be given up by them at any cost. They somehow want disciples. They don’t mind any guru reform as long as there are disciples. It is not just a guru disease but a ‘disciple disease’ – a disease, ranging from gross to subtle manifestation of usurping Your position and Your disciples in ISKCON.

'Experts recommend three alcohol-free days a week' the paper pronounces. Who are these 'experts'? The Indy doesn't tell us. Plus hang on a minute. It was only recently that they recommended two days a week off booze. At this rate we'll all be told to become teetotal by Easter.

Two gentlemen from Australia, Ron Tesoriero and investigative reporter Mike Willesee, spoke about their investigation and documentation of several miraculous events such as a weeping statue, a communion host changing to flesh, and a woman in Bolivia with the stigmata. The interesting angle is that they use science to prove the validity of these miracles.
The last eight months here in Germany have been an adventure. At times difficult; however, like all good adventures, rewarding. Neither me nor my husband were expecting some of the difficulties we encountered but the experience so far has undoubtedly made us stronger and more patient.

So I noticed that throughout my life all I did was gathering knowledge and very rarely applying it in my reality. Most of the time throughout my world I kept things for myself just being an observer of reality rather than active participant. I would only share myself with few closest friends and otherwise just be the normal silent me. What that did was that I have internalized the conversation in my head thus developing quite complicated mind network where I can and do get lost sometimes.

“The White Dragon” begins with Ruth’s first flight, proving that – although small – he is plenty strong enough to carry his rider. Freed from the hold by his dragon’s ability to fly between, Jaxom sets out to prove Ruth is a real dragon by secretly teaching him to chew firestone so he can flame Thread. To make time between his many duties as Lord Holder’s son, he and Ruth fly between to the distant past – one of his white dragon’s many talents (another being the ability to communicate with the little fire lizards the people of Pern keep as messengers and pets).

Her new album, “Let It Break”, has some cracking songs about the heart on it, like “Ruin” or, my favourite, the anthemic “Shock to My System“, which is just downright catchy while being effortlessly touching. A tale of a life “half alive” because of pain and disappointment and sheer bloody habit being set on fire by the arrival of a love who then simply fucks off, I find myself really touched and wondering about my own life, my own often chequered history. The best songs do that to you, I suppose.

Ale yeast is best used at temperatures from 55°F to 75°F. Fermentation by ale yeasts produces a beer that has a distinctive ale flavor. Ale yeasts are top fermenting, in that they settle out on top of the wort after fermenting. Steam beer uses bottom fermenting lager yeasts at ale temperatures, which results in a very distinct flavor profile that includes both ale & lager characteristics.
I've always had a fondness for Krispy Kreme - My Dad and I used to visit one of the original ones in Charleston when I was little and we'd always get the same thing. I loved the swivel stools and the chrome and the 'regulars' who would sit and do their crossword puzzles. I think it would be a fun, quirky locale loaded with nostalgia but I just don't know if it would be appropriate.
The W band of the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum ranges from 75 to 110 GHz. It sits above the U.S. IEEE designated V band (50–75 GHz) in frequency, yet overlaps the NATO designated M band (60–100 GHz). The W band is used for satellite communications, millimeter wave radar research, military radar targeting and tracking applications, and some non-military applications.

Its weird, in a month's time I have felt a slight shift in myself. I am actually planning events, instead of being the passive person. I've already planned a hangout with my near-by college friends, and some old high school friends. I feel so proud of myself :) Especially since losing touch with people is a bad habit of mine. I want to kick myself when I think about it. I had 2 really good friends in high school, we were inseparable (I even lived with one of them). But somehow, during college I drifted away from them.
I break the law on occasion. I like Pikesville Rye whiskey, and in the summer, I drink it with lots of ice, ginger ale, and a big squeeze of lemon. It's refreshing and tasty. But...Pennsylvania doesn't sell it, doesn't even offer it on special order. So I hang my head, and duck across the border to Maryland and head into almost any liquor store and pick some up. It's common. I've bought it in drug stores (oh, God, the freedom...). And you know, look: if PA wants the tax, give me a way to pay it, and I will. The stuff is so darned cheap, I wouldn't mind, not really.
I was so inspired by the creativity and care you all put into the recipes you submitted to the Holiday Reader Recipe Challenge, that I decided to put together a fine selection for everyone to enjoy. It's your gift to me, back to you.
First things first: lunch. Then a bit of a wander. We found a nice playground up in the old part of town and I skulked off to take some pictures.
Though, I draw from my imagination in most cases, there is a great deal of drawing that came before. To learn to paint/draw a thing, I immerse myself first in a complete sensual understanding of that thing. To know that there are always an uneven number of flower petals and the parts of a flower is super important to draw ... ahem ... realistic, imaginary flowers (or anything for that matter)

Yesterday morning I attempted a sock bun. I've seen so many people on the internet and in real life who have had great results; they end up with a cute bun that is wound tightly and in perfect position. Some how my bun did not go so well. I was fine with the bun I achieved because I like big hair, but it was definitely more like a big mass of hair piled on the top of my head. I'll have to keep trying for that ballet perfect coif.

I think, in the end, maybe he really is cheap, but he has taught me to be frugal, and since I am the one who does 99% of the shopping for the family, maybe, just maybe, his cheapness is a good thing! We've never been able to do the classic budget cuts since those things usually weren't options to begin with- Prince Charming makes most of the repairs on our home (he's very handy), I don't get my hair colored (no grays yet!), we don't spend a lot on clothes- buying on sale and off season), we eat at home 6 nights a week, etc.
Within a matter of days, I received a phone call from the Vice President himself. He said he was so intrigued and impressed with my tenacity and creativity that he just had to call. As it turned out, he was sharing a secretary with another executive but didn’t have the time to look for someone of his own. After having a short phone conversation, I went in for a personal interview the next day and was hired immediately.
In a bowl combine the ricotta and mozzarella cheese, basil, a little salt and pepper to season. Gently open a few petals of the flower and with a teaspoon, stuff it with the ricotta mixture, enough to fill the cup and still fold the petals around; twist the top of the petals together to seal.
However, nothing like that happens today, under the willfully averted gaze of "state controlled media." Operation Fast and Furious, a scandal that is demonstrably orders of magnitude worse than Watergate, gets a complete pass. The MSM is too busy covering the latest celebrity escapades to be bothered with mere mass-murder, carried out as an intended part of a federal "law enforcement operation" (sic) at the Obama administration's direction.

You’ve done this too, probably. You might read a review of some new software that will help you create, or a new fashion style or some cool shoes or beautiful furniture or the newest iPad, or the latest iPhone app. Or maybe you’re a minimalist and read someone’s barefoot running article, or how they’re living out of a backpack, and want to try that.
The movement of the EDL into politics and away from protest, is either an act of utter stupidity or evidence of the infiltration of the EDL by undercover police who are working to get the organisation banned / proscribed.

On the list of things to do this week: (1) Preparing for a Giveaway here at Wiccan Writes. Stay tuned! (2) Also, the ever-ongoing spring cleaning (do I do windows? we will see.). (3) Taking a ride out to Fey Dragon, my favorite metaphysical shop in Oswego NY. My friend Mary has laid in a bunch of new items, and is hosting Raven Grimassi and his wife this month for a couple of seminars. Raven Grimassi is a notable Wiccan author and I am excited at the prospect of meeting him. Fey Dragon is where we go for our monthly Drum Circle.
I found these shoes in my closet, my first thought, oh how adorable, and then I got another flash, the message was clear: ~Dear Mommy, I am watching everything you do, so don't screw up.~
I think WvW will be a more satisfactory experience of inter-player combat for me as the systems have been set up to allow, at one end, large groups of people (such as organised guilds) to co-ordinate huge raids on enemy keeps all the way to the other end where small teams of casual players can take out or defend supply lines. As I see myself firmly at the casual end of that spectrum, I am *really* excited by this as it means I can take part in the war rather than finding myself ignored by the cool kids and left on the bench like the wheezy kid in a school PE lesson.
Not only did these books not make me sob at the two hundred and seventeenth reading, they were also influential in inspiring me to write my own picture books. Although I adored quirky picture books (and still do), I also hankered for more traditional stories that affirmed my love for our very young children. I wanted to reassure them that the world could be a good place. In the nineties, Martin Waddell’s books fulfilled this emotional need and became a potent catalyst for my future writing. I too wanted to write picture books that would speak to others.
NB:- I just checked my result, twas fair, I saw some woeful results on the board and that prompted me to write this. I hope i was able to convey the message. Do comment if you read this. Thanks…
Today, as we rapidly move from paper to digital books, authors not only write the books, but they also design the cover, and act as publisher and marketer.

Not all rivers flow the same. Paddling enraged gorges that thrash with gallons of pressurized water requires different equipment than a placid stream gurgling over smooth stones.

Bottom line: I honestly don’t expect Lance to now come roaring back and to pound Andy Schleck, Cadel Evans, and Alberto Contador into submission. Velonews now reports that Lance intends to stay on and ride for his team instead of trying for a podium position. I think it’s a wise decision.
This is a low-budget movie, as most zombie movies tend to be, however it is well thought out and in keeping with recent French horror releases, it is very violent. Fans of gory, bloody, brutal action will love it and probably forgive the lack of exposition and inconsistencies within the script. It looks good for what it is, probably due to budget restrictions the idea to use a run-down apartment block actually makes sense and the grimy setting really works in the movies favour. The special effects are a fairly good blend of make-up, blood and CGI which is used sparingly to enhance the blood/gore effects in certain scenes.

*tip* if you use the blender make sure your peaches are not overly ripe. I prefer a chunkier consistency and may just chop everything next time rather than blending.

Belgium is one of those European countries best known for beer. The brews that come from the country are known for its superior overall quality and exquisite, world-class taste. Meanwhile, the United States is known to be a beer loving country that makes many unique brews. So what happens when an American brewer goes to Belgium to create Belgian-style beer? You get something like Stillwater A Saison Darkly.

Ask and you shall receive: Leander has admitted in the press that before the start of the season he clearly communicated to Radek about his career aspirations. He was forthcoming on his inability to win the Australian Open and the Masters title—the two rare ones that eluded him the most. And Radek made it happen for him by helping him win Australian Open at the very first instance. Now, coming back to our lives, do we always let our leaders know about our career aspirations? Ignorance is not always bliss.

However, the pro-tobacco lobby's claims that the smoking ban has led to pub closures are unfounded. In 2007, the year England went smokefree, the number of licensed premises for "on sales" of alcohol actually increased by 5% and there has been a net increase in the number of people reporting going to pubs since the smokefree law came into effect.
