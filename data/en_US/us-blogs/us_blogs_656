The reason these issues are so important is, to quote Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, the next election will be “the mother of all elections”.
Socialism has had more success in Canada than in the US. As Seymour Lipset explained, early America was “Whig and classically liberal” founded on “doctrines that emphasize distrust of the state, egalitarianism and populism . . .” In contrast, our chilly Dominion was “Tory and conservative in the British . . . sense – accepting of the need for a strong state, for respect for authority, for deference – and endorsed by hierarchically organised religions that supported and were supported by the state.”

Back upstairs, emails are read, saved to draft, responded to, received. Job boards are scanned, applied to, Skyped and accepted. Online research is done, albeit liberally peppered with side clicks to cute animals, videos of people falling over and shameful Hollywood gossip. The printer jerks into action, whining and blinking; loose leaves floating haphazardly to the floor if my attention is on numbskulls in front of paparazzi instead of the numerical order of pages.

The rise, fame and fall of George Best. BEST is a wicked animated re-telling of the troubled life of footballs first superstar George Best (who we all know is Manchester United’s former superstar). George Best. Journeying through his childhood in Belfast before swinging into the glorious sixties; his silky skills on the Manchester United pitch soon catch the ever growing gaze of the British press. George, quite literally has the world at his feet, but with the paparazzi’s glaring lense firmly focused on his every move, things soon begin to spiral out of control…
My healing journey would look totally different had I received one word of apology from her. Had she expressed remorse or regret, had she expressed that she felt she’d made a mistake, or felt badly – I would be in a much better place than I am. Instead she mocked me, called me names, ridiculed me physically, and then expressed excitement and joy in the fact that my hard work and strife would be going to pay HER child support. She expressed joy at the idea of me slaving away to pay her monthly while she sits back and collects. She actually said the words, followed by a “Yay me!”. She then dragged us through the legal system with the help of a free lawyer, cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars, and continues now to squabble over $20 prescriptions for her child, for which we pay $19, and she pays $1 because her income is so disparate to ours.
Today, after two months of playing musical phones, I went online again and found a phone number for billing support and dialed in via Skype. The computer asked for my phone number, which I keyed in. Then it looked up my record and after a few more touch tone answers, connected me to a very helpful woman. She asked for my email address and said she’d email me a copy of my overdue bill. Only she misheard the email address and sent it into the ether. But, she’d told me the amount of the last bill. A key piece of information recognized by their computer system! With this data I was able to finally register online and access my account.

This was a film that had it all as far as a fanboy as myself is concerned. The drama, pathos, comedy and action elements of the comic and cartoon world put in a film experience. I’m really glad that the film impressed me as it did, as I have quite low standards for films after many disappointments, many of the films leading up to the Avengers, for instance were hit and miss. There is a sense in which this film seems to capture a mindset of the status quo. The plotline of the tesseract as a form of ‘clean’ energy is an interesting one of contemporary relevance. The clandestine behaviour of S.H.I.E.L.D. and their borderline unethical plans reflect a distrust of institutional authority. The coda of the film where various talking heads talk about the Avengers and the range of opinions about them reflect a media age where criticism and a variety of views and fears are addressed, some of these threads of discussion in the coda are addressed in the comic and animated incarnations of the Avengers and wider Marvel comics (such as the Civil War story arc).
When he stands up to address the chairmen and call the old guard to the carpet by pointing out that ‘dues paying’ republicans who weren’t even present at the meeting were picked as delegates whilst his entire precinct was left a void of representation by having no one from among their ranks numbered, this man’s thunderous pissed offedness still seems to be under restraint by he who harnesses its magnitude. His face told that he was holding much more in and what we were being served up was merely the tip of a much colder, much bigger, much harder iceberg just beneath the squall. This is a man you don’t want to step in the ring with because though he’s short and white you can tell by the beaming rays of unction coming from this dude’s eyes that by the end of the tussle its him that’s getting the slo motion exit and you that gets the cheesy ‘Punisher’ movie.

And I think I mostly agree with that, although I'd add the caveat of "as long as it doesn't hurt someone else." But I think that's the message we're getting from...somewhere. Maybe the media. Maybe society. Maybe, we're all just pre-wired to be self-serving jerks. And then we like to whine about other people who are bigger jerks.

We watched a BMX demonstration show that was awesome! Riders on bicycles and skateboards, and even a guy on roller blades, flipping and jumping over each others -- and an audience volunteer.
Tonight it gave me pause to sit and think about all of this and reflect back on it. Particularly because I feel like (as previously stated in posts long ago) I am very close to finishing up something I have worked on for a while that will yield great financial result.
All week I have been down with a nondescript "bug". Low grade fever, achy all over, and extremely tired. I could not drag myself to the Scrap Cave not even a single day.

If you have never actually MET Matthew but have followed his life since he was born, know that we WISH that you could meet him so he he could know that you have been a part of his life because you have been out there THINKING and PRAYING for him. He would grace you with his love, his hugs and his SMILES…and if you have a phone, and you let him play with it, well, you would have made a FRIEND FOR EVER!!! This little guy LOVES phones and we actually have to talk code if we talk about our phone or where it is and GOD FORBID it rings and it is hidden some where and he hears it…it’s OVER!!! The phone is HIS!! He is such a great little guy. Always happy and always HAPPIEST wherever DADA is at…his favorite word in the world is DADA…I really need to video tape him when dad comes home…the JOY he shows makes you want to cry! Although thinking back if you put on his favorite movie he kinda does the same think…..JUST KIDDING! His love for dada is just AMAZING…

Ordinary conservatives have largely abandoned George Bush's governmental adventurism and regret his ambitious projects, and have completely thrown over "big government conservatism" as an oxymoron. Many of us have learned our lessons about war, and don't want to start any more. We are also waking up on civil liberties, which used to be the exclusive domain of liberals and libertarians.

I've liked all the tours I've been a part of. We did a tour with Mother of Mercy, and Foundation a while back that was awesome. It was the first full U.S. tour that we did, and Sound & Fury was great that year. We went to Japan with H2O a little bit ago that was sick. Those dudes were really cool people to hang with, and seeing friends from across the world was cool too.

You see, in all honesty, I still want to eat meat. I enjoy it (don't judge!) But now I want to eat meat in a way that causes the least amount of suffering to the animals that end up on my plate. So a quick, individualized kill at the market seems to me, at this stage, to be a better death than one at the processing plant. And I should be woman enough to look my future chicken soup in the eye before I eat it right? We shall see how I really feel about this when I scrape together the courage to actually do this in a few days.

Colin had been to Inverguserain before, and Iain had shown him the patches of garnet sand that occur naturally on the beach. I’d never even heard of garnet sand before, and as you can imagine, I was keen to see it!

My life is like a laundry basket. Wow, that does not sound too terribly profound or exciting! I came to that conclusion this morning as I carried a meager load to the laundry room before work. I looked at my basket and it was nearly empty. For whatever reason, my laundry basket has been a thermometer of my stress level as a Mom. I can remember thinking, if I can just get this laundry under control I will be able to breathe! It seemed that every time I could almost see the bottom of the basket, or some days the laundry room floor, another load of clothes would just show up! When all 4 kids were small, the basket was always full of little socks, onesies, outfits with spit up, and wet little underwear of the child that was currently being potty trained. Soon, that laundry room was full of white shirts, plaid skirts, and navy pants as the 4 kids were in grade school uniforms. The high school days brought more laundry…and very smelly laundry. I had sweaty socks, running shorts and shirts and the dreaded football practice pants and jersey that literally “walked” into the laundry room on Friday afternoons after a week of sitting in a football locker. I would wash and fold and then see those same sweaty smelly socks (inside out, my pet peeve) return the next day it seemed.

But then, something that even I have to admit is even cuter came along. We are driving down the road with a very knowledgeable guide who suddenly decides that we really should stop on the corner of a mountain road with very limited visibility. Hmmmm, is this really a good idea, given the way Ecuadorians drive? I ask myself. And why are we stopping here anyway? The guide hops nimbly out of the vehicle, I fall out. He starts to climb a small, overhanging cliff, reaches up and picks something off the wall of the cliff. I can’t quite see what it is, due to the veil of water that is dripping down in front of the overhang. He comes back down with his precious haul and opens his hand to reveal two of the cutest baby hummingbirds that you ever did see. He pulls out his notebook, ruler and balance and starts taking measurements of the birds. He then places them gently into the palm of my hand and I have a little teary moment. These tiny, delicate, gorgeous creatures are just sitting there, looking up at me, turning me into one big, soft smile. There goes my heart again, melting into a little pile of goo. A bird in the hand may be worth two in the bush, but two baby hummers in the hand are priceless.

The next day, my mother had me help out in the kitchen making dinner. We were having fish stew. Blah. I wanted pancakes. So after making fish stew together-and I learned how to clean and gut fish that day--my mother had me get the ingredients for making pancakes and told me what to do. And by the time I was done making my stack of pancakes under my mother's watchful eye, the stew was ready. And for the rest of my time at home, I would help make dinner. My brothers would join in to from time to time, but I was the one who mostly enjoyed working in the kitchen.

WE have a Carbon Tax that no one wants, a Mining Tax that has those in the industry are screaming that will do more damage and ruin jobs and a so-called Prime Minister whose numbers are sinking faster than the Titanic.
Now, you may be smirking at our little pit stop, but I haven’t even shared the part where we went through the McDonald’s drive-thru for dessert. Oh yes, it gets better and better. Our low brow natures (well, his at least) got the best of us. He got a vanilla ice cream cone and I got the Oreo McFlurry. McYummy! (I think all those items at the galleries that I pointed out would be a great investment/make the room look smashing/I can’t live without/etc. made him feel like he needed to be thrifty for the remainder of the evening.)
One thing about using pastel sticks is that they are super difficult to use, because of the initial feeling it gives when you scratch the stick on the paper surface… imagine the screeching sound when you drag something sharp on glass surfaces. Okay, maybe not that extreme but close enough. And after you smudge it, there will be fine particles which can be annoying, especially if you accidentally brush against them and create an unnecessary smudge. Or perhaps it’s my first time using it so I’m probably not used to it. The one good thing is the ease of smudging especially when you want to cover a large surface area :D

When you’ve overcome a deep level of anxiety (no matter how irrational it might be), everyday worries can really lose their sting. I know there’ll be times in the future when I’m afraid or overwhelmed, but I also know that I have the ability to quickly recover and move on into a peaceful state just through the power of my own thoughts and actions. This is an amazing knowledge to have.

As the son of a head of state Kim Jong Un could have become known to be a gambler or a playboy like so many of his other peers whether they were his brothers or the son’s of other secular dictators such as Gaddafi’s sons or Saddam’s son’s. Even though the temptations were there he never succumbed to them and instead pursued his studies so that he could return to his homeland and be there for his people in case his father was no longer able to lead. The mainstream media in the U.S. is laughing and celebrating the death of Kim Jong Il, they are mocking Kim Jong Un for his age, he is only 29 and it is believed that someone so youthful could not be a leader. The fact that all previous history when it comes to the greatest leaders of all time prove the contrary whether is was Alexander, Julius Caesar, Lenin, Mao, Stalin and numerous others who were only able to see the bigger picture because the entanglements of the world that come with old age especially in democracies did not hinder their visions, that is a history lesson that the media would never teach.
The question keeps echoing in my head all afternoon. I know what he means. It feels like we should be doing something. When you are sick, it feels like you should do something to fix it.

Is he scared of dying? Am I scared of dying?

It doesn’t take much to ignore what goes on in this world when we feel secure in our expensive homes in gated communities, and suburban wealthy neighborhoods. If we don’t see it then it doesn’t matter to us… If a child is hit by a car and a private ambulance comes to get the person who was driving and leaves the child to die, then releases the person later with no injuries, shows that money as it exists now is more than life! Firefighters watch many homes burn because of the lack of insurance, or maybe the water is so expensive they cant waste it on an uninsured home… are we serious?

I let my son pick out a snack when we were at the grocery store this morning, and he picked out a jar of pickles. I hadn't bought a jar of pickles probably in years, and I figured since they're made from cucumbers, they're probably healthier than a lot of other snacks he could have chosen. As I was making his lunch later in the day, I pulled a pickle out for myself and munched on it. I was curious about how many calories it had, so I looked and the label, and I was surprised to see that it had zero! I guess I shouldn't have been so surprised; as I said, pickles are made from cucumbers after all. But still, I thought it would have at least some calories. Wow, I thought. So during those times when I'm cutting back on sugar and other refined and artificial ingredients, but am craving something salty or savory rather than sweet fruit, I could try a pickle, and will have eaten no calories! It seemed too good to be true. Then I though about something I read about water recently. When you drink water, there are no calories, but since your body uses calories to metabolize the water, it actually has negative calories. This may not be a new concept to you, and I know I've heard of it before too, but somehow it struck me differently this time, and I wanted to look into it a little more.
Comment #5... Congrats Jen!!
I could probably write a little bit more about how I enjoyed the way that the training scenes have both subverted and played straight the tropes of shonen training moments, but I still have to write about Glee (one of the best episodes of the season), a concert write-up for work (The Boxer Rebellion), and I also have to do a write-up for an interview for work that I should have done this week but I’ve been too sick. Plus, I just realized that I’ve had the same three movies at home from Netflix for like two months now and I need to watch them so I feel like I’m getting my money’s worth from that company. It’s kind of ridiculous just how far behind I’ve allowed myself to fall there. I’ve been busy with work (which makes me not want to do a ton of writing when I’m home), plus I’ve been playing a lot of Xenoblade Chronicles lately. Like a ton. I think I’m already close to the 30 hour mark in the game (and hilariously not very far in the actual main story for that many hours). So, let’s just say that despite my concerns about where the story could be going, I’m still really into Bleach and I hope it stays that way for a while.

Not to be outdone Sainsbury's also had some of their "Taste the Difference" beers on special offer over the Easter weekend. Two in particular caught my eye, so I decided to purchase them. The first was Porter, whilst the other was Celebration Ale. I've yet to try the latter, which is a 6.0% dark beer from Black Sheep, (unusual for then to be brewing an ale of this sort). However, I have sampled the Porter which is brewed by Shepherd Neame. Many of you will know that I am not a huge fan of Sheps but to give credit where it's due their Porter is a cracking beer. I'm not sure if it's the same beer that was available on draught some 10-15 years ago, which allegedly had liquorice root added to the copper, but tasting notes for this 5.0% bottled version describes the beer as having "intense spicy liquorice flavours alongside chocolate ones". It was certainly a good example of the style.

“My sister and I, however, were about as ‘normal’ as any two teenagers could be. We were at the top of our classes in school; both of us had lots of friends, participated in extra curricular activities. We didn’t need ‘therapy.’ We were told we would get a day off from school after each overnight stay at the clinic for this LSD. It was perhaps the prospect of a day off from Catholic girls’ school that persuaded us to do it. I wasn’t aware of making a ‘decision.’ The purpose of this program was never explained. There were to be 10 sessions – once a week for 10 weeks. I believe they started in January 1960.

The most famous aspect of Athanasius’ canon of Scripture is the fact that his list of New Testament books is the earliest list that we have that is exactly right without expressing doubt about any of the canonical books. Another famous aspect of Athanasius’ canon of Scripture, however, was his attempt to follow the 22-book Hebrew canon. In doing so, he gets it mostly right, despite the fact that he omits Esther and counts Ruth separately from Judges. In particular, Athanasius explicitly rejected many of the so-called deuterocanonical books.

June 28th we broke our silence. Em picked up his guitar and spontaneously played a song, Morning Glory. Soon after, Cheryl wrote lyrics and the first song of the new era was born. The sound was different—simpler and more organic than before. We decided not to create any more CDs, but rather, simply record the songs and then place them on our blog with a story. No drawing, no formal process, and most importantly, no physical CD. It was to be “of-the-moment” and virtual.
So we found the first spot and started shooting some simple old school band promo shots while trying to come up with something more like my style.

Like most such radio stations, it is staffed entirely by volunteers, most of them working full time. Radio Allerton has often proved to be a valuable training ground for a number of today’s successful broadcasters and media staff, with several of its previous presenters using their experience to forge careers for themselves in both radio and TV. The current team includes 5 members – including myself – with more than 25 years’ service; 3 of them have been with the station from the outset.

In the eyes of Karen Bishop and other New Age lightworkers who have been working tirelessly to prepare for the ‘Shift’ (in human consciousness), the runup to our rendezvous with the heart of our Galaxy is a sign of our Ascension, ‘coming home’, maturing as a species. To the fearful, solstice 2012 could mean chaos, collapse of Earth systems, erratic solar and stellar behavior; even a physical shift in earth’s poles.
Ciaran had another go the next day and got it too. He was a little scared and carried on a treat (while still holding on and skiing beautifully, mind you) and when he came back in and asked what was wrong, he realised that nothing bad happened and it was actually fun! He was so proud of himself though.

It still needs a little tweaking but I am really liking the change.

Yet for all my desires, it’s only happened twice. Only two men have been able to see exactly how I want to be treated and been capable of delivering it. I get that dominance isn’t for everyone—if it were, my attempts to shimmy into a corset and latex skirt and slash a whip in the air would’ve probably either led me to a devoted husband or a career as a dominatrix by now. But for the most part, I’ve spent my time in the kinky world watching and waiting. I’ve always believed that good things come to those who wait, as facile as that might sound. I’m 24, and I’ve been waiting long enough, observing, staring, lusting after those women lucky enough to get taken over a man’s knee, to be tied up to a cross, to have a gag shoved in their mouth while they thrash around, knowing that they can’t escape until everyone gets what they need.

Ian, in the meantime was beginning to buckle under his own stress. He’s forming a new teen band for a March gig, composing a piece for his middle school band to perform (also due in March), and trying to coordinate study times with his Science Olympiad teammates, who have been very busy and difficult to get hold of (regionals are once again, in March). So many big projects, and so much to coordinate. He was feeling overwhelmed.

Over the course of time; I plan to, weekly, teach and share with you so many of the things that I have learned over the years about the Sacred and Solemn Music of the Holy Liturgy. I plan to share with you, the writings of the Great Saints of Sacred Music, such as St. Gregory the Great, and St. Cecilia. I will share some of my favorite composers such as Victoria, William Byrd, Palistrina, Taverner, Tallis, Mozart, Scarlotti, Bethoven, Hayden and many more. I will dissect the Papal documents on Sacred Music, such as Mediator Dei, Musicae Sacrae, Tra le Sollecitudini, Musicam Sacram, Sacrosanctum Concillium, De Musica Sacra et Sacra Liturgica and the GIRM. Which will allow us to understand just what makes the Music of the Liturgy so sacred. I will provide you all with resources from places, such as the Monks of Solemes, and the Church Music Association of America (CMAA). I will discuss Early Music, Gregorian Chant, and How it paved the way to Modern Music. You will learn to distinguish the Sacred from the Profane. What Monophonic and Polyphonic pieces are. What is edifying and enriching to the spirituality of the soul. The Sacred text, prayer, scripture, and Sacramental elements that make up the propers of the day. We will take a deep look into the mood of chant, how it fits into the Divine Office, and the rubrics music contains in the Holy Liturgy. I will discuss the Organ, Voice, and the supreme model, and how the Sacred Music has developed out of paganism. I will highlight the importance of the Latin Language. I will introduce The Motu Proprio on women in Sacred Music in 1908, its restrictions, the place for hymns in the Holy Mass, Sacred Silence. and what makes a piece Sacred, in regards to natural order, chord progression, its text, and rubrics put forth by the Holy Mother Church.

What is a reason for outrage is not the fact that the Tories have been found out to be taking this money but the fact that, throughout Sunday, David Cameron, and Party Chairman, Michael Fallon, appeared on TV News reports asserting that the comments by the Party Treasurer, were just bluster, and could not have happened. But, today we find out that it HAD happened as Cruddas had said. Money had changed hands, and meetings in Downing Street had taken place, and contrary to what Fallon seemed to be suggesting - though in the interview with Andrew Neill, on the Sunday Politics he was very evasive - these meetings had not been recorded. In fact, this morning, Downing Street are insisting that they will not provide details of these meetings!

In addition, concentrated fish farm waste leads to concentrations of “dead zones” around the fish cages–zones where the water is literally starved of oxygen and nutrients and where nothing can really live.

UPDATE: 1st October, 2011. Well this is beginning to have the makings of an entertaining spectacle: Paddy McKillen has, according to the Irish Independent today, “insisted he remains the largest shareholder in the group” and there are “suggestions” Paddy should have been given a right of first refusal in the sale of the loans and/or the sale of other shareholdings, notably Derek Quinlan’s. NAMA for its part is reported to be claiming that the sale of the loans is “closed”, that is to say, finalised, done-and-dusted. With Property Week yesterday claiming the Barclays controlled 64% of Maybourne’s equity and Paddy now apparently claiming to be the largest shareholder, it looks as if the drama predicted here on Thursday may unfold sooner rather than later.

That job would be perfect for me. It is what I have done for years, it has its irritations but I can make something of it, achieve something worthwhile, probably please the funders, take pleasure in it.

I applied for a job with them in June, so when they advertised they emailed me to let me know: Dear Clare, attaching my application letter and CV from last time.

While simply wanting, needing and acquiring less is both powerful and necessary, equally important is making structural and strategic reduction. Moving from a disposable society back to a repair society puts people back to work, enables more sustainable product design, and stops the avalanche of poorly designed, poorly made, and often toxic refuse that is pouring into our landfills. We also ignore what we have learned about ourselves. Long commutes are generally bad for our cognitive function and our happiness, yet we continue to build exurbs. Living in smaller dwelling has no appreciable effect on our happiness, yet we continue to build (and define the American dream in terms of) inefficient single-family dwellings.

It has taken me a few weeks to come around to writing this post. I have had to mentally adjust to having an almost toddler versus a baby. She's still a baby to me, and she'll always be our Baby Girl, but I know that she is now a one-year-old and her infant days are far behind us. These past two-and-a-half weeks I've been realizing what fun it is to spend my days with such a smart, funny, opinionated, optimistic, cheerful girl and not waste my time waxing nostalgic about when she was itty-bitty.

I signed up for this group about a month ago and was honestly worried about joining it for a different reason. I was pregnant and here I was joining a group for women who had just lost a baby. I was worried I'd upset them if I came out with my news so I wasn't planning on it. Well the surprise is on me now that I've lost them both.

Frank Gorshin really tries to bring the Riddler to life but he doesn’t have much to do. Still, in many ways Gorshin gives the most impressive performance in the film because the guy is totally committed to this character. Whether he’s at the front of a scene or lurking in the background, Gorshin always gives the Riddler something to do.

I just read a blog post that broke my heart - and really pissed me off, all at once. I had stop following this particular blogger a while back because I just couldn't take the self-absorbed whining any more. When I first started blogging and ran across her blog, I liked her voice and admired the things she wrote about her family and faith, as well as their commitment to mission work. Then somewhere along the way, I realized that sharing her thoughts was all a self-promotion thing and well, frankly, it turned me off. I stopped following a couple other look-at-me blogs around the same time - but every once in a while I get curious and check them out to see what I've missed. And today I read the post that hurt me to the depths of my soul. She actually wrote about her personal struggle with including a motherless, hungry child begging for attention with her own kids at playtime - and even worse, at meal time. Honestly, what person who professes to love God would have to think twice about inviting this lost soul in? And are we not supposed to give our gifts in private, so the Lord, who sees everything will reward us? I know, I'm judging - none of us is perfect, but don't shout to the rooftops (or the world wide web) what a good Christian you are if you are too blind to entertain an angel when God puts one right in front of you.

Plus, how do I know if I go to Brazil he’s not going to say, “You I want to see in Atlanta?” But I decided to go back a second day, and again I was one of two thousand new (and some repeat) visitors. Once again I watched person after person march by him in half a second, getting waved on to the healing room or the meditation room. And once again when I came before him the translator stopped me and said, “You he waits for in Brazil!” Needless to say, it gave me food for thought, but I never went.

I am pleased to share with you the latest book review of The Golden Pathway.
In 1846, therefore, when the bishops of the United States dedicated our land in a special manner to the Immaculate Conception, choosing the Blessed Virgin under this title as the special Patroness of our country, it was a re-dedication as far as that part was concerned which had once belonged to Spain-Our Spanish Borderlands, which were placed under the patronage of Mary Immaculate already in 1760.
But the film that then unfolds is about a mysterious assassin at loose in Clare’s house, and Clare himself has now switched to oil painting. Only at the end does the significance of the pre-credits sequence come into focus, leading to an extraordinarily left-field plot twist that will either delight or infuriate, depending on your taste in such matters. (This finale, what’s more, is set up by a scene ten minutes in that seems meaningless and is soon forgotten about: audiences only notice it on a second viewing.)

Alright, so (before we continue to our topic) Angelina is NOT naturally-skinny at all. In fact, being a model requires losing weight (HAHAH, you nailed it, Tyra Banks!). Angelina is very fleshy before she became an actress. The real reason why she’s skinny is because of stress, coming from work (name it: motherhood, shooting, hectic schedules). Oh, and I’m never a fan of skinny girls with boobies (y’know what I mean! Well, I’d spare Asia Argento because she’s got a booty).

Finally, in August 2010, there was a big international conference at YIISA, including over 100 presentations.

Today I decided to film and go swimming and bring my camera along for the ride and I did. I am just waiting for my batteries to recharge so I can edit and upload it to youtube and share my day with you. I was tempted to do a Ellen dance dare but it’s kind of hard when I’m alone with a baby in a stroller and no one to hold the camera for me. haha

3. Most Popular- Well, it would probably have to be when I was Freshly Pressed for the one above, but honestly, Wisdom Teeth Removal Removes Wisdom, has been very successful with google searchers. It’s been viewed 9,200 times. It’s amazing how people google this, especially after Christmas. It must be a great time to get your wisdom teeth taken out.

I actually get butterflies in my stomach even with the thought of having to make a phone call. Be it as petty as calling my best buddy to getting anything organised by calling the help desk of any utility. Now you can guess it well, how severe my state is. I decided to write about it to be able to get a clearer picture of what exactly has been causing all this in past years.
BTC normally play in blue and white stripes. However, this clashes with our blue and black kit, so today they wear a red number with yellow trim. It has more than a whiff of Melchester Rovers about it. Although any further association with Roy of the Rovers is quashed by BTC’s insistence on swearing at the referee whenever they feel a foul has been awarded against them unfairly. It is unlikely that Roy’s moral compass would have allowed that kind of behaviour on his watch, even if it did seem that BTC were later denied what seemed to be a certain penalty.

Sheri and I had been dating for a month or two at that time and she was fully aware of my juvenile ways so her quick reflexes allowed her to easily pull away and slap my face in the span of a few seconds. “Jason Stevens,” she indignantly yelled back at me, “what have I said about you treating me this way in public.”

After having the beautiful capsicum and zucchini dish out on Mothers Day, I knew I wanted to cook some up for myself for the week. I spent an hour chopping sauteeing vegetables and was able to add it to just about every meal so far this week. It was a worthwhile payoff. The mushrooms got left behind though. I recognise them for their individuality and being a cool fungi and everything but they just don't do it for me. They are alien and not in the good way.
Looking on the tags and reading the info I decided the Dancy was the type my grandparents must have had; it was the only Tangerine tree that said it was sensitive to freezing temperatures. The others weren't as sensitive to freezing temperatures but they also didn't grow as big. I wanted the same kind of tree my grandparents had. No other would do. And based on the info I had I decided the Dancy had to be my tree.

I’m sure we have all experienced those moments in life where you’ve wished you could step outside of yourself and kick your own butt. Yes, me too. Recently, during a drive back home after what was an awkward meeting with an old flame, I said to myself: “why did you just put yourself through that?” I resigned myself to the fact that I owed myself some answers. We’ve all been guilty of it at one time or another—picking at the proverbial scab on a wound that was ever so close to being healed. For whatever reason, I convinced myself that revisiting the situation was a good idea, and flawed logic reigned supreme.
Wavves and Best Coast go hand in hand lately. This is the surf-punk title-track from Wavves' latest and greatest LP so far.
But in the end, Dr. Nick made a nice scapegoat when people wanted someone to blame for Elvis’s death. There had to be someone to point the finger at when people wanted answers. And unfortunately that person was Dr. Nick. This book also highlights the power of public opinion versus facts presented.

Thankfully, she was right when she told me that "they can't kill an old horse." Over eight months later, she is still going strong. And... still pumping out the meatballs and sauce.

Although it is easy to put down those of us from the past for our resounding racial cluelessness, I have to ask: where are all the public city swimming pools now, for working class kids (of whatever race) to go to? There are few-to-none here (mostly YMCA and YWCA), and from all I have been able to discern, public swimming pools are mostly a thing of the past. Middle-class kids go to pools in their friend's backyards. (I never knew anyone who had an outdoor pool when I was growing up; city yards are notoriously small and there wouldn't have been enough room, even if you had wanted one.) Segregation is not over, it has been taken private and local. If you don't have the money for an expensive membership to the Y, if you don't know someone with an outdoor pool or live in a suburban enclave or apartment complex that provides one for its members, you don't swim.
Twelver Shi'as cite various references from the Qur'an and reports (Hadith) from Muhammad and the twelve Shi'a Imams. These texts predict the reappearance of Muhammad al-Mahdi which would, in accordance with God's command, bring justice and peace to the world by establishing Islam throughout the world.
I’m not sure where she had gone, but Katherine wasn’t in the cabin one afternoon while we were having “rest period.” We’d seen her writing in her diary, and my friends Kelly, Mary and I went snooping around for it. It wasn’t hard to find wedged in between her mattress and the frame of the bunk bed. We seized it and started scanning it for anything worth making fun of. There were a few passages about some boy she’d had a crush on at school. “Jason smiled at me today in the hall.” “Jason asked to borrow my pen.” And the saddest: “Jason threw a tennis ball at me today after lunch. I think he likes me.” But the entry that REALLY made us howl was the one about her cat “Puff” that had gotten hit by a car and killed. For some reason, that story really tickled our collective funny bone—especially when read aloud while doing our best Katherine impersonations, complete with stuck out teeth and a horse neigh or two thrown in. We were horrible. Eventually Katherine found out that we’d violated her privacy and, justifiably, threw a fit. She told our counselors, and once again, I received a talking to. After that, she spent more and more time at the stables and as little time as possible with us.

In mid November I went to a routine checkup with my doctor. I told her that I had on occasion been experiencing chest pains that made me concerned about what was going on in my heart. She gave me an in office EKG and noticed that I had an irregular heartbeat – I believe that she called it a “bundle branch block” she said that because of my family history of heart problems she wanted me to undergo a nuclear stress test to look more closely at what was going on in my heart. I knew from my childhood that I have had an irregular heartbeat for quite some time, I mentioned this to her, so she had previous EKGs pulled the following day which confirmed that this was something that has been an ongoing issue and was not a major concern but was more of my “signature” heartbeat. I decided that what I was experiencing was probably just me feeling flutters and muscle issues from lifting heavy things, etc. but I decided to go thru with the test just to make sure – providentially our health insurance deductible being met was a deciding factor in me getting the stress test because the doctor didn’t really think that I had anything serious going on at my age.

The upper district court in Düsseldorf has published an interesting decision (I2 U 92/10) in preliminary injunction procedure. The defendant had argued that the patentee abused his position dominating the market such that a compulsory licence to the patent would have to be granted - with the consequence that the cease and desist claim of the patentee would not be enforcible by referring to the "Microsoft" judgement of the European Court.
Although Marcus Guttenberg had visited Derby briefly in 1852 (Adamson, 1997), the town's first permanent photographer of the 1850s appears to have been James Brennen who is reported to have "[taken] up Daguerreotype and turned out portraits as good as could be found at the time" in 1854 (Keene, 1886, in Birks, 1934), or perhaps even slightly earlier in 1853 (Craven, 1993). It seems likely, however, that he would have adopted the collodion positive process by early 1855, when both he and Edmund Stowe were listed in a trade directory as "photographic artists" (Kelly, 1955).

The group, which takes in revenue north of $300,000 annually, mostly from dues, is by far the dominant parenting organization in town. (The latest census data show only about 40,000 young children in the city.) G.G.M.G. offers three core benefits to members. It acts as an information exchange, where pediatrician recommendations, hiring of nannies and admission tips to private preschools are particularly popular topics. It negotiates discounts for members at local retailers and service providers. So shortly after taking home his new son in February, the banker sought to join the group. “Everyone who knows about it talks about how great it is,” he said in an interview.He was rebuffed. An e-mail signed by the G.G.M.G. Membership Committee informed him that “to be a member, you must be a woman.” What's most sad about this, is that this man's son -- not the most disadvantaged little boy, it is true -- nonetheless is the one who will miss out on the the benefits of getting to drool and slobber around thousands of other infants and toddlers. His primary caretaker is a guy, so he won't get to hang with these kids. Which demonstrates that this organization is not about kids, it's about their mothers. Exclusively. And that is a problem.

“I don’t understand half of what you said, but I think I got the gist,” Ronan said. “Basically, Cairn was an evil witch who enjoyed his powers over mostly evil creatures. He died, and the new witch is just the opposite. Everything she does flies in the face of her predecessor – kinda like me. All this wouldn’t be a problem, except for the fact that Mara’s alive and watching, and everything Genesis does mocks Cairn, the man she loved.”

When I emigrated from South Africa, first to Israel and then to America I had idealized images of both countries. I naively thought that I was moving to countries with much greater freedom and equality than in South Africa. In Israel I had to confront the dispossession of the Palestinians and the systemic discrimination against Palestinians both in Israel and in the Occupied Territories. And in America I had to confront the engrained institutionalized racism of this country.

I don't know if there's anything "recognizably Mexican" in the Sinfonía Romántica in particular. (It's worth noting, perhaps, that the piece was a Louisville Symphony Orchestra commission.) But we do know that Chavez was a key musical figure in Mexico — not just as a composer of seven symphonies, a number of ballets, chamber pieces, and other works, but also as a journalist and a leader of major Mexican musical institutions. And I've heard that Chavez was interested in Native American music; themes have been identified in Chavez's other works, including his Symphony No. 2, the Sinfonía India (1935-6). In a fascinating set of pre-concert lecture notes from 1960, Bernstein seemed to define Chavez's Mexicanness in the Romántica in terms of stereotypes — as a blend of Indian austerity (and here Bernstein mentioned Aztec idols) with Latin passion (and here Bernstein crossed out a passage about Spanish olive oil).
At a time when this country was facing serious domestic and international problems Blair and his wretched government set off in pursuit of a fox. Rather, they set off in pursuit of fox hunters, determined in a mood of urban spite to stop hunting with hounds, to end an ancient rural custom. I don’t imagine one in ten Labour MPs gave a damn about the welfare of the fox. They were like the seventeenth century puritans who, as T. B. Macaulay said, hated bear baiting, not because it gave pain to the bears, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators.

I’m pretty sure I know why. The teenager down the road drives his red Ford Ranger way too fast past me when I’m riding, and it is super dangerous, and he is probably going to kill himself doing this when my horse suddenly decides to jump in front of his truck at short notice.

The expedition began in June when Lt. Gov. and veteran soldier Pedro de Villasur was appointed by New Mexico Gov. Antonio Valverde to lead a Spanish army into central Nebraska to investigate French ambitions in territory that Spain claimed. The expedition 600 miles away included more than 40 soldiers and more than 60 Indian allies. Villasur, 34 of his soldiers, and 11 Pueblo scouts were killed in an attack by Pawnee Indians – who were allied with the French – after they crossed onto the North Platte River in August of that year. The Spanish called the North Platte the Rio de San Lorenzo, and they called the South Platte the Rio Jesus María.

Between 1942 and 1944, the Germans built an extensive system of coastal fortifications along the western coast of Europe, from the Spanish border to northern Norway, as a means of preventing - or at least delaying - the anticipated Allied invasion of mainland Europe from Great Britain. The system was known as the Atlantikwall and, by June 1944, it comprised of almost 15,000 bunkers with over 3,000 guns.

The kind of book that makes you stop and take notice of things around you that you would not otherwise stop and take notice of.

For the "L" I used various ribbons, lace, flowers, and bling that I had in my stash. The banner is three layers, the scallop 5" , the regular 5", and then a smaller cut of the regular 3" -- all from Birthday Bash. The "L" is the shadow and regular script cut from the Elegant Cake cartridge. I stamped the background of my regular pennant cut with Tim Holtz's script stamp, and then embossed it with white embossing powder. The flowers are from Making Memories and Recollections. The bling is from Kaisercraft, and the ribbons and pearls are from Offray and the $1 collection at JoAnn Fabrics. The small heart charm on the L was a gift (it says made with love).

The basic story (for those who don’t know) is that Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) was the son of a fishing magnate. The family travelled from Liverpool to New England, when Barnabas was a child, and founded the town of Collinsport. One of their servants, Angelique (Eva Green), fell in love with Barnabas but, despite a dalliance with her, he was in love with one Josette DuPres (Bella Heathcote). Angelique, however, was a witch. She killed his parents and then caused Josette to throw herself from a cliff into the sea and turned Barnabas into a vampire as he threw himself off the same cliff (I actually thought it might have been nice to make his suicide the source of the vampirism, but nevermind). She then had him captured by an angry mob and chained in a coffin that was then buried in the woods – cut to the 1970s and workmen dig up the coffin.

The making of the beer was troubled. The cereal mashed spelt, which had turned into thick goo, clogged the mash tun false bottom once added to the main mash.

Emotional goal: This goal has been met. The anxiety I wanted to reduce was all related to the transition of moving to Tampa and the possibility that I just wouldn’t be able to cut it. Now that I’ve put in some hard work, I see that I am more than capable. I just have to keep pushing!

In 1851 the Great Exhibition was held in Hyde Park. The main exhibition hall was the Crystal Palace, vast glass structure which was dismantled after the Exhibition and was relocated and reassembled in Sydenham (south London). It burned down in 1936.
After the two video versions I posted (here and here) here is a third version of this song dedicated to Zani himself. This is from the same concert and recorded by the same person as #3. Attentive listeners may have noticed that this is in fact the same song as "Bomama" by Super Biton. In his solo, after 3'08, Zani does a series of acrobatics, rolling on the floor and sliding his guitar underneath his body. Alou's singing after the solo, however, is somewhat below par. This song does give a good impression of the reception the band got from Dutch audiences.

Poor Ganga wants to protect her father from the truth about what happened in the US, considering that Kishorilal is his BFF and in leaving out a few key details (attempted rape) she and Arjun become the focus of Suraj Dev’s rage, for after all, a returned bride-to-be is a dirty thing in India.Wow Dad, so harsh! But you know who WON’T let his chaste Ganga be defiled with cruel lies or be hit by her own father!? Arjun! And here things get HOT! SRK goes full-blown crazy, cutting himself with a gigantic saber by pulling it by the blade from Suraj Dev’s furious hands!

Karna had a brother called Hjutal. He died a year and a half ago on Rori. he had travelled there to talk to Khuure about her upcoming heartpartner trial. A local gang killed him. Karna is now the only child in his family. Karna and Hjutal are cousins to Khuure. Their fathers are brothers. Karna’s father is Piki. Khuure’s father is Khamar.

Finally, today I ran a 10K in Mukilteo with hopes of working on my speed a little more. I had hoped for sub 52 minutes, but could only manage 52:46 (about 8:30 pace). My first three miles went quite well, but I struggled in the second half. (Averaging was my savior.). That could be because the first half was a downhill grade, and the second half had more uphills...also, it was getting warm! No pictures, no age group award (the top three in my AG were sub-50...quite rightly). I did about 1.5 miles warm-up before, and half a mile after, for a total of about 8.2 miles today.
Have you heard of the Kohana brand before? This is a brand I recently discovered because of their Kona Coffee Body Polish in particular. I have been on the hunt for a great smelling coffee scrub, and I've had many failed attempts along the way. Then comes Kohana's Kona Coffee Body Polish and my search is over; it is such a true and perfect coffee smell! Their Coffee Butter Creme smells great too. I also tried their Bamboo Lemongrass Moisturizing Body Wash, but wasn't a huge fan of the scent so I gave it to a friend to test and she loves it. Overall, I have a great impression of this brand!
Again, if the captain’s top tube wasn’t so darn long I’d have snapped this baby up a long time ago.
Nevertheless, as he approached manhood (around 19) he began to realize the he could no longer be Hadrian’s lover because of public opinion and because Hadrian preferred younger boys; therefore, Antinous decided to sacrifice himself to the gods and the man he loved. At least that is how the story goes, for no one really knows for certain.
There’s an honesty in something blurted out—not conditioned, preconceived, qualified, sanitized or nuanced—if you respond with the first thing that pops into mind. The “true” inner voice speaks out with transparency. Most of the time, it’s surprising what brilliance and beauty hides behind the well-considered, “politically correct” reply. Unfortunately, our most creative ideas may never even see the light of day because, frankly, we may think too much. So there you have it—a bit of spontaneity in writing, untouched by the spin doctor.
I guess this is just some fancy stuff, a make-believe people say.

And so, whilst battling the wind, I really tried to achieve race pace for 4 minutes at a time. By race pace I think I’am aiming for between 8 and a half and 9 minute mile pace. With the minute walks that should be around a 10 minute mile. Mr Garmin shows that I was a bit slower than that, no surprise really. The huge gap in my time was when I was stopped by a lorry driver asking for directions!
I tried to tell him I could drive him home, but he wouldn’t have it. He said he was going to go over to the tavern across from the train station to have a few drinks. I just couldn’t believe my luck. Sometimes when you meet your destiny, obstacles just jump out the way to let you pass. I got Jon good and drunk that night. I had just got my unemployment check in and I just about spent it all on whiskey and buds. When the bar was closing, I helped the manager carry Jon upstairs. I knew the guy well, we had gone to high school together way back when. He nodded to me, asking me silently if I could take it from here ‘cause he had his wife and kids to get home too. I nodded back, of course.
Moaz displays understanding of nuance, can approach many issues (doubless well read), now put the words into action and set the strategy for the rest of Pakatan’s dullard politicians. A visionary and useful article but too constrained due to inbuilt fears caused by Capitalist (cutthroat society) mentality as well as neglect to address nepotism and oligarchy as well as unlimited term careerists in Pakatan. Most glaringly no address of apartheid – crypto-racism is not a good stance, so declare stands on equality for all.

We just burned our last bag of fossil fuel. The newly delivered firewood has to be stacked inside the old dog pen. It is perfect for the purpose as it has tall wood-framed sides lined in stiff wire, sitting on a dry concrete slab. I am going to put some pvc hoops across the top to form a tunneled roof support and cover them with sheet plastic. We thought about using it as a mini-greenhouse but it is better as a wood store right outside the back door. We used to burn the smokeless compressed coke that gives off tons of heat over a long period, costs a bomb, and leaves useless toxic ashes. We are now using sustainable wood that leaves a lovely ash residue. The ashes will now be used for a potassium additive in the soil.
We’ll adapt, we always do. Only the strong survive, and in 1 way or another, WE DO need to earn our food through some form of exercise. Extreme exercise may not be practical, but it is possible. I live in the USA, nothing is a right even though it is advertised as such. It is a privilege.

Hmmm, her pulse rate is climbing, and her blood pressure, while initially high, has fallen dramatically. I open up her drip, and give her more fluids, willing the ambulance faster.
My daughter Jasmine and her fellow pupils at Echelford Primary School have been eagerly waiting for this date since last summer when the Voice In A Million project first came to light. They have been practising tirelessly under the tutor ledge of their choir master Mr Bruce and joined other schools on the night to form a mass choir of 4,000 voices (the current number of children in the UK awaiting adoption), who would back a series of soloists throughout the night.

The Legal Aid attorney, whose salary was paid by a national charity undermining the local economy, told me, “The tenant has a right to have someone live with her if she wants to.” That was a discussion we should have offered up before any reasonable judge, because she’s right, but only if the other person living there is on the Lease.

Basically Sarah picks 1 inspirational item (this week it's bedding) and you build a room around it. It can be any room/style/color palette you want - the only caveat is that it uses the challenge item. How fun! And what a great way to dream up a room around all those items I love but can't afford in this real world with budgets and other pesky details.

Publishing – what is with all the bitching and fighting? Can’t we all get along? It isn’t about size, or how we present our words, it’s about words. Digital or traditional, words are simply our tools. My words are my tool. As you are reading this, it’s like I am putting my tool inside you. My book is my tool. I want to put my tool in as many people as possible. I want you to tell people about me. I guess what I am saying is I want to be in your mouth. Okay, I agree, mine may biggest or thickest tool. But my tool has satisfied many people. I have had people say “Oh it was good, I loved it” I have then had their mothers begging to have my tool in them too. But, it’s okay, I don’t mind if you want to get your teeth into someone else’s more meaty tool, I’m happy to share. I do believe everyone has a book inside them. While I had mine surgically removed, I still love books, they touch that inner child we have inside all of us. Regardless of age, we all have that inner child. So lets stop arguing about what to love, and enjoy love. The love of reading. A love of books. Let’s stop fighting and let me put my tool in you and and let me touch your child.

We reached toward Keyport and when the wind came far enough off the bow, we set the spinnaker and ran in to the passage to Liberty Bay. Again, the wind ahead was shifty and the targets on our backs were showing for the boats behind. The wind picked up as we entered Liberty Bay and the boats behind closed up on us. Dulcinea and Carmanah finished close enough to us to beat us by about 35 seconds after Dulcinea edged out Carmanah for first in class by about 6 inches! Blackout was fourth in class while still trying to figure out their boat and Ole on Tantalus was fifth, probably due to bad luck. Overall, the Division II boat, Emerald Lady(Catalina 27) was first overall and Swan(Thunderbird 26) was second overall.

"Nowadays I say to the rest of the lads: Take my name off the list, lads, put me on the reserve list – only to be called up in dire emergency. Then, after an afternoon in the sun by a swimming-pool with all these young bodies hanging in and out of bikinis, I say: Lads, you've got to put me back on the list. And I'll be called up to action. Oh! Oh! The battles that are fought throughout the Holiday-Inns of America! Delightful."

I rested my feet a few days thinking 'hey, maybe I'm overtraining' and then went back to my oldies. The old shoes were fine but my feet still hurt some on my 10 mile run on Saturday (towards mile 7/8). On Sunday, the hubs and I saw a running store while we were downtown and he talked me into getting measured and fitted for running shoes. I bought a pair I liked that were super comfy and tried them out this morning. Mistake #2. I was supposed to run 5-6 miles this morning and I made it 3. The balls of my feet were KILLING me! There was no way I could make my full run without seriously messing my feet. So these shoes are going back and I may exchange them for something else (the running store only gives store credit instead of refunds) and/or I may just wear my old running shoes for the rest of my training. I have 2 1/2 weeks left until the race and at this point, I will be lucky if I just make it across the finish line. For a while I thought I was going to be able to make a good time but now I'm not so sure. I am extremely frustrated with the whole situation and angry that my feet are betraying me. The shoe issues have made me want to give up training but I have come so far and am definitely a way better runner than I was when I started in December/January that I don't want to give up. I think I am just going to have to accept that my feet will hurt some during the race and I need to suck it up and deal.
When filtered through Cowell’s rather “maverick” sensibilities,
Who killed the 13-year old girl, the girl that got the plot going? Does Joseph find the culprit? Is finding the culprit the climax of the book, OR is it the fact he can't find the culprit what leads him to begin a campaign to protect other girls who might be in danger? And how does he know which girls are in danger? And if he can't find the culprit, what's the climax of the book?

It was an early start, 8.30am, and standing around waiting to start was absolutely freezing (Spring weather? Pfft!). I couldn’t quite get my head around how some people were rocking up in shorts and crop tops when it felt like it was barely 1 degree celsius. I rather loudly (and unintentionally) remarked upon the fact that I could see one of the elite women’s abs from a distance of 30 metres which provoked several female heads around me to crane forward trying to catch sight of said woman who was quite too skinny for my mind to be easy about it. The elite women set off first, followed by the elite men, then the 8 mile racers and lastly us 16-milers. I was pleased to finally get the body warm! It’s a gorgeous flat race, 2 laps of 8 miles, which heads out past Hampton Court Palace along the river, into molesey and then back again into Kingston itself. I ran with SuperSarah as Dash was ill (not due to any drink might I add) after a hectic Hen do which she put a lot into organising for a friend the day before.

Sometimes people are so blinded by their anger, ignorance and fear that they are unwilling to see the facts or listen to reason. With the sheer number of Pit Bulls out there, logically if you follow the rationale of the "anti's", we should be reading about attacks every hour on the hour. I mean if they really are this vicious then surely people would be killed left and right, Pit Bulls would be running rampant in the streets attacking people. But that clearly isn't the case.

Sandi's base yarn is a very nice wool nylon blend that holds the colors well and is great for sock making as well as any other item where you want soft wool yet the added nylon for durability and some spring!

It's quieter in there, our senses are deprived of the hubbub of the classroom, brought alive instead by the other people with whom we are now in enclosed proximity, breathing their steamy breath, smelling of skin, soap, fabric softener, breakfast, sounding muffled and intimate when they speak, a shadow barely visible in the faint light leaking through the cracks.

Being that I knew the story well, I could mentally fill in the blanks with what WASN'T being shown in the movie (they couldn't cover everything, you know). For example, even though it wasn't shown, I knew Katniss had a hard time finding water in the first several days. They just skipped that part in the movie, she was contentedly filling her canteen in a pond within minutes of the start of the games. To be honest, it wasn't a huge part of the story...except to provide some time setting.

When I was a kid I used to write on paper. When there were too many erasures, I would rewrite the whole thing and then add the next part of the story. Having to delete and revise is easier on the computer. I like seeing things neat. When I re-read something, I have to feel the flow, and I don’t get to do that when there are too many erasures that I have to skip through. Sometimes I would also need to insert another paragraph, so I would put an asterisk or other signs wherever the paragraph needed to be inserted, then write the new paragraph on another piece of paper. This became problematic because if I had to flip through several pages, looking for the inserted paragraph, this disrupts my ability to gauge the flow of the article or story. Cut and paste commands on the computer makes things simpler.
I’m not forgoing the internet, but I will be on it less than I am now, even for writing purposes. I will be using pen and paper (feel free to gasp in horror), and of course getting air and exercise. I’m pale as paper, and while I don’t tan, I could certainly do with more colour than I have now. If I didn’t have dark eyes and hair, you’d think I had a medical condition of some sort. Sun screen will be a must on my outdoor excursions.

I know that I've grown up being treated like a princess. I am sensitive and temperamental and I've got my head up in the clouds and I'm girlish and immature and finicky and if I can't get it my way, I sulk and panic and lock myself away in the tower that is my perfectly furnished bedroom. I'm so undateable.

Then on the bus home there was a lot of people. On the back row there was me, Elliott, some guy who I don’t know the name of but is friends with Elliott, Sybie, and her friend. Then there was Luca and Andrew M in front of Sybie and friend, then Chris and Lottie in front of them, and next to them was Tom and Ellie S! I can’t remember a time when I’ve been on the bus with so many people :) Rob the Maths Teacher was on it to, and Chris said jokingly in a loud voice, “So Tom, shall we talk about Peru?” ;) I asked Luca to see if Chris and Lottie were holding hands, so he, very subtle (not), stood up, faked yawned, stretching, and sat back down, then nodded at me, which every one found very funny, especially me and Elliott (the stretching, not the nodding). I was the only one who knew why he did it though, but I did tell Elliott later. When he and his friend got off the bus, I moved up closer to Sybie and her friend. When her friend got off in Partridge Green, Me and Sybie preceded to have a whispered conversation about the 2 couples on the bus, and what we thought and suspected about them. Apparently, from what I could tell, Lottie hadn’t treated her previous boyfriend very well since they broke up. She said they would remain friends, but hasn’t made any effort to do this. They were together for about 2 years, but only officially for about 8-12 months, and they kept that quiet too. From what Sybie was saying, her boyfriend, Nicholas, went to her school. Her school was an all-girls school. Now, I’m pretty sure he is a guy at the moment, so basically I believe he is a transsexual. I had heard rumours of this today from Luca and Kieran. Sybie reckoned Lottie just wanted to have a normal relationship. With Chris.
I know exactly why this particular person would even want to slander me. I mean, obviously, it’s not Islamically correct. But, I can actually see, in hindsight, why someone, particularly & especially a Muslim, would ever want to slander me, with the accusation of Homosexuality, no less.

This is my classic example of what man brewers do wrong when making a pale ale, they have the wrong flavor profile when brewing and it comes out tasting kinda soapy. Not that I spent a good portion of my childhood with a bar of soap in my mouth being punished for swearing (which I was, just no soap), or that I have licked a bar or soap or two in the past... but it just doesn't have the most appealing taste. Its not bad by any means, but if you are going to stop after one glass, before your drunk, you are probably not going to care for this beer too much in the long run.
I think it's taken me this long to write this post because I was in denial. I felt like acknowledging that I am done is somewhat of a failure on my part. I still feel that way a little bit. Not to mention the fact that I figured people would think, "Who the hell cares?! Sayonara! You really are self-involved!" The blog is like a long-term relationship that I couldn't quite shake, but right now I feel like I can say that I'm done.

You may be wondering what it is I am postulating, and I shall indeed attempt to explain. In my previous article on the Rothschilds, I quoted from a story published in a British newspaper which asserted that the family had financed both Britain and France during the latter stages of the Napoleonic Wars. The same piece also quoted Nathan Rothschild thus:
52 The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; 54 he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 56 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. 57 As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me.

While you are doing all of this, be on the lookout for a dedicated crit partner. This is someone that you work closely with. They read your stuff and you read theirs. It can take a lot of trail and error and starts and stops before you find someone that will stick with you and support you and you will do the same for them.

I heard this story the other night. It was about an older couple. They have lived their lives. They made it to the end. I don’t know the exact details of how they lived their lives, but this story is telling of the love they shared…We’ll call the wife Rose and the husband Bud.
There was a wedding the next day. Not theirs, theirs was ages ago. The bride was beautiful and the music was nice and the kids were cute and the priest was crass. The usual, all good. He played nice at the table and ate too much and waned after a fashion and retreated upstairs to watch Match of the Day and drink scotch on his own. An hour or so later she texted to say that she missed him. Not that he was being antisocial and inconsiderate, just that she missed him. He told her that he was finding socialising hard at the moment and she told him that she'd mind him.
Earlier this year, the boys over at Community Gum busted 5 Jumbo cases of 2012 Topps. That is not a typo. I think I might actually get tired of busting packs before that was over. At any rate, after busting all those Jumbos, they sent in the wrappers and ended up with 21 of the Gold Rush Packs. Wouldn't you know it, they pulled some cards I like. I mailed them a little envelope and they mailed me the cards, which I'll show at the bottom of this post.
Many of you design-savvy readers will know that emerald has been one of the key colours in decorating this year. (Elle Decor chose it as one of the Top 11 Trends of 2011.) And hasn't it just come out of the colour gates like Black Caviar at the Spring Racing Carnival? Green has not only shot to the front of the design stakes but shown its colours in a magnificent way.
I'm done in the kitchen for the day now. I'm sipping my second or third cup of tea as well as my water bottle with a couple of cucumber slices in it. I'm going to put in my last load of laundry, do a few minutes of yoga, and then have a bowl of soup. I think I might even brew a couple bags of chamomile tea, put it in a big bowl and enjoy a facial steam, perhaps followed by a nap.

One day, I was scrolling through my dashboard as I did every day, and I stumbled across a video reblogged by Andrew Hussie. I read his comment first, and apparently it was a great video: put together well, the message was good, et cetera. I then decided to watch it and looked at the length. Thirty minutes! I don’t have enough time to watch a thirty-minute video.
Not surprisingly the huge dependence on external flows in Egypt and Sudan has driven major supply-side developments, seeking to both capture and regulate the river’s flows. This has progressed throughout the twentieth century, and now constitutes the main system of regulating the river’s flows. They are, as well, largely constructed to suit a particular set of demands and legal and institutional structures established between Egypt and Sudan, in particular. The future challenge of ensuring that cooperation leads to development in the future may require changes in the way supply structures are used, as well as the inclusion of new structures in upstream countries.

I don't live with him anymore, so now I get the emailed version of these notes instead. I get them on my birthday and my anniversary, I get them when we haven't talked in a little while, I get them when he knows I have something big coming up. I get them when he's worried about something, and those are the ones we laugh about, like one time I emailed my mom's family's listserv to ask if the rosemary growing in my grandma's yard was the edible kind and my dad, who's never once responded to a single of those group emails and who I didn't even think read them ever, replied-all with: "Kelly: if you don't know, I think you need to assume IT IS THE POISONOUS KIND." I got an email when he heard the song we danced to at my wedding come on the radio--"Kelly: I heard 'Father and Daughter' last night. Wonderful song."

The Hobbit was mentioned as the number one “Blockbuster with Buzz” with a subheader, Peter Jackson‘s vision of The Hobbit is Clear.

When I asked Bob what teams he thought K and S (our clients) cheered for he shot me the strangest look, one that read, "Woman, what were you drinking?" I told him I was bothered and needed to know. He told me that he would take the teams away from me and that I could paint 15mm Germans. So, under the threat of having the teams taken away and the painting of WWII Germans, I made my own choices. This may seem rather harsh but I'm terribly obsessive compulsive and will dwell on the painting of a figure for hours - even days. As you may realize, being obsessive compulsive isn't a good or effective business practice. :-)

The moral to this story is that there is a CLEAR path to success. A path and system that the U.S. PIONEERED and rode to tremendous success for several decades! When we have gotten off that path, the 1970’s and the “oughts”, we have seen others take over and begin to dominate. And when we have watched others emulate that path, they too have had the same type of success that our sprinters once enjoyed.
“While President Obama is speaking tonight, oil will continue to leak from the well and extend its stranglehold on the lives and livelihoods of the people in the affected areas. Even now, nearly two months after disaster first struck, the federal response remains inadequate and disorganized. Americans are rightly angry about this failure of government, and they want to know that their president is focused squarely on stopping this leak, cleaning up this mess, and finding out what went wrong.

The comedy of errors last night was the Board conversation around financially supporting failing programs, I’m Ready, and programs that only exist on paper, All City High, while not providing financial support to programs that may be adopted in the future, Freedom School, that are proven to work. This conversation did not take place when the Board passed a budget that cut the ArtPeace Program which was evidenced to work and funded the I’m Ready Program with no evidence of success.
Ireland named the recital room of its national concert hall after that pianistic nonentity John Field. So far, they have not honoured Stanford at all. However, signs of life – a Stanford festival is coming up, with a significant concert from John Finucane's Hibernian Orchestra. John, who is a superb clarinetist, championed the Stanford concerto. Imagine his surprise when he proposed playing it with the national symphony orchestra, only to be told that it was five minutes too long! Clearly, the petty nationalists are still ensconced. More about the Hibernian Orchestra's concert here. And more about the festival at the nascent Stanford Society's website.

There again, perhaps it was actually just largely ignored by the radio DJs for other reasons, but I find that staggeringly hard to believe for a single so good. "Shake Hands With The Devil" is a piece of mod soul which seems from the very first play as if you've known it all your life - and whilst this may be because it falls back on a few cliched riffs here and there (the "Mustang Sally" descend, for example) it's also swings thrillingly. The organ screeches, the vocalists scream, whilst beneath a steady, nagging rhythm maintains law and order. It's the kind of raw and dancefloor friendly sound you'd expect from a single emerging from the USA at this time, but amazingly Patterson's People actually stemmed from the incredibly dull Aylesbury, whose only real claim to fame to this day is being Bill Drummond's retirement town.

TWENTY-FIVE years today and still loving every minute (almost) of our time. He is my best friend and my love. We have done so much and so much more to do. Great plans for this year and early next year. We are avid campers (RV'ers) and are now planning our "Bucket List" trip for next Winter to Louisiana and the South. Cannot wait. I need to plan everything out precisely as we will be leaving from up North in December to travel first to North Carolina to spend Christmas with the family and then to Florida to visit with friends and, drumroll please, then to Alabama and Louisiana along the Gulf of Mexico. The most challenging part is when we start back North in February. Finding campgrounds open in the Winter and praying for no snow is going to take a lot of planning.

Many religious bodies claim to be a continuation of the New Testament Church, but is there a church that literally traces its roots back to the original Churches founded by Christ in Jerusalem and by the Apostles in the cities of the New Testament? Are those same local Churches that were established by the Apostles still in existence, and if so, what kind of Christian Church are they and do they still verifiably and historically uphold the doctrines of early Christianity? You have heard of Protestantism (including so-called “non-denominational” churches), and you have heard of Roman Catholicism, but have you heard of the oldest and second largest form of Christianity on earth–the Orthodox Church?

There was a little black guy, and a yellow dog who had a terrible time. Left its mark on me, I can tell you.”
Shostakovich’s story is an interesting one, as he was continually vilified and attacked by Josef Stalin and his “apparatchiks” off and on throughout his career for the manner in which he wrote his music. Socialist composers were supposed to write music that was deemed to be universally acceptable. Soviet composers such as Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian were to write works for massed choirs, operas on revolutionary subjects with happy endings, instrumental pieces with an implicit socialist agenda (similar attitudes were held in Nazi Germany). Abstraction was discouraged, as was dissonance. Shostakovich’s Ninth Symphony in E Flat Major (Op. 70) was actually censured by the Soviet authorities for its “ideological weakness”, and eventually banned in 1948 (it was removed from the banned works list in 1955, following Stalin’s death).
In the memories you recall,
Jesus then asks to talk to Mary. Mary is still back at the house, and Martha goes to get her. Mary goes out to meet him, and the group of well-wishers who had come up from Jerusalem follow her, thinking that she’s going to visit Lazarus’ tomb. When Mary reaches Jesus, she falls at his feet and sobs that if only he had been there he could have saved him. Jesus is moved with compassion for her, and asks where they have entombed him. He weeps with sorrow, and the Jews say to each other how much Jesus must have loved Lazarus. Some of them wonder quietly that if Jesus could heal a blind man like he did, maybe he could have kept Lazarus from dying.

I would not want Lebron back if I was a fan or running the Cavaliers. Lebron will be 29 or 30 by the time he can opt out of his contract with the Miami Heat. This is by no means old in the NBA, but it's not the youngest either. Plus, the Cav's would have to basically throw the towel in on the next two and a half seasons. The NBA is a business and basically losing money for two and a half seasons it's really smart business, but they would probably lose money over the next two seasons regardless. So that argument is really mute. Basically, it comes down to the prince himself.

Some people are given every advantage, and they squander them. Others take the modest skills they have and with nothing more than perseverance and sweat, succeed with them. They might go on to buy a big, comfy house where the person that squandered their gifts or makes a series of bad choices drives a 20 year old Buick and rents an apartment with a roommate. Sometimes the person that did everything right, still ends up with the 20 year old Buick. Sometimes life just kicks you in the teeth and you lose what you have, despite your hard work. That, folks, is reality, which has nothing to do with fairness.

Being a bird-watcher, I immediately woke right up and looked closer. It was the image of a bird, perfectly outlined on the water. But where was the bird? I didn’t see one anywhere. I dug out the binoculars and scanned the area until finally I could make out a similar shape on the tree trunk right above the water. It had blended so well into the darks of the woods behind it, you could barely make it out. I never would have seen it if I hadn’t noticed its reflection in the pond.
After that I stopped watching for him. Occasionally I glanced out of the window and saw his blue bobble hat emerging around the corner, or disappearing into the distance, but I looked away, or rolled down the blinds.

Sometimes I am well surprised by the way things turn out. And whether you are religious or not, whether you believe in a God or not, life doesn't just stop in its tracks unless you die. There's always another door to open. And sometimes, when all doors seem to be shut and locked, it just might be a window that is opened.

The main highlight of the film is the ending. The best way to describe the ending is it is jaw dropping and quite surprising. It is definitely one of the best endings I've seen in a film. After I finished watching this film, I could not stop thinking about it which shows how powerful it is and how touched I was by it.

One of the pairings that I enjoyed the most was the Comtes de Champagne Rose Brut 2004. A pure and frank rose, it was a deeper rose colour then expected. being almost orangish-red but having very heady aromas and a complex, intense palate. I enjoyed it on it’s own but served with a rose jelly was a delight, the jelly not so sweet that it overpowered the champagne. The red fruit character of the champagne exploded and really lingered. Although it was paired with dessert, I think it would have paired well with the biryani we had beforehand.
Later I swapped out these boots for bowling shoes. I think bowling shoes are super cute. Like, I want a pair. But I would never wear them anywhere but bowling. So then I always talk myself out of walking out with them.

I'm actually making two books to install into this assemblage. The first one is double bound, wrapped in soft leather. I wanted it to look old, since the theme for this piece is beginnings and endings. Here is a shot of the book opened up:
One of the earliest burlesque artistes who performed in the 1820’s (and whose legs when revealed were said to inspire many gentlemen to write poetry, and others to create pottery figurines that proved extremely popular) was the famed Eliza Vestris, originally an opera singer who progressed to dressing up as a man to send up classical arias.
Basically the 4 women, 1 in her 80′s, 1 in her 50′s and 2 in their late teens, where raped 1 by 1 by this dismembered penis until the two hands appeared and set fire to them. As they were already hysterical: they screamed horridly as they burnt, hair first.
Okay, Okay. I know that I had originally said that Whispering Evil would be available in June, but you know me. I couldn’t let it go until I knew it was right. Final proofing is going on now and the book should be available mid July.

I think the best teachers out there can find the most important topics that are either continued on later in mathematics or are most pertinent to that specific class and teach those units/areas for relational understanding, this was the students will be exactly where they need to be later on in their math career. And as for the other units that don’t take such an important role in the curriculum I think the teacher just needs to cut their losses and teach it instrumentally so they can better cover the more important material. That is why I think teaching both is important, but teaching all relational understanding is ideal.
Everyone was well enough Thursday for the pool party and off we went. Bring on the summer! Let the good times roll and all that fun stuff! Until, at 2 AM Friday morning Zack began the stomach virus that proceeded to take us down, one by one, all the way until Monday. Thankfully, that is over. The kids bounced back faster than I did... and I won't linger on that topic.
So you have to keep coming back!

I am sort of over it, you have disappeared over the last month. Was it something we did? No, its that you know things are sort of crappy for us right now. We really appreciate it. Really. We mean it. It is worth noting, you have been through some crap, and we stuck around. Now, when things suck for us you bail.

Jihad is regarded as the best thing, one can offer voluntarily. It is superior to nonobligatory prayers, fasting, Zakat, Umra and Hajj as mentioned in the Qur’an and the Ahadith of the Prophet(pbuh). The benefits of Jihad are of great extent and large in scope, while its effects are far-reaching and wide-spreading as regards Islam and the Muslims. For an individualMuslim, Jihad includes all acts of worship and all aspects of belief- thus bringing him greatest reward and vast blessings; and for the Muslim nation, Jihad provides all kinds of successes in respect of prosperity and dignity, victory and glory-thus bringing magnificence and splendour.
All in all its okay, not great just okay and drinkable.

Being a shameless lover of both movies and clothes, it's not really that surprising that I am a complete nut for costume design, be it sumptuous or slick. And the work of the late Eiko Ishioka, one of the most brilliant and original visionaries in the field, has been my favourite thing about the films she did costumes for for over a decade now - even when they were otherwise rubbish, the chance to see her clothes up close on a 70mm theatrical screen alone made it worth the price of the ticket. To those who are unfamiliar with her, here are some samples of her designs in film:

Naturally, she voted against the original legislation to cut the interest rate in half, slamming it as “big-government takeover.” The conservative intelligentsia has been opposed to government loan programs for years, preferring to leave the entire enterprise to the private market. The Wall Street Journal editorial page regularly blames tuition assistance for driving up the cost of college – which it possibly does, though the state-level evisceration of public support for universities really hasn’t helped the matter either. At the core of the argument, however, is the standard Republican disdain for anyone they perceive as being “on the dole.” National Review writer Victor Davis Hanson actually has the audacity to ask, “If our students are burdened with oppressive loans, why do so many university rec centers look like five-star spas? Student cell phones and cars are indistinguishable from those of the faculty.” Need I point out that the wealth of the institution, especially institutions like Harvard with billion-dollar endowments, is hardly connected to the wealth of the students? Then there are conservatives who praise the decline of public support for higher ed:

Japan's most well-known musical export in many a circle, and a helluva pianist to boot. Sαkαmoτo-san has had his hands in pretty much every genre known to man since his beginnings as a fiery young keyboardist behind electro-New Wave pioneers Yellow Magic Orchestra, and his aforementioned solo career is a rather formidable beast to tackle for those unprepared for the sheer amount of quality that is apparent from his decades of output.
You see, my Dad ruled our household with certain moral convictions. But this stranger never felt an obligation to honour them. Profanity, for example, was not allowed in our house - not from us, from our friends, or from adults. Yet, our longtime visitor, however, used occasional four letter words that burned my ears and made Dad squirm. To my knowledge the stranger was never confronted.

However, this isn’t The Rock’s first time being promoted in this type of match.

I have had the light in there changed once before. I can't even remember what came with the house, so I am sure it was ugly. The newer new fixture isn't really what I would call pretty either but I love this farm style galvanized one! LOVE IT! And already bought and paid for makes it even sweeter. Why didn't I think of this before? duh!
You may be wondering why I bothered listing the 'main ingredients' if most of them have scientific names which really don't make sense to the average person. One reason is, they were conveniently listed on the back *LOL*, and another reason is because I think it's important to know what we're putting on our skin. I'm not the biggest chemistry savvy person, but I did study it in high school and in my first year at university. Even though these ingredients are a great big mouthful, I think it's actually quite fun & eye-opening to learn more about what goes into the products I'm using.
Yes, with a passion, I wish I’d known all this a long time before. I wish both Alex and I had. But the past is the past. What is important now is that by understanding who I truly am, understanding my values and having improved the rules I apply to those values I hope and trust I’m in a position to give myself a far better Survival Strategy.

At the beginning of the game, everyone is handed one Loyalty Card (depending on what character you pick; some characters, like Gaius, get two the first time around because they’re super sketchy). You get dealt another one in the middle of the game (which allows for sleeper agents). Without letting anyone see your Loyalty Card, you look at it.

I think getting adults and teenagers together to read and talk about books is a wonderful idea. Which is why it's rather sad and frustrating to hear that when Ruth had asked all the adult book groups which one would like to do this project, the others weren't interested. Seems they thought teenage books were beneath them. I wonder if they've read any. The number of times I have told someone I'm a teenage author and they say, "Oh, what, like Jacqueline Wilson / the Harry Potter books." No, no, no. Open your eyes to what's out there, people. There's a world of teenage books and some of them will make you think more deeply and more interestingly than many adult ones.
I've noticed some authors going in together on a signing or a book talk. I haven't done this myself, but I attended a museum event where 40 people came to meet 4 authors. What's key is finding authors who write in genres similar to yours. With some genres this is easy; with others, well, be picky.

Dominique Strauss Kahn, current head of the International Monetary Fund and long thought to be the Socialist Party's best bet to unseat President Sarkozy in next year's election, appears to have self destructed over the weekend. He was hauled off an Air France flight just before it left New York and charged with sexual assault by a maid at the hotel where he'd been staying. Whether DSK is actually guilty or not, my guess is that his chances for becoming France's next president are now next to nil. And for President Sarkozy, whose public opinion numbers are already in the toilet, this probably couldn't be better news. And the timing is exquisite. La Conquête, a controversial and apparently highly unflattering film about Sarkozy's bid for the presidency in 2007, is set to release Wednesday and all the world is abuzz.

Now we all know that when you see the word scone you pronounce it “scone”. To do otherwise would indicate that you came from the wrong part of the country or wrong social class. And we couldn’t have that now could we? Merely saying “scone” when these people from other classes or other parts of the country say “scone” helps us assert ourselves and confirm our essential right-ness in the world. However, sometimes we are exposed, through the media, to those that are clearly wrong-headed.

* What is a church plant, you ask? It's a church family who sets up and tears down chairs, tables, speakers, sound boards, linens, flowers, art, nursery, kids' classrooms, and more on a weekly basis. This type of church is usually called a church plant... a small, start up church that was "planted" from a larger established church. A church plant is most likely only a few years old and doesn't own their space where they usually worship. I am a part of such a church and really love it. I think it's great to not have the burden of building/buying and maintaining a building that might be used only once a week. I also enjoy the set up every week... there is something special about jumping in and doing a job with a few other people who serve the church by setting up sound equipment, drums and other instruments, and, in my case, decor.

In the endure date of anniversary world, you’ll go up adjoin Donkey Kong in a bang-up battle. These are a little altered than in the endure game, as technically all you’re accomplishing is ablution Minis out of a cannon at an apparent DK. However, there is a bit added to it than that. For one, the bulk of Minis you accomplishment throughout a world’s stages ends up accepting the bulk of Minis you can use to shoot at DK. Hitting DK with a advance doesn’t abatement your ammo count, but accepting hit with one of the assorted altar DK throws down at you, or battlefront into a acicular barrier, accidental amphibian enemy, or added such obstacle will bulk you one Mini. You accept to continuously amphitheater your cannon about to abstain objects, as able-bodied as acclimatize based on beyond DK appears on the top screen, as he’s in actuality alive and cast to move around. The endure bang-up action in the bold changes the bold up a bit. We won’t blemish it for you, but we will say it’s abundant added like the archetypal Donkey Kong that a lot of accept arise to apperceive and adulation over the years.
“Well, of course, it would be foolish for her to go,” the Gypsy King continued. “Her father would be so angry if he found out, and the man might be dangerous. But, there was something about him that she just couldn’t deny. So, when the moon was bright in the sky, and her parents were sleeping soundly, she slipped out of the house and met her Gypsy at the well. And that was the last anyone ever heard from her.”
First off -- apologies for the lack of updates and general slowness; I've spent all this past week attending and in transit to conferences with my day beginning promptly at 5am and ending at 9pm, which is an exercise that requires Zen-like endurance (such is the scholarly life!). All yesterday was spent luxuriously doing absolutely nothing of importance or note, and today, with the exception of more reading, catching up, and the Ravens/Patriots and Niners/Giants game (which is certainly something of importance and note) will be more or less the same.
The Abominable Dr. Phibes should solidly be considered a Vincent Price vehicle. He steal every scene in his own indomitable way. The other characters, particularly the doomed medical staff, are caricatures of real people with their evil and/or perversity serving as their only character aspect. That is not to say the film is a cheapo, one trick pony. Price alone is well worth the price (pardon the pun) of admission. Fans of gory, modern days revenge trash like Saw need to watch The Abominable Dr. Phibes to see how its done right..
Hmm, he looks familiar, but I can't place his face to a name.

November 4th I called my buyer to see when the cheque would be ready. He said the man at the bank handling all this was off sick, but he'd find out if someone else could expedite things. November 6th my buyer (wife) called to tell me that their bank would not do the loan without using a loan arranger and that this triggered close to $23,000 in GST tax and that they didn't have that $23K because her property management company was purchasing two apartment buildings and they needed $450K by November 15th. She then asked me if I'd drop my price by $20K and to think about it and let her know.

A few hours later, President Obama addressed the nation and the world in a more formal manner. “I will not keep Americans in harm’s way a single day longer than is absolutely required for our national security,” Mr Obama said. “But we must finish the job we started in Afghanistan, and end this war responsibly.” This is nearly identical language to that he used when he announced he would withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq. About 23,000 of the 88,000 US troops currently in the country are expected to leave Afghanistan by the summer, with all US and Nato combat troops out by the end of 2014.

It feels like I've been here for ages. The Hague's not the center of the world, but I've fallen in love, he's proposed, and I guess that changes everything :D It's kinda weird I know, ME with someone, but he's hard to beat in all departments; and more than anything I'm thoroughly surprised at how things have panned out. I mean, he's the funny, intelligent, somewhat geeky, athletic, non-socially retarded type of guy I've been looking for. Those, in that particular combination, I've realized, are rare. He's also stylish, very neat, loves cooking and can probably kill someone with his bare hands if they'd tried to hurt me. (Well, he survived the war. And he was almost stabbed by some thug, once, which he then secured to a lamp-post. With a pair of hand-cuffs. The sort you get in the sex shop. The guy started crying and had to wait for the police to come free him.)

Yet people are understandably keen to know what the precise relationship was between Breitvik and the EDL. However, many people seem to be forgetting something. Breitvik was an unknown until three days ago. He was a nobody. He may not have even had a police or a criminal record. So how could the EDL have known the secret beliefs and intentions of this man? He may well have visited England - and even protested with the EDL - and never said a single word about direct action and indeed about the political use of terrorism.

This is a sea change, no matter what USC fans might try to say. For seven years Pete Carroll fought the very waters of creation and succeeded despite terrible overwrought metaphors and the 85 scholarship limit. There’s no way Lane Kiffin just forges on and continues what happened from 2002-2008. There’s no way in the same vein there was no way a washed up ex-NFL coach could bring Southern Cal glory once more, except now it’s actually true. I’ll tell you what’s gonna happen: good, sometimes great seasons, peppered with occasional mediocrity. It’s the dim, terrifying shape beneath the waters, coursing through the oceans on kraken limbs: normality. Time to come down back to earth. Bless Lane and his family and his father and everyone who’s come to USC to declare their own destinies, because I have to admire such tenacity in the face of such obvious inexorablility.

In the Greek language the word for ‘man’ is άνθρωπος, which is the product of the combination of the words ‘άνω’ (up) and ‘θρώσκω’ (to look). This means that the name man gave to himself was ‘one who looks up’, with the latter referring to god (who was expected to live in the skies…), but as well as to anything divine and superior in the broader sense. Man is ingrained with the ambition and desire to understand what is around him and ‘above’ him, this magic power that, at least the way we perceive the Universe, separates us from the other forms of life. Then, through the years we have learned to use the expressions ‘high technology’, ‘haute couture’, ‘high standards’ for the best and the ‘sky’ was always linked to excellence…

Part of this – as writers recognise – is because any word comes with a load of secondary attachments. So, apple-purée is more than mashed apple: it is warm and thick and sweet and soft, rolling on the tongue, slipping down the throat. It is not dry or dusty or icy or blue or spiky. In Mondays are Red, the girl with the cinnamon skin has “hair as long as the sound of honey”. Well, honey may not have a sound but it is thick and moves slowly and if dropped from a spoon is long and straight and golden and full of goodness. And that is what her hair was like. It’s not beyond the bounds of imagination to feel that it could have a sound, too. Violin sounds are lemon-sharp and lemon-yellow and lime-tangy, thin, sharp, bitter, stringy. All these words bring with them more than a single literal meaning.
When Lori and Roman worked with his crutches it was always her doing most of the work. She would stand behind Rome and hover atop him. She would place her hands on top of his and most of the time she would support his body with her knees.

Soul Clothes by Regina Jemison is not a particularly long book - it is comprised of 44 pages and 12 poems, with a mostly African-American and law based leaning. However, I found that it really and truly packed a punch that I, at least, associate with a much larger, more dense book. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from it - I'm not normally someone that reads a lot of poetry, with the exception of a former co-worker's published works, so I was really hesitant at first. However, I was pleasantly surprised.
Rum Central also had a cocktail menu, with a full page dedicated to mojitos. My feelings about mojitos generally parallels my feeling about martinis: there is one, and only one, and anyone who asks “what’s your favorite kind of mojito?” needs a corrective lecture. (Although I have been known to make an exception for the ginger mojito, topped with ginger ale rather than soda water.) Rum Central offered a goodly list of mojitos, including a Mojito del Ché, topped off with beer. I do not know of any documentation linking such a drink with Ché, nor could I think of any reason to try one.

I don’t know how long I plan to be here (maybe I’ll never leave, maybe I’ll be gone in a month) but hopefully at the end of it I’ll have a book, an acceptance letter from a graduate school (one of the ones I’ve already applied to), or just a better idea what comes next. Although, as of right now, I’m perfectly content enjoying and doing nothing. I have no real plans, just ideas, and, believe me, it feels pretty good.
So for Welles to choose as the main character of his film a thoroughly corrupt cop, and one utterly distasteful to watch, was itself a powerful stroke of iconoclasm during a ‘golden age’ of conformity. From an artistic point of view, as any writer will tell you, the choice of an antihero as the centerpiece of a story is not only risky but extremely difficult to pull off. Audiences have a natural dislike of an antihero so it takes great skill to keep them from deserting the book or film. A successful use of antihero occurs in Stephen R. Donaldson’s fantasy series, The Thomas Covenant Chronicles. The eponymous character starts the multiple-book series by committing a shocking rape yet somehow we never abandon him. Now that’s skill.
Busses were messed up on the way home, so Cici and I drove down and picked them up and ran a few errands on the way home. They kept calling it the "Mexican Party" rather than Cinco de Mayo, but that's true too! Maybe next year we'll all go!

It appears his complete focus is on his re-election campaign. We understand the importance of this to Mr. Obama because the winning Presidency for a second term would allow him to continue his lavish lifestyle which is funded by the taxpayers of the United States.
How in the world did he get her?
The downside to The Bleeding House comes in the pacing: it is a slow burn. There’s nothing wrong with a slow burn if there is something awaiting the audience at the end. Given the fact that this isn’t a film about “what happens”, but rather “how it happens”, this works against the slow burn concept. One of the biggest questions of the film is answered halfway through, and though we learn more about it as the movie progresses, this question could have been left unanswered until the third act, and it may have helped the film move a little quicker. Such a short film (it has an 87-minute running time) shouldn’t feel so slowly paced.
Already sounds like a lot less doesn’t it?

Anna Trebunskaya and her husband Jonathan Roberts danced a tribute to their friend Julia Ivleva, a professional dancer who has stage 4 lung cancer. Anna said since she and Jonathan are married and have been dancing so long that they understood how it must be for Julia and her husband Igor, her dance partner. They waltzed such a moving, emotional tribute to Julia. She's too frail to dance but travels with her husband and is staying positive. I love watching Anna and Jonathan dance together and am so glad they did this. It was mesmerizing. Oh my, Julia and Igor are in the audience. More tears.

I thought I'd pop in and share a card I made using the Walzingmouse sketch challenge as my starting point. I dug out some older papers that I got a while ago because they had gorgeous butterflies on them (what more of a reason to you need lol??) but I hadn't used much of it because I didn't want hide the butterflies by putting other stuff on top -- so I set to work cutting them out!
“I wasn’t really following them. I didn’t have to go out of my way or anything to see what they were doing because it was right in front of the bus terminal. Anybody could have seen them. I’m following them now because the Cadillac has been following the bus since Philadelphia, so I figure they must be around somewhere with the woman they kidnapped.”

In terms of immediate steps, Greece is not without a defense against the downward spiral of austerity. Comparisons are being made with Argentina, which defaulted on its debt that was too big to pay and allowed the foreign-exchange market to drastically devalue its currency. There is much talk of Greece defaulting, but that is only one half of the “Argentina” option — Greece simultaneously would have to drop the euro and re-adopt its old currency, the drachma.

Where his body was slowly beginning to turn against him, his mind was still completely his own. His forgetfulness was limited to the first few seconds when he woke up. Laying eyes wide open but seeing nothing he would wait. Expecting. Shallow breaths allowing every muscle to ready for action. Adrenaline moving within him in a dance he didn’t want to do. Then slowly, the room would surround him. His room. His ceiling. His home. His breathing would return to normal. The adrenaline would leave him in the only way it could, a clammy sweat that made him shiver. Even after forty years, a soldier can leave the war but the war will never leave a soldier. He hated those moments the most. This was his life now. HIS. And those old memories had no right to show up. They didn’t belong in his bedroom with the pictures, the feather pillows and the flannel sheets. He had never been able to figure out how to pack them away, though. Over time, he simply learned to accept them much like he accepted the ache in his knees and the stoop in his shoulders. They were another daily hindrance that he could do nothing to remedy.
The latter, it would seem: a trial, proclaimed Ashley, “has a chance of reassuring many in the community who indicated by their votes Tuesday that, with or without doubts about how the case has proceeded, they want to see this resolved in a rational fashion.”

Images are the symbols of a beautiful moment spent with dear ones. That is why everybody keeps the pictures of the moment they spend with them. But to do this, a good quality camera becomes essential. If one really has to buy a camera, then it is better to buy Nikon Coolpix L100 camera to get high resolution images.

“Dick Cavett and Johnny Carson don’t know what to say to anybody black, unless there’s some black bitch on the show and she’s all over them,” he told me while conducting a guided tour of his unconventional but comfortable Upper West Side residence. “It’s so awkward for them, because they know all the white facial expressions, but they’re not hip to black expressions, and God knows they’re not hip to Chinese expressions. You see, they’ve seen all the white expressions, like fear, sex, revenge. White actors imitate other white actors when they express emotions, but they don’t know how black people react. Dick Cavett is quiet now when a black cat is talking to him, because he doesn’t know if the expression on his face means ‘I’m going to kick your ass,’ or if ‘right on’ means he’s going to throw a right hand punch. So,” he continued, pointing out the oddly shaped, multi-level blue tile bathtub, “rather than embarrass them and myself, I just play on those shows and tell them not to say anything to me—I have nothing to say to them anyway.”

So last Tuesday when I was offered my own one man exhibition to be hung today - less than one week later - I obviously jumped at the chance, after all I am nothing if not an opportunist. The club room of Smethwick Photographic Society plays host to various prestigious exhibitions including all of the major Royal Photographic Society exhibitions, the London Salon of photography and the Smethwick International exhibition. Well this evening there are 113 of my prints hanging there, including 50 new images worked on, printed and mounted over the Easter weekend. I hadn't planned to do much over the bank holiday anyway!
But the most bizarre, albeit interesting, proposal involved a Ponte Vecchio-like City Hall built on piers across Town Lake just west of the First Street Bridge. Ranging from one to two stories, and consisting of 280,000 square feet, this building terminated on the south in an amphitheater on Auditorium Shores, and on the north with an apartment/retail/parking garage complex bordered by First, Second, San Antonio, and Guadalupe.

The idea of “transmutation,” the raising of the kundalini to sublimate sexual desire was a nice sounding principle that meant nothing to me in practice. You see, I started from the premise that sex was something that got in the way of spirituality and that it was a “waste” of vital essence, that it was something to “transmute,” that higher spiritual perceptions occur only when the sex desire is let go of. This starting point would hardly allow for the transmutation of sex desire, as I was not able to transmute that which I did not wish to fully look at or embrace within myself.
Tapena Wines was started five years ago, with the intent of creating fruit forward, food-friendly Spanish wines. The term "tapeña" is a mix of "tapas" (small dishes of food) with "peña" (slang for a group of close friends). They make four wines, a Verdejo, Rosé, Tempranillo and Garnacha, and they are Vinos de la Tierra de Castilla, which means production is more flexible than under the regulations of the Denominacion de Origen system. The label is designed to look like a chalkboard, the type you would see at a Spanish restaurant presenting the daily specials, and the fork represents that they are food friendly.

Morally correct, ethically wrong. A week’s suspension and formal apology maybe would have been better? Though CEOs are overpaid and deserve no sympathy for their sequestration of wealth, this treatment of Mr.Thompson is extreme and should result in a lawsuit by Alasdair Thompson who should use the analogy of ‘an eye for an eye’ or ‘a tooth for a tooth’.

Before the match we get highlights from Big Show winning the IC title at Wrestlemania, making him one of five men to have held all the active titles in the WWE. The IC, Tag, US, WWE and World Titles, which is pretty impressive actually, Shawn Michaels and Owen Hart mentioned as being in that group? What is Cole smoking anyways, neither Owen or Shawn ever held the US title? Show starts out quick and tosses Cody around the ring sending Cody to the outside. Show sets up the table and goes to toss Cody into it, but Cody fights free so Show tosses Cody over the guardrail. In the ring and Show sets the table in the corner, then sends Cody into it but Cody jumps off it to hit the Disaster Kick. Show comes back with ease and tosses Cody outside to continue hammering him before tossing Cody back in. Cody bails out the other side and Show goes after him. Show tosses Cody back in the ring again but gets dropkicked off the apron, Show steps back on the table, which gives way. Cody win the match and regains the title, and Show looks furious. 2/10 basically a squash until the screwjob ending, although it was an original ending. After the match Cody celebrates regaining his title and Show spears him. Show sets up a table and chokeslams Cody through the table, and the crowd boos Show.Show looks down at the table he stepped on and grabs Cody again, then press-slams Cody over the top rope to the floor through another table.

So this little cutie pie is my baby girl. Who Just turned 13 last week. This shot was done for her dance studio. I LOVE this pic.

I think it went so well with the picture and another that I will share soon.
Butternut soup, fillet steak (Innkeeper), stuffed chicken breast (Anna) and malva pudding. Really good. Except for the malva which was stodgy.

I must first say that since last Saturday I have had three early morning mmo sessions of about 90 minutes each.

Peace and love are our two daughters watching Christmas carolers last night, in the park of our town, surrounded by other families, cold faces and hands, coffee, hot chocolate, lights, lights, and music. Peace and love are the two, three, no four times we ran into people we know and care for who care for us, and greeted with smiles and hugs. Peace and love are Ever's face watching Santa for the very first time. Peace and love is our family all together Friday night, stuffed onto couches, watching a movie and laughing and then crying and then laughing because we are all crying. Peace and love is the tickle war between our kids that ended with a chipped tooth. Peace and love is your body on mine our couch late last night, next to the Christmas tree, after rum and eggnog, while our girls slept. It is Lola's faith You and Daddy always make everything good, it Dakota's choice to be with us, at 17, on a Saturday night instead of with friends, it is our family bed, it is our inside jokes about poop ( Lola calls them butt guts! ) and the tender words we all write on cards for birthdays. It is our family chore day, it is our constant refrain to be kind, to be honest even- especially- when it's hard, to think of the group and not just yourself, to give, to pray even if maybe faith is short or prayers feel silly, it is the small- Lola's love notes for us- and the large- Ian's special birthday present to you. It is you working Saturdays for extra money, and me giving up new clothes so Lola can have a Girl Scout trip. Nothing can ever, ever duplicate, replicate or equal the importance and meaning of our family and how we choose to live our life. We can go anywhere, we can live anywhere, but we cannot love like this with anyone. It is us, it is you, and your strength over the years, your steady work, work- you work harder than any man I've ever known- your dedication to us, you pushing yourself beyond personal limitations and making new of yourself.
