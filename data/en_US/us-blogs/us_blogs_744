“This is both racist and a load of crap…” it opened. After the initial shock at the critique we sparked, it was a quick decision for us to approve the comment for publication completely unfiltered and just as it had been submitted. The comment’s tone was actually hard to read. It seemed to be animated, offended, joking and chiding all at the same time, and ultimately closed with a rhetorical question and a smiley-face. Maybe it was a good-natured challenge. Anyways, we don’t take it personally. We can take the critique.
At no point did the novel grip me and make me want to stay up and read it.

This blog is my attempt to explain why I feel American women are inferior to foreign women (non-American women), and why American men should boycott American women, and date/marry only foreign (non-American) women.
I do want to say that there’s a fine line between constant marketing and just getting to know people. I hate saying, “Buy my book!” Instead I prefer to chat with people and connect with them on a personal level. It makes the whole process much more interesting than being an author on a pedestal.

Now I must admit Gilt does pay a certain level of attention to what gay men are actually wearing (at least in New York). Y3 is a current fixture on high top stomping, loose short, tank topped gays of New York these days and it's also one of Gilt's most common brands. Without having actual sales information in front of me and from a purely customer perspective the brand sells immensely well for Gilt.
It is a strand of this belief that sees a narrow, seemingly somewhat arbitrary, band of managers afforded unanimous acclaim, whilst question marks attach themselves to all others. Inevitably, the list is headed by Sir Alex Ferguson. The Scot’s stubborn longevity and success deservedly marks him out, though quite what appeals so actively about Martin O’Neill and Harry Redknapp is baffling. The media’s mass man-crush on José Mourinho is maybe more understandable, as the Portuguese’s blustering bravado and Machiavellian machismo played to a gallery of limp, middle-aged nerds grateful to be granted the company of the kind of character who would under usual circumstances contemptuously shun them.

The President and his advisors know this-- seemingly the Republicans don't--otherwise the GOP would be more proactive in supporting some form of comprehensive immigration reform. The Tea Party members were elected to stand up for their constituents on fiscal issues, and are certainly doing that, no matter what the political consequences are in next year's congressional election.
I do wonder, though, at the audacity of Amber Valley Labour Party, who are making such allegations of impropriety at a time when once again Nottingham is awash with discussion about allegations that Nottingham City Council spent £20,000 on a campaign that the district auditor said bore a striking similarity to an election campaign the Labour Party was running at the same time in the city. The auditor described the 'Proud of Nottingham' campaign as being of questionable lawfulness.
Oh, I was also given a slip – a notice and reminder of what I’m expected to do at 8.30AM on Wednesday 11 February 2009. It was still just past 10AM. There was something good about that drama – the state of lethargy I had been in since a few weeks ago (mostly due to work-related stress) was gone! Instead, I was quite pumped up from all the excitement… plus the good feelings of feeling appreciative of the concerns and efforts of friends – people who didn’t abandon me in that time of need.

It could be argued that the adults in this novel were poorly presented, what with the secrets that they hid from Tanya, but I suspect they shall come into their own in future books - particularly Warwick. It would be incredibly nit-picky to suggest that this spoilt the story at all for me.
Guess what folks, Carey Price has a concussion. If the Habs were battling for a playoff spot, this would be big news. As for now, talk to me if the concussion symptoms are still hanging around in September.

As a freshman in college, I became aware of the refugee population in Houston and began volunteering with PAIR. Four years later, I am proud to say that I am still a volunteer with this incredible grassroots organization that works tirelessly to meet the needs of Houston’s refugee youth. One of most remarkable aspects of this journey has been a deepening realization of how college students are empowered to help refugee youth; not by buying things or going on service trips, but through weekly sessions that take place in our own community. As students, the most valuable resources we can offer to help others are time and energy, both of which are what make PAIR run on a weekly basis. We are able to offer the best of what we have and invest it into a cause that is close to home.
We'll just start off my parents' visit with this little window into their vacation. LOL
There is nothing wrong with your Rhythm if you are happy with where you are and what you are achieving. There is nothing wrong with your rhythm if you don't want something different for your life. What if you do though, want something different for your life? You need to break your stride! You need to stop the left foot right foot chant in your head that is moving you toward the mall exit and turn left! You need to throw a orange pillow into the white pillow, blue pillow pattern. That monster house with the purple door stuck between to cookie cutter homes on any street in suburbia catches the attention of everyone – I promise!

A public letter from English and African-American Studies professor Houston Baker opened the floodgates. Lamenting the “college and university blind-eying of male athletes, veritably given license to rape, maraud, deploy hate speech, and feel proud of themselves in the bargain,” Baker denounced the “abhorrent sexual assault, verbal racial violence, and drunken white male privilege loosed amongst us.” To act against “violent, white, male, athletic privilege,” he urged the “immediate dismissals” of “the team itself and its players.”
I'm sure that RT FaRTy, would make a brilliant Assembly Leader, if elected! But before being described as Leader of the Welsh Assembly – shouldn't he overcome the teeny, weeny, bitty hurdle of being elected to the post?
I looked down at my little guy with his crazy morning afro, backwards undies, banana fear in his eyes and thought, thank you Lord for sending me such a wacky, complicated child. My life would be far less colorful. Amen.
I confess that the only inspiration behind wanting to watch today’s movie was to shit on it. I feel like it’s been a while since I really got to ridicule a movie for how bad it was since it seems people have actually been requesting movies that they genuinely want my opinion on, as opposed to movies they just want to punish me with. But I need to watch a piece of shit every now and then. It builds up my immune system. And it’s a lot funnier when I hate the movie and can give you numerous reasons why. When I saw today’s movie was available in a RedBox, I reserved the shit right out of it. So let’s get into a movie that you all may have seen commercials for, but were all probably well aware of the fact that you didn’t want to see it. This movie is Hop, written by Ken Daurio, Brian Lynch, and Cinco Paul, directed by Tim Hill, and starring James Marsden, the voice and physical form of Russell Brand, Kaley Cuoco, the voice of Hugh Laurie, the voice of Hank Azaria, Gary Cole, Elizabeth Perkins, David Hasselhoff, and Chelsea Handler.

Sam reassured me that parents, guardians and relatives will be updated by the days’ activities through facebook . As volunteers they were advised to refrain from using their phones except during emergencies because they need to be focused on the kids that they will be taking care of. They have schedules that needed to be followed. Activities like swimming, arts and crafts, visiting the locality and other tourist attractions, going to church and a Special Olympics will definitely fill those ten days. She added that by the time she and Red returns home, he would have learned how to swim and improved on his speech.
Moreover, we have chosen to dramatically insert the state — with all its inadequacies and prejudices — into the world of private morality. In doing so, the boundary between the public and personal has been erased forever.

Now, you might think that its status as largely blah show would make me not want to watch it, let alone write about it, but as bad as the show might be at times, the central characters of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy really do make each episode worth watching once. (Well, maybe not THE SQUIRE OF GOTHOS, but everything else.) And once you accept that the show is going to artificially hamstring its characters and inflate the conflict through silly plot contrivances, it can actually be an enjoyable show that’s occasionally really, really good.

Apparently, I need to start paying attention to Very Good Advice from Gollum:
Keep them in an airtight container in the fridge all the time after fermented.
The Thais usually put the legs of food cabinets in cups of water, to prevent the ants from spoiling the food. This is an old tradition, and can also be applied when protecting book cabinets from termites. How do you avoid the wood from getting wet? Use two cups! One larger with water, and one inner dry cup for the leg. It is also important not to leave food on floors or tables. The presence of ants may explain the Thai’s love for cleaning, because any food crumbs will attract ants.
Part memoir, part history of ideas of the afterlife, and part road map to what might truly await each of us when we leave our bodies behind, The Modern Book of the Dead is a wise and courageous book that approaches the question of the afterlife in a refreshingly intimate manner. Weaving together philosophy, science, stories of near-death experiences, and theology, the author comes to one amazing and uplifting truth: that somehow, human consciousness lives on after death. Both inspiring and intimate, this is a modern meditation that allows the reader to think about death in an all-new way.

Senate Republican Leader Dean Skelos is cutting a new district for the GOP centered in Boro Park. The GOP sided with the Orthodox Jews over the Russians for three reasons. The Russians were politically out maneuvered, two, the Russians have not been given credit for the victory's they have won and the GOP leadership is clueless, stupid or made some kind of double deal with Vito Lopez to save Marty Golden's seat. Both of the elected officials from Boro Park made it clear to Skelos they did not want a state senate district centered in their community. Greenfield who owes his victory to the Russians lead by Davidzon and Hikind who works closely with Skelos and has supported a number of GOP candidates including Congressman Turner.
ADDI is one of the rare opcodes that can operate directly on a memory address, without having to load the value into a register first. This is a good thing, since the work done inside the interrupts must be absolutely minimal, we have very few clock cycles available before the proton beam has finished resetting. Next, interrupts must be enabled via the status register. In my original init code, I initialised this register to 0×2700 as per some sample code, with little thought as to what it was up to. I’ve found some information about its bits:

Alinsky is a maddening figure to assess, even from this distance. He was charismatic, caring and selfless, but he could be crude, vulgar, disruptive and self-centered--often at the same time. His passion inspired downtrodden people, from Chicago stockyard workers to California migrant laborers, to organize and stand up for themselves.
The crew at Beer Deluxe, ably led by Barney Matthews and managed adeptly by Siobhan and Sam out front and Quentin in the kitchen have the dedication to their jobs to ensure that these nights are run smoothly and with an effortless efficiency. The food and beer matches are more than mere good luck and with details like Evan’s Goat Art in Hops and Malt (see picture) it would seem that early bookings for coming Beer Dinners would be advisable.
Disc and pad material varies according to their manufacturer (Carbon Industrie & Hitco). It is also tuned for each race and even for each driver. Additionally cooling patterns will vary from track to track, For Force India in Melbourne we can see the high density drillings, with three small drillings across the disc. With Melbourne being heavy on braking the pads are also drilled in attempt to keep the brake system cool. Brakes and pads wear at an equal rate, so the few millimeters gap in between disc surface and drillings is all the wear these parts will see, before catastrophic failure. As wear increases with temperature there are sensors measuring the disc surface temperature and also wear sensors for both the inner and outer pads.
- The Golden Age of Television brought us gems like Alfred Hitchcock Presents (later the Alfred Hitchcock Hour), (George McFly favorite) Science Fiction Theatre, The Outer Limits, and of course, The Twilight Zone. Most of these shows ran hundreds of episodes, with a few familiar faces and plotlines that have been recycled and parodied to this day (check for new Twilight Zone feature). These shows set the standard by which all Anthology Series will be judged.

My absolutely favorite flowering plant is the wisteria. I love, love, love the sweet scent, and the trailing, climbing behavior allows those beautiful lavender clusters to hang freely and drift in the breeze, sending the rich, luscious aroma throughout the yard. My wisteria is still young, and only about three feet in height, but this year it is covered with buds, so I can’t wait to see it in another month. It has a very unique home near my metal car shed. (I live in the country, on a farm, so my gardens are a little odd or quirky.) I know that wisteria develop extremely thick (trunks, in lieu of a better word), so I had to find something sturdy for it to climb on. So I dragged up an eight foot long, heavy metal ramp that we use to load the tractor onto a flatbed. It looks like a weird ladder, but I know it will look great once the wisteria grows another few feet.
Besides, they are the only holsters I own that I can clean by tossing in the dishwasher.

The breakfast was a casual affair at a local restaurant, but I was glad I had gotten up a whole six minutes earlier than usual to primp since everyone there was dressed in business attire. After we were done eating they moved on to the very official awards ceremony, where they called each of us up individually and handed us a certificate and a small pin. (Does anyone ever wear these pins? I don’t think so. Maybe they should have some sort of national program where everyone sends in their service pins and they’re melted down and made into teeth for old people.)

Here’s one of the signature dishes of the restaurant, aptly named “Chicken Chop” with no Farsi name. These are entire chicken legs that have peen peeled off the bone to resemble lamb chops and have been marinated in a crazy-good seasoning blend and then charcoal broiled. This one is a must-order. Beware of the big roasted Serrano pepper, it will blow your head off if you bite into it. The only cure for it is Doogh.
I did the best I could, but I didn't really feel like she and I "clicked." She seemed pretty stiff and sort of fake--both things that I absolutely am not.

It is very difficult to feel confidence in an administration that has not addressed in meaningful ways the horrors that have occurred to actual bodies, to the Durham community of which we are an integral part, and to our sense of being members of a proactive and caring community.

As you can tell, it’s a great place for people of all ages (it also has a 36-hole golf course)! It’s a nice place for families! You can go and enjoy the park during the day and then not have to drive home. My ONLY and very tiny complaint about the whole place is the long walks. Here is a picture of the hallway that our room was on. I took this at the end of the hall to demonstrate that I’m not just being your average lazy person. Hehe! However, I definitely think if that’s the only thing I could find wrong with the place, then it is really awesome! The long halls wouldn’t stop me from visiting again (actually, I would love to go back and experience the outdoor waterpark). I just want my readers to feel like they’ve actually been there and seen the whole place. Wilderness at the Smokies provides a fun experience for the whole family and even has a friendly staff! The check-in and check-out were quick, easy, and painless! I would definitely go back there!

Why didn't the midwife tell me, after I'd gone in several times for bleeding, that I wasn't a candidate for midwifery care anymore? Why didn't I get an ultrasound to look for the source of that bleeding? Why didn't she know that the presence of blood could give a false negative on a ferning test? Why didn't she order an ultrasound immediately upon my coming in with the concern that my water had broken? In retrospect, waiting three days was completely insane. But I trusted her when she said everything was okay. Why didn't she consult with one of the doctors at that point? The midwife practice I was seeing was in a hospital, and shared office space, staff, and the L&D area with both the regular OBs and the high-risk doctors. Why didn't I insist on a second opinion??
presque vu
I bought this dress last Spring and I love wearing it. It’s not the most comfortable dress ever because the bodice is boned front and back, but on the plus side it has a gorgeous shape and keeps me sitting upright! I’m wearing it here with a petticoat underneath it but the skirt also looks good without. It’s hard not to be happy in this dress! I’ll be honest, though. It was slightly impractical for the afternoon’s activities. Nic and I met some friends at the Jazz Jam in Wilde’s – it was really busy and a full, fluffy petticoat made getting through the crowds more difficult than it might have been otherwise! That aside, it was a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. Wilde’s is a gorgeous setting for the music, and it’s hard to beat sipping mojitos in the sunshine and chatting with friends, and knowing you don’t have to go to work in the morning! After the music a group of us went for dinner at a nearby Mexican restaurant before Nic and I took our sleepy selves home.

Watching a design show one day I came across a cool company called Canvas Pop (http://www.canvaspop.com/). Their specialty is taking your average picture and turning it into a canvas print. I thought this was a cool idea and would definitely give me a piece of artwork that no one else had. But what to print up? Now, I'm lucky, I happen to have a library of pictures in my computer. Thousands upon thousands of family pictures, spanning almost 7 decades. After pouring over my stash, I saw it, the perfect picture. Artistically speaking, it was taken at such an optimum moment. The symmetry and the movement of the photograph is perfect - it could not have been timed better. And what makes it even more awesome - that it was taken by my Dad.
And they do not allow to make photos, too.

Some of the smaller, younger doves are very trusting of us and won't fly away even when we're up close. They must realize that we are the ones who put the bird seed out.

Plus, I went and had dinner with a really dear friend’s mum, which was great as she is the lovely est lady and pretty unreal for someone who’s over 90. I love my own mum to death, and I’m going off for the day to visit her this coming weekend, but she isn’t travelling nearly as well. But again, I enjoyed the experience and the meal, so maybe the merit has already been earned again, so = Zero points

“The last night we were there, Dr. Devoe came to my hotel room. He pulled me out into the hallway and asked me to take a walk with him. I was tired. I’d just played a concert that night at the conservatory. But he insisted. He said he had something to tell me. I asked why we couldn’t talk in my room, and he said, ‘Because they’re listening.’”

By far the most interesting thing I did not know about David Clark, is that his South Shields seat was one of the safest Labour seats in the UK. It was much coveted by those bright young things in the New Labour Party, particularly the then head of the Number 10 Policy Unit, one David Miliband, who had absolutely no connection to the constituency, other than the attraction that they weigh the Labour vote there rather than count it. Clark's constituency branch caught wind of this and fought his reselection in 2001, for fear of Clark rolling over on his belly for a seat in the House of Lords, thus allowing the National Executive Committee to parachute in their own candidate, who would have little

Take a quick look at the last sentence before the boilerplate was thrown in. and I quote “The Company’s prior guidance for revenue and free cash flow remains unchanged.” Ok so you got a block buster that will be increasing earnings per share but management says revenue and free cash flow will remain unchanged. Hmm. How is that possible on this scale? No additional cash flow for the biggest block buster since Harry Potter. The dots do not connect. At least not in a straight line.
When indices divergence like this it is generally a sign of current weakness specific to that particular index. Since the DOW is the international index of the four majors, it is reflecting the general weakness in the international markets. Over 80% are in confirmed downtrends. The SPX/NDX are more US specific, and have not confirmed that weakness yet. There is also the factor of futures related volatility. The DOW and NAZ are less sensitive to futures activity than the heavily traded SPX and NDX.

While we wait for the verdict of the court, due sometime this summer, Congressional Republicans need to take the opportunity to talk about their free market solutions in the event the law is struck down. Having a series of small bills that would implement those solutions at the ready would be a wise decision as well, particularly since the White House has decided to forgo a contingency plan, preferring to keep all of their eggs in the ObamaCare basket.

My project:
The workout was highly effective. I pushed myself, and while I didn't finish everything on the sheet, I got further than I think I ever have before, having had the privilege of being an experienced boot camper. We worked for forty minutes, and I have to say the time went by incredibly fast. When we were done, I was drenched with sweat and my face, being the Scotch-Irish-English American mutt that I am, was bright red. Totally normal for me if I exert myself for more than five minutes.
Having medical information online has a number of benefits. Digital records can be stored conveniently and without taking up any physical space with everything in one location. A search bar makes finding the documents you're looking for quick. There is also the convenience of having your personal information available to you whenever the Internet is. This can be extremely handy if you have to travel for medical care and you need access to your medical records. Medical tourists may find this very useful as well. International health care providers cannot freely access the medical records of Americans thanks to legislation such as HIPAA. A medical tourist can use Google Health to get access to all of their medical records while abroad.

We are chosen, royal, holy, and adopted! We have got to embrace that identity and start acting like it. Many Christians walk around like Eeyore when they should be bouncing off the walls like Tigger. Where’s the joy, adopted one? Where’s the security, you who are chosen? God has called us out of darkness and into His glorious light, yet we continue to run for the shadows. We forget who we are and let the lie define us. We get caught in the trap of who we used to be and it keeps us from living for Him.
I’ve had arguments about him “just being young”, and “a little rash”, or “hotheaded”, and I remember Rooney also doing stupid petty vindictive things when he was younger (not so very long ago either).

For these dangerous and divisive elements the legislation proposed in the Race Relations Bill is the very pabulum they need to flourish. Here is the means of showing that the immigrant communities can organise to consolidate their members, to agitate and campaign against their fellow citizens, and to overawe and dominate the rest with the legal weapons which the ignorant and the ill-informed have provided.

Read an interesting cover story in The New York Times Magazine last Sunday about James Patterson. He markets himself better than his publisher does! He told Little Brown he wanted to advertise on TV. They balked so he wrote and paid for the ad himself for Along Came A Spider. Of course, he had to add young adult author to his list and immediately Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Maximum-Ride/James-Patterson/e/9780316067959/?itm=1&USRI=maximum+ride+angel, published in 2005. There are at least 4 books in the series. Fun reading that should interest resistant readers - bird kids being chased by other DNA adapted youth and hiding from the scientist who wants to keep experimenting on them. The young teens and children have bird DNA and can fly away from most of the danger. His newest tween series, Witch and Wizard http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Witch-and-Wizard/James-Patterson/e/9780316072205/?itm=1 is Patterson's newest serries that will help the tweens who are having Harry Potter withdrawal

Like really, one moment he is superdeeduper arrogant then after 5 minutes, he’s Hanna Montana with all rainbows and butterflies. He’s sooo sweet. How did that happened? And don’t even say love, I’m not buying that as an excuse. I know he’s supposed to change but the transition is not done flawlessly. It’s so fast even without hitting a fast forward button. Tsk.
Highlights of the episode were Megan giving Don the song and dance (it made my toes curl thinking Don would be dying inside), the sequence of greetings and hellos when Joanie visited the office and brought the baby in (Pete and Peggy with what might have been?

I just gave you a lot of money. This is a transaction”).

However, it cannot be deemed as the collaboration of the United States and India. India has been pursuing the independent foreign policy and mainly considers its own interests. It is hard to imagine that India will completely follow the foreign policies of the United States. India has an all-round diplomatic policy and it both maintain relations with the United States and takes much count to the relations with other countries. India always keeps a close contact with Russia, Japan and the European Union countries and its relation with China is also positive.

So far as the beer was concerned the Spotted Dog had three ales on tap that day; Black Cat Original, Larkins Traditional and Skinner's Betty Stoggs. I opted for the Black Cat, which was so good I just had to have another, leaving my plans for a pint of Larkins on hold until another occasion. It was a well-hopped, amber coloured ale served with just the right degree of coolness; it certainly slipped down a treat. The pub wasn't packed but there seemed to be plenty of people coming and going. The welcome was warm and friendly and the aforementioned Black Cat beer came with the landlords recommendation, which is always a good sign. We didn't eat at the pub, having eaten our prepared rolls en route, but the food selection looked good and would have complement the beer well.
In the midst of a busy and complicated part of the summer for our family I decided to take an impromptu break from my weekly blog writing. It started out as just another delayed posting, something that had become frequent over the summer. But after spending ten days in late July visiting with my parents and three of my closest friends and then taking another three days or so to recover from it all, a few items arose with the house we have been trying to sell. After more than a year, a potential buyer had finally emerged, and we made a push to make sure the house was in great shape for their decisive walk-through. In order to handle those details, I decided to let another week slide by without a blog entry. Since then we have undergone a multi-week frenzy of real estate selling and real estate shopping that continues to soak up more of my life than I wish. It has been difficult to think about anything else, including putting together a blog post.

So, in summary: you've got some great things going on here. In particular, you have some moments of such wonderful, vibrant voice, I think you may garner some requests based on that alone.

But man alive, she just looks way too little out there waving like crazy to me in the morning. I'll blow her kisses through the window and she'll "catch" them and shove them in her quiet-time pillow-pet unicorn's toosh. So sweet. I tell her to wave at me when she gets on the bus otherwise I'll cry. She forgets. When she gets home I playfully tell her I was sad she didn't wave at me AGAIN and she smiles and says "But mom, I wave at you before I get on the bus and when I get on, I get to busy talking to my friends." And so it begins.

If you do it first, they can’t do it to you: they can’t tell you anything you don’t already know, or hurt you any more than you have already hurt yourself. If you do it, you can do it right: you can make a list longer than they would ever have thought of, so there is no possible way they can come up with something new, some unguarded fleshy spot into which they can slip the knife. If you do it yourself, everything is scar tissue, tough as rope you have already hung yourself with in every possible way.
Hope that you had a happy weekend with your family!
The Lord’s prayer says, “forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.” In practical, financial terminology, to forgive a debt means that you stop demanding restitution. You let go of what’s owed you, of payback, of outcome. It’s not a holier-than-thou thing; it’s just realistic. You stop trying to collect interest on paper when there are no checks in the mail anyway. You write the debt off the books. You cut your losses. You start over financially. You invest elsewhere.
So glad to be home again and getting back into old routine.
For this Mother's Day, I told her before I even made this, what I was going to give her, and that it would be on my blog for you to make for you moms too.

They really reminded me of fall.

Back to KDP Select. Raising the price to $2.99 did increase the borrowing as I'd expected, since Seven had 14 borrows from December 8-21 and 21 in the shorter time from December 21-31. Still, the total was only 35. On its own, though, the number meant nothing. Whether it was good, bad, or indifferent depended on how the other KDP authors had done.
Last week we explored the alphabet and made our Chicka Chicka Boom Boom trees! They turned out great! We gave the kids 5 pre-cut leaves and coconuts. The kids then used tear art to make the tree trunk from brown paper. They then found the letters in their name from an alphabet sheet and made their name going up the coconut tree.

Another issue we've dealt with this week is pecking. One afternoon a Barred Rock pullet was bloody as all get out on her comb and head. Turns out it was just her comb. We weren't totally sure how to handle it, but so far what we've done has worked. We grabbed her up, cleaned up her head and put iodine on her comb. We then separated her from the flock. We put Josie's crate inside the chicken yard with some food and water in it for her. That night we slathered an anti-bacterial cream on her comb and put her in the coop to roost. She was all dried up and looking much better by morning. She is still healing with no further assault so hopefully the Rhode Island Red that was bothering her has stopped.
I have been thinking about this a lot this week.

Answer: I think we were successful in obtaining a large audience in such a short amount of time because of our authenticity, our writings where we’ve never published anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves, but the most important thing we did was add value to peoples lives.

This data is also certainly not “a comparison of more direct measurements” as the NASA graph states or an average of the data given as the NOAA source link.

Leading on from this, we were late again submitting the books to the Electoral Commission and the Party was fined as a result. This should not have happened as it could have been avoided and has cost the Party money. It is another indication that the accounting side of things needs scrutiny and overhaul.
First of all, I never claimed to be sane. I have to admit it was really overwhelming at first. I mean, it's not everyday you get an email from Harpo Productions in your inbox. When I was doing a couple radio interviews a week, it was a bit nervewracking, but I finally put it in perspective - I have six kids. You can't scare me!

My thoughts: omfg you guys have no idea how excited I am about this. Basically my favouritest YA Vampire Romance guilty pleasure evaaaaaaar. Her world is sprawling and epic and all things wondrous, and I wolf down each new Blue Bloods title with glee. IS IT JULY YET?! (Also, to all those who are clamouring about how fallen angels are the next big thing, well, guess what? In Blue Bloods - VAMPIRES = FALLEN ANGELS. LAWL.)

Call me a cynic but I believe that the decision to kill Osama bin Laden was not taken until the 2012 elections became a priority. Why? Because three terrorist attacks, including the Fort Hood murders, had previously been swept under the rug by the Obama administration. Moreover, the Obama Justice Department continues to threaten CIA agents with jail for the aggressive interrogation techniques that led to finding bin laden.

My own explanation of why their son is a psycho was that the kid was probably swapped at the hospital. Clearly, he can’t be theirs. Who casts these films? Fail.
Then there's the pre-surgery stuff. I still have another post-op appointment to go to where they'll check my heart, take x-rays of my chest, take blood, and so on. Then I have to do that nasty bowel prep (gag!) the day before my surgery. Y'know what? After it's all said and done, I'm looking forward to them knocking me out!

Now look at how Alona describes it: “I shivered in the cool morning breeze. It was 7:00 a.m., or a little past, on the first day in May, and it wasn’t nearly warm enough to be out walking around in the stupid thin T-shirt and short shorts they made us wear for gym.” This also gives us a very clear image of what this morning is like, but we experience it THROUGH HER eyes. We are COMPLETELY focused on HER world, HER experiences, how SHE is letting us see this.

“Fine” simply means that the sky will probably be overcast and grey and that it is unlikely to rain – though there may be light drizzle.
So then were to this little thing called my freely running mouth again!!! So my oldest son that i like to call my trial and error (Which my trial and error is a pretty good kid) Ok trial and error has a free running mouth too. I Have no idea where it came from hmmm?? Where o where ok.. Anyway back on track here. So I butted in a few times and that really pissed Tyler off.. Ok in my defense I thought if I wasn't yelling it would be ok to but in if I said "Honey (In my sweet voice) thats not what he meant and no he doesnt." Well apparently it doesnt matter which way you butt in butting in is butting in. Well Tyler freely ran his mouth and said a few things that hurt not verbally abuse just swearing and yelling at me OUCH!!! Well i spent a week having poor me syndrome. Yes he let me know Poor me OUCH!!! again. Sooo it was really bad by Friday but my bro-in law (Sisters husband) had open heart surgery and I had all there grandkids here so the kids could be at the hospital. so no time for discipline or maintenance.

Ever since playing the beta/demo, I was hooked. Normally I don’t tend to stray from the triple A shooter that falls every November and we are all familiar with. But to be honest, I hadn’t heard a huge amount about the game before it dropped on the Game Marketplace, and was enticed by the videos that quickly followed across YouTube and their own website.
After a mile of uphill hiking, I began to get above the tree line and was rewarded with some great views of Bubble pond below, Cadillac mountain directly across from me, and the Atlantic Ocean beyond. In the opposite direction, I could see across Frenchman’s Bay to the mainland of Maine (pictured below).

So, I know the past like...million weekends I have talked about getting that coffee table re-do done. And this weekend truly was going to do it. Friday night at dinner I was plotting to my parents how I was dragging that puppy into the back yard to TCB (Take Care of Business) in the morning. It would be a new table by Saturday night.
Although there isn't too many GF options on their menu, the staff at Fabio & Danny's are always willing to modify their food options for their GF clients.

After check in all the volunteers were given a lanyard with our names on them, a tasting cup and a bright orange t-shirt that had the American Craft Beer Fest logo on the front and a giant “EVENT STAFF” written across the back. We were told where we were needed most and went to check in with our captains (a glorified camp counselor). Our first task of the day was to empty the water that had accumulated in the keg buckets after the ice had melted. It didn’t seem too bad at first but a lot of the kegs were still hooked up to the systems and had a substantial amount of beer left in them. It sometimes took about 2 men to remove the keg out from the bucket and and then another to empty it. Many of the brewers hid their kegs under the tables so pulling them out was awful and I got whacked pretty good on my shin after a still connected CO2 cylinder jumped out from behind the table to attack me while I was taking the keg out of the barrel. After an hour, 20 kegs later and a bruised shin we were done and told to grab some coffee before checking in for the next shift.
It was SO bright! OH. my. goodness., it was screaming apple green. The way the light hit it made it completely obnoxious. So I mixed some black into the green to darken it a bit, and painted…again.

Also wanted to mention that since I still owe the printer $435.00 I am having a special for the new printed cook book. It has a bright green cover and everything is printed on both sides and will be selling them for $22.00 and free shipping until I get the print shop paid off. I have some with the black binder and some are white so you can choose until I run out of the black. You can click on the link on my right side bar to order your copy and I will be checking my emails every chance I get and will get back to you A S A P with address to mail a ck.

They came from the lovely Linen Cat, do pop over and see her shop - she makes the most amazing things, not only birds but other wonderful things like a Fox in a Dandy Green Suit - just stunning. See that extra little pink bird, that little birdie was a lovely surprise which now lives with my Mum. I showed my Mum these lovely birds when they arrived and she ooohhed and aahhhed over them as much as I did so I gave her one to have in her home as she loved it so much.
The cat was quite hairy. And by 'quite' I mean, oh-my-god-that's-disgusting, type hairy. It was, not to mince words, a shedding filth machine.
Of course this is like arguing for the need for Cardiff to be IN Bristol whilst simultaneously Bristol is WITHIN Cardiff: it sounds more like the premise for an episode of Doctor Who than a structure by which to determine the pathway through two mammoth systems of state coercion and control.

As mentioned previously, many of the major international and proselytizing religions were incredibly syncretistic. Some of them–like Christianity and Islam–were ill-disposed toward syncretism, despite being highly syncretistic themselves in their initial periods, and what they would like everyone to believe to the contrary. However, other religions or strains of these religions remained more friendly and open to syncretism. Gnosticism within Christianity was particularly friendly to syncretism, and incorporated any number of elements from various polytheistic traditions into its worldviews, texts, and practices; and, there is a strong possibility that it may have had a great deal of influence from Buddhism in doing this. Buddhism itself has been a very syncretistic religion, with a basis in a reformed view of Hinduism, but a manner of either absorbing other religion’s influences and deities, or incorporating them into new schools within itself, or of simply existing alongside them. Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet, Mongolia, and elsewhere incorporates many elements of shamanism and the Bon-Po indigenous religion of Tibet to give it its distinctive character. Ch’an Buddhism developed in China in response to certain elements in Taoism, and was thereby transmitted to Japan as Zen. Many different forms of Buddhism exist in Japan, either alongside Shinto, or forming combined traditions with it like the Yamabushi tradition.
Then I saw him. His face lined with hard facial features, just as Toni had described. Cobalt blue eyes, with his chin resting on his tattooed forearms. He was ordering food from a roadside stand; his arms perched on the countertop. His black hair shaggy, yet stick straight. He was a little unwavering, with his casual appearance, but he was not as unknowing as the people around him. He could be the one.

As children love repetition and I love spending more time on one story, I use each story for two weeks. We set up playdough activities, simple games and a craft for the children to use after they have heard the story read to them. For example, last week we read the story of Zacchaeus. Before reading the story the children made trees from playdough and put together simple tree puzzles. Puzzles were made by gluing a picture of a tree onto thick cardboard and then cutting the picture into three or four simple pieces. With some help from leaders, the children also sorted toys into big and little piles. After the story reading, we made Zacchaeus in a tree models. The children coloured a rectangle of cardboard with brown crayon and a leader rolled each rectangle into a cylinder to make the tree trunk. We photocopied a picture of Zacchaeus in the tree onto a tree shaped outline. Children coloured in Zacchaeus and glued green leaves onto the picture. When children were finished, this leafy part of the true was glued onto the tree trunk. Next week the same activities will be available for the children and we will have a new craft for them to do.
The second question, and subsequent answer, require much inspection, but at the present moment, we are most concerned with how nature is materially possible. This is because the formal conditions for the possibility of nature pertain to the understanding, whereas, at present, our inquiry is primarily concerned with Kant’s musings on objects of experience ‘in’ space and time. For Kant, the latter is an investigation firstly of sensibility.
The next thing Alice knew there was a sudden movement in a tree above her, and she ran as fast as she could up and along the path constantly looking behind her to see if anything was following her. She ran for as long she could until, partly due to the light, partly due to fatigue, she tripped over a thick root that lay conveniently along the path. She fell with the full force of her sprinting, and collapsed, face first, biting into and removing a large, fleshy segment from the inside of her bottom lip. There she lay, panting, with blood flooding from her lips that matched the colour, and onto her cloak that did the same. As she did so she noticed the scurrying grew closer and seemed to be coming from behind her; she turned onto her back, ready to face the creature if she must.

Goals which change the result such as equalisers and go-ahead goals are weighted as 1.5, goals which extend a lead to 2 goals or bring a deficit back to 1 goal are weighted as 1, and goals which extend a lead to 3 goals (or more) or bring back the deficit to two goals (or more) are weighted as 0.5. This is then divided by the number of goals scored to give the Weighted Goal Return (WGR), which will be a number between 0.5 and 1.5. The higher the better. Therefore, Ronaldo and Messi, while admittedly great players, score a lot of goals when games essentially dead (huge leads) and therefore they only end up with a WGR of 1.09 and 0.99 respectively.

The Institute of Economic Affairs has been around since 1955 and is one of the country's most prestigious think tanks.

At the very least, I have found out that this humble shop has a comprehensive supply of many kinds of herbal plants, imported from Johor Bahru. Each of the tour participants were given pandan leaves and stalks of lemon grass so that we can make a herbal drink for ourselves at home.

On Monday I stumbled across my bright orange wooden fish that sits on my nightstand.

It's terrible really, but I am ashamed to say that I haven't travelled all that much in England (it seems I hardly leave London these days), so when I do, I am always so pleasantly overwhelmed by the beauty and vastness of the green spaces that are to be enjoyed outside of this smoky old town.

Running on a treadmill is different than running outdoors, but I attribute my PR at the Turkey Trot to the treadmill runs. I get comfortable with the uncomfortableness of a speed when I’m using the treadmill vs. running outside. I still like to run outside, but with it being so incredible dark in the morning (my preferred workout time) I started using the treadmill at the gym instead. It’s also great to be on a schedule instead of just trying to fit it in wherever.
Anyway, now that I'm gainfully employed and speak French relatively well, I find myself revisiting my design ideas and longing to get my hands on better materials and take a class. This is proving to be next to impossible and has lead to more than one dead end. The art of reliure is still very much alive and well in France but, unfortunately, not anywhere near me. If I were to follow a serious course that results in a diploma, I'd have to figure out how to get to Paris once or twice a week, and my meager salary would hardly handle that. The médiatheque of Troyes is doing a 10 month course but it only meets once a month so that doesn't seem very encouraging. They're actually doing a stage that lasts an entire week in March but I haven't been working long enough to have a week off yet (nevermind what I would do with Fry for a week while I'm playing with paper and glue!).
In the midst of this emotional turmoil, there are some people who thought they know better and told me how I should feel. There were also those people who had shown greed, pretense, unscrupulousness, and fake compassion.

It's not fair of course because for screenwriter Arthur Miller the heat was on to perform as a genius and he must have been suffering from the same slow anti-wally poison since he'd been coming off his marriage to Marilyn. When you're in love / with a beautiful woman / you can't keep from cryin'. There's a Charlie McCarthy show episode where Charlie's going to marry Monroe and the bulk of the show is spent with her being hit on by everyone from Arthur Godfrey to Winston Churchill. all vainly trying to wrest her away from Charlie's splintery arms. Surely the marines didn't view splintery Arthur Miller as competition any more than they did McCarthy, despite the power of the pen. Guido seems to be the receptacle for all that passive aggressive rage Miller surely felt. I recognize the rage, but I also know those characters don't add much to a 'fun' time at the movies.

Speaking of tomorrow, I have a very busy day. In the morning, I have a practice AP calc test. After that, some of us who are taking the BC Calc test are staying after to study some Calc BC material. Luke is going to the practice AP test and he’s going to stay through my BC study session because we’re going to go look at tux’s to rent for prom. Personally, I don’t have a problem with him just wearing his band tux, but JP wouldn’t have it. He has to rent one. Oh well. Then, we’re going to work on the Chem thing.

It isn’t all about performing when there isn’t much improvement at the end of the day. I don’t consider myself performing when I’m part of the performance without actually playing confidently and contributing to the success of the performance.
Fernandes’ rant was triggered by the hike in airport tax, landing and parking charges which took effect yesterday.
People with a balanced 6th chakra see life in a more balanced way. They can see the positives even in challenging situations. They learn from difficult situations without feeling victimized. They are able to trust that things will work out, knowing that they always do even though the facts at the moment are not looking promising. They can use their intellect as well as their imaginations to accomplish great things. They realize that we are all spiritual beings currently in physical form. We can only access the spiritual part of ourselves when we quiet the mind.
It was with thoughts of the wurzels, and much “ooo arrr” that I cracked open a couple of ciders whilst sat in my favourite position in front of the telly. There has been quite a revitalisation of cider over the few years prompted initially by the success of the Magners brand selling premium priced grog to UK punters. This would naturally lead to other producers having a bash promoting their own cider brands or creating them (see super normal profit, how it prompts market entry from competition, moving the market to normal profit equilibrium and explaining full well why Magners have never repeated their initial success and never will again regardless of whatever brand extension they attempt , or whatever the company says to the markets) These days you can find a fair few premium priced ciders on the shelves. I gather there has been a knock on effect for “real cider” too, a wince inducing product beloved of the bearded members of our community. There is of course one cynical reason you can assume with some brands. With alcopop suffering at the hands of the tax man and seen as a product hawked at kids, you can produce something sweet and fizzy as a fermentation rather than mixing an ethanol distillation and call it cider and hawk it at that important part of the market for people that want to get pissed but don’t like the taste of drink. A market not only containing teenagers, but indeed some adults.
Here, the weather has been PERFECT and today we spent a good bit of time at the beach (as you can see from the photo). It was incredible! A little windy and cool in the shade, but Daniel even went swimming. It felt like vacation. We even had a big group of dolphins (including at least two babies) come by and put on a show for us. They were jumping and playing and splashing around right in front of Daniel when he was in the water. One of those perfect moments, you know?
What are the basics
The “Bush doctrine” and the “war on terror” were not the panacea for the global terrorism threat nor did they provide more security to Americans and more freedom to oppressed Middle-Easterners. All they did was make us more suspicious and afraid of each other. Senseless murder and blinding hate led to more of the same.
One of the regular themes in the blogs and tweets of the participants of the challenge is that they’re bored of eating low-cost food. This is part of what worries me about this challenge. If it were truly challenging people to bolster their sense of compassion and humanity, boredom wouldn’t be a major theme. When people really start connecting with their shared humanity, really start noticing the genuine ways they can help to alleviate the suffering of others. There is an excitement that kicks in. A willingness to move, to act, to do. To find ways to make things happen and change. Not boredom. One of the most inspiring examples I’ve seen of this was Jessica Jackley’s talk at TED.com:
Stir together dry ingredients. Add eggs, milk, and vanilla. Fold in vanilla beans. Mix until dry ingredients are moistened. Chop 1 cup of cherries into fine pieces. You can either stir them into the batter (the pancakes will turn reddish-blue in color) or drop the cherries in the batter while each pancake is cooking. To cook, heat a griddle or skillet on medium heat and pout in 1/4 cup of batter. Flip once tiny bubbles appear on the pancakes.

I'm just waiting for the day one of those rides come crashing down because the bolt or the lug or the nut or the screw or the whatever it is that holds the whole thing together has gotten lodged in an unfortunate place and extricating it from Candy the Crack Whore is going to cost an additional $25. And let's face it, how many ride-putter-together people have an extra 25 bucks lying around? I mean, besides the 25 they shelled out for some late night companionship behind the taco/gyro/turkey leg wagon.

The second thing that really excites me about the Treasury membership is the soon-to-be released Notebooking Publisher. I am not all that handy with computer programs. While I would love to personalize notebooking pages to my children’s passions, I just don’t have time to figure out how to do it. The Notebooking Publisher will make this easy! I can work with premade templates and customize them or even start from scratch, then save or print each notebooking page. This means I can easily design pages to go with a special interest or my children can too! Access to The Notebooking Publisher, once released next month, is included in the Treasury membership. Learn more about the Notebooking Publisher right here.
Before we look at the ways to avoid specific toxins, here are some general guidelines any health-conscious person should apply at all times: Avoid processed foods and artificial drinks. Instead, look for organic and locally grown produce or, even better, grow your own fruits, vegetables and herbs. By doing so, you automatically avoid many harmful substances, including MSG, HFCS, pesticides, sodium fluoride and mercury. You also save money, which is always nice. When buying groceries, always read the labels and, as they say, if you can’t read it, don’t eat it.

Sunday involved packing up my seattle bedroom to ready it for the pod, which arrived Monday morning. And thank god for Kamel, my father, and Claire who waited around for a bajillion hours for the pod man to arrive and then lugged (were currently lugging while I wrote most of this post) all of my furniture and boxes of books down three flights of stairs and into a shipping box. And now we wait until next monday. Ugh!! this whole month of moving thing has been a trial unto itself. My advice to anyone moving - as much as it sucks - do it in a week or less. The slow death of an apartment in favor of another leaves you furniture-less and with no place to sit or eat meals. It makes being home awfully lonely. But next week Kamel and I will really be home! Sitting on our couch! Cooking in our kitchen! And finally sleeping in my amazing pillow top queen sized bed. Oh the naps to be had!

One of the first shrubs I planted in my own garden, and which I still absolutely love, is Viburnum sargentii ‘Onondaga’. It’s just one of those great value shrubs that I wouldn’t be without. A tall upright shrub (up to 2.5m high), it has very attractive maple-like leaves which are bronze when they open, turning green with purple tints, and finally orange in autumn. The lacecap flowers are really stunning, opening from the outside in, and are followed by red berries. Happy in sun or shade, and a good reliable grower on most soils, what more could you want from a shrub?!
Anyway, we claimed on the insurance and it paid off the loan, but because there’s a penalty for paying the loan off early we ended up with not enough to buy another car.

The typical arguments in a case like this are that on the one hand, we can’t take every Cuban who wants to come here, just as we can’t take in every Mexican. Balanced against that is the argument that we ought not to turn them all away. But it seems to me that the best solution is to do one or the other. Either we should tell Cubans that they absolutely are not welcome here, in the hope that it would discourage them from trying to make the dangerous journey to Florida, or we should bring everyone here who we find on land or at sea, and only send them back if there are obvious reasons not to keep them. The route we have chosen instead is the most inhumane policy of all.

If you have this belief, then there are other assumptions that follow. You might think, for example, that you could compare the mind and body with software (the programming) and hardware (the physical components) of a computer. So if your computer stops working, you first have to figure out whether it is a hardware or software problem. Is it that the Windows Vista has corrupt files or a virus so can no longer boot up, or has the keyboard broken or the motherboard fried – in which case no amount of software changes are going to make any difference – the hardware needs to be physically fixed or replaced.

Undead is the total Death Metal package. I mean, I cannot describe it any better than that. I wrote an earlier review on a three song sampler from this Undead album and praised Six Feet Under for what I absorbed sonically. Listening to and enjoying the entire Undead album only solidifies my Metal points made from that prior review.
I truly dislike the way these recordings surfaced publicly, obviously outside the official 12" release which I fully supported. There was no discussion, no humility, no essential background given within the YouTube postings - because Mr. YouTube had access to none of that (and I doubt he can define humility if it were demanded of him - one only need to see his comments on his YouTube page, and elsewhere, for evidence). Whether it be detailed liner notes inside a CD/box set package, a detailed press release, a detailed blog post with insider information, or, the "the statement is the music" ideal as realized by Saville's considered minimalism of the official 12", this material - by its nature - deserves careful, respectful treatment which completely escaped the YouTube postings. Not that I believe Mr. YouTube would have done so anyway, even given half the chance.

Now I could go on like a love sick poetic puppy for hours about this fantastic woman, but this is a beer blog and I’m sure you don’t really care that much about my personal life. Making the best of the situation, I’m going to visit a vast amount of the great pubs in Manchester so I can try all the beer made by the local breweries in and around the city so that I can tell you all about them and hopefully in the process, show these northerners just how us southern jesses can drink!!…….like I say……Its not going to end well.

The Falklands War broke out in 1982, some 30 years ago, when roughly 3,140 English citizens on the islands witnessed an invasion by thousands of Argentine troops. After ignoring a UN Resolution calling for a withdrawal, a British submarine sank the Gen. Belgrano, an Argentine ship, causing 362 sailors to die at sea, and soon thereafter, Argentina’s military junta surrendered. 13 years later, a different government agreed not to invade again, as weekly flights between the islands and Argentina resumed.

Even at the best of times, the royal court at Rhíminee is a serpents’ nest of intrigue, but with the war against Plenimar going badly, treason simmers just below the surface.

For someone who believed there are multiple soulmates out there, I did not love like they were. Instead of leaving bad relationships, I stayed until I could no longer bear whatever abuse I was subjecting myself too. Instead of leaving mediocre relationships, I stayed because I surely believed that marriage would be no fantasy, so I was probably setting the bar too high. I thought I needed to live with things being just “alright”. Ya know, once I seriously considered staying with a guy that was a horrible cheater, lier, and manipulator, and other negativities because I was convinced in my heart that was a good as it would get. I need to exhale on that one because I can’t even believe that my mind went there.

At 2:00 PM or so, we finally get in the air for the seven hour flight to Philadelphia.

We land in Philadelphia, but lo and behold there’s no gate available and again we’re left sitting on the tarmac in one hundred degree heat and humidity. The flight crew had ordered a people mover to get us off the plane, but it didn’t come. I knew things were really bad when the pilot put his bags down for the fourth or fifth time and was yelling into his cell phone to get a bus over here so we could all get off the damn plane.

To have recently launched the biggest mall in London was a very brave move despite all the 'green shoots of recovery' bollocks we're hearing. It's a venture that has, in the long term at least, the potential for serving a large catchment area of shoppers who are fed up with having to travel to Oxford Street, Bluewater and Lakeside. The excellent transport links will also beguile away-supporters visiting Loftus Road into parting with a few of their pennies at Westfield.
Through showing dogs, it is nearly impossible to embarrass me. Let's just say that my lovely dog, Mouse, was a character, and he had embarrassed me in the ring to no end.

Mouse is a dog, and he does things that dogs do. Life goes on, no matter how foolish your dog makes you look at a dog show.

Miller is in serious trouble, we find out. After a cryptic message from Earth, all contact is cut off. Our only hint of what’s going on down there comes from a haunting scene of flashes visible from space, flashes which connect directly to clusters of light suddenly going out. Whatever’s going on down there, it’s got to be pretty bad, and it’s possible Miller has no idea as we never see him witness this. Utterly alone, we watch as he tries to maintain his daily routine through the stress and isolation. It’s not clear until near the end just how long he’s been up there (and even then, there’s a bit of a jump forward in time which implies it’s even longer than stated), but we get a sense of it as he starts to come apart at the edges. Much like Moon‘s Sam Bell, Miller is just trying to keep it together in extraordinary circumstances. We watch as he devises ways to pass the time, invents relationships with predecessors based on their photos (one, a woman, becomes a sort of imaginary companion), and ultimately descends into a kind of half-mad squalor characterized by a frenzy of subtle and not-so-subtle artistic expression. Chaotic little sculptures are the first of it, made from whatever materials are handy. Eventually, Miller begins to draw scenes and figures from what could be Briggs’ experiences.

What I didn’t like as much: Unfortunately, Cass. She seems kind of cardboard compared to the other characters in Viper Moon. Her snake, Nefertiti, seems better developed than Cass.

In fact, I put the book down several times to read other stories since I kept losing interest in Cass.

Almost all of Agatha Christie’s books are whodunits, focusing on the British middle and upper classes. Usually, the detective either stumbles across the murder or is called upon by an old acquaintance, who is somehow involved. Gradually, the detective interrogates each suspect, examines the scene of the crime and makes a note of each clue, so readers can analyze it and be allowed a fair chance of solving the mystery themselves. Then, about halfway through, or sometimes even during the final act, one of the suspects usually dies, often because they have inadvertently deduced the killer’s identity and need silencing. In a few of her novels, including Death Comes as the End and And Then There Were None, there are multiple victims. Finally, the detective organises a meeting of all the suspects and slowly denounces the guilty party, exposing several unrelated secrets along the way, sometimes over the course of thirty or so pages. The murders are often extremely ingenious, involving some convoluted piece of deception. Christie’s stories are also known for their taut atmosphere and strong psychological suspense, developed from the deliberately slow pace of her prose.

In a nutshell we were discussing that there are two key groups of people that are focused on changing the world; those who focus on the idea(s) that they believe are important in order to bring about change and those who focus on the actions that are needed to bring about change. These people are actually sprinkled throughout society, but we often think of them clustered around non-profit organizations. Church, mission, aid, feeding, and educational organizations make up these non-profits and actually contain both kinds of people. It seems many stop at simply claiming their way of helping the world is the most important, but in truth all types of help are needed and effective when motivated by a true desire to bring value to those less fortunate. Although most of the “action” oriented groups can appreciate one another, many of the idea groups have trouble seeing any overlap in their ideologies and spend most of their time slinging mud at each other, rarely entering into the kind of co-operative efforts that will be needed to make lasting change.

And while we’re using musical analogies, here’s the best way I can describe this episode: “The Earth King” is to Avatar: the Last Airbender as A Hard Day’s Night (the album, not the movie) is to the Beatles’ entire discography. Both of these works show the creators in top form as they breeze through material that does absolutely nothing to highlight what makes them such geniuses in the first place. There’s nothing going on beneath the surface beyond the fact that these are just perfectly crafted products with little of the personality that used to make them so interesting.
‘But with me, he made it a big thing. The public love the judges and they’re going to go by what the judges say.’
Publishers publish fake books because, if you have an “author” who has some larger cause to promote, the publisher gets free promotion. What the publisher has traded for such an abundance of promotion is its own brand. HarperCollins does not really believe Sarah Palin has written a valuable book—or even that it is really a book, not in the way that HarperCollins has historically understood books, or in the way that people have counted on HarperCollins to have understood a book. But, these are desperate times and real books are an increasingly equivocal proposition anyway, so almost all publishers are willing to engage in the strategic mix-up between real books and fake books.

Clearly, whatever happened to her to get her to this point, she isn't as happy as she claims, especially when it comes to her love life. Throughout the film, though, Rohmer shows us situations in which Delphine has a chance to try to curb some of that unhappiness, but—through an elusive combination of pride, overintellectualizing and self-pity—is unable or unwilling to cross that bridge. Her more outgoing friend Françoise (Rosette) invites her to stay with her family in Cherbourg, but instead of venturing out and socializing with people, she mostly sticks around the house, playing with the kids and occasionally going off to the nearby woods to quietly mope. Back in the Left Bank, where she lives, a random guy eyes her while she's sitting on a bench; he follows her and tries to engage her, but she turns to him and flat-out refuses his overtures.

Yesterday I was about ready to throw in the towel. Two really bad days in a row left me emotionally drained. I actually threatened to put Bug back in ps. Not my greatest Mom moment, but I was at the end of my rope. I had to remind myself of all the reasons I am putting myself through this. You know, it is very easy to find information and blogs chronicling the advantages of homeschooling. They all make it sound so easy, so beautiful, so natural. Well, it isn't. Truth is, homeschooling is hard work.

LA: Ah, well, basically early last year George Mann asked me for a fantasy short for the Solaris Book of New Fantasy series, and then did me an immense favor by not telling me that the project was off when Solaris went up for sale (else I never would have finished it). I used the opportunity to test the characters for the YA - they've been in my head for several years now - and wrote the story as occurring six months after the end of the novel. Though the anthology never came out, George and enough test readers were happy with the story that I was encouraged to tackle the novel for my NaNoWriMo. I have to say NaNoWriMo was one of the hardest experiences of my life, mostly for the strain it put on my family, who were very patient with me, and because I had not one but two convention appearances to make during the month of November (including a GoH spot at OryCon). I actually finished the 50k words at Friday night between 2am and 3am at the hotel room in Portland. I put it all aside, and have spent the time in between polishing the S&S short. I thought the NaNoWriMo results were all a jumbled, disjointed mess, but just read them through this past Sunday and was stunned to find that's only true of the last two to three thousand words. The first forty-eight thousand are actually pretty damn solid! My harshest critic (my wife) is currently reading through it now, and after I get her feedback I'm going to start in on the second half. So I have to say I found NaNoWriMo incredible beneficial, if an exhausting marathon. What was the most amazing to me was the way it forced you to write even when the tank was on empty, and related to that, how what came out at such times wasn't the garbage you would expect.
In order to break up the group, the facilitator said he was going to cancel meetings for a month so we could evaluate ourselves, and then if we really, really, really needed the group, we could return. This stunned the heck out of me. Because he thought some people had overstayed their welcome, he was going to leave the newly bereft without any support for a month!! With Father’s Day almost here? He finally agreed to cancel only a single meeting, but still, the whole concept is appalling.
At UK, it was a matter of photographing typed transcripts of someone else’s notes. What bliss! Rather than stand over the copy machine (I also did that) for hours, I could set up the photos I took photos of and click away. It worked better when I made a “cage” out of archive boxes so the Ipad would hold steady enough when I clicked the button, but it worked beautifully.
"Michelle and Samantha often remark the same way," he added, to laughter.
Analyzing your rec to print with your royalty statement allows you to assess whether an audit is necessary. Given that so many of the big NYC houses are putting limits on look-back for audit (2 years is unfortunately becoming a sort of “standard”), it’s more important than ever to analyze statements and see what action, if any, is necessary.

As a very public persona but still being a private citizen and thus not a public figure as described by the law, who does work in the public arena of discourse I am often attacked for not being willing to discuss things such as current projects (which I am usually under a non-disclosure agreement). I also get criticized for my belief that the public sector needs to provide the most competitive business climate in order to attract, retain and expand business investment in their locales, and thus create and/or preserve jobs.

Programme: Spiritual conferences, socials, Holy Mass each of the three days (Extraordinary Form of the Roman rite) including polyphonic Sunday Mass, silent prayer, private talk with Fr de Malleray, FSSP. Fr de Malleray will explain what a vocation is in general and to the priesthood in particular. Read here the Holy Father's recent Letter to seminarians. Extract: "The proper celebration of the Eucharist involves knowing, understanding and loving the Church's liturgy in its concrete form. In the liturgy we pray with the faithful of every age – the past, the present and the future are joined in one great chorus of prayer. As I can state from personal experience, it is inspiring to learn how it all developed, what a great experience of faith is reflected in the structure of the Mass, and how it has been shaped by the prayer of many generations."

The wider list, those who did not make it to the final poll, seems to me to be both eclectic and eccentric. There was Laksmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi, the token woman, who was prominent in her opposition to the British during the Indian Mutiny. She may be another symbol of national pride but she can hardly be described as a great enemy or a great commander. There was Ntshingwayo kaMahole, the Zulu leader who won the Battle of Isandlawana in 1879, in the long run of things no more than a little local difficulty.

Define Necessity’s intention, I believe, was to call attention to the excess of the holidays and American culture, but campaigns like these are irresponsible. They give an inaccurate picture of Africa, and do nothing to promote social change. Remember the power you hold by sharing a picture on Facebook, or Twitter; take yourself back to those vulnerable moments of sickness, and define the necessity of that decision.

One of my favorite vinyasa yoga teachers once said, “If dropping into stillness is the hardest thing for you to do, then that is what you need the most.” And so, sometime around the first frost, I came to Kripalu to try a meditative practice called yoga nidra. Translated as “yogic sleep” or “divine sleep,” this type of yoga focuses on systematic relaxation of the body while the mind enters a state of deep, meditative awareness—like dreaming while fully awake. The technique was developed by Swami Satyananda in the 1960s to make advanced, centuries-old practices of tantric meditation more accessible to everyone.

My father was not a large man, but he was certainly larger than I am; still, I put the coat on and it fit, in a way.

There's no order, except perhaps the year's passing. I'll make a page for each plant and write all the things I can learn about it - where it grows and when, what ails it heals, and so on.

When I grew up in Troy, Ohio the rustic town of Piqua was my town’s bitter rival. On our court house there is brilliant statue of a woman that is properly faced with her bottom towards the town of Piqua.

A naturopath may talk with the patient about the possible causes for an illness—poor diet, life stresses, occupational dangers, and mental, emotional, and spiritual problems. Naturopaths believe that even widely varying symptoms can sometimes be traced to one underlying cause. Often environmental or metabolic toxins or serious stress bring on an illness.
The big bang is not just a metaphor or a disputed scientific theory about what occurred 14 billion years ago. It’s happening right now. Something is coming from nothing every second. You might not be conscious of it, but it’s true. Your own experience of action and reaction is not unbroken — there are countless moments of zero between each and every thought, every impulse, and every response. Something is coming from nothing, in and through each and every one of us, constantly. If you slow your experience down, and keep slowing it down, you’ll start to see that there is a vast chasm of empty space that is the foundation of everything that is occurring, the ground out of which each impulse arises. Even as you are aware of the body, of the passing of time and the movement of thought, beneath it all you can become conscious of this current of stillness that is the ground of being.

Beautiful Disaster could have easily been one of the best books out there, had more time been taken to explain, develop, and resolve. Unfortunately, it fell short of expectations due to lack of development and erratic behavior from the characters. A possible sequel is in the works and the good parts of the novel may intrigue a reader enough to pick up a copy upon release.

Sprinkle another generous handful of salt. Continue like this until all the cabbage is used. Then pour the rest of the salt water mix on top.

If the gods are finally helpless before evil, men and women must be more so. The heroes and heroines of the early stories face disaster… This is the conception of life which underlies the Norse religion, as somber a conception as the mind of man has ever given birth to. The only sustaining support possible for the human spirit, the one pure unsullied good men can hope to attain, is heroism; and heroism depends on lost causes. The hero can prove what he is only by dying. The power of good is shown not by triumphantly conquering evil, but by continuing to resist evil while facing certain defeat.

We’ll start with the first point. The paintings. They dated from the mid 17th to the early 20th century. There were fifty of them but photographing was forbidden, so unfortunately I can’t recall every single one of them, as much as I would love to. Now, I know that to those of you who live in large cities, seeing art of this caliber is probly commonplace, but in my neck of the woods, it is somewhat of a rarity, and this is the first time in my life I have had the pleasure of seeing such a display. Let me also clarify that I am no art expert. I like art, there are certain artists I like more than others, but I don’t claim to know anything about style or technique or biographical information about the artists themselves. I do know that the two forms of art I tend to prefer are called Impressionist and Surrealist.

Proper names of historical figures, like Einstein, for example, or Napoleon, might be mentioned in a definition, but most likely would not be defined in the dictionary.

With Speilberg directing and Peter Jackson on producing duties, it was down to Steven Moffat to put together a script.

Tortilla de patata is a traditional tapa served in Spain either by itself, hot or cold or snugged between a piece of crusty bread rubbed with tomatoes, salt and olive oil (see pan tumaca). That’s right- I just busted out one of the few words I can say in Catalan, which happens to be my families native language. I can understand it and speak a word here or there, but I speak Castellano and not so much Catalan. Since I was a little girl, I can remember my favorite dinners with my mom: tortilla de patata, pan tumaca and some good green olives with a side salad. You may find one step of this recipe challenging, which is flipping the tortilla, but follow my fool-proof method and you can surely make this on your own. There are only 4 ingredients (and one is optional).

Slowly but surely the skin began to heal. I assumed Dove would never be able to grow feathers there again, but within 5 weeks she was mostly feathered out at the site. Three months later, except for a few purple feathers around her neck (Blu-Kote stains everything - so be careful!), you would never know anything had happened to her. We have found chickens to be a mix of strength and resiliency coupled with fragility. Fortunately for us, Dove fell on the side of strength. We ended up selling the main bird that had it out for Dove. We are now finally down to a happy mix of 14 hens of varying ages and varieties, and they all get along great.

Born on 15th October, 1844, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was an heir to a long line of Lutheran pastors – going back to the 17th century – who grew up in a staunchly religious household. His early years were marred by death, first that of his father, at the age of four, and later his younger brother. His formative period was defined by matriarchal domesticity and an admiration for Richard Wagner, his early 20s spent immersed in philology and theology at the University of Boon, and his middle-life dedicated to the relentless study which made him into a philosopher of matchless originality at once approachable and provocative. He was a writer by turns endearing, maddening and challenging but always and consistently compelling and complex. Even when his work appears straightforward, Nietzsche is at his most subtle and poignant, most wry and exciting, as he points out to the reader in The Genealogy of Morality almost facetiously: “I did say I would speak crudely: which does not in any way signify a desire for it to be heard crudely, understood crudely.” And perhaps therein lays the problem which has divided academics and critics’ alike, propelling a negative consensus through misunderstanding which has led to a classifying of Nietzsche as a nihilistic sybarite and a scholastic dilettante. But as Robert Wicks points out, in his book on this most prolific 19th century thinker: “Nietzsche loved to celebrate life, but he frequently had a very difficult time celebrating humanity.” In his guide Nietzsche, published by the Oxford-based One World press, Wicks gives an impressively comprehensive overview of Nietzsche’s ideas, the premises that underpinned them, and the academic, cultural and classic figures that influenced him.

I stopped them in the aisle because they looked like they knew what they were doing, and I was clueless and wanted more info on heat embossing. They told me all about it: that if I didn't want to buy a heat gun I could go home and try it out over the toaster...and then they gave me their phone number and an invitation to join them at their stamping get-togethers on Tuesday nights.
These are some things that it’s essential to answer and uncover to determine if your online business opportunity can compete within the market. Putting up an enterprise would require cash and a whole lot of your time as an entrepreneur. So before you start anything, you should take a hard, good, and lengthy look at your business ideas.
On the winding mountain roads outside of Virgin River, she gets a flat tyre and although she can change a tyre herself, the lug nuts are done up far too tight for her. She flags down some motorcycle riders and they all stop to help her. Katie’s eye is drawn by the handsome Dylan whom she immediately recognises as a former TV child star. To Katie’s surprise (and Dylan’s) they happen to run into each other again, in Virgin River. Dylan and his fellow riders are camping there for a few days, doing a little bit of sightseeing on the beautiful roads nearby and a lot of eating Preacher’s delicious foods.

Odell Footprint - I confirmed with Odell that Kansas City is due for our shipment of Footprint in early April.

Measuring omega 3s in canned salmon is not an exact science, however. All cans are not the same, and when declaring omega 3s, companies often rely on a government average. But the 3s will vary from fish to fish, depending on what rivers they’re from, the water temperature and depth, the season/month they’re caught and what they eat.

As Wario, go alfresco to the Boo-infested courtyard. Position yourself so that a Boo is amid you and the rabbit. Run and dive for the rabbit. As you do, the Boo will coalesce and assault you abroad while you bolt the rabbit. Afresh airing aback to the rabbit. It will not move, but it is now untouchable, like a Boo if it transparent. This can aswell get funny screenshots if Wario stands central the rabbit, which makes it attending like Wario has aerial ears.
Shortly afterwards, the Centre for Research on Globalization website posted an article written by Wayne Madsen. Mr. Madsen claims that a highly confidential official report has been circulating among senior members of the US Congress and their top advisors. The report has been allegedly nicknamed as the "C & R document". The author stipulates that those letters stand for none other than "conflict" and "revolution" because those scenarios are supposedly regarded by America's policymakers as plausible consequences triggered by a financial meltdown. According to Mr. Madsen, the content of the document reveals that severe financial chaos could spark a major war if Washington refuses to honor its foreign debt and/or massive riots in US cities if the American population does not accept a considerable tax increase.

Things went pretty fast from there. I registered, picked up my swag bag, and got into my dorm. The bags were HUGE. Filled with coupons, books, peppermills, cookies, bars, snacks, and so much more. Plus, the dorms had an extra toiletry gift bag with soaps, toothpaste, condoms, etc. I quickly changed and met up with Ben before heading over to the reception.
The film started from a very small idea. I had an experience when I was in Argentina with my thesis film, ‘Analog Days’. While I was there I had a romance with a girl who only spoke Spanish and I only spoke English so we had this crazy time trying to communicate, without language. This made me realize who much language connects us and makes us feel a part of the world. I could remember when I was there and everyone was speaking a language around me that I didn’t understand and how out-of-place that made me feel. It made me start thinking about what it must be like for people to come to the US when they don’t speak English and how hard it must be to assimilate.

Smith, a repeat offender, was suspected of involvement in a July 2006 home invasion and kidnapping. When three of the suspects took one of the hostages to another home, Smith allegedly remained behind to guard two small children, who had been bound and gagged. While there, the suspect helped himself to a soda, apparently unaware that by doing so he would leave behind potentially incriminating DNA evidence.

For instance, it’s interesting to know that someone could get arrested for vagrancy, but it’s more impactful to hear the story of what happens to a person who is arrested for such a frivolous charge and what happens to them. Then it’s even more unsettling when you get the numbers of how many people had this happen to them. Then you get to see the direct impact on the society as a whole. Then you go back to the personal story of the white people who got money for selling people into convict leasing.
I want to introduce what may be new phrase to you: ‘proof texting’. Though the phrase may be new to you, the concept isn’t a new one, it’s been around forever. ‘Proof texting’ is when a preacher wants to prove his point using the bible. So he searches scripture and finds one that he feels can be used regardless of the context or topic, the Holy Spirit originally intended. I always called this ‘scripture twisting’.

So I got up the nerve and applied to go to BYU-I for the Fall 2010 Semester as a part-time student. But wouldn't you know it, I was turned away until the Winter Semester because this is the largest semester of students in the history of the school and the school did not accept part-time students. I was told I could take an online class or a night class. So I opted for the online class. I am taking a Book of Mormon class and I know it has only been a week since the class started, but I LOVE IT!!!

He made a different choice, for his own reasons, and I cannot change that. I had second thoughts about sticking to my guns, and then took a long hot shower. I did some soul searching and came back to the point that I cannot stay in a relationship that has left me feeling so sad and angry and bad. If I were to stay, I would have to let a piece of me die, and that would lead to more of me being sacrificed every time he chose to stray. And then what? What is left at that point? Who am I and what do I become? Is there anything left to emotionally support my boys? My family? My friends?
I do wonder why some people have kids and then bitch about them. Tonight at the store I witnessed a mom with 3 kids bitching about her kids with the cashier. I really couldn't hear everything, I was in another lane, it just bothers me. I see so much bad parenting out there but to just complain about it to strangers????

Afterwards we went to my favorite restaurant, Cracker Barrel, and at the gift shop I got a few gifts for my mom: a big lollypop, two scented candles, a candy stick and a little bat beanie baby. Except for the candy stick, which was cotton-candy flavored, I picked things that sort of matched... The lollypop was orange, the candles Thanksgiving/Fall themed, and the bat beanie had Halloween colors. She liked everything.
Just a few weeks earlier I had felt so satisfied when I woke up sore and exhausted from moving in — all 15 boxes, all 6 flights of steps — by myself. At the time I had thought, smugly, about those friends of mine who required boyfriends for tasks like these, and I had pitied them.

He may stay at Pardes, learn in the Beit Midrash at Bar Ilan, spend some time at HaMivtar, or explore a yeshiva we don’t know about yet. Only time will tell how the specifics all shake down. He does have conditional acceptance to what seems to be a perfect fit for a rabbinical school, however we are always exploring the programs we may not have previously known about so that we can both make our dreams come true.

“ARE the iPads coming to 6th grade next year?” Has been an inquiry that has increased over the past several weeks as kids begin to realize that the year is coming to a close. They know the answer before they even ask it, but 10 and 11 year olds just can’t help themselves. Of course, the answer is, “They will be staying with me here in fifth grade.” And then their faces fall a little. Some of them console themselves by responding, “Well, at least I have one at home.” Or some of them are able to rise above the sadness and say, “Well, at least we had them this year.” It would not surprise me one bit if I had a few visitors next year just the see if the iPads are being used.

Exclusive licences commonly contain a yearly minimum royalty provision representing the yearly guaranteed earnings for the licensor. Such provisions are, however, not uncommon in nonexclusive agreements. The parties generally set the minimum’s based on a conservative estimate of projected net sales over the life of the agreement. The licensee should be careful when accepting a minimum royalty provision as this could represent a relatively heavy financial burden if there are of delays in start-up of production. Otherwise, the licensee should negotiate for minimum’s to start after an initial commercialization period and then increase gradually (for five or so years) up to an agreed-on amount that generally remains in effect for the life of the agreement.
‘Since developing the Scott Prize to promote and support debut short story writers, I have read and selected winners from hundreds of manuscripts. This year my task was made particularly difficult by the astonishing level of skill within our shortlist and I would recommend everyone to spend time discovering those writers. Making selections from the shortlist has been difficult but I have focused on the books which I believe have a depth and maturity of talent that all readers will immediately recognise. Carys Bray and Rob Roensch combine impeccable craft with unforgettable imagery to create stories that are surprising, psychologically resonant, emotionally complex and, above all else, a sheer joy to read. Carys and Rob, on either side of the Atlantic, both demonstrate that the short story is thriving and developing in the 21st century and I look forward to working with the writers and publishing their books later this year.’ The other shortlisted authors were:

Once my first little plant, lettuce I think it was, came through, I felt like I had mastered gardening, bought about 10 more garden starter kits and went veggie crazy. My current list includes: Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce (bibb, romaine, and that purple stuff), potatoes, green onions, radishes, peas, beans, acorn squash, zucchini, collard greens, white onions, spinach, carrots, cilantro, dill, basil, parsley, and probably a few more I just can’t remember.

The Prius is a Japanese invention, and you can understand why. You cannot enter a town that does not contain a Prius. Every Japanese car commercial I’ve seen for the last 4 weeks have all been for hybrid cars. As a tiny environmentalist myself I am so happy to see so many Hybrids, but also extremely surprised. It also seems like the cause is not just economy, but bling. Driving a car that says “Hybrid” on the back is very cool, and being able to say that you worry about the future, is also very Japanese. It’s quite admirable, really.

* I would add that instrumental understanding is advantageous for relational understanding. Being able to instrumentally understand a particular topic would benefit the learner when trying to reach the goal of relational understanding. A mathematics teacher could use the mold of procedures, and with the proper questioning of students about those procedures, to encourage students to think deeply about “why?” This will bring students closer to understanding important concepts, so they can ultimately reach relational understanding.
The gooey sticky filling was divine, faintly coarse from the nuts, creamy from the divine chestnut puree (I adore this stuff) and the cinnamon and sultanas adding little burst of fruity stickiness when bitten into. It tasted a bit like the filling for a praline chocolate, just fabulous! The small amount of cocoa didn’t add much to the flavour, but ensured a dark filling, helping to create the striking swirl effect within each slice.
It had been three years since I last saw my sister. Our lives have taken us 3000 miles apart and in very different directions. I was excited and nervous at the same time but I hoped it would be a healing experience. Our communication had been limited and the distance between us felt more like a million miles. We have always gotten along. As children, she was a better sister to me than I was to her. I was overly parentalized at home and bullied at school which made me critical and bossy. I teased her sometimes and excluded her from my friends. Although she has more of an explosive temper than I do, she has never said an unkind word to me. As a child I doubt that she ever took a cookie without also getting one for me. I thought of all these things as i made my way to my mother’s house to see her. I wondered to myself if i had contributed to her inability to move forward or her self-destructive tendencies. I was hoping for a heart to heart discussion to clear the air and rid myself of the guilt I felt. I suppose I was looking for a way to make sense of it, even if I had to scapegoat myself.
And I like the color coordination, but with the dark cabinets and the dark floor and the dark backsplash (and I'm thinking a similar blue-gray on the ceiling), something's gotta be light so I made it my counters. My sister has quartz counters and loves them so I went with the same. The color of these is called champagne, which is my favorite type of wine. They're made to resemble marble and actually have bits of marble in them. They also have bits of gold, which pulls in the copper hood. And then the sandy color is enough of a contrast to chrome and white.

Similarly, the Singapore Exchange’s approach to Australia’s ASX was rebuffed earlier this year….but you’ll find plenty of the MoU’s who think the Aussies should’ve gone ahead. However, not many of them are Australian. The fact is that, with DB and Euronext, TMS and the LSE, and Singapore and the ASX, nationalism showed that it is still a potent force. In fact, it is the only force standing in the way of consolidation. Market forces may yet prove to be stronger….and meanwhile, little you and me are, as usual, nowhere except unconsulted.

I don’t think reading is fundamentally different today.

What I emphasized to the broader group of congressional leaders yesterday is now is the time to deal with these issues. If not now, when? I’ve been hearing from my Republican friends for quite some time that it is a moral imperative for us to tackle our debt and our deficits in a serious way. I’ve been hearing from them that this is one of the things that’s creating uncertainty and holding back investment on the part of the business community. And so what I’ve said to them is, let’s go. And it is possible for us to construct a package that would be balanced, would share sacrifice, would involve both parties taking on their sacred cows, would involved some meaningful changes to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid that would preserve the integrity of the programs and keep our sacred trust with our seniors, but make sure those programs were there for not just this generation but for the next generation; that it is possible for us to bring in revenues in a way that does not impede our current recovery, but is fair and balanced.

As we left yesterday afternoon, we knew he wouldn't last more than a couple of days. I whispered in his ear, "Dad, we love you. We'll miss you, but we'll be fine. If you're ready to go, you go. Be at peace." Sounds just like the lovely little speeches you hear in the movies, doesn't it? But it was probably more for me than him, since the earbuds were still in place. Anyway, he was ready. A hospice volunteer was sitting with him during the night; nobody thought there was any need to summon Kay from the apartment downstairs. At a few minutes before 2 a.m., Dad's roommate woke up and sauntered over to say a few words. A nurse checked in. Moments later, the volunteer saw that Dad had stopped breathing. (We know this because that wonderful volunteer actually came back this afternoon to tell our family about those last moments, to reassure Kay that her husband had slept away and had not been alone. Thank you, hospice volunteers.)

What has made that façade so important in current U.S. capitalist consciousness, false or not, is the widespread distribution of real property in the U.S. population. Granted, this was the result of calculated state policy and was of enormous benefit to the FIRE (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) industrial grouping; but an effect of this widespread landownership has been to make common law property rights far more widely distributed over many different income levels than in any previous historic period.

Have my enemies reached me at last? I should have heeded the crows’ warnings. I praise my Christian God that I have seen the light, having left behind the paganism of Rome. Having written this, I know that they shall come for me very soon for having broken Roman law and yet…’

With exhibitions such as the Warehouse for the World, Electricity Gallery, Manchester Science Gallery, Textiles Gallery and Revolution Manchester, the Great Western Warehouse and the 1830 Warehouse show how Manchester emerged as the world’s first industrial city. The Power Hall showcases the machinery of the Industrial Revolution with its working steam, gas, oil, hot air and diesel engines. The Station Building still stands as the world’s oldest surviving passenger railway, with a portion of the tracks outdoors allowing visitors to take a train ride behind a replica steam locomotive. Visitors can also explore air, road and land transport in the Air & Space Hall.

Armed with those definitions, let me walk you through recent discoveries with memory research. In about a dozen studies (but most recently in this one by Benno Roozendaal et al), it has been shown that when we have a traumatic event in our lives, the body produces major amounts of glucocorticoids. This helps to calm us down so we can cope. It also gives us that “numb” feeling that many people describe during stress. But glucocorticoids have a transverse effect. They destroy neurons in the Hippocampus. This means that the more stress we are under, the less we will be able to store the traumatic event it in long-term memory. This partially explains how some people who endured years of trauma through abuse have very little memory of the entire season of events.

This law is not about vigilantism, which by the way is what some of the extreme reactions to the Florida incident may amount to, since the goal of a vigilante is to seek retribution after the fact for himself or on behalf of someone else. This law simply provides for a clear and present choice. Law abiding citizens, when brought face to face with a crime, can turn tail, run for their lives and accept their fate as the intended victim of a crime or they can choose to stand their ground and defend themselves by meeting threat with threat and force with force. I am in support of this law as I believe that as a free society we should have laws that give you the right, if you so choose, not to run and hide from the criminals.
“Epically awesome!” These are the words that were spoken by my son’s friend, Dan, as we were carpooling to school recently. We had just passed a car that was warming up in the cold morning. It had steam coming out of two exhaust pipes. I agreed that it was somewhat interesting because the steam was billowing out of two exhaust pipes and not just one. But “epically awesome?” Come on! I argued that in order for something to be epic, it had to be much more special and better than exhaust fumes pouring from a car. But Dan stood his ground. He would not give an inch. He maintained that it was “epically awesome.”

Most English bibles today start with the phase “In the Beginning, God created Heaven and Earth…”. This is a limited statement of limitation. The reason this is limited is because we have been given the original Hebrew as “breshit bara elohim shamayim eretz”. Literally, that translates to “beginning created gods, heavens, earth” which without proper context or comprehension is both bad English and non-sensical. What is in question here boils down to the first letter of Genesis, which as we have been given it starts with the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Bet. It has been a matter of great controversy why, when gematrically, the order of letters and verses is of great importance, Genesis starts not with Aleph the first letter but Bet, the second. Rather then engage in this argument, a solution presents itself if we correct this by placing Aleph in front of the Bet, purely as a logical and gematrically sound placement. Then, the Hebrew becomes “Ab-reshit bara elohim” which translates directly to “Father of the Beginning created the Gods”. Also, coincidentally, “Ab” (father) is the first word in Hebrew dictionaries. This now makes much more sense because now the first verse in Genesis can be translated as “The Father of the Beginning created the Gods, the Heavens, and the Earth. It is important to note that “Gods” (elohim) means the first created beings, the creator gods; that “Heavens” (shamayim) means all the higher spiritual realities, and “Earth” (eretz) means the dry lands, the solid physical universe, our level of reality. It is also given to comprehend here that the elohim, the shamayim and the eretz are created together simultaneously. The fundamental principal here is to distinguish between the creator, who exists before time, outside of time, independent of time; and the created.

Over the past several months I've been discovering that I have another major kink in addition to spanking, and that is Ageplay. I suppose I've been somewhat debating with myself whether to bring ageplay topics into my blog or not, but I think I will because I'm learning that it is such a big part of who I am. So you will be seeing some ageplay themed topics and experiences in my blogging future. There are so many different aspects to this kink and people experience it in so many different ways, so in the near future I will do an entry on what it means to me, what age I seem to settle into, and other tidbits.
I have this terrible irrational hatred of doing this, and find myself hoping I get fired or laid off or get into a horrible car accident so I don't have to.
“At some Ivy League schools last year, up to half of the graduates went into finance or consulting, a move that could have a profound effect on the economy in the years to come.” Crum, any civilization that does this to itself deserves what will happen next. The very brightest, who do NOT fall for this trap will simply leave the country. A genuine “brain drain.” Leaving the finance twits in charge of a society that explores nothing, invents nothing, produces nothing except paper
I didn't see anyone, old or young, wearing a bike helmet the entire time we were in Holland. The laws there are very strictly in favour of the biker. In all cases the law says that if a vehicle is involved in an accident with a bike, it is ALWAYS the vehicle's fault for insurance purposes. Thus, drivers in Holland are extremely careful of the masses of bicycles around them. Also, there are numerous safe biking paths everywhere. We found that it's the pedestrians, who share the narrow streets with the bikes, who need to be especially careful. The first few days it was quite daunting. I clutched Ariana to me tightly at every step. Later, though, we became more comfortable and learned to nimbly and swiftly step out of the path of passing bicycles without a second thought.
It's been a veeerrry quiet week.

Most pregnant women experience some sort of stomach discomfort at the beginning of their pregnancy. This usually stops at around 3-4 months; but may go on throughout the pregnancy. It may be present in the morning, or all day long. It can be triggered by certain odors or movement or have no trigger at all.
You’ve also got to find balance in your story. Just as you can’t have everything coming out roses for your characters, it can’t all come out as stinkweed and carnivorous plants either. Your characters need a rest while you prepare to bring the pain again, otherwise you’ve gone in the opposite direction. Certain failure. Frodo trips on the door sill on his way out of Bag End right into the arms of a waiting Nazgul. Game Over. That’s no good either.
After moving back home from my dorm this week, I have been trying to organize my room. I decided to paint my plastic storage containers to add more color to my room and also so I can store my underwear and things I don't really want everyone to see. (I don't have a dresser in my room at home) Right now it looks like a tornado went through my room. In between painting, I attempted to clean/organize. I haven't gotten very far yet.

I'm guessing this is Alder Creek but it could be Bishop Creek which is just up the road towards the valley from Alder. Both go under hwy 41. I'd often stop by an photograph these two creeks on my way back from giving a tour in Yosemite. I took a lot of this one but can't quite remember which creek it was. My best guess is Alder. Both are very similar but Alder is a little bigger.
I do have to note, however, that black and white neighborhoods distinguish themselves in one essential characteristic: Whites overwhelmingly oppose crime and gangs, white blacks overwhelmingly support them, in every way (e.g., “Don’t snitch”).
Hook into the mriga masu ko tarkari, a tender deer-meat curry ($19.95), fragrant with fenugreek, cumin cinnamon and coriander.

I figured I’d do something to commemorate the big day (other than break out my best cosplay, which I can guarantee nobody wants to see.) Susie Lindau just came up with a great idea for fellow bloggers to get to know one another, and I have to say I’m kind of borrowing her idea. However, this one has a superhero twist.

The rows between Andy and Danny – their relationship had always been slightly on the edge of mutual dislike – had turned into something of a daily occurrence, and jealousy within the band had started to rock relationships even more when Cal had bagged a modelling contract for a trendy jeans company.

Far beside the fact that I think finding and growing your own food is a MUCH better way to do things than buying stuff from a supermarket, I just find it immensely fun. I'll gleefully dance around outside, gathering yummy food, and have been more involved so far this year in gardening than I've ever been before. I love cooking, and I find I also really, really love being part of the growing and/or finding process in the food that I cook. I'm looking forward to many gardening and foraging adventures this summer...
At times I think there may even be a secret society of wait staff, plotting the take over of the world, belittling one table at a time. I read somewhere that a foreign exchange student had a 6month bout of depression because he felt inferior. Who made him feel so small you ask? Who would be so cruel? Who else? The wait staff. How is this possible?? You're wondering, let me give you a little insight into their thought process at various stages in your dining experience:
When they came in, they sat in the back of the room. The entire time I kept thinking to myself how badly I wanted to go talk to them and hear their story because Heath and I very much so have envisioned are family similar to what we were seeing.

This, however, is a total Pioneer Woman creation. Hardly surprising that it was awesome x1000. I used beef instead of pork, because that’s what I had. Funny that I’ll go to the store specifically to buy a bottle of Dr. Pepper, but I won’t go to the store specifically to buy a pork shoulder. I try not to explain myself. It’s complicated.

But right now, they are 12, 12 and 10 1/2. And they are fun. (Please remind me that I said this tomorrow when the most hormonal one is crying hysterically because her favorite pants aren't clean.)

After grandcharging, Sat relents and allows Sita back at the school…. Ironically, head of the PTA, Mootoo, complaining that no one thinking of the children. And you have to stop and ask yourself…if there is a court order, that has blocked the transfer and basically means Sita has to remain as principal of the school for now…who being more foolish and obstructionist? Not the Maha Sabha Education Board? Who going to the media with press releases everytime? Sita or Sat? I am wondering if the two main men on this board even see how dumb they look everytime they decide to buck the legal system? Why does Sat think the laws don’t apply to him? What he partners Devant and Tim have to say on this boy? Or are they in support of his behaviour?
Grameen Foundation has been working for 14 years to advance a certain approach to microfinance – one that is rooted in the experiences, achievements and philosophy of Grameen Bank. Though we do not promote any particular methodology (i.e., a certain means of providing financial or human development services to the poor), we do focus on and try to advance a set of principles and standards. Methodologies are very context-specific, while principles endure and standards are universal. (We approach our technology-for-development work similarly, but that is beyond the scope of this short post.)

Believe it or not, I am an optimist. I see the good in most things, I hope for the best, but I'm also not a blind idealist.
Then we talked ourselves out of it. See, smart investors know that maximum leverage is the key to building wealth. If we cash out now, the building wealth part will slow. The smart thing for us to be contemplating is to sell this block and buy a bigger block, such as an eightplex and building equity and appreciation there. We talked ourselves out of that too though because it's a lot of work and it's better to appreciate what you have than go jumping into the unknown. There's some big expenses coming up here in the next few years, some masonry work, the roof and a little basement leakage problem that isn't bad yet, but surely will worsen. I'd love to avoid those, but similar expenses are inherent in any building. The shiny new condo with no tenants and no repairs to be made sure sounds great, but in the end, I think we are making the adult choice.
After letting the onions cool slightly, I combined them with a mixture of eggs and half-and-half, and then poured them into my baked tart shell. The final step was topping the whole thing with the crispy bacon (what was left of the bacon, that is).

We have spent the weekend running local errands and recovering from either a cold or the worst allergy attack ever.

About a year ago, it was suggested to me by my supervisor at Staff Development for Educators (SDE) that I try to develop some STEM projects for my class and try to include them in some of the sessions that I present at their conferences. (For a complete list of my upcoming presentations, please click here!) My first thought was, “Uh... why would I want to teach about stem cells in Kindergarten?” And then my next question was, “What is STEM?” (Unfortunately, this only revealed my own ignorance in the subject, LOL!) For those of you that are still in the dark regarding this topic like I was, the term “STEM” in relation to edu-speak refers to projects that integrate all four of these subjects: science, technology, engineering, and math. Hence the term, STEM! So for the purpose of this blog post, this discussion has NOTHING to do with stem cells at all, thankfully! And as far as the “engineering” part of it is concerned, all the children have to do is simply build something. SO..., in this project, they would need to use the scientific method, and perhaps hypothesize, predict, conclude, etc. They would need to use technology in it somehow, such as a camera, iPad, document camera, etc. They would need to build something, or try to “invent” something. And then they would need to use their math skills somehow, by counting, estimating, sorting, dividing (sharing equally), etc. According to SDE, there is grant money out there for teachers that create STEM projects! Hmm, very interesting!!! Now I just need to figure out where to apply for it!!!!

Mars, which was later played over the show’s closing credits. Critically derided for its low budget, wooden acting, wobbly sets and ridiculously melodramatic scripts, the show originally began in 1964 and ran until 1988; it was revived in 2001 but the revamped show lasted just two years before being axed for a second time. Kathy joined the cast in 1978 and stayed until the end of its original run; she also turned up in the revamped version but soon left, unhappy with the sexy storylines. Incidentally, the opening exterior scenes used during the early 80s were filmed just a couple of miles from my childhood home.
