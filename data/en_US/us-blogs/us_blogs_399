When I first wrote my blog post about starting a brewery, I knew deep down that I could do it. However, I wasn't sure if I would really ever get if off the ground. I knew it was going to be a lot of hard work. And I was worried about the people who would doubt me and dismiss the idea. How was I going to pull it off? Many others have tried and failed. I didn't want to be one of those people.
I was ready to end my ride into “the country” and go back to my condo and my computer.

I got my Pinterest account this week, and so far, it's pretty stereotypical. I've re-pinned Lilly Pulitzer prints and Better Homes and Gardens pictures; I've posted comic strips and sassy sayings. And the more I'm using it, the better I'm liking it. There are spammers, and I want more followers, but that's fairly typical growing pains for any social media site.
My favorite place to go to brunch is The Uptown Kitchen in Heritage Square, Granger. I always go off the strict Paleo wagon in order to experience the gluten free pancakes they are serving that day. They have a gluten free chef that does an awesome job; however, she bakes/cooks most of her stuff with rice flour. If you have been to my nutrition class, you know that rice is a ‘tweener’ in my Paleo guidelines because while it is a grain, white rice has no antinutrient component and is free of gluten. So…..that equals acceptable indulgence for those that do not need to lose weight. If you are suffering from excessive weight, blood sugar regulation issues, or an autoimmune disorder, rice flour is still a definite ‘NO’!
In Limpopo province, students started the school year in January without textbooks even though millions of dollars had been allocated for purchases, with media reports saying a politically connected figure may have pocketed the funds.
Fear gripped her. Her hands lashed out, finding crinkly – was it latex? – sheets covering a variety of sludgy textures, as if someone had poured a mixture of plaster of Paris, quick setting concrete and sponge cake mix into a water bed, but no handbag. This wasn’t good. Time to open eyes yet? Maybe not.

I've been working on my hallway doors on and off for the past couple of weeks. The doors are a fairly soft pine. Never been painted. They have an almost black stain. The doors suffered from benign neglect and the finish had all but disappeared. The wood itself just looked dry. And of course, there were the paint drips....all those tiny paint drips.

Although only one of the films he stars in appears on my list, Vincent Gallo both surprised and disappointed in one of the best films I saw this year and one of the worst I suffered through. The first (and an outstanding rare film on my list) is ESSENTIAL KILLING (Poland/Norway/Ireland/Hungary, 2010), directed by Jerzy Skolimowksi. It screened at the PFA on August 20th, at 9pm. Read Skolimowski's comments about the inspiration for making this film (and perhaps why it doesn't screen with much frequency) here. In TROUBLE EVERY DAY (part of the UNDER THE SKIN: THE FILMS OF CLAIRE DENIS, which ran from March 4-April 16) Gallo had to talk and act at the same time, not something he did well in 2001. Both ESSENTIAL KILLING and TROUBLE EVERY DAY were provocative, shocking, gritty, and memorable. I think the reason Gallo was superb in ESSENTIAL KILLING is because he acted without speaking much. A film without dialog is a film that works well for Gallo. The wordless script didn't only benefit Gallo's portrayal of Mohammed, but also was in keeping with the silenced, desperate prisoner on the run in a strange place. Mohammed's ability to communicate, muffled by snow, anomie, confusion, and starvation, in this timely and politically astute piece of humanist drama was whittled down to the narrow features of Gallo's roaming eyes and gnashing teeth. Not unfamiliar territory for Skolimowski, who also chose to have his supporting actress, Emmanuelle Seigner, play a mute woman, silent cinema makes up much of Skolimowski's student films.

The electric total artificial heart was designed for permanent use and was completely implantable. Pneumatic total artificial hearts have not proved to be successful in small group studies. The Jarvik-7-100 artificial heart, a pneumatic system developed by the physician-engineer, Robert Jarvik, was tested in four patients as a permanent implant. All four patients died because of infectious, hematologic, and thromboembolic complications. One patient lived for 20 months. This device was first use by Dr. William DeVries who implanted the device in Barney Clarke in 1982.
According to the new "Crime in Texas Annual Report 2010" (pdf) from the Department of Public Safety, "this is the first time since 2000 that all seven index crime rates declined during the same year. Murder was down 7.4%, rape 9.2%, robbery 14.9%, aggravated assault 4.9%, burglary 5.9%, larceny/theft 4.9% and motor vehicle theft 12.3%." Overall, violent crime declined 8.3% and property crimes were down 5.7%.

A big problem in martial arts is as you learn more and more complex sets of skills that build on each other, you hit a wall and try as you might you just can't learn the next set. The problem isn't that the next set of skills is any harder to learn, but any flaws in your basic skills are amplified so much that they drag you down.
I forget exactly where I read that perhaps the reasons why medieval (ie: Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones) and ancient Roman (ie: Spartacus, Rome) dramas have appealed so much to the mass psyche these days is that these periods represent times in which which action, loyalties, and traditional family structures (though not contemporary sexual structures!) were relatively transparent, as opposed today, a period in which capitalism’s hall of mirrors makes it impossible to know what sort of actions have what consequences, what different social roles mean, etc.
My honeymoon was fabulous. I mean truly wonderful. As rough and ready world travelers, we sought the exotic. We knew we had the chops; we met as travelers in the mountains of northern Israel (our first "date" was two weeks in northern Egypt along the waters of the Red Sea). Little did I know we would traipse through Paris, see the Southern Cross descend upon a Saharan night sky and dance on stage in London with my favorite band.
Once upon a time, superstitions and rituals were the sole preserve of reactionaries, professional athletes, the alienated, children, and those suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. These days, however, it seems like everyone is aware of how little control they have over their lives and consequently feels the need to propitiate the gods of Fate and Fortune in whatever way seems to work. We here at Modern Astrology asked you, our readers, to tell us what methods you use to reclaim a sense of hope for the future and control over your destiny. And boy! did you have some ideas. Here, then, are your superstitions for the 21st century. Try them out, experiment, modify, report back. Remember: We rely on you to keep superstition scientific!

I’ve been doing this “experiment” for the past month where I have tried to follow a vegetarian diet, just to see how it would be. There are certain obstacles that prevent me from becoming a “full” vegetarian, which mainly are in the form of my family. The other members of my family are meat eaters, so it becomes difficult to adhere to vegetarianism when I go home for a visit. My boyfriend and his family are also meat eaters. (His family raises chickens, turkeys, ducks, pigs and cows, which all eventually end up as food.) I think they would probably take it a little easier than my family would, but they would still probably be puzzled and possibly offended. My own parents would probably ask me what was wrong with me and be worried that I’m not getting enough nutrition.
Although that doesn’t square with me laughing at myself. Or maybe it does. But yesterday evening I had to laugh at the near neighbor, and he caught me watching and laughing; well, smiling, looking his way.

The gig started with Bev, decked out as a vestal virgin with flowers in her hair, walking down the aisle of the beautiful church - St Sepulchre is the musicians' church in the City in the same way that St Bride's is the journalists' church - which was decorated for Christmas, carrying her fiddle and singing She Moved Through the Fair. She was eventually joined by six other maidens - though I use the term advisedly - with long hair and costumes fastened under the bust a la popular representations of Morgan Le Fay. And though it never got that folky again the scene was set for a certain level of theatricality.
Now what about concerns of mercury, PCBs and Dioxins in fish? In short, worries about those matters are needless. They do not pose a significant threat, and the health benefits of Omega-3s far outweigh any risks.

This particular quilt is based on a tile floor that she spotted at a chemist's shop (drugstore to us Yanks) in Ambleside. My friend, Louise, has actually been there and seen the floor in person. Pretty neat! The original floor, and Christine's quilt, are in terra cotta, browns, and golds.
Plenty of mistakes have been made since 2010, but this has nevertheless been the best government for a generation, led by men and women for the most part of decency and goodwill. Important steps have been taken towards addressing the financial deficit, while the reforms to welfare and education are essential to the health of Britain as a nation and will soon be irreversible… It is only thanks to the skill and admirable personal forbearance of Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron that the project has lasted as long as it has.

Today we hired a car and driver and sightsaw our way around parts of the city. I hadn't realised it was as long as seven years since we were last here - its understandable that there have been some changes. Free wifi at the hotel for example - I didn't bring my iPad in the end but it would have been a good idea to. The roads are incredibly busy, more than ever - but thinking about it, it's the type of traffic that has changed. And I suspect that it indicates increased prosperity - very few bicycles nowadays and a huge number of motorbikes. Still the auto rickshaws of course but even they, though much the same in design, are more modern - newer, anyway - than they used to be. And I've only seen a single old Ambassador, the Indian Morris Oxford, the cars are all new.
Add veggies. Use whatever you like. I prefer potatoes, carrots, and onions. Dice them up and throw them right into your roasting pan with the chicken. They get all chicken-flavored and soft and delicious with lovely roasted edges. Mmmm. You can also season the bird with a little butter (optional) and some dried thyme. Because thyme is the tastiest herb known to man. It's fantastic on chicken... and just about everything else.

After the baking, Rachel sliced some of it up, and we fried a few pieces. They were toooooooo salty! Oh my, almost inedible. Turns out, five days was much too long to let the meat soak up the cure - probably because my pieces of meat were small (because we butchered a small hog).

People keep asking me why I’m still in this office and what I’m doing, well im working to inform people about the affect of the governments cuts and stressing out day after day to get myself heard. I tell people that it’s because I’d rather work to try and create a decent future, rather than let the government take control of everything that is good left in this country and rip it to pieces. My future, everyones future is at stake. We work on the anti-cuts campaign because we want the people in charge to get the message that they are wrong, it’s not ok, and yes you do have to leave number ten. The direct attack on the Arts, for example has become a genuine concern, the devaluation of arts and humanities is writhe in the air with funding cuts and slanderous propaganda, even Russell group universities deeming them to be an easy option as ‘soft subjects’ and therefore of less value. This attitude is both appalling and untrue with many humanities subjects showing the same level of difficulty as science and maths based causes, which are held in such high regard by the Russell Group.
The original recipe for these super delicious cheesecake squares called for a chocolate glaze but I did not want it to eclipse the dulce de leche flavor; after having one square I felt that omitting the glaze had been the right decision: the cheesecake tasted wonderful and very rich, it did not need any embellishments.

When I first started my studies here, unlike some of my colleagues I was thrilled to do coursework. It had been so long since I had been enrolled as a student and I began my studies conscious of how much I want and need to learn. And I was tired of setting my own syllabus. Thinking about this stage of my journey, past coursework, when I would write my own exam questions and set my own course of study to prepare for exams, was terrifying.

What does this have to do with my creative journal? Well while researching I saw a youtube video on ink blowing and I was intrigued. We have some ink laying around it got me thinking about what else you could do with ink. After several attempts ~ apparently a little goes a long way ~ I created my own ink blot.

I just figured it came naturally to all those “skinny” people. I didn’t realize that they had to suck wind to train their bodies to run just like I did.
This year I participated in such a conference; the GOTO conference in Aarhus, Denmark (the conference was formerly known as JAOO). Here the lineup of speakers was also heavily tilting towards men, but it is one of the conferences which actively tries to get female speakers, and they had managed to get some really great ones, including Linda Rising, Rebecca Parsons, and Telle Whitney.
The Prussian King was furious. He continued the description of his dream. He said that the struggle between the two stars had been long and forceful, but that his own star had escaped – with great difficulty – and taken its place again, continuing to shine in the sky, while the other one had disappeared. He wanted to know if his astrologer still thought that Prussia would be dominated.

There may be those who think that separatism is the most likely path for events to take. Can we not simply detach ourselves from our Muslim populations, letting them go their way while we go ours? One could envisage a population transfer in which Muslims and non-Muslims sorted themselves out in two geographically separate blocs. Might this not provide the best solution to our growing dilemma?

It's also the first movie to examine the after-effects of Vietnam.

After considerable debate, the Iredell County Commissioners voted last month to raise the property tax rate from .445 to .485. This increase was made necessary, to a great extent, by the 2011 property revaluation which, overall, decreased the cumulative value of property in the county and with it, the amount of taxes collected on that property. The North Carolina Association of County Commissioners (NCACC) reported that Iredell County now has the 21st lowest tax rate among North Carolina’s 100 counties, up from 17th in 2010.

One possible help to creating more downwash of the exhaust plume towards the beam wing is the use of the suspension elements. The wishbones, push rod and track rod are unsprung and not counted as bodywork. Although they should be considered aero neutral, they are allowed to point up or down 5-degrees. If these elements were placed in the exhausts flows path, they could deflect the exhaust plume downward. In particular the rear leg of the top wishbone, which is already widely used a flow control device sitting high up in line with the top of the wheel and rear axle, could be used to drive some flow downwards to the rear of the car. Clearly any suspension element whether it be made of composites or titanium would need heat shielding to protect it from the +800c gasses

The crowd had an air of Woodstock about it. The average age couldn't have been over 26, and they were all enthused, engaged and...well...very 1968. Long hair, loose clothes, tie-died T-shirts, frisbees, live bands playing protest songs, artists & poets mingling, old hippies, braless women, everyone talking of love and change, teenage parents with $8.34 between them playing with their kids. All that was missing was the smell of pot and a couple or two getting it on in a tent. It was almost surreal. I'm not a stranger to standing out in a crowd, but usually it's not because I'm the one who looks like the wealthy Republican plant.

I have also met the sweetest couple there at the facility where my husband is. There names are Frank and Dorothy. He has Alzheimer's although he seems to be doing well to me. Of course my opinion is compared to my own husband's dementia which is quite advanced. Frank and Dorothy have been married 67 years. I have the greatest admiration and respect for them. He calls Dorothy his girl and he loves her so. Of course she feels the same about him. She is so heartbroken over having to admit him there. I have found a dear friend in her and I so enjoy talking with her. She and Frank have had many more years of loving one another than Jim and I but she and I understand the heartbreak each of us feel.

I remember when I had it, too. When Liam was very, very little, I was adamant about having a no-violent-toys rule in our house. Truth is, I didn't think all that deeply about it. I was anti-gun, and I would not invite violence into my peaceful home. So, here we were living in the woods, no television, no violent toys, only natural stuff and music and all that. And, Liam goes outside, picks up a vaguely gun-shaped stick, points it, and says something like "pow." Where had he even *seen* a gun?? I had no idea, but I began to realize that I was messing with stuff that I maybe didn't understand. Then, Jimmy impressed upon me that he had guns to play with when he was a kid and he wasn't a violent criminal. Or a criminal. Or violent. I totally had to concede this point, and I relaxed about it.

Needless to say my time has been spent with family issues regarding my grandmother. There is no joy in Mudville right now. We have found another facility closer to my parents and will be moving her this week. To move the elderly is chancy at best but we have no choice.
When I first started sampling this batch I thought I had some diacetyl problems that might have been caused by using only one pack of, possibly old, yeast. Over time the buttery flavors seem to have worked their way out. Lesson learned. In my next batch I use 2 packs of yeast and get better results.
I've crossed some invisible boundary that I never saw coming and now find myself straddling just slightly over. I'm taking this all in, slowly, one day at a time, as is my spouse. We both love each other and are committed to see this through. I just don't seem to know anymore where I may be ultimately headed. Small steps may all that are needed to see more clearly.

So here is my theory on this beer, tell me what you think. On the bottle it's labeled as a "malt liquor" and is imported to Virginia. If you are a brewery in Austria and you are importing to the USA, you would want to save some money and print only one style of label. Certain states require beer above a certain ABV to be labeled as malt liquor instead of beer. Texas is not one of those states. So this beer is probably only available on east coast states that have the "malt liquor" label regulation. How's that theory?

Do I look like a pot-washing, message-taking, adorable duck!? I'm getting a bit fed up of it now, it used to mildly amusing but the novelty factor has worn off. I keep hearing people tell me how incrediby stressed I must be, and that this is an awfully big project to take on alone. I'm not under enough hot water to be stressed. Yet.
Pat: I’ve done the basic online work. I’ve posted about it on my blog, on Facebook, on Twitter. Some of my friends blogged about me and my e-book early on. I have an e-mail list of about 600 people, so I sent out e-mails to all of them. I got more active on Good Reads. There’s a link on my e-mail signature. Lots of little things, here and there. There’s more I could do, but time is always an issue.

When you can finally bring yourself to leave, and to be honest if I’d been there on my own I would probably have spent another hour in there just studying the intricacies of the building, you end up in the wand shop, where there is a mixture of the boxes from the film version of Ollivander’s, along with wands for every person who ever worked on the film series. There are also helpful staff who have memorised where the wands are so you can ask to see
Getting used to these keyboard short cuts can reduce your time spent on projects and you find that it’s just a easier way around.

I realised as I created this card for his birthday tomorrow that he is no longer a child and my card had to be more mature - gone are the says on Batman, Super Heroes and Lego - this card had to be suitable for a young man but still be fun - after all, he is still a teenager and I am in no way rushing him to grow up!

While the tickets for individuals were $300 -- $250 if you got 'em early -- the lineup was well worth the price. The scheduled performers included James Ingram, Patrice Rushen, Brenda Russell, Kevin Toney, Kathryn Bostic, Michael Lington, Carmen Lundy, Ndugu, Greg Phillinganes, Sylvester Rivers, and Billy Valentine. As if that wasn't enough, the UNSCHEDULED folks included the likes of Sheila E., Kat Dyson, Marcus Miller, Stephen Bishop, Dave Koz, and George Duke. In addition, we heard some of the Jackie Robinson Foundation's up and coming musicians.

My favourite luxury item by far was my Mazda MX-5. I was 23 and driving a Corolla (V reg automatic) which was great, but I wanted to trade it in while it was still worth a bit of money. My Dad convinced me to get a sports car while I was young and single, and never before (or since) has be spoken a better piece of advice.
Transaction occurs between a client and a server and comprises all messages from the first request sent from the client to the server up to a final (non-1xx) response sent from the server to the client. If the request is INVITE and the final response is a non-2xx, the transaction also includes an ACK to the response. The ACK for a 2xx response to an INVITE request is a separate transaction.

so, suddenly, i’m working part-time again (which means about nine hours a week and occasionally subbing for a few classes as well), which i haven’t done since i was fourteen (and the main reason was that it’s illegal for fourteen-year-olds to work full-time and even still, i was also babysitting on the side). and i’m telling you, i can’t even find the time to do ANYTHING and i’m EXHAUSTED when i get home. and to top it all off, i don’t even have any friends here, really, so i don’t even do much!

This man has been forced to deal with my own reckless choices.

For twelve hours we visited historic buildings, took tours, listened to the expert docents, and enjoyed the ambiance of the village. Then we ended the day with an excellent show called Cry Witch. It was a mock witch trial where we got to participate by deciding the innocence or guilt of the accused. Casia was thrilled when we got selected to sit as two of the twelve member council. We sat up with the judge and got the best seats in the house for this well acted performance.
The worst moments of a man’s life turned into the best as businessman David Graham turned to God. It began with debilitating panic attacks, but ended with healing and hope. A vision, a dream, and the words of the Holy Spirit brought this former pastor and counselor revelation that he was a valued son in a relationship with a loving Father. Graham shares principles for living in validation and significance, interspersed with scripture and his compelling experiences. For those seeking a sense of self-worth, and the identity found only in the ultimate Parent—God.

Somehow, it was drivable...so I just kept driving to Pepe's.
It is a disappointment that I have to go to the dashboard and hunt for the DLC there. I hate how game videos, demos, avatar items and DLC are all mixed together in the game marketplace. It’s hard to know what’s there that I actually need. I don’t care about those other items when I go looking for Game Add-Ons from the Marketplace. I was really hoping I could download and install DLC in game which is what the in game marketplace looked to be designed around. Maybe this will change once Turn 10 gets stuff sorted out better, but I’m not holding my breath.
Before entering, I paused and thought for a moment about the superior nutritional benefits which might accrue from ratting through yesterday’s left-overs in the KFC bins next door, but instead opted for something warmer and marginally less fetid and congealed.
Back to driving around the web looking for trouble.
As for when I started blogging, again I can't really remember. I started in 2009 just after I'd finished my art degree and think I was quite depressed. I didn't get the results I was hoping for and felt disappointed with myself and let down by my Tutor and I just didn't feel like painting much at that time. But I still needed an outlet for my creativity so wanted to start writing some sort of blog. Since starting to wear makeup I've always been creative with my looks (i.e. not particularly good at it) and loved buying and playing with it so thought it would be a good thing to concentrate on.
Honestly, the viewer must be able to actively submit to the paradigms of the tale and allow the quiet moments to be overwhelming. This can be an impediment to accessing the movie, but I think that it is also a virtue and part what makes his work so poignant and powerful.

I had run out of "e's" from the wood letter set and almost got more, but my scrapping friend Janet stopped me from buying more wood letters, saying, "Use an 'e' from your supplies." That have me the idea for the embellishing. I punched a star from scrap paper, traced around it, punched holes every 1/4 inch, then stitched.

Happy Monday and thanks for taking the time to visit the charmed life blog. We had a great weekend-how about you?? Yesterday we had some snow and it is continuing today.

4. The Vatican, for its part, seems to have nothing encouraging to say about independent bishops. One of the more common claims of Vatican recognition for the sacraments and orders of the Liberal Catholic Church, for instance – a supposed positive ruling by the Roman Congregation of Rites – has been exposed as a hoax. (See: “Rome and Liberal Catholic Orders,” by Rev. L. K. Langley at: www.lcc.cc/tlc/lxvi1/rome.htm) The Vatican’s stance appears to be that so-called valid orders are worthless without the Church’s recognition.

To help ourselves through this tough time we've been cosying up, eating simple comfort foods and I got out my long-neglected watercolours. Eldest and I painted together. The activities we are finding reassuring are the same as those that help in the depths of winter. We've been very grateful for our fire and cosy quilts in recent days.
The weather has been a bit colder since the calendar turned to August so it did not seem weird to eat a hot soup during the summer. But, even if it was hot I think I would still make this delicious, creamy chowder made of seasonal ingredients.

As for the future, earth’s fate in relationship to the sun is precarious. When it eventually enters its red giant phase (similar to adolescence in its trouble-making capacity), the sun will have a maximum radius beyond earth’s current orbit. This sounds bad but could be offset by the fact that the sun will have lost 30% of its mass due to stellar wind, and all the planets will have moved outward. “If it were only for this, earth would probably be spared,” notes Wikipedia hopefully. However, “new research suggests that earth will be swallowed by the sun owing to tidal interactions” and that, even if the earth could escape incineration in the sun, “still all its water will be boiled away and most of its atmosphere would escape into space.”
Yesterday I used the word “crowd-sourcing,” which seems to be a growing buzzword in digital humanities—especially when funding for traditional, in-house transcription projects is in jeopardy.
The evening was a great success and I think that most people enjoyed themselves, but as it was the first time that a meal had been attempted there were a few hiccups and teething troubles which will need to be ironed out for the future. One major omission was the absence of pepper and salt pots from the table. The takings from the evening will be brought round here sometime this week for husband, who is the village hall treasurer, to bank or to be more accurate he will do the paperwork and I do the actual banking. The proceeds from the evening will go towards the fund to build a new village hall, which is badly needed.

For some people, simply imagining how that person would react in a given situation is enough, but for me it isn't. Instead, I try to think of times before where I myself felt calm assertiveness. I think of writing, editing and publishing, which are all areas in which I feel very confident. I call forth that same strength in hectic times to ground myself.

I am reminded of Stephen in Acts 7:56 when he testified that he saw “the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God,” The reaction was similar to this account of the apostle Paul. He reported that he saw the Lord while in a trance in the temple. The mandate was for Paul to quickly leave Jerusalem for Israel was manifesting not mere unbelief but angry rebellion. He did leave only to return at this late date.

You are my rock. You are my strength. That might seem so cliche for me to say, but it's so true. You've made me realize what love is, and how so many things I thought I felt in the past was never anything to compare to what I have and feel now. I am so excited to become your wife today and to embark on this journey together. You were my first real true love and I'm so excited for all of the other "firsts" we have to come -- homes, trips, children. It's all so much to look forward to and I thank God every day for putting you in my life.
So back to the ugliness of my house. It is a one story ranch style, painted brick house from 1958. Luckily it is quite large, and has a high enough roofline we are going to finish the upstairs in a couple years. Not exactly the epitome of farmgirl style, that goes without saying. So, I have to inject a little cottage, a little charm and make it my own! (I will show you photos later...once it is done...because I am hoping it is going to be one heck of a change!)

Let the years pass unnoticed. Get a career, not a job. Buy a house. Have two striking children. Try to raise them well. Fail, frequently. Lapse into a bored indifference. Lapse into an indifferent sadness. Have a mid-life crisis. Grow old. Wonder at your lack of achievement. Feel sometimes contented, but mostly vacant and ethereal. Feel, during walks, as if you might never return, or as if you might blow away on the wind. Contract a terminal illness. Die, but only after you observe that the girl who didn’t read never made your heart oscillate with any significant passion, that no one will write the story of your lives, and that she will die, too, with only a mild and tempered regret that nothing ever came of her capacity to love.

I think that we're definitely seeing the "coming soon" fabric sneak peaks much earlier in the production process with a long wait for those of us who want to buy it retail. This can be a good thing and a bad thing, sometimes it feels like an eternity until we can get our hands on it! I'm loving the involvement of more men in the craft, as fabric designers, quilt makers and bloggers, they bring a different design aesthetic and create great products.

Howver they have been threatening to come and visit me for a long time and it would be a foolish person who did not have friends at this time and I have been encouraged by the response from local BNP activists who live minutes away from me.

And they're an absolute inspiration. All that they have now - several clients and an office on 35th street - is due to their ambition and love for what they do.

Gosh, doesn't their story just make you want to quit your job and start your own company?

“Deep in the rainforest of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, in the shadow of his ancestors' great stone pyramids, one of the last Mayan beekeepers guards an ancient secret. It was passed on to him directly from his fathers in the Mayan language from long before the time of Cortez. He is one of very few modern Maya upholding the beecraft skills of keeping stingless bees. All is unveiled as Emmy award-winning cinematographer Keith Brust (Planet Earth, etc.) takes us deep inside the bees' hidden world and this ages old Mayan tradition for the first time.

It is clear to the entire television audience that she is completely devoid from the reality of caring for premature infants. If you watched any of Ann Curry’s interviews with the McCaughey septuplets – you would see how many volunteers were needed just to care for them and there was a fully present, live-in, not just a sperm donor father and only one big sister. Those premies were not brought home to six children under seven. And the McCaughey’s had a wonderful support system in their town and church – something that selfish woman does not.

The novel is Poem for the Wolves and it’s different than Drift in several ways. It’s a science-fiction novel set in a very close future (2023), the writing style is more external than internal, and it’s much bigger in length (both story and page length). However, there are some key elements that remain the same. The biggest similarity is the fact that I try to make it very much human and heartfelt, especially towards the end.

WE AT THE DENVER NEWSPAPER GUILD consider ourselves partners with Denver Post management in the effort to position the newsroom and the company to thrive in the new media environment. However, we disagree in the strongest possible terms with the company’s decision to lay off two-thirds of the paper’s copy editors. We feel it is a shortsighted cost-cutting measure that will irreparably damage The Denver Post.

Nanni Moretti's father figure here seemed selfish, vapid and whiny - quite a feat considering how naturally charismatic Moretti normally is for us. But his ordeal is nebulous and ill-defined: a loved one has died, but he doesn't feel bad? He didn't love her and he feels guilty? She was crazy? No wait, his sister-in-law was crazy? …What?

I Did not like some of the changes they made and the shaky camera techniques make most of the movie a blur, however if you read the books(which you should because they are amazing) you can follow the movie better if than you have not.

We found the nicest place in Riverside, CA for my husband's Mom. It was wonderful! The food was really tasty. I used to go and have lunch with her as often as they would allow me to do so. Lots of fun activities and exercise. Really a beautiful campus. I want something like that for our Mom...
Either way, the number was half dialed, my finger resting on the final digit when I thought WTF and immediately hung up the phone. He did me no favours in the almost four years I worked at Cell Block C. He was Sybil in the male form and would go from giddy to gastrointestinal ass-hat in 60 seconds or less. He was a condescending, little snivelly twit who would run to mommy and daddy to complain about anyone and then would kiss ass in the next minute to get you back on his side. You can tell we had a love-hate relationship, and while we got along swimmingly for two years before the psychosis became too evident, our parting could not have come too soon.

They have a hotline in case you need it, and they have great customer service (but I have never had to use it because everything turned out great.) They even have a mailing list and often send out discount codes.
The state of Colorado has already sold the mineral rights to the ground beneath our feet, and they did so without a public vote, without a public hearing, and without a thorough study regarding the health, safety and environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing aka fracking. And now, they are telling us that we will be sued, by the state of Colorado, if we stand up for our right to determine what industrial activities take place within our own borders.
I am getting to help with some of the event planning for Day of Caring and the Palooza/Kickoff celebration on September 10th and 11th, which I love.

Go to United Way of Weld County and click on Day of Caring and come celebrate with us on Friday 9/10 in Lincoln Park, we will be having all sorts of food, fun, and information about Weld County non-profits and the United Way.

Where was I? Oh yes, here's my tip for all those idiots who are ready to rush out and spend perfectly good money on obesity drugs for your fat fucker dogs: stop feeding your dogs! I guarantee that they will lose weight, and if you only feed them intermittently they will really, really appreciate you when you start feeding them again. You can trust me on this one, as I have empirically tested it on my children for years. Now that I have published, my grant money should be coming through any time now.

I began talking to the young woman next to me. A very pretty lady in her mid 30’s. Wonderful complexion, beautiful black curly hair and big, big brown eyes. A picture of health. Seizing the opportunity to educate about PMP I began to tell her about this condition. How it starts, spreads, the fact that it’s symptoms in women are very similar to ovarian cancer (yes I’m doing it to you too now!) She responded by telling me about her cancer. Breast cancer. A cancer she’s lived with for ten years. Her story knocked me sideways. Not only did she have a cancer, it had spread throughout her body. She opened an attractive looking Filofax, except it wasn’t a Filofax it was a pill carrier. Trays, compartments filled with drugs. Each one to hold the cancer at bay, maybe to shrink it. I didn’t ask. I’m nosey but not insensitive, I try not to stick fingers into open wounds. As we talked she reached into her bag and produced a photo of her son. He is 11 years old. SNAP! We talked about our dreadful veins, our hospital experiences, particularly those relating to food. We laughed. I was aware that Francis was waiting for me outside in the waiting area and that he’d be worried. I gave him a quick text to tell him I was okay. How could I explain that I was laughing, having a good natter with someone with terminal cancer but that was exactly what I was doing. I wasn’t feeling sorry for myself, or her. No one was hugging us, no one was treating us differently. We weren’t busy being ‘inspirational’ or ‘brave’. We were just two women passing the time. Comparing our kids addictions to X boxes.

Ugh. I liked this movie much better when it was leaner, meaner, and called Swimming with Sharks. Despite a fun performance by Stanley Tucci (Can he be cast in every movie, ever? Thanks.), I found very little to recommend The Devil Wears Prada. The heroine is not worth rooting for, it’s neither terribly funny nor a bit romantic, and Streep’s lauded performance is little more than a fairly rote ice-queen number, despite the weak attempt to grant her a sliver of humanity in the third act.
We all love shopping, don't we? Especially Christmas Shopping!! Well, maybe sometimes not so much.

The outer shell of the corn kernel is made of cellulose, an indigestible fiber that harmlessly passes through our digestive system if not properly chewed. If you’re getting some confetti-coloured stool, perhaps you should take the hint that your mouth is not doing its fair share of the work. Munching your food properly is the first step in the process of digestion, which extracts the nutrients from what you eat. The bottom line is: the more you chew your food, the more nutrients will be available for your body to absorb. There’s no point in dropping extra cash on organic food, if you don’t even chew it up!

In other words, Rheticus’ work on Copernicus wasn’t singled out by the Index—rather, all of his works were proscribed. And the Index says explicitly why Rheticus's works were there and, lo and behold, it had absolutely nothing to do with heliocentrism, but rather was due to his connection with Protestant scholars. Now it seems hard to believe that Bob didn’t read the last half of that sentence. So why did he choose to omit it in Galileo Was Wrong or in this most recent discussion with me? Why would he continue to give the reader the impression that the works of Rheticus were put on the index because of their Copernican ideas and then go on to accuse me of dishonesty in supposedly suppressing information from the reader?

As I mentioned, there’ve been several sets of luggage since then. And we always tried to make sure the girls had their own suitcases too – initially, a tiny pink “Going to Grandma’s” suitcase that didn’t hold much more than a pair of pajamas, moving gradually to larger pieces. At one point, we bought a purple set and broke it up among the girls – the largest suitcase was big enough to hold the five-year-old and her clothes for a week, besides. In fact, that behemoth is still in service, as the Ottawa girl hauls it back and forth every time she comes home for a visit. It’s big enough for her clothes, her laundry, anything she’s bringing home to store, and the hedgehog wheel.
What do we learn from this? Well, sometimes you can do things in different ways to achieve the same result. Tomorrow I am going to be making the Poulet Basques that I posted a while back for Amy’s birthday dinner. We’re going to have several people over, and I am going to roast the chicken rather than cook it the way I described in my post. I’ll take some pictures when I am doing it so you can get an idea, and write it up too!

The cramping feeling started to feel more contraction-like around mid-afternoon but it still wasn't painful and I knew this kind of feeling could last for hours or days so at 6pm we went to the local Italian for dinner. I'd told my husband contractions were every ten minutes or so and got him to download an app on his IPhone as I was starting to get curious about the timings. We looked at the readings around half an hour later… 6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes… oh, maybe something was definitely happening! We came home and my Dad went to bed, his parting words "this baby isn't coming tonight".
Because there are voluminous topics which need exploration, I’m going to consider this particular posting to be a preview of what will be written in detail over the next few weeks. So, somewhat Larry King-style and in no particular order, a smattering of topics and my POV that will be covered:
However the Conde Ducque, whilst being a little traditional in style, turns out to be an excellent choice. It’s located on the edge of the Malasana district and only a half hour walk to any of the main attractions or locations in the city. The room is spacious enough and well-appointed but doesn’t have a kettle and tea and coffee. Why? Why do they do that! It drives me mad!
"As the Gallery marks its 71st anniversary, it is fitting that we introduce NGA Images and an accompanying open access policy, which underscore the Gallery's mission and national role in making its collection images and information available to scholars, educators, and the general public," said Earl A.

"In turn this supports research, teaching, and personal enrichment; promotes interdisciplinary research; and nurtures an appreciation of all that inspires great works of art."

This is not me! This insecurity, the feelings of inadequacy, the misfit-ness. This is the person who I was. Or, at least, who I thought I was. I don't know... And do I need to know? Why do all these feelings have to surface just because I'm about to see people I haven't seen in 30 years? People who mean nothing to me today?

The darkness consumes me. I feel nothing, nothing but pain and fear. Why should I rejoice in my God, why should I give Him praise? He has drawn away from His servant, His child, and when I needed Him most. Where is His light to guide me, or his hand to guide my path. I cry out to the Lord, but He is silent, why has he abandoned me so?

I did get back into DNN when the Professional Association for SQL Server (PASS) offered hosting to physical and virtual chapters. The CMS is DNN and therefore I use it regularly because Midlands PASS is hosted there. I was able to renew my old DNN skills and while the Midlands PASS site is pretty plain, it gets the job done. Joomla! has also come back into the picture. I’ve worked at a youth missions camp the last few years and because of work I won’t be able to actively help out this year. That’s a shame because I really love what the camp does. They really do go out into the community and help others. Their website is in Joomla! but they no longer had a webmaster because the old one can’t do the work anymore. When I helped out the camp’s journalism team at a crunch time last year (I was one of the few with Mac experience), I had to hit the website and help them get some things up and realized then it was Joomla! This year, when talking with the organizers, I noted that it hadn’t been updated and was told about the need for someone to manage the site. Because I had previously worked with Joomla!, I volunteered.
And onto debit card info… At first, we were going to go with USAA (one must be affiliated with the U.S. military to join USAA — many thanks to Mike’s dad for his service!) because they refund up to $15 in ATM fees each month and do not charge a fee for the first 10 withdraws. But then they charge after those limits. That didn’t really bother us because we didn’t think we’d go over those limits, but then we noticed the 1% foreign transaction fee that’s tacked on to all withdraws. Boooo USAA!
I can't live without E anymore. I have turned in three weeks what took six months to torn into last year. Someone I don't recognize, someone who I do not want to be.
The color reminds me very strongly of the crystal clear sea blue/green waters that you often see in the holiday brochures. The twinkling specks of gold look almost like the sunlight reflecting off the surface of the sea. Breathtakingly unreal. Definitely a color that mermaids will wear - they exist, don't they? ;)

Firstly, those people who leave because the guild isn’t giving them what they want are not a loss to the guild as long as you are running the guild to the ideals you originally set out. We accept that maybe some of our raiders aren’t going to make us the top guild on the server. We accept that people in our guild might not cap their Valor Points every week because they have families, jobs and other real life issues to deal with. We would rather have fun in a raid than have miserable raids with highly skilled players who have bad attitudes. If you have players who don’t like that and want the guild to change, then its a good thing when they leave because all that does is make people miserable. The Officers get tired of listening to ‘the hardcore progression player who constantly moans’ because thats not the kind of player the guild is set up to embrace. If it was a hardcore guild, the Officers would equally get fed up with ‘the nice player who is a bit supbar’. And no guild likes ‘the jerk’, ‘the time waster’ or ‘the loot whore’. I like my guild and the people in it, but when those people who left are clearly looking for something the guild was never intended to provide, I can’t help but feel they are better off leaving because its the tensions in expectations that are the biggest problem most guilds face.

A "best of" compilation, 1979-1982, appeared in 2007, pulling ten tracks from the two Alley Cats albums and nothing from either Zarkons record (although inexplicably excluding undeniable classics like "Nothing Means Nothing," "Too Much Junk," or "Give Me A Little Pain"). The accompanying DVD with five video clips is a nice touch, however, and this CD remains the only in-print example of The Alley Cats' work.

In this chapter, sibling rivalry was quiet intense to the point of murder. But God had assessed the situation for Cain and told him exactly what was going on, how to overcome and avoid the terrible the result of his bitterness and jealousy. He did not listen. He killed his brother.

The apostle Paul had been raised in Tarsus, a city of Cilicia but trained in Jerusalem. He knew the seasons, the weather patterns and was able to discern the dangers that lay ahead. But he was also a man of prayer having the Spirit of God dwelling in his spirit and soul. He had a Godly communication the world would call nonsense.
Eamon also takes a pot-shot at the “tired polemics of prancing ponies of polarised politics” and it is hard to conclude that he is confining his remarks to the two coalition partners, Fine Gael and Labour. And coming on the back of the strained and conflicting accounts of Eamon’s resignation, and the iconic photograph – shown here in photos 11&12 – showing his unhappiness at the Ard Dheis, it would be surprising if this speech didn’t have imminent ramifications. Eamon’s blog is called “Outside the Box” which may turn out to have more than one meaning!

This isn’t good. The only remedy I can think of to this (barring drugs, which sadly is no longer an option) is altering my perceptions and appreciating whatever miniscule good thing that may occur throughout a day. That bubbly sound and beautiful smell when the coffee finishes brewing, the actual coffee itself. Watching the fireflies (Brian calls them that; I call them lightning bugs – is that a north/south thing?) and spiders catching and spinning up their prey when it’s finally cool enough to be outside after the ball of fire sets for the day. My evening walks and/or bike rides that I’ve started back doing, albeit sporadically. Being into the long stretch of good books I’ve been on lately. Lunch the other day with my three new co-workers, all of whom I’m beginning to get to know and really like. The new vehichle, which I still can’t believe is mine every time I climb into it. The occasional thunderstorm respites that make everything greener and cooler and alive again, however temporarily.
I remember way back in the paleolithic era when the debate was actually going on over what health care reform would look like (before we settled on "greatest threat to liberty ever," that is) and my comment section was deluged with folks who railed against the very concept of universality in healthcare insurance. They, further, denied that such a thing as involuntary uninsurance existed, or that underinsurance was a problem at all. These commenters tended to be the rugged individualists of our great nation, and their testimonies were along the lines of: "I have type 1 diabetes and I've had three limbs amputated and I do just fine with my catastrophic health insurance plan" or "I have chosen not to buy health insurance and I'm just so badass that if I ever get sick I will go off onto an ice floe so as not to be a burden to society, so why should we hand out free healthcare to goddamned moochers?"

After three months at the harsh and abusive prison of Pengkalan Chepa, it turned out that my incarceration was far from over as I had fervently prayed for, each and every day, for no less than five times a day during that holy month of Ramadan. Unlike the four others who were with me on that day, I had also made the effort to fast the whole of that month. And, unlike them who were already planning to shoot up drugs again should they be released “just for the heck of it”, I had no such thoughts. I honestly and sincerely felt I had done “all the right things”, the best that I could. I only wanted to be released; to go home and see my children. Was that too much to ask from God??

We turn the tap on as low as it will go to get some water in the sink (I find the longer it takes to put water in the sink the better since he likes to play with the water as it is coming out) with the plug in and about 1 1/2" of water I give him different size cups, measuring spoons and small containers. He pours water from one to the other, he seemed to figure out yesterday that some cups are smaller than others so he can't pour a whole big cup of water in it. I love watching him explore and learn!!
Madalyn Murry O’Hair actually did lead American Atheists by force of personality. She could dominate hundreds of people just by walking into a room. I heard her speak at LSU (Louisiana State University) one night. She trashed Christianity in the most vulgar terms before a largely Christian audience that sat in speechless horror. When she finished, she didn’t exit through the wings as speakers usually do, but down the center aisle. I thought, oh, my god, they’re going to beat her to death, but they made a path for her that was wide enough for five people, and the only sound I heard was that of her heels striking the floor. I was reminded of Moses parting the Red Sea.

As long as we are in this body of flesh we will make mistakes, fall short, sin. But if we will “press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:14 KJV)” He will keep growing us toward that goal. And someday after while we will hear those sweet words of “welcome in” from our Lord and know it was worth it all.
In book two, there is a break from school and Kiram goes home to the Haldiim district in Anacleto. At first I was concerned that this meant there wouldn't be as much time spent with the characters I'd come to love so much, but it didn't end up being a problem since some of them lived nearby and others visited. Also, this allowed a firsthand look at the Haldiim and how their way of life contrasted with that of the Cadeleonians. It was particularly refreshing that even though they were more open-minded and less strict than the Cadeleonians, they were not portrayed as perfect in every way. Even though they allowed people to marry a person of either gender and seemed in general more lenient, the matriarchy still had some of the same pitfalls as a patriarchy. Marriages were still often made based on forging an advantageous connection with another family, and mothers still refused to give their sons certain freedoms. Regardless of culture, everyone seemed human with their own strengths and flaws - even compassionate Kiram was not immune to some prejudice when it came to the Cadeleonian religion.

I was further encouraged when she eyed it in the pan and yelled "cheeeeeese!". Excellent. My plan was working. I scooped a small amount into her princess dish and blew on it til it cooled. She was ready, spoon in hand as soon as I put it down. She took a scoop put it in her mouth and... spit it out. Then she picked up the cherished princess dish, held it out to me and said "No." Another battle lost.

When I visited my friend’s home in Nichada Thani, she took us to Que Pasa Mexican Restaurant. You probably wouldn’t go out to Nichada just to eat since it takes about 30 minutes on high way from Bangkok without traffic. This restaurant is very close to the International School Bangkok, so if you travel to Bangkok to check out the city prior to your move and want to visit the school before enrolling your child(ren), this is a great place to check out as well!!
Vampire’s Quest “Beloved gay vampire lovers Xavier and Thomas return…” So, it’s a sequel. And it’s about gay vampires. What’s up with the undead being all sexual lately?

Finally, I didn’t like the few changes they made from the book to the movie such as Sennaca being left with night lock or the elimination of Madge. Madge was important considering she was the only female friend that Katniss had. Madge added another dimension to Katniss. All I can say is that a man most of made the movie and totally didn’t understand the importance of our “girlfriends” and how they complete us!

The bike fitter dude readjusted my aerobars (Profile Designs T1+) by sliding them back towards the saddle, making them more narrow, and raising the farthest end so that there is a slight incline from the pads to the tips of the aerobars. In doing this, my bike computer (Bontrager Node) would no longer fit on my bars. He continued to make small adjustment here and there and added a stem that comes off my aerobars so that my computer could rest there.

Edwards appeal was dimming. His family life in tatters. His wife’s health was deteriorating and the mistress was about to give birth. The series of denials that followed was pathetic. A man caught in his own web of lies could only stand by and watch his hopes and dreams go up in smoke. The scandal that followed was jaw dropping.

The Drain Claw is wire tool with a little brush like thing on the end. You can bend and twist the rod inside drains to capture hair and push away other clogs- naturally no harsh chemicals needed. This environmentally friendly claw was developed by a real estate agent so he could keep his bath drains open without using chemicals.

I also just read a study… It’s about 5 yrs old, but was the first of its kind. Only half of people even use ATM cards for direct-draw purchases! I think I only have once, when it was a $50 discount (at which point I wouldn’t mind paying a $5 fee to save $50!). The other half of people pay using credit, check, or cash. No ATM swipes.
“What, like this stuff?” Rosa pulled at Carmen’s worn black t-shirt, “What are Sex Pistols? They look gross.” She sneered at the image of Sid. “You should try and fit in more Carmen, dress nicer. All the boys are afraid of you.”
You might be thinking, "Hmmm, perhaps you could take some reading with you to occupy your time on the 33 hour trek to Tehran." You would be justified in having that thought. I, however, want to complete my self-imposed required reading before I leave. "Why?" you ask. Ummm, because I'm a masochist? No, really it has more to do with the fact that I want to feel prepared for this trip. Some people obsess over packing; I obsess over studying so I won't feel so stupid in a country that's completely new to me. So, I may not have socks when I reach Iran, but I'll know something about the Sassanid dynasty and its effect on Persian literature. One might argue that socks would be more practical, but I wear research like Linus wore his security blanket.
Those principles and mottos worked well for my career, finally having a child, building a life I wanted, more or less. I can definitely apply that to writing as well as other pursuits. Yes, I’ve retreated more than once and there’s no dishonor in that. I set up strategy, made plans and regrouped—always with the plan of moving forward. I’ve maintained a sense on honor, chosen the right path based on principles. I’m teaching my son to do the same.

Finally we came to the Sistine Chapel after nearly an hour of shuffling, and we had to pause on the landing. It was spectacular. No doubt. But by the end of the maze, we found ourselves a little burned out. We’d seen a lot. At the same time, the crowd denied you the time to examine anything at leisure. We had to force ourselves to stay in the packed Chapel longer, but in the end, we were glad to get out and get some air.
We recently had some family pictures taken! My kind, gentle-hearted neighbor and friend, Lauren, spent an afternoon with us in our busy, bustling downtown metro, with her camera and hubby in tow. Lauren has a talent for snapping pictures and an eye for art, and I knew she'd do a great job.
How is it that major artists make a name for themselves, and then turn around and do paint by number? There is nothing original about Hirst's canvases (don't get me started on the sliced, pickled cows, for real). I believe he has an atelier of devoted, starving artists painting his polka dots for him.

Dr. Pradip Kumar Sarmah is the founder of the Rickshaw Bank and at 46, he is the oldest (and most experienced, and probably the coolest) entrepreneur of the lot. A veterinarian and Ashoka Fellow, Pradip has been working for 7 years to improve the lives of 8 million rickshaw drivers in India, under the aegis of his Centre for Rural Development. Rickshaw drivers are the poorest of employed city dwellers, making less than $2/day carrying loads of 200 kilos in broiling heat, with no way out of poverty since they don’t own the rickshaws but rent them at usurious rates.
Gueule d’Amour (France…Jean Grémillon)
Last week I went to hear New York Times food columnist and award winning cookbook author, Mark Bittman, speak in Madison. He spoke of a visit to his physician in 2007 where he learned he had high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, and was 40 pounds overweight. His doctor told him to become a vegan (omit animal and dairy products from the diet) to reverse his diseases. He compromised by agreeing to eat the vegan way for breakfast and lunch, and dinner he ate whatever he wanted within reason. His breakfast might consist of oatmeal or multigrain hot cereal, whole wheat toast, and fruit. Lunch may have been a salad with sliced fruits and vegetables, bean burrito, vegetable or lentil soup, or vegetable stir fry. Dinner was what he had eaten in the past.
It was once that individuals that have been going offshore on cross country cruises selected boats that had been extremely heavily built and were generally not to fast, often unresponsive using conditions. Tactics on these boats were somewhat distinct from the engineered boats these days. These older era boats could well be forced to heave to or lay a hull in two extremes. The crew would close everything up and go below and wait out. Sometimes this was successful, sometimes it wasn’t.

I think in my previous post I thought something was fishy with Celia. She was definitely set up to be the villain of this tale. But I agree that the ending really didn’t add up. I think there should have been more plot devices to point us in the right direction. Either that or a better motivation for Celia. I think had we gotten to know her better, to feel her bitterness, it would have made more sense. As it stands now, it all seemed to come out of no where…
Benjamin Fulford, the former East-West bureau chief for Forbes Magazine, had been discussing this for some time — and although I had interviewed him four or five times, that was the full extent of my involvement.

I just thought I'd tell you about a sewing group I've helped to organize and that I'm mentoring.Our small community is near a large lake ( Grand Lake ) and has a much larger population in summer than the rest of the year.Among the permanent residents is a fairly large group of retired people like myself who have time on their hands. There is a well equipped community hall about a mile from my house and I thought I'd try to persuade people to come and sew with me on Thursday afternoons. We've been getting together for about two months now and I'm very happy with what is transpiring.

Square des Missions Etrangeres, however, is separated from this street by a strange, empty plot of ground, with a very dense hedge between it and the garden itself. In this totally enclosed empty garden, whose only prupose seems to be to keep a distance between the garden and the passers-by on rue Bac, there is a bust of Chateaubriand, two metres above the ground, in the form of the god Terminus, commanding a cinder covered surface.

After that I messed with the baskets of clean clothes, and sorted down from two to one basket. I then soaked the dishes, hit a couple of spots of emesis, got my shower in and decided against a shave (my pseudo-beard rough cut is just right to look good, at least to me), sorted dirty clothes and put the first load in. Then... *BaM!* That is it for a bit.
The list goes on and on.
Oh gosh, i wanna tell you so much but i don't know where to begin. Although i didn't post the last three months of 2011, there were some experiences relating to my art. I was a participant on the artmarket Arnhem. I had mixed feelings about it, but i wanted to do it, to see what will happen. It was my first time and other participants*artists were going to critize my art. To see if i am good enough for the market next year. I don't wanna be presumptuous, but to be honest, in my humble opinion there were only two good, original painters and one ceramist who was good. But still i was pretty nervous.

Although there are heaps of Fringe acts and Womadelaide is happening right now, I gain an enormous amount of personal comfort at getting things done here at home. These things include study, cleaning, De-cluttering, and making my home smell and look beautiful. I often fall into bed at midnight buggered but gee, those sheets are fresh and white.
I live in France, so it was impossible for me to take my own photo references. I spent several hours looking at pictures on her DeviantArt page, then I turned off my computer and started doodling in my sketchbook. I did a «cartoon» version of her face … only her face. I knew what I wanted to do, doing a complete sketch was not a necessity. I made her body with a black silhouette as I adjusted the composition.
The year 2010 also was the wettest on record, according to the Global Historical Climatology Network. But since rain and snowfall patterns varied greatly around the world, scientists say more research is needed to establish a link between the warmer temperatures with the unusual moisture.

I know there is no sense in worrying about the future when I really have absolutely no idea what to expect. I do need to come up with a birthing plan though. Fortunately, that is nothing that is written in stone and we can change it at any time, but it gives our doctors and nurses an idea of what our situation is and what we’d like to have take place once this baby is born. Problem is, I just don’t know right now, not knowing exactly what we are facing!!

I recently read “The Perks Of Being A Wallflower” and it really struck a chord with me. I knew it was going to be made into a movie so I wanted to go ahead and read the book. I am honestly upset with myself for never having heard of the book before this year. When I read a book I like to underline or highlight my favorite lines or quotes in it. It helps me focus and gives me something to go back to. The quote I want to focus on today is.

There was another very cute thing last night: a fox cub came to explore.. Unfortunately it was too dark to take a photo, and to be honest I was in a bit of a panic about the potential repercussions of a fox getting into the church and peeing somewhere. I needed to retrieve my buckets from the garden while not letting the fox inside, and it all got a bit lolrus-esque. Fortunately my cunning plan of closing the door behind me and peeking out from time to time to see if the fox was still there worked a treat.
In fact, I’m quite sure of it.
The government and the judiciary both should show maturity and there should be no clash between the institutions over a letter that at the end of the day might not mean very much at all. Democracy should survive in our country. It already had been weakened by the wrong policies of the past governments, especially by successive military rules.

Najib claimed that RM1.5 billion needed was “not substantial compared to EPF funds”. He further added that “the scheme does not undermine the interests of the EPF because the value of the housing units in the market is far higher than the purchase price… If a buyer is unable to or does not repay the loan, the unit can be sold for a higher price.”

Golia's response to these complaints was blunt, solid, and memorable. Basically, to paraphrase, he said for these people to stop complaining -- great artists make great art, he said, whether they have one square foot and three dollars or 20,000 square foot and a million. It is not the conditions stacked against these artists that made them mediocre, they were mediocre by essence.

What makes it worse is that I have come back with so many stories from Kolkata. Of photographing mishti while I was dying of hunger, of stumbling onto ponds and the Gandhi Bhavan at Ultadanga, a Highway on the Plate lunch at 5 pm at Sanjha Chulha, of getting to know the phuchkawallahs outside South City Mall, of the lemon tart at Kookie Jar at South City and the guy at the counter who smiled in recognition, of the young lady who came and introduced herself to me as a reader in the middle of the Park Street Metro station, of a rites of passage long delayed at Oly Pub – the fantastic food and the secret behind the men in the ladies’ toilet there, Someplace Else for a nightcap and reliving fond memories in the compnay of new friends, of food food and more food cooked by mom, a visit to Grand Parents and the pain of eating kochuri alu and mishti ordered from a shop… a pain which would be microscopic compared to what granny (Didu) would have felt at mnot being able to cook something for me… old age is bloody cruel, of the seven packs of Mokhorochak Chanachur I carried back and of a last impromptu stop at Nizam’s at VIP Road to pick up rolls and biriyani on the way to Mumbai and a photo shoot that followed.
So in turn i went to get the actual dictionary of a coward. Cowards are people who lacks the courage to do or endure dangerous or unpleasant things. So for the purpose of this post, I will translate “coward” into those who are afraid to stare an obvious problem in the face. They lack the courage to endure unpleasant people. So basically everyone in the room knows the “pink elephant” is in the room, but no one wants to point it out. But when the pink elephant leaves, let the chatter begin! “Girl, if I was you I would of…”, ” I wish she would have done that to me…”, or even worse, they allow the pink elephant to push them out of the room they LOVE being in. Identify it, face it, confront it, and let the chips fall as they may. Does that mean that WW3 has to occur? No. Is it best to use tact over emotion to solve the problem, yes. Alot of times when we REACT instead of INITIATE ACTION, we find ourselves in the the dramatic situation we try so hard to avoid. I do believe that when 1 “previous coward” steps into the world of bravery that others will follow. When one person speaks their mind, heart and soul into the atmosphere, and others who have the same opinions are able to hear/see that, it turns to inspiration. It allows the floodgates of words, action, and feelings to flow. Instead of being cooped up in that room with the elephant, you open the double doors and let that bitch out! No need to deal with the elephant when it’s chained up in the yard.

How much has really changed remains to be seen, but it is encouraging to see reports like this one from today's Guardian:
The forces of Common Purpose achieve their goals by deception, and this yet another set of regulations which were drafted to achieve more than they appear to. The target again is primarily young white males, because they are the group our enemies resent most, but do not be fooled, we are all in their sights. The programme continues and will do so unless or until the people of Britain wake up and realise what is being done to them.

Did you notice anything odd about this 1825 house? There is not a chimney. The foundation looks as though work was started and never completed. I’d love to spend more time staring at this abandoned house. While historic, these 6/6 windows likely replaced the original 12/12 windows.

K's dad called us on Monday night and left us a message...... it stated "K, this is dad, I was in Everett and a lady hit me...I need you to come pick me up.... (lots of police scanner background noise) (dad asking police where at?) "I'll be at the denny's on Pacific way" thank you. SHEESH. We'd been out at my cousins for a get together of a family member that was in town.... and get home about 10 minutes after this message. My first instinct was to call Denny's on Pacific Way....so we did and they asked around...no dad. My dad then tries to tell us how to get to the Denny's and we then realize we're not being able to keep them in our heads as we just want to get going.... he suggests taking his GPS - GREAT! We get in the car...... K decides to call her step mom just in case someone else is already on their way....we really don't want to make the trek if someone is already picking him up. Someone was already on their way.....we turned around and came home. About 10 minutes after being home... Denny's was calling us. It was K's dad. He had just gotten dropped off there. (HE HAS NO CELL PHONE!!!!!!!!) Ends up....... a lady was getting on the freeway in Everett..... hit ice... Dad was in the middle lane.....the lady hit him went flying one direction and sent Dad flying another direction where he spun a few times then hit a concrete barrier. NO ONE WAS HURT and NO ONE ELSE WAS INVOLVED!!!!!!!! can you believe it!? His truck is totaled and he's using our truck for now..... He hasn't been sore, wasn't hurt or anything. We're glad everyone came out safe and not hurt!
And how eternally bitter hope can be. It tastes oh so sweet if it is fulfilled, but a long and drawn out, fruitless hope turns the soul sour. It stings, and you can’t help it. After every sting, you cover it up with more hope, until the moment has passed, and your hope is in the past. And then what are you left with? Well you are certainly not alone. Because trust me, another little piece of hope, however unrelated, will find its way into your life.
While it is understood that there are other celebrations taking place during this winter month of December, Hanukkah and Kwanza most notably, the prevailing holiday to which almost all people are referring when they say Happy Holidays is, indeed, Christmas. If a person uses the HH greeting, and is then asked which holiday he or she is celebrating, the answer will most likely be Christmas. Whether the Christ child or the red suited Santa, it’s still going to be, for most people, Christmas that is on their schedule of holiday observances. People buy Christmas trees, Christmas presents, and eat Christmas cookies. We sing Christmas carols while strolling past Christmas decorations. Are we then left with nothing more expressive of the experience than to say “Happy Holidays”?
Khaw Boon Wan, Minister for National Development, said in his latest blog post that the data is ‘reassuring’, as “the application rates suggest that our policies are responding well to the diverse needs of our flat buyers.”

From the point of view of basin development the main interest in the hydrology of the Blue Nile within Ethiopia is for flood forecasting for reservoir operation and to give warning of possible inundation in Khartoum and in the agricultural areas downstream.(Sutcliffe and Lazenby, 1994)

Talk about good customer service! From the time I originally emailed the company to the time I received my replacement brush was less than a week. I was so excited about this that I had to share with you guys - good customer service is hard to come by, even though you would think companies would all be bending over backwards to make their consumers happy.

A word of caution – Even with leaving each layer to dry for 24 hours or more, there is only so much time you can spend brushing a new layer on before the last one will start to come up. Work quickly and decisively and you won’t have a problem getting nice, solid layers of colour with this paint.

The rest of the trip down passed uneventfully, and we were back home by late afternoon. It was a great backpack, and I was really proud of our scouts! Not only did they deal well with the cold and the snow, but also the unexpected challenge of the bridge. It's a great group of guys and I always enjoy backpacking and hiking with them (and especially with our scoutmaster Shane). I look forward to going back to this trail again in the spring when the wildflowers are out. But I'm learning more and more how much I love winter hiking and backpacking! Since Christmas break is coming up soon I'm looking forward to some more hiking soon.
I'm talking about hanging in there and moving forward when we've fallen off our plan.
The gardener's seeds are the author's words. You need to choose the strongest, healthiest seeds and plant them in the most appropriate place. Different seeds/words have different attributes and where you put them is as important as how strong they are. Once you've decided on the best spot (sun or shade, soil type, drainage etc) some people might place them in neat, regimented rows; others might choose wavy lines or zigzags. Either way, you want them to be clear and easy to identify.
It was a full house that night, lots of women trying to give birth to baby’s. The nurses were running around from one woman to another. I was sort of low on the priority scale, because my contractions were measuring very close together and not very consistent. They didn’t even check to see if I was dilated. Two hours later I was feeling the contractions a lot more. I felt it all in my back. (Back Labor…not fun) My husband had to keep rubbing my lower back to get me through the contractions. Considering his broken elbows are still healing, he did a great job. When the nurse came in to check on me, she kept telling me that I’m still in early labor, because my contractions were still spaced pretty close together and not long enough. She kept joking that when I’m no longer able to talk or smile then we will know that things are progressing. She told me that I would still be here for a few more hours before I could even get my own room, that there were many woman more progressed than me. However, I begged for the midwife to come in, and at least tell me if I’ve started to dilate. Finally the nurse sent her in, after she realized that, though my contraction were still short and close together, I was in a great deal of pain. I’m not much of a shouter… I’m more the type to silently suffer and moan. I think this might have thrown them off a bit, because let me just say there were some woman in there that had me scared with their screaming. When the midwife finally checked me, everyone was shocked to find out that I was already 8 cm dilated. When she told me, I asked her if she was sure, and it was not some cruel joke. She told me she was positive, and that I would be beating out all the other woman for a room.

I am a passionate scrapbooker and cardmaker who loves trying new crafty products and learning new things! I have been scrapbooking for about 10 years and have gotten into card making about a year ago. Talk about addicting!! :) I very rarely complete a project without using ribbon in the process... I was lucky enough to get to play with some 3GirlJam ribbon and I am in love!! It adds so much more texture to projects than regular ribbon!! If you follow my blog, you will definitely see more projects done with this ribbon - I'm already itching to work on my next idea!! :)

He recently broke his elbow in a freak horseback riding accident at the ripe old age of 2 and a half. It occured in his living room, on the back of his loving, used to be overprotective, mother! What a thing. Poor kid had to have surgery to pin his elbow back together. But I heard from a close source that both he and Mom (his mom) took it wonderfully, with only a minimal amount of crying on both of their parts. :) If you are reading this Laura, I commend you. You are a wonderful mom.
I’ve made a lot of online friends from America. My American friends are fiercely patriotic and conservative. They haven’t yet come to terms with the fact that their country’s doomed, thanks to the inevitability of developing socialism in a democracy. The 1700’s spirit of their Founding Fathers is still deeply embedded in their culture and they’re fiercely protective of their independence. Their moral superiority is referred to as American exceptionalism.

What history shows is that corporate complacency will eventually lead to a “little guy” popping up with a superior product and a lower price. That is what keeps greedy monopolistic bastards from enslaving us all and forcing us to buy shoddy products and services in their company store. (Sounds like the federal government, doesn't it?) The only thing in US history that has prevented this is government protection, bought and paid for by the big guys. Look around you. Anywhere you see a monopoly, a government is behind it.

My son brushes his teeth with (and secretly swallows) Dora toothpaste. There, I’ve said it. I didn’t buy the said toothpaste to necessarily make a point, but only because I got a really good deal on it. That said, I’ll admit that I did hesitate a tiny bit, and later felt that I could really be making a point. But this is toothpaste we are talking about, and our preference regarding dental cleaning supplies is privy only to a rather small group of people who might step into our bathroom. If I notice a great deal on a pretty Princess backpack, I will certainly pass.

Avery Ellie's Brown Ale: This beautiful, deep russet brew has a sweet and somewhat nutty character. Crystal and chocolate malts give this beer a brown sugar maltiness with hints of vanilla and nuts, while subtle hopping gives it an overall drinkability that's second to none.

In my last scattershot post, I noted that Dickens indulges often in cheap sentiment. At the same time, what keeps me reading (aside from the wonderfully inventive way he has with language and that is a pure joy for this reader) is the way Dickens is unsentimental. His people are thoughtless, cruel, arrogant, selfish people as much as they're pure of heart and good good good. His best characters, of course, are those who are both good and weak. Possibly I only think that because it mirrors my Western Christian upbringing, wherein humanity is assumed to be good but weak. I don't know. I've never thought about that before, but it's an interesting thought that's doubtless been explored already by smarter folk than me. I shall now wonder about my own novels and the relationship between my characters and the lives of the saints. Because I'll bet there's something there. But I digress.

But woe to you if -- or more likely, when -- the rules change. White Americans may soon find themselves unable or unwilling to stand up to challenge the new political methods that will be the inevitable result of the ethnic metamorphosis now taking place in America. Unable to cope with the new rules of the game -- violence, mob riots, intimidation through accusations of racism, demands for proportionality based on racial numbers, and all the other social and political weapons used by the have-nots to bludgeon treasure and power from the haves -- Americans, like others before them, will no doubt cave in. They will compromise away their independence and ultimately their way of life.

But then a terrible boating accident takes the lives of several of her friends, and Miranda is rescued by a mysterious boy who haunts her dreams. Consumed by guilt from the accident, she finds refuge in late-night swims—and meets Christian, a boy who seems eerily familiar, but who is full of mystery: He won’t tell her where he is from, or why they can only meet at the beach. But Miranda falls for him anyway…and discovers that Christian’s secrets, though meant to protect her, may bring her nothing but harm.

There are aspects that make them not for everyone, probably including some of the aspects I personally find appealing. In fact, when I first started reading her work, I was put off by the artistic style which I would liken to the body styles and general artistic school of Michaelangelo with the rounded body parts and the realistic bulges and shadows. In other words, not necessarily flattering. It's dirtier, to me, and everyone looks bruised. Additionally, and this is particularly important if you're already squeamish about overt gay sex, she draws graphic sex scenes that go on for pages and it's sloppy and gooey (I'm pretty certain the human body doesn't ooze that much, uh, stuff from everywhere). I'm pretty hardened to graphic sex scenes and they're hard even for me to take.

My husband and I have made a commitment to explore a different place in and around our local area each weekend with our son-----rivers, beaches, Redwood forest, fields and meadows-----someplace we haven't visited in a while or have never been before. The idea is to spend as much time outdoors, enjoying the sights and sounds, as we possibly can, and to allow time together as a family doing something in which we can be actively engaged with the natural world around us. We are so blessed to live in such a rich and diverse area of this country. Humboldt County has something for everyone and it would be a shame not to explore and become intimately familiar with this wonderland we call home.
I love beer. More so, I love big beers, and beers don't get much bigger than barley wines. And Victory Brewing does one helluva job with their Old Horizontal. Old Ho', as it is affectionately known, is a winter seasonal, meant to warm the soul.

I realized the old version was so riddled with drama, the plot was like an engine running on maple syrup… maybe it could run, albeit slowly, but mostly it would either wreck the car and engine. After reading tons (and I mean about 2 to 3 books a week for the past 4 months) I picked up on authors that clung to the drama versus those who really wanted to get things moving. The books that clung onto the drama (cough City of Bones cough) seemingly dragged on forever pursuing trails of potential plot pieces that were quickly resolved with minimal impact. Whereas, books that jump right into the fray incorporated the dialogue and events made to enhance the experience, not detract from it. I got so confused during the books that had a million little subplots and details, it was boring. Sure, each story is allocated to go off on tangents and tirades, it is the author’s book, but going on a juxtaposing but completely separate path causes the main road to become jumbled in a web of complexities and obscurities.
Well, Bejeweled is actually helping me almost as much as the therapist's couch. I just came up with something interesting and I'm sharing it so that if anyone else is living like this, they a) know they aren't alone and b) maybe see that if they want, they can break out of it.

The Avengers movie seriously touch my heart, because this might be the first time watching all the hero gathered together in real life on big screen cinema (normally I watch Justice League on Cartoon Network), that is why I was very excited about this movie. Once there is rumors about it, it was last year and right after watching Thor (2011), here is the [Link] that I write about characters introduction for The Avengers movie. Eventually on social site such as Facebook and 9gag contain too much spoiler already, and also it is base on Marvel story . . . I will still write some spoiler on it. I will still post the character list from The Avengers movie and rate it "How Awesome" about it (from top to toe).

When to use: After an explanation from a nearby fan, especially if it’s one that you need in order to understand what just happened. Substituing “Pablo Neruda” with, say, “Barry Alvarez” is an acceptable modification.
The business has no relation to Sammy and Bella Jakubiak, the NSW sisters who used the same name for their home restaurant in the TV series My Kitchen Rules. The shop is a popular stop on local food tours - just make sure you get there early to nab a square of authentic cheesecake or a sugary jam-filled donut.
I just found an excellent article on church discipline concerning sexual sins of pastors and staff. It clearly points out that the discipline measures outlined are contingent on true repentance (a change of thought and behavior) and not having broken the law. This is especially important where child abuse is concerned, as it must be reported to the law. These offending “pastors” should never be pushed off on unsuspecting churches and parishioners. This is how childhood sexual abuse is perpetrated on so many children in our churches. If it goes unreported, it gives the perpetrator opportunity for new victims and no healing takes place.

We talked about the liquor laws in Arizona and what I needed to do. He pointed me in the direction of many, many different websites that I needed to be aware with a lot of information that I needed to know. He explained about trademarks and and articles of incorporation. And when we were done, he told me to keep him in the loop. He was interested in becoming a part of it. Everyone hates attorneys until they need one. So I think it would be a good idea to have one as part of my team.

In 2009 Obama approved Ben Bernanke’s nomination to another term as Chairman of the Fed. Ben Bernanke had succeeded Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in 2006. Bernanke was a Harvard educated economist and an academic. He had been a professor of economics at Princeton, and was a proclaimed expert on the Great Depression, prior to being appointed to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 2002. In 2006, President George W. Bush appointed him to a four year term as Chairman of the Board of the Federal Reserve. It was widely believed (or at least, widely promoted) that Bernanke’s machinations to stem the crisis of 2008 had saved the world from disaster. Bernanke was even named Time magazine’s 2009 Man of the Year. Thus Obama kept him in power.
“The actions can be interpreted as treachery and it should stop immediately. The ATM (armed forces) is the nation’s wall of defence that should be supported by all levels of the people, regardless of ethnicity, religion and political position,” Zulkifeli, who heads the Armed Forces, said in a statement out on Thursday.
When we first moved in last October, the weather was starting to get cool, so I switched my futon to it's dark raspberry coloured microsuede cover. Looking back at how messy it was back then, it reminds me of how far its come since then. This was during our first week when we still were living out of suitcases and boxes.
Uncle Dana, you’re statement also misses the mark when it comes to the Olympic committee giving its stamp of approval. If and when MMA becomes an Olympic Sport, amateurs will still be competing without pay. Plus, if Amateur MMA didn’t already exist, there would be nothing to get behind. From my point of view, the further the Olympics Committee stays away from mixed martial arts, the better. It would probably only end up diluting the sport to one degree or another with modified rules, judging, round lengths etc. The last thing MMA as a whole needs is another group of bureaucrats screwing up the purity of the sport. Am I right?

Back then, the paper didn't cost as much as it did these days, so it was fairly easy to persuade people to get it. The paper I sold was printed and delivered three times a week and only cost around fifteen dollars for a whole year's worth. That was a great deal, even then. I had no trouble selling in the affluent sections of the suburbs.

I've always struggled with really trusting God. I know He loves me, but felt that I still had to look out for myself. He doesn't owe me peace and good haircuts. I always thought it made sense that if I believed Him "all out'', He might test my commitment by destroying my life (because that's loving?). It's not right. I'm just explaining my flawed thinking.
I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Tuason. I wish to add, however the following observations: Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the legislative intent is to make Commonwealth Act No. 671, effective during the existence of the emergency contemplated therein and that it is within the exclusive province of the political departments to determine whether said emergency continues or has ceased to exist, I am of the conviction that, in view of the formal and unmistakable declarations of both the Congress and the President, said Act No. 671, should be held as having lost its force and effect.
For example, I like to sing karaoke or get up and give a lecture/speech/act on stage in front of a room full of people, which apparently (or maybe I’m just perpetuating the myth) is the number one fear in America, but small talk at a party with one or two new people leaves me tongue tied with fear that I might embarass myself. For me, that’s the gorilla beating his chest at Rain Forest Cafe. For someone else small talk feels completely safe, but it terrifies me.

I thought I'd write something that wasn't fun or fantastical. I was reading an article today about job satisfaction, and how amusement park workers are among the lowest tier. It made me think about what it would really be like to be one them, and I found myself writing a short story. So here it is. Warning: there are some relatively adult subjects and language.

But a funny thing happened when she called to make the reservation, only a day or two after she had first dined there. "Aha, Catherine", they said, "we remember you, we just read your blog entry". Her Maverick post had been on the web for less than 24 hours and the restaurant already knew about it. I was surprised. It takes a couple of days for the google bots to add new entries to the search engines and Catherine didn't link directly to the restaurant in her blog, so they couldn't have found her blog through visitor referrals. When she asked how they found the post, they replied that their PR company had called to let them know. This is something I hadn't considered before. Restaurants employ public relations people, and these people clearly do have blogs on their radar.

First of all appropriate because Jesus told his disciples they would be his witnesses in Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and unto the utermost part of the Earth. Jerusalem represented their home town (Wisconsin Rapids) and Judaea was their equivalent of a state (Wisconsin). So FIRST we must minister to those AT HOME.
When I arrived back home, I double-checked the solid wood bed frame lying in our living room (there's no mattress as of yet) just to be sure. That's when I saw some funky-looking patina that may (or may not) be bed-bug-doo, as well as some dubious looking shriveled insect shells.
John 6:27-29 reads thus:
To tolerate sin in one’s own life is not love; that is arrogance. To tolerate sin within the church is not love, nor is it spiritual; it is pride and rebellion.

Almost every major corporation tries to minimize its taxes, of course. For Apple, the savings are especially alluring because the company’s profits are so high. Wall Street analysts predict Apple could earn up to $45.6 billion in its current fiscal year — which would be a record for any American business.
Karma must have been at play in what happened next, as no sooner had we made space for the next station and was heading back to continue with our original plan a message came across the air that three Cheetah had been found less than five minutes away. Being perfectly positioned and with everyone else still trying to get to the Wilddog we could make our way straight to the sighting. On our way there I mentioned to Goodman that we were on our way to see Cheetah, I wish I could have taken a picture of the disbelief and amasement written all over his face. This was soon replaced by excitement and I'm sure I looked pretty much the same at hearing the news. It is not often that you get to see both of these endangered animals let alone in the same afternoon within fifteen minutes of one another. Finding them sitting on the sand in the middle of the Tsharalumi made for a great picture but I was not quick enough as they got up and ran off to the opposite bank. Making our way around they were lost in a drainage line before we could get back in to see them properly. With the light failing fast we rushed around the area trying to relocate and our perseverance paid off with us finding them to the West of where they had been slowly walking on the road towards us. Killing the engine we sat quietly hoping they would move into a clearing not far from us, we never expected them to walk right up to the front of the vehicle, hesitate and then head back slowly to the riverbed in the East. It easily rates as one of my best Cheetah sightings ever, certainly the

And that’s why God, from the very first week of creation, instituted a Sabbath rest. It wasn’t for His benefit, as if the Almighty God who created a sun, moon, and planet with the power of His words grew weary and needed to sleep. No, the Sabbath was not for God. Instead, Jesus “said to them, ‘The Sabbath was made for man” (Mark 2:27).

This is another popular dish in the outskirt districts of Java Island. Young tapioca leaves are soft and it is nice if eaten with vegetarian sambal. However there are some sap in these young leaves that needs to be removed before eaten. In order to do that they are best boiled in water with a little soda bicarbonate added. Boiling the leaves this way also helps to soften the fibres in the leaves. Tapioca leaves have high contents of nutrients, protein and crude fibre.

A few blocks from Lamar’s apartment, Vonne parked her car, grabbed her pearl handle 22 out the glove compartment and walked surveying the terrain. Her black overcoat blew in the night air covering and uncovering a bulletproof vest and a tidy pinstripe button up, safety first. At the side of Lamar’s Apt, she noticed his light on and pulled the hammer back on her pistol. She paced herself down the corridor and up the stairs, 2D. His front door was slightly cracked, a bit unusual for Lamar. Prepared for war, Vonne pushed the door open swiftly enough for it not to squeak, but soft enough as for it not to slam against the wall. The sound of running water bathroom caught her ear. She checked the kitchen and bedrooms, clear. Grabbing a knife from the kitchen, she hid it in the living room and tiptoed to the bathroom. Eight candles twinkled about the room illuminating a drawn bubble bath and Lamar in a pair of black slacks, and a bare rippling chest.

Did you work toward equality for women in any way prior to August 2008?” wrote Bennett. “It would be nice to think that you’ve suddenly discovered sexism and are interested in joining us in the struggle for full equality. But this really smacks of the worst kind of hypocrisy: Folks with no history of working on an issue trying to discredit those who have been working for decades on the issue. Ridiculous.”

It's on the pink side of lavender and has just a touch of gray in it. I think it will be perfect.

The Other Side of the Bridge by Mary Lawson weaves together the stories of two families as they seek solace and redemption across two generations. Set against the backdrop of northern Ontario’s haunting landscapes, the book opens with an unforgettable image of Arthur and Jake Dunn, two brothers whose jealousies will take them beyond the edge of reason, to a deadly point of no return. The sons of a farmer, they come of age during the 1930s, when money is tight and a world war is looming. When a beautiful young woman named Laura moves into their community, she unwittingly propels their sibling rivalry to its breaking point. Years later, the local doctor’s son, Ian, takes a job at the Dunn farm. His mother has left the family, and he develops a troubling attachment to Laura. As he desperately searches for direction in his own life, he stumbles onto a secret that forever alters the course of Arthur’s. With vivid scenes and stunning twists, this is a novel rich with conversation topics.
She told me on Thursday that I was due a CPA review soon and that one had been organised for Monday but she wasn’t sure what time. She told me to ring my psychiatrist’s secretary to find the time. On Friday I rang the secretary to discover that the meeting had been pencilled in the ‘notes’ section but with no time attached so she said she would speak to my psych and find out the time. She rang back a few hours later to tell me that my psych had no recollection of planning a meeting and that one didn’t exist, despite him writing it in the diary.
The bible tells us we are to live like Jesus. Live a life that directs others to him- through our example of how we love. God grew our hearts for the least of these- in reflection of His. He asked us to abandon our dreams, walk away from our self-serving plans and live for His purpose- serving others and in essence serving Him- completely. What I found is that God is an all or nothing kind of guy. Adoption is giving a child all you have and all you are. It’s the perfect picture of God’s love for us.

I'll be taking a couple of days out in Sydney - yay - and then I'll be back in the saddle. Come Wednesday I'm starting a new novel, which means I'll be on the 2000-word-a-day treadmill for the next three months. (Deadline: June.) I'll still be regularly at the theatre - I can't seem to stop - but I have to be realistic about what I can see and write about: a review takes a lot of hours and a lot of brainspace. This in turn means that I'll be firmly saying no to many companies which otherwise I would like to see. Be patient with me, folks, and remember that this novel malarky is how I make my living.
Since there's probably a load of heart-rendering reminiscences and rheumy condolences elsewhere onna web I'll dispense with any hardcore emote for now. After all, it ain't like I actually knew the guy and the only "real" contact that we had was when he commented on a post regarding the identity of the drummer for the old Detroit group the Apostles who I spotted hanging around onstage with the Five in a photo reproduced on a picture sleeve (or at least it looked like him!). Taking the easy way out so-to-speak, I thought that I'd conclude this portion of our broadcast with the following clip of the MC5 (with Davis stage right in obv. SGT. PEPPER-inspired mustache and Nehru jacket) from Detroit television, the same clip that was oh-so-verboten to circulate a good twenny-five years back but now's so common that it pops up everywhere with alarming regularity! Even after all these years it remains a classic showcasing of the pre-LP Five avant rock sound if I do say so myself, and of course what better way to remember Davis than by watching this and listening to his records rather'n indulging in all that blah blah deeply-moving we miss you blubber sniff sniff crap that's not only so sickening, but in many ways so self-serving. You know the score, so do some private homage yerself and while yer at it lift a can of Pabst in his memory or something equally appropriate.

A year later I am still slight depressed, but not in a dangerous way. I have not had a manic episode, been suicidal or psychotic in a long time. I struggle every single day (hour) with sobriety, sometimes more successfully than others, but I haven’t been drunk in more than two months and haven’t had a sip of wine in a month. I am seeing a great psychiatrist who listens and understands. I think he has me on close to the right medication mix (and fortunately is remarkably limited and relatively side-effect free) and I have been diagnosed as bipolar. I have an excellent physician and have just met a good therapist. I have a supportive family (who didn’t abandon me over the past years despite everything I did to encourage them to).

Highly recommended, very much a worthy sequel.

For Batman’s fifth episode, Gardner Fox inserted a pulp-standard fiancée, Julie Madison, a character even Batman forgets after Robin debuts a few issues later.

Yet they have consistently failed to step up to the mark on behalf of the people of Abergavenny.

Training for Rocky went very well, this year. All of my runs were “quality” runs. I usually only run five days per week, and on some weeks only four days, depending upon the mileage I put-in on the weekend. Most of my weekends have two high-mileage days. That’s the only difference between training for a marathon or for a 50 to 100-mile ultra, in my opinion, is the two-long-runs on weekends.

If Indianapolis plays with the fervor and passion they did last year in the Monday night drubbing of the Patriots they will go to their first Super Bowl. They will permanently end any talk about NE owning them on any level or at any venue. And really, there should be no additional pressure on Indy, because what if they lose? They simply are back to the same spot they've been for years. It doesn't get any worse.

The proposed DSM-V changes will enhance societal prejudices against autistic traits and abilities. These prejudices already serve to prevent autistics whose traits and abilities are more obvious from being considered able to learn, to communicate, to make decisions about our lives, to walk around freely, to be employed, etc. Under the proposed DSM-V changes, autistics who are highly and obviously atypical would be even more harshly judged, without there being anything approaching a sufficient empirical rationale for this. Autistics whose communication and social interaction is highly atypical, or who most strongly pursue their focused abilities and interests (something which has widely been acknowledged leads to good outcomes, but has largely not interested researchers; Howlin, 2005), will now be at risk of being regarded as “most severe.” This is at a time when the term “severe autism” is popularly equated with low expectations, hopelessness, dread and horror.

It's really my hatred of hives and asthma that makes me do it, not cats.
We clashed, time and time again. Both of us being girls and both of us being stubborn and thinking that we knew best, our personalities came to blows more often than not.
6. I found two rings I loved hidden in a kitchen cabinet. I remember taking them off before I went to Honduras four years ago and hiding them "somewhere a robber wouldn't look for them" if I was burgled while I was gone. Apparently I picked a good place because I certainly couldn't find them. On the other hand, if burglers wanted my 10 year old TV bad enough to drag it out of the house without my 90 year old neighbor noticing they were welcome to it.

Cutting note: If you are going to be cutting along straight lines, cut against a metal ruler or metal-edged wooden ruler. Your craft knife may get caught on the edge of a wooden or plastic ruler and nick or damage the edge. When cutting with a metal ruler, be careful to keep the sharp edge of your blade from scraping against the metal. This might damage the blade. Try not to push too hard on the ruler when cutting, as it may stick the tone down where you don't want it to go.
What unfurled is a title that felt reminiscent of an early David Gemmell title with a dark anti-hero leading the way dispensing justice in any manner he saw fit. It’s got a great premise, a solid arc and perhaps best of all a style that fits in well with the type of book that modern readers are seeking. Add to this decent prose and a pace that really doesn’t let up from start to finish and the reader really is in for a treat.
The track through the wood is dead straight, and at some point in the past has been excavated so that its surface is a few inches below the level of the surrounding woodland floor. This, plus the linear alignment shown on the map – Roman? – leading to what appears to be a lozenge-shaped earthwork (as well as the presence of other neolithic sites in adjacent Denge and Eggringe Woods) arouses my curiosity and I press on.
This might sound easy but when you consider that Craft has 21 keg pumps and 16 cask pumps I could end up getting er...wrecked!
It's the faces that really get me with these - you can't help but look at them and wonder what the person did that landed them in trouble, and what their histories and personal stories are... It's a whole different vibe than what you get from most vintage photographs, that inherent element of mystery makes them just that much more interesting!
I am exhausted with the amount of time the picture loading has taken and will have to do a part 2 for the rest of the pictures! I can't wait to share the rest of my Creative Estates Experience with y'all!
Published in 1920, the song was already a popular tune as sung by Vaudeville comedian Bert Williams — an African-American who, in one of the bizzare twists of minstrelsy, regularly performed in blackface. He wasn’t the only one. But he was the only one WC Fields is said to have called “the funniest man I ever saw.”

Anyone who has read this blog regularly knows that my Momma is one of those rare women who can do anything she puts her mind to doing. She is 80 years old now, but it wasn't so long ago that you might find her on the roof fixing it if it needed it.
So unless you understand the nature of fear and are completely free of it totally, your gods, your escapes, your doing of all kinds of social work, and so on, have no meaning because you are then a destructive human being, exploiting, and you cannot resolve this fear.

I sense that the Government may be about to create a tidal wave of opportunities to motoring lawyers like myself with regards to technical legal and scientific challenges in drug driving cases.
When I opened the door, the man standing there took off his sunglasses and introduced himself as David Oleski, I was too dumbfounded to respond. Unfortunately, due to my dumbfoundedness (?), I don't think I gave the shocked/amazed/overwhelmed/THRILLED reaction that Mr. 12 d might have hoped for... but, I was! Totally floored.
If Obama was the CEO of a major corporation, the board of directors could get rid of him. We, the stockholders in America, are stuck with him for three more years.
“Nope.” Natalie shook her head, then stuffed the animal in the seat pocket in front of her. “He was mine before he was yours. Now I want him back.” Not true, of course. She outgrew her attachment to that stupid animal before her sister was even born. Lucy, on the other hand, loved old Crunch. She didn’t care if he was missing an eye, or crusty brown stains spotted his fur. Despite her bounty of newer stuffed animals at home, Crunch was the one she hauled everywhere.

I am kind of overwhelmed today.
But I remember the fighting. It wasn’t often but it was loud. I remember Dad moving out, then a few months later moving back in. I burned my hand on the light bulb trying to take it out and put butter on it to soothe it. More fighting. Then I remember Mom picking me up from school in the middle of the school day. I was 12. There were suitcases in the car. My baby sister Kim was strapped in the back seat. We left. I never got to say goodbye to my friends.
This is a compilation of images from tombs in Egypt and Oaxaca, Mexico that relate to the specific afterlife beliefs of each respective culture. The Egyptian examples focus on what is needed to get into the afterlife and convincing the gods that an individual belongs. In contrast, the Oaxacan examples focus on convincing the ancestors to keep watch over the family after an individual is gone.

Playing online poker has got much more benefits, than playing in a poker room, with the traditional rules. The best thing about playing online poker game is the excellent bonus options available. Online poker games bonuses are now being provided by online poker games web pages to benefit their players. From a legal viewpoint, online poker may differ in some ways from online casino gaming. However online poker is legal and regulated in many countries including several nations.
Or am I just being naive?
Following Mimi's tutorial for two tone gradient nails (you simply must check it out, her nails always make my jaw drop), I managed to create an orange and hot pink gradient look.
Ds1's culinary experimentations this week stretched to raspberry jelly with overcooked chocolate topping. Like me, he got impatient with the microwave and found out that if you heat chocolate high enough and hard enough, after the melting stage comes the solidified gunk stage (fractionally before the setting off the smoke alarm stage). I thought the fresh raspberries from the garden were a nice touch. I didn't ask how much he'd touched them before he put them on the top...particularly when I looked at his black fingernails.
and bitch that we did not “spend any time together” well duuu!! you moron.. I have no desire to “spend time” with a drinking jackass. Then he bitched that it cost him 2 days work.. trying to blame me!!
I was very glad that I had Mr. Swartz in the morning, as the buildup of afternoon heat in his second floor classroom, coupled with his droning voice, led to many a snoozing student and subsequent yardstick whack-on-the-desk, and I wanted no part of that. I much preferred to do my afternoon snoozing under the ever-watchful eye of my blind-as-a-bat English teacher, Miss Thompson.
I copy your writing from some site and I translate it. Fast. Without thinking. And it gives me a hard-on, the fact that I´m able to do it. Without thinking. Heee…
The German double-tracked system of litigation suits held at the lower and upper district courts on the one hand and a parallel nullity suit at the German Patent Court and the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) on the other hand is facing changes. The former practice of the district courts to stay the litigation procedure until the ruling in the nullity procedure has reached legal force is gradually superseded by an accelerated practice of deciding on the infringement without waiting for the ruling in the nullity suit in cases where the district court holds that the invalidation of the patent is improbable.

Three years ago, I was mostly a behind-the-scenes guy who linked to stuff on a very popular website. I always wondered what it would be like to enter the public realm to fight for what I believe in. I’ve lost friends, perhaps dozens. But I’ve gained hundreds, thousands—who knows?—of allies. At the end of the day, I can look at myself in the mirror, and I sleep very well at night.

The planes in the airshow were fairly typical for Chino, but the guy in the little red Team Oracle aerobatic plane had everybody on their feet and cheering. One of the most impressive displays of flying prowess (and power-to-weight ratio!) I've ever seen.
Finally, Babar abruptly married his cousin, which I'm pretty sure is illegal in some states. That was after seeing her naked and being shocked by her lack of clothing. The end.

Particularly smiley morning, too: exchanged some goodbye-smiles on the outbound platform, then smiles in line at the coffee shop, and a couple more on the walk to campus, and some to myself, thanks to a couple of songs that have been on infomusical-device repeat for the past few weeks.
Many times I have heard that God wanted me to feel joy now. Before my prayers were answered. I didn’t see how. I couldn’t wrap my small brain around it all. Many times people have prayed. God heard.

Once the book goes through, they will start asking questions. When is the best time to publish? Who are the competitors? Peg against them or not? Prize-winning potential? Package/Branding? Advertising - bill boards or word of mouth?
One of the most important characters in the David Mapstone mysteries is Phoenix, so filming it to capture the true sense of the city would be critical. Much of the city is flat and low-rise, so camera angle is important. Yet there are also mountains, a skyscraper corridor, Mapstone’s historic neighborhood and all the sleazy parts of town, from the linear slums to rich-trashy Scottsdale.

After the meeting, Anna stops Jae Hyuk and calls him laughable. Before he can react to her, Ga Young walks up, wanting to talk to him. Seeing Jung Ah and Madam Jo behind, he tells her he’s busy right not and they’ll talk later. Jung Ah non-accidentally bumps into Jung Ah on her way. Ga Young returns to her office to find the ladies gossiping but disperse when they see her. Jung Ah walks up to her and asks her how she managed to get into this office, asking her what exactly she did to ‘her Oppa’ while she was away. She drives in a few barbs about Young Gul as well but Ga Young doesn’t pay her much heed. I love how defiant Ga Young is in her answers. They’re interrupted by a call for Ga Young. Next, Ga Young is being led away by Assistant Kim to a special room hidden from everyone’s eyes but Jung Ah manages to see them. Jae Hyuk is happy to see Ga Young and invites her to sit while he’s relaxing but she tells him this isn’t really a place to talk about work. He cites his reasons for calling her here and tells her to just come out with it, his mood now dampened.
I finally got off the phone with them and went down to one of our IT dudes, Jim. Jim's awesome, and he was able to get some of my contacts back via reconnecting my phone with Outlook. But the vast majority of them are gone. Poof. And because I am old (see paragraph 1), I don't know anyone's phone numbers anymore. They're committed to my phone rather than to memory. I guess I'll spend the next year or so reaccumulating them...along with the addresses and whatnot that were also in my phone before The Big Wipe.

I was a little disappointed after cheerfully shelling out admission for myself and four kids, that I then had to pay for separate tickets for almost every activity the kids wanted to do--I must have missed this somehow in their online advertising. I understand there was fundraising to be done, but I don't normally carry a lot of cash, even for bouncy houses and face painting.
Therefore, I did not visit computer land yesterday at all. I trust you all got along well without me, though I know that I was missed. I do! I realize the world goes on without me, but not as perky.
This apparently is the creative energy and the sweet spot. Kryon later adds: “Following your contract places you in perfect alignment.”
It's got odd water marks, light discoloration in patches, scratches, and claw marks from when I try to push my cat, Beefy, off after he knocks down a glass of water on the side table.

We thought the train would be a calm relaxing experience. They would all be contained of course. Not so! It was all the 4 of us big people could do to keep their sippy cups and gold fish crackers from being hurled out of the train car. It took great strength to keep them in their seats. It was musical chairs on steroids!

Dana escapes, but back at the lab everyone is going nuts in a wild celebration, popping the alcohol and cranking the REO Speedwagon. The techs explain that it doesn’t matter if Dana escapes at this point because the virgin death is optional; all that’s required is that she suffers. We can see Dana getting choked on the screens behind the techs, but no one is even watching. No one is paying attention to anything until an ominous red phone rings. Steve answers it and is surprised to hear that someone survived.
Satan took his seat. He began to rule in the church, and this is the language used to describe Haman. Haman was promoted, he was advanced, and his seat is “above all the princes” who were under King Ahasuerus.
No one in the state house would be interested in providing for families of IT engineers if one of us should die "on duty." We don't have a lobbying group pushing for it.
The stadium decision comes after local media reported last month that FIFA had a back-up plan for the World Cup if South Africa did not meet its requirements, raising concerns the country might not stage the event due to construction delays.

***Fun pastime for trying to understand the homobigoted perspective: step 1: find at least one video involving same-sex intimacy as suit your comfort level – even just a clip of Mitchell and Cameron (Modern Family) kissing will do fine. Step 2: find a similar number of videos from movies depicting catastrophic disasters – things like 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow are ideal. Step 3: watch all of the videos in alternating order – one from the first group, followed by one of the terrible repercussions depicted in the second group. For bonus subtext, follow a lesbian kiss with the bit from Return of the King when Sauron’s giant mighty tower fractures and explodes. Step 4: realise with growing horror that some people may actually believe that this is a legitimate concern. Step 5: realise with even more horror that there are definitely people with serious sociopolitical power who want you to believe this is a legitimate concern because it will keep you distracted while they steal everything you own, and sometimes they are succeeding.
I had traumatic water experience in Cebu. The water I drank come from Metro Cebu’s potable water supply and it didn’t came into my mind that the water was unsafe. But I got diarrhea, so it must not always be safe.
In a small saucepan, add pasta and milk. Bring to simmer, then reduce heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, until pasta is soft, stirring frequently and ensuring milk does not boil.

Florence was strip searched after his arrest on a warrant for an unpaid fine, even though the fine had been paid. The court majority rejected Florence’s suggestion that new detainees who are not arrested for serious crimes be exempt from strip searches as “unworkable,” noting that the seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband. In a dissent for the court’s more-liberal members, Justice Stephen Breyer said, “I cannot find justification for the strip search policy at issue here-a policy that would subject those arrested for minor offenses to serious invasions of their personal privacy.”
Mr. Natural's Organic Nut Brown: (**) Bland; none of the flavors really grab me; super light maple flavor; little aroma; not bad but the flavors need to be more pronounced; it is an organic beer... whatever the fuck that means.
OMG Caitlin Flanagan you are too correct that is totally why teenage girls are fucked and freaky. Very observant. It's like the character in Wittgenstein's Mistress menstruating on every page. All I thought about as a girl was my new potential for childbearing.
These scenes are described in horrifyingly vivid detail, but just when readers think the level of human depravity couldn’t possibly worsen, it does. Some forced laborers, whose bellies had become distended through famine, resorted to cannibalism, for which they were killed. Pond was forced to bury the bodies in an ever-growing pile. Then, when the Vietnamese invaded and Pond was forced to become a soldier for the Khmer Rouge, he too became a killer.
In order to help John to come to a proper spiritual assessment of who He was, in the spirit, Jesus, told John’s disciples to look at circumstances through a different perspective, God’s perspective, and see the Kingdom of God being manifested through His ministry. “Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them. And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.” (Matt.11:4-6) (cf., Is.35:5 ff)

A close friend has a smoker and we are planning on making sausage this fall and building a hanging/drying cage in his basement. mmmmm I’m so geeked to make sausage been so long, we may build a cold smoker ans well. I used to make cold smoke seafood sausage way back in my culinary youngness.

I had a Future Shock I wrote published in 2009, which I still find mind-boggling. I write interviews for the Judge Dredd Megazine. My experience of Tharg and his minions -- minimal. I try to deliver my copy on time and keep my nose clean. And, apart from that, I keep out of their way. They're busy droids, who don't need me hassling them.
Our favorite lunch stops are the places that offer factory tours. We have tasted wines in California, toured lumber mills in the northwest, watched them make steel and assemble automobiles in the midwest, toured textile mills in New England, visited cigarette factories in the south and sampled beer in St. Louis.

How many times have we seen this in real life? Think of all the people who make decisions based on a desire to get rich, and “pierce themselves with many sorrows”. There are hundreds of examples, from the people who choose careers based on the money and are chained to working 80 hour weeks at jobs that aren’t fulfilling, to gambling addicts, to shopaholics, to plain old thieves–the list goes on and on. But we also don’t want to react in fear to these possibilities, and run away from money. We need to start with being content and accept whatever God has for us, learning how to steward the amount He has given each of us. I used to think it was wrong for Christians to be wealthy, often hearing Mark 10:25 repeating in my head:
Pattern review seriousness:This was easy-sneezy. Great pattern to work with- I think I need more. This documents me officially swearing off fusible interfacing- much ungainly bunching. I chose some lavendar butterfly buttons to conflict with its slight military edge and because I’m just a pre-geriatric toddler at heart. I will definitely do this pattern again- I like the wide neckline and the sweep of it. My clothing test tends to be ‘Hmm- can I see myself in Disney in this?’ yes, yes I can.

Homicide, the paramount crime and the recipient of more investigative resources than rapes, robberies, or property crimes, grants its investigators something of a head start. It's common to see the blue-gloved employees from the office of the medical examiner bagging evidence while the victim, listed as "likely," still draws breath in a nearby hospital. Once they expire, the file officially becomes a homicide but detectives have already been assigned and the investigation is already underway.

The moves — announced by Gen. James F. Amos, the Marine Corps commandant, in a message sent to all Marines on Monday night — are intended largely to study how women perform in formerly male-only units, and reflect new Pentagon rules released in February allowing women to serve closer to the front line.
“Fourth, Macro-evolution purports that evolution happened over long periods of time without transitional forms in the fossil record. If evolution were true, there would be numerous transitional forms of human like in the fossil record that would, to some degree, reflect the evolutionary chart that many were subjected to growing up in school.”
