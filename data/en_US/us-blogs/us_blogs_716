These stemmed fabric flowers at Snowy Bliss are sooo cool. I'm definitely going to make some for my dining room table...Or the bookcase in my hall...Or maybe both haha!
Anyhow, I was asked to make two 70th birthday cards, one being a handbag themed card from the grandson. Here's what I came up with, pleased to say that the recipient was very happy.....phew, I always dread handing the cards over just in case they hate them....lol!!
The black and white cookies are gorgeous cakey pieces with sweet frosting on top, and everything else looked divine. But there was only so much I could sample in a sitting. Oink, oink.
This morning started off innocuously enough, I suppose. M got that piano toy from my Great-Aunt Virginia. She's had it for almost a month now, and has finally started showing some interest in playing it without prompting. I was a little concerned, since she loved her other piano so much (RIP yard-sale baby piano. You were great while the batteries lasted. Perhaps we'll pull you out again for J to play with) but she seems to have finally gotten the hang of it.

As Bible-believing people, let's also make this Friday a day of prayer – and please encourage others to participate with you. We know that our contest is with spiritual forces (Ephesians 6:12), and we firmly believe that He Who is within us is greater than any other god or force (1 John 4:4), so I encourage you to fill America with prayer to the True God this coming Friday.

Adidas Marathon 10 Women. These are actually reaching retirement sadly (I might just get another pair if I can find them). They are a great distance trainer. I wore these on almost all my long runs during marathon training. I don’t typically race in the them even though they’re really nice and light. I got these on sale at CitySports for around $50 (originally $80).

Once off the ferry, Mr. H had the challenge of adapting a right hand drive car to a left hand driving situation. I admit, it was more challenging for me than him. I sat in the center of the road, gripping my seat for dear life and while he drove hugging the curb. Once we realised that this was an everyday occurrence on European roads we settled right into a natural rhythm and I finally managed to let go of the seat.
Well another 2.7lbs off and another 3.5 inches gone from my bust and waist, which means I have lost 12.5% of my body weight so far! I’d definitely say that I have achieved a lot more than I’d hoped for on this Fast Track Challenge. Admittedly, I haven’t followed the Menu Plans strictly, but they gave ideas on how a balanced meal should look, and the portion sizes were a revelation. Eating more vegetables, nuts and dried fruit has improved the quality of my snacking and bulked out my meals in a less detrimental way than adding more carbs.
Monday saw us get together with my family for lasagna. Not your usual Thanksgiving dinner, but none of us care what we eat... we just like to hang out together! My two great nieces were very wound up (they are 8 and 5) and kept us very entertained. The 5 year old handed out fake $100 bills, which she then proceeded to collect from us for some very pricey "popcorn" she was making using yellow game pieces. She's going to be a shyster when she grows up! The 8 year old spent a lot of effort trying to convince her mother why she shouldn't have to eat any more veggies but should get an extra piece of cheesecake. We all agreed she's going to be a solicitor.

RELEASE DATE: June 8, 2012
The Dhak Dhak diva will play the role of a female Gangster, more of a Grandmother-ish role in Gulab Gang. A film that is inspired by real incidents where gangs of women fight against social injustice will mark the debut of Soumik Sen as a director. No points for guessing, the women based inspirational movie will be released on International Womens Day that is on March 8 next year.

The flawed provisional constitution and canons of the Anglican Church in North America, the even more flawed draft constitution and canons, and Rodgers’ defense of these documents may have been the last straw. My investigation into the sources of a number of provisions in these documents pointed to the Anglican Mission and to its sponsor, the Anglican Church of Rwanda. It revealed that the Anglican Mission’s own canonical charter as well as the Rwandan constitution and canons incorporated not only the language of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law but its doctrine, norms, and principles. These three documents were apparently the work of Anglican Mission Canon Kevin Donlan, a former Roman Catholic priest who studied canon law at Cardiff University. Donlan served on the GAFCON Theological Resource Group and the Common Cause Governance Task Force and is known for his strong Anglo-Catholic leanings. He recently presented the fourth global South encounter with a proposal for revamping Anglican ecclesiology. If this proposal were anything like the Anglican Mission’s canonical charter and the Rwandan constitution and canons, it would replace Anglican ecclesiology with Roman Catholic ecclesiology.

This is the ultimate breakdown of your story. These are the most important points in your story, no matter what genre you write. Funnily enough, when I first get a story idea, what comes to me first is the crisis point then the what ifs start happening. That’s when I dig some more to get the beginning of the incident/story. Everything else in the plot arc of a story is just padding of these three plot points.
The wonderful thing about this challenge is that by the end of the month there's going to be a whole range of different skirts that will suit different shapes and sizes. So if you're looking for the perfect skirt pattern to suit your own body shape, I'm hoping that this will be a great resource.
I was still living at home with my parents in Maryville, Tennessee while attending the university in Knoxville. One of my favorite places to go any time of day was the Foothills Parkway, at that time a 16.5 mile stretch transversing Chilhowee Mountain going from the town of Walland to Chilhowee Lake. Foothills Parkway is still mostly unfinished, but should one day extend a total of 71 miles all the way to Interstate 40 near Cosby, Tennessee.

After the picture concluded there was another guest – Patricia Ward Kelly, Gene’s widow. Va va voom – 46 years his junior, Ward Kelly was Gene’s third wife and now manages the Gene Kelly Image Trust. I saw a lot of negative press online about Mrs. Ward Kelly, but I can only say that she was positive, professional and very engaging with the public. She read a few fan letters and hipped us to her side of Debbie Reynold’s less-than-flattering anecdote without being petty. I really enjoyed hearing her speak twice (also as host to the Cover Girl screening earlier in the week). She said anyone is welcome to friend her on Facebook (Patricia Ward Kelly) to ask questions about Gene and that she answers every message.
And for those of you who don't follow me on Twitter, here's a perfect example of all of the above: Face All Red, a short webcomic by Emily Carroll. The comic uses rhythm, repetition, and simple but powerful sentences to an absolutely chilling effect. It's like a campfire story with illustrations.

I have plans for a new bunny similar to the one I use as an Avatar in most places (Pieris). The thread used for them is discontinued so my supply is limited now, but I haven't done one like those in a good while and I think it's time to make another. Probably a bear too. The thread is very 'slippery' and I'm still dealing with some tendon pain in my thumb from when I fell earlier this year. This makes working with that thread more difficult so this might take a bit of time to get done, but it's in the works!
Details from that point on are fuzzy. I remember accompanying a classmate over to some girls apartment. I remember him rousting me awake from the comfy confines of a beanbag chair, and the next thing I remember was my alarm going off at 7 AM for my 8 AM class.

On Sunday, I hit the downtown location, and had a great workout: after warming up, I did 35 minutes of weights, 5 minutes of rowing, and 17 minutes on an elliptical. But my Saturday workout at the northwest location is the momentous one, because it was during that workout that I reached TWO big milestones.

I am amazed and thrilled that it won, I don’t really consider myself to be a writer, I just write things down when they come to me as a form of recording them and organising my thoughts.

It is much appreciated.
Fernando Torres, with his goal, has apparently repaid in full the £50m Chelsea kindly gave to us for his services. I don’t know what Chelsea get for progressing from the semi final to the final but I’m willing to bet it’s nowhere near that figure. Also, in all the histrionics, it was forgotten that if Torres had not scored, and score stayed at 2-1, Chelsea would have still gone through!

The interesting thing is that over time bizarre becomes the new normal. If you don’t believe me, take a look at how the truly painful characters at work are at home. Don’t be surprised if they are very nice people indeed – when not at work.

Alfie Ambrose (A): I met Mahoody in a Hermit’s cave, Ben in a disused toilet factory and I met John Sterry at an English civil war re-enactment down in Wentworth, It was horrible day and when I got there I realised that I had got the date wrong, Viking re-enactments were the weekend after, I thought I looked out of place until I saw a Roman centurion walking rather sheepishly toward me, turned out this joker had got the day wrong too. We wasn’t allowed to take part but they said we could watch, so over a cup of hot chocolate we got to know each other and although we were dressed quite differently, we had a lot in common. I had already met the other two so everything just fell in to place after.
Ah, I hear you say, but what about dirt and sweat? Leave aside the view that some surfaces actually benefit from the oil in human skin, the best protection against those dangers is washing (and drying) your hands. Clean dry hands are the perfect tools for turning pages or unrolling scrolls. If your hands are made dirty by the document itself (if you're lucky you may be consulting something few people have seen for centuries, and those things can be pretty dusty) you can wash again. How many changes of gloves would you need to keep that white cotton clean? Cotton picks up dust and grit in no time. It spreads it across the the paper.
No h-way. Magic items are not for sale. Well at least not to buy. If it fit the needs of the scenario I might consider a low level item but it would have a specific purpose and wouldn't be a long-term thing. Otherwise, if you want something, go research and then adventure for it.
I’d love to say that this is going to stop, but it will have to wait until next holiday because right before I realized how I was feeding into this, I ended the day by telling them when Independence Day was. So now they’re asking for that. I’ve done it to myself. And, boy, do I start early. I forget that they have memories that stretch on forever, and a quick fix to halt the bed time tantrum when they know magical fun Easter is about to end (and they really didn’t have magical fun, but they didn’t care…it was the heralded, the anticipated, EASTER), the throwaway sentence about the next holiday to look forward to, is what’s setting this unwieldy ball of angst into motion.

northwestern part of the United States with my wife and infant son. I enjoy telling stories, especially when they include fantastical elements of some kind. My favorite part is developing a storyline. There’s something about connecting the dots of a plot to make things work that gives me a high. My favorite book series is Stephen King’s The Dark Tower, I also love the Harry Potter book series, enjoy music and playing guitar, am adopted, and I routinely toss pennies on the ground so that kids and superstitious people can find them and have their day brightened.

Spire Publishing do have three on line bookstores, (UK, USA and Canada), but all their ‘buy button’ links are directed to Amazon affiliate sites. There is just one featured book link on their main webpage, suggesting that they are very much author-traffic driven. They also feature a publisher’s blog and forum, but these are infrequently updated and visited suggested by their low title range (see Amazon title totals above).

Yesterday I was at the grocery store with Children 1 and 2. Child 1 really likes to walk/run down the aisles and watch the food go by out of the corner of his eye, so I'm used to having to tell him to watch where he's going and such. He was walking down an aisle, and there was a woman crouched down, inspecting a can of something. He stood right in front of her, too close, and waited for her to move away. From the other end of the aisle, where I was stuck behind Child 2 and a bunch of other people, I started yelling to him "Child 1. Go around her, please!" But he didn't, he just stood there. She eventually got up, with a really annoyed expression on her face, so that he could pass.
The programme for the day kicks off with a keynote address by Professor Emeritus Richard Johnstone OBE. Other sessions include:
I've been blogging for 8 years and frankly, I needed a break. From time to time during the past months, I've signed on blogger with the intention of writing, only to stare at a white screen and a blinking cursor for hours. It would seem I simply misplaced my writing mojo. Of course, it's not that simple, is it? Writing comes from a creative pool inside me. Unfortunately, my 'pool' was experiencing a drought. Not only did I not have the ability to write, I didn't want to. For the first time in my life, I had no inclination to write. Even still, I'm struggling.
About a million years ago when I was in school I took a print class where we carved our own blocks and then used them to print. I didn't really take to it. In fact, I hated it. I'm not certain if it was me, or the instructor or a combination, but when I finished the class I pretty much swore I'd never carve again. But then a few years ago I came across a book by Traci Bunkers called "Print Stamp Lab" and it got me thinking that maybe I'd like to try carving stamps instead of linoleum blocks. After some trial and error I discovered I actually like carving stamps.

Called a "grade A killer debut" by one major daily, Scars' music is different from the chaotic/alt/metal sound of System of a Down, the Grammy-winning, multi-Platinum band that Malakian and Dolmayan were part of for nearly a decade. Scars music is more song-based and showcases Malakian's varied writing style, from the simmering rock sound of "World Long Gone" to the melodic yet desolate "Universe." On the politically-tinged "3005," Malakian proves he is still as provocative as ever with the lyric, "Let's clap our hands for the president and Jesus Christ/And don't forget Charles Manson..." And "They Say," the first track leaked to the public, is heavy, but in more of a 1970s punk fashion. Some of the other confirmed tracks include "Enemy," ""Stoner Hate," "Babylon," and "Cute Machines."

For me it happened around 35k. I wish I knew exactly what really caused the issue. Right now I point to the fact that I wanted to add some plot points to earlier chapters in order to make the chapters I was writing make sense. Now most of my writing friends have said, “Just make a note of it and move on.” But man, my brain just wants to have those details. I imagine it is in order to be able to sell the recall.
February is Black History Month, a time to recognize the many contributions of African-Americans and a time to celebrate the African-American culture. Our communities are becoming more and more diverse every day, so it’s extremely important that our children are taught to embrace differences in race, culture, and religion. This will help the child in all aspects of his or her life: professional, academic, and social.

My kids got to see 9 states and Washington DC on this trip! We drove out of Illinois, across Indiana, across Ohio, through Pennsylvania, down through Maryland, around DC, through Virginia, and into North Carolina. On the way home, we drove across North Carolina, into Tennessee, up through Kentucky, up through Indiana, and back to Illinois. Whew! That was a LOT of driving. More than once, I fantasized about stopping at the nearest airport, abandoning my car, and flying home. With no one to switch off with, driving all that way was tiring. My shoulders are still sore and tense!

I first saw the type of orange peeling machine in the photo for the first time in the West Indies - simple, ingenious, and so much faster than hand peeling. Also, when peeled this way, removing only the outer peel and leaving the white portion of the rind (the pericarp or albedo), an orange can be eaten more conveniently, like an apple. It is said that the white portion of an orange contains as much vitamin C as the flesh. Perhaps the slightly bitter quality of the white and the American penchant for all things sweet prevents more people from eating oranges this way.
Toss the apples in a bowl with the two sugars, cinnamon and pecans. Set aside.

Do remember those guys in college who played lacrosse, branded themselves with their fraternity letters, and nearly wet themselves when Godsmack, Disturbed, and Staind went on tour together? Yeah, well I always thought it would be hilarious if I ever got to witness one of them pitching a business idea in total “bro” mode. Well, thanks to the power of the internet, I know what that is now like and I have to say that it is way more scary than hilarious. In fact, it is so terrifying that I am happily counting down the days to the Apocalypse so that we can rid ourselves of douchebags such as this. The end of civilization and the world as we know it is totally a fair exchange for ridding the world of dudes who refer to each other as “Bro-seph”, “Bro Montana”, and “Bro J. Simpson”.

Last night I had a similar “eruption” to the one I had at work today, only I was laying in bed, face down, and the BBE, bless his heart, got a face full of the horror because the ceiling fan blew it right back on him. We were choking and crying and laughing all at once. The sheer shock that something so rotten could come out of a girl’s rear end startled him, I think. We talk about pooting and stuff like that all the time, but this was beyond the pale. Typically our conversations are relegated to the following:
8. Is it empowering? Definitely not. This belief causes Paul to unnecessarily limit himself. Paul will miss opportunity after opportunity. But if he could get himself to take action, some of those opportunities would pay off. He won’t ask for the date, for the promotion, for the raise, for help, etc. Technically all of these things lie easily within Paul’s power, but this belief will prevent him from tapping that power. Consequently, Paul will lead a far more stagnant life than necessary. His belief effectively makes the possible impossible.

After twelve years together and the idea of having kids had passed, Donald and Georgia cascaded into loving one another, not concerned over their lack of children. However, time passed gently. They found favor in the eyes of the Lord, and God blessed them three times. After being married for several years and totally in love for one another, they created three beautiful children together. Jaxon Phillip, Freddie Mann, and Joshua Peter. They were the cherries on Georgia’s ice cream sundae. The boys made Donald a proud poppa. The family was complete, and the Epperson’s were wonderful parents.
The Wad (or wad and Cup): In handgun and rifle cartridges, there is nothing between the bullet and the propellant, but air. With shotguns, because they often fire large numbers of small pellets, in order to keep the load all together moving down the barrel, there needs to be a solid buffer between the propellant charge and the shot load. That solid buffer was once almost always a few disks of cardboard or heavy paper (and still sometimes is), but for decades now it has frequently has been a thin plastic cup with a thick plastic base. It flies out the end of the barrel surrounding the load, but because it is very low mass, and has a high surface area, it separates from the load within a few yards, falling to the ground (though sometimes if you are close enough to a paper target, the wad will go through the target).

Great piece today by Catherine Ramplell in her Economix blog on the New York Times. College tuition and fees today are 559 percent of their cost in 1985. In other words, they have nearly sextupled (while consumer prices have roughly doubled). What is the real reason behind this increase? We would tend to agree with her opinion that the core of the problem lies with decreasing state funding. Do you think state governments will be increasing spending in the next ten years? We think not, so continue to plan for more of the same in planning for education.
appreciation of good beer during the intervening period; in fact abstinence has made my enjoyment of a decent glass of beer all the more satisfying. Talk about "absence making the heart grow fonder"! I have noticed though that beer prices have shot up, even in the supermarkets! There are still bargains out there, but one must be prepared to look around for them.
Obviously, I'm one of marketing's leading lights and a professional fucking powerhouse, so this hasn't even caused me to wake suddenly and explosively in the night with a sense of oppressive, all-encompassing dread and a very pressing need to shit buckets and buckets of worryingly soupy feculence. I haven't been doing that at all, no way, fuck you, jog on, fuck off, what, me, no way, fucking help me I'm dying, get lost, fuck off.
Of course, we all want to avoid the managerial and professional mistakes of our predecessors, but sometimes that’s hard to do when organizational culture is entrenched. This would be especially difficult for someone like Sheila who has been with an organization for a long time and is now the manager of her former peers.

I've always had an ambivalent relationship with Marley. I discovered his music as a young teen and listened to the Exodus album obsessively. Like many college-aged music fans of the early 80's, a poster of Marley held a place of significance on my dorm room wall. I hoped his visage would convey my belief in the power of music to right social injustice and to mark me as someone whose interest in music extended far beyond Madonna, Michael Jackson and MTV. To me, he was on par with The Clash and The Specials in their unflinching willingness to point out the hypocrisy of those in power who turned a blind eye to the chaos ranging around them. For that, I always give Marley credit for turning me into a "soul rebel."
Beyond the social enjoyment of two students working together, multiple other factors come into play. Commitment is one of those. Two children have commited to do a work together. That means that one student can't simply jump up when they see the snack chair open and say that they are hungry and longer want to do the work. They have made a commitment to do the work with another child and may not abandon that commitment. This develops trust amongst the children.

Short of a smoking gun with his name on it (sorry for the mixed metaphor) it’s hard to see how that answer, could give rise to any case now. He was not denying the payment, strictly, but stating he had no knowledge. Forgetting could be a legitimate reason for having no knowledge.
If I didn't already have a copy, would I buy it? Undoubtedly yes, and not only for its value as a historical artefact, which is not inconsiderable in my opinion. As Adrian Mitchell said, "Hawkins is an unclassifiable, moon-tanned animal who was banned from Noah's Ark and so decided to start his own Deluge." However, if I found it in a second hand bookshop next to Horovitz' Children of Albion: Poetry of the 'Underground' in Britain and was forced (by dint of a lack of cash) to buy one or the other, I'd go for the Horovitz. Horovitz made an excellent job of picking the wittiest and pithiest of Hawkins' fragmentary poems.
Cleverness is plentiful—the human brain is magnificent…except for the wisdom deficiency, which so dependably invites disaster. Cleverness often breeds destruction; wisdom involves nurture, greater awareness and esteem for what gave us life and keeps life going, and utmost respect for the future. Wisdom versus cleverness influences being born into heaven, or hell.

For the future: today I was in the French shop at the end of our street. It is called Degustation (our hood is odd that way: a rubbish car garage smack in the middle of a residential district; a cute French epicerie a short walk from there). Noticed that they were selling cardamom chocolate. I’ll have to buy some for wedding cake trial number three: Earl Grey Chocolate Cake (perhaps with a cardamom note)…
The Driver Responsibility Program, which assesses fees for a variety of driving-related offenses, was passed by the Legislature in 2003 and directed the Department to administer the program. Traffic offenses that carry an automatic surcharge for three years include DWI-related offenses, driving with no insurance, driving while license suspended, driving without a license and accumulating too many points because of tickets. (For example, the fee for a first-time DWI offender is $1,000 per year for three years.) The revenue generated by DRP goes to trauma centers, emergency medical services and the General Revenue Fund. In related news, the Texas Senate just passed legislation today that would require the Department of Public Safety to implement an "incentive" program to let drivers who want to pay off their surcharge up front do so with a substantial discount to provide greater incentives for compliance, and to prevent so many drivers from beginning to make payments then defaulting before the three years are up. The bill was supported by Grits and hospital interests (who helped negotiate the provisions last year in a DPS working group of which your correspondent was a member), so with luck it will earn the Governor's approval and DPS can implement the rules, which were enshrined in the Texas Administrative Code last year but left unimplemented awaiting "direction" from the Legislature. Now that the Lege has provided that direction (and many thanks to Reps Ryan Guillen and Armando Walle along with Sen. John Whitmire for helping push this through), it's time for DPS to move forward and finish the job it began nearly nearly two years ago when this blog first petitioned DPS for rulemaking on the subject.

First, let’s take the side that social media is giving people a false sense of community. This theme of communal consumption helps people connect with those who share similar experiences, but when it comes to bringing a group together, social media cannot be depended on alone. It takes stronger bonds- stable social relationships- to make a real community. That brings us to Dunbar’s number.

We interviewed with Sarah Carlson, a local reporter, for over an hour so it was hard to tell which clips they would use and how they would tell the story in such a short time window. Sarah was amazing to work with, she asked all the right questions and was so compassionate about this story. She is not a woman who has experienced a loss herself, but has always been a big supporter of the March of Dimes and knows other women who've experienced infant loss.

On our last day in Salt Lake City we paid a visit to the downtown area and spent an hour or so mindlessly wandering around Trolley Square. Those of you with a gruesome bent will remember that this mall was the scene of a mass shooting in early 2007. You can get the scoop on the tragedy at Wikipedia. The whole experience was somewhat surreal and only later, while watching a show on the History Channel did I find that many of the stores we went into during our visit were locations that played prominently in the shooting and the shoot out between the gunman and police. But I digress…badly.
I wanted to love Escape from Innsmouth, I really did. Unfortunately, it is somewhat of a disappointment. This response is likely colored by my own expectations and because it is so difficult to find these days, making it more of a quest than a purchase, but for whatever the reason the supplement largely disappoints. Unless you are a Call of Cthulhu completionist or a fervent fan of The Shadow over Innsmouth, I cannot in good conscience suggest you spend $75 to $100 on this book. There are good bits to it, and a Keeper could put in the intellectual elbow grease to make those bits truly shine, but he would be better off saving his money and creating the town from scratch with just Lovecraft’s tale and whatever ideas spring to mind.

So. I have to borrow them. A couple of hours a week borrowed off my working week (they have to be paid back; it's called 'flexi-time'). A few hours borrowed off housework. A few minutes borrowed off bedtime stories (I don't like that one). And the rest - probably about ten hours' a week - borrowed from my sleep.
I have always tried (all discomfort and squeamishness aside) to maintain an open and honest diaglogue with my girls where issues of sexuality and gender are concerned, basing their readiness simply on their questions. If they ask, I answer as simply as possible and if they have follow up questions, I answer those as well. The downside of sex education at this early age is that no, it does not account for individual readiness.. but then again, neither does the media.
By any measure the PACE trials are flawed and are not the result of proper research. Using diagnostic criteria which do not define patients with ME/CFS and which exclude people with neurological disorders means that patients participating in these trials were of a heterogeneous variety – thus making the results completely irrelevant. This nullifies all of this study.
This whole discussion brings Margaret Mahy’s The Haunting, The Changeover and The Tricksters to mind…
I knew I needed to start back in an easy fashion, and nothing is easier than a scarf. I made 3, one for each kid (actually 4 - N didn't like his original so I ripped it out and started over) and I'm fairly happy with how they turned out. The pattern is a riff from the Lion Brand Yarn "2-Color Scarf". I changed it up into a 3-Color Scarf because I thought that a stripe of red would pop the grey and black and that the gray would be a nice foil for the purple and black. Be sure to block your finished creations, especially if you think they're a little crooked or lumpy looking. I soaked them down, wrapped them in a towel and squeezed out the excess water. I spread them out on the laundry room counter and re-shaped so that the edges were even and lines were straight. Straightening out everything when wet does the trick!

Isaacson’s Steve Jobs met and exceeded all three criteria for me. Steve is a worthy subject of a lengthy biography! His early journey could have filled him with enough bitterness to choke any life or creativity out of him. But he didn’t allow that to happen. Instead of feeling anger toward the biological father that didn’t want him and the mother that gave him up, he embraced his adoptive father and mother with lasting gratitude. In an amazing show of compassion, Steve even comforted his biographical mother on her decision when he met her years later. (I wrote a post about that, Thanks For Not Aborting Me.)
We are all very slowly getting better. I'm very glad. If I could get this dratted cough to leave, and get my same energy level back, I'd be in businesses. I'm proud.

Today I have a fun little project creating a ‘Smash Book’. I had no idea what one of these was and had to google it but basically it’s where you have a little book that you use for jotting down ideas, for inspiration, memories and such like.

Enter the smash book, you get to play with your crafty supplies and keep what you make!!!

As far as farm murders are concerned history repeats itself. In certain areas is true. They want to remove farmers from the land or at least use it as an excuse to kill them. Revenge against white farmers in some areas is real. In a recent court case a farm murderer admitted that he killed the farmer because he was on “his” land.
Other than that, I've just been enjoying living in Raleigh again. I was talking to a friend the other day when I mentioned that I finally feel like myself again. Isn't it funny how location can make such a difference in how you feel about life in general? I am loving all the time spent with friends, and that I can actually see them during the week (as opposed to making a 3-hour drive every Friday and Monday morning and living for the weekends). It's the little things, like being able to meet a friend's new and very adorable puppy, attending a school play featuring my favorite twin girls, and driving to the beach on random weekends. I've also been busy making cookies…and LOTS of cookies.

Initially, the actors were reported to have no qualms doing the scenes. Even now, they haven’t expressed any displeasure or disinterest. In fact, it is Ayan who is having a change of mind; the director no longer seems insistent on retaining the intimate scenes. It is learnt that Ayan now feels there’s a visible difference in how Ranbir and Deepika relate to each other. “Though they’re like friends, doing intimate scenes for the camera is a different thing altogether. So if Ayan senses any awkwardness on part of either of them, especially Deepika, in the intimate scenes, then he’d rather do away with them. If that comfort level is not there to be seen on camera, then that could affect the overall chemistry they share in the film,” explains a source.
During his time as a student at Walthamstow College of Art (1959-63), Ian also taught in local schools. It was at Culverhouse Secondary Modern School in South Ockendon that he met fellow teacher Gordon Law. Fuelled by a diet of jazz and poetry, Ian and Gordon would fantasise about making improvised radio shows and films. The Goons were an influence, as was Richard Lester’s The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film (1959), featuring Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.

Taking a lot better care of myself, doing more stretching and avoiding the layoffs was really key.

Yet the observation that music moves us, central to the accounts of the art in both Plato and Aristotle and more or less continuously ever since, hardly seems groundbreaking. Koelsch readily admits that if there is an advance in knowledge here - which clearly there is - then the progress relates to neuroscience more than to music. To the layman, the idea of neuroscience conjures up an almost mythical understanding of the brain, in which all its perceptions, emotions and thoughts can be accounted for in terms of minute, lightning-fast electrical signals between synapses, cortexes and mysteriously named regions such as the nucleus accumbens and the corpus callosum.
I liked the deal for the dinner set and went with: Yamadaya Ramen (everything in it) + Fried Rice + Fried Chicken (4 pcs) for $9.95 + $4.80 = $14.75. (Students can also get an extra noodle or steamed rice for free - how's that for hospitality at Yamadaya?) My Fried Rice ($6.80 on regular menu, size difference unknown) came first: it was a deliciously fragrant and generous bowl - I almost couldn't stop eating, but I knew that I still had two more dishes to come and fried rice is easier to take home than ramen. I got a to-go box for this and had a nice and filling lunch the next day.

What it does explore, however, and explores well, is that combination of fascination and revulsion towards physical violence and sexuality, and how strangely fluid the two can be. Alfredson’s calmer, meatier direction helps draw this out. Towards the start of …Played With Fire there’s a strikingly carnal, bracingly tender interlude between Lisbeth and Miriam, and unlike in the first film, Lisbeth’s bisexuality isn’t just a throwaway gag but a part of her complex identity, and Rapace gets to show at several junctures throughout the film, including here, an edge of befuddled vulnerability to Lisbeth, rather than simple, alien fanaticism. One seemingly off-hand scene carries enormous weight, in which Lisbeth decides to grant Blomkvist access to her apartment via remote control, a metaphorical access into her life she’s never allowed anyone. The film pulls off one nice moment of ironic brutality, as Lisbeth bests two seamy bikers employed by Niedermann, and is next glimpsed riding down the highway, having appropriated one defeated foe’s bike and apparel, in her element as a highway-cruising bad-ass and wearing her enemies’ apparel like a Greek warrior. It’s a brief interlude of liberation for Lisbeth, in between flashback nightmares and her final passion and resurrection where she actively conflates Christ-like parallels with Viking myth. As storytelling, the Millennium series is barely choate and often clumsy; as neo-mythology, it’s something much more

NOTE: Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

This type of discipline and approach attracts me to continue learning and committing to Wing Chun. Yes, self motivation is important (as proven by my running experience), but that extra push, that challenge that you can do better matched with the guidance of a master is something else. When you train alone or learn something by yourself, you lose that humility that you could be doing something wrong. A teacher is there to show you your mistakes and you correct them on your own.

Our little girl can now hear horns honking, dogs barking and more importantly, her mommy and daddy's voices. I've been talking and singing to her all along, but now I know she can hear us. She has also been given a special little nickname. I'm sure you've heard of the Cookie Monster, well this little lady has officially earned the name Kicky Monster. She kicks so much throughout the day! I have to say that I do love it because it lets me know that she is okay.
“Okay, little guy. It’s all good. There’s a pay phone right on front, just to the right of the door.”
#S-18 YA Urban Fantasy with Romantic Elements : THE ALTERAE
You went to two wedding showers for your Aunt Jenna, one at Carol's and one at a tea room. You were positively delightful at both (though they put us in the corner in the tea room, which was a TERRIBLE move on their part, as we were farthest from the door and the walls were covered with hangings...you may have been the first baby ever to attend tea there. Whoops.). You loved "helping" open presents. Well, you loved the tissue paper, at least.

While Sanjay was in a business trip and Kalpana was on her way to Goa for another advertisement shoot, Kalpana helped a little girl out from a deadly organization led by Ghajini who sold out kidneys and other organs from these girls. Kalpana had managed to let the rest of the girls out and sent them to a hospital. Ghajini was too embarrassed with this intervention of Kalpana and planned her dead.
Watching James Moretosh give evidence to the CM&S Committee this lunchtime reminded me of long hours in corporate life spent negotiating with Americans. The syntax, the formality, the deadpan expression, the fish eyes…all the telltale signs were present. But as the session proceeded, I had this vague yet nagging memory from the past of somebody with the same voice, and yet a person who had nothing to do with serious business. And then it clicked.
He’d already asked his boss for the day off earlier in the week. He had made up a fake doctor’s appointment, stating that he had a check-up involving his prostate. For a forty-five year old man that had never really put his health at the top of his priorities, Richard thought that it was believable.
Van Gundy, it turns out, had powers no one (least of all, I’m sure, Van Gundy himself) ever could have imagined. “By positioning Yao as the symbolic victim of the American racial phantasmatic and his refusal to name the race or racism, by ‘mediating’ Yao, in Kundera’s sense, Van Gundy makes possible a discussion about the condition of racial politics as it pertains to African-American players in the NBA.” (p. 48) Try using that sentence as an icebreaker at a party.
Bosses of Pennine Acute Trust, which runs Fairfield and North Manchester General, have launched an investigation.
I never considered myself a doll maker. If you knew some of my online friends from three or four years ago, or maybe longer even, they would tell you I was adamant that I did not make dolls. Now, lately, I seem to be making more and more of them. I love creating unusual assemblage dolls! I think assemblage is so much fun because you have to solve how to put unusual things together.
I just coated a handful of walnuts and Marcona almonds with dark honey from Galicia and roasted them in the oven preheated to 175C (350F) for around 12 - 15 minutes, stirring them around a bit at the 7 minute mark or so. I incorporated these into a few of the mooncakes.
Have a great day, and send us some sunshine, please!
Anyone who has read this thing I do knows I love to make soup. This little beauty is composed of butternut squash, carrots, celery, red kale, onion and garlic, chicken stock I made in January and froze; fresh dill, salt, pepper, barley and some lovely smoked bacon. A little Grana Padano on top and it's good enough to eat.
Yonphyong was struck with artillery shells last year, which I find fairly easy to imagine. Chongwadae is Seoul's No. 10 / White House.

“Reduction of Special Interest Influence – Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to prohibit: (1) national political party committees (including any officer, agent, or entity they directly or indirectly establish, finance, maintain, or control) (officer, agent, or entity) from soliciting, receiving, directing, transferring, or spending money that is subject to FECA limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements; (2) soft money spending (not currently subject to FECA) for a Federal election activity, in general, by State, district, and local political party committees (including any officer, agent, or entity) or by an association or similar group of candidates for State or local office or State or local officials; (3) soft money spending for fundraising costs by any such committee, officer, agent, or entity; (4) national, State, district, or local political party committees (including national political party congressional campaign committees, entities, officers, or agents) from soliciting, any funds for, or making or directing any donations to certain tax-exempt organizations; and (5) candidates for Federal office, Federal office holders, or their agents from soliciting, receiving, directing, transferring, or spending funds in connection with a Federal election, including funds for any Federal election activity, unless they are subject to FECA limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements, or in connection with any non-Federal election unless such funds meet specified equirements.”

Yellow is definitely a favorite color of mine right now. Maybe I'm missing the sun...just a little? I shared the stenciling technique that I used on this card on the Spellbinders Blog yesterday. There is a full tutorial on how I put it all together. And, CARDS Magazine shared this card on their Facebook page yesterday. That was a fun surprise!
Which leads me to what I did accomplish: connecting with other writers. Through blogging, I have built virtual relationships with people whose opinions I respect and whose advice I value as strongly and as deeply as if they were members of a writing group I might meet up with at the local coffee shop. This is the true power of the internet; this is its gift to writers.

Upright had a great bottle release event Sunday and I would like to thank several people. First off, the patient people who showed up to find an unusually long line and the quickly dwindling food and snack table. We certainly didn't expect the crowd that arrived and appreciate the great attitude that most everyone displayed. I'd also like to thank the crew at Ned Ludd for expertly smoking the dry-rubbed pork loin and my friends who stepped in to hand-wash glasses after I pulled a smooth one last week and broke the dishwasher (which just got fixed yesterday!).
“I trust you will, sir,” Dawson replied, “but you can’t be too careful of a cold. My wife’s mother – she lives up in London – was taken ill last week with what she thought was a simple chill; from what we’ve heard it’s doubtful if she’ll pull through.”

But think that his mind’s eye,
Pondering on my post from Saturday about the precious packages my ancestors would have brought with them, I decided to have a look at their travel and migration status: who they arrived with, and whether they had family in the colony. Even this is deceptive because it only looks at their relatives, not at their broader social connections such as people from their home village. George Kunkel, for example, is not known to have had any family here before he arrived, nor did any arrive after him (chain migration) that I know of. However there were quite a few people from his home village living quite close by in Queensland. Did he arrive after them or before? Either way he wasn’t entirely alone, there was the solace of some compatriots.
Ahh, but "who" is not the actual question... "why" is the question. Well, let's see here: DOGS + SOGGY/WET YARD = MUD TRACKS IN KITCHEN... simple math! Nope, still not the answer... OK, how about you said, "let the dogs in" so I did just as you asked... um, still not the correct answer to the question that was implied. Hmmm, how about I let the dogs in, but I was talking on the cell phone and didn't wipe their paws, therefore they left muddy tracks across your clean kitchen floor... that you just finished scrubbing spotless an hour ago... Hey, now I'm on the right track, but... something isn't quite... oh yeah... that I'm going to wipe up again... right now.
Here's what it looks like after a few rows of stitching:
This book was bittersweet at times and how Howard gave Millia those challenges you would have begged for the character to have the happy ending. No ultimate happy ending comes until the very end but still sad. The last chapter Howard writes gives the read hope for what the future will come. Of course as the reader we are left to our own imagination.

They wish to cancel many, if not most, of the laws that promote women’s rights, most notably a law that allows a wife to obtain a divorce without obstructions from her partner. The implementation of the Islamic right to divorce law, also known as the Khula, ended years of hardship and legal battles women would have to endure when trying to obtain a divorce.

In one of the most damning episodes of the criminal history of this family, it was revealed that the personal lawyer of Beatrix, Frits Salomonson, who also was a member of the Committee of Guardians of the crown prince, was the prime whitewasher of the Bruinsma drug-millions, transporting them from the criminal underworld to the ‘legal’ business communities through a criminal stock-exchange listed phantom-company that was only there for whitewashing drugs money.
So the good news for unpublished authors is that, if editors reject your manuscript, then if you are willing to wait two or three years, you will have a (mostly) clean slate to try again.

Angela Hill’s story, published Sunday in Bay Area News Group papers, explores why it isn’t easy being green…in fact it can be downright confusing. What may claimed to be green, when looking at the carbon imprint and the amount of energy used in manufacturing a “green” product may net an adverse impact on Mother Earth. So sometimes when we are trying to be green we may not be…thankfully sometimes we are. The story offers tips and sites where you can go to help make good green decisions.

One regret I have in life was when we were at a certain school ( and new to the area) and I allowed myself for the first time to follow the community I was in and DISLIKE other teams based solely on what I was told ... I wanted to be part of the crowd ... part of the community and I followed blindly ... This was totally my fault and a weakness I had to belong ... Age, wisdom, and a lot of experience has taught me to give everyone a chance first, be kind, and have good sportsmanship ... And what an amazing JOY that is because it has opened up my mind and heart to many new friendships ... I think at this point I can say that I have sweet friendships w/ other parents at all the schools my children play against and I pray this will continue as the younger ones find their areas of interest ...
This is his reply. It does not make for easy reading, but then, this blog was never meant to concentrate on unicorns, pixies and rainbows. This is a place where realities are ripped away and a different truth inserted.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
I hope this doesn’t creep some women out, but let’s be honest here: for men who value friendships with women, most of them would jump at the chance to take that friendship to a more intimate level — assuming there aren’t complicating factors, significant others, etc. There is already a connection that the friendship has been built on, they enjoy spending time with you. You’re also of the opposite sex, and there are human biological needs that both of you have. For these men, getting to be more intimate isn’t about flipping a switch, changing from friends to lovers– it’s about adding another layer, building something deeper on the foundation, being friends and lovers. For a beta man, being in the Friend Zone and the end zone is Nirvana!
Since I know you've missed seeing them...here's a sweet picture of Jib and Puckey for you to enjoy. This is from our first day in Oklahoma visiting Ande's brother and his family. Nothing like a vacation in which your kids need multiple baths a day!! (In other words, they had LOTS of fun!!)
One last change that took place these last couple weeks is that we added two new family members to our household in Tennesee. Dixie and Rambo, our little kittens that we brought back from Jeff's dad's vet clinic. They are definitely a little crazy, but we are already so attached to them, we can't imagine not having them. They are quite the pair, there's really no other way to describe them. :)
The most important part of building excitement is to phrase what you’re doing as something that nobody’s ever done before.

Ironically, on the same day that President Obama was speaking with Robin Roberts, one of my all-time favorite authors, John Irving, was speaking on the Diane Rehm show about his new novel In One Person. (Yes, I'm on the wait list) This interview moved me almost as much as it moved Irving who, at one point, seemed to choke up with his anger and righteous indignation.

So are we going to just roll over and give up? Someone, somewhere wants Mr Wilders and all of us to spout lies on pain of punishment; inconveniently for some, Wilders has decided to stand up and tell the truth, despite everything, even the very real threat of a horrible death.
All too often we believe God and the promises He makes to us. So we ask ourselves, “How is He going to carry out those promises?” We continue by telling ourselves, “If He is going to do it we must do our part.” After all, haven’t you heard that God helps those who help themselves? That is not exactly true. God helps those who put their trust in Him.
It used to be Tuesday, but now it’s Wednesday. Both the day and the quotes part. Wednesday is a little more lax than Tuesday’s so I’m going to post quotes that I find on Wednesdays instead. On with the quotes!
I am not in Paris either, trying to outsing the rumbling of rubber-tyred trains that run underground like blue snakes from one catacomb to another.
So on the one hand, all those wretched women who dare to spend their time and effort working on issues of social justice are dangerously out of line and need to be reprimanded and controlled, and on the other, a man who participated in covering up the rape of children and is still making excuses for his behaviour, is given a position of high authority in the church. He is an “authentic teacher of faith and morals.”

In a world flush with uniqueness
I consider Akito to have a unique blend of traits from both cold and more volatile tsunderes. Even though he’s only 11, he’s quiet and a ‘lone wolf’ who does his own thing. While he’s smart and athletic, unlike Naoki, he’s not perfect at everything. He’s cynical and never smiles, yet he also won’t lie, even to people he dislikes. However, he does have a fiesty side – he has a temper that causes him to kick things (though he’s not as violent as Tsukasa). However, unlike other tsundere love interests, he and Sana feel like equals. Even though he’s popular, she’s one of the few people who understands him and they both can only be themselves around each other. Sana herself is spunky and one of the few people willing to stand up to Akito when he causes trouble in their classroom. Unlike Naoki, Akito does at least accept his love for Sana, and tries to express his emotions the only way he can by saying he ‘doesn’t hate’ Sana. Furthermore, he has a few close friends, and is looked up to by the other guys in his class, so he’s not a complete loner. We can see how his tragic background shaped him into the person he is, who can only see things negatively, and rather than thinking he’s a jerk, we really feel sorry for him.
Thank you for cross posting.
As you can see by these synopses, the staff of YAMATO: 2199 are sticking very close to the original 1974 series, which may alleviate the worries and concerns of some Old Skool fans.

Thank you for all your comments about Spotty on my last post. He has arthritis in his hind legs, and my concerns with his recent stiffness was that it is getting worse. The exercises are helping and he is getting extra supplements with his feed to help. He is only 9 but pulled a cart or trap before he came to the centre. I suspect he was asked to pull a too heavy load and this could be why he has arthritis. As I own him now, I make sure that he receives the very best care and attention. He is one very loved pony!
Journalism appears to have no eye for a story these days. The events of yesterday were not — as the MSM have implied — simply about a few right-wing wackos with an inbuilt hatred of the religion of peace; it was far more importantly about freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, or more succinctly, democracy.

Many people forget that the current WR holder in the 400 (Michael Johnson) started out as a sprinter at Baylor. And that it was through both repeated injury and Johnson's penchant for turning in superlative relay legs in the 4x4 that the move was made away from the 100/200 double up to the 200/400 double. The rest, as they say, is history.

Imagine that you’re playing the popular MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game), World of Warcraft. You and your party are discussing your carefully laid out plan that you’ve put together over a voice chat with your group of players. You’re waiting to go into the next part of the raid, and if you mess up, your whole party will die. Then you’ll have to start over. Suddenly, one of the players yell, “Alright, times up, let’s do this.” He runs towards the entrance, screaming, “LEEROOOOOYYY JENNKIIINSS!” He just messed up your entire plan. This is exactly what happened to the party of Ben Schulz when he made his character thrash into the entrance, completely ignoring the plan and effectively killing his entire party. Also, this meme was featured in a deleted scene of Monsters vs. Aliens. Just so you know.
I know that I promised that I wouldn't do a Royal Wedding post (but focused instead on my love of Treacy hats here), but now that months have gone by, I have to say, my serious girl/style crush on the Duchess of Cambridge shows absolutely no signs of dwindling.
After loading my stuff in the car, I drove to the other 24-hour Walmart in town, with a nagging thought in my mind: What if the second store was out of carrots as well? How far was I willing to drive to find Great Value carrots? Wouldn’t it be a lot less trouble if I just settled for the name-brand carrots that were in ample supply on the shelves, instead of insisting on the Great Value brand? Well, yes, but if the less-expensive generic brand is out of stock and I have to settle for the more-expensive name brand, I’d have to pay more if I really wanted carrots.

Vice Provost Gip Seaver said reclassifying the discipline as a foreign language wasn’t controversial at NIU, in part because it has been accepted at so many other universities.
The quote reads
No one is proposing that all foreign takeovers should be blocked. But we could easily put our own measures into place to limit further damage. There’s nothing wrong, for instance, with having a vetting process for foreign deals that would take into account matters of public and national economic interest.
I remind her that her grandchildren care about her very much, but it has taken these circumstances for the Lord to open her eyes to the truth in her life. I had to see these things myself. One of these people taking advantage of her was also my Godson. So, I’m not that naive anymore.
Next is the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. I read the books and listened to the radio plays and loved them both but for different reason. I’ve chosen these books for their sheer delight in the English language, general silliness and its cast of crazy characters.

If anyone ever does want to know what I've used, please feel free to leave a comment or send an email and as long as I have some way of contacting you back (and can work out what it was that I used etc)...I'll reply asap.
Eventually, the stag scrapes at the ground with a foreleg, turns round, and drops down with an audible grunt-sigh to settle in the tall grass. Through the binoculars, I watch his eyelids droop, then snap open, head twisting, to survey his surroundings before settling once more.

The media pays more attention when bad things happen. Through International Positive Week, we hope to reverse this trend. There are many athletes, leagues and corporations that don’t get the credit they deserve for their good deeds.” I could not agree more, and this is exactly why some of today’s top business leaders are aligning their companies with other like minded organizations who are making a positive difference in the world.

The teen and I chatted and waited for our food. It was a really REALLY nice evening. The teen ate every single bite of his hot dog...he said the tomatoes and onion were the perfect match for the dog, the bacon, and the cheddar. He added a bit of mustard and gobbled it all down! Wow, I was shocked. He ate all of his fries next...then he helped me with my plate.
And was it ever delicious. For a few blissful minutes, maybe even six or seven, Gideon was completely occupied with his yogurt, his granola and his muffin. Rebekah, too; granted, she kept trying to shove scrambled eggs in Grandmother’s mouth, but for the most part, we were able to enjoy our food. But all too soon Gideon uttered those dreaded words: “I’m full.” How a child can be full before their grown-up counterparts can even get through the first biscuit is a mystery, but it is to be expected. Time in a restaurant with a little boy is something like dog years; for every minute we normal people experience, they live seven. So we had only been there for a short time, but Gideon…well he had been sitting for at least three hours. He was done.
Fast forward to later that night, all traces of colour-co-ordinating baseball caps are removed to reveal our glossy hair, though we do still smell faintly of gherkins. We walk into Tom Peppers, the main pub, with it's sticky tables and carpets from all the drinks that have been spilt, and a palpable sense of release in the air as everyone forgets about the day job, and takes advantage of the buy-one-drink-get-one-free offer.
As I do with all banana breads, I also added nutmeg and cinnamon for added flavor. These spices really bring out the banana flavor and work wonderfully in this bread.

“OF COURSE YOU DON’T!” He erupted. His tan complexion was now tinted a beet red. And his once bedroom eyes were warpath wide; hazed by a temper which not only derided me, it made me realize that not only do you not disturb a man when he’s working, you sure in the hells don’t disturb a man when he’s going through the motions. “Cause you’ve never fucking worked a day in your life! And now YOU want ME to “snap” out of my depression? FUCK THAT!”

You literally smear it all over your face and neck and then wipe off with a tissue or a warm wet facecloth. This stuff is so old school, but I LOVE it. Seriously, after using it I wondered why I was worried about breaking out. Normally, we wash all the natural oils out of our face with harsh cleansers, then reapply cream. Why not skip a step? My face is SO soft the next day and the way it removes makeup is unreal. I usually use a liquid based eye makeup remover and always look like a raccoon the next morning no matter how clean I thought my eyes were. This never happens with this cold cream now.
3. Will publishers finally update the royalty statement accounting periods? If eBook becomes primary format, there is no need to be 6 months behind (so as to account for returns according to publishers) in the generating of statements and the paying of royalties earned. There is no reason not to do this monthly.
Last night there was a meeting organised by the Oxfordshire Anti-Cuts Alliance (OACA)specifically about libraries. Conservative-run OCC is planning to close 20 of its 43 branch libraries - or rather to withdraw funding from them and offer them the opportunity to be run by volunteers. Last week I talked on Radio Oxford's Breakfast show with Julie Hayward of the Headington Library support group and Keith Mitchell the OCC Leader about the insult to qualified librarians and users this proposal represents.
The Banana Boat is an aerosol spray. Our kid's daycare at the time preferred it because it was easier and faster to apply to all 30+ kids before taking them out to play. Well, it is a spray...and it lingers in the air after it's been applied. So yes, we are breathing it in. It may be tested to be safe when applied to skin but should we really be breathing it in?? There are a lot of chemicals in sunscreen. I don't know if I want my kids inhaling them!

In order to find out the sexual constitution of the SS women, each is paired with a naked SS man. What transpires next could best be described as a Nazi orgy, as the screen is filled with a glut of uncut penises thrusting in the vicinity of twenty untamed vaginas. After the orgy, the SS women are each put in a room and paired with an individual that the Nazi leadership considers unsavoury. Forced to copulate with amputees, dwarves, the mentally ill, and lesbians, you're either "approved" or "rejected," depending on the quality of your performance. If, for example, you recoil in horror to having your clitoris licked by another woman, you're out. But if you manage to mount the mangled member of a legless man with a modicum of gusto, then you're in. Who else, by the way, was disturbed by Olga's reaction to having her genitals serviced by a professional lesbian? Call me an old fashioned dyke, but I thought she lucked out by getting paired with a lesbian. You'd have thought she had been paired with a troglodytic man-beast judging by the extreme nature of her negative reaction.

Just enough time to get out to PS1 before it closed. Having never been on my previous trips to NYC, I was excited about seeing the building and a show of new works. Building? Cool. Show? Meh. Waaaay too many poorly executed video installations, though there were a couple I liked. There was an overall lack of craft and technique in the show. I love modern, abstract art, but please kids, don't just glue a bunch of crap together (or melt glass bottles and feathers into a slag heap) and expect me to be impressed.
That said, the biggest obstacle is staying motivated, and using time wisely – you know, instead of procrastinating. (Because this isn’t doing that AT ALL.)
Fast forward a few months. After losing Holly, the neighbors turned out their cow and the new calf Boo-Boo. If you all remember our bull calf Buzz, well Buzz slipped through the fence and found himself a playmate. Buzz also self adopted himself to them and even began nursing off their cow. We had to bring him back home and even though we did, he slipped out and down the driveway, going back to the neighbors barn within and hour of his coming home.

H - Let’s pick up on something we spent a long time discussing when we started this blog: our decision to post our first-draft comics pages here. This is primarily a “making of” blog, examining the process of creating a graphic novel (aimed at readers interested in “creative process” issues as well as comics fans) – rather than the kind of comics blog where a final story is presented in weekly installments. Because of this, we spent a good while debating what we should post here by way of comic pages, since normally one doesn't publish first-draft work! However, we realised early on that in order to discuss the ‘making of’ our novel, we'd need to introduce some of the characters and plot lines -- otherwise the blog would be full of story references that readers wouldn’t understand. It would become nonsensical!

Like many studios, Iwerks started with a knock-off Mickey Mouse (his version was Flip the Frog) and tried to impress theatre patrons with dazzling colour a little over three years later. The ComiColor cartoons didn’t impress M-G-M; Powers had to distribute them to theatres through his own company, meaning he was lucky to get into the big theatres, which were all sewed up by the major studios.
While I don't understand the appeal, I love that my kids and my husband have such a good time picking these out. Now they're going to sit on the coffee table for a long time and yes, I will probably get around to reading them too.

Once again I’m struck by how young these folks are. The oldest of them might be in his mid-30s. Are these truly the leaders of a coup that seems to have toppled what had been one of West Africa’s most stable regimes? Or are there more senior figures somewhere pulling the strings? It’s also noteworthy that these troops are rank-and-file, not from special units like the parachute regiment or presidential guard. I wonder how and whether they will be able to command the loyalty of their peers in other military units.
Ordinal-linguistic personification is a type of synaesthesia in which concepts such as letters and/or numbers are involuntarily thought of as having individual characteristics usually associated with people, such as genders and ages and personalities. One the face of it this might seem pretty odd, but the linking of personal characteristics with non-living things is certainly not limited to the arena of obscure psychological phenomena. In our shared culture ships are often ascribed with a female gender, and cyclones are given personal names. One very effective make of vacuum cleaner has a cute face on it and is named Henry. It appears that moving objects are especially likely to be associated with human-like characteristics, possibly because their mobility and agency causes the more primitve and instinctual parts of our brains to “read” them as people or intelligent animals.
Our Father in heaven, may your name be honored, may your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we ourselves have forgiven our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

Lady Gaga came into public consciousness as the queen of the iTunes era, a #1 single factory who people vaguely respected for her musical talent but didn't necessarily want to hear a full-length record from. In 2011, though, her singles campaign for Born This Way did just fine but not excessively well (leaving Rihanna and Katy Perry to fight over the crown), while the album itself held together as a cohesive aesthetic statement about her commitment to both '80s retro and millenial club beats. She's the kind of artist whose albums should feel wrung dry by the end of the promotional cycle, but five singles later it's still full of deep cuts I love.

However, if I wish to wear a football shirt or a hat in my own time I will do so. As it happens I don’t, but I don’t wish to be told that I can’t wear what I like by a publican. I don’t actually own a football shirt. I own a baseball cap. I don’t want to pay £40 for a nylon t-shirt advertising a betting company. I do want, in fact I demand, the right to buy one and wear one if I wish. If the urge ever strikes me I will. I will wear what the fuck I like on my day off.
Of course, my whole analysis might turn out to be completely wrong.
That’s because we dont know how to simply ‘share an opinion’ when we so obviously know it’s rude. Like me. I have called people sluts and bitches and other things (sorry for the language) but I usually say it in my mind. I mean, doyou know anybody who ALWAYS says EVERYTHING that’s on their mind? We all wanna be able to say that’s us! But we can’t because, these days, calling anybody those names is just wrong and mean and should not be done.

Yesterday was a day off from the gym but still an active day. I started with a couple hours of gardening - pulling weeds and planting a few new plants - before getting the kids out the door for some errands. After the errands we went to Whole Foods to meet a friend and her kids for lunch (Hi Michelle!). The cool thing was Miguel was able to come meet us. Always nicer to have the whole family together. I had a burrito with a whole wheat tortilla, chicken, black beans, veggies and salsa. I was going to have avocado too but I figured with the mother's party that evening I should save the calories. I wasn't sure how many points to give it so I went with 10. In reality it was probably more than that.

"All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up."The six-year-old boy was keen to do more sketches! My friend generously allowed the boy to have an extra piece of drawing paper before we bid farewell to him and encourage him to sketch at a later time. These children would probably find it helpful to bring their sketchbooks and drawing materials out with them whenever they are out in Nature. Nature simply inspires.
But my son, he's the friend who sheds light on unanswered questions, on the mystery. He's the friend that speaks truth.

You will see a lot of little things that are good in life when you are sick and feeling like crap. I miss the sound of people beating down chess pieces on a wooden board deep into the night, outside the park in front of our home. I miss the little boys and girls running around and shouting and the babies crying, these common and soothing sounds have been replaced by dog barks and eerie silences. I miss the comfort of sleeping in my own bed and being pampered by my better half when I am sick. The card games played every night at a round table with the family, which have become something of a ritual has left a void. It might not always be the case that we are always together when we are home, but we get solace from the thought that we share a common home. It is always welcoming to know that you are just a phone call or a visit away from your loved ones, and it is disheartening to think that you are thousands of miles away from the care and understanding you need.
Another great TIP I learned:
May you see waiting times as joyful opportunities rather than painful detours to your carefully planned schedule. Besides, when we tell God our plans He probably has a pretty good chuckle at our expense. He is always in control, and he wants us to allow Him to guide our lives so that Jeremiah 29:11 can be fulfilled in us.

But don't sit around and go ON and ON about how exquisite and beautiful the BURLAP is and insinuate that the corset is worth $7k. "It's idealizing a non-profit in a very chic way," says Simon. What? "I'm going to wear it in as public of a place as possible," proclaims Alex. "Opening night at the opera."
Eventhough I am primarily an online gamer, I am always on the lookout for a powerful single player experience. It has a lot to do with the fact that I got back into gaming when my close friend Kostas, after pouring me a glass of Metaxa the afternoon after his civil marriage, handed me over a Dualshock and invited me to play BLACK on his PS2. I got instantly hooked, a couple of weeks later I was buying a second hand xbox1, and the rest is history.

French aerobics class was a myth buster. I learned that some French women do workout, contrary to common belief. But, as my Girl Scout cookie test proved, they can eat a nibble of something and then stop. So maybe French women don’t need to workout as much as Americans because they have restraint when it comes to delicious treats. That is a generalization, of course. Either way, aerobics class was well worth the money.

These Palestinians and Hezbollah, they’re playing this win-win game and it’s depressing to see. If Israel doesn’t fire at them, they’re very happy, and I can understand that. But if Israel does fire on them, and children are hurt, they’re also happy. They celebrate. I believe that these losses destroy the mothers and the fathers. But the community is ostensibly happy: “Great, we’ve got something nasty to say against Israel. Israel kills children.”
Stuckey scoffed at the petitioners' argument, saying that they "primarily base their theory" on a statement made by Forest City Enterprises CEO Chuck Ratner, who told investment analysts the project would take 15 years to build and assented to a statement that the arena would open in 2010.

In 1963, Dr. Bateson was allegedly invited by Taylor Pryor to work under cover of the Oceanic Foundation in Hawaiion cetacean and other problems of animal and human communication. Bateson remained in Hawaii working with the Culture Institute of the EWC. It was during the EWC-HU period that Bateson developed the fourth period – the new epistemology – that stems from systems and ecology.[55] Human “ecology” is a CIA code-word for behavior modification and mind control.[56]

My position is simple and straight-forward. The Magisterium of the Catholic Church explicitly teaches all of the doctrines of our Faith, even the difficult and controversial ones, right up to this present day. But the Catholic Magisterium does not teach geocentrism. Therefore, it is not a doctrine of the Catholic faith.

(c) A stone is barren. You will reap no harvest off rocks of any description. You will never fill your barns with corn from the top of Snowdon or Ben Nevis. You will never reap wheat on granite or slate,–on lime-stone or trap-stone, on oolite or sandstone,–on flint or on chalk. You may get good crops on Norfolk sands, or Cambridge-shire fens, or Suffolk clay, by patience, labour, money, and good farming. But you will never get a crop worth a farthing off a stone. It is just the same with the natural heart. It is utterly barren of penitence, or faith, or love, or tear, or holiness, or humility. Until God breaks it up. and puts a new principle in it, it bears no fruit to God’s praise. Well may the natural heart be called a heart of stone!

We observe the same home-grown innovation in business models. Look, for example, at the online sector, especially Tencent’s QQ instant-messaging service and the Sina Corporation’s microblog, Weibo. These models, unique to China, are generating revenue and growing in ways that have not been duplicated anywhere in the world. QQ’s low, flat-rate pricing and active marketplace for online games generate tremendous value from hundreds of millions of Chinese users.

At the beginning of XXI century more attention was given to reexamination of folk songs. In many cases a coded myths were found. The need to code myths into folk songs was due to persecution of Slavic pagans by the Christians. It’s a mechanism of passing down oral tradition in an form easy to remember, but hard to decipher for those not familiar with the code (i.e. Christian authorities), not unknown in other European pagan religions. To be honest, in case of some folk songs a certain amount of reconstruction needs to be done, because sometimes singers of the folk songs hadn’t been properly trained to pass on the meaning of the symbols used in the folk songs.
The company I purchased my mini computer from was Express PC Parts. I liked how thorough they were with pictures on their website, plus links to manufacturers the parts were from. At a glance, I could see what I was getting and if it was going to suit my purposes. The only downside was it came with Windows Vista that was originally installed on the hard drive. But I deleted it when I installed Ubuntu.
"You should just move or find a new place" Yes, I suppose I could, but I really really don't want to. Movie is expensive and sucks up more money , time and resources than I can afford right now. If I am forced to move I will. However, I have moved three times in three years and I would kind of like to not have to do it again. That's why I have decided to play this game out to the end. It's why I continue to fix things up and decorate knowing I could be asked to leave at any time. I do it for hope. I do it so I can have some peace of mind. THings are hard enough as it is.

In my younger days, I enjoyed many an afternoon in a robust workout on the basketball court. I’ve never had much of a vertical leap and my three-point shot rarely found the hole, but I’ve always been a good ball handler, even perfecting a behind-the-back crossover that frequently left me open for a layup. What’s been hurting my game in the gym lately is that the floor tends to get a little slippery when I have to splash through a puddle of my own urine.
Our lives were on hold that month she was in the ICU following her stroke. The she started getting better, she started trying to talk more and got more responsive. It truly felt surreal. No one quite understands, because it's easy to say, oh you lost faith. No, we did not. I still prayed she would make it through, but when every doctor that came in to see her, said she was going to die since she did not have the surgery and there was nothing they could do for her you process the information and have to accept what is coming. Unless you've been in this situation, there is no way to understand it, so please don't say something stupid like, well you lost faith.

However, none of these things have had such a huge impact on my life as the Oh Henry! Bar. I know that it was not originally produced in Canada (originally from Chicago) but it is widely available in Canada and not so much in the United States. This candy bar is a wonderfully sweet and satisfying bar with peanuts, caramel and beautiful milk chocolate. My wife and I brought one back from our trip to Canada during our honeymoon and finally opened it up and enjoyed it a few nights ago. When I say “enjoyed it” I mean exactly that. I don’t just eat an Oh Henry! Bar, when I bite into one I am filled with that sweet sensation of elation that only chocolate can give you. Until this week I would tell anyone that my favorite candy bar was a Snickers… my world has been turned upside-down. From this day forth I declare that the best candy Bar I have ever had is the Oh Henry! Bar. When I see that beautiful yellow wrapper on the shelf I will do everything in my power to have it again. That is enough of a motivation for me to sit in rush-hour traffic trying to cross the border into Canada and back just to get the sweet taste of that wonderful chocolate again.

When bolshie French President de Gaulle withdrew France from the common NATO military command in February 1966, he ordered all American military forces to leave France. US President Lyndon B Johnson asked Secretary of State Dean Rusk to seek further clarification from President de Gaulle by asking whether the bodies of buried American soldiers must leave France as well. Rusk recorded in his autobiography that de Gaulle did not respond when asked, "Does your order include the bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries?

During the race, the final event of a horror weekend occurred when a wheel departed from Michele Alboreto’s Minardi as he exited the pits from his final stop.

My story has a happy ending. My children are happy, healthy and carefree. My marriage is more solid, more connected and more pervy than every before. The friendships I have been able to maintain are deeper and closer and the new ones I have made have added a richness to my life that I never experienced. I meant it when I said I am the happiest I have ever been, but I would have preferred to have thought about these things prior to that day. I would have preferred to have been prepared. I would have preferred to have not lost so much.

The talent on display that night was amazing. The classically-trained voices, the perfect harmonies, flawless melodies, the skill of the conductors and musicians. It was all very beautiful and moving. It is this kind of night in recent years when I would feel like I wasn’t a singer. I’m not trained. At least I haven’t had a voice lesson since I was in the Woodlands Youth Chorale many many moons ago. And, I don’t sing perfectly. At least it’s not what I consider perfect. I hear the perfect melodies of others, the way they sing with ease and hit high notes that give me chills. I’m amazed and I love it. It’s not me. But, that doesn’t mean I can’t sing.

So we took him up to my wife’s sister house in Sacele they have a massive garden and another dog as well, after a few days he simply loved it up there and it is probably the best place for him. They actually let him roam free out of the garden so sometimes he can be gone for days exploring the woods and chasing the female dogs and making lots of new friends but he always comes back with a big smile, tail wagging furiously and great excitement in his eyes just wanting to tell you about his latest adventure.

That said, I've never seen a finally released copy of The Lemon Men's "I've Seen You Cut Lemons" in my life, and whilst they (apparently) do exist, this acetate turned up for sale so cheaply that it was worth a punt. Frequently labelled by bloggers as a "psychedelic record", it's not so much psychedelia as an unbelievably peculiar ballad. A rich voiced singer croons a gentle melody about mental illness, using the unexpected lines: "You say that I'm mad and should be committed/ And you are the one who should be called sane", "I've seen you cut lemons/ I've seen you burn children and leave them to die". Yes indeed. Perhaps to muddy the waters further, the song also contains the lines: "You ask me if I don't also cut lemons/ I do, but when I do I cry".

The last tenant was someone who Mr BC knew from school, she had lost her home in the Joplin tornado, and was having trouble finding a place to stay where she could have her pets, she had 2 cats and 2 dogs, so we took pity and rented to her. I had not seen the inside of the house until they moved out. Mr BC said the carpet did not smell like that before they moved in, but since it was so old and needed to be replaced anyway (really cheap and very ugly) we did not give her a hard time about the state of the carpet. We just bit the bullet. I am not sure after DD2 moves out that I really want to be a landlord. Since we inherited it, I would like to flip it. But he owns it with his sister, so for now we are all landlords.

Well more than twenty years have flown by and on a good day this is true. But what is also true is that somewhere along the way photography did turn from just “fun” into work.

While they are still reading it (I hope) I’ve also found that I’ve picked up a few Aussie readers (as well as other countries) along the way.
I positioned a band on my right index finger and pulled back with my left hand, aiming for the ceiling. Twang! The cloth-covered rubber shot from my finger tips and thwacked against the ceiling.

The band hit the ceiling near the spider and ricocheted against the wall before falling to the counter top. I shot again. And again. And again.

Territory: Argyle Jnr is territorial over the northern area of the Timbavati, with the majority of her territory falling north of the Timbavati in Ingwelala. In the Timbavati, Argyle Jnr frequents the properties of Motswari, Argyle and the very northern section of Peru (on mostly on the eastern side of the Nhlaralumi). On Ingwelala, Argyle Jnr is the dominant female over their portion of Argyle, with her territory’s northern and western boundaries unlikely to extend too far past Argyle Rd in either direction. The eastern boundary of her territory would also be around Western Cutline, and her southern boundary would be around Sohebele Dam/Sohebele Plains in the east, and Peru Entrance Rd in the west. Argyle Jnr’s core territory seems to be similar to that of Argyle male, and centres on the wedge created by the Nhlaralumi and Sohebele Riverbeds.

All this year, I'm keeping a video diary of everything that goes into writing my third novel, It Started With a Kiss, due to be published on 10th November.

A wonderful birthday.

Even if you’re one of the people who tries to plan their future out ( like myself), you’re going to hit one hell of a roadblock after those four years. Sure, you might know what you want to do–maybe you want to be a fashion designer, a teacher, or a writer–but very rarely is figuring out how to get there that easy. Unfortunately, that’s where me ( and a shit ton of the people I graduated with) are currently stuck. We all have one map with a big X at where we want to be, but we don’t have a clue the direction to head to get there.
Another thing you should research is any author/writing website you can join and use, either for FREE or for a very low price. But, look before you leap. Many sites will seem to give you exposure but end up being so limited it’s not worth it. They may give you a page and the ability to write a lot of material within your page, but the page doesn’t get posted or rotated so anyone gets to see it. People have to be actually looking for YOU before they find your page. Or, they give you a fairly good price to get in, but then anything you want to do costs more, or the annual renewal fee gets you. If you are able to spend $500-600 for a yearly site fee, plus several hundreds to renew it each year, how many books are you going to sell to pay for that?

We don't do much to celebrate Valentine's Day in the Lick The Bowl Household. When Mr. H and I first got together I had high expectations for this holiday, it is the day of love after all. I expected dinner out, a romantic movie at the theater, red flowers, puffy hearts, chocolate and all that other cuddly crap! Before you start rolling your eyes at me I have to mention that we started dating in high school and I didn't know any better. haha! It only took me one year together to realize that the holiday is way overrated.

When given a challenge, many of south Florida’s youth rise to the occasion and students in Broward County Public Schools (BCPS) are no exception. After Wheelabrator Technologies asked three local schools to create a solution to an environmental or public challenge in their community, each school stepped to the plate to research and then conduct a year-long project. Their projects culminate in the Wheelabrator Symposium for Environment and Education to be held on May 1, 2012 at the DoubleTree Hotel in Sunrise. This is an annual event that finds its roots in a relationship with Partners In Education, a non-profit that focuses on getting businesses involved in education. Wheelabrator first partnered with BCPS 20 years ago and it was through this partnership that the symposium was developed.

This is when Mary takes things into her own hands. She gets Mark’s mom to drive away in her van, thus leaving her able to get away unfollowed. All roads lead to just before the Mexico border. Here we find James, who has put one of the jewels in a locker for Finn to find. The rest will come only when Finn transfers the money into his account. Just as the transfer happens, Mary hops into James’ plumbing van. She’s found her dad…again! And cuffs him…again! Mary 2, FBI 0!

Danielle Thorne's Book News & More
For anyone who likes modern day thrillers with a mystical, historical flavour then this is a good read. The plot is fast paced and the use of small punchy chapters rattles you through with quick speed being very episodic between the various characters and interweaving plot lines. A bit Dan Brown in style. And will you find out what "The Sacrament" is, the secret the monks so carefully protect from the outside world - and why do they keep it so secret? One thing I did find - the beginning of the book felt like there had been slightly more time spent on the descriptions of places, events, feelings etc. and this died of as the plot pace increased - a shame I thought it one of the highlights at the start and did set it apart from the likes of Dan Brown and others who are a bit bereft in that department at times.
POLITICAL NECESSITY: In U.S. criminal law, necessity may be either a possible justification or an exculpation for breaking the law. Defendants seeking to rely on this defense argue that they should not be held liable for their actions as a crime because their conduct was necessary to prevent some greater harm and when that conduct is not excused under some other more specific provision of law such as self defense. Most common law and civil law jurisdictions recognize this defense, but only under limited circumstances. Generally, the defendant must affirmatively show (i.e., introduce some evidence) that (a) the harm he sought to avoid outweighs the danger of the prohibited conduct he is charged with; (b) he had no reasonable alternative; (c) he ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed; and (d) he did not himself create the danger he sought to avoid.
Peter Basedow, a board member with Science for Peace at the University of Toronto, attended the shareholders meeting with a single share, but failed to get an apology from Berrick for his allegations that gold mining giant committed human rights violations.
The next morning, I ventured over to the cattle yard. The poor hens had moved back to their coop, but since it was upside down, they were getting very wet in the rain. They were obviously confused at the changes in their home. I could see the black hen underneath. The oldest son wanted to bury her right away so he went in and tried to pull her out. Soon, I heard “Mom–she’s alive!”. Sure enough, that feisty bird lived through the ordeal. She could not move one of her legs and was evacuated into luxury accommodations in the garage with three boys attending to her every need. I can now add “chicken physical therapist” to my growing list of skills. As of July 2 (when I write this blog) that hen is almost fully recovered and is back with her flock-mates.

The question remains, did the decision by Justice Theis put XB, and other vulnerable people, into a position where they will be more easily abused by family members or friends.

The 26-year-old midfielder also confirmed he is still troubled by the ankle problem that required surgery in 2008 and which has affected his performances during the latter part of the campaign. “I’ve been quite unlucky in the second half of the season because not only have I been knocked and knocked and knocked on the same ankle that’s caused me a lot of trouble but just at the moment when I felt the worst physically we had a dip in form as a team,” he said.

Sometimes patients bring me coffee, or recently, gifts for my newborn daughter. This always strikes me as super awesome. I would love to exchange goods directly for my work. I figure with the decline of civilization I’ll start being paid in a much more simple “I’ll-give-you-eggs-if-you-put-my-broken-leg-back-into-place” sort of deal. The only reason I haven’t switched already is Consuela The Nanny insists on being paid cold hard cash. Or coupons to Bath and Bodyworks.

I am counting on all of you crafty women out there to help me out on this. Several years ago, I had silk flowers and plants all throughout my house and thought it looked great.

Now, while looking all around your houses, decorations, etc., I see silk flowers again.

My workplace had an event today for International Women's Day: there were 30 of us in a room in London, and then groups of the same size or smaller in about 12 other locations around Europe. We had a video call going round the locations, and we were asked what our reaction was to having the event at all, and some questions about various issues within the organisation. We discussed them and then had another video call with someone at each office feeding back whatever we'd said.
But it was the same even when I was a girl. Growing up on a farm in rural Scotland, fashion and appearance weren’t things that were important to me. I spent my life in jodhpurs or clothes that wouldn’t show the mud. What was the point of a pretty dress when there was a saddle to buy?
Anticipating a colorful sunset, I had set up my composition accordingly. I was patiently waiting when, just before reaching the horizon, the sun slipped beneath a cloud and for about 90 seconds painted the canyon’s rim with the brightest, warmest light imaginable. When the light popped I quickly jettisoned my colorful sky composition and scanned the rim for a subject painted by the sunlight. When my eyes fell on this tree I quickly evaluated the scene for the best way to emphasize the tree and foreground light.

It's hard not to take it all personally, but when I am able to stand back from it, I find this concept of being marginalised very interesting. I am a white woman from southern England and although I do not like to think I am middle-class, I have some of those credentials – for instance, I work in the media and speak a bit posh, like. I would, therefore, not be expected to experience much prejudice other than the usual bilge from the odd unreconstructed male.

They grow. I should know this. The smallest of the three little people in my house seems to growing at a faster rate that the bigger two. I should have realized this when he was able to take the eggs out of the fridge and throw them one by one onto the floor. I should have known he was getting bigger when he went into the knife drawer and brought me all of the sharp steak knives and the pair of scissors that he found. You would think I would have noticed him growing when he was able to reach the top of the stove in an effort to grab the boiling pot of water. But I missed all of those signs. I knew he was growing but for some reason I kept forgetting.
In What is the Impact of Financial Advisors on Retirement Portfolio Choices and Outcomes?, John Chalmers of the University of Oregon and Jonathan Reuter of Boston College and NBER examined choices and outcomes in the Oregon University System’s Optional Retirement Plan by looking at participants who used an advisor and those who self-directed their choices. Overall, advisor clients earned net returns that were approximately one percentage point lower per year with much higher volatility. On a risk-adjusted basis, therefore, self-directed investors outperformed their counterparts who used advisors by more than 2 percentage points per year— a difference that is obviously both economically and statistically significant.
Only downside was that we had to walk, in a bit of a drizzle, from the plane to the airport. Not a disaster.

Probably my second favorite moment of this collaboration. If you went out on the streets right now and asked Jets fans who they’d want in tonight’s draft, you’d surely get a mixed bag of answers all over the board. Not so in 1995, as Jets fans get a “We want Sapp” chant going. That’s not an easy task. You have to have everyone on the same page and you have to REALLY want a certain player to actually chant for them. But the pick is Kyle Brady from Penn State, a tight end with hands worse than a clock. Devastation. At this point, no one’s laughing, just feeling sorry for themselves. Those are the faces we’ve come to know all too well from Jets fans. Hang in there guys.
I have the same philosophy for toys/games/activities with the little boys - I'm not worried about making a mess but I try to tidy up as we go along and am a big believer in packing up before you get out the next thing!

Regarding split personalities, we must, as Christians, make sure that we employ online personalities that are in harmony with our real-life personalities. We must be consistent people. We must beware the temptation to harness the power of anonymity so that you can just “let loose.” Toward this end, a good measure is to remember that if something is inappropriate in real life, it is also inappropriate online.

Low-voltage wiring is a scam in the construction industry. It’s easy to do, it’s not even dangerous like line-voltage electrical work, and the materials are very inexpensive. Yet it costs more to wire a house with low-voltage wiring than it does to wire a house with electricity. They can do this because people think of it as “high-tech” so it must be more complicated and must cost more. So it does.

You can build a new life for yourself if you are able to write down your feelings and things that you would normally keep to yourself. These things will include the daily reminders that you have to endure and how they make you feel. You may want to include what you are going to do in order to make these reminders seem a little bit easier to cope with. You will be surprised at how writing it down on paper can help the situation a little more.

The specific numbers given (40/60 split) provided a superficial appearance of scientific objectivity to cover what was in fact no more than a highly-prejudiced guess, because such things cannot be measured or quantified, but they achieved the required outcome (which was to strip this person of his benefits and for which the company to which the DWP has delegated its medical assessments would receive a handsome financial reward).

(19) The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath. (20) They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.

Catdog Season 1.5 offers lessons on money management in “The Collector”, and honesty in “Armed and Dangerous.” But that’s not all it teaches. It also teaches the value of friendship in a number of the show’s episoodes, including “Catdog’s End.” After dog drives Cat crazy yet again, Cat sees an ad on television for a place that could swap out anyone’s lower half. Classic movie buffs will love this for the Cary Grant-esque figure who endorses the office. Cat decides he’s going to go and get split from dog, and replaced with a different lower half. But in the process, Cat begins to realize just how valueable Dog’s friendship is, and how bad off he’d be without Dog. In his realization, Cat saves himself and Dog at the last minute, and tells him he doesn’t want to be split up. This is one more valueable lesson to audiences young and old alike.
I’m working on my next book tentatively entitled Rule of Law. It will come out next spring. It’s the story of another flawed protagonist. He is a former college quarterback who got caught up in a point-shaving scandal, served time in prison, and then went to law school and became a lawyer. He finally gets his first job but ends up at a firm where somebody is killing off all the firm’s lawyers, one-by-one (even lawyers who try to leave the firm). It’s a story about loyalty and trust, honor and betrayal.

Encouraged by his local success, Cruse started to work out a new strip, called Barefootz. Barefootz was a man with enormous bare feet who felt constrained by the workaday world. The characters had the big heads and little bodies demanded by a daily strip’s cramped proportions. They found their way, though, in the larger format of underground anthologies. The Barefootz world expanded and the storylines became more personal, particularly when a struggling artist character named Headrack came out. To Cruse, Headrack had always been a stand-in for himself, and he’d always known the character was gay, just as he is.

A couple of months ago, I took a full day class at the local Hospice in order to become a volunteer...I knew when we moved that I would need to do something to get out there...and communicate with adults..I could so easily just stay in the sewing room all day... I mentioned something in passing to my daughter (or did she ask me? can't remember) and I signed up.. Volunteers are always needed to visit with patients. I asked to be assigned to the office to help with paperwork. I file, make copies, put together folders and I am sure as the weeks go on, I will learn more projects to keep me busy..
With that in mind,

Over the next two hours, Björk is perfectly forthcoming, but there's this sense that she's wary, withholding herself somehow. In the past she's talked of being a warrior, and 'fierce' remains one of her favourite words. But 'flinty' seems a better fit for this new Björk. Seemingly made of the same stuff as Iceland's igneous landscape, she's like a pebble: small, but elementally obdurate. "Born stubborn, me," as she sings on Vespertine, an album that is all about sanctuary, withdrawal, and privacy.

The myth that children are tech-savvy future-focused intellectually advanced gadget geniuses is nonsense. It’s placing our prejudices and failings onto them and making excuses or simply not noticing that age inappropriate material is so easily accessed by young children..
Some things are not worthy of 'understanding'. However, 'understanding' is increasingly our official policy on most normal crimes and murders, so perhaps this is simply a natural progression of liberal thought. Perhaps one day we will talk about Hitler's strict upbringing or Stalin's poverty and wring our hands that the poor lambs were driven to such acts, and never mind denying rational, personal choice, one of the fundamental aspects of being human.
The Strand is a used bookstore in New York City that has been there since 1927 and has EIGHT MILES of new and used books. Basically, the place sounds like heaven on earth for a bibliophile like me, and I have now added it to my list of "must-see places"!
These are three ZIS-3 guns. Again the guns and crews are Bolt Action. I hope one can tell from these pictures (all pictures are thumbnailed to larger versions btw.), but the one on the left has a winter whitewash. I actually have a fourth gun, but that will be pressed in German service.
I don’t know if it was silly of me because I could have lost my job, but I am not confortable when I lie like that. Yehhh I can be that silly.

But what does that mean, you ask? Well, for those raving Teatro ZinZanni fans who cannot afford tickets as often as they would like, now is your chance to nab night of show general admission tickets for the insanely low price of $59 per person(plus tax of $2.75)!!! Same great show, same delicious feast, but at a lower price. Rush tickets will get you in the door, but do not include any additional menu enhancements, delicious wine, ingenious specialty cocktails, the $10 per person dinning room service charge, or fabulous boutique items.

As if the 100 or so Belgian speciality brews on the menu was not enough for a Belgophile, the walls are covered by Tin-Tin cartoons and Belgian-style beer enamel commercials. There are small wooden tables with abbey-inspired sofa backs. The atmosphere is quite relaxed, at least in the early afternoon.
There’s a great free e-book[3] from Network for Good and Sea Change Strategies called Homer Simpson for Non-profits: The Truth About How People Really Think & What It Means for Promoting Your Cause by Katya Andresen, Alia McKee, and Mark Rovner. In it, the authors assert a bit of common sense that many folks may not know they know:
“In the human brain there is a tiny gland called the pineal body, which is the sacred eye of the ancients, and corresponds to the third eye of the Cyclops. Little is known concerning the function of the pineal body, which Descartes suggested (more wisely than he knew) might be the abode of the spirit of man.”

The railroad runs from Mombassa to Kisumu, which is on the eastern banks of Lake Victoria. This line, or a branch of it, was under construction. The exact place was about 350 miles west of Mombassa, in the province of Nyanza in what is today Kenya. Shankar was the clerk and storekeeper in the construction camp there. He had a small tent of his own. There were many other tents. Indeed, everyone who worked there lived on tents as there was no village or township around. The tents were set in concentric circles in an open field — and the field was open, miles of open grassland, interspersed with trees. Actually, there was a large baobab tree near the tents. Africa’s famous baobab tree, something Shankar had seen many times in books, and now there was one just around the corner.
DiCarlo’s pizza is famous in the Ohio Valley. My bff Ramaine got me to try it the first time as my parents were anti-pizza, I think. They rarely brought home pizza. When I was young, I was quite picky. I would never try pizza because it had stuff mixed together and round pieces of mystery meat dropped all over the top. It took me a while of listening to my friends Ooooh and Ahhhhh over its goodness before I tried a piece. Ramaine’s dad brought home a few boxes and I was going to get the chance to experience DiCarlo’s pizza for the very first time. I think I may have been ten or eleven. Oooh…….Ahhhhhhh. A slice of heaven, I tell ya.
It is hard enough to perform for regular English people, let alone English Jews. The English think they are the funniest people in the world. They sit there thinking they are funnier than you are, or that ten of their mates are funnier than you. That is probably true. Every nation thinks their sense of humour is the best because people who know you are always going to make you laugh more than strangers. Your family knows which buttons to push to make you laugh. In this way comedy is the opposite of sex. Sex often isn’t very good with your family.
Another indication of the identity of Cain with the Babylonian Sargon is that the name variously rendered Sargon, Sargoni, Sarrukinu, Shargani, etc., may reasonably be taken as synonymous with "King Cain," the first syllable Sar or Shar meaning ruler or King in Babylonia and obviously the origin of Shah, Czar, Sahib, Sire, Sir, etc., while the second syllable gon, gani, gina or kinu, is very like Cain.
Much of Nourishment subverts what we might expect from a wartime story. Some consists of what we might call expected surprises, the nuts and bolts of fiction, such as the children’s disappointment when they return home from their evacuation (“‘Is that man our father?’ said Albertina”). Elsewhere, the approaches are more subtle: the correspondence drawn between food and sex are clever and unexpected, providing a story of appetites poorly catered for in wartime, and how they shrink back or swell up to change their owners. There is an unsettling but satisfying comic treatment of developments of the day.

In other Kardashian news, as things spice up between Kim and Kanye West, Kim’s soon to be ex-husband has been calling her out on the little white lies she’s been known to tell. A little while ago, you may remember that Kim donated double the amount of the monetary value that she and ex Kris Humphries received in wedding gifts to charity ($200,000). Super sweet, right? Well KHump and his lawyers have come out and said that Kim seems to have “forgotten” the $325,000 white Ferrari they were given by a Malaysian businessman as a wedding gift. Apparently, Kris thinks double the amount would be more like $700,000. But this is speculation, so I’m definitely not saying it’s fact, but either way, giving $200,000 to charity was nice.

There is one psychic I know of who has an incredible reputation, is fully booked for months in advance and yet she guesses at most of what she says, generalises a lot in a clever way, repeats the same things to every 4 out of 10 people and basically is not very good at all. What she is so good at is letting them talk non stop though and has a good 5 minute conversation at the start of the reading and with them doing all the talking as they’re nervous. She gets enough information from that initial start that she can turn it all around to sound different making it look like she got it herself by reading them.

Maya Angelou's autobiographical offering "The Heart of a Woman" - not to be confused by the exhibition of Harlequin covers of the same name - is not the most appropriate selection for a book club - for the simple reason that it is book four of a five-book autobiography, and none of the other books are on the list. So it is actually very difficult to assess Angelou's book entirely out of context, but, this review shall attempt to do so, as its goal is to assess books within the context of Oprah's Book Club's list.

A State Department spokesperson explains lamely that the reward is meant for incriminating evidence against Mr. M that would stand up in court. The prime minister of M’s home state condemns foreign interference in his country’s internal affairs. In the midst of this imbroglio, the United States decides to release $1.18 billion in aid to the cash-strapped government of the defiant prime minister to persuade him to reopen supply lines for US and NATO forces bogged down in the hapless neighboring Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

Now for those of you thinking “awww, poor girl. He slept with her and then blows her off the next day…” Just stop. Stop for a second, and listen to the texts. If you JUST saw someone the night before, it is really not necessary to see them the next day. I don’t think it was unreasonable of Kevin to not want to hang with her. Lots of people don’t want to get that involved so early on in a relationship. Kevin was probably just trying to keep his distance. I think it’s good to remain a little distant when you first begin to date someone: whether you are looking to get in a relationship with them or not. If you are planning on dating someone, then I definitely wouldn’t sleep with them too early on. If you never wanna see someone again, then by all means fuck them whenever.
The Midwest seems to be an active area for weather modification, spraying, and/or chemtrails. I did not find these pictures download these pictures or alter these photographs. I did however take these pictures. All in my area and in St Louis. Some took with a cheap camera. Others with my blackberry, and a few with my new phone. In the past I have contacted air traffic control in my area to address the issue and to see about getting some questions answered. The first person I talked to was very helpful and gave me a phone number. It was a direst line to air traffic control. When I called they seemed happy to take my call. Once I identified myself they sounded very eager to answer the questions that I had. I called several times using this number when needing to communicate with them. Once to address the 8th photograph. Several military transport vehicles in my area. There are no bases within 30 miles of my city. They said that there was a training mission going on in the area. Scott Airforce base happened to be who was performing the exercise. In another instance I had called to ask about heavy traffic over the St Charles area. It was an airshow. There was a lot of traffic flying to and from. Plus the airshow itself.

The Patent Office should focus its examination resources on important patents and pay little attention to the rest. But it is difficult for the government to know ahead of time which patents are likely to be important. There are two groups, however, that have better information about the likely technological and commercial value of inventions: patent applicants and competitors. To harness information in the hands of patent applicants, we could give applicants the option of earning a presumption of validity by paying for a thorough examination of their inventions. Put differently, applicants should be allowed to “gold plate” their patents by paying for the kind of searching review that would merit a presumption of validity. (Lemley et al., 2005) An applicant who chooses not to pay could still get a patent. That patent, however, would be subject to serious—maybe even de novo—review in the event of litigation. Most likely, applicants would pay for serious review with respect to their most important patents but conserve resources on their more speculative entries.6 That would allow the Patent Office to focus its resources, thus benefiting from the signal given by the applicant’s own self-interested choice.

I never totally got it when pre-kids, people would say: they come out with a personality all of their own. Ok, I get it now. It is so amazing and fun and exhausting and wild to watch the personalities of our little boys unfold. They certainly live up to the title of this post because man are we in the midst of a personality explosion - all their own! These are unfolding more and more, but the interesting thing is that although they have of course evolved in magnitude from their early teeny tiny days, the core of them has remained the same since birth.

In the above I do NOT include the great digital artists out there that incorporate photographic imagery in their work and blend perfect visualisation of a powerful image with immaculate technique. But these are few and far between. Ironically one thing these digital artists often have in common is that the strength of their work lies in making a visual construct that looks incredible, precisely because it appears so real. They pay attention to every detail, the way light falls, shadows... all to fool you brain into thinking the impossible construct really did exist.

Late-Summer 1968 – There has been quite a noise over the last few weeks in the Melody Maker; their writers have been talking about this new group from America. A few pictures have been posted – the group all seem to wear hats and beards and, according to the scribes to whom I subscribe, the music they make is unutterably glorious: a heady mix of Southern soul and Northern driftwood.
Behind that deal, South Africa’s public protector Lawrence Mushwana found in 2009, was Eskom chairperson Valli Moosa, who “acted improperly’ because he awarded the price-busting contract in blatant conflict of interest, for simultaneously he served on the ANC’s finance committee.
This rifle is really becoming my 'go-to' shooter for range visits. When it had the E.A. lower, I liked it. However, the feel of the grip frame and trigger in the Cav is really appealing to me- and it has proven to be a completely reliable package so far. The only maintainence I run on this gun is:
