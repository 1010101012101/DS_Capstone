Trolls come in second in the “baddest” category, as they had two raids directly related to them: Zul’Gurub and Zul’Aman. Unlike the undead, it’s clear that these trolls were in full control of their mental facilities, so this clearly is a “racial” issue. Yes, they were under bad leadership (and still are, apparently), but they chose to worship Hakkar and their totem spirits, so they really only have themselves to blame. The troll count for raid bosses totals 13, even if a lot of them have since been downgraded to dungeon bosses.

Authors have been writing stories inspired by video games since I first began reading science fiction in the 1970's, and for far longer than that they've been writing fiction to illustrate the dehumanizing effects of war. Yet in "'Run,' Bakri Says," Ferrett Steinmetz manages to do both in an original and powerful way.

After a few weeks of planning and two straight days of constructing, it was almost three o’clock in the morning and our work day was still continuing on. The basement was cold, our hands were sore, and our eyes were heavy, but we kept on going. Just before we were done, the phone rang and, at first, our many hours spent brainstorming was deemed worthless. It turns out that the event we were building a display for was very different from what we had in mind. Our concept was too big and elaborate for the intimate setting that would be housing our bespoke sneakers, so we had to quickly re-evaluate our plan. Initially, we were lost, not knowing how to incorporate what he had with what we needed.

I first met Susan around 9 years ago , she was a black woman who viewed the world so different, she was ridiculed locally and deemed mad.I hung around with her for around 2 years meeting up about 2-3 times a week,we became good friends and dated briefly. After knowing her for about 4 hours I was drawn into her mystical world and although experience had taught me to be cautious, I freely entered into her strange world. her ground floor flat was grubby and crammed with junk and other stuff.

April 22, 1970 was the first Earth Day. The Green Party of the United States was formed in 1984 guided by such values as future focus and sustainability and ecological wisdom. June 1992 was the first Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where world leaders gathered for a unified cause, the healing of the earth.
A week and a half ago the big day was there, we left the house early, for a girlie day filled with roller coasters. To make a whole day of it, we would stop half way for a cup of coffee as you do when you take a day trip. But somewhere in between getting out of the car and into the highway cafe (which was according to us more likely the waiting room for death) my iphone slipped out of my hand, and met the pavement. Luckily only the glass cracked and it still worked, this was not gonna stand in my way.

Therefore, when Roman Catholics pray “Hail Mary, full of grace, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus;” these Christians are — perhaps unwittingly — stating that the grace, with which Mary is filled, is indeed the Son of God. This grace is not hers; she is not full of her own grace. Rather Mary is full of God’s grace for she is full of God Himself.
The nights in Bali are incredibly alive, depending on where you are. In Seminyak, we had what was the best night of partying ever that ended in everyone diving into the infinity pool stretched along the curve of the beach, as the Grammy nominated Dj Mark Ronson spun the last song of the night. Something was very right about this party. Everyone was truly celebrating the moment in their driven spirits inspired by music, wine and most importantly incredible company. At the Potato head Beach club in Bali, almost every weekend something exciting is happening. Kuta is famous for its nightclubs but they are more the shady drunken brawl sort of clubs with flashing lights and a pole dancer who checks her watch every five minutes, to get off her pole so she can go home. It wasn’t a pleasant experience with pissed drunk men who broke into a brawl.

Dudley was a VERY good dog. When we brought our son home from the hospital after he was born, and we just sort of looked at each other with the ‘Holy crap, now what the hell do we do’ look that I am certain all first time parents share upon realizing that they have, indeed, created a small human being who will be totally reliant upon them for pretty much ever, and they didn’t even have to take a test to show that they were at least capable of raising this mini-human. At least that is the look that the Missus and I shared. Jeeze. To this day I am astounded that we are parents, and our son is now closer to 8 than 7. Pretty sure we broke some universal laws by procreating, but I reckon that’s another story. Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, Dudley. When we brought our son home, we just set him on the bed while we tried to figure out our next move. In about 3.2 seconds, Dudley had jumped up and even before we could panic about the dog next to the newborn, he just lied next to him and smiled his doggie smile. You could tell he was cool with having a brother. Who cared that the new brother was sorta bald and didn’t have a tail? This was his brother, dammit, and that was that.
“I gazed around the room slowly. The best swimmers from Russia, Cuba, the United States, Spain, Germany and France were in front of me. And I was different. I was the fag.

As time went on - and once I actually became a parent as opposed to just talking about it - things changed quite a bit. Parenting is not about a consistent, upward trajectory in terms of anything - their development, your development, or anything else. It is not about obeying or controlling. But it is about trusting, loving, comforting, supporting, communicating, and being available always and in all ways, unconditionally and without expectations of reciprocity. But oh, how hard that can be - especially if we lack perspective.
Tapping that fat vein of experimental distilling, Bell subtitled the self-published tome Alternative Whiskey Recipes and Distilling Techniques for the Adventurous Craft Distiller. Alt Whiskeys is a turning point in the literature of American distilling. There’s nothing else out there that captures, page after page, our modern distillers’ spirit of innovation with new ingredients, techniques, and equipment — or that reveals the deep connections between craft brewing and craft distilling, as evidenced by Bell’s thorough use of original and target gravities, fermentation temperatures, barrel notes, and other specific technical notes that read more like something from brewers' manuals than the recipes one usually finds for spirits.

In July 1989, Petitioner filed a second application for post-conviction relief in the state district court in Tulsa, Oklahoma, alleging for the first time that he had been punished in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment when he was convicted and sentenced for both the charge of felony murder and the underlying felony of armed robbery. The state district court denied that application on the ground that Petitioner failed to raise the double jeopardy claim in the trial court, on direct appeal, or in his first application for post-conviction relief; therefore, the court held, under Oklahoma law, the claim was waived. In an unpublished order, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial, holding that all issues previously ruled upon by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals were res judicata, and that Petitioner had waived all issues raised for the first time in his second petition for post-conviction relief. See Okla.Stat.Ann. tit. 22, Sec. 1086 (West 1986).
The characters are all so well developed and played. Downey Jr. is charismatic as Tony Stark/Iron Man and he provides a good portion of the comic relief. I was hesitant at first over the casting of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk (after Edward Norton had to turn down the role) but I believe he held his own. Perhaps a little depressing at times, but then again, that's kind of how the character has to be. Chris Evans as Captain America was far more appealing in The Avengers then he was in his own film, and way more likable. Chris Hemsworth is probably the only person I could ever picture playing Thor. Sam Jackson was great, but didn't seem to have a large enough role in the grand scheme of things. Obviously his Nick Fury characters is the hub of the Avengers but I assumed he'd be a bigger part of the fighting...but then again, I don't know much about the series. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow was OK but we don't have enough of a back story for her (she was featured in Iron Man 2) to really feel either way about her (at least I didn't). This is also true for Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye. He had no back story. He didn't get his own movie beforehand. So I don't know where he came from. Renner is great performance wise, but I didn't see the importance in the character. While I thought the first half dragged focusing primarily on the heroes we already knew well...they should have spent more time developing Hawkeye and Black Widow.

Firstly, for quite a population in our country, female children are considered a liability. A vexatious object, a beautiful creation, which is to be loathed. The funny part being, not only is the hatred parted by masculine side of the family; but the feminine half exchanges the un-pleasantries never the less. Believe me, please do; I write this not on witnessing some melodramatic idiot-box crap; but my own discretion of events witnessed first-hand. I was 13 years old then, but had a fair sense of rage on the plight of my then female colleagues. The delivery ward, the families, some overjoyed, some worried. Worried about the third girl child delivered, the anguish of broken expectations of having a male child starkly written on their faces, the fear of the third marriage that they will have to conduct; the misery I expected that mother to go through in the days to come…

Less than two years ago my husband Steve suffered a major heart attack with six blockages. We’d recently moved to Florida and only begun to make friends. The day before his heart attack I’d been invited to a lunch gathering by a gal in our new church. Carol’s was the only number in my new cell phone as I drove north to a strange city where Steve was being airlifted to a heart center. Tears choked my words as I asked her to pray. Not only did Carol alert a lifeline of prayer warriors, but she and another friend showed up to sit with me the entire day at the hospital as I waited for our children to arrive.

I am sure all this kitsch attachment to the antlers, and while on the topic I can hardly bring myself to mention the man sized pop up inflatable reindeer that is ready and waiting to burst upon our unsuspecting neighbours, is because secretly Husband and I are both mourning the Christmases of our youth. Because if you are by birth a Northern Hemisphere person then Christmas is indivisibly associated with dark evenings with houses lit up like advent calendars, cold, snow, rain, Christmas lights, and fir trees . I really love our Southern Hemisphere Christmas with morning swims on the beach, heat and sun, palm trees and a glorious mix of a lunch with oysters, sushi, roast potatoes, turkey, salads, Christmas pudding and ice cream cake, but somehow it just doesn’t feel the same. Though as Sydney is having its coldest December for 50 years, and the rain is lashing down with particular ferocity as I type, I have to admit I am beginning to feel we might be in for more of a traditional UK Christmas than I would actually like – so just keep those antlers crossed that the sun shines for a traditional Aussie day.

The current levels of public concern about various environmental problems are essentially unchanged from 2010. However, Americans are less worried today than they were 10 years ago about all eight issues Gallup measured in 2001. The decline over the past decade spans a period when the public often expressed surging concern about terrorism, the Iraq war, gas prices, and the economy.

Venus shares Leo with a mild benefic, Mercury. This means that the persons ability to organize and intellectualize and communicate is a mild factor promoting material happiness and success. She also shares her sign with Ketu – a wildcard. Since Ketu is with two benefics, it amplifies the benefic power. So you should interpret that the person’s mystical insight (ketu) into emotional topics (4th House) is big factor in promoting his material happiness and success.

This week, all week, Existential Ennui will be celebrating the humble paperback book. Because at a time when e-books look increasingly likely to eventually supplant the paperback, this most humble yet still special, versatile and fantastically successful format can surely do with some celebrating. While hardbacks, with their fancy wraparound dustjackets (and doesn't that 'jacket' just imply aloofness, a cut above, upper class?) and solid, dependable case binding are seen as the respectable face of book collecting and publishing, the poor little paperback, forever getting folded and creased and spine-cracked, stuffed in pockets and handbags and left on trains and in loos, is damned as disposable, discardable, destroyable. In second hand bookshops, hardbacks get to nestle snugly inside in the warm on specially constructed bookcases; meanwhile, outside, the paperbacks sit and shiver in dump bins, browning and warping in the elements. If jacketed hardbacks are the aristocracy of the book world, paperbacks are the lumpen proletariat.

From the conversations on the ground, I don’t expect any one new tactic will emerge right away but, over the coming days, expect to see a flurry of new activity as the 99% movement looks for its next incarnation.

When they had made love, William lay back on his pillow. He was thinking of Jane's answer. It was a new conception to him that she could love him enough to give up many things that were meaningful to her. Such a feeling almost amounted to self-sacrifice, an alien phenomenon in William's thinking. And yet, the more he considered it, the more he saw that self-sacrifice had been there all the time in his father and in Jane. He wondered about his responsibility in the face of this new view of human possibilities. He wondered, too, if there was something missing in him that he didn't have this quality possessed by the two best people he had known.
Hellbound: Hellraiser II is the first sequel to Clive Barker’s Hellraiser (1987), it was made immediately after the first one became a huge hit in theaters. Personally, I think that the reason why these films were so successful is Clive Barker’s personal involvement in them, and the universe that he created. The idea that if you dug deep enough, and read the right books, you could end up with something like the Lament Configuration in your hands. That idea that if you wanted it bad enough, maybe, just maybe, you could find the gates to hell itself. Intriguing stuff in deed! Me personally? I enjoy these first few Hellraiser movies because they are fantasy/horror films for adults, they are dark, gory, yet retain that feeling of fantasy to them, that feeling of the impossible, the unreal, the fantastic. The only problem for me with these movies is that its ideas are sometimes bigger than their budgets.

Right at the end of the year Noel pulls out his greatest prediction yet. "If you get tipped for the stardom bit and you're called face of '77 or something, it can be a bit of a lumber, but I'm prepared to lumber this guy because he's come over from Australia, he's had a good '76 but '77 is going to be marvellous for John Christie." Now, I've been trying to work this out as he's not got a Wiki entry and as far as I can tell his most notable release is a 1974 album after he was discovered by Dave Clark (of the Five). He went on to sing and write for Clark's Time musical, and that's about the size of what Google throws up. As you can probably gather, this turned out to be his only UK chart hit, peaking at 24. All this folderol, however, is far from the story, as watching it might explain why he went no further, and give one in the eye to those who thought Elton's appearance a couple of shows back would see the end of chancers at the piano. Already comfortably in a Lidl Gilbert O'Sullivan groove, things start going wrong at the end of the first chorus when, in his white jacket over T-shirt and having already performed through a fixed grin, he sings the last line straight down the camera to his side before jerking his head back and pulling so self-satisfied a smirk, again directly at camera, that it becomes clear that he's not so much channelling Elton as Richard Stilgoe. Much more wobbling his head and entire upper body like his seat is covered in barbed wire and smirking at camera follows before from nowhere a chorus of Auld Lang Syne strikes up at the end of the bridge, which Christie starts miming along to and then gives up on. And just when he starts elongating his notes and you think it's finishing, a drum fill is followed by another round of Auld Lang Syne, an even creepier closed-mouth expression and... the entire audience wandering in in one line behind Christie in the crossed arm Hogmanay celebration singalong style, despite it being eight days ahead of proper time. Not many of them know how to do it or what they're doing. At this stage, especially when he breaks into falsetto over a ludicrously extended coda passage that merely suggests he couldn't think of how to climax the song without all the crashing cymbals, violins, falsetto notes and production weight he could find, you fear it may never end. Even then it fades out. God. Imagine being in the audience that week having to play along to this man's whims.

Our new members are a diverse group of talented, interesting individuals who have brought a wealth of experience, energy, and enthusiasm to our congregation. We are blessed. We are also not fearful. And our kitchen is run by very sane, not terrorist women.
We went out and got her a glove and bat and batting T to practice. (Of course the bat, ball and glove are in pink!) We played a few times but Bekah can be a bit of a perfectionist and if it doesn't come easily the first time or two she wants to give up.

Most of my posts were prepared and scheduled ahead of time. This is especially true of the earlier posts. That seemed to make the entire challenge much easier to complete. I would recommend that others at least plan the subject of the post in advance.
Yesterday was a full long day of meetings at work. LOOONG day. It was followed by a dinner where we were all assigned seats randomly so as to foster everyone in the company getting to know each other. I noticed, with a giggle, that there were very few women as compared to the number of men (the line of work I'm in is overwhelmingly staffed by men) , so women were rationed out at one per table. That really didn't suck, at least from the girl perspective.

Hi there! So happy to be here for our monthly "By Invitation only" post where a very special group of bloggers get together to present our interpretation on a mutually agreed upon theme for a particular month. This month its all about spring, a new season, new beginnings and a reawakening. What does spring mean to us? Well to me, its a time of rebirth, a time of renewal, a time to open the windows both literally and figuratively. The warm air is knocking on our door, the blooms are bursting and everything feels new again..........
Every year the Year 3s in my daughter's school have an Egyptian Day when they have to go to school dressed as an Egyptian. In anticaption of this I purchased an Egyptian outfit from Amazon, we decided we'd plait her hair the night before so it was wrinkly like Cleopatra and I bought blue eyeshadow and black eyeliner to paint her eyes. All sorted!
Hey y'all. I've been working on our home office again, namely my craft-splosion, and what I've discovered about myself is that I love paper. And I mean love paper. It's everywhere. Ev-er-y-where. Scrapbook paper, craft ideas, sewing patterns and on and on. It's a bit out of control. I've gotten a new tool to take care of the more "home office" type of paper (ie: bills, manuals, etc), but I when considering the paper I have for craft projects, scrapbook layouts, and sewing - I really can't go paperless. I mean, I can't sew without pattern pieces. When considering that I have quite a few hobbies, I knew I needed a cute, organized way to store all of it that would be handy when I needed something, but streamlined and easily stored when I didn't.
I have never been in a place, mentally or physically, to participate in anything like this. However, a solid year of “me time” has resulted in a person I barely recognize. I am stronger, faster, more confident, and feel more like myself, than at any point since graduating from college 10 years ago and becoming an “adult.” I wanted to do this!

I have no doubt made the book sound so grim, so perverse and offputting that reading it four times seems only a little less mad than writing it. However Heller, a messy but riotous storyteller in Catch-22, shows control of narrative and voice which makes terrible things into compulsive reading, rather as Thomas Bernhard’s unbroken paragraphs seem initially unwelcoming but propel the reader on. The tension comes from wondering what, among the few events that actually take place in the book (conversations, mostly), will eventually happen. Something does. And if the something is worth waiting for, that’s not to say that the long journey there is a slog. It’s a bizarre delight. Sentence by sentence, Heller peppers the reader with irony, bravery and foolishness, sometimes simultaneously. The telling is technically immaculate: pages of dialogue with multiple counterparties flow faster and faster under the reader’s thumbs. It is structurally brilliant, with Slocum’s story flowing unnoticeably from past to present and from one worry to another – so the reader has no docking points to get off at even if they wanted to. It is a cautionary tale, which offers a compellingly nasty angle on a portion of society and the questions people rarely ask of themselves (“I often wonder what my true nature is. Do I have one?”). It oozes hot grief from the cracks in its tough, cool shell. It chucks a bucket of water over the reader when Slocum is at his most self-pitying: ”It is too late to gather me all up and put me together again.” And when he says, “There are things going on inside me I cannot control and do not admire,” is he a proto-Patrick Bateman, or just like you and me?

Being out of the house means that I have to be dressed in appropriate out-of-the-house clothing. Which means my brain is more likely not to think that it’s okay to fall asleep or stop working in some other, disastrous way. Being in a coffee shop means that I get a big, warm mug to hold in my hands, which I really find soothing and comforting, while working out any more complicated ideas I may need to put the book or pen down for.

Physically, it is so easy to go to the Lord in prayer. But we have an adversary who makes it, oh, so difficult. The flesh is still willing, but the spirit is weak. Are you utilizing God’s grace, striving together so that the preaching of the cross bears it’s intended fruit?

One of the most conspicuous soldiers on the battlefield is the color bearer. Those who carried the regimental flag into the fight could not carry a weapon, as both hands were required to raise the flag and keep it aloft for the rest of the unit to follow. As a result, the enemies fired at the color bearer more than any other soldier, because if the flag fell, those following it could not continue their charge. On the opposite side, those attacking could not allow the flag to fall. Therefore, as one color bearer was shot down, another, and another would grasp the standard and carry it onward.
There may be better ones out there, but I can only go by the 300 books that I own and have read. there’s over 2000 books about Elvis, so I have only made a small dent.
Proper pre-produced list paper is quite the rage, and this one is split into four columns: things to do; telephone; letter/email/web; out and about. The list-writer here, however, has ignored all those conventions and written their list of boozy cake-baking ingredients on the other side, along with a note to whoever has been sent to the shops in their absence. The note reads: “Please transfer washing to dry as you may need knickers. xxxx.” You can make up your own sign-off for that.

After enjoying the benefits of our tracking we decided to head back to the East and visit Makipi's Male who had been found while we were out tracking. Along the way there we were in for a treat as we found Waterbuck, Impala, Giraffe and Zebra all in very close proximity to one another. Stopping to enjoy them may have cost us our sighting of the Leopard though as shortly before getting to the sighting he was lost in a very thickly vegetated drainage line. Lucky for us our guests were not perturbed as they had seen three different Leopard in the four nights that they had stayed with us, plus a multitude of other amasing things, which included the “ Big Seven.” It would have been nice to wrap up there final drive though but instead we decided to take a late coffee break with the Hippo's in Argyle Dam,
Me: "But if it was a question, how would you answer it?"
To me, Nature is the key to the spiritual. I feel a deeper connection to my soul just by spending time outside each day, and I remember what it’s like to be present. I regain the lighthearted joy of childhood and I feel unconditional acceptance as each green leaf tells me that I’m an integral part of creation.
But here's the rub - even if Gygax Games republishes LA, at least as the system stands, I reckon it's doomed to fail yet again. As a game it's not drastically different from other RPGs, but LA has a giant millstone around its neck and it's not the system itself, rather the terminology used in the game. Most RPGs use terms and labels that we are all familiar with, i.e. class, level, spell, character, etc. It is this familiarity that makes it easy to pick up a new game and start playing it relatively quickly, even if the game is fairly complicated. But to play LA you need to learn a whole new language. Here are some examples:

Womens sweaters, sweater wraps with sequins and beads now are a pretty common sight with women of all ages. Depending on how they are worn, you can look pretty stylish and elegant in them. Youngsters prefer to wear them with something short and make a style statement with them by wearing them at social events, rock concerts and other such mass appeal events.

In terms of sound quality ... it's not bad but it's not great. Basically the master tapes are supposedly lost (although Morricone has said that if anyone can find them they are welcome to release the score). My understanding is that the score (as presented here) is mostly lifted from the movie itself. This does mean that there are some sound effects etc. mixed in with the music. Despite that the sound quality is pretty decent and the sound effects are minimal. Oh and there are a couple of tracks (at the end) that came from the only official release (a 45 release that came out when the movie did).

I got a wash cloth and smacked it on her head and told Levi what happened. You know, since I was on the phone anyways and not watching my 2 year old. He asked if she needed stitches. I said that would require looking at the gash and well, that wasn't going to happen. I can't do blood and certainly not when my hormones and emotions are 5 different places on the map at any given moment.

How do you deal with extra costs like buying gifts or unexpected costs? My bestie and I were discussing shower gifts and she feels obligated to buy three gifts for the three showers for her future sister in law (not to mention a wedding gift) – I think that’s insane. I believe in one shower gift, one wedding gift. I don’t think it’s rude not to bring a gift to each shower, what do you guys think? Am I the only one who hates the feeling of obligation to buy shower gifts?

Inspired by recent reportage at the Horse Fly, Jim and I decided to list some notable political songs. Turns out there are way too many of them, though not enough on a local level (how could there be?), so we’re going with a double LPs-worth of more or less idiosyncratic protest songs. Everybody sing along.
I didn’t always agree with the decisions she made, but I genuinely like this woman.

“The girls” have often garnered far more attention over the years than I was comfortable with. Dark tops in brown, black and navy are helpful and I seldom wear anything showing any cleavage at all, just to downplay that element because everyone except little children seem to notice “the girls” first, then look into my eyes.

At the gathering of military chiefs on April 25 and 26, subjects addressed were NATO’s wars and occupations in three continents: In addition to the ten-and-a-half-year conflict in Afghanistan, NATO’s top brass discussed missions in Kosovo (Kosovo Force), off the Horn of Africa (Operation Ocean Shield), in Libya (Operation Unified Protector), the Mediterranean Sea (Operation Active Endeavor) and no doubt others. Most everywhere, indeed, but on or near the Atlantic Ocean, north or south.

I will sign off now and hope my state of contentment sticks with you.

So now that you all know I went to town, I couldn't go looking like a frump, which is why I decided on the bright lips! I had initially done a smokey eye, but for some reason it just wasn't working for me! I know its a little smoky, but it isn't exaclty what I was looking for. I ended up covering it with a yellow pigment called "Pineapple" from GOSH cosmetics. I think the base layer was MAC in Knighted. I wasn't thrilled with the way my eyeshadow turned out, but I was WAY too lazy to take it all of and start new! Regardless, I think I looked okay and nobody stared at me funny, so I guess that's a bonus! The only thing I had to constantly watch was lipstick on my teeth! For some reason, yesterday was a terrible day for that! But whatever I suppose, it's happened to all of us, so I'm not going to let it get me down! I will for sure be wearing something similar to this again!
Hello friends. I have been sick for several days and not had the energy to post or do much crafting. Found out tonight that it was probably the flu. The fact that I got my flu shot last fall probably helped keep the fever and body aches that normally accompany the flu at bay. God is good!
Beuys was the master of the Kunstacademie Düsseldorf, the most famous living German artist, and, not the least, a diva. I can imagine Beuys, from his figurative height atop the apex of German art, bestowing the nom de guerre “Blinky Palermo” onto Heisterkamp, along with it the secrets of the artist as, in Beuys' words, both “shaman and showman.” It was as if Beuys was trying to bring his student Heisterkamp into a type of artmaking where your name and art practice become ever more massive, appropriating the myths and history of the German past, concocting new myths, and asking for everything. What was expected was nothing less than a complete transformation, starting with the personal and concluding in political revolution.
And what will happen to the empowered, downtrodden individual? As the years pass in the dank of the basement, my only hope is that the will of my generation will be strong enough to bring us back into the light and that, once we get there, we can learn to accept that no matter what we’ve been told we can’t change everything.
What has been your experience? Any thoughts out there about fund raising or a better way to include some benefit to the artists who generously give their work to various causes?
Yeah, uhuh. And not anywhere interesting, like to Dubai or England or something, but somewhere else here in the Oslo area. I haven't made a big secret of the fact that I am ready to get out of here. Between the prices and the long winters,(and the petty crime!) it's just not my place. I came here for three years, and that is up this summer. Time to move on, I figure. Nothing against Norway, but I am by birthright a warm weather gal AND a bargain shopper, so you can see how I may not fit in well in a place that is the opposite of my basic make-up, it being a liberal society notwithstanding.
Take these, and your experience with law of attraction and see the universal teachings in your favourite inspirational or sacred texts.

Next, I went to a larger grocery store and purchased the items on my second list. At this store you bag your own groceries and they were also buzzing. Is there a cataclysmic event this weekend or something, with so many people on the roads. By the time I began to put my items on the conveyor belt there was a long line forming behind me. At this store I picked up two boxes of colored spiral pasta, a huge plastic tub of strawberries, and assorted other items. Hurrying, I grabbed both boxes of pasta. The lids were apparently open. and as I moved my arm sideways I slung a confetti hail storm of orange and green pasta all over the people behind me. One man had one in his hair. Whoops. Trying to keep the line moving while at the same time alerting the clerk, I picked up the strawberries. No lie here, the lid opened and they catapulted onto the floor in a big pile in the middle of the pasta. When the clerk arrived with her one paper towel, the guy behind me said “you’re going to need more than that Little Lady, this young woman has leveled the store” (he was 85 hence the young woman) meanwhile removing a second orange pasta piece from his shirt collar. Sorry, I’m so sorry.
Food - Black country pudding
But you know what fixes bitter moods? Food. Better yet, a steak-house dinner with all the fixings. And one that doesn't plague you with guilt, either. So after I scrubbed away the cigarette stench that lingered in every pore, my mom and I wrangled up some of my uncle's organically raised steak and got to work.
From said article: “Fantasy fans often note that the divide between popular and literary fiction was established relatively recently by the modernists, who favored hyperrealism over plot and narrative. Throughout history, pillars of the literary canon, from Homer, Dante, Milton and Shakespeare up through Jules Verne, Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker, blended natural and supernatural elements. The pendulum may now be swinging back, with literature that can be both popular and literary, realistic and fantastical.”

In the book, Katie walks you through the journey of her life, from her "riches" in America her old home, to the "riches" in Uganda, her new home. It really put a lot of things into perspective, and reminded me of just how comfortable we are here in America. I have ran into a lot of people in the past, that say things like, we have to take care of our own people. Why worry about people in Africa too, they are not our responsibility. etc.. But, if you take God's word literally, you will find that, that way of thinking is actually very off.

But, I don't want you to think that I have not spent some of this time chomping on my nails! This unschooling journey is about nothing if not trust and faith. Having been around the block a few times, now, I already knew the possible outcomes that are offered in the school setting: the boredom, the ridicule, the irrelevance, the condescension, the busy work, and, yes, the very real possibility that a kid might connect with a loving, concerned, interesting, interested adult. But that possibility notwithstanding, we opted to err on the side of dignity, wholeness, slowness, and unremitting joy. I will never regret that choice.

Review by David Rank
though some have fallen asleep.
Flat leaf parsley, thyme or marjoram leaves, roughly chopped to serve
Cassia has always trusted the Society to make the right choices for her: what to read, what to watch, what to believe. So when Xander's face appears on-screen at her Matching ceremony, Cassia knows with complete certainty that he is her ideal mate . . . until she sees Ky Markham's face flash for an instant before the screen fades to black. The Society tells her it's a glitch, a rare malfunction, and that she should focus on the happy life she's destined to lead with Xander. But Cassia can't stop thinking about Ky, and as they slowly fall in love, Cassia begins to doubt the Society's infallibility and is faced with an impossible choice: between Xander and Ky, between the only life she's known and a path that no one else has dared to follow.
I do believe in the existence of charms, though, and in that sense perhaps the past nine years have been charmed. I’m thinking primarily of the charms of faeries, elves, twilight folk who are scared of cold iron and crossroads and sprigs of mistletoe, anyone who dwells under hills… that kind of nonsense. I grew up accommodating large and grossly opposing sets of beliefs. I am, for example, a firm agnostic, but I think somewhere deep inside me I very much would like to believe that the ranks of seraphim, cherubim, principalities and the like really do exist. I have no idea how gravity works but I respect it. I love Greek myth, and perhaps more importantly I kinda sorta believe Greek myth, but not really. I long ago came to the conclusion that my mom was full of it for telling me not to stand in front of an operating microwave, and though it’s much more likely that I’ll die from cell phone-caused radiation afflictions than anything the microwave will produce I still watch from a distance, just in case.
The look created here is consistent, deliberate, and carried through the entire space. At the same time, it is unfitted, casual, and fits the lifestyle of the family who lives there. Making this look work is not an easy feat, and its success is due to the trained and talented eye of a designer. The palate of soothing greens and creams is anchored by hits of black, and softened by natural elements. All of the existing appliances and fixtures were maintained (even the countertops are the same!), but somehow it all looks fresh and new, and like it was "planned" to be that way. Brilliant, if you ask me.
It doesn’t end there though, because an online retailer effectively has a shop with unlimited space.

Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen and Amen.

However, that does not mean that life has stopped. Not at all! People are still creating families and are still getting married and have babies. May is the month that the Wedding Season begins. Fear not my ladies!! You don't need to spend a fortune to a dress that you will wear for a couple of hours and never again in your lifetime. The high-street retailers have some very beautiful alternatives for you that you can still wear after the big event. Besides, it is not a custom anymore for the wedding dress to pass over to the next generation, so keep it affordable and wear it again!

Now we will be talking about what John Calvin deceptively preached, TULIP. The T in TULIP stands for Total Depravity. The literal meaning of this is that as humans, every part of us is affected by sin, and we can be nothing but sinful. This is quite an exaggeration, because we know we were all saved through Jesus’ death and Resurrection. St. Paul talks about Jesus in his letter to the Ephesians, “In him we have redemption by his blood, the forgiveness of transgressions, in accord with the riches of his grace (Ephesians 1: 7)”. This shows us that we were forgiven our iniquities through Christ and his sacrificial act, and that Calvin was preaching imprudent words. Even Calvinists proclaim that total depravity is incorrect! According to James Akin, a famous Catholic writer, this is what the Calvinist’s claim: “Our free will has been injured by original sin to the point that, unless God gives us special grace, we cannot free ourselves from sin and choose to serve God in love.” James Akin also states that Catholics can believe this, because it is true we can only be freed from sin through the special grace, or mercy, of God. Total depravity was a falsehood from the start, even most Calvinists ended up changing their beliefs.

In other words, Calvin thinks a woman’s silence is not an irrevocable command from heaven but rather a “human law which is open to change” (156). If this is the case, then churches have the freedom to decide individually what is and is not consistent with order and decency in worship.
Verse 5 is key to understanding that it is talking about the church as well. It begins by saying they will have a form of godliness but will deny the power of God. The form of godliness it is speaking of is people who pretend to be christians and Godly people. It goes on to say that while they will be claiming to be Godly, they will deny the power of God. Anybody who speaks about the power of God and how he works in the world of today is looked at like they are crazy. The people even in the church have a lack of true faith in God. They do not believe he works in the world of today. The Church of Christ is the worst denomination in this category. I know because I grew up in the Church of Christ. The Church of Christ views God as a spectator, they say he won’t do such things as miracles or wrath. They assume to know the mind of God in an act of blasphemy and deny the power of God in so doing.

It keeps coming to me in Medical Intuitive sessions and meditation that we really need to offer some extra support and love to our bodies right now. I have always described the body as the soul’s lover — so dedicated and unconditional that the body will even face its own destruction and death in order to help the soul embrace its dearest hopes, dreams and lessons. This remains true, but on a much grander scale these days.

Round 2 – Frog thrusters & pike ups (no weight)
I left MCS thirty-five years ago. This morning, I returned for the first time. I went back not only to see what’s changed over the past three decades, but to see what hasn’t changed. I walked through the big green doors of the converted 1904 townhouse, into the courtyard, and up the spiral staircase to attend an Alumni breakfast and take a tour of the school. There’s a computer room there now, but that room used to be a terrace, and suddenly reverberating over the tapping of keyboards was the smack of my pink rubber handball hitting the brick wall and bouncing to Derrick. From the kitchen, I was sure I could smell Consuela’s chili and rice. In the library, my face suddenly flushed at the embarrassment of being made fun of by David, just there, at that table by the window. In the round classroom, I tasted the sweet dust from the sugar cubes we’d pasted together to make igloos. As I walked down the back staircase, I heard my own voice calling to my friends—Nicole! Nina! Betsy! Maria! Leslie!—in a race to see who could line up the fastest to go to the park with Doc. In the glorious wood-paneled music room, morning light streaming in the tall windows, I was six-years-old again, singing “We Shall Overcome Someday.” And in a corner of a small classroom with a blue rug, surrounded by fabric and glue and cardboard and pencils and crayons, I smelled the Elmer’s and felt the textured brown fabric that were to become my first hand-made book—Magic Moon and Magic Sun.
If Mulcahy had any doubts about his new job, he suppressed them by believing – or wanting to believe – that Ed Wilson was still linked to the C.I.A. ”Ed would parade his contacts in the C.I.A. with the people he was doing business with to impress them that he was still C.I.A.,” Mulcahy says. ”He would suggest he was still under deep cover.” Often on Friday nights, Wilson made it a point to go drinking at bars in suburban Virginia known to be after-hours hangouts for C.I.A. officials on duty at the agency’s headquarters in McLean. Mulcahy, the new partner, began going along. ”I thought he was agency,” Mulcahy says of Wilson. ”I had no question in my mind.”
But there are some borrowers for whom the cash flow reinvestment strategy might make sense. One is the borrower who is eligible for but not currently utilizing IRA, 401(k) or other qualified tax-deductible or tax-deferred plans. Borrowers who use their cash flow savings to invest in these vehicles, who would not do so otherwise, can earn a very high rate of return because of the tax benefits. If the borrower’s employer makes matching contributions, the return is even higher.

But, there was more than meets the eye, as there were workshops on PhD related topics such as career planning and biomedical writing. ‘How many people like to read a text for the second time, when they do not understand it the first time?’ Scientists write because they have to do so, not because they enjoy it, right? Well, some scientists might write to impress colleagues. The fact that a lot of papers are hard to read suggests that this is the case, and this writing behavior – whether good or bad – can actually even be ‘contagious’. If you take complicated writing too seriously, you could find yourself writing in a manner that is hard to read. There is an understandable, but misguided, tendency to try to also do this in abstracts, posters and presentations. This workshop and these topics encouraged me to take a critical look at my presentation again, remove excess text, and try to make everything concise and easy to read. Should you?

The manned U.S. space program had several projects to complete before they were ready to tackle landing on the moon. The Mercury and Gemini missions were needed to test out complex maneuvers that were essential for going to the moon and back. In 1964 Miles had formed one of his classic quintets and began a new phase to his music. In order to break down some of the established barriers in jazz, Miles needed a new crew to work with. One of his greatest strengths as a leader was being able to find the right musicians that would help him realize the new sounds he wanted to create. The band took off when Wayne Shorter’s saxophone and Ron Carter’s bass was joined by twenty - three year old Herbie Hancock on piano, and the even younger Tony Williams (17) playing drums.
A couple of weeks ago, i received some bad news. A very good friend of mine's mother was dignosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. Quite frankly, the signs and symptoms were only detacted within a week and before you know it, the tests was confirmed positive. It struck upon me that life is truly so short. You might have all the riches and blessings in life but you never know when God decides to take them all away.
Ojeh said he was relieved that we’d used the TKI, because he often felt bad because he didn’t think others in the team saw him as ‘pulling his weight’, and now realised that with strong personalities in the team his preferred conflict resolution style was not always in his best interests or those of his team.

Two years later, that sort of optimism has been drowned out by a dispute over the fate of “ACE 55,” the Economic Complementarity Agreement that established rules for gradually deregulating automotive trade between Brazil and Mexico back in 2003. Succumbing to protectionist pressure by Brazil, Mexico agreed this March to revise the ACE 55 agreement so that it limits surging car exports to Brazil to an annual average value of about US$1.55 billion over the next three years. Mexican automotive exporters will take a major hit: Last year, Mexican auto exports to Brazil reached 134,000 units, worth a total of $2.1 billion, up from a total of only 53,000 units to Brazil in 2009.
The Lord knew that I was the one appointed for this time. I see this clearly. But it hurts on a daily basis. I felt to keep her with me is denying her last wishes, in her life. Yet, in my more pragmatic moments, I know that it’s quality of life which counts. And there is no quality at all, if she was live, all alone in a little apartment. If I can’t get her to leave the house now, at least she has my children, my brother, me, and some people coming and going.

What is voice? I used to know. Then, from deep inside, I could hear myself screaming – inside, the rabbit’s howl disguised the pains. No one talks about the gory details of living with SCI. They talk around it. They speak in medical terms. Who are they? For me, mostly the technicians and medical practitioners, the only voices I hear with regards to my disability. My questions and the many expressions I have about my drastic new circumstance stay unexpressed, unspoken. I found early that using my voice in writing on this subject was also difficult. Writing, for the first time, produced dark writings about loss and grief. It took me to spaces I couldn’t handle yet. Sadness, fear, despair, and the reality that most of time, I was on my own – alone. Silence crept up on me like the radiating pains that come outta nowhere. There are few support groups. I guess that most SCI folk travel alone for a long time. This is my personal experience, at least. To be frank, I have never met or spoken to another living soul with a spinal cord injury. I did search online once, and found a community group for Cauda Equina, a resource center of medical, and other supportive information. I learned more about my condition. I found comrades in the battle for regaining a sense of independence. I wasn’t ready to use my voice, then. I wrote to a young 27-year old man whose sister was writing for help on his increasing depression and loss of motivation. Lie with me, the diagnosis comes unannounced, and life is thrown into a whirlwind. Most primary care physicians, where you start for any medical assessment and attempts to find out what’s going on – don’t know much. Diagnosis comes too late to intervene early enough. All of a sudden, your life is changed.
Reglan is primarily prescribed to treat nausea or to strengthen lazy stomachs that do not empty food properly into the small intestine. I have prescribed it very rarely, not from fear of side-effects, but because the drug is not very effective. In addition, even when the drug does work, it tends to lose its efficacy over time, a phenomenon that we physicians call tachyphylaxis.

Established in 1903, Mountainair soon attracted the attention of Clem “Pop” Shaffer, a blacksmith who arrived in 1908 to work his trade and sell useful items like caskets and coffins. Mr. Shaffer built a hotel out of wood which promptly burned down. So, in 1923, he built another hotel, this one out of cast concrete and various bits of iron that he collected from wherever he could. This hotel would not burn down.
This re-appraisal ofrelationships with the Church ofRome is being fed by the vitality of the charismatic movement within that church and the emergence of the Evangelical Catholic Initiative in Dublin. The acceptance of the RC Church into the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland and the enthusiasm for evangelical involvement shown by Anglican and Baptist evangelicals are likely to further soften the former lines of separation. Added to this is the unresolved political dilemma in Northern Ireland, still being blamed on religious fundamentalists who insist on perpetuating what are perceived in the popular mind as out-of-date theological distinctives. Furthermore the British media frequently portray the Anglican establishment as woolly over ethical issues while RC morality is given an unrealistically ideal press for being so uncompromised! All of which suggests that the next five years are likely to see growing social and spiritual influence for the Roman Catholic Church and more problems for those of us who question that trend.

All that being said, Dark Shadows isn't a horrible movie (though I say that having never seen the TV series and knowing that there are some pretty hardcore fans of the series who probably hated this movie). It has a lot of funny moments and even though Barnabas never becomes a fully realized character, Depp's performance is still entertaining (likewise Pfeiffer and Bonham Carter turn in good performances, and Green is a lot of fun as the villain). The special effects are excellently rendered and the prologue is a beautifully gothic tragedy which has so much promise that you expect a better movie to follow it. But as with so many of Burton's films in the last decade, all the effort seems to have gone into the style, while the other elements seem like afterthoughts. There are moments in Dark Shadows when you can see how it might have been good if it had just stuck with any one of its many ideas and followed through, but as it stands the endeavor feels a little undercooked.

Sooo... what I am walking away with is that not only is it beneficial for me to take care of myself, but that in taking care of others, there is both a physical and spiritual benefit that brings spiritual, emotional and physical peace and balance. That not only do I need to take the 5-HTP, or Holy Basil (as I am taking now), and resuming my walks and eating well, but the lack of pouring out and living as a true follower of Jesus has caused me to grow spiritually fat, the side effects of which sicken my whole being. It's as if I have come to understand the fullness of even the "benefits" of walking out my faith... that Jesus has taken to account every single detail... "that we might have life and have it to the fullest"... that's what he meant!! Even if our circumstances are terrible, that in the spirit, in our hearts, minds and emotions that we might have a fullness that supercedes all the crap in our flesh, and the focus of our flesh.

Seven titles in sixteen seasons; the football equivalent of going from 0 – 60 in 4 seconds. Arsenal pipped Preston North End on goal average (1.514 vs 1.417). The two teams met at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season when Arsenal blew their chance to seal the title by losing 0 – 2 to bring the Lancastrians level on points. Both won their final games leaving the gap between the two teams at six goals. Which over the course of a 42 game season is nothing. Preston only managed to beat Derby by a single goal on the last day of the season, nowhere near as many as might have been expected given The Rams were already relegated.

The 39 Steps is an easy blend of different tones. Hitchcock’s shadows and great shots of shocked faces remind me of Lang’s style in M, but the romance and light comedy punctuating the film keep it from getting too dark. Though Hannay’s frustration at being the wrong man could have been as desperate as a Kafka character’s, he adapts to his new role well and even begins to have fun as he learns the ins and outs of the conspiracy. Plus, Hannay is a bit of a ladies man and being handcuffed to a pretty, hard-to-get blonde seems like his idea of a good time.

At this rate you might get the entire book before I can have it exactly the way I want it. Just kidding. It will be out before Thanksgiving and I am hoping readers will purchase for their e-readers or order the paperback. As mentioned before this book is an adult book! There is a lot of violence, a lot of swearing from some very evil characters, and it is never my intention as a writer to offend. Therefore, if this kind of thriller is not your thing then please pick up a Nikki Sands book or my novel Happy Hour. They are all light, fun, and with no real violence, swearing and all that stuff.
Bless their cotton socks, they continue to make the sequel numeral an oh-so active part of the title. They also seem utterly set upon giving a sense of continuity to the franchise, so about 5 characters from the last film are transplanted to New York for this one, plus 1 character most people forgot was in the first film. AND they’ve inserted ‘in-jokes’ that only become apparent when you’re watching all the films back-to-back. Add a bizarre set of fictional universe quirks that have vagrant dancers living in a warehouse together (while running a club in the basement), a man with a boom-box implanted in his jacket (all the better to dance-duel with you see), and the ridiculous, constantly used word B-FAB (Born From A Boom-box) and you practically have half a film.

When I first started submitting for magazines, I found it really hard getting rejected. And believe me, I must have submitted hundreds of cards before I got one selected. Now, I consider rejection just a part of the process. And there could be any number of reasons why a card is not chosen. I do like to look back at the rejects and consider what was not quite right, so I thought that with each rejected card I post this week, I'd try a little analysis of why I think it wasn't chosen. And I am NOT doing this to gain sympathy :), I just want to encourage you to submit, and maybe my analysing a little might help YOU. Because getting a card chosen for publication is one of the best feelings EVER. :)
I write and revise in order. My brain does not consider it optional. Save for going back to quickly make a note, add something in one particular place, or find a specific detail, I do everything in the order it happens in the manuscript (generally chronologically, as far as it goes). For the most part, it helps me keep everything straight, remember when twists are revealed, remember which information comes when, what certain things happen in the mc's emotional arc, etc. I think it's a pretty natural way to approach things. I mean, it is how I read, after all. ;)

For years our "schooling" is a bit of a blur, I'm afraid. I was pretty young! I know that we had various school books and programs and stuff, but the only thing I can ever remember my mom actually trying to force was math. We did lots of fun science experiments, as well as watching Nova and Nature and similar shows avidly (I say we, because my sister reached school age with no one ever suggesting she go to school, so we just continued to learn together!). My mom always read aloud to us, poetry, stories, the newspaper, and I started actually reading at age 8 or 9 when she was reading Harry Potter too slowly for my taste! We never did book reports, though I'd enthusiastically tell my mom about whatever book I was reading. None of us considered that "schooling". We considered it life! I memorized poetry, and wrote both poetry and stories before I could even read (I'd narrate them to mom ;-)). My sister ad I would play spelling games for fun, and we relished our regular trips to the library, where we'd get whatever books we wanted (Emi would always max out her card, ending up with huge piles of books that my mom and I would then end up carrying, since she was too little!). Throughout this time period, my mom would tell everyone that we were doing "child-led" homeschooling.

It gives the name of Sri Krishna’s daughter (Charumathi) and Yuyutsu’s mother (Visakha)… and so much more… The two volumes are about 700 pages long but it is a limited preview edition, so you don’t have access to all the pages anyway!
To improve said situation I have two propositions. Again, I’ve prepared two lists with pro’s and con’s (Dood, do I love lists!!)

A mix of psychology, folk-tales, and words of wisdom, Women Who Run With the Wolves is a book about the importance of retaining your “wild self”, your deepest instincts where you know what is best for you. The stories she tells in this book, handed down through generations in her family, will entertain and inspire you, and stick with you long after you’ve turned the last page.
It was first published in 1964 - the year I was born. And yes, I distinctly remember having a copy of this book in my home when I was a child.
I’ve seen this band live twice and the first time I went, it was in between Hybrid Theoryand Meteora…when their shit was heavier. The fans were heavier, rougher, louder, and more fun. The second show was after Minutes to Midnight had been released…I was in college at the time. When I was in the audience, being there almost felt illegal. I was surrounded by young teenage girls that mistook their naivety for angst. They were all clad in skinny jeans, dark eyeliner, millions of those colored gummy braceletes, and Chuck Taylors. (A look I sported before it became the Emo staple).

I'm a nail biter. A serious one. I've been indulging in this (some might say disgusting) habit since I was about 5, maybe younger. I've tried about 5 billion times to quit, but I can't. I've tried acrylic nails but I really don't have time to go get my nails done every two weeks. Plus the drilling on my nails freaks me out a little. I can't seem to keep plain old nail polish on my fingers either.
So today we decided to decorate Halloween cookies and listen to Christmas music (not at the same time). The kids had a blast and LOVED the ghost and pumpkin cookies.

In terms of post- and time, on the one hand it seems like we’ve never gotten to Deleuze in that, at least how he is often utilized in the aforementioned backdrop kind of way, he’s often introduced as if he’s had no impact on theory but enacted as if everyone should already understand him. Maybe this would put a smile on Deleuze’s face as it puts his work in a kind of weird pregnant present, in a capsule of virtual time.

Any distributor will tell you it is nigh on impossible to run a business that needs to make major I.T. spends at the same time as being squeezed for margin at every front. I like to think that our company is an exception. We have been making large capital investments this year – but it is very difficult to do in a sector that is considered to be on the way out. And for the record I don’t believe that Distribution is on the way out. I believe it has to undergo a process of change in order to provide the services publishers need to engage in a world of much more diverse revenue streams. Distributors have to invest in warehouses and systems – and the best possible customer service staff – so that we can do what we have always done much better than ever before for two reasons

Designer’s notes
- And finally, and a bit perverse, I’ve found that the pressure of time has also forced me to be creative and that’s been a real eye-opener.
I don't know how much of that was factual and how much was romanticized. My guess is about 50/50. It's true that when I began writing professionally in 1997, the publishing world had become more competitive, more prone to the chain bookstores' "bestseller" mentality (leaving less space on shelves for books with smaller audiences, regardless of how well-written they might be), and more likely to give up on writers who didn't sell well out of the starting gates.
The next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look. Let it be your reminder, if you still need one, that no one – no one – ever makes it alone!

My best friend, Kelsey, and me just went camping in Joshua tree Saturday night. It was very beautiful. I love California and the crazy freeways and massive rolling rocks and cute cacti.
Now, three or four years later, I find that I am tired of learning piano music written by people who didn't understand the piano quite in the same way that Chopin did. Rachmaninoff, Brahms, Ravel, Bach. These are the composers to whom I have been dedicating nearly all of my creative and physical energies. I am not at all saying these are not amazing writers of piano music, but you have to admit, none of them can compare to Chopin. Rachmaninoff was a mystery, constantly searching. His music is never satisfied. It is an emotion. It is a nebulous, dark thing. Brahms' music is much the same way, slightly more pointed but still far from elegant or balanced. Ravel and Bach both wrote mathematically lovely pieces, their colors and harmonies incredibly gorgeous and sometimes highly complex and mystifying. AND YET, as a pianist, I had almost forgotten how utterly frustrating it was to play anything in the entire universe besides Chopin. His music does what you want it to do, it follows the natural flow of pianist expectation, and yet it does just the opposite. You are surprised, you are taken aback, you are confused, you are moved to exhaustion or breathless excitement or just plain melancholy. Whatever it is, there is nothing you can do but succumb to it.

Looking at these flowers, I’ve often been reminded of lines from D H Lawrence’s ‘Bavarian Gentians’ written when Lawrence was so aware of his own mortality. The ‘darker and darker stairs, where blue is darkened on blueness’. A poem suffused with beauty and sadness. There’s been too much sadness in the news this week, too many young lives curtailed. Locally too, the community is coming to terms with the death of a fifteen year old boy struck by a car when concerns about an unexploded WW2 shell diverted school children from their usual routes home and onto a main road. It’s all the lost potential that makes me despair.

At first he said that he was sorry I was feeling upset about it. I told him that I didn’t feel like we ever really dealt with everything. He agreed, and he said he was willing to do anything we needed to now in order to move past it. I asked him something about how everything started and about other women he had sex chats with. He completely denied there were any other women even though I had logged into his messenger account several times and seen multiple women from other parts of the country that are not his current friends and are certainly not family.

As I rounded the bend, I could see that where it's normally dry, the sea was pretty high and so I knew right then and there that I was going to get wet. While I was approaching my crossing point, another couple came down from the grass verge to my left and effortlessly crossed over without getting wet further than their knees. I clambered over a few rocks to where I thought the narrowest point would be to cross and watched the waves to get a feel for when the right time would be. I figured I'd probably just get wet up to my knees like they did. I had three-quarter pants on, but they were polyester, so no biggy - they'd dry pretty fast.
To be precise, my first experience of Wherry was at the ludicrously lovely Hunny Bell pub in the small North Norfolk village of Hunworth. I'd been on a different beer for a couple of previous nights (I was in the area on an extended stay) until a knowledgable local discretely ushered me in the direction of a neighbouring hand-pump, and a love affair began a few sips hence.
Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend.

It positively amazes me that I have been seen by scores of doctors, who all knew exactly what meds I was on, and yet not one brought up the possibility of side effects. And it's not just that; not only did the doctors not pick up on it, their response was to put me on more fucking pills, to control what was actually side effects from the pills I was on.

Drugs are bad, mmm'kay. Requiem For A Dream is a movie that I've seen frequently top "most depressing films of all time" lists, piquing my curiosity on many an occasion. A bit of cinematic misery can be good for the soul sometimes, so I approached Requiem hoping for the next Jurassic Bark or death of Buffy episode. Requiem For A Dream is very depressing. Shockingly so, sometimes. But still I was left disappointed. Maybe it's because I've seen the worst of the worst. Maybe it's because I'm an emotionless shell. Maybe it's because I've never tried drugs nor particularly liked the druggies I once called friends (if you can call someone who sits in a field on a cold winter's day smoking weed a 'druggie'). But Requiem For A Dream left me with little more than an indifferent "huh."

But “natural” and “supernatural” need not be considered as separate things. Let us bring back together the things that shouldn’t ever have been separated in the first-place – or perhaps it would be to realize that they were never separate in the first-place. Just that a hardened mind, conceived in sin, perceives this-and-that, good-and-evil, heaven-and-earth, mental-and-physical, spirit-and-flesh, gods-and-humans, etc. as these separate and exclusive things – and our minds just need to be soften, or broken.

The half-hour documentary City of Water (video trailer and more here), produced by the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance (MWA) and the Municipal Art Society (MAS), will be screened on Channel 13 today at 1:30 p.m. It's well worth a look for its portrait of an aspect of New York (especially Brooklyn) in rapid transition, its highlighting of the tensions between development and other waterfront uses, and its reminder of how we use and (too often) don't use an underrated asset.

Communication. A key question with communication is how much and to whom? Your company’s culture may dictate the model that this should mirror, but you may find that you must push the envelope. The employee’s direct co-workers should receive the first wave of communication and have a resource to consult with individually. Whether that resource is their manager, a member of the human resources department, or an outside consultant your company has provided. These resources can also be extended outside of the department. Methods of communication include one-on-one communication or a departmental meeting, but these meetings should not infringe on the privacy of your employee. Work with this individual(s) on where their comfort level lies and gauge how that fits into your organizational culture. Additional communication strategies may need to be developed with external clients and vendors, especially when a name change is involved. Lastly, if your office shares a building with other organizations, you may find that reaching out to those organizations will offset some ambiguity later on as your employee begins to use the other restroom facilities. Although this detail does not directly affect your company, it may have a direct impact on your employee who may encounter resistance via negative comments when this part of their transition is implemented.
I mainly use my blog, Twitter and Facebook but I have recently branched out and made enquiries in local book stores. Many local shops are keen to encourage and support local authors which does help.

I did not tell her that when we returned home we would set out a rat trap for the cute chipmunk. Actually, when we got home we examined the engine of our truck carefully using a flashlight.

If you have never visited the Hospice House or their grounds, I suggest that you do. It’s a beautiful place just North of downtown London on Talbot Street. The grounds lead down to the pathway’s that stretch throughout the City of London. They have the most peaceful garden behind the house. And continued support and donations of hike’s such as the Hike For Hospice every year allow the organization to keep this peaceful place alive and running for those who need some time to reflect or just rest. Although that is only a small portion of what this organization really does.

Apart from getting out there and actually moving more often we should all be taking part in some form of intense activity at least three times a week. That means getting hot, sweaty, with a raised heart rate (not what you are all thinking!!) challenging your body, increasing the intensity, progressing the exercise, changing your exercise routine or programme, mixing it up a bit. It you don’t change the exercise periodically your body will simply get used to the exercise and it will cease to provide your body with a challenge and your body will stop changing.

There is no absolute answer to how long it should take to make the repairs.

Enter the Brentford United FA (Football Association) whose members have been contracted to win every single game of their season and achieve the coveted FA Cup, lest their football field be sold off to a land developer. Since the team’s plummeting streak has held solid since the 1920′s, there seems to be little chance of saving their beloved club. But the stakes end up being far more dire. And even as the team acquires a new captain empowered to propel them to victory, member begin falling by the wayside, only to be replaced with members of a traveling circus. Still, Brentford United must win, because the alternative is the end of the world.

It seems to us that the Nuclear Security Summit was focused on the North Korea nuclear issue and on the issue of common security from a terrorist attack. Our appeal on the need for independent assessment at Reactor 4 was regarded as less urgent. We predicted this outcome in light of the nature of the Summit. I suppose most participants fully understood the potential disaster which will affect their countries. Nevertheless, they decided not to raise the delicate issue, perhaps in order not to ruffle their diplomatic relationship with Japan.

Vietnam was definitely a Cold War sideshow when I was growing up in the 1950s, or so it seemed, just another effort by the U.S. to stem the creeping Red tide of godless, monolithic Communism. The ’50s were, after all, the decade of the Korean War and the Army-McCarthy hearings. Vietnam might have been an exotic locale for the battle between freedom and slavery, but I was less aware of events there than I was of the Eisenhower Administration’s efforts to defeat Communism in Guatemala, Iran, Lebanon, and off the coast of what all of us Cold Warriors referred to as “Red China.”

Mobile marketing gurus have come to a consensus that e-commerce and mobile marketing will become a successful partnership. In 2012 we can expect to see a rise in the enhancement of mobile payment and mobile money transfers. Furthermore, there will be a rise of mobile banking in developing countries.

For instance, banking apps now make it possible to check your balance, make money transfers, pay bills and deposit checks while never stepping foot into a bank. For brands this means implementing options for mobile payment to enhance your capabilities and your consumers’ accessibility on the go.

Later I noted in verses 11-14 “When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles, but when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray. When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?”
So I pass time at the nursery and the plants do their part in keeping me sane. But once in a while, it's the plants that also drive me to insanity. I'm talking specifically about my recent acquisition of an Asian pear tree here. There were no outside forces at work that resulted in it now residing on my patio- only me and the tree. In the moment before I brought it home, I was entranced by it. (My husband, and possibly my neighbours, who I dragged into the garden to admire the tree the moment I got it home, and maybe even some folks out there on Facebook, may argue that the trance lasted all night.) Am I crazy, or did this tree speak to me?

Jane, explained why the Dixie Highway is the best bargain hunting in America: "You have to understand, Florida is a big drain. As people downsize and retire South, they bring their favorite things. Eventually, a lot of it ends up on the Dixie Highway. " High and low Palm Beach style flows down the alluvial layers of possession. Remnants of great castles and estates mingle with common rubbish. Chinioserie, hand painted furniture, Italianate pieces, paintings and ceramics are heaped together, quite unlike Worth Avenue, a few miles away. The rule of thumb is: The more jumbled the shop, the better the buy. You have to sift for the gold, ignoring the prevalent common objects. Lighting can be dismal, chairs sit on tables, upon tables, and precious antiques are dusty.

I am struggling to strike a balance these days: there is all this lovely, inexpensive fresh summer produce to prepare for myself and my family in our effort to eat wholesome, healthful, non-fake food - but that takes time, planning and effort. There is my desire to preserve all the vegetable and fruit loveliness for when there is much less of it available. There is my struggle to get a decent amount of exercise, while simultaneously having a rugrat of one size or another tethered to my leg saying "mommy" over and over. There is the necessity to keep up with my job outside the home; I am fortunate that I works for a great company and awesome people, who understand the mom thing and allow me work flexible hours-but that can mean it occasionally spills over into my "at home" hours. Factor in basic hygiene, sleep, laundry, household care for me and the family, and I have got nothing left at the end of the week.
Multiple combat
Even in betrayal, arrest, mockery and crucifixion his apparent weakness is in fact a stiff resolve to trust in God for his defence and vindication; a faith in God that gave him the courage to face even death believing that God could save him even from even this the ultimate enemy. By facing the ultimate enemy Jesus leads us to ultimate victory, even victory over the grave.

It has been an exciting week in which I spent two days, alongside Alan from Argenta-Europ in Brussels meeting the other members of the consortium. After waiting months to hear, it has finally been confirmed that we have been successful in our bid to deliver an FP7 project on behalf of the European Union. Our particular project is “Empowering European Aeronautical SMEs to Participate in EU Research” for which the abstract explains:
Wisdom feeds the creation of value. Cleverness too often engenders a world controlled by parasites who create no value, but instead, employ every form of violence, murder, destruction and manipulation to usurp value from those who create value. Hemp is a paragon of wisdom—of fitting perfectly into and furthering Earth’s living energy systems. Hemp could shield the wisdom in humanity from the parasitical cleverness driving us down the road of perpetual war, toward utter biospheric collapse.

For him to get bail someone had to put up a surety – a backup in case he did a bunk. Because I believed him innocent and the cops arresting him had openly broken the law, I put up my house as security. The bail was set at £1,500 – the house was only worth £11,000, so a pretty hefty bail amount. A week later he was back in the same court and his face was still all blue from the bruises. Trial date was set for a few months later.
While not the best look, PRIME nonetheless offers a clear, bright, consistent look. Unlike what happens far too often in the movies, it’s clear to tell the robots apart here. As the 5-part series unfolded, the animation grew on me enough that even if I didn’t come to love it, I certainly don’t hate it.
I really enjoyed this book, this book is not like all the other books on this subject, Meberg uses her own life as examples to times she has wanted more and has only found peace in God. This book is challenging and causes you to refocus your energy and realize what you are truly craving, not things of this world but only what God can provide.
This won’t have any major impact on campaigns or broadcast outlets, since the information already must be made public on request under existing rules.

“It is important that the removal of one of those does not make liquidation actually more likely.” That is an odd sentence, I feel. Of course having two bidders is better than one as there is more prospect in a normal case of the bidders competing to raise the price – that does not seem to have been the case here.

First off, our Arabic Numerals actually came from India. That's right. All the Muslims did was transport them over on the trade routes. I've come lately to question other Scientific achievements Muslims have brought us as well. Why? Look at the technology levels in Muslim countries. They were like that, even before European Imperialists came into town. And Muslims were the ones who destroyed hundreds upon hundreds of Alchemical and Scientific texts when they burned down the Library at Alexandria.

The Review: If you’re into movies with a very strong dose of the weird, the bizarre, the erotic, the Fantastique, or that otherwise engage the emotions that Hollywood shies away from; it’s hard to do much better than the works of the late French director Jean Rollin. Rollin was an artist with his own unique vision; one that he worked hard and made sacrifices to bring to the screen. His best works (and even many of his more obviously flawed offerings) play like they were shot in a dream; scenes straight from the realms of the subconscious that have a bizarre logic all their own, and that resonate emotionally with the viewer on a far deeper level than most movies have any hope of coming close to.

Turning to her right, Ariela focused on the smallest sleeping lump. She pulled a strip of fabric from her right cargo pocket and wadded it into a small ball. Treading carefully, Ariela made her way to the southwest corner of the building where the younger of the two girls lay sleeping. Ariela’s vision had adjusted to the filtered moonlight. She could see that the little girl was sleeping on her side. Ariela reached out with her right hand while holding the balled up rag in her left. The girl muttered in her sleep. Ariela gently closed off the girl’s nostrils with her right hand while holding the cloth at the ready with her left. When the girl’s mouth opened, Ariela slid the piece of cloth into her mouth and then released her nostrils.

I recently stumbled across your site. The Ex South African situation can truly be called a diaspora. I am not a regular contributor on the other sites but I read the views of SAS with much interest and I have been searching for the right platform to add my little bit, so here goes. I worked in Joeys and saw all the crap going on there. Strikes, marches, the unwashed masses gaining ground. Plainly saw the hypocrisy of big business and vested interests taking hold. Saw the backbone being removed from the country. I could not swallow the NSA when it came to crunch time. It was Ok to “embrace” it and all that, but about 2 years ago, something inside me clicked. Due to large scale rationalisation in the org I worked at, it was becoming clearer to me that things were going seriously fast down the slippery slope to oblivion (or if not outright oblivion, certainly things were dumbing down to the lowest common denominator pretty quickly.) Added to that, I was 38 and I realised that I had to make a choice: Either make peace with the NSA and swallow it all. But if I stayed any longer, the window of opportunity would close on me soon, so I decided to change EVERYTHING in my life and move to the UK . Not easy, but a pretty good mid-life crisis to get going on. I think a false society is being created there in SA. Masculinity is being denigrated and is despised. The pendulum has swung too far the other way. There is no free association in SA. Man was I gatvol!
There are so many options at the grocery store today and already so many labels to read and ingredients to look out for, we don't need anymore confusion by trying to figure out if 2 oz of peanut butter is worth an extra 60¢.

Answer: I’ll let you know if I hear of one. Even if they won’t eat it, they can still snap off all the leaders or mar it in some other conspicuous way before determining the tree is not snack worthy (my poor, poor Prunus maackii trees will never be the same). Stick with evergreens, kid, and you may have a chance.

A couple of months ago, my sister LC came out for a weekend to visit Miss B and me while DP was off doing his thing for the month of March. As usual when LC visits, much jollity ensued, as well as copious amounts of goofing off.

The Burnaby Pathfinders returned for a Sunday work out and as usual there smiles lite up both the pigs and mine day. They planted a few privacy bushes for me, swept the driveway, helped load the truck for a dump run, fixed fences and picked up manure from the horses pasture.

This is where one might verge into messy Messianic interpretations of a text. I encourage the reader to use their wisdom here. I believe everything I write, but I have to weed out a lot of trashy, bad hermeneutics which others include in their interpretation of Scritprue so that I may present valid arguments to the reader.
This means your closets, drawers, pantry, etc. Just focus on one if it’s too overwhelming to consider them all. Pick one closet that would greatly improve your life if it was not stuffed to the rafters. Spend 30 minutes (or two hours) pulling down everything and deciding whether it’s giveaway, throw away or keep. If it’s throwaway, put it in a trashbag and take it out of the house. If it’s giveaway, put it in the car to take to a charity, or call a charity right away for pick-up. Or list it on Freecycle. Whatever. Just get rid of it instantly, so you don’t start thinking about what you banished and let it creep back in . Aim to have at least one shelf completely clear. Remember that Feng Shui thing I said before about keeping an open shelf.

No one has the art of socialization down, and I don’t think anyone ever will. Each person you interact with is just so different, each shaped by his or her past relationship experiences.

The next thing I tackled was under the sink. We recently remodeled our kitchen, and I have been looking and looking for the product that was "just right" to organize all of my cleaning supplies and stockpile of dishwasher detergent, sponges, etc. Let me tell you, it is harder to find something than you would think! I never found something that worked for us. One day I was browsing around on Pinterest and found a great idea for putting a tension rod into your cabinet to hold spray cleaners and it hit me. That was all I really needed! This way, the cleaners that I use everyday would be front and center, and I could use one side for my stockpile of detergent, and the other side could house my household cleaners that I use less often.
Find it in: Whole grains such as oatmeal, bran, and barley, as well as fruits and vegetables, and legumes. Some of these foods also contain other compounds such as phytochemicals, vitamins, and trace minerals, which may help fight heart disease–another reason why fruits, vegetables and whole grains frequently top nutritionists’ lists of recommended foods.

To say those type of things; in a, in a, we’re in a situation right now where racism is just huge. But to say those type of things. You can’t say that. You can’t say that. And all I called was for advice. I didn’t ask to be beat up. And personally attacked. And personally attacked, you know.

I disconnected. Put everything on mute and my heart longed to connect . Just for a while. Just with you. To be there. For a short time. Just as it longed for the boys. Loneliness cuts deep. It swallows you completely. I guess that is the way it IS, to be there and let it take over. To feel it, observe it, endure it. Loneliness shelters in this unconditional hurt. You curl in and feel safe in its nets.
On October 26, 2011, a number of US steel companies simultaneously filed a petition to the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and the US International Trade Commission (ITC) for anti-dumping and countervailing duty on circulate welded carbon steel pipes imported from several countries, including Vietnam. On November 15, the DOC determined to officially carry out the anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations for these products.

From that seat, you watch the meat wagons arriving full of bloodied drunks, pensioners disoriented after falls, people on bad drug trips. If you’ve read me, you’ll know I’m not squeamish. But at times even I’ve needed to turn away from what was being wheeled down that corridor outside Majors. I’ve also winced at the shrieked claims of inebriated girls about what they took or what they definitely didn’t do with whom. Some of them, sad to say, are young enough to read my children’s books. I’ve shrunk away from the huddles of defensive friends, hustling the fumes of their night’s drinking through the disinfected air. Almost worse is the occasional querulous posh person who turns up with a finger-tip lopped off in a gin-and-gardening incident. They bray their needs imperiously, oblivious to the exhaustion of the staff or the less socially entitled who might be ahead of them in the queue.
Seed wise, I think str seeds are a standard, but resilience seeds for pvp could also be beneficial. If you think you'll be facing other ninjas, maybe more agility could help you edge them out, but it doesn't seem needed that much.

This may not be an easy power to enforce with Mitt Romney as he is first and foremost the Mormon’s choice for President and as such he has as many bullies behind him as Grover Norquist has. It is no accident that his dad ran for the same office and his Mom ran for the Senate. A great deal of Corporate America is owned by the Mormon Church or dependent on Baine Capital and Company to restructure their businesses, so they will agree on Tax cuts for the wealthy and removing restrictions on Wall Street and Corporate America along with denying women birth control through their own insurance policies, since the Mormon Church bans it out right.

The rep's job has got a lot harder in recent years. Every year, redundancies and early retirement have trimmed the sales forces of publishers and the surviving reps have been expected to cover ever larger areas for little or no extra pay. The once ubiquitous HarperCollins rep is now as elusive as the natterjack toad.
I have only two rules I am following this year.
FA: Who knows? You never know. I think it is difficult to have any prediction of what could have happened without the problems of Sebastian. For sure more difficult and you need to overtake on the track and when you are talking about two or three-tenths different pace in favour of them or us it is not easy to overtake as we saw with the McLaren and for Sebastian it was the same when he tried to overtake Lewis. It is not easy to overtake so the pit-stop problems for them was a help. But the same every race. Maybe in Canada it was a different thing also for Jenson. He won the race and we retired. The races are the way it comes.

Yesterday, after Santa was done talking to That Other Kid and he was about to see his next little ones Santa asked if he knew why we celebrate Christmas. I'm not sure if Santa asks every child this or not but I loved That Other Kid's response - "We celebrate Christmas because it's Jesus' birthday!" That warmed my heart and made me thankful for the privilege of being his mom! Indeed Jesus is the reason for the Season!
You have been wonderful and you let me in. I felt it A... Don't write it off. Don't reduce us to just something of the past that you want to get over as soon as possible. I know how you can shut off. You told me and I've seen you do it. I could probably do something about that if I were there. But then we might not be facing this, if that were the case.
As I read the gospels, especially during the events of Holy Week, I find myself trying to identify with the various disciples. Sometimes I well with pride thinking I would behave like John who stayed at the foot of the cross up until the very end, even committing to take care of the Savior’s mother. Other times, I can relate to Peter who was boastful about his commitment only to find himself hovering outside the courtyard telling others adamantly that he was NOT one of Jesus’ followers. Or maybe I’m one of the other unnamed disciples whose actions are not recorded in the pages of Scripture. Unlike Peter who was still hanging around, were these guys all waiting in the shadows to watch their Teacher’s fate from a “safe” distance? Or did they just know this was the end and unless they wanted it to be the end for them, too, they had better go find a safe place to hide? Perhaps that same upper room where they had shared the last supper and Jesus had given his final example of instruction by washing their feet? And then there is Judas. Here is today’s text from Mark 14:12-25.
Neither did Angelo Depoli, arrested the day of the murder with a blood covered curved knife used for chopping bananas in his barn. A year later the family dog was still being sought as a witness. Detroit police were so desperate to solve the crime they tried to pin it on a man who escaped from a lunatic asylum and was presumed killed by a freight train two years BEFORE the crime. They didn’t have much, but they did have a pair of bloody fingerprints from the door latch. They were figured prominently in the bulletin from Superintendent of Police James Sprott along with the reward of one thousand dollars which was distributed far and wide to no avail.

There is a particular genius in a song like “At Home He’s A Tourist”, the band’s defining and most recognizable song. Over a galloping bass line that is wholly memorable , with sparse, effective drumming, the guitar of Andy Gill shrilly screams in short spurts over top, and they intone in their special speak singing about how people are literally making themselves ill to match up to the ideal that politicians and media have deemed to be the new normal.

The murder case of the three black male adults who are accused of murdering the captain of the Westonaria High School team, Louwrens Gebhardt, 18, has been transferred out of the Westonaria Regional Court, to the Magistrate’s court in Protea Soweto – purportedly because the investigating police feared that the murdered young man’s father -- a retired police officer -- ‘could influence the court proceedings in Westonaria.

Are these sheep seeing something we can’t? After all, spectral residents are said to wander the Denbigh Moors in North Wales. Perfect, because we ventured high into the Denbigh Moors for a chance to visit its haunted house, a hunting lodge, now in ruins, known locally as Gwylfa Hiraethog*. Gwylfa Hiraethog, or the Watch Tower of Hiraethog gets its name from the Denbigh Moors (Mynydd Hiraethog in Welsh). I looked for a definition of “Hiraethog” and found that it could be translated as “yearning” or “great longing.” What I don’t know is what came first, the great longing or the ghosts. Either way, the name seems apt.
Phew... this week seemed to drag on and on. This was partly due to the fact that Brandon had to work 60 hours this week and had meetings every night too. Also, Kendra had something that upset her tummy and poor baby woke up sick in the middle of the night. She had no fever and seemed fine otherwise, but she didn't want momma out of her sight. So, I slept on the floor next to her crib. I think I got maybe three hours of sleep and they weren't consecutive. :( I did learn a fun fact, though. She can crawl out of her crib now. Oh no! I am sensing many more sleepless nights to come!

“Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, the (Rothschild) brothers conducted important transactions on behalf of the governments of England, France, Prussia, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Naples, Portugal, Brazil, various German states and smaller countries. They were the personal bankers of many of the crowned heads of Europe. They made large investments, through agents, in markets as distant as the United States, India, Cuba and Australia.” – G. Edward Griffin
Considering that most of the plant life on Earth gains its energy from sunlight, you can expect that during the time of year where the Earth’s position around the sun gives you a longer exposure to sunlight; that the plant life around you is going to produce extra deposits of energy (generally in the form of fruit, flowers or pollen which leads to the growth of new plants). The increased sunlight also means that the days will become warmer. Animals will start to mate during this time as it gives their offspring a better chance to survive their first few months of life as they can stay warm and there is a larger supply of food on offer than in the colder half of the year. There’s the fertility aspect of “Mother Nature”.

The Woman is a highly divisive movie, but one you need to see for yourself before you condemn it. For me, it's one of the best horror movies of the year.
Next, make an easy ranch coleslaw. In a bowl, combine 2 Tbsp mayo, 2 Tbsp sour cream, 2 Tbsp milk and 1/2 tsp of each: salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder. Stir well and pour over 2 cups shredded cabbage or coleslaw mix. You could also just use your favorite premade ranch dressing (but this is better, trust me).

Guess what?! Our adoption story was just featured in Docica magazine! I was pretty excited when I was asked about being included in this month's issue (I mean, it's a magazine!), but I was even more excited when the issue published and I got to read it. The article about us and our adoption story was great, but I'm here to tell you about a few more bits of goodnesss. I'd never heard of Docica. Have you? They describe themelves as a 'simple living magazine about real beauty'. You've got to check them out. They talk about fashion, home decor, recipes, and features on beautiful real women. This month is the adoption issue and there are some great articles. There's even an article about Give1Save1 (the site that we were blessed to be a part of that encourages people to give $1 each week to an adopting family), so check that out! (they're on pg. 57-58)
Art is so subjective, so emotional, so personal.
All these propaganda tools are seriously compromised were one of the four presumed ‘solid’ votes for the mandate to flip, especially an obama appointee. Then the story line goes: ‘This guy devoted the entire first year of his term to getting this law passed,and now it’s wiped off the books. He wasn’t smart enough to realize it had constitutional issues, nor could he even pick the right judge to uphold it.’

We suffered through all that with him. So when this book started out and he falls in immediately lust with a sometimes "dancer", I was dubious. When we find out this said "dancer" is also his ex's little sister, all my red flags went up. I'm not a big fan of the little sister of the ex girlfriend having had a crush on the guy since forever and then all of a sudden they can make a relationship work.

Video camera camcorders are great for shooting videos of memorable events and occasions; and even spontaneous happenings that you would want to document in film. There are pocket camcorders as well as full feature ones; and your choice depends on how you want the videos to come-out, whether standard or high definition; and the kind of portability that you would want in your camera.
This latest bizarre development follows continued criticism and a litany of unfolding scandals of child sexual abuse perpetrated by priests in the Catholic Church in Ireland, England and the USA over many decades. The Catholic Church has been accused by many of its abused victims, as children, that they were sworn to pacts and oaths of secrecy to enable the church to protect the perpetrators and facilitators, and priests alleged to have committed acts of abuse were simply moved from community to community.

For Wolfe, the supposition is that these are personal copies, and by going over personal copies with a fine tooth comb and with loving attention, the objects are resurrected, edified, and the simple joys of living are revealed as enough because they are capable of holding our attention. “Our personal copy of Voltaire or Stein,” according to Carter Foster’s account of Wolfe in the LACMA Catalogue, “represents our own intersection with the greatness of culture.”
Did you know that apostasy is effectively illegal in Malaysia? Did you know that non-Muslim rights such as haram food processing facilities (like abbatoirs) not too distant from wet markets, assigned non-Muslim places of worship (there are none assigned but Muslims alwas get their assignments of land for Mosques), avenues to gambling other than 4D, meaning Cards, Dice, Dominos, Mahjong, Roulettes, Jackpots, etc.. – at one time even Mahjong during Chinese New Year was disallowed) though legal limits on losses should be implemented alongside – as of now all the above are only available in a single mega-sized venue of few, most prefer small venues in convenient places) in an inaccessible place, as well as lack of proper adult services avenues and legislation of formal Red Light Districts, are effectively disallowed as well or immensely difficult to get the state governments to assign?

He pointed out that the Syrian Government is shouldering the greatest responsibility in maintaining the security, stability and sovereignty of the country, yet it will not be able to do that if the international community doesn’t ask all parts to ceasefire and give the international observers a chance and move to the political dialogue.
OK...it's really about the wallpaper. I was introduced not long ago to Eskayel. Eskayel is a Brooklyn, NY company founded only a few years ago by designer Shanan Campanro, who artfully imagines unique new patterns for wallpaper, fabrics and area rugs. What I love? Her wit and humor...and of course her style. Her wallpaper makes me grin.....like the dog.

The four mothers photographed by Schoeller were all familiar with The Baby Book, but adopted the parenting philosophy for their own reasons. For Grumet, the decision was a natural extension of how she’d been raised; she was the daughter of attached parents and her older sister also practices the method as well. “I grew up this way and never thought about raising my kids differently,” she says.

She's 14 and you haven't had "the talk"? You wouldn't have gotten away with that had she gone to school outside your home. Not that that is a bad thing, but any second, she could walk out your front door and be very, very unprepared for life as the rest of us know it.

It's not a bad book. I enjoyed reading it. I think you should definitely read Kitchen Confidential first. It's been recommended that I also read A Cook's Tour, so I'm going to keep an eye out for that.
Why is this? I suspect the answer lies in the Mayoral system itself and the way it makes it harder for people to build a reputation in local politics.

The reason why they are Blessed is because only when we have these attitudes can we truly see ourselves for who we are and God for who He is. Only when we see the depravity of our being and the sin that enslaves us, can we be set free by the only ONE that is Pure and Holy! May He grant us the privilege of being called BLESSED by Him because in us are found the Be-Attitudes.
Before the Google era, I used to go to library for my questions and always felt that I would find answers there. When I was bored or down or happy, library was the place to go and day would pass just like that. I remember browsing through huge encyclopedias and pictures books that would have been too expensive to buy and learning lot of stuff. Then there were some not very popular sections but hiding some really great books. Most of these libraries had restriction on number of books one could borrow and that was the most tricky part. At the end of library visit, I would always have too many books and then I had to choose the best and then hope that when I visit next time, I will still be able to find the remaining ones.

Gabe essentially took us through a process of Focus (what brings us here), Vision (where we are heading), Change (what needs to change to help us get there) and Action (what we will do to help us get there). I loved his facilitation and I can see the potential of the process, and at the same time it reinforced for me that I do love an asset-based approach.

Usman backed up his taxi before turning onto the highway. There were only a few people on the streets and it was not difficult to imagine why. Since the night of 26/11 television channels were falling over each other to beam live ‘exclusive’ footage of the unfolding attacks and even as I got into Usman’s old taxi that Friday morning television was beaming live the counter-terrorism effort underway at the Taj. It was in it final stages.

This is a new piece I am working on. "Doll Maker" (oil on canvas) continues on a recent theme that I've been developing. The art and craft of doll making is quite fascinating, and not too removed from painting either. It combines the disciplines of sculpture, painting, sewing, and fantasy. It is like a painting come to life that you can hold, or a sculpture that you can dress and pose. The hair can be combed, and the glass eyes can be any color you like them to be.

The word saudade is a Portuguese-Galacian word that has no true equivalent in the English language. Wiki calls it a "deep emotional state of nostalgic longing" for someone, or something absent. Saudades are woven in the fabric of Brazilian music (I've shared one below). There is a fine, in-depth write about saudade at wiki here. However, I get the feeling that it can never really be understood by anyone who doesn't come from a culture where it is profoundly felt by its entire people. For instance, Brazil has a day of saudade on January 30, out of longing for the Portuguese homeland. I only recently discovered the word, and its melancholy and provenance have put me in a state of saudade for saudade, it is so beautiful. I find this helpful from wiki:

Don't get me wrong though, I don't look down at all on people who don't feel the need to wear brand. In fact, I sometimes wish I wouldn't care so much about it. But once you start to care, it's very hard to turn back again. Especially if you're already a shopping addict, like me.

I knew clearly that to be the best father I can be for my daughter, I must honor my true self. I may always be a square peg, but that peg is a worthy soul that is deserving of respect...especially from myself.

Please, if you want to comment, comment, if you want to email me or call me, I'd love to speak with you. If you still think, after all this, that I am crazy and wasting my life and my life... so be it. I will be praying for you because, dear friend, I would hate for you to die and spend eternity in Hell. And you know what, if I'm wrong and this whole Jesus thing isn't true... at least I lived my life having hope and faith in something that caused me to think beyond myself and positively impact people around me.
Now choose the highest F number your camera allows you to choose and take another photo. Everything will be in focus. Front- and background. Your shutter speed will be noticeably longer (try to keep your camera still), because the lens opening will be much smaller, allowing less light into the camera. Your camera will keep the lens open for longer to allow enough light into the camera to get a decent photo. If your photo is too dark, try a lower F number and then even a lower F number. You’ll see the difference.
It's worth contemplating that the concept of envy found itself in the ten commandments(don't do it)and in I Corinthians 13(it's not love). In a strictly materialistic view of the world, which is arguably the predominate American view inside and outside of christianity, well-being is reduced to materialism, and compassion to material based "fairness". Such a view is a petri dish for envy. It denies the twin possibilities of happiness without wealth and wealth without happiness because in materialism, happiness and wealth are synonymous.

I think the reason this all bothers me so much is that it really feels like another failure on my part. I failed first time round to have a live baby and now I have what I've wished for I've failed to manage it without falling apart. In my darker moments I sometimes think losing J@cob was my warning. My hold it there you really shouldn't be doing this, you're just not cut out to have a baby, warning That's how I feel, like I don't deserve to have Emily, like I've let her down in some way. How can you get what you wished for and end up so messed up?
It is the exactly the same with honour killings and forced marriages, that dishonest rag the Daily Mail may try to pretend such things are regular occurrences within our own culture by illustrating an article about forced marriages with a picture of a glum looking blonde woman in a white wedding dress or attempting to equate honour killings, where various Asian family members, usually fathers and brothers, but sometimes also mothers will murder a daughter, or occasionally a son, who has brought dishonour on the family, usually by adopting western values, with “domestic violence”.
Centrica, owners of British Gas, warned wholesale costs were up 15 per cent on last year. The UK’s biggest supplier, which has nearly 16 million customers, said other costs such as transport would add a further £50 per household to the cost of supplying gas and electricity.
Which leads me to the second element of the school garden that I’m really excited about: the kids love it. We worried a lot before we began last year about the children walking on the soil and over the plants. They’d had free rein for years in the terraced beds we planned to plant, but after getting involved preparing the soil, making signs, growing seedlings, planting seedlings and seeds, and watching the garden grow, almost every kid in the school respected the garden enough not to tread on the plots. They feel ownership, and many of the kids (my own 7-year-old included) consider themselves guardians of the garden and warn others against messing with the soil.

I pulled most of the lettuce as it is finally going to seed, and the Kale is looking awesome! I'll wait until after the first frost to process that.
I am also very RELIEVED! You see, I have homeschooled Ruby since pre-school and had a lot of people who were convinced I was going to turn her into this backward little weirdo who spent all day hiding in the basement, talking to her imaginary friends... (That would actually be ME and I went to public school.) Instead she turned into an intelligent, beautiful lady who regularly wears out the batteries on my phone. Where is this quiet, antisocial kid these people promised me?!!! They ought to have to pay our phone bill! Sheesh.... LOL If the other 3 munchkins grow up to be even half this awesome I will die a happy mama! ;o)
On one hand, you've got the rather homely Karen Carthwright (Katherine McPhee, previously of American Idol), a mid-western gal living in New York with her English boyfriend (Raza Jaffrey) who makes an impression on Julia and company by actually turning up to the audition not dressed as the movie icon and belting out a popular Christina Aguilera song before getting a second audition of sorts with Simon Cowell lite director Derek (Jack Davenport). The same audition where her sexy routine resulted in her not bonking him for the part. Countering that, you've got the more ambitious Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty), who I have to admit I found ten times more interesting than Karen as a character.
In the early 1960s, Ellington embraced recording with artists who had been fierce rivals of the past, or who had been young artists from the Bebop beginnings whom he did not associate with. The Ellington and Count Basie orchestras recorded together. During a period when he was between recording contracts he made records with Louis Armstrong (Roulette), Coleman Hawkins, John Coltrane (both for Impulse) and participated in a session with Charles Mingus and Max Roach which produced the Money Jungle (United Artists) album.

Can we determine who was speaking to Paul? Of course we can. It was the Lord Jesus Christ because of what we read in verse 19. Saul of Tarsus had been persecuting those who believed in Christ. All Jews believed in God, the Father but they had rejected those who believed in Christ.
I'm fresh off the red eye from sunny California, where I spent the last couple days at a conference attending back to back informational seminars and interactive breakout sessions (hence no blogging).

So, by monistic idealism, I made it clear that, no, I don’t mean that dualistic kind of Western idealism, but really a monistic idealism, which has existed in the West, but only in the esoteric spiritual traditions. Whereas in the East this is the mainstream philosophy. In Buddhism, or in Hinduism where it is called Vedanta, or in Taoism, this is the philosophy of everyone. But in the West this is a very esoteric tradition, only known and adhered to by very astute philosophers, the people who have really delved deeply into the nature of reality.

Muslims: Listen–you will not be able to get every human being in the world to convert to Islam. It is an impossibility. We all have different ideas about everything. Instead of murdering people, blowing up buildings and people, and giving the world reasons to despise you, why don’t you try a new approach? How about trying to entice people to convert to Islam instead of forcing them? How about showing the world how loving and forgiving Allah is? Give us reasons to admire you and your religion. The way you are acting now, you are only giving non-Muslims reasons to hate you. We can all live together in peace, if you will allow it. What kind of god would tell his followers to murder everyone who follows a different religion? Is that a loving and forgiving god? I think not.
In 1673, King Louis XIV decided to re-cut the diamond to enhance its brilliance (the previous cut had been to enhance size and not brilliance). The newly cut gem was 67 1/8 carats. Louis XIV officially named it the "Blue Diamond of the Crown" and would often wear the diamond on a long ribbon around his neck. The Hope Diamond was eventually inherited by Louis XVI, according to the legend, Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI were beheaded during the French Revolution because of the blue diamond's curse.
So I wait. If this doesn't work out, I'll be disappointed, but good will come out of it. I've realized I really am ready to move on. I don't think I want to go to another firm. I've gained some interview practice. I've updated my resume. I'll just have to keep looking.

And that’s where I stopped. I couldn’t figure out how to get back to the main idea. I wasn’t even still sure the main idea had enough meat to make a full blog out of it.

Method: Mix soya sauce, ginger, garlic, red chilli powder, turmeric powder and a few drops of water to make a smooth and thick paste. Marinate the fish pieces in this paste for approximately 15-20 minutes or more to get an exotic flavor. Meanwhile, beat up the eggs and season it with the pepper and the remaining salt. Drain out the excess marinade from the fish pieces, dip it one at a time in the egg mix, and then roll in the bread crumps plus flour powder. Pat the mixture firmly onto the fish pieces. Heat up the mixture of oil and ghee till smoking hot and deep fry the fish fingers on either side until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve with ginger, garlic, mint chutney or any of your favorite sauces or dips. Enjoy!
We are just missing so many opportunities and I’m anxious to see the vatican website start to embrace them. It’s exciting that they are beginning to do that. I just hope it continues and in the right direction. I got mad love for them.

Once I finish the goat book, I'll move on to the "to read" pile that I keep on my writing desk (unless another library book catches my eye, in which case I'll read that first!). Right now, the pile is focused heavily on the practical. Stacked up to the side of my computer, I have: Quite a Year for Plums, by Bailey White; We Wanted a Farm, by M.G. Kains; Everything I Want to Do Is Illegal, by Joel Salatin, Nourishing Traditions, by Sally Fallon (yep, it's a cookbook - but it has a lot of "extra" information that I want to read through), and Singer's Sewing Step-by-Step. Which reminds me - we've got the sewing machine threaded and working, so now I just need to figure out how to make something useful. So far, I'm still working on mastering "sewing a straight and even line" :)
At Webster University’s Academic Resource Center there are endless ways a student can get help with anything and succeed in life.

With his green eyes and dirty-blond hair, and a cheeky smile that could melt a girl’s heart all the way over in the back row, he’d been the cute member of the band with boyish good looks that had drawn him a fan club from all over the world. Cal hadn’t been able to put a foot wrong during their hey day. Popular didn’t even begin to describe him, and whenever he’d taken lead vocals on stage the place had erupted with the sounds of thousands of over-emotional girls begging him to take them home and do whatever he wanted to them. Which he had done. Sometimes. As long as he’d been certain they were old

Did about 49 mins on Wii Fit and then ran over to my parents to do another 30 mins on the elliptical. I have to say, I've never done an elliptical machine before, I find it very nice not having knee and foot pain while doing exercises. But man oh man my quads were screaming yesterday when I woke up. But I pushed on.

The more I denied that the overweight stranger in the photos was me, the more weight I gained. My body stopped looking like a chunky hourglass and started looking like a fat person. I no longer felt comfortable showing off my figure and started to wear clothes that hid my best features rather than highlighting them. Shopping became more frustrating as I was no longer able to shop average size racks and had to start looking in the plus sections. Finding clothes that didn't make me feel like an old bag lady became increasingly difficult. I kept putting stakes in the ground when it came to weight gain. The first stake was 200lbs. I decided that if I reached 200lbs, I would start making drastic changes. I'm not even sure when I hit 200lbs, but I have a feeling it was somewhere during a point in time when I was too consumed with work to implement any real changes. The next time I was able to think about my health, the stake was moved to 230lbs. It wasn't until I reached 260lbs that I actually started to take control of my health and make real changes happen.
What else might the news presenter have been implying by her comment that there was a ‘pride issue for the soldiers’? There is a small chance that she was implying that having a mental breakdown is shameful. This is unlikely since today a fundamental shift in attitude is gradually taking place, and people are realizing that everyone is vulnerable to mental health challenges owing to the condition of being humanly fallible, and that people can and do recover.
On Friday, I spent a couple of hours at the park with the girls. This is a nice park in one of the more upscale areas of my town. It's not the kind of place where one would expect to see graffiti on the bathroom walls, cigarette butts on the sidewalks, or evidence of teenage liasons left behind that almost certainly would provoke children to ask some very uncomfortable questions. And most of the people who visit this park fit right in with its wholesome feel. Most people. Then there is the family I saw last week. It was a young couple, late teens maybe, and their little boy who looked like he was about three years old. This sweet child that was running around happily, blissfully unaware that he is the offspring of morons, was wearing a t-shirt that had "Future Pimp" scrawled right across the front. Really? Seriously? Why would a parent do that?!

When I look around, I see females chasing men more and more. I have no problems with assertive women or going for what you want in life, but what I’m seeing is more than assertive women. These ladies are getting aggressive. It seems that males are so used to getting chased these days that they do not want to put forth the effort to claim a less assertive woman.

What I do care about, is the misguided notion that someone who may be averse to a smoking permitted environment, is encouraged by extremely wealthy non-profit “charitable organizations” with highly questionable ties to the pharmaceutical industry, to believe that they somehow have a constitutional right to dictate whether a property or business owner allows smoking on property where the smoke-averse individual is under no obligation to be in the first place, nor under any restraint or restrictions to remain.

Years later I was reading a book to my daughter that had dinosaur colors on one side and then you flipped the book over and it had dinosaur numbers on the other side. It occurred to me that, while this type of book format (which I now know is called Tête-bêche) was interesting, this particular book didn't take the concept all the way. After all, they just stuck two books together. So I had a flash of inspiration that you could use this format to tell one story from two different perspectives and I even came up with the title in the same breath. It took me a few days to realize that this would be the perfect vehicle for Mr Pants, cast as a stand-in for my kids.
Doggy aunts and uncles have appeared out of the woodwork. Friends and family members keep telling us how happy they are that we finally have a dog. They sound almost relieved. Most can't believe it took us so long. How could we live on a big ranch and not have a dog - and if not a dog, at least a pet of some kind? What, exactly, had been wrong with us? Unbeknownst to us (but common knowledge to everyone else, apparently) something big had been missing from our lives. Suddenly, Kel and I, by the simple virtue of having Ike, somehow became more human.

Last night, I ended up meeting Randi from Not Just MOM downtown for Chicago's Fashion's Night Out. It's not nearly as big here as in NYC, but it was still a lot of fun. We hung around The Shops at North Bridge, where there were plenty of happenings. Of course all the stores were open later, and some had deals, but there were also goodie bags, free cocktails and snacks at every turn, giveaways and a mall full of fashionable ladies.
Furthermore, we also demonstrated that expanded MSCs can survive and migrate after transplantation in the lumbar spinal cord of SOD1-G93A mice, where they prevent astrogliosis and microglial activation and delay the ALS-related decrease in the number of motor neurons, resulting in an amelioration of motor performance (Vercelli A et al., 2008 ). Therefore we concluded that MSCs represent a good source of stem cells for future ALS cell based clinical trials.

First up was Don Bosco Institute or Technical College or something. It was an impressive building complete with a big gate that was open. There were a group of boys about 16 - 18 years old playing football and I asked one of them where the main office was. The office’s there but the headmaster’s standing there by the field, you can go talk to him, he said. The headmaster was a young fellow of about 30 maybe, standing with, I assumed, another teacher. All the boys gathered up around us as I approached him to see what the strange cyclist wanted. I felt a pang of nostalgia at his stern, go have your bath boys, and I thought of how cool it would be to stay here. But it was not to be. Today’s Thursday, he said, and Father’s at the church. He won’t be back for another half an hour and I don’t have the authority to let you stay, maybe you can wait and talk to him. Maybe I could’ve stayed and convinced the Father, but it was getting late and I didn’t want to take any chances, so I decided to try my luck elsewhere. Soon as I told the headmaster that he relaxed and started asking me questions about my trip, but I had to cut him short and move on.
I love color! Colorful would be a great word to describe my personality, my bedroom, my makeup bag and my closet! I usually like wearing bright colored nailpolish on my toes! Two of the walls in my room are a creamy yellow, which remind me of sunny days. Plus, my aunt just sent me a lovely
The BNP currently restricts its membership to “indigenous Caucasians”, which it defines broadly as Celts and Anglo-Saxons.

"It's a shame we haven't got two beardy blokes in the back," her mother said, "we'd be our own little Abba tribute band!" The girl couldn't sing for laughing as her mother was purposefully failing to hit the notes. The singing reached quite a volume as the car pulled up at a red light, passersby either tutted or smiled depending on what sort of day they'd had. They pulled away again as the light turned green. The girl sensed the kid's presence one second before she saw him. He'd walked out without looking, fortunately her mother managed to brake sharply.

Given that I had no agave or any other type of syrup around I thought I would make a sauce with greek yoghurt.

This was all up just a really good weekend breakfast. My morning was so relaxed that it may have even been afternoon by the time I made it.

I've never heard of them or seen them anywhere, and I'm quite proud of coming up with these ideas.

The Salafi doctrine held by the al Qaeda killer Muhammad Merah who murdered four Jews, including three children, in Toulouse Monday, is rife in the south Lebanese Palestinian Ain Hilwa refugee camp.

My friend Paul dropped in for a quick visit from Portland, so we had to enjoy one of his favorite places for brunch on Sunday last. And that was Comforts in San Anselmo. Paul was generally dismayed at the lack of Sunday crowds everywhere we went in Marin, however Comforts was bustling. We didn't have to wait for a seat luckily.
One afternoon, as I was preparing lunch, I sat Lil on the kitchen floor with a pot and it’s metal lid. She’d previously shown interest in banging together metal pots, so I thought she might enjoy exploring my cookware. To my surprise, she didn’t bang the metal, but instead quickly discovered that she could view her own reflection in the metal lid, and spent the better part of 20 minutes leaning over the lid and giggling/shrieking, then sitting up, then leaning back over the lid and giggling/shrieking, and so on. It was the most fun I’ve ever had preparing lunch!

You get all kinds of good advice. Train the toddler to sit still - because that sounds so nice. That would get me good mommy marks for sure and how cool would it be, at any time, to be able to say, "Sit still", and actually have your 2 year old sit still. Seeing as how I have yet to train my 12 year old how to sit still, I did not think I would be able to accomplish that.
It appears to be my nature to not stay very long in one place. I am not actually a nomad, or a itinerant (a more recent term) and I am not frantically looking for the greener grass.

Government coverup by not telling people the facts because to do so the 'aware ones' would draw their own conclusions which differ from the 'official' line.

Well, that's it - the Bitch is unlikely to have a book published in hardback now, that dream she first conceived in the libraries of all those small towns she lived in as a child, which was all she could conceive, because that's all the libraries had then - stacks of hardbacks and nothing else.

Meanwhile, Nemo’s captor-P. Sherman, a dentist – drops him into a fish tank in his office on Sydney Harbour. There, Nemo meets a group of aquarium fish called the “Tank Gang”, led by a crafty and ambitious moorish idol named Gill. The “Tank Gang” includes Bloat, a puffer fish, Bubbles, a Yellow Tang, Peach, a starfish, Gurgle, a Royal gramma, Jacques, a pacific cleaner shrimp and Deb, a Blacktailed Humbug. The fish are frightened to learn that the dentist plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla, who is overly-enthusiastic and infamous for killing a goldfish, named Chuckles, who was given to her previously, by constantly shaking his bag. In order to avoid the situation, Gill gives Nemo a role in an escape plan, which involves jamming the tank’s filter and forcing the dentist to remove the fish from the tank to clean it manually. The fish would be placed in plastic bags, at which point they would roll out the window and into the harbor. After a friendly pelican named Nigel visits with news of Marlin’s adventure, Nemo succeeds in jamming the filter, but the plan backfires when the dentist installs a new high-tech filter.

After leaving the acropolis, I did a bit more site seeing. I went to the Olympic Stadium, that held the first modern Olympic Games, where I saw a spectacular view of the acropolis perfectly illuminated by the sun. I saw the remaining columns of the Temple of the Olympian Zeus, some of the older buildings and then I went down into the flea market and antique area which was filled with a bunch of tourist/souvenier vendors when you were in the Plaka, but if you went down towards the less touristy area there were a lot of really cool shops. I met a really sweet man named Nic who owned one of the shops I went to. He left his daughter in chage while walked me to the nearest bank and while he walked me there he pointed out great places to eat, where to watch out for pick-pockets and taught me some conversational Greek. He was very sweet and gave me his card and told me to call if I had any problems. In fact, everyone I met in Athens was insanely polite!

One of the unfortunate traditions of Western classical music is old-fashioned sexism. It wasn't very long ago that the only women allowed to play in orchestras were harpists, so there is a lot of catching up to do, particularly when it comes to female conductors and composers getting a chance. The 43-year-old Finnish conductor Susanna Mälkki (above) started as a cellist and transitioned to conducting at the beginning of this century, specializing in contemporary music including such operas as Ades's Powder Her Face and Kaija Saariaho's La Passion de Simone. In fact, she was the first woman to ever conduct at La Scala only last year. (Click here for an interesting interview with Mälkki by local writer Cedric Westphal.)

How can God encourage us if we feed upon that produced by the world through the various forms of media? If there is a steady diet of T.V., movies, DVDs, Video games, periodicals, yes, and even the daily newspaper, how is God going to have His input into our lives? The sailors had no means of encouragement. This is true with every unbeliever, for the world offers nothing of lasting value. The ultimate goal of such a person is seen in Hebrews 9:27. “And it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.” They may not have known the verse but there is this implanted truth in every unbelieving mind for all, by nature, are afraid of death.
