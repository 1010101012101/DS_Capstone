Lydia's Organics: A new location has opened here in Chickenland, which means I'll have somewhere to go to cleanse after I've indulged in the shiro tan tan men deluxe.

I think over my options, (there is only one, they kill kids) and I walk to the door, and yell loud enough for the thugs outside and my family inside to hear, "It's the FBI , don't be scared, just be quiet and sit down!" I open the door and am looking at Michael Anderson's wife. They have her in front of them, between us, and she is crying.
ScrapFit's Workout 57 is to pick a word that best describes how you want to embrace the new year. I chose the word firework for Katy Perry's "Firework" song and the message of the song. This new year I want to be unstoppable and accomplish everything I want instead of holding myself back and keeping myself from accomplishing those things.
The creative process is all consuming. My partner's cell phone went off yesterday, and I found myself mesmerized by the sparkling sounds. I paused for a moment. Uh oh. I am in really deep! So I went for a walk in the local ravine to refresh my ears from the intensely focused sonic work. The outside world was also just a world of sound to me.
The old Cherokee simply replied, “The one you feed.”
I lightly spread Frosted Lace Stickles over the image, inked the edges and popped up the image with 3D Foam Squares. To finish, I added a few pearls.
When the Top Of The Pops re-runs began last spring, a lot of people saw them as evidence that 1976 was pop's worst ever year. This could only be said by people who hadn't lived through the cheap thrills of the Glam era only to be left high and dry by the tame, tawdry charts of 1975. To put 1976 in context, let me explain the desperation of pop music a year earlier. Only twice in my life have I left the charts alone - for a few months in 1987 when I was an indie puritan, and in early 1975 when I simply lost interest. I bought and devoured Shoot! and football took up all my headspace. Only for a few months, but for pop to have fallen off the radar of the ten-year old me so completely that I didn't know who was number one, still shocks the adult me.
The beer was Pliny The Younger, and 2010 was the last year is was available to take away from the pub. The vile secondary market in this beer (and others) prompted RRBC to make the beer brewery-only, which didn't stop some idiots from trying to smuggle it out to sell on eBay.

1) Brusset Cairanne and Hauts de Montmirail, nestled up to the slopes of the Ventoux, produce some of the best wines in the region. (Great olive oil can also be found in the district.) They have a place in Cairanne as well as in Gigondas. Go to Gigondas for the views and local flavor. There are some other great wineries there too, like Domaine de Pallieres and Raspail-Ay.
A great way to use up any ripe bananas and a GREAT snack for the kids to take to school, have with breakfast, or eat as an after-school snack. This is also a terrific bread to serve to guest or just enjoy with a hot cup of tea.
They called it “Earth Hour” and it was done to remind people to conserve energy.
It's important to understand that the supposedly "prudent" economies of France, Germany, South Korea and Canada are just as heavily indebted as the U.S. or "drowning in debt" nations such as Italy. In the long view, is Germany's load of 284% of GDP really that different from Italy's 313%? Yes, the mix of debt is different, but the point is that all of Europe, and indeed the developed world, is overloaded with debt: state, bank and private.
CRYING FOR NO REASON, FEELING EMOTIONALLY VULNERABLE: When blockages from this lifetime, and other lifetimes began to release the emotional body will react in this manner. The Photon Belt energy stimulates and contributes to the spontaneous release of these burdens. Trying to control or resists these urges further represses and blocks the energy making things more difficult. Crying, moaning, sobbing or toning becomes a cleansing release. Use a Bach flower remedy, or an essential oil to help with the emotional body.
I recently had an interesting conversation with a gentleman regarding his family. During the conversation he mentioned that his son has been attending college for about 5 years. I asked about his major thinking maybe he was studying for a Master’s degree or more. The gentleman seemed a little upset and stated, “He hasn’t settled on one yet.” At this point the gentleman said that he was worried his son may become a perpetual student and never graduate.
Third, is the teaching on modesty in Scripture immoral? No, and those who so identify it as such probably do not have a very good standard themselves. Morality has, at its core, the idea and teaching of the very essence of that which is good – God. Thus, the answer to the question is no, and neither is modesty immoral.

I sort of remember being a kid, and I don't remember hating vegetables. I don't remember any of my friends, who were also kids, hating vegetables. I don't know of any kids now that hate vegetables. And as much as I'm sure your "Well, my kids HATE vegetables" story is hilarious and fascinating, please keep it to yourself, because I care about your kids less than a kid-shaped puddle of dog urine. By a very, very large margin.

Teacher Jane Elliot conducted a two day experiment. On day one she told her students “This is a fact. Blue eyed people are better than brown eyed people.” Moments later a girl took longer than the others to get her book prepared. One student immediately said “She’s a brown eye” and the other blue-eyed students all chorused in agreement. The next day she changed the groups, telling the class that brown-eyed students were superior. According to Elliot, “I watched what had been marvelous, wonderful, cooperative, thoughtful children turn into nasty, vicious, discriminating little third graders in the space of fifteen minutes”
To those folks I have the following: Geologic time, by that definition is then incompatible with the Bible. If a day = a day, then in 168 hrs the world was created. Science would not have ANY merit, because EVERYTHING we know and understand about this world from a scientific standpoint, negates any possibility that the world was created in 168 hrs. There would not be any need to try and view Science and Religion as anything BUT mutually exclusive -- Science would be a complete lie.

I'm in a bit of a quandary though. I've been searching Flickr for images of the North East and I'm now tempted to do something I would've thought was unthinkable from the moment I acquired my first digital camera: dig out my trusty Pentax K1000 with SMC 35-75 zoom lens and put some good, old-fashioned film in it. Inspiration requires control over aperture and shutter speed and that's just what my Pentax offers. Can't wait to get the film back from Jessops or wherever I take it, although there will be a CD of the images as well. I think I'm going back indeed.

Phoebs, too, has been making the transition from little to big in the last few weeks (even though she will tell you until she's blue in the face that she's already a bigger bigger bigger BIGGER girl!) All of a sudden her hair has grown noticeably longer (still not actually "long", but long for our girl!), and she has transitioned to the 'Kinder 1' room. You have never seen a more excited child than Phoebalicious on Monday when she realised she was in the "big kids kinder". According to her teachers, she was so happy all day - and all I know is that she was simply buzzing last night with stories and paintings she'd done and new friends she'd made (not that she could remember their names, of course!) Withing the blink of an eye, Phoebe has become a big sister who knows how to play gently with Maisie; a daughter who loves to have her hair put up and wear princess fairy costumes, just like a big girl.

The music today is a background sky driving my thoughts far and farther still...all my favorite tunes driving away the worries and irritations - that slow tide, as it were, pushing me to remember what has been...I've forgotten so much that the music reminds me of. I've still much to get done while he works a 12 hr shift but the heat keeps me inside and the memories bid me - play that movie, remember those days. Listen, listen, and those ghosts will walk again in those hallowed halls of the mind. The song plays and unwinds the story and I remember it all again.
The compassion she has for hurting people is clear throughout the book. Still she brings up concepts that aren’t pleasant to embrace, but she works from a biblically solid base for what she says, and she bathes it all in God’s fierce love and compassion. I definitely recommend this book to one and all.
Since several of you asked food related questions, I figured we are all struggling to figure out something new to cook for supper. The chicken recipes below are not new recipes, they are tried and true, standards at my house. They call for inexpensive ingredients and are simple to make recipes (my favorite!)

The beach seemed virtually deserted, something which I, in my curmudgeonly way, prefer. The weather may have been part of the reason, because there was a stiff, cold breeze blowing, and another part may have been the relative lack of the usual seaside entertainments.
From the age of six until the age of sixteen, children enter the period of compulsory education (by law children must go to school). Initially, from the age of six until the age of eleven, children attend the five years of primary school also called elementary.

After the genocide, 70% of the population of Rwanda was female and many laws that discriminated against women had to be changed. Laws were passed to address the discrimination against women and jobs previously the preserve of men became open to women. Women also began to take a role in the judicial system and this had very profound effects. Very important changes have been made in laws governing sexual violence, marital rape, labour, property, inheritance and education.

They don't have to be autistic, but I tend to get along better with people who aren't exactly NT. A sense of humor is key. More key is embracing who I am, good stuff, not as good stuff, weird stuff. It helps to be nerdy, because nerds are awesome. An ability to speak Kassianeish (which is what happens when I am tired, or overwhelmed: what words there are may or may not all be there, they probably aren't in the right order, frustration occurs) is also helpful. Not freaking out in event of a seizure is an absolute must ... but so is being able to make just about everything into something to giggle uncontrollably about.
An interesting fact about MLF is that it only serves women. Why? Because they are the poorest of the poor, and the ones with the least amount of access to financing resources in developing countries (in some of the countries where Micro Loans works, women have no resources to go to the market, and are completely dependent on men).

The beautiful part of Thembi’s dark story is her very emphatic message that God has always been with her, especially when she was afraid at night. She calls herself a “blessed girl” and she is currently working hard to finish her Senior year of high school. Her family continues to live in poverty, but Thembi possesses a calm joyfulness that comes in knowing that God has plans for her and more than that, He is with her each step of the journey.
Placenta previa will often correct itself during pregnancy. In more than 90 percent of women diagnosed with placenta previa in the second trimester, the placenta will correct itself by the end of the pregnancy. The placenta itself doesn’t actually move, but as the uterus stretches it is not as close to the cervix as it was earlier in pregnancy. Think of it this way, imagine taking a balloon and drawing a circle on it at the lower end of the balloon. Then blow up your balloon. The circle doesn’t actually move, but it may not still be at the lower end once it has completed stretching. So for the majority of women, placenta previa will correct itself.
So, I cleaned out my closet to allow for a updated pieces of Spring. Apparently, Ann Taylor has decided that neon colors are in. I purchased an electric blue dress and a neon yellow cardigan. As I tried it on - my mind flashed back to my cousin's 16th birthday party (I was 13) and was SO proud of my new Esprit outfit. This outfit consisted of - yellow pants, and royal blue shirt with yellow/ red paisleys, and a red sweater. I was SPECIAL. Words can't even describe it. Sadly, no pictures exist (because 10 years ago I destroyed all potential blackmail material.) And yet - I still bought the dress and cardigan.

The note is “evidence” of the debt, not the debt itself. If the investor lender loaned money to the homeowner borrower and neither one of them signed a single document acknowledging that transaction, there is still an obligation. The money from the investor lender is still a loan and even without documentation it is a loan that must be repaid. That bit of legal conclusion comes from common law.
Only AFTER the issue of the future of the strategic gap is decided should ANY planning application be agreed. This is such a fundamental point; a point that we feel many councillors have still to grasp. Obviously we would fight against any changes to the current strategic gap / open space policy.
Back to the guy I saw for a month..... sure, it's going to be weird not talking to him 24/7, and not having that person who can always be there for you, but I think I've finally come to a level where I just need to give up.

My bus arrived, and I finally made it to another sort of Lovefest, but one that was a bit more real, and frankly, more loving. An anniversary party for friend from work, and his partner, who got married in 2004 when Gavin (er, should I say Mayor Newsome) had the city-county clerk issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
Western politicians such as yourself, Mr Cameron, have operated in a liberal democracy for so long you have forgotten the law of the jungle and are thus culturally unable to descend to its level. Islam, with its refusal to accept democratic man-made laws; its openly discriminatory attitude toward non-Muslims, its propensity for intolerant violence and its tribal/political/religious ideology is the law of the jungle, and the Savile Row suited and politically correct Western politicians — all reared on a diet of non-discrimination and tolerance — are thus rendered defenceless before it.

Today she told me that she was at the hair salon right by my house. I've been there before, but always left with a bad haircut (who razor cuts curly hair?!) so I don't go there anymore. She got her haircut by "L", who I'm pretty sure is about to discover that her husband is gay. But that's just my opinion, after having had dinner with both of them at a mutual friends' house a couple of months ago. Just sayin'.
Thanks for bringing the issue of why we need to work with the black ops people.

A quick tip... paint the undersides of the candles first. I painted them right sides up first, then turned them over to make sure I got all the nooks and crannies that would show from various angles. When I turned them back over, the tops of the sticks stuck to the drop cloth a bit, marring the finish. In my case, it didn't really matter as they weren't going to be seen close up, so they didn't need to be perfect. But, if you're doing this for your house, trust me and do the undersides first. :)
It was a huge surprise to discover Nadeshiko was actually a guy, whose family requires he lives as a girl while learning traditional Japanese dance. I was quite bowled over by that. More bowled over than discovering that Ikuto and Utau are siblings.

One of the other concepts of operating a unilateral surveillance team in a foreign country is the notion of third-party intelligence services trying to figure out what you’re doing. Such as the Indian Intelligence Bureau, the Russian SVR, as well as the very aggressive intelligence capabilities of and organizations such as al Qaeda getting wind of what your team could be doing. The personnel operating in this surveillance team are on a very dangerous mission. In essence, if caught they are committing crimes against Pakistan and they are on their own. They’re operating - the term is black - in country so the U.S. would not acknowledge any activities on the part of our government if the surveillance team had been picked up before the bin Laden operation went down.
Is there any way I could vote for this not to happen at all?
The very first recorded set of lyrics actually came from the first studio session. The very earliest live version that we even know of is from June 16, 1979, when they played at The Odeon in Canterbury. Unfortunately, that concert was not recorded (as far as I know). The song was actually as early as June 1979. Funny, given how much later the 'Closer' version was. Very fitting, considering their differences.

In all honesty, I would say anywhere. I could live in a library or a bookstore and never feel deprived of the outside world. My mother placed a book before me when I was nothing more than an infant, and I have been fascinated by books every since. I read cereal boxes, road signs, recipes, newspapers, etc. Anything is fair game. When I read for pleasure at home, I read either in my favorite chair or sitting on the bench under the weeping willow in my back yard or snuggled under the covers in bed late at night.

I’ve been drawing floor plans for fun since I was 8 or 9 years old when I had aspirations of becoming an architect when I grew up.

Then along came Pocket Informant. It’s been around for other platforms for a while, but the iPhone app is quite recent. PI includes a very full-featured task manager, and a full calendar system. And it syncs tasks with Toodledo’s servers (like ToDo and ToodleDo) and calendar events with Google Calendar. And I can access GCal from any browser, so syncing my laptop would be unnecessary. PI gives me a wide variety of layouts, including a very useful Today view of what I have to do just today. It supports both GTD and Franklin-Covey prioritizing systems. It also has an integrated search capacity that looks through my calendar, my tasks, and my contacts too. Another really cool feature is that it looks for the first reasonable task from each project that has been started but that isn’t complete, and creates a list of all next actions, which are then displayed on the Today view. Of course, you can reorder tasks in any project, so the right item comes up as the next action. Brilliant!

We can’t easily imagine these words printed as a vision statement on Wall Street or in the hallowed halls of Washington D.C. or in some Hollywood executive’s office – can we?

Hepinstall’s prose is quietly hypnotic as she tells the story from the points of view of Iris, Ambrose, Cowell, and Wendell, Cowell’s son. Each character has a distinctive voice as he or she battles inner demons. Hepinstall uses lots of flashbacks, both for effect and to keep the plot suspenseful. She knows just when to pull back so we anticipate what happens next.

Essaouira is a cute beach town on the Atlantic coast. Its name in Berber means “the wall” which refers to the fortress walls that enclose the main part of the city. Deidre and I enjoyed wondering around the streets inside the fortress where there are tons of artisans and crafts for sale. Wood-carving is big there with many vendors and it turns out I love all things wood! Who knew? I wanted to buy everything from wooden lamps, boxes, and bowls to candle holders and domino sets. I will have to go back before I leave to buy more as well as some beautiful paintings I saw.

Beyond that, one must challenge Bauckham’s idea that a ‘testament’ was “transparent fiction”. If the genre dates back to Moses, did any Jews think that Moses’ own farewell speech was pseudepigraphal or “transparent fiction”? The early church either wasn’t confident of the authorship or 2 Peter or assigned the letter to Peter. Apparently nobody in the first 17 centuries recognized the obvious ‘transparent fiction’ of 2 Peter.[88] Instead, Peter calls 2 Peter “a letter” (3:1) and there is not sufficient reason to overthrow this classification.[89]
I met and bumped into a lot of people that had to re-introduce themselves and re-bump into me the next day.
A few days later, I thought of a poem by Christina Rossetti. It has been quite some time since I last read the poem (at least a year, I think), so it was not the source of the dream. I offer it, not as an explanation of the dream, but as a sort of counterpoint, or echo. (And, besides, the poem is far more interesting than the dream.)

The president’s policy is mistaken, because space exploration is inexorably democratizing. Boeing is building a promising spacecraft. Bigelow Aerospace is developing a private space station and plans to train astronauts from countries without any formal space programs. Virgin Galactic is working on suborbital space flights for the paying public and, led by the British entrepreneur Richard Branson, is trying to marry entertainment values with space commerce. And Orbital Sciences Corp. has methodically mastered launch technology, sending 129 satellites into orbit over the past 20 years.
How he sees me, if he ever thinks of me, I dare not wonder. Hannah, whom I loved but failed, would have no doubt at all.

Once in the city we took a ‘Duck tour’ around Boston (in an amphibious WW2 style vehicle). As we only had one day we wanted to see as much of the city as possible and we chose to take one of these tours where they take you on land and water because we thought it might be something different/memorable/fun. We had a great guide (lots of sights and stories - historical, educational... all the boxes ticked) plus Mark and h both got to drive the vehicle on the Charles river too so all round it was excellent (expensive but well worth it).

Bypasses kill cities in two ways. They can simply remove any reason to slow down or stop at all, so that every customer just goes flying by, and all the commerce goes to another city. Or they can move the crossroads away from the old downtown to a new place on the outskirts, which becomes the new downtown (if you can call it that).

1. The Story Of The Blues
Just like every day, i started my day with two glasses of water on an empty stomach then had my cup of coffee (1 tsp of Nescafe, 3 tsp of fat free coffee mate, 2 tsp of sugar) followed by 30g of Bran flakes with a glass of vanilla flavored soy milk (Alpro) ! This combination is a true delicacy and is most importantly fulfilling!
The fact is (you ain't never been to a ball!) scratch that--Anne of Green Gable quotations sometimes happen to me--anyways, the fact is, ever since I gave birth to Angus my hair has not been the same. At first I blamed it on hormones and breastfeeding, but it has been over a year and I haven't nursed him for two or three months now. And still.

What was clear about Bill’s struggle, just from the way he said it, was that it was both a joy and a duty. It was his definition of his own life, his way of laying claim to it, and every day he both invited you and challenged you to join in. It was offered like an invitation to a celebration. It was issued like a challenge to live up to your own highest aspirations. Years later I realized that there was more than mischief and joy in that toothy grin of Bill’s, there was wisdom, and at least a shimmer of enlightenment.
Now if I’d had a few exciting or weird jobs it would be so much easier to write a pithy and amusing little biography- like the ones I read in other writer’s books! They all seem to have done such interesting things
The best bit: he has a name, which is rare for Cambodian dogs. His name in English means "little little". The family who owns this shop knows when they see me coming, they go into their house which is at the back of the store and they bring out the puppy. Can't beat service like that!
“Undoubtedly the effort that has done most to impress the deepest things of the Spirit of God upon the Christian Endeavor movement is the so-called ‘Quiet Hour.’ . . . . Because there may be some who read these pages who may not understand the inner meaning of the Quiet Hour, or what the old writers understand by ‘practising the presence of God,’ the writer. . . tries to tell his young friends just how the Quiet Hour may be spent. ‘Our Bible is open, perhaps to the familiar passage which reveals the wondrous truth that man dwells in God, and God in man, as John records it. Seek to realize this stupendous fact, for all Scripture is a lie if it is not a fact. Say to yourself over and over again: ‘God is here. God is here. God is within me. I am His child. God is my Father’.” (Clark, Christian Endeavor, supra, pp. 525-526).
From a “gifted storyteller” who delivers “always enjoyable, often hysterical stories” (New York Times Book Review) comes a meditation on the American Dream and its discontents. In his most ambitious collection yet, Steve Almond offers a comic and forlorn portrait of these United States: our lust for fame, our racial tensions, the toll of perpetual war, and the pursuit of romantic happiness.

People who have not experienced a grievous loss often think that grief is a choice. Sometimes, especially when young children are involved, the remaining parent can put off grief to focus on the childrens’ needs, but still, grief will surface at the anniversary. Later in life, this grief will surface again, perhaps when the last child leaves home, or when a beloved pet dies. I know a woman who went from taking care of a dying husband to taking care of her aged mother. She didn’t grieve after the death of her husband because of this new focus, but the death of her mother about destroyed her. For most of us, though, grief cannot be denied. We embrace it or it embraces us, and we reap the whirlwind.

I'd like to say I went home after this, but...I stopped at the Grey Lodge for just one more (honest, Ernest & Scott were just pouring 3 oz. samples!). It's still pleasant to stop in there, and I do it often on my way home from Philly events to wind down.

In searching for Lightning players in this set I’ve noticed that most of the prospects for the team are already skating in Norfolk (Ashton, Tyler Johnson, Dustin Tokarski), overseas (Nikita Kucherov, Nikita Nesterov) or are in college (Alex Killorn, James Mullin).

When the ocean water temperature is high in west Indian Ocean relative to the east, it is said to be a positive IOD phase, and vice versa.A positive IOD is seen as boosting the prospects of a concurrent Indian monsoon and hence the RIGC outlook for good rains, despite the ‘weak’ IOD credentials.

Hi, I hope you're enjoying your weekend and hopefully having some crafting time.

In my book Basilisk I made up my own myth of the basilisk.The story is set in an imaginary city called Lunnzia and the citizens worship a god called Arche who is both creator and destroyer of the universe. In her guise as a creator she appears as a beautiful dragon, and as destroyer she is a basilisk. Lunnzia is at war and a couple of crazed inventors build a machine, ‘the Basilisk Contrivance’ to harness the power of nightmares. My poor heroine, Donna who used to dream of dragons, is forced to dream of the basilisk and when she is hooked up to the ‘contrivance’ her dream is amplified and projected into the minds of everyone in Lunnzia and they experience her dream basilisk as if it were real.

As superintendent, I must keep my focus on students, and I appreciate all of the teachers and other staff who are working to do the same. The idea of tension during contract negotiations is expected; the idea that our teachers do not trust my intentions saddens me. I cannot be successful without you, because our children cannot be successful without you.
We discussed if we would test our last two embryos and decided against it. There is a chance that by testing them they could be damaged. We discussed how we would feel if we tested them and found out one was viable only to learn it had been damaged during the test. We know that would be devastating and something we would always wonder "what if" about. That's not something we want to set ourselves up for. Part of the decision not to test is the fact that we have little faith in our clinic when it comes to not damaging them. These are our last two and only embryos. We don't want to risk losing them due to a clinic error.
There is a ridiculously long sequence in which Loveless captures all three, separates Escobar from the with the promise of creating a device to rape her, and placing super powered magnetic callars around Jim and Gordon’s necks which attracts flying saw blades. The two defy all laws of physics and good humor in extricating themselves from their predicament. Additional scenes were filmed to be placed here, which is why the sequence runs way too long, because test audiences could not decide if the movie was a comedy. The additional scenes do not add any additional laughs.
Sunday's first Texas Barbecue Festival turned out to be a victim of its own success. Owing to good promotion and beautiful weather, the normally-docile Farmer's Market was jam-packed. Meanwhile, the surrounding streets were crawling with gas-sucking land yachts clumsiliy trying to navigate their way around pedestrians.
I hope you have enjoyed my meandering journey down a nature path. The next time you go, remember to bring water, wear sturdy shoes and never, ever tell your kids to walk. There will be plenty of time to walk when they’re 40.
And… ploughing along the rails of replica cycling team-jerseys one stood out from the rest. It was off-white with the maker’s (team) logo discreetly positioned over the left breast in a silvery-white. From a distance, it looked like a simple off-white cycling jersey. Close up, the cleverness of the design became apparent.
Spread the nuts in one layer (you may need 2 pans).Roast the nuts for 12-18 minutes, stirring twice with a large spatula, until nuts are glazed and golden brown. Sprinkle on about 1/2-1 t. of sea salt or kosher salt after 6 minutes – toss well. Do a second sprinkling of salt after 12 minutes – it really adds to the flavor. At this point,check if nuts are brown enough to your liking if if they need more time. Given, my oven, 18 minutes seems to do the trick (plus I like that number; it’s got a good vibe).

There is anger that so many babies died because of inadequate hospital care. Anger at government corruption and the elevation of “cadres” with criminal backgrounds into positions of power. Anger that the ANC is sweeping through our major cities obliterating everyone else’s history but their own. The list goes on.
The book is also slyly about gender and sexuality. Much is about hidden identities. In a subplot, Coby is a girl masquerading as a boy named Hendricks in a troupe preparing for the presentation of a major play held in a competition in honour of the ambassador’s visit. Coby has to not only keep her identity a secret, for to be discovered invites death. She meets Mal in order to train in fighting so that she can fend off the attentions of other males and females in the company, though she harbours a secret love for him. Mal himself has secrets: he once was a member of the Hunters, a secret clan who kill skraylings as part of an initiation ceremony. He has relationships with women but more secretly with his best friend, Ned. Ned himself is forced to betray Mal to people looking for him, which leads to others knowing about Mal’s twin brother, who is insane and secretly kept locked away in a hospital.

An unofficial designation “Courtyard of the Ancients” was nominated by me personally, as I could find no other for this fascinating locale. It is an open fairly flat patch of desert, perhaps 2 to 3 acres in size, surrounded by stately walls of sandstone. Once inside it is hard not to sense that this was a unique and meaningful place for the native peoples that inhabited this area in the distant past.

For me, there is nothing like hand washing dishes. It is a homemaker's task that hasn't changed in many a long year. What I do is what my grandma did, and her grandma before her. It's so simple and gentle on the dishes, it's relaxing, quiet and satisfying. Just me and a sink of hot water with either liquid soap or dish detergent, a dishcloth, dish mop, stainless steel scourer and brushes, and a sink of warm water for rinsing. I don't dry, I set the plates and cups on the drainer and let them air dry. Hanno wanders along later and puts everything neatly back in its place.
Not so long ago I was invited to spend a day in a secondary school since one of my stories, 'Compass and Torch', is included in the AQA GCSE exam syllabus. This is a psychological story about a relationship: it features a moment on a camping trip taken by a father and young son estranged by divorce, and deals with the emotional tensions between them, and at the end suggests a prognosis for their future relationship. It's chiefly a story of repressed emotion, symbolised by the watching wild ponies ignored by a father and son intent on the practicalities and the tensions between them. The story ends thus, as the father and son bed down for the night:

It has been noted in several inquests or legally comparable hearings abroad, that police officers can be placed in a very difficult position by someone intent on achieving their own death. This occurs by inducing officers to use lethal force, ‘having’ to shoot the individual because they are deliberately creating an impression or a reality whereby others are at grave risk. It attempts to force the officers to do the least worst thing and kill the suicidal person to maintain broader public safety and of course, during investigation subsequent to all police shootings including incidents like this, links are often made to victims’ mental health histories which compounds the emotional complexity of the action taken seen in hindsight.

The book jumps around quickly so you really need to read closely to stay with the story. The book was written by a twelve-year-old and published when she was thirteen so I was expecting to move fast compared to a similar book written by an adult. The fact that the book was written by a twelve-year-old was what initially drew me to read the novel. My curiosity of what a twelve-year-old would write about had to be quenched. I’m glad I read it, considering her age, she did a remarkable job on her first novel and I can’t wait to read the second one. It’s wonderful to see a young person committing to a task as hard as writing a novel. Most adult writers I know can’t finish a first novel where as JM Lee has finished two and is currently working on a third.
And yet, when Stevens was an MEP, he received a set payment, currently worth around £40,000 per year, to run a constituency office. As MEP for the old Euro constituency of Thames Valley, when he first was elected in 1989, he listed in the 'grey list' - the European Parliament's official list of MEP contact details, an office at 70, High Street, Sunninghill, Ascot. However, by the official list published on the 18th February 1991, that address had disappeared, and his official contact addresses were listed as 40 Smith Square, London SW1, and 15 St James's Place, London SW1.

There is a great balance between what Andy figures out on his own, and what needs to be explained to him. Andy, for example, sees his Vietnamese relatives (and other Vietnamese) as greedy and rude, demanding and expecting money from his "rich Australian" father. Andy knows his father is a gardener, that both of his parents fret over bills. Yes, they have a house, a car, Andy and his sister Mai go to school -- but they aren't rich! How did his father afford this trip, all the presents? And then Andy discovers that for years, his father has been sending money back home to his family. Even though the family owns a successful restaurant!
Today, I got to see The Hunger Games. I went with some of my family and we had a little mix-up of theaters. We ended up getting there after the previews started and the only spots left were in the front row. It was definitely an interesting perspective! I was a little nervous about seeing the movie after reading the book (I always like the book better...ahem Twilight...) but the movie was really well done. I was impressed!

Upon recognizing this physical sensation, I took a deep breath, TRUSTED and opened up “Pages” on my sexy little macbook pro and make a freakin’ flyer. And guess what.. if you ask me, it freakin’ rocks.

A few minutes later, I got up to go get Lillian some coffee which she had been hinting for an hour for her granddaughter to do. I walked out into the hallway and the Sad One followed me. I waited for her to catch up thinking maybe she was going for coffee too. We stood there looking at each other. "Do you pray?" she asked. I told her that I did. "Will you pray for my husband"? I was thinking, "Oh Lord, why is she asking me, the one who sometimes doesn't feel like my prayers are being answered because I'm not always Your good and faithful servant? Why didn't she ask Lillian or Margaret?"
Rome is a very romantic city, if you are not in love when you go there you will go back in love with the city at least. I, myself, was completely enchanted by the city, the attitude the citizen had, the language, the food, the gelato… you name it. In my opinion, you haven’t tried real pizza until you have been in Italy. You are a pizza-virgin until then! I would probably say the same about the ice-cream as well, but Pizza-virgin sounds more fun than ice-cream-virgin or gelato-vergine… I will stop making up words now!
Since she got home, Frank and I have learned some new vocabulary. An "emo" is a goth-like person who is full of emotion. "Nu Ma Nu Ma" is a bouncy song, in Romanian, that is evidently all the rage. And "skeet" is a bad word. (Hint: MJ cracked up when, during a conversation yesterday about Grandma and Papa's upcoming hunting trip, Frank made a passing comment about "shooting skeet." When Frank said it, it meant firing a shotgun at a clay pigeon. The teen meaning is a good bit more sexually explicit than that.)

There are a lot of people who find poetry to be obscure and inaccessible, and to those people I say “Go read Emily Dickinson.” Dickinson’s concrete, relatable poems have a music to them that has been compared to church hymns—they’re easy to sing along with. Check out her poem “I’m nobody! Who are you?” if you’re looking for comforting words from a good friend. “Hope is the thing with feathers”, another incredibly popular Dickinson poem, will lift you up on your worst days.
I'm not sure what was better about the situation, that she didn't say anything other than my name, her feelings about me, and then eating the bracelet (with conversation taking place after these more important things), or that she struggled to get a piece of the bracelet into her mouth, so it looked as though she was gnawing at my wrist.
When we had our first child and we dropped to one income it was a huge shock to the system. And then you always get 2 huge bills due around the same time and there goes all your pay. I decided to open a ING online account. I put some money in there from our baby bonus to be at least a month ahead. I went through all our bills for the year and entered into a spreadsheet. I had amounts for yearly, monthly and fortnightly. So for example car rego is $640 per year, fornightly cost is $24.62. So every fortnight a certain amount gets transferred to ING and this will cover all bills. When I get a bill now I don't worry where the money is coming from to pay for it. I hate having bills on the fridge so I have a clipboard where I put my unpaid bills. I put all the due dates in microsoft outlook with a reminder its as easy as that.
Please have at it in the comments or by emailing me. I'll be happy to update this post highlighting those comments if enough people make them and there's interest in me doing so. This just seems like an appropriate instance for some actual card collecting discussion!
From a purely pragmatic perspective, this hateful little turd is not something any sane person wants clogging up their constitution. Gay marriage is illegal enough as it is. However, in several decades when gay marriage bans are as anathema to decent society as colored water fountains, Texas is going to lose Super Bowls, conventions and businesses because of it. Smart people will refuse to relocate here and conscientious tourists will steer around Texas on principle.
I decided instead of throwing all the broken plates out that I would make a mosaic with the pieces. I searched for all of Michael's to find the perfect piece to do it on. I finally came home with a square wood mirror. If it all works our the way I want it to we will have a beautiful mirror that will match our china and therefore be hung in a future dining room and perfectly match! What a bright idea huh?
This is a 5-star review
Dr. David Starkey was correct when he said about last years riots that “whites were adopting black culture”, for, despite the valiant efforts of the media to report only on the white perpetrators, the fact is that black people involved in the rioting were over represented in terms of their numbers within society by over 2,000% , South Asians were over represented by 75% yet whites were under represented by 61% (it didn't look like that on the TV news did it?). Political correctness may dictate that we call the urban uprisings of 2010 “the English Riots” but it was not native English culture which we saw on display.

so...I basically didn't post a blog for the whole year of 2010. Not sure what my problem was. Mainly laziness I guess. Feel like no one really cares what I have to say..do they?! Or maybe I just put all my info on FB so why bother to do it here ya know? I do enjoy reading other peoples blogs. Just not a fan of doing it myself.

Sadly one of the major sponsors was Meat and Livestock Australia with meat masterclass events which is disappointing on so many levels including health, environmental, corporation supporting independent bloggers etc and is really not inclusive for vegetarian bloggers. Thankfully Jill from confessions of a food nazi decided to organise an alternative event for those in Melbourne which she named eat.drink.picnic for those who couldn't attend the Sydney event with more of a focus on vegetables.
My first instinct is to get overwhelmed and walk away because the house will never be ***perfect***. You know what? That's true! In this life nothing is perfect.

Paratus yelled with triumph as he studied something that had been projected onto the wall. His joy was suddenly tempered with fury as he turned on Se’rith in a very aggressive manner and tone. He was rambling inconclusively about something the College had in its possession, something of great power that was running interference. Se’rith was beginning to think that Paratus must have lost his mind, being cooped up inside the ruin for so long. Yet she reconsidered when she saw what was being projected on the wall. A map of the whole of Tamriel, it seemed to have been stencilled in starlight! High Hrothgar was clearly highlighted and saw was the isle in Cyrodiil that housed the Imperial City. Two bright dots dominated Skyrim, one where the College is located and the other one near the city of Whiterun. Se’rith looked at Paratus for an explanation.
1. A Zoo Animal Probability Graph. To do this, we had a bag with one of each zoo animal in it, and the helper of the day reached into the bag and pulled one out without looking. Then we colored in a square for each animal that we pulled out. We just did one animal per day, and worked on it over time. But if you do not have time to commit to doing a whole calendar book, this would be a fun activity to do whole group, and just let the children take turns pulling out an animal until one of the columns is filled.

You really made me feel humbled when I rememebr am 19 years old, and I will always remember you even though you will be as far not to be reached. I promise to reach out to you with prayers since where my arms can not reach to give you a handshake, prayers can always reach. And as well, since prayers are the only true giftest you can always give to friends far away from you.

After you notice Casey's eyes, you tend to notice the curvy shape of her body; her large, soft, pale breasts - always a sliver away from showing too much and her wide hips and plump thighs - she is all undulating softness. Except her lips. Her lips are thin and pale from pressing too tightly against one another. When she parts them in a smile, a rare thing, they disappear completely, obscured by two rows of tiny teeth fighting for show in her small, tight mouth.
Fast forward three months, and here I am making a birthday gift for my baby sister, and just feeling incredibly blessed at the privilege of being able to do so. I used a lot of purple and silver because they are her favorite colors, and on the front I added a Scripture verse that we both love. Small, simple details that I didn't know 3 months ago, but that will make her happy on her birthday this year. Like I said, this is one extra special candle. :-)
The performance is a lot of fun and the actors do it very much over the top. Mrs. Hardcastle (Sophie Thompson) is wonderful as the lady who tries to seem more cultivated and fashionable than she is and Tony Lumpkin (David Fynn) is a hilarious “clown”. But, my favourite is actually Hastings (John Heffernan), the friend of the leading man Marlow. He is supposed to be the dopey but lovable sidekick but he makes the character so likeable and sweet that he actually outshines the leading man (Marlow/Harry Hadden-Paton).

Celine, the editor, had mailed me a copy, but it was taking a while. So I decided to drive downtown Hamilton to visit a friend, Dave, who owns Mixed Media, a great little art supply, stationery, and creative book shop on James St. North in Hamilton. He had a fresh stack of the magazines out and I nervously took a first glance. I was quite impressed.
See how easy it is to make something ordinary into something potentially horrific? This character giggled so you probably aren't expecting her to go crazy. But what if I change just that one thing...and you know that scene was me...and it's all true...OK I was wearing a black tee shirt but creative licence is allowed...but that will tell you...that I do indeed have issues.

We finally got in to see the doctor, and he said that it was our fault that Jake was having problems. (Said in a round about way).

From our experience and from the literature of our profession, it is apparent that hospitals, colleges and universities throughout North America have become more aware of the realities of the carparking problem through the past decade. They have realized that without definitive policies, carparking demands can swell into enormous appetites for greensward conversion, capital and operating funds, and administration and policing attention....
This dessert can be pulled out with only 4 ingredients, so thought of sending it to the event JUST "4" FUN of Good Food. All the best for hosting this event....

One of Lenin's rhetorical attacks upon social democrat and trade union leaders and officials was to dismiss them sneeringly as "labour lieutenants of capital" (seeking a role as subordinate partners in managing the exploitation of our class). That cannot be said of the General Council's invitation to David Cameron!
Now suddenly the turning tide,
Leigh will be talking you though the food and beer, I'll be selling you the beer if you should wish to buy some more, and I've been told that Zak will be around for a chin wag for a bit too. It's going to be a relaxed and enjoyable evening, and a great way to introduce new people to the joys of great beer and food. I've been told the theme for the night will be sweet treats (cakes, muffins etc..) and some darker stuff; nice Porters, Stouts, maybe some Dunkel Weisse and general desert beers.
He cuts a slightly disheveled swath through the Capitol at all hours, his calling often cited by colleagues as his chief accomplishment after a decade of service here. “Tim had his finger on the pulse of his district,” Speaker John A. Boehner said in an e-mail, “and always reminded members that at the heart of every democracy are representatives who will listen first, learn, and then lead.”I’ve never understood what’s so extraordinary about this phone habit. According to the Times, Johnson calls 4,000 constituents a year. (His district has a population of 700,000.) Skip Thanksgiving and Christmas and the calls average eleven a day. Count only working days (251 in 2012), and the average jumps to sixteen, still not that many calls to make. Johnson has never called me, though he has sent long and thoughtful responses to several letters and e-mails. The one occasion on which I heard him respond to constituents, a 2009 “town-hall meeting” on health care, was deeply dispiriting. I wanted to hang up.
Of course we need tell children that girls should have as much sex and as many partners as men, that is good. Progress will be when our young ladies are having more sex and more partners and make more money too!
Sandra Bullock was the most popular comparison in the early 2000’s, but I hadn’t gotten that in a while. Maybe she thought I was Jennifer Love Hewitt. (Anyone who has ever seen my chest knows that isn’t even a remote possibility.) Still, I was convinced that I had to look like someone famous.
Sorry for not having a GREAT picture as most of my favorite blogs do but, we were hungry!

There was much derision about the fact that the characters drop out of supposedly soul-destroying yuppie jobs only to get 'McJobs', working in shops and bars, which are hardly more fulfilling! Even Clare defended the characters on this, saying that the point is that they are no longer defined by their unfulfilling jobs, but that didn't wash with the detractors: surely, the answer came, they are just messing about, knowing that they can depend on their middle-class parents, so they are hardly rebelling against their parents' generation. And they go home for Christmas!! Only middle-class people can afford to drop out, it was cried. Ann, had, like me, liked the prose and especially the 'footnotes', but did now agree with the detractors that the characters' situations were something of a middle-class indulgence. In fact, there is a 'footnote' which comments on this, self-ironically in my opinion, but I didn't recall it during the discussion: 'SAFETY NET-ISM: The belief that there will always be a financial and emotional safety net to buffer life's hurts. Usually parents.' There was more derision about the fact that the characters choose to do their dropping-out in California. I should have quoted a passage from near the beginning which I think carries conscious irony about the compromise involved. Noting the lordly luxuries of the rich retired inhabitants of the area, narrator Andy says,
I'm suddenly very glad that I DON'T currently have television programming at my home.
Jillian offered a shaky smile, but all she really wanted to do was curl into a ball and cry. She ached all over, she was tired and she wanted to go home. She said as much out loud.
They live out a religion… and not a relationship with an ever present God.
The Gospel enters our lives in through a vast variety of circumstances. Some are brought up into it as children, and never know any other way of life, some encounter it in the midst of thoughts of suicide, depression, desperation, extreme loss, some come to intellectual crossroads where they need a better theory to inform their lives’ choices. But in every case the Gospel retains this characteristic unique to living things—it reproduces by multiplication, and though there may be a million personalities through which God’s wonders are expressed, God himself remains the one constant source. A true-breeding strain of seed produces the same plant every time it is planted. In the garden, we “prove” seeds and soils by planting them out and seeing how they reproduce other seeds. We are all being “proven” as soils bearing seeds. Do we multiply? Are we true-breeding? Are we fertile ground to raise more seed? We need to recognize that the proving ground of life in the Gospel is not whether the seeds of the Gospel in us produce a healthy plant (that is, our own healthy spiritual life) but whether we multiply the seed to scatter all around us. God’s plan for the world was always that we would multiply, and that the earth would be completely transformed by His people. We are central to that plan, and our success or failure to multiply is the center of God’s work in us. That multiplication begins with sharing what has been poured into us: the message of Jesus.
Not only one of the best films of 1990, it’s one of Schwarzenegger’s finest cinematic accomplishments. Under Paul Verhoeven’s great direction, Total Recall is a fast-paced rush of violence, gore, and humour that never slacks. The funniest scene not intended would be when Schwarzenegger’s character gets caught out in the Martian atmosphere and his head starts expanding, it’s very funny but is supposed to be really serous. My favourite scene of all would be when Quaid uses the holograms to trick the guards and kill them is very fun to watch showing off Schwarzenegger’s ability to pull one liners out of nowhere and make them gold. Now there is going to be a remake of this coming out this year but I don’t think it’s going to be that good, mainly because they have replaced Schwarzenegger with Colin Farrell and they will not be going to mars! That’s the main plot point.
The quilt top is nearly complete (I just need to add the white border). The main print used is Michael Miller's Giraffe Garden in grey. I saw this fabric months ago & just couldn't make up mind it if was a print I truly loved. Plus, I wasn't sure if I wanted to make a neutral quilt for the baby now or wait until we find out gender at birth & then make a quilt. I finally decided to buy the fabric only to realize it was no longer available at Fabricworm... or most other online shops. Luckily I was able to find just enough of it on Etsy to make this quilt! And despite the colors being a little out of my comfort zone (which actually look better in real life than they do in these photos), I really love how this quilt is turning out!

I just have to console myself that I will never have to take them again. Also, if you do really well on them you can get scholarships to state schools. Not that that is applicable to me, since I don't intend on staying in Massachusetts. Not even remotely close.

And, finally, the cherry on the top. We just happened to be around on the ONE DAY in the entire year that the Jemez Pueblo, one of the more conservative Native American communities, dance in celebration of a bountiful harvest. The public is invited to visit their pueblo, among brick-red sandstone mesas in the Cañon del San Diego, to watch this day-long event — but no cell phones, photographs or even clapping are allowed as it is an authentic religious ceremony.

In addition, meltdowns aren't wholly caused by the current scenario but are usually the result of an overwhelming number of other issues. The one which "causes" the meltdown is the "straw that breaks the camels back". Unless you're a mind reader, you won't necessarily know what the other factors are and your aspie child may not be able to fully communicate the problem.
Anyway, I hope everyone has a happy thanksgiving and hope it is filled with fine food, fine beers and fine people.

But the film would have been just another conventional action thriller had it not been for the core dilemma faced by the hero. Walker doesn’t realize it, but he has to make a choice: Sondra or Michelle. Initially, we think Michelle has no interest in him, but we are wrong: when Walker ventures off to recover his wife at last, Michelle is disappointed that he doesn’t take her with him. “I don’t want your money, Walker,” she says. Of course she doesn’t. She wants to help him. She wants him to find his wife and return to his life of happiness—even if it means sacrificing her own. Polanski allegedly disliked the film’s ending, in which Michelle dies trying to fend off the Arab terrorists who have Sondra in their custody, but I think it has held up well today. Consider how Walker’s attitude towards his situation suddenly changes at the last minute. Even after he has recovered Sondra, he’s still worried about Michelle; he ignores Sondra’s plea to remain at her side, and runs off in a futile attempt to rescue Michelle from the terrorists. It’s like he’s attempting to take both women home with him, and not just one.

Want something good to watch with that fabulous dinner? Well, this is just a trial, but I would like to start "Movie Mondays". My husband and I are total movie fans, and we tend to watch a few each week. I thought you might like to hear what we're watching, and maybe even give me some suggestions as to what to watch next! Movies are fun, and hopefully my "Movie Mondays" blurb will be fun too!This was obviously our Halloween selection. Here goes!
God commanded Moses to make a sanctuary, a sacred space, a mishkan, the Tabernacle, a holy place where God would dwell in the midst of his people. Clearly, God didn’t want to be a distant deity.

Kimba, from the Atlanta unschooling contingent, at the not-back-to-school party on Monday. We went to the state park out here, Hard Labor Creek, and had the lake and beach pretty much to ourselves! It was so good to see Kimba, Beth, Missy, April and their kids again.

Anyway, the UK beer I was most thrilled to see win on the evening was Bracia from Thornbridge - I've never made any bones about the fact I think this is one of the most delicious beers I've ever drunk in my life and think it's a undoubtedly a silver medal winner, I didn't get to try the gold which is from an utterly unpronounceable brewery in Lithuania, so goodness knows how amazing that is!
Fortunately, Hunter and my other friends are fine. I'm hoping they didn't suffer much damage to their homes. Watching the footage was horrific and my heart goes out to everyone affected, obviously.

Javed Akhtar, Satish Bhatnagar and Salim Khan have done a great job adapting the ‘Prince and the Pauper’ storyline to suit a Bollywood audience and the dialogue is well written and very funny. Director Ramesh Sippy keeps everything moving along and despite knowing the switch is going to happen he still builds plenty of suspense into the story. This is a total Bollywood classic for me – great performances, good songs and excellent comedy, all delivered with such style by Hema Malini. I absolutely love this film and I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve watched it. A full 5 stars!
BOSTON (CBS) — Former NFL linebacker Junior Seau was found dead in his home in Oceanside, Calif., on Wednesday, according to TMZ.
Hello everyone! I know you have all been waiting for a new mulberry paper pattern. I'm very excited to finally start getting back on track here. We've had so much going on the past few weeks that it's been overwhelming... although the journey has been exciting.
Just one thing. I noticed in the newspaper the other day that you had a 3 billion dollar contract for media that you did not give to an American company. Funny that there is not an American company you could use. I always thought we had a pretty good advertising industry here in the USA.

Cook onion slowly in the butter until yellow. Add water, potatoes, spinach and salt. Cook slowly until potatoes are tender. Add milk, a dash of pepper and cayenne and heat thoroughly before serving. The recipe makes 6 servings.
The synopsis, where we find out that Sookie walks in on Eric feeding on another girl, has haunted my dreams. And not because I think that it is something that Eric couldn’t do, but I’m anxious to see Sookie’s reaction.

So I opened the letter, prepared to be irritated, and read savagely through to the third paragraph of introductions and reminding us how we were connected to each other (apparently we had met at an event many months ago and I had been very "charming") before I realized there was no manuscript pitch. Only the author pitch. Although there was no mention that the man was an author, only an invitation to dinner or a concert. Oh. I was being asked out.

He knew who the voices belonged to. And despite not being able to make out any words within their garbled otherworldly voices, he knew what they wanted from him. In fact, he had been awaiting their request for a few days now. He’d first heard their whispers three weeks ago and had known that the time would come when they would speak clearly to him, to give him instructions.

My second project for UStamp with Dawn and Friends I Love the Holidays is one of my favorites! It's a real toss-up for me as to which is my favorite holiday...Christmas or Halloween. I love Christmas because our families come together and spend quality time together. Halloween is so much fun because of all the cute costumes! My favorites are the little bitty kiddos.
The ENTIRE NATION went to war over the rights of others. It was our bloodiest war ever. To say it was a mere small manner (a mistake of a few founding members) would be eliminating reality entirely, to make such a claim. The Civil war was by no mean civil. We had to fight for their rights. You, being from the south, may disagree with that. But it was a battle to the death that YOU Matt, and your kind (families from the south), was wrong and the rights of others was restored. Lincoln went against his entire core beliefs, of limited government, to Federally FORCE the south's hand to free slaves.
Is the Church then unable to dialogue with institutions or individuals who hold certain beliefs contrary to our Faith? Not at all. From the beginning we prayed for the very same emperors and authorities who persecuted and killed us. We appealled to them, to their reason, for tolerance and for the truth (the sole truth that comes from God which they can still perceive by the use of their reason, and not necessarily faith) which enables genuine justice and peace in society.

On the upside: "By training drivers to shift strategically and avoid hard acceleration or hard braking, they have shown that fleet operators of 100 vehicles can save $31,500 annually in fuel costs. Larger fleets, in the 1200-vehicle range, could save $1.2 million per year."
Anyway. While thinking about this, I wondered, did Eve really spin? How far back in the history of humanity, as opposed to religious stories, does spinning really go? I remembered reading about this research, which uses the genetics of human body lice and head lice to infer that the practice of wearing clothes goes back at least 83,000 years and perhaps 170,000. If these clothes were made of skins, spinning was not necessary; but if they were made of cloth, the thread must, I suppose, have been spun.

So I called the doctor’s office, which, of course, was closed on Wednesdays. I left a message. I called again Thursday. They didn’t pick up. I left another message. Just when I thought that they might be avoiding me, the doctor’s office called. The woman in charge of billing talked to me. You know, sometimes it’s nice to talk to someone who knows what’s really going on and actually cares about you. She assured me that I had no financial obligations in this case. That the hospital blew it by not filing the paperwork and that she had been on them since the Friday afternoon when my surgery happened. (I’m guessing that the billing people were too eager to start their weekend.) She assured me that she’d deal with the insurance company—she explained how they work, which is not too different than what you see in The Incredibles. Finally, she assured me that she would take care of everything. I could almost hear her cracking her knuckles. And she even promised to call me when she had everything “taken care of.”

For fiscal year 2012, The Act caps security spending at $684 billion, and non-security at $359 billion. For fiscal year 2013 these numbers are, respectively, $686 billion and $361 billion. At first glance, one might think that these spending caps are weighted in favor of defense spending, and against domestic spending. That’s what I thought at first, but digging into the budget numbers tells a different story. The ‘security category’ is cut by a percentage amount greater than 2 to 1 compared to the ‘non-security category” .

The goals you have in life, the major ones that is, are hard to grasp sometimes. They seem so far away, like we come so far only to go even further and it always seem just out of reach. Today, you need to stop looking at where the goal is, but where you are and be proud of how far you come. For example, my business, four years ago it was looking on the verge of death and we were pretty scared here. One by one new clients came in and every month we got better, then every year we became more stable, till finally this year we got too much work and needed to grow. We are still not where we want to be, but I will take where we are and proud of what we did to make it.
“Aha” “The Sun Always Shines On TV”
As we see in the Laws on the natzir (see above), a nazir would not drink wine among other things, but Jesus drank wine with his disciples. But despite Isaiah’s use of the term, nothing indicates that the Messiah would be called netzer. An alternate suggestion connects Matthew’s usage with the word natsar, “guard” or “keeper.”
That’s why tango is so powerful; the same song can inspire you to dance in different ways based on how you’re feeling and whom you’re dancing with at that given moment. An individual song doesn’t have to feel the same all the time, just as the same model or the same pose doesn’t have to be drawn the same way. A posing model with a twinkle in her eye may inspire a completely different drawing than if she had a pensive look, even though she is the same person and has the same eyes in either pose. The same is also true of tango songs. If you listen to a different level of music than you did last time you danced the same song, then your dance should be different.
I've neglected the Weekly Weeder for some time but am thrilled to be posting a terrific interview this week with Lucinda Blumenfeld an agent in her own right, who also happens to be a dynamo outside publicist and marketing pro. I've worked with her on three campaigns thus far and have been really impressed. I thought talking to her about the real skinny on publicity would be helpful to readers.
Yes! We were constantly followed throughout the exhibit and gift shop! But we had met our goal and I was somewhat satisfied...with the largest collection of O'Keefe paintings, I expected floors of art work...this exhibit, while incredible, was not exactly what I had expected. It was an exhibit of Georgia O'Keefe and Ansel Adams...I love them both and the display of each of their work was well worth the trip...but somehow I had it in my mind that I would see more of a collective display of her work...like the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam (one of my favorites). I am in no way complaining here...I just craved MORE!
These last two stories are hurt by the lack of in-between details because we haven’t know these characters long enough to really feel like we want an end-of-the-line story. We want more investigating, not angels screwing and killing immortals in an orgy of sex and blood and a main character who doesn’t know who she is anymore.

There was a clearing up ahead. From the darkness of the forest the unfettered light cast it in a faint palette making it difficult to see but as his horse drew nearer Lord Fuckington could make out more detail. Wild grass reaching upwards to the sun. As he reached the point where the shadow of trees gave way he steadied his horse. 200 yards yonder he saw what he had been searching for, that which and drawn him on. A solitary piebald doe, intricately marbled in colour between white and brown, stood feeding on the grass. He thought of the fun he would have torturing this fine animal, slicing and cutting, dismembering – The noises it would make! The fine meal that could be had! Then again, that would entail returning home with its body, and he hadn’t brought any servants with him to carry it.

On the way back home I had the displeasure of hearing my sister's half of a conversation between herself and her boyfriend. He was, apparently, very upset with her choice of clothing for this concert, as he saw via a cell phone photo she snapped of herself and then sent to him. In his opinion, she should not have dressed the way she did without him there. Because she had dressed as she did without him there he was suspicious that her intentions were to pursue other guys.

Shattered, confused.
My son or my GB (gorgeous boy) as I refer to him has just turned twenty-one. When our children reach major milestones reflecting and reminiscing is what we mothers do. I thought about my GB as a baby, as a toddler, as a little chap heading off to school, as a teenager and as the young man he is today. I realised that he is the same GB today as he was twenty one years ago. He hasn't changed and neither has the bond between mother and son. He was born with an independent spirit and has always been that way. Most children crawl before they can walk, not this GB, he stood up at the age of nine months and wandered off, he still wanders his own way. The relationship between mother and son is a protective one. We mothers protect our boys when they are young and I think our sons become protective towards us as they grow older. We worry about their first days at kindergarten, hope that they will they manage their schoolwork and pray that they survive any bullying that might come their way at high school. With girls it seems different. My DD's (darling daughters) couldn't wait to start school, could sit still long enough to finish their homework and never had to face the perils of being sent to boarding school.
Now more questions have arisen.
But I get nothin’.
I swat her away. “Not me. Never, if you make me do that I will hate you for it. You realize that this being so important to you, it makes it seem like you have given up on me.”
Just look at the name of the organization: the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. They are in place to control our access to booze*, to control the price of it, to control where and when we can buy it, to control who makes all the money off the sale of it, to control what kinds of booze we're allowed to have**. The state's Liquor Code even controls our choice to buy booze out of state; although the liquor stores right across the border may be closer, may have better prices, better selections, better service, better stores, we are not allowed to buy booze there and bring it home. If we do, the State will -- if they can -- arrest us, fine us, seize the booze and destroy it.
BROOKLYN FASHION WEEK IS FOCUSED on SOLUTIONS and change... for a sector many have ignored!
The problems are with implementation.
The same night another patient's chest tubes were draining a copious amount of clotting blood. The nurse had to manipulate the tubes frequently to ensure the blood passed into the collection chamber instead of clogging the tubes. It's rather mindless work and takes away from other aspects of patient care, but it's still necessary to perform. I suggested that a trained monkey with dextrous hands would really free her up, "Dressed up in little scrubs just squeezing and twisting away."

There's been a lot going on in the brewery (kitchen) the last few weeks.
And on a related note, good vermouth tastes good. Alone, without the rest of a cocktail, as it’s consumed in Europe. Dolin’s Blanc, which makes excellent martinis, is on the Lillet end of sweetness and tastes fantastic chilled. Carpano Antica, a favorite vermouth for Manhattans, has a delicious bittersweet vanilla flavor on its own.

Barack Obama left the U.S. for a few years early in his life. He was born in the U.S.A. — in our 50th state! — and he attended school in the U.S. for eight years — longer than Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson and George Washington combined. He was raised by his two Kansas-born grandparents — as American as L. Frank Baum’s Dorothy, who was raised in similar circumstances (other than her trip to Oz).
I have given birth twice in my life and I will come clean and admit that I am not one of nature’s ‘birth lovers’. My first baby was born in a birth centre and my second was born in a mainstream hospital. Both babies were vaginal births, the first a ‘no intervention style birth’ (but a long, painful, posterior labour) and the second birth an epidural birth. They were pretty successful births, all things considered – my babies were alive and well and I recovered quite quickly, but in both cases I had a lot of fear to overcome and I did not quite make it in my quest to put that fear aside. However, to this day I remain awestruck by the process of birth and my own incredible encounters with that.
Howdy howdy everyone! it was another busy week Casa Diva.
When the British cancelled their invasion of Burma, calling off the operation, Wingate complained to all who would listen. The US Air Forces in India agreed to give air cover and air support to the Chindits if they went ahead with their mission. A sympathetic RAF Colonel managed to obtain enough air transport in the form of Dakota troop transports and gliders for more accurate supply drops.
Well, folks - I finally took the plunge. I joined Pinterest last night, and I'm ashamed to admit how much time I've spent on it since. It's just as fun as I had imagined (which is why I'd resisted joining), although it will be a while before my boards are filled and fleshed out.

The CPF-volunteers running the Victim Empowerment Centre (VEC) at the Springs Police Station accused the station-commander of not replacing the VEC-centre’s police-cordinator after she went on maternity leave. Thus trauma-victims’ dockets were not being opened and the rape-and violence cases against them not investigated.
All we value will soon be gone thus we must love it while we’re still here.
I noticed the expression on his face right away, I mean, how could you miss it really? It was the look of someone who was dredging through a river of pure, unfiltered SHIT. I sometimes wonder what he does after we're all gone.

I’ll try not to bore you, because I need you to keep reading. Here’s the short and sweet explanation of the psychology behind it all. There are two explanations for the stories I’ve told you, I will call them ‘group psychology’ and ‘fellow witness psychology’:
I think that’s a pretty sweet initiative and it’s worth supporting, plus it’s a brilliant “excuse” to approach and photograph strangers without feeling too awkard.
One of the horrors of addiction is that, as the addictive substance becomes less and less satisfying, and its negative effects mount over time, it becomes even more necessary to consume more of the substance to provide escape from the greater and greater suffering the substance is causing.

Benetton has a history of provocative ads that usually have nothing to do with the product, but everything to do with their philosophy of unity. Bing or Google Benetton and look how much press they’re getting. For a fashion brand, buzz is everything, and Benetton will never be vanilla. More like Amarena black cherry swirl.

That’s when I decided to pull my feet up off the floor. Well, I can tell you that I’m not very comfortable at the moment. I’ve had to change positions several times. From all of the times I’ve been bit—I’m keep thinking that another one is on me, so I have to take a look and then type a few more words. I think what is happening at this point–is that the places were I’ve been bit ‘smart’ every once in a while—creating the sensation that I’m being bit again, when really—it’s just the poison from the bite that I’m feeling.

I love his style of writing… and he is a rottweiler by the looks of his about page!! full of fun and definitely an interesting read… he says “Maybe one day this blog will serve a useful purpose of providing alternative commentary, exciting debate, and challenge existing and questionable norms on discussions regarding life,History, Intellectual Property, Politics, …. lets just say everything that your mind craves to comment on but which you sometimes can’t..” can’t wait for that day! In the mean time read his blog so you can say I new him before he became the well respected authority who is the go-to on History etc!! love this blog!
This matches perfectly with Titus 2:13 which says,
I'm a huge fan of the Costco mesclun mix, which includes several delicate varieties of lettuces, and also has a really nice color and texture variation. If you can't find that, one to two small heads of delicate lettuce varieties work well (butter and bibb lettuce are two really nice options).

Peredur looks and sounds and moves a lot like Gerard Butler, especially the Attila/Beowulf/300 version. Why? He’s got an exceptional warrior body type and the fighting skills to match, he’s got that crazy maniac energy running under the surface that personifies Peredur’s attachment to life, and he’s got the all-important lurking melancholy that Peredur needs.
I pray that all people who feel alienated by religion find a spiritual home full of love and acceptance. My God or higher power or whatever you’d like to call it does not hate trans people. I don’t believe hate has a place in spirituality. I pray you find comfort, acceptance, and love.
It is one thing to dislike a person's appearance, or even to call out an insult to demonstrate that dislike, but Romney attacked this young man, and encouraged others to assist him in the boy's humiliation.
I have absolutely no complaints about Daniel Woodrell as a writer. He is magnificent. Girding his story with chilly yet lyrical prose, he deftly compliments the gritty Ozark landscape in which his characters live, move, and have their being. His knack for vivid description is reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy:
This year, as a result of some fairly negative publicity and the refusal of the Queensland branch of the RSL to participate last year, Foster’s moved to distance the fundraising from the notion that a commercial business can have a heart and still make a dollar and made a direct lump-sum donation to the appeal. And here is where it gets a little murky.
I love almost everything else about this notebook, so let me give credit to Staples where it is due.
This morning she woke up bright and early and was just waiting. We always sing Happy Birthday to the bday kiddo right when they wake up. To be cruel, we didn't do anything. We just pretended like we had no idea what the day was. She was chomping at the bit, going nuts, waiting.

As an athlete, this speaks to me. I don’t walk into the gym, start putting weights on the bar, and attempt my max back squat before I’ve even taken off my sweatpants. Agonia = warm-up. Check.
Man. That's some obscure poetic shit that Rimbaud, William Burroughs, Baudelaire, Rumi and Kerouac would find obtuse.
I don't love television. That has more to do with the hypnotic qualities of that electronic glow, but when my children were small, they were only allowed to watch PBS (and no more than half an hour of TOTAL screen time). As a result, I was never besieged with pleas for sugary breakfast cereal or the latest toy. When they were finally allowed to watch commercial tv, they were rather annoyed by the commercials, and we discussed what was being sold. Did the fruit chews really make people's heads explode? Again, for media literacy, this book is quite good, and interesting enough for students used to the fast pace of television to read! I especially like the discussions of product placement, because I don't know that students know about this.

I have often asked the question, is government inherently stupid? Well, I don’t think government is inherently stupid, but it’s a debatable question, but what government is government doesn’t get the same signals that your local bank gets.
Ultimately this is a distraction. Republicans are getting bold enough to hit the Democrats and Democrats who have an unbalanced share in this whole crisis and who are getting enriched by it with campaign kickbacks need some outrage that takes the heat off of themselves. As has been shown in other posts the Democrats knew these bonuses were coming because they stripped out language in the Stimulus Bill to stop them and adden an amendment behind closed doors while locking Republicans out to specifically allow them for companies who took the stimulus funds.
I don’t imagine I ever swung as good, even at college.
In low-level WoW, progress is given by experience points. This singlehandedly solves the need for tangible rewards from a play session, no matter what activities you take part in. The problems with the low-level game will be discussed below. Once you reach the level cap, however, that all-encompassing incentive vanishes, and the designers are challenged with providing the player an incentive and reward structure to participate in various activities. The first major point is that gear is the only mode of actual improvement of your character. We’re going to put side cosmetic rewards and achievements for now, because they’re a side activity that each player values according to her own idiosyncrasies, but they don’t tie into the underlying RPG engine described above.

Jesus is not a respecter of persons. When He responded to the leper’s question, Jesus said, “I will”, but His words were not limited to the leper on that day. It is as if Jesus said, “I will” to all of us.

Claiming influences as varied as The Birthday Party, Motörhead, and Leonard Cohen, The Sisters Of Mercy came together in England as the '70s turned to the '80s. Through a troubled and sporadic recording career that spanned a decade yet only resulted in three proper albums, The Sisters Of Mercy created some starkly memorable, deeply moody music that often gets lumped in with the Goth scene but was much more than that. Yes, you can hear the echoes of Peter Murphy's horror-flick pretensions in Andrew Eldritch's rumbling growl, but there are equal parts Jim Morrison rock-n-roll preening and Nick Cave swagger mixed in as well. Their music verged at times on pseudo-psychedelia, rocked hard when they so chose, and could become the stuff of nightmares with surprising ease.
“Self, a dresser just like that is exactly what I’m looking for in the Bub’s room.”
The bible never said she wanted to go back, but she had to go to the owner of the deed. Her husband bought her back from the last bidder. Our husband (Christ) has bought us back from Satan. Maybe you can’t buy her roses or chocolate today, but you can pray that the hold of the enemy would be broken off her heart. Let your intercession, your prayer life between you and the Master call her back into your arms. For she is your lover, your wife and the wife your youth. From My Baraka, (My Gift) Michael K.
How could you not take this test seriously?

I think about the fact that the world is not black and white, that while we might want to make things simple so much of the world is what happens in the spaces between what might be considered right and wrong. It is about teasing out the nuances, the complexities, the messiness and understanding that each one of us holds onto a different piece of reality and that only by viewing them together do we get an idea of the ways in which power, privilege, oppression, and equality work.

CEREBELLUM – BALANCE & COORDINATION. Smallest part of your brain. The cerebellum is involved with balance and coordination of movement. It also plays a role in functions such as motor memory you need for physical skills. When there is trouble in the cerebellum, even simple tasks such as reaching for a glass of water can prove difficult.
The orgasm drilled into her with sweet vengeance, causing her legs to shake and her ass to tense up and clench as she pushed against the dual provocation of my finger and my tongue as they tantalized her most secret sensual places and coaxed her to accept the white hot anguish of orgasmic relief.

On to the disappointing news: A.J. Jacobs’ The Know-It-All wasn’t exactly worth the wait. Which is to say that, shockingly, a book documenting one man’s mission to read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica isn’t quite as riveting as you might think.
The point I'm getting at is NOT that the reader in question was wrong. I know this person wouldn't lie to me and I trust her judgement, but I think her tastes and mine probably overlap a lot less than I thought. There's no point my trying to write a book which does things differently to the books I'm really passionate about - how could I find enough passion to do a good job of it? - but that does mean that people who like different books, who are passionate about different things in writing, aren't going to be able to help me write a book I am passionate about as much as people who share my tastes are.

your community, so that the Gospel message of Jesus Christ can shine forth. Where there are women and men of good will ready to renew their efforts in this regard, I believe that stability, understanding, and healing can come. Where there are individuals who do not truly seek the good, and who even work actively against it, where there are those who work to incite hatred, there may need to be more formal warning and action. First, though, I exhort you, with the words of St. Paul to the Church in Ephesus:
When we got home from the mall and cleaned up, I suggested that we go camping. Since neither Lynnette nor I are the outdoorsy-types, camping means “sleeping in the living room.” We pulled out Madison’s tent and threw her tiny mattress inside. I dropped my pillow on the couch. Lynnette laid out on the fold-up mattress. Things were going pretty well – until we turned out the lights. Apparently, Abby was upset because all three of us were in the living room and she was sequestered to her cage. She kept barking. Madison was so tired that she fell asleep in the middle of it all.

We descend to Walbottle, passing a primary school built over the Vallum, then begin to climb once again, always gently, but the terrain is still key to the line of the Wall. We are now on a 3km straight stretch, the last part of which is lost in a huge interchange when finally we reach the A69. Past the school, in the field on the left, the hints of the Vallum are more substantial, but the curtain wall lurks beneath the road, still, and the ditch is lost to us.
b. Second they would be required to go back to common law instead of admiralty law under the gold fringe flags. Under common law if there is no damage or harm done then there is no violation of the law. This would eliminate millions of laws which are used to control the masses and protect corrupt politicians.

The theme this year was robots, and lots of lucky kids got themselves drawn as a droid by a fantastic artist. The rest of us, including Gar Shanley (right), writer of Supernatural Showcase and simultaneously the most miserable and the funniest man in Irish comics, and Tommie Kelly (far right), rock star, writer-artist and hellraiser, take our places upstairs in the main hall, show off our wares, sell them if we can, and do our fair share of sketching as well. The punters range from your usual thirty-something comic book con crowd, to young families, to teenagers, and I recognised plenty of faces from previous years in the crowd as well as behind tables.
In most cases it is not necessary to invest a ton of cash into replacing your flooring before listing a home. An exception would be cases in which the floor was exceedingly worn out, dated or dirty.

The financial cost of losing a partner from fee earning can be extremely high. In addition to the direct financial replacement costs, such as recruitment fees, the intangible costs at partner level should not be under-estimated. Core skills, knowledge and experience can be difficult to replace, and the extraction from a team of a key partner can threaten stability, morale and growth internally. Externally, key client relationships can also be put at risk. In addition, the loss of team or departmental management or leadership skills can create long-term problems.
First, we have begun a transition to Afghan responsibility for security. Already, nearly half the Afghan people live in places where Afghan Security Forces are moving into the lead. This month, at a NATO Summit in Chicago, our coalition will set a goal for Afghan forces to be in the lead for combat operations across the country next year. International troops will continue to train, advise and assist the Afghans, and fight alongside them when needed. But we will shift into a support role as Afghans step forward.

Photography, I realised, works a little differently for me. As you can see in the images below, I am drawn to buildings, architecture, nightlife, people, construction, city grime, etc, but my photos are unedited and perfect for your viewing displeasure. There’s just so much in every scene to the point that it’s not about how artistically precise a photo is, but how effective it inspires me so I can revisit an experience and relive how I felt walking through that particular street or gazing at that slice of perplexing sky. In other words, photography is a personal means, not an end, to emotion and is therefore an excellent assistant to poetry! I do however admire the excellent photographs that many of my hawk-eyed (ok this phrase has taken on too much significance with The Avengers) friends have taken, and blessed my eyes with!
I may be a terrible person, but I simply hate when people can’t figure things out for themselves.

Yes, our house stays neat and clean. Believe it or not, I used to actually be embarrassed about that because people would act like I was showing off; but the truth is that I enjoy life more when the house looks nice so I keep it that way. It's for me. It really hasn't been that difficult. The key is to clean up everything every day. The dishes get done after every meal. If I get where I am having trouble with dishes then I tweak the plans to include paper plates and foods that aren't as messy. I know that's not "green", but a girl can only do so much. We straighten the whole house each afternoon at 5:00. Each child puts away their things and then we have a quick, playful inspection (more on that at the end). At bedtime I check their rooms and make sure things are straight for the next day. We are so used to it that it's kind of easy now, but I remember when they were all little it was more work but I always felt it was worth it. Now that they pretty much do it on their own I can say that it was completely worth
I gave them a rundown of what our patient population was like and the role of the nurses on our unit, trying to make it sound exciting (it really is) and rewarding (emotionally and financially). When that failed to inspire any questions or even change in facial expression, we went through the various medical TV shows and ascertained which were reasonably accurate (ER, though with less death of staff) and which were ridiculous (Grey's Anatomy, Scrubs, House). That ate up five minutes. Thank goodness the Communities in Schools staff had good questions. I think I might have even convinced a staffer to consider nursing.

Both ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) head Jimmy Manyi have threatened retribution against Nedbank for Reuel Khoza's remarks — and to use taxpayers' money to do so.

Prof. Cloward explained that each welfare client in New York City is entitled under existing law to special benefits for clothing, blankets, etc. He said that in 1965 city special benefits welfare payments amounted to "about $40 per client" and he called for each welfare client to demand $100 to $1,000 in such benefits.
It doesn’t matter what is said as much as it is pivotal to answer why or how it was even heard.
But, you know what, it’s bloody hard work. Doing a full-time job, managing very intense work pressures, managing a large process, with so much involved in it where so many people are depending on you. Doing this while doing lots of voluntary work, which I absolutely love, but devoting so much time to the voluntary stuff, awareness raising, interacting, supporting, and so on. Doing both of these as well as managing my own mental health, managing my own life, trying to keep well. It’s pretty bloody tiring, and tonight I’m tired and fed up and moany. I’m doing my best but it’s simply not always good enough. And I need a lending hand along the way sometimes. It’s frustrating sometimes when the reward for doing well is to be given less support, but then again I used to moan about how dependant I felt on the profesionals, and it’s nice to not be like that anymore.
So, do you think your partner is the bees’ knees? Maybe so, but don’t expect everyone to think that way. Feel secure in the way you’re partner looks at you and if they don’t make you feel like the best in the world, then maybe they’re not worth it.
I find it interesting that much of the fame of a wine region like Bordeaux rests on its great, top end wines – Château Latour et al – with many of the other estates relying on a measure of reflected glory and reputation to help them sell the wines that most of us actually drink. It strikes me that in the New World, however, it is almost the reverse, with the reputation of many wineries being made by the more everyday wines and some of that prestige then being redirected to help the consumer trade up to their rarer and reserve bottlings.

This event used to be called the Osaka International Beer Summit, when it was held annually at the Sky Building in Umeda.

The eggs arrived Monday afternoon. We promptly carefully unwrapped them and gave them to Betty. Some people say to wait 24hrs and let them sit after shipping. I just can’t. She was so happy! She snuggled down with happy little clucks and spread out to cover all 12 of them (4 Blue Laced Red Wyandottes, 4 Easter Eggers with a 50/50 chance of Frizzle!, and 4 Blue/Black/Splash Large Fowl Cochins :D).

It is not healthy to feel guilty and I don't and it's not healthy to stay in a cycle of self pity and I am not, but it is not realistic to think some events won't cause pain or won't be difficult. I want my children to know its ok to cry and it's ok to have a bad day, and doing so doesn't make you unstable or unhealthy. Just the opposite, really. Cry, scream, yell, then move forward. Find positive ways to move forward. That is inconvenience. That is healing.
The Internet has been amazing for book talk. There is more of it, and at a higher quality, than perhaps at any other moment, certainly in my lifetime. Dinosaurs love to lament the lost space in newspaper book reviews; a few years ago, the National Book Critics Circle fought, what seemed to me, a self-serving campaign to save the book review, by which a handful of people really wanted to save their right to sell the same lame 450-word book report to a handful of regional dailies. You didn’t have to bother reading the book to write many of those reviews, and as a one-time daily books editor myself, who once assigned reviews to some of those active in this debate, it was clear that many critics did not. Now we have the Rumpus and the Awl and the Millions and the Morning News and Maud Newton and Bookslut and the Nervous Breakdown and Full-Stop and the Los Angeles Review of Books and HTMLgiant and you get the idea. Professional freelancers didn’t save the book review – the battle was won by the Internet and people who love reading. The culture is richer for it. Twitter’s a useful tool for keeping track of the idea explosion.

Side profile. Lodi’s Sicilian pie is considerably thinner than most other square pies sold in the NY/NJ metro area. Because it is cooked in a pan, the crust is more reminiscent of a focaccia than a traditional NY-style Sicilian pizza, but it is still excellent nonetheless. The sausage was wonderful and its juices really permeated the flavor of the sauce and cheese. A top quality pizza that I recommend heartily.

It is hoped to have the list in an spreadsheet format shortly, available here.

Apparently the Obama Administration has no quarrel with any of these goals. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was quick to give a formal national security waiver for Egypt to override legislation by Congress and deliver Egypt's $1.5 billion in military aid. Rest assured that some of those arms will find their way to Hamas, which has officially been declared a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department.
And we’ve been centered in this space that a malach is one who is a messenger, and perhaps you’re asked or you wonder where a soul goes after a presence in this world, and there’s an idea in Judaism that there’s a never-ending cycle, an ayin sof, a place or a time or a moment or a presence without end.
In the last year, however, the most disturbing trend has been Amanda’s propensity to say or do things to garner attention – any attention, even if it involves piggy-backing off of others. Whether it’s constantly reminding us of her relationship with renowned author Neil Gaiman, conveniently tweeting about love as Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor was leaving Twitter over his short engagement with his now-wife (of course noting that she’d been talking about it with him at a show right at the peak of the media and blogging frenzy), or bashing Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber right when both were trending topics, just to garner focus on her… Well, you do the math. I cannot count the number of cycles lately where:

Pour the batter evenly into the cake pans. Stagger the pans on the oven racks so that no layer is directly over another. Set two layers on one rack and the third on the other. Bake 25 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Monitor the cakes for doneness; each one may be done at a different time.
There are so many wonderful dishes being lost. With the global development, somehow what we used to do, eat or play got lost in transit. That is why I started playing this food heritage idea in my head.

Of course, those of us who have been doing Spiritual work, have been saying that for a while…it has been the constant message of many channels in recent years. But now, it is moving into the mainstream. Of course, it is not being reported in the Media to any extent, but those who can “join the dots” can see that this energy is spreading. It is the first stirrings of a powerful collective desire to throw off all forms of slavery and restriction, but especially the economic prison that holds so many.

By the end of 1991, the Soviet Union broke up, quietly and amicably. I watched in disbelief from afar as, for the second time in a single century, Russia went through a revolution; thankfully, this time peacefully.
At least last night was my last injection of blood thinners so I will no longer have to do that every night. I have a couple of bruises from those injections. It will also be nice to finally wash my leg that was operated on and have a somewhat normal shower. Even though I have to sit on a chair and use the shower hose and stick my leg outside the shower curtain as I can't bend that knee and it doesnt fit inside the shower space.

Who wouldn’t love James Spader? He’s the epitome of the movie bad guy. From Pretty In Pink to Mannequin, he’s best when he’s bad. But when he brought the character of Alan Shore to life on The Practice, I was enthralled. Then they made him the star of the spin-off.
After Jesus died, his friends showed their love for him by taking care of this body. Carefully they took it down from the cross. They wrapped it in clean, new cloth and put it in a tomb, which is a small cave or a room carved out of a rock in the hillside. After his friends laid Jesus body in the tomb, they rolled a large rock over the doorway.

“The Only Place” is essentially a love-song to California, with lead singer Bethany Cosentino telling us “this is the only place for me” and asking “why would you live anywhere else?” To be honest, if anyone asked me that in normal conversation I’d be quite affronted – well obviously I’d like to live in California, but we’re not all so lucky! (not that I’m jealous or anything.) But seeing as it’s in the context of such a good song, I’ll let them off.
My son is a bit of a handful, to say the least. And upon reflection, that really might be all boys/girls/children right on the cusp of 4.

It has been more than a decade since Christina Hoff Sommers published her War Against Boys. Although she makes some valid points, I think the conclusions drawn from her work -- and where we have gone since that time in regimenting an expectation of failure when it comes to boys and literacy -- are mistaken and harmful.

Breivik is standing trial in Norway in a shooting and bombing massacre in July that killed 77 people, including children. He confessed but rejects guilt by claiming he was trying to protect Norway and Europe by targeting political forces he says opened the country to immigration. He has said an anti-Muslim network he is part of will lead a revolt with the aim of deporting Muslims.

While my paint was being mixed, I found myself practically elbow-to-elbow with the frantic woman. She appeared even more frantic up close, and seemed heartlessly taunted by piles of brochures advertising "The Perfect Color Combinations for Your Home." She had that wild look in her eyes that someone gets when they've stared at paint chips all day. I peered down at her little brush-outs. They were about 2-inch by 2-inch samples, and I wondered what was the point? She appeared to be trying to select colors for her interior - one sample was a medium orange-y brown, the other a greyed-down minty-ish green. She had this teeny-tiny strip of fabric that she was trying to match the green sample to. Seriously - this piece of fabric was about the size of a french fry. There was no way she was going to be able to match a paint color to that! Not to mention the horrible fluorescent lighting overhead. It was a total disaster.

If you truly want to achieve permanent weight loss, focus on eating whole foods (like apples instead of apple juice), cut out refined grains and processed foods. As Jillian Michaels (who is my HFIT role model by the way!) is fond of saying “if it didn’t come out of the ground or didn’t have a mother don’t eat it!” Use this great saying as your food mantra.

By far the best experiences with other actors have been those in which there is a lot of trust. When you are both on the same page you can take risks and know deep down you can catch them if they suddenly leap at you and vice versa. Sometimes it just happens naturally, and quickly. Recently, I worked with actor Hayley Magnus on a fake commercial, as a skit for a television show. Within 30 minutes of meeting we were expected to have an awkward but passionate kissing scene. It was brilliant (not only because she happened to be very pretty) but also because we were both so in-sync that we could just riff off each other and really work on the humour of the scene.

Another striking element to the story is the music. The Billy Nayer Show really comes through here and adds something rich to a story that would have otherwise been a bit thin. Another interesting element is the fact that due to the low budget of the film, all space travel shots are actually just painted pictures mixed with the live action inside Sam’s spaceship (a sparsely decorated one-room apartment with fantastic wallpaper). This actually worked for us. It gave us that feel of very old Saturday morning serials and didn’t distract like intrusive CG does.

During enslavement, plantation owners forbid certain customs and traditions. Nevertheless, enslaved peoples found many ways to express what they could not say or do outright. Stories, music, and song and dance served as a way to pass on forbidden cultural practices. Coded messages were sung in spirituals and sewn on quilts. Others were disguised in the double-talk and wit of trickster tales, tall tales and riddles.

4. Have a strategy. Always buy the stored value card so you don’t have to fall in line everyday just to buy an MRT ticket. Always check until when the card will be useful or consumed. If the card lasts till Friday, buy a new stored value card night of Thursday. Never buy a ticket in a morning, especially when you have a 9 o’ clock time bomb. The most preferable time to buy would be when you’re on your way home and not in a hurry.

Dreiser takes pains to point out that Carrie is a little smarter than most of the people around her — a little more sensitive — but she is still a passive, reflective character. During the course of the novel, she rarely takes positive action. Instead, she accepts what she’s offered and manipulates it to her advantage. Early on, when she has lost her job at a shoe factory and is looking for work, she meets Drouet, who offers her clothing and an apartment.

The system is quite clever and makes good use of the land space. It works like this… Each family has a tomb. The tomb is concrete and marble and has two levels. On the top one, the recently deceased is placed in his/her casket. In the summertime the temperature outside reaches the 90’s or sometimes over 100 degrees; the inside of the tomb can reach about 200 degrees. This acts as a furnace and slowly cremates the person’s remains. After a year and a day the process is complete. When another member of the family passes away, they reopen the tomb, take out the coffin (that is either charred wood or rusted metal by this point), and toss the cremated remains into the compartment below. The ruined coffin is then thrown. The space is then free to add the recently departed and begin the process over again.
I checked several sources and the various definitions I found were all basically the same, which made me laugh. Because in general when I think of swagger, negativity does NOT come to mind. When I think of swagger I think of confidence. I think of athletes that have complete faith in their ability. Athletes that KNOW they are going to win; come out on top; dominate their opponents.

I was worried that having one drink would make me want another. I haven’t drunk any alcohol for a week - which is amazing when I think about it, but I am really starting to get used to the non-drinking me - so I thought perhaps having a drink will make me crave more.
The Diamond Jubilee celebrations for Queen Elizabeth are right around the corner, really – the main festivities will take place the first weekend of June – and it seems like new information is coming out left and right about jubilee events. There’s no better time, then, to take a look back at a few of the Golden Jubilee celebrations from 2002 for a taste of what’s on the way, or perhaps a comparison of what's not on the way as the case may sometimes be. (This, by the way, is not an all-inclusive account of events then or now.)
This classic breakfast dish, pronounced (chill a key lays), can be spotted all over Mexico and the U.S. I absolutely love it and usually eat it every morning that I'm in the Yucatan region. It can be served with either rojo (red) or verde (green) sauce and features fried tortilla strips simmered in the sauce and topped with eggs, beans or meat. I usually choose red sauce with chicken, shown above.
The relationship between Zeus and Perseus was not handled as well in new Clash either. In old Clash, Zeus looked over his son, and wanted him to succeed. Was it because Zeus is an egomaniac and his blood had to prevail? Perhaps, but it made some interesting (if underdeveloped) tension between the gods there. In new Clash, Perseus is far more a bastard child... offspring from Zeus fucking over a king that Zeus may or may not even remember. Zeus communicates with Perseus from time to time, but it's less of a game now and more of the gods dealing with their rebelling human problem.

When you're having terrifying and debilitating medical treatments, with an uncertain outcome and when your life is in the balance, you tend to think a lot of Big Thoughts. And one of the biggest was what I was going to do if the treatment was successful. I was aware all along that even if the cancer was defeated this time, there was always a chance that it would return. So when it was finally over, when I got the call in January, and the confirmation in March, that there was no more cancer, I was still acutely aware that the clock is ticking.

Emily Radley travels, against her will but guiltily, to a Connemara village on Ireland’s West coast to spend Christmas with her dying aunt. She hasn’t seen Susannah in a lifetime and she hates to leave her children and holiday celebrations in London but her husband persuades her it is the right thing to do. Susannah, who married for love against her family’s wishes and is now widowed, is very frail and troubled by some secret that seems to have the whole town in its grip. As a terrible storm bears down on the coast, the fear rises palpably and the weather explodes in a maelstrom of wind, rain, lightning and ferocious tides. Through a flash of lightning, Emily sees a ship foundering offshore and, as it sinks, the sea casts a lone survivor into the shallows.

Winter turns to spring and it’s not until after Easter before my class go on our long anticipated nature trip to look for tadpoles. Although I know it’s far to late to hope to find any.

She’s given us small red sweets that when you chew them your mouth goes all red but it shows up the plaque on your teeth. I don’t see any plaque but we all look like vampires for the day. Then, after this annoying postponement the day has finally come when we can all march off down the country lane to look for our pond life.

No doubt, you have the alternative or ‘new’ media to counter what the mainstream media says about the opposition. But how many Malaysians have access to the Internet? More than 90% of Malaysians have access to the government-controlled TV stations. So TV is by far more effective than the Internet. And the TV stations are used as the main propaganda arm of the ruling party. The opposition is fighting a losing battle in trying to counter what the TV stations report.
It can also give people a very quick temper. A majority of the emergency medevacs from McMurdo and Pole over the winters are injuries due to fights; our current doctor here on station has worked a while at Pole, and had a number of broken jaws, hands, and a lot of other fight-related injuries. There's more stories then I could remember of people completely flying off the handle for the most comically minor of reasons, like the cook putting too much cheese in the lasagna or something.

If you’re operating on this assumption and it has kept you in the rental market, you might want to actually do some online house hunting, meet with a local real estate agent and a mortgage broker, and run your own numbers to see if your assumption might actually point to homeownership as the more affordable option for you.
We accessed Rhossili Bay through the village but the walk down to the beach wasn’t as easy and the way back up rather difficult after a relaxing day on the sandy beach.
Apparently Mark is a very gassy man. I learned this from my stepmother upon my return from a stay in the hospital. While staying at my house between shifts sitting with me in my hospital room, my dear stepmom got a first hand experience of the time of classy neighbors I have. Around dinner time she heard a screech from Alma, Mark’s wife. This was followed by some wrenching noises coming from their kitchen. After this Alma proceeded to yell out, “God Mark, you’re disgusting. You’re farts stink. They stink so bad I can’t even cook!”
First, I believe that the UN is not really fulfilling its roles. I believe that the UN is just the modern version of the League of Nations. The predecessor of the UN was created after the Great War, to prevent another global conflict. If you think about it, it is quite a noble cause, after the world saw the horrors of the war, naturally the countries felt that that kind of conflict should never occur again and so the LON was born. But as we all know, Hitler unleashed his war machine on Poland in 1939 and started a global conflict that lasted until 1945. The League was supposed to make sure that such events would never occur again, that the horrors of machine guns, poison gas and trench warfare shall never be witnessed again but it failed. And look at UN and think of the conflicts that occurred after the Second World War. But in my opinion, the most important case that we should consider is the Rwandan Genocide. Hundreds of thousands of people died during the killing frenzy, while the UN stood and watched at the sidelines. Now, don’t get me wrong, I am not stating that it’s their fault nor they enjoyed what they saw, I am trying to establish the fact that the body is not serving its purpose. People were dying in the streets, women and children included, but they weren’t able to do anything to help or intervene in behalf of the victims. Just watch Hotel Rwanda and you’ll probably understand what I’m trying to say.

Sorry I haven't posted all weekend but I've been busy with the start up of my Master's Course. It looks exciting. I've already read two interesting chapters in my textbook. I'm going to have to work on my reading and writing skills along with my students. I know you'll have a thing or two to teach me.
The wood putty dries fast and sands easily so it wasn’t long before I attacked the split and the misalignment with coarse sandpaper. It’s not perfect, but I was able to gnaw down the high side to disguise the mismatch.
The gypsy boy held his head and tried not to cry. Today was his birthday. Bad things don’t happen on your birthday. He slowly walked back across the bridge and into the camp that was his home. An older woman looked up from the step of a wagon. “Ryan!” she called in alarm. There was a trickle of blood coursing down his cheek. His father looked up and raised an eyebrow as the boy was caught up in his mother’s arms, the washing forgotten.
Any help would be greatly appreciated if you could spread the word!
my bed is calling me...
and she loves me to this day
Far too many people simply think of Jesus as the baby in the manger. They see the sweet innocence and gladly embrace a child. Some even fully embrace that He was sent by God.
Wouldn't it be great to have a really good comprehensive list of resources on pregnancy loss, particularly from a Catholic standpoint, that is easy to share with someone? I think so!! It was the one thing I looked for after my first loss and never really found. There is more out there now, thank goodness, but we still need a one-stop-shop. I hope this can be one of those places.
Raven, my moody Lasidora parahybana sling died yesterday. I noticed it in the death curl, and moved it into a film container with no lid just to be sure. I am certain that she has passed, and sadly, I don’t know why. Once again I believe that the recent molt might have been at fault, but because it was less than an inch, I am unable to give a definite reason. If you have been following this blog, you will recall that the zoo just lost an Aphonopelma sp- Davis Mountain Rusty under the same circumstances. Humidity levels have been closely monitored, as have feeding practices. I am still looking into ways to prevent future losses.
Don’t get me wrong, I like exercising. I love pilates and yoga. I enjoy walking but I dislike running, it tires me out. I don’t like exercising too hard because I feel like my heart is about to pop out everytime I did that. I like dancing though. Would like to take a dance class in near future. Anyway, back to the topic, I like exercising to keep myself healthy but if I want to lose weight, it is definitely not enough. I have to incorporate a perfect balance of cardio and resistance training to lose weight the healthy way with the help of a healthy well-being diet of course.

Women, wear heavy eye makeup, tight skinny jeans with high top Nikes, tshirts or dress shirts with a leather jacket. I am not sure if it is because it was slightly chilly, but the seas of people were mostly dominated in women with black pea coats or tan trench coats.

The same senate that refuses to do any thing, finds time to pass a bill to pay off the union supporters that contribute to the majority party in the senate....really?
Enough of my inane ramblings. Hope everyone has a wonderful day.

Traci, as you know if you’ve been following this blog, had epilepsy. In the past few years she became a spokesperson for epilepsy awareness, particularly in the month of March which is Epilepsy Awareness Month in Canada. I think we first heard about Purple Day last year, in 2011. Traci was impressed that a little girl from Nova Scotia, her home province, had sparked an international campaign.

Although she is grateful that on week 2 of chemo she still has her head full of beautiful blonde hair, and I am grateful I still fit in my skinny jeans, we both kind of want that outward, visible sign that would alert people to why we're so nauseated, weak and cranky. Though she'll probably cry when she does lose her hair, and I'll look forlornly at my bikinis when I have a huge baby bump, we'll have one advantage in that we'll have a badge to wear, and a sign to others going through what we are-hey let's talk babies, I'm pregnant too! Or hey I know how you feel, I'm also battling cancer. In one way it's uncomfortable to have everyone know about your health issues, but in another way, it will be comforting to receive the support and kindness that people are generous enough to extend to both pregnant women and cancer patients.
This is the lovely Percy Pig - the only kind of pig I will eat and I even felt guilty about that ;-) He looked so sweet in his little 100s & Thousands Shorts. He was delicious and a lovely surprise for me on Easter Sunday from himself (Tech Support and Confectionery Provider!)
The base is some gorgeous Bazzill from their 'Wedding' collection - it has a soft sheen like satin and has a very soft stripe through it. Then I topped it with some silver card. I used some foam tape to pop the whole square layer on top of that - a layer of Sage Shadow and some more Bazzill from the 'Wedding' collection - this time it still has that soft sheen, but it is covered in embossed butterflies!! Around this layer I've added some 1 inch white grosgrain ribbon, some sage satin ribbon and then this gorgeous sage and white rose braid that matched perfectly!! Then I tied some white organza ribbon into a bow and added some silver cord and a white rose bud. The main panel I stamped using the Just Rite Stampers - the Brayton Font and the Rectangular Block - in black ink. The '&' is from SU's 'Together Forever' set and stamped in Sage Shadow. (Thanks HEAPS to my BFF Edna who let me borrow her set!) It was cut out using the Label 1 Nestabilities dies and then it was glued to some Sage Shadow card and I hand cut a fine edge around it. Finished off by adding some white Kaisercraft Pearls to the corner!
in World Book Night editions. Givers apply for a particular book (they get a first, second and third choice) which they must commit to gift to those who don't regularly read, to share and spread their love of reading. Givers collect their books from their local bookshops and libraries, putting the very heart of our reading communities at the very heart of World Book Night.

Sydney, Australia;
Hello everyone! I'm back from Chicago. I had a lovely time in the Windy city, which wasn't so much windy as it was rainy. Not that I'm complaining. We've had a bit of a drought here at home and temperatures in the 100's for the last couple of weeks. The rain was a refreshing change!

Also, if a new war breaks out, the rules are going to be quite different. In 2006, the IDF was ordered to avoid attacks on Lebanese installations whenever possible, giving Hezbollah a major advantage because they were able to hide rocket launchers, arms caches and fighters in civilian areas and in Lebanese government buildings. These days, Hezbollah essentially controls Lebanon, and the Israelis have made it quite clear that if Hezbollah attacks Israel again, it's going to be a war between Israel and Lebanon. And based on the Israeli realization of the fiasco that occurred with UNSC Resolution 1701 and UNFIL, this time Hezbollah may not be rescued by a ceasefire, something I’m sure Hezbollah’s leaders have considered.
In my opinion, that’s the best compliment any writer striving to get a manuscript turned into a published novel can ever receive.
30 to 35 years ago, when I was much stupider, and much, much less libertarian than I am now, I realized a fundamental problem we have is that every session of legislation adds new laws, and that even if it was just one law per session, any math geek will tell you, the number of laws, N, tends to infinity.

Even as President Barack Obama and Holder co-opt the Occupy Wall Street rhetoric of getting “tough” on the Big Banks and Big Finance, the Newsweek investigative report reveals that Eric Holder has not criminally charged or prosecuted a single top executive from any of the elite financial institutions thought responsible for the financial crash. And why would they? As Boyer and Schweizer report, “through last fall, Obama had collected more donations from Wall Street than any of the Republican candidates; employees of Bain Capital donated more than twice as much to Obama as they did to Romney, who founded the firm.”
Ironically, I recently wrote about this very thing and a lot of my ramblings in that piece are based on McGovern's work. Check out my lengthy diatribe, "Beer is as beer does", from November for the details.

After a whole month I finished the last book in the Outlander Series. I wanted to read all the time, but with work being busy I was only getting to read at night. Most of you already know, but this is my all time most favorite series EVER! This is book 7 and the author is currently working on Book 8 (there are also hints that there might be a book 9 even) This book finds Jamie and Claire headed back to Scotland to get Jamie's printing press, but they get a little side tracked and end up smack dab in the middle of the American Revolution. Bree and Roger are back in their own time, but strugling to fit in as well as some major cliff hangers for them at the end of this book. Sweet Young Ian has found Love and I look forward to see where his story goes in book 8.

I never understood why she didn’t just dive in every time. What I also didn’t understand, but now do, is that there was a freedom in both ways of entering the pool. And the beauty of both was: the utter lack of self-consciousness in the acts. Sometimes she wanted to gradually move into the pool. Sometimes she wanted to dive. Who cares if anyone’s watching?

The WDDC is an unusual place. It's a home, literally. Situated in a residential neighborhood, there's a kitchen with two volunteers cooking barbequed pork and yams, a living room with sofas and chairs and books, a dining area, and then several rooms devoted for client consultations and offices. The home is old, but still, it's a home. It feels comfortable and welcoming. Instantly upon my arrival, at least three people bid me hello and ask me if I need help. I can't tell if they're working there or the clientele.
Maybe I’m an exception. Maybe most people never experience these kinds of moments.

Secondary LCD students take high school courses in various academic subjects taught in Spanish as they continue to learn English. Courses include U.S. History, World History and Diverse Perspectives, Math, and Science. At ELC schools, content courses are offered in Spanish that include the cultural component as well, with students learning about their Latino history and culture both in English and in Spanish. Coursework is aligned with district standards to ensure that students learn the essential skills in the subject areas needed for graduation.

Heat a skillet over medium. Spread the barbecue sauce over the bread slices, then over one slice arrange cheddar cheese slices, bacon over that, then sprinkle the Monterey Jack over the bacon. Top with remaining bread slice. Melt some butter or margarine in the skillet and place the sandwich on top of the puddle, scooting it around until the bread absorbs the butter. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until cheddar looks melted, then remove and melt more butter in the pan, flip the sandwich and cook additional 4 minutes and serve hot.
TMI also described Gani’s statement as “outrageous at the very least as he was offering protection to a group of people who have not had the decency to apologise for their actions” and that the AG was “condoning vigilantism”.

Stuck in the same cramped room, staring at the same small screen, my cinematic travels have literally taken me nowhere over the years. Oh, sure, the images flickering on its glossy surface portray a wide array of people doing a wide array of things in a wide array of places, but I can't physically touch or interact with them. If I were, however, given the opportunity to enter any film I wanted, I would definitely think about entering Crimes of Passion, an unconventional, somewhat satirical, yet totally trashy erotic thriller written by Barry Sandler (Making Love) and directed by Ken Russell (Lair of the White Worm). Why, may I ask, would you want to enter that particular film? I mean, what makes it so special? And besides, everyone says they want to penetrate the film they just finished watching, it's human nature. In fact, I know someone who wanted to live like the drug-addled fashion models in Liquid Sky so badly, that they moved to Manhattan, bought a penthouse apartment near the Empire State Building, and started a trendy heroin habit. While I won't be moving to this film's location (L.A.'s skid row) anytime soon, I did notice that the desire to install a flashing neon sign, preferably one with an x-rated theme, outside my bedroom window was quite pronounced after I had finished bathing in its unsavoury glow. In other words, I want to live in a world where lightness and darkness are always fighting one another for radioactive supremacy. It's true, the inconsistencies that come with existing in a realm that features two distinct types of illumination will take some getting used to, but most will agree that the varying degrees of visual comprehension are the one of the signature perks of living life on the edge.
For those of you who just came here looking for your creative cussin' combo of the week, it's the holidays and you should be ashamed of yourselves. But—for you—I'll gladly digress:
But not all memories can be satisfying, no matter how sweet the conjured smell. After a few years of marriage I made the soup for My Man's family, hand-rolled noodles and everything. He has four brothers, and some of them have wives and children, so I had to double the recipe, but I neglected to double the seasonings. After my unaccustomed labor, I heard low voices saying, "It's a little bland." Missing something...." "Does anyone else want the salt?"

Sure enough! Papa zipped out and Mama zipped in just as I walked up. I dragged Shun over to have a look-- we could just see tiny beaks gaping for a meal. Looking around, we saw three other nests left from previous years, which seemed not to be in use (at least, not yet).
So exactly what is your objective? Well, your objective is 5k, naturally. And you should also manage to run continuously for about thirty minutes, so this is what you’re targeting. Your walking and running routine, right from the beginning should take you about thirty minutes approximately. Of course, to begin with , you’ll be alternating running and walking, but gradually you’ll end up running for a whole half an hour. This can provide you with a solid base of stamina where to run the 5k.

This is the town through which the flag-draped coffins of our fallen servicemen and women are brought home (pictured below). It is where families go to pay their respects to our glorious dead as they make the solemn journey to their final resting place. The thought of 500 hateful Islamists desecrating this place and spitting in the face of every true British citizen and the grief-stricken relatives of the dead is truly beyond the pale.
Now before you get concerned that we were being left alone, let me explain. Or should I perhaps first say that we were never left alone. In fact, I have not a single memory of ever being left with a babysitter. We went where our parents went, and they didn’t go to places where there children couldn’t go. Our parents took their role very seriously, almost to the extreme. I remember distinctly leaving the drive-in theatre during the showing of the Don Knott’s classic Love God, because of a scene which implied that he (Don Knotts) and the lead female star had slept together. Truth! As an adult, I have gone to the same great lengths to screen movies I recommend to them. I find it almost humorous that my mother’s favorite movie is Pretty Woman. But that’s another story.
By now the news had broken that Mr Sheridan’s appeal had been refused at the “sift” stage. This meant that he would not be granted an appeal hearing, because his ground or grounds of appeal were not felt to be arguable.
Did I try to search for another one at the store that I purchased the shirt from 18 months ago? Why yes I did!
A second problem is the nature of justice. Despite all of the strengths in his model, it does seem however there is an unhealthy notion of justice underlying much of it. Henry rightly states based on Romans 13 government has a legitimate role to dispense justice. However on many points he refuses to compensate for the fact that that justice is never perfect, and often working directly in opposition to perfection (i.e. utilizing repression and brutality). Though government does reflect God’s justice, some doing so better than others, it is the duty of Christians to point people towards the coming, final kingdom which is the true standard of justice and from which all authority flows.

So, there you have it. Yes, the up and down look happened to me today, and yes, it made me feel like crap. I know, I know...no one can make you feel like crap besides you but still. The fact that it was a chinless, boobless doofus doing the looking was small comfort when I already felt just blechhy about myself, about my hopelessly outdated mom clothes, about my increasingly Michelle Duggar-esque hair. I need a makeover, a head-to-toe makeover, pronto.

These people had no excuse for their isolation. They were not alone in a car. They were not surrounded by walls that created mini world that was cut off from the outside. They were on a train with hundreds of other people, like sardines in a tin can, and yet they were still isolated. Imaginary walls were wrapped tightly around the mind and the heart that created a mini world, the center of which was the individual. Their hopes their struggles, their joys and fears were all bottled up inside and they resisted people like me who tried to penetrate the icy outer layer of the atmosphere of their little world.

I’m rarely intimidated by interview subjects but I confess to feeling a little bit nervous meeting her. She was immaculately dressed and made-up, like she’d spent hours preparing for my arrival, and appeared nearly unchanged from her appearance in 1960s movies and TV shows, just a little older. I was wearing a jacket and tie and felt shamefully underdressed.
Also, compared to the other book stores we visited, it felt a heck of a lot more modern and indie. Perhaps the uneasy silence I noticed when I first walked in was more of an revered awe? This is a bookshop I plan on visiting again.. and again.. and again.

In 1965 Sunday Times journalist Peter Schirmer visited the town and wrote that in Sarmiento "more Afrikaans than Spanish is heard in the shops, bars and offices", but that is no longer the case. Today names such as Kruger, Van der Merwe, Botha, Van Wyk, De Bruyn and Eloff are still around, but the people who hold them are a far cry from the Afrikaners in South Africa and maintain little of the cultural heritage of their ancestors.
Finding archaeological objects the size of quarters when they are all or partly buried in sand and sparsely dispersed over a landscape would be difficult under the best of field conditions. There are methodologies that can assess potential for buried archaeological deposits but unless a responsible agency requires them then they are not typically part of the Phase 1 investigation. If the consulting archaeologists suspect buried deposits, s/he might propose additional investigatory work but it would be up to the responsible agency to require that this work be completed. It’s worthwhile to keep in mind that contemporary American archaeology seeks to avoid digging so we don’t just dig unless there’s a justification for doing so.

Émilie ’s most outstanding achievement is her translation of Newton’s Principia Mathematica into French with commentary. It was a complete translation of all three books with a commentary that summarized and explained Newton’s theories. She also applied the new mathematics of calculus to his ideas. This was the only complete translation of Newton’s work into French and remains the standard today. Émilie worked on this up to the time of her death and Voltaire ensured its publication ten years later.

To me it’s a good board for small jobs; even if I had purchased the larger board it just doesn’t feel substantial enough for every day use. I also didn’t get the kind with grips so it does tend to slide around without a tea towel beneath it.
My instrumental action (to seek shelter) is based on the fundamental recognition of certain universal laws which, through pattern recognition, human logic, etc. has ensured that my survival chances (as a Westerner) are much higher than that of the Noble Savage, whose historical cognizance of instrumental actions, that have proven themselves to be very successful, is very limited. An example; Thabo Mbeki’s refusal to acknowledge that AIDS/HIV is caused by a virus and his Health Minister’s advice to rather eat beetroot than take anti-virals, have definitely lessened the survival chances of their affected countrymen – a 1000 of whom die per day of this dreaded disease. So, in terms of instrumental actions (as demanded by rational behaviour) I can, with absolute certainty say, that my rationality is ‘better’ than that of the Noble Savage – simply because my survival chances are greater.
Therefore, after contemplating the thought that my ass really is reaching epic proportions, I remembered that a few weeks ago Keely mentioned that she was going to start the Couch to 5K running plan, and I was all like, "Couch to 5K? That sounds like something I could do. Well, at least the couch bit," so I got all excited, looked it up, and downloaded the app for my phone. Unfortunately, though, this in itself did not lead to the fat-melting-off-my-ass moment I was hoping for, so yesterday I finally resigned myself to the fact that I might have to actually *gasp* run (no really, that is me gasping for air at the mere thought of running.) Now, because I am such a fair skinned girl and prone to burning when I am outside for more than 5 seconds (and NOT because I am lazy and didn't want to actually go OUTSIDE *shudder*,) I elected to run on a treadmill in our building's gym.

It's his very first morning, he's just finished breakfast: a wooden bowl of porridge, and he goes to the head monk or whatever and says, just bursting with joyful anticipation of the spiritual journey that awaits him, "I'm ready to start! Tell me how I should begin." And the head monk gives him a very small, very kind smile, and says, "Go and wash your bowl."
When I told my son I had scheduled a post that mentioned Sonic the Hedgehog, and that it was for Chili Mac, he got all excited. “I know,” he said, “post a recipe for Chili Mac Dogs. That would be an original recipe.” He insisted I modifiy this post to include his original recipe.
This skirt is my third version of this 1945 pattern reproduction from Eva Dress. There are not very many patterns that I love enough to use twice, let alone three times, so you can be sure I am a fan of this one!

I took this picture back in October 2008, walking in the wood. This and my crabapple picture are my favorites so far, with the memorial bench in it.
The Gatemaker managed to lift his head off the concrete enough to face Rel, his eyes revealed as a striking silver-grey. "No more deaths?" At Rel's nod, he laid back, his eyes closing. "I got here four days ago."

The current public service strike in South Africa bears all the hallmarks of just another run-of-the-mill ethnic African power struggle. Amidst the trashed ICUs of the state hospitals, the closed shops and schoolchildren wandering aimlessly through streets overflowing with rubbish, the established elite (Xhosa President Mbeki and his cronies) are desperately trying to protect their ill-gotten gains while their main rival, Jacob Zuma (the Zulu deputy leader of Mandela’s ANC) has rallied the all-powerful trade union COSATU, the anachronistic South African Communist Party, the Brown Shirt ANC Youth League and the poor masses to his ‘noble’ cause to lead the country to Afrolantis.

Last and by FAR not least is my boys' FAVORITE of favorite sites for Vegan cuisine. I warn you, it's not for the faint of heart, nor for those like myself, who harbor a real fear of....of....of zombies! Yes, I know it's just in movies but, how do you know your neighbor isn't going to come over in the middle of the night and try to eat your brains?!?! It could happen! So, if your strong enough, you suck up your fear of REAL zombies and go to the boys' The Vegan Zombie. He has a video blog site here, FB page and even a YouTube channel! My son told me he likes him because he's funny, and he makes grown up boy food! Which is true, his recipes are insanely delicious! The boys love his Daiya cheese contest video for cheese sticks but, the pizza rolls are a HUGE hit in the house and the boys want to try a new recipe of his almost daily now. Even I have to admit, not only are his recipes really, really good but, he's made the boys lifestyle cool and they're ok with not being able to eat various things. (Fair warning, he really does do the zombie thing now and again but my boys think it's hilarious and not the least freaky!)
Last week I ate bream. It was the best most enjoyable piece of fish I’ve eaten in an age. If fish is served in heaven if will be like this: perfectly cooked, gorgeously moist, delicate and melting in the mouth with a really crispy skin served on a risotto and something green…
Anna and Abel couldn’t be more different. They are both seventeen and in their last year of school, but while Anna lives in a nice old town house and comes from a well-to-do family, Abel, the school drug dealer, lives in a big, prisonlike tower block at the edge of town. Anna is afraid of him until she realizes that he is caring for his six-year-old sister on his own. Fascinated, Anna follows the two and listens as Abel tells little Micha the story of a tiny queen assailed by dark forces. It’s a beautiful fairy tale that Anna comes to see has a basis in reality. Abel is in real danger of losing Micha to their abusive father and to his own inability to make ends meet. Anna gradually falls in love with Abel, but when his “enemies” begin to turn up dead, she fears she has fallen for a murderer. Has she?
But it's gotta be more empowering for the runner. Perhaps after six or nine or fifteen, certainly after twenty or so miles the mind must begin to peer dimly through a tunnel vision that can enhance focus but is just as able to become so transfixing as to block awareness and motivation. I imagine the runner in those fixated stretches, then a hand reaching out before them inviting, waiting passively. Then crack! It happens.
Two other teams rumored to be in the mix include the Jacksonville Jaguars (huh?) and an interesting dual spotlight between the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens. It would be a pretty good look at the contrasting coaching styles, if any, between brothers Jim and John Harbaugh and a potential Super Bowl matchup. The mental state of San Fran quarterback Alex Smith after getting caught in the Manning/Tebow (there goes that guy again) windfall. The return of Randy Moss. With Baltimore, I’m sure you want to see what life is like for kicker Bully Cundiff after his would be game-tying 32-yard field goal flew wide left against New England in the AFC Championship game. Of course it’s always good to get a share of “Sugar Bear” Ray Lewis in what could be his last NFL season.
We've already bought the fabrics and I've drafted the pattern, fitted the mock-up to her and cut the pieces out. At the moment I'm sewing the dress together. In the picture on the right you can see some examples of the materials I'm using. She wants to use the dress for less formal occassions and we decided it would be a good idea to wear it as summer dress. So instead of sewing all the poofy tulle into the dress as planned at first, I'm going to

Now lets analyze this..I am 24 weeks pregnant, have gained 20 pounds in weight(not too crazy but little crazy ) and my OB doc is going to think I gained 27 lbs. So here I am freaking out and wondering how I am going to loose at least 3 pounds before I get back to my OB doc in a week so she doesn't see how much I have gained Whew!!! That was long and tough to write and probably sounds crazy to you but trust me it is such a mind F&*K to gain weight and see the scale creep up after you have fought for so long to take it off.
Both produced by Lassissi for Sacodis, first LP includes Ouedraogo Mamadou, a singer from Burkina Faso (Album's title Dioulou Koussoube is warrior form Voltaic Army). On both Dexter Johnson still plays smooth and dense (just listen to the jazzy solos!), and Tounkara's guitar is incredible. The result remains deeply rooted in mandingo culture and voices seem like calling you from far away in time and space. But the length of theses tracks allows musicians to develop innovative sounds and arrangements which make the music unique. Additionally, quality of recording and some Cheikh Tidiane Seck's organ sounds let perceive the end of the 70s...

Invariably using good material there is no necessity for stewing or any of the careful manipulation that is usual when dealing with inferior malt, when employed for the production of pale beers. The wort is frequently, indeed, procured by making up lengths, the liquor of which has been sparged over goods at the boiling temperature, while enormous boiling quantities leading to extreme caramelisation are submitted to ebullition in closed coppers.
“Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious; and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.

I drove around the corner and was detoured by a policeman (thanks to an emergency situation), which brought me driving back around the block past my anxious little friend. I considered stopping and telling the policeman about him. What would I say? I kept driving. On the way back around, he saw me and gave me a little wave. I drove away. Feeling like a heel.

Arenas, also known as "Hibachi" or "Agent Zero" is a basketball player for the Washington Wizards. What's that? You never heard of the team? Me neither.

Getting over to the Beer Yard to pick up Jack was a traffic horror, getting through NJ was almost as bad, and when I found myself happy to be paying $4.69 a gallon for diesel, I knew things were screwed. As it turned out, I was wrong. The lecture went smoothly, and we also fit in a quick visit to the Gilded Otter brewpub in New Paltz (excellent alt, as always; a bit overly chocolatey to be classic, but not a problem when it comes to good drinking), the Tuthilltown Spirits distillery (more on that in another post...maybe, because I might be able to sell that one -- meanwhile, that's a picture of the stillhouse on the right.), and an excellent -- huge -- German dinner at the Mountain Brauhaus (highly recommended, great German fare and beers). Things got even better when I forced a visit to the Miss Albany Diner for breakfast, one of my top ten breakfast spots, a classic Silk City diner with house-made sausage and a MAD assortment of specialty omelettes and waffles (the Irish whiskey waffle is just nuts).

Of course I’m not saying that this is right or wrong. I’m just merely pointing out that it is what it is, and subsequently he is who he is. If when you met this guy he was a party guy, liked to drink a lot, like to hang in bars and showed no real signs of resembling anything remotely that of a responsible Father then why in the hell would you expect that just because you got pregnant “Tyrone, James, Rick, Bobby” or whoever would ever do a complete 180 and all of a sudden become “the one”? He won’t and you don’t possess the magic “stuff” that will turn it all around for him. Know what you’re working with, and know that if he is to become more that he has to want it more for himself more than you ever will.

Dad gives her a Latin dictionary for her birthday as her young suitor Graham does, too—which shows him as young and awkward compared to the suave and confident David. David's charm and greater sophistication are pointed up as he brings a pile of presents. David appears to be understanding and sympathetic and gets around her “simple” parents. The evil as part of Jewishness is given absolute emphasis at 105 minutes when they go to meet Rachman at the races: ”He is not the sort of person who has an office.” Rachman is eponymous and his name is a by-word for corrupt landlords. This knowledge reinforces the negativity of Jewishness in the film. The derogatory term “Rachmanism” came from him as did new laws that were passed to protect people. One scam as mentioned above was moving Black immigrant families in or prostitutes to drive elderly sitting tenants who were protected by law out. These elderly ladies are referred to a “Stats” in the film.

When I was back in my home state Arizona visiting last week, I took a little trip to see the latest in vintage stores, since I have been gone for 7 or 8 years now. I picked up a flyer for one of the local swing dancing groups and saw a tiny little ad on the back that caught my interest. The little 1" x 1" advert read, "One of kind inspiration pieces from vintage jewels that began life as brooches, bracelets and other adornments."

This time, Palin made a few remarks on Paul Revere's midnight ride. In her remarks, she mentions the tolling of bells, beating of drums and Revere warning the British that the Americans are coming.

The wedding gown had been carefully folded and tucked away. Shay ran her fingers over the delicate lace and pearls. Must’ve been crisp white in its day, but time had cast a long shadow over it. Time had a way of doing that.

This issue is so much larger than two states being manipulated and violated by a bureaucratic board in Washington–made up of people who have anything but these states’ best interest in mind. This is the curse of a centralized consolidation of power. Our founding fathers knew this all too well as they witnessed firsthand the problems of colonies ruled by a distant ruler, who believed the colonies existed to serve him. We have the same situation today; the Federal government too often acts as though the states exist to serve them, well the founding fathers believed quite differently. And until 1850, the concept of state sovereignty was implied, understood and not questioned.

For this brew I'm looking to get the gravity down to 1.042 to make it really drinkable and I'm changing the late hop from Styrian Goldings to Nugget. I've seen a few recipes using Nugget as a bittering hop, but not so many for aroma. I'll be interested to see how it turns out.

Next up, subbing the PB2 for PB in my favorite "let's pretend it's healthy" sandwich, the Adult PB&J. Peanut butter, berry all-fruit spread and ... wait for it ... NUTELLA! Yeah, my once favorite sandwich was a favorite no more. The PB2 has to be mixed to just the right consistency to make it spreadable but not watery, which, despite the instructions, I failed to do. Let's just say there was a bit extra as I fine-tuned the consistency. As with the oatmeal, it did balance the sweetness of the sandwich but failed to complement the flavors (if that makes any sense).

I also don’t agree on Orochimaru’s actions. But Kabuto wants to follow him, so I’ll just let it go and ignore it. It really doesn’t change what I think about Kabuto anyway. I will respect Orochimaru’s decision of naming Kabuto as the child of Nonou Yakushi. I feel for that relationship, even though I still don’t like Kabuto.
Starters is an amazing dystopia that brings mystery, science fiction, and so many twists and turns. I really liked that there was an element of romance, but it didn't overpower the book like it does in so many other young adult novels. I couldn't stop reading this book and I can't wait until the next book comes out.
As the years passed Oldest grew and wanted her own room so the parents made her one and she slept in there happily. After more time passed Middle did too and the parents realized that those years with their babies and children co-sleeping was coming to an end. They were both sad that those magic years with small kids had flown so fast and happy because they knew that one day they would get back the whole bedroom to themselves. And also optimistic that the magical and elusive "regular sex life" might return under the right conditions.

Today was probably a bit heavy on the participants (tell me in the comments, guys) as we discussed the topics of fellowship, growth, ministry/leadership, and the multiplication of leaders in youth ministry. Not just due to the information received but because the students also have to think through and write down ways they can apply the principles in their ministry. Looking through their notebooks later though, I found the participants were more than up to the task.

I haven't researched the reasons for British Governments dragging their feet for so long in dealing with the air pollution in London. I would imagine, if the subsequent history of business resistance to the regulation of the tobacco industry is any guide, that the coal industry, prior to and during the general election of 1945, mounted a lobbyful of resistance to clean air legislation. The Labour Government elected in 1945 nationalised a number of industries, including the coal industry. With the setting up of the National Coal Board in 1946 the government itself became the key stakeholder in the coal industry but it was still ten years before clean air legislation was passed.

“Consider, for example, a discovery the Labor Ministry announced last week: It found 200,000 people who were claiming pensions illegally, many on behalf of people who had long been dead.

I must admit that when I began to get drawn into U2's magic, I was bothered by the ambiguity of their lyrics. I would ask people, "What do you think that line in the song means?" And they would inevitably say, "I don't know." So, I would listen, listen, listen, over weeks and months and years, and along the way a phrase would suddenly erupt in meaning. Sometimes it would come because someone far more astute than me would see what was in the band's heads, name it, and the lights would go on for me. Sometimes, though, I would have the revelation myself, the scales would fall off of my eyes, and I would be gripped by something so much more powerful and weighty than what I had ever imagined lay quietly in the words. And now, over several years, I am discovering that that first opening up has been followed by more discovery, deeper meaning, a seemingly endless exploration.

Of course, I might yet confuse myself further by bringing other parts of the garden into veg-growing use, but not this year.

Growing up means training yourself not to want beyond what is reasonable. What is reasonable is hard to determine, though.

I also bought some high-end Feather razor blades. I did some reading online and figured out how to use it. I quickly found that the old-fashioned way, although wonderfully romantic and quirky, definitely had its drawbacks. Not too many knicks in the learning curve, but it took a LOT longer to shave.
