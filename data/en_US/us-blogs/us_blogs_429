The large building at 320 Washington Avenue is still inscribed "Graham Home For Ladies" The home was founded in 1851 by John Graham, Esq. He donated this beautiful plot of ground upon which was built this noble 5 story brick building in the Greek Revival / Italianate style. It operated for over a century, but after it closed the building deteriorated into a "fleabag" hotel. Now that this neighborhood has become gentrified again, this building has been rehabilitated into expensive luxury condos.

I come to Earth Day for a different reason and with a different frame of mind. “You visit the earth and cause it to overflow; You greatly enrich it; The stream of God is full of water; You prepare their grain, for thus You prepare the earth. You water its furrows abundantly, You settle its ridges, You soften it with showers, You bless it’s growth. You have crowned the year with Your bounty, and Your paths drip with fatness. The pastures of the wilderness drip, and the hills gird themselves with rejoicing. The meadows are clothed with flocks and the valleys are covered with grain; they shout for joy, yes they sing.” Psalm 65: 9-13.

Happy Thanksgiving week, everyone, and welcome to the "official" beginning of the holiday season! When I think about the many things I'm grateful for, one of the most important is this challenge and the opportunity it's given me to meet so many incredible artists who've now become incredible friends as well! Thank you all for sharing your talent, your humor and your words with me. I'm humbled every single day by the beauty you create and the heart and soul you put into your art, and I'll never be able to thank you enough for allowing me to share this experience with you.
Eternal life has less value to me than this present life, and forgive me if I sound like a doubter...because I am not. I do believe in God, and I think He has a special place for souls like that of my mother. I feel certain life exists beyond this dim plane- and people I have loved deeply have made it clear to me their love still exists for me- and is extended to me, despite being in a form I can no longer hug or touch. LOVE is an ENERGY. Period. Figure out what ENERGY is and can do and you will understand what I mean.

Steven and I have made it our habit to have a running list of people we pray for every night before we go to bed. There are some that we pray would find a true relationship with Jesus, others we pray that the the Lord would ignite a fire that has grown dim and then there are our missionaries that we love and pray that the Lord would walk along side them during difficult and dark times.

It's not the fact that you have to go early to get a spot near the fan in the summer, nor the fact that you have to hang around at the end to avoid the rush. Nor, as the guidebook says, is it the overpowering stench of feet (I guess 2 years in Iran made me immune to that!). And I can even deal with people not praying in sync - not everyone is lucky enough to have areligious education.

I just got a little card in the mail the other day from my government employer. It was a thank you card for my 15 years of service to the state. I have been in my current position for that many years. In that time, I have seen administrations come and go, and crisis pop up and fade away.

I’ve spent most of my life trying to be smart. I’ve always felt sort of inadequate or brushed aside by my peers, especially in my early years. Now that I’m an “adult” not much has changed. After attending two colleges, teaching classes, and performing the “duties” of a youth minister, sometimes I still do things for acceptance. We’ve all heard people say things like, “follow God and don’t try to please people.” The truth is that most of us, myself included, don’t care because we want to be respected and valued by people. What I’ve realized recently is that God’s way of doing things is foolish. The way that God saves people is foolish. The reason that God saves people is foolish…to mankind. God doesn’t make sense to us. Even more, He doesn’t have to make sense. He’s God. So while we all spend so much time polishing ourselves for others to see how good of a teacher we are or how well we perform at our tasks, God has a totally different grading scale. Sometimes doing things for God looks stupid to everyone else. Maybe these church growth strategies, ways to increase giving at your church, how to properly disciple people, etc. is complete garbage.
It was clearly a stand-off until one of the sides made a move; Elysia ran out of patience first and fired a Sunburst from her Wand of Illumination. The creature reeled back, blinded for precious moments, while the two party members launched their attack with magic missiles and a pair of arrows from Ferros. The creature staggered under the impact of the assault and as Elysia readied another Sunburst, it vanished.

The Ruby package looks like the best value for money and I would suggest it is the most widely bought service from Outskirts. It adds an increased on-line and trade distribution listing, increased interior/custom cover choices, six author paperback copies, and a laminated hardback option. The laminated hardback ‘option’ is in reality just that, an option to ‘upgrade’ and will actually cost the author an additional $199. I think this kind of upsell can be a bit misleading to authors, because if you actually want to take the ‘option’ then the package ups to $798. Again, there are many POD publishers who offer this hardback ‘option’ at a similar price, but Outskirts would have done better to have been more transparent with this ‘option’.

According to the angel, the task that Jesus was to achieve would be the salvation of his people from their sins.[18] On this basis, commentators have traditionally seen the role of Jesus as being a spiritual rather than political liberator. Warren Carter and others have challenged this view, arguing that Matthew had in mind not only salvation from spiritual bondage, but also social and political bondage. He states that understanding “the nature or scope of Matthew’s salvation as individual, spiritualized, and moral, is too restrictive.”[19] The sins from which the people needed saving are not explicitly mentioned in the gospel, but both the wider contexts of Scripture and history provide important hints towards understanding what Matthew was referring to.
I step into this season with an open heart, O God. As I wait for you, surprise me with the hope of Christmas that will fill the empty places.
They say this as though, whilst Capitalism continues, it is ever possible to escape the market! They say this as though they have not even noticed that the Capitalist State, they want the workers to place their faith in, is not currently cutting its workers' wages, and pensions, throwing hundreds of thousands of its workers on to the dole, as well as slashing the provision of the services it provides! Just look at the provision of Health and Education. Both of these commodities have been mass produced by the Capitalist State in the interests of Capital, in the interests of the market! Everyone knows that these commodities are not provided equally or on the basis of need, and every survey shows it. In affluent areas, not only is the need for Health, Education and Social Care less, because those in these areas already enjoy better lifestyles, access to culture, books, computers etc, and everything that goes with it, but these areas, DESPITE that, get better provision of these services than deprived areas. Some of that is due to simple things such as the fact that teachers generally prefer to teach in areas where they can obtain success, and there is no problem recruiting GP's to work in affluent areas, but always a shortage of GP's for deprived areas. But, the real reason is that in affluent areas, Labour-Power, particularly high value, skilled, educated, Labour-Power is in short supply, and it is in these areas that the high-value businesses tend to be located. In deprived areas, however, it is usually low value, low skilled industries, which have plentiful supplies of low-paid, low skilled, poorly educated workers, who can be easily replaced out of the Reserve Army of Labour, constantly available in such places.

When thirteen-year-old Johnny's talking computer Kovac detects an extraterrestrial signal, his life is set to change for ever. Soon things start happening around him that Johnny doesn't understand: why is his mother, who is on life support in a hospital for the criminally insane, being guarded by sinister looking men? And why was a journalist murdered shortly after Johnny talked to him? His search for answers takes him farther from home than he could ever have imagined, on a spectacular journey through time and space.
And yes, it is a psychological reality that individuals will seek out information which confirms their world view (and their drastic decisions). It is comforting. There, I admit it.
The explosion and fire that sank the Deepwater Horizon oil rig killed 11 workers. One of the last workers to escape the explosion was Mike Williams, a technician working for Transocean, the company that leased the oil rig to British Petroleum. In a television interview broadcast in May 2010, Williams exposed the central role played by BP executives in creating the conditions that led to the massive blowout of crude oil from the well.

The Citadel actually won a few more games than it lost in the seasons leading up to World War II. Of course, the competition in those not-so-organized times wasn’t always the best. In 1917, for example, The Citadel defeated the Charleston Navy Yard Machinist Mates 48-11. In 1925 the Bulldogs beat Standard Oil 46-18, and in 1932 The Citadel recorded a 42-23 victory over the Jewish Alliance. Alas, the Bulldogs’ 62-51 loss to the Savannah Ice Service in 1941 was a sign of things to come, because after the war things turned south in a hurry.
So there is nothing worse than loosing your children in a terrible country with a stupid cop investigating, when they are into kiddie stuff also. So when you can not trust man who do you trust? So 365 days of prayers almost over and still waiting for a discovery in which I believe and hope before she turns 10 years. Who is interested in a 3 day fast every month on the 2nd and 3rd and 4th day while praying to God. I am keen I challenge anyone else to it. You can drink water, tea, coffee etc but no food for 3 days every month for one year. We must all suffer as she suffered and go through this for other children also, to keep us more compasionate.
The exhibition presents a variety of myths focused on the controversies surrounding urban life: the implied connection between abject poverty and criminal behavior, an implicit cynicism over the effectiveness of rehabilitation, and the questioning of the dynamic between law and crime. Rather boldly, Roth actually takes a stand on these urban questions and the installation seems to give a series of answers to these questions.

Another part of my psp was washing my cloths with cold water. I have found that I can’t tell the difference between washing my cloths with cold water or warm water. Also I will like the money that I save on electricity if I continue to do this. I tried drying my cloths outside in the sun but I ran into a couple problems a couple days my cloths got rained on. Also when my cloths were dried outside they felt a little stiff and uncomfortable when I wore them. So I think that I will continue to wash my cloths with cold water but I am also going to dry them in a drier after.

If a substance is higher in pH (more alkaline) the more electrical resistance the liquid holds. This means that electricity in our bodies travel slower with a higher pH. When conditions are more acidic, electricity runs fast and resources are burned up quickly.

The Taepodong is an ICPM and a very big risk to America’s west coast, to Hawaii, to Japan, and other targets. The first one was launched in 1998 so the North Koreans have had plenty of time to improve their technological mastery. The same, of course, can be said for their nuclear weapons.

has been a practicing Buddhist monk since entering the Palyulchoekhorling Nyingmapa Buddhist monastery in Bir, India, in 1987 at age 16. For the first 17 years he studied and practiced in the Nyingmapa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, receiving training in meditation, Buddhist scripture and philosophy, tantric ritual, lama dancing and music. He has received many tantric empowerments and sutra teachings from His Holiness the Dalai Lama and many other High Lamas, including late H.H. Penor Rinpoche. In the last several years he has worked on health related projects for his monastery as well as overseeing his nephew and nieces. He currently makes his residence in Dharamsala, India in the foothills of the Himalayas; his home is less than a minute walk from the Temple and residence of the H. H. Dalai Lama. Currently, he facilitates cultural exchange programs between the Tibetan community and US university students who come to Dharamsala to volunteer with Lha Charitable Trust, a local social work agency devoted to improving the lives of Tibetan refugees and local Indians.

In keeping with our metaphor, violence is a powerful prop on the stage of life, and some kids cannot resist seizing and wielding it against others. Dijana what we need are some real life stories. Ideally you can find a kid who performed the bully role, as well as someone who experienced the bullying. What was that like for them? How does a middle schooler use/respond to violence? How do kids move on? What options are out there? The one bullet point that stood out in your storyboard was the “Student story (true story) about unknowingly using a loaded gun as intimidator and killing a friend”. Perhaps you can interview this person? In answer to your question, no fictional reporting is allowed. Our aim is to tell real stories that connect with our audience. While your volunteer work can provide context for your reporting, the program and agenda should not be the focus. You will need to talk to actual individuals about their gang experience before you can storyboard.
The corporate revolution of consciousness argued in favour of the amendment, if not abolishment of corporate personhood for ecologically destructive corporations; i.e those in violation of mother earth’s ecological carrying capacity laws of sustainability, social traps. An individual or entity’s honourable legal standing, comes not from their corporate charter to rape and destroy the planet, consuming resources as if future generations and other species are irrelevant and worthy of extermination purely for the corporations short term profits; but from an individual or entity’s practice what they preach ecological footprint conduct.
You may think that social media is a fad and will go away or will not affect financial professionals. The truth is that social media is here to stay—in one form or another. There are more than 800 million people on Facebook sharing and passing along information to one another. The fastest growing segment on Facebook is the over-65 age group. LinkedIn has more than 120 million users—most of which are executives and businesspeople, actively using the medium.

His frustration that I just did not understand what he wanted (because surely he did not want, y'know...the actual slang meaning) and wasn't readily giving up the poon was growing by the second. He was becoming more and more adamant in his want...no his need for poon!!!

Yesterday was my bookkeeping day, but it was so lovely out, I decided to take a side trip at lunch time to Plymouth's lovely old greenhouse, rationalizing that I could pick up some plants for Allegan. I used to love to visit the greenhouse where we lived in Chicagoland. It was huge. And old. And famous -- it was featured in the movie "Flat-liners*." Plus it was right around the corner from our house. One of my favorite spring rituals was to pack my son, Jack, in his wagon and head over, wandering for as long as he could stand it down its beautiful rows of plants. We had quite a big yard then, and it was great fun to pick out new plants to try together. As fate would have it, when I was putting yesterday's choices in the trunk, a young mom and her son pulled up, and began their search for the perfect wagon to pull down the rows. Every wagon her son tried was too big, so I hurried up so I could offer the one I had used -- a red Radio Flier, just the right size for small boys to pull. "Come on, Jack," she said as she thanked me for the wagon. Her son was Jack, too! Made me smile. There's just something wonderful about spring, wagons, flowers and boys!! xo

Combine water, milk, butter in a large bowl and microwave until melted. Stir and set aside to cool to room temperature. If you crack in the egg right away, you'll end up with scrambled eggs. To help the mixture cool, I stirred in the corn syrup first, and at this point it was cool enough for the egg. The cold egg will cool it down further so that it is at a good temperature to activate the yeast. You want the liquid to be at around 110 degrees, so put your finger in and if the mixture feels warm, it's at a good temperature.

Contemporary science is based on the philosophy of materialism, which claims that all reality is material or physical. There is no reality but material reality. Consciousness is a by-product of the physical activity of the brain. Matter is unconscious. Evolution is purposeless. God exists only as an idea in human minds, and hence in human heads.

The Georgia Nicholson Diaries: This is a series of ten books by a comedian that are the diary of a teenager, and they are hilarious!

We have all read the harrowing news stories of the events in Japan this past week. Earthquakes of magnitudes not often seen before, tsunamis and now the potential threat of failure of at least one nuclear power plant have seen Japan ravaged. The scale of destruction has reached leaves beyond full comprehension. Headlines of thousands dead, 100s of thousands displaced and homeless speak of a disaster not seen in Japan since August 1945 when American dropped two bombs to bring an end to the Pacific element of the Second World War.
Scottish Philosopher David Hume’s essay ‘Of National Character’.had an original 1753 footnote which read:
This is a somewhat controversial decision as Dovizioso is 3rd in points right now, ahead of Simoncelli and the injured Pedrossa. However only 1 win in his career on a factory Honda is not helpful towards a long term future. Simoncelli’s results are inconsistent to say the least but he at least can generate headlines and has the potential to be great. But he has to preform. He’s 8th in points at the moment. Behind the struggling Ducati’s of Hayden and Rossi. He’s far behind Dovizioso and far behind Ben Spies, who has already scored his first win. Pedrossa missed races and is miles ahead of him. For Simoncelli to keep a factory ride in the future (with Honda or at another team, Ducati?) he’ll need to show serious improvement next season and win a race or two.

Tree frogs are another love of mine. Today’s find were two ceramic tree frogs that grace the bookshelf in my office. We have had clouds and rain over the past week and for some odd reason I had a vision of umbrellas, clouds, the moon and tree frogs raining from the sky. I suppose it is a little bit Daliesque and perhaps he is the subconscious influence to my temporary insanity, however I enjoyed creating this piece more than most.
*Once there are 5 minutes remaining on the timer, open the lid and add the frozen peas and the shrimp, with the juices, and close again to finish cooking.
And when Adam and Eve gazed into the eyes of Cat, they recognized that they were not the Supreme Beings on Earth.
Last week I had a big time craving for some Asian flavored food. The ginger and garlic and soy and PEANUT SAUCE! Mmmmm. I decided to make some really lean turkey meat balls and some green beans. What really sent this dish over the top though, was the thick peanut sauce that I drizzled over top. Actually, it was so thick that I'm not sure drizzle is the right word. Maybe slop. Or slather. Yes, slather is the right word.
In honor of the recession-that-experts-say-is-over-but-tell-that-to-the-unemployed, I'm only doing 9 Buzzwords this year. Everyone has to cut back.
Let’s consider the opposite case. I remember, watching the director’s commentary on The Empire Strikes Back (Greatest Sequel of All Time), how Irvin Kershner spoke about his emphasis for directing the film: character. (In fact, it was he who awoke me to this central fact about successful sequels.) He reasoned that people who come to watch a sequel care about the characters, and therefore the central element in his movie would be the relationships between the characters, developing the love story between Han and Leia and focusing on Luke’s growth toward maturity. The arc, and emotional draw, of the story is essentially this: characters about whom we care are in trouble. You are invested in the sequel because you care about the characters. You care about what happens to them. You enjoy watching them get into and out of trouble together. And the satisfaction of the film (and its re-watchability) is that spending time with the cast is like visiting with friends whose company you enjoy.
This was the second statement from Proton in a week, although it sent a clearer signal that something may be brewing at the national carmaker.
I haven't been paying as much as attention to the soon-to-be-released Common Core State Standards as I probably ought to be, given my profession. I just took a glimpse at the Web site, which today includes nothing more than the logo and the statement, "The Common Core State Standards will be available at this link Wednesday, June 2 at 10 a.m. Please check back at that time." Taking a closer look at the logo, I saw the motto, "Preparing America's students for college & career." I realize that I occupy a place of great privilege; for me, for example, going to college was a near certainty that I should not take for granted. Nevertheless, though I recognize that for far too many children, going to college or preparing for a challenging career may be extremely ambitious and daunting goals, I cannot believe that preparation for "college & career" is really all that a good K–12 education is for.
How in the world did this last month just fly by? Time is just going faster and faster. Once school started, we have been in the whirlwind of life. Every night is busy with some kind of practice or small group or activity and each week just disappears before I can get a blog post written and posted.
It’s necessary to think about what we need and what we desire everyday.
The Associated Press comes in next, featuring what is in reality an op-ed, but promoted as a news item. Titled, “Putin Returns to Presidency in a Changed Russia,” it reiterates the US State Department’s propaganda by claiming the limited protests funded and organized by the US State Department through its National Endowment for Democracy (NED) front and its various subsidiaries, constitutes a “growing portion of society,” that is “no longer willing to silently tolerate a government that denies its citizens a political voice.”
The Blueshirts were tenacious in the corners and along the boards in the Washington zone, and they made life miserable for the Caps’ defense. The Rangers outhit the Caps 21-10 in the first period; the two teams were virtually even in that department the rest of the way. Ten of New York’s first-period hits were leveled against Washington defensemen.
I went in, trotting to save my scarf from doing an Isadora Duncan in the fierce sucking hush of the automatic doors closing in my wake and made my way to the FastBacks. I love the FastBacks. It’s all the stuff which is just out and you can only keep for a week. Which is more than you need to read a book. I did “War and Peace” in four days. An elderly gentleman and I tussled over the latest Michael McConnelly but breeding, respect and manners won through and he conceded the book to me.*
Here they are not only confronted by the daunting task of carving a homestead out of the vast primeval forest, but also the ever-present danger of living as a devoted couple in a world where the possibilities of humiliation and death stalked them at every turn if their secret should ever be discovered.

On the 22nd of this month, HootyCutie Designs will have been open for one year on Etsy! Something that was suppose to be a little side thing for fun has turned into so much more. I'm so glad that I did this blog in addition to the shop. It is kind of like a time capsule and I am able to go back and see how HootyCutie has evolved (more on that to come).

No idea where it came from but I had the idea of a long abandoned Tea-tray, My house is fit to burst with my old tat so I thought I better start working on some outside art. I have the romantic vision of a long gone relative sitting in the garden with a cup of tea reading his books - he left the tray behind and it has now been found - very weather worn - I often worry about how my mind works...
I grew up in a small town. Very homogeneous, white, poor, and secluded. Not everyone I grew up with feels this way or would dare speak of it if they did. But there are a few who are absolutely clueless as to how the world works. And you can’t argue with stupid. They choose to remain ignorant and that is the most dangerous thing about them. This is why when I was given the chance I ran as fast as I could away from that place. Only to return to the home of my parents and to stay there, rarely venturing out to mingle with the towns people. To this young man I think the best response can only be:
Fade in…… What???

The 203 weapons seized in the operation included handguns, AK-47 and AR-15 style assault rifles, and a .50-caliber sniper rifle. Pitman said all of the weapons were purchased legally from licensed dealers.
When I was in college, over 50 years ago, I recall seeing a debate between our campus team and a visiting team from England. One of our bright lads buttressed his arguments with quote after quote from published writers. Not to be outdone, the first English debater stepped forward and proclaimed, "The quickest way to elevate fiction to fact is to quote someone else as having said it." I never forgot that moment.

She’s having dinner with Young Ho at the hotel. She wonders if it’s okay to be seen with him and since he’s single, it’s okay. She asks about the woman who left his daughter, Ji Woo, in the lobby of the hotel that time. He tells her that it was just a woman he was seeing and it reminds him to ask her about Gwan Woo. Is she meeting Young Ho because she’s bored? No, she’s seeing him because she owes him money. Gwan Woo is just a kid that she dotes on. He wants to know if Gwan Woo was the appointment she was supposed to meet that day. She admits that they were supposed to see the Ryan McGinley exhibit together.
I finally finished reading The Neverending Story to the kids last week. This book is not meant to be read a few pages at a time. When read in such small chunks it does seem endless, and not in a good way.
On a visit to Summerfete the other day she mentioned a blog called Molly Flanders. I popped over for a visit and was thoroughly inspired by her beautiful work and use of colour. When I saw these hexagon flowers laid out I just couldn't stop thinking about them. After laying in the bath waxing lyrical to Mr Bun (sat in the chair beside me) about the beautiful colours, the shapes and how I want one too I decided to get on with it there and then that night.

The next is a photo collage I did from photos I took of the Statue of Liberty, which stands on Liberty Island which is also in New York's Harbor. I blogged about Lady Liberty on this post. She is a very important icon for me as my maternal grandmother sailed by her on a ship in 1912. She then went through immigration on Ellis Island. I wish I knew what her experiences on Ellis Island were like. All my Mother knew was that my grandmother came with papers that instructed where she should be sent, and she was put on a train to meet her sponsor in Pennsylvania, with those instructions pinned to her back. I can't imagine how brave my grandmother had to be to leave her homeland at nineteen years old, see the ocean for the first time in her life, and then get on a ship and cross that ocean. Happily, her decision to take that chance would give her, and her future family, many opportunities!

A CNY dinner gathering with ex and current colleagues at Nex. After reading review at Soshiok.com, we decided to try Crystal Jade Korean BBQ buffet. The concept is rather similar to Seoul Garden serving BBQ cum hotpot buffet that include cooked dishes, snacks, desserts, ice-cream and drinks. Not the real authentic kind of Korean BBQ, rather localised version of Korean BBQ. Prices are attractive and affordable but the buffet quality was not satisfying and rather disappointing though it's look like a good spread.

What I like: What sets the Open Doors (OD) catalogue apart is that it’s exclusive to aiding Christian people in difficult circumstances and hence allow the gospel to go forward. So all the gifts are specific to the needs of Chrisitans worldwide who are suffering or under persecution. Gifts like ‘Send two children whose fathers have been martyred to school for a year’ are unique and you can’t really find anything like this in the other catalogues… it’s great that someone is specifically looking out for these needs!

The only way to address the issue of a garden that frankly looks like SHIT is to work on sections at a time and this is what I did earlier today…and I was surprised at how long it took….while one feels great after doing something – i.e. gardening it does in fact piss me off no end. I started at 5pm ish and ended up at 8 pm…as it grew darker….Eventually it’ll all look much nicer….I don’t think I’ll plant veg, but I’ve often hankered for beds of Rosemary – the scent of their flowers is very nice, and it’ll be nice to see Bee’s especially the Bumble variety and Butterflies zooming about sampling the nectar….and being finally able to sit in the garden on warm summer evenings supping a G & T once in a while…oh, and it will of course increase the value of the property….(sic)
So for now, my blog story ends with what is probably a period. The Vane family is back under one roof, LV is happily-ish ensconced in a new school where she is not being secretly taught about Jesus. Instead she is mixing up other traditions and came home a few weeks ago announcing that on Eid, a person gets to stay home and eat apples and honey all day. She is planning a vampire faerie costume for Halloween. I am reading wikipedia articles on chemotherapy (seriously) and visualizing clumps of hair on my beautiful wood floors in an attempt to psych myself up for the Next Great Smoking Cessation, to begin when the weather gets genuinely cold. I am comfortably in the midterm mode of my teaching performance and my students seem so far to respond in the ways I expect them to; they like me, for the most part. Mr. V and I are remembering how to share parenting during the weekdays; the inevitable quibbling that results is nothing in comparison to the luxury of having someone else to pack lunch and do end of day pick up. The CAT has settled on her favorite sun spots on the back porch and the front porch. She never kills songbirds, despite all that you readers gave me to look forward to. I miss football this season, but I can't root for Ben. I made amazing manicotti last weekend. And sweet potato pie with vanilla whipped cream. And the bakery down the street sells amazing baguettes.

I’ve called my talk “The Adam Sandler Art House Movie,” because it nicely encapsulates the contradictions and difficulties in approaching this movie. Punch Drunk Love responds to, and even builds directly off of, the stereotypical roles that Sandler usually inhabits. But, at the same time, it is all presented within an off-beat, challenging, visual and aural style that comes right out of an aesthetic stretching back to the days of the New Wave.

Mom had an upsetting encounter with a psychologist last week. For her to get her spinal cord stimulators (implants that block pain signals), the insurance company requires a psychological evaluation (similar to that for transplant patients) before we can proceed. The psychologist was rude and condescending to Mom and told her that how fast she got sick, how many doctors she has seen (because no one could figure her out and kept referring her to other) and having me as a service dog were all bad coping techniques. He didn't want to learn what I do and wouldn't answer Mom's, Grandmom's or Granddad's questions about what he meant. Mom is worried, since if this guy says no, Mom won't get her SCS's. So everyone keep your paws crossed that he says yes!

Yet, thinking about sitting behind that wheel, being in control of the engine and having that responsibility at my feet leaves me cold. Actually that's not true. If I think about driving my minds higher function disappears and my autonomic nervous system reveals it is incredibly strong. Sweating - check. Nausea - check. Feelings of dread - oh yes. Palpitations - badaboom - literally. Oh the list is endless. Bleurgh. It is exhausting.
His sister, Naseeb, had gotten married and was teaching elementary school when she got sick. My grandpa was with the group that took her to the hospital for treatment in the middle of the night--only to be refused by the doctors because it was late, and the hospital only accepted patients during standard working hours. My grandpa saw his sister die that night before the hospital opened its doors.
I started Wellbutrin in the spring, and I think that’s what saved me. I finally was able to focus again. I could feel myself developing the old connection I’d had with my work. I did well, which was needed if I ever planned on trying to go for a Ph.D. So if I ever apply for one, I could explain overcoming my obstacles and yadda yadda yadda.
On typical weeks, we have at least humble attempts at meal plans, but with a fridge half-full with Christmas dinner leftovers and a stomach bug floating through our home, our plans went by the wayside. Instead of planned meals, we had humble fixings, turning instead to simple sandwiches to use up extra meats and breads, cheese and crackers, or other small-plate meals. We did a lot less heavy cooking (fine by me) but often failed to remember to make our meals balanced. It's too easy to forgo a veggie dish if you don't have sliced veggies in hand in the fridge and everything else is a 2-minute prep time.
I do have some make-y things coming up with Handmade 2012. In fact its part of why I do those things, so I can get in the zone by setting that time apart. It combines my love of making things by hand while making meaningful connections with others.

Another comment was made that perhaps the statement refers to the (American) Christian church becoming a by-word to many, because it has grown lukewarm. The latter is true in many cases, however, it is not persecution.

If you do not know the film by reputation, perhaps you have heard the most frequent pop cultural reference from the film--someone clapping while chanting, “One of us!

Most recently, Howard made this joke in reference to Penny hanging out with the geeks on The Big Bang Theory.

At the same time, I also feel bad for him. His generation has seen the once proud role of "power hitter" turn into something to be chemically brewed and ultimately distrusted. For my son, the Major League Home Run Kings are mutated narcissistic brutes named Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, and Barry Bonds. I feel sorry for them because these kids never had the pleasure of witnessing Hank Aaron honorably climb to the top of 'round-trip' mountain. They never had the humble example of Hank Aaron confidently and quietly carrying the crown as 'King of the Game'.
Kayla and Scott Sniezek have a one year old son named Ford. Ford was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Yesterday, their house was destroyed by a fire...and they lost everything. Scott’s father then collapsed and died of a heart attack after trying to run back into the house to save some of Ford’s medical equipment. The fire is thought to have been arson.

Villagers were stunned by the assault on their landscape and protested at the first available meeting of Walditch parish council. One of their number is writing to the Local Government Ombudsman. Another has written to John Greenslade, chief planning officer at West Dorset District Council. “Perhaps you would be good enough to inform us what consultation (if any) took place with WDDC or parish council before this “industrialisation” of a country lane took place and what you propose to do to ensure that the bank is restored to its original protected form.”
I need 100% quiet while I’m writing. However, quiet is a precious commodity with two sons and a husband who like to play his music loud. So I am often forced to drown the noise out with music.

Home remodeling is not for wusses. During my growing up years, there is only a couple of houses that I recall not being involved in a remodeling job of some sort. My mother had this innate ability to take something ugly and make it beautiful. I remember one particular house that I went with them to look at. I remember walking into this four walled container of fecal matter and telling my parents that I would not move into that house if they decided to buy it. It seriously looked like someone had urinated on the walls or something in the front room. The toilet was so disgusting. The house smelled horrible.
The great Welsh national anthem“Land of My Fathers” is a is a pertinent example as it makes a clear statement of debt to forebears and suggests the piety necessary to honour what the ancestors have left us and our obligation to hand it on to our descendants. This is embodied in the Fifth Commandment to honour thy mother and father. Unless they are very cruel parents, of course.

Unfortunately, last week, the Party for Freedom decided to end its support for the government. As you can imagine, this was a difficult decision for us, given the many things also on the subject of Islamization that we were still to achieve. Unfortunately, however, previous Dutch governments — as governments elsewhere in Europe — have signed away a significant part of our own sovereignty to the EU, the European Union, a supranational institution run by unelected and undemocratic bureaucrats.

What I like about Americas Press is the way they present their company—a book printer with a simple no-nonsense approach, not looking to engage in the DIY self-publishing bandwagon, and understanding that the discerning author who understands self-publishing is often looking for a quick print turn-around, together with additional options of bookmarks, leaflets and posters.

Although I already know the basics for most of the techniques I wanted to refresh my inkpad knowledge and use the spur of the classes to revisit techniques I've not used in ages. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and still have things I didn't get chance to finish during the course but I have the lessons saved so I can work through them when my mojo deserts me for a while. Anyway, the piece shown above was my very first attempt at creating a background by stippling. I have always used Cut'n'Dry foam to create a similar effect and once in a while I've used brushes but in a sweeping motion not actually stippling with a pouncing action. I was really chuffed with the effect I achieved and then continued by adding the stamped Clarity trees and Chocolate Baroque wild flowers to complete the picture. The poem excerpt is also a Chocolate Baroque stamp.

But, covering the Nobel Prizes provides such a fantastic opportunity to explore great writing that covers many disciplines at many levels, it’s worth collecting and highlighting the short-form and long-form articles that left their mark on me this year.
The explanation given is, low fat dairy products lowers blood pressure. Previous research suggests that adequate vitamin D levels may help prevent development of high blood pressure.
THEMIS is currently pondering a new series of data which suggests that when the two magnetic fields line up, together they create a ‘huge breach, and there’s lots and lots of particles coming in’- David Sibeck’s words.

Because I always burn the bottoms of pans when making any kind of milk-based sauce, I chose to ignore it, and instead continued to put 100 per cent concentration into my stirring. The sight of a mouse in my kitchen would normally make me feel physically sick, and I would do the whole standing-on-a-chair thing, screaming blue murder (despite growing up with mice in my Mum's house).
Siskind’s most recent album “Novel” was released in 2011 and features her powerful voice while utilizing traditional instruments, including her beloved Gibson, as well as salt canisters, dry rice, and oatmeal boxes as a percussion section. She made a snare out of a storage box with sheets of paper taped to the top. Swept away by the muse, Sarah would continue to record the rest of the songs this way, finishing it with just one microphone, several guitars (including her beloved Gibson, Larry), and “found sounds” from her home back in Nashville. Sarah engineered, tracked and produced “Novel” with no boundaries, no one else in the room, on her own.

I find this argument fascinating in the US as well. Of course, once the bubble burst a premium was placed on renting as credit markets seized up and people switched to renting and were unable to obtain a mortgage. Yet once that short-term premium is exhausted rental values begin to find a natural equilibrium. Take a look at the Las Vegas market and you can see a tipping point in rents emerge.
The Notes of Debates in ConText addresses a real need in our constitutional scholarship. There is currently no systematic, accessible commentary on the Notes that explains the details and context of each decision made at the convention, while also describing the subsequent (and ongoing) debates over constitutional meaning that have stemmed from those decisions. With this site, we are providing the most up-to-date analysis of the Framers’ debates by some of the country’s leading academic voices. This project too offers registered users a chance to add their own comments. Discussions about the meaning and current importance of the convention’s decisions could conceivably get heated.
A minister dies and is waiting in line at the Pearly Gates. Ahead of him is a guy who's dressed in sunglasses, a loud shirt, leather jacket, and jeans.
“That’s ludicrous!” with all of the correct enunciation and emphasis that one should use for such a statement. She had also never used this word before, so it was quite the moment.
The article alleged that a group of pastors had participated in a gathering in Penang recently, together with DAP elected representatives including Ooi.
Take, for example the Easter Baptisms at Trinity… there had been so many wanting to be baptised in March that another service had to be laid on, and as with each of them, the church was packed. It is so exciting to hear individual stories of how encounters with Christ have led to transformed lives. One person may have struggled with depression, another with addictions; one person may have had everything they’d wanted but felt completely empty inside, another may have come only to stop the wife badgering them; some have had dramatic encounters with Christ, others have had an ongoing journey for years; but each unique story is a testimony to the power of Jesus Christ.

The only thing I changed up was instead of two cups of the Milk Chocolate Chips I used one cup of the Milk Chocolate and one cup of some white chocolate chips I had on hand that needed to be used. The combo of the white and milk chocolate was pretty yumtastic...just ask my kids!
Hi friends! Hope you all have been well. I want to start off by saying I have been working my butt off pulling up carpet and stripping off 2 layers of wallpaper that has been covered by 2 layers of paint. Yes, it is worth it. I am doing it for my big little son so he can have his own room that isn't a pit. And it is worth it because 12 years ago, I promised this old house (107 or so years old) that I would save it and help return it to its former simple beauty that existed before idiots came along and did their best to screw it up. I am making small steps, but steps nonetheless.

I was the 2010-2011 Wilber Czech Queen for my hometown. It was an experience that is a life changer! I traveled to many new places and got to meet a ton of new people. I wanted to do a little review over it to fill all of you in on all the things that happened that year so here's my story.
Twin Peaks – soundtrack. Best TV show! I can’t let go of the feelings I had when watching it, and this soundtrack helps me hold onto that. It’s also the only series I’ve ever watched in its entirety twice in a row. (I have a “7 year rule” usually for reruns.)

It is a pity that all the legitimate and deserving success and achievement that women have acquired over the ages is coming to naught just by the arrogant and selfish notion that it is a woman’s right to create and destroy. Sad that real feminism is being murdered right under the eyes of the genuine feminists who clearly know what it feels like to ‘not have’ and then ‘achieve something’ only to lose it due to the hypocritical attitudes of some foolish and egotistical women. These female chauvinists forget that there are several women in the villages, little towns and cities who are silently carrying around the torch of feminism making a difference in the life of so many people without making much hue and cry about it. They are helping those in need irrespective of caste, community, status or gender.
Take one tower containing 48 blocks. Write a multiplication question on each of the two widest sides of each block with a sharpie pen. I was able to write all facts of 1′s through 9′s multiplying by 1 – 10. With the remaining blank spots I wrote things such as “Count by 3′s to 30″ or “0 X any number” (in which the child would reply “equals zero”).
For the summer's second batch of saison I changed the late additions to just Saaz (an ounce each at 15 minutes and knockout). The blend of Saaz, Hallertau, and S. Goldings produces a nice flavor but I wanted to see if I could get away with something simpler. This one attenuated to 1.001 in a reasonable amount of time, so no over-carbonation problem. I'm not sure this one is quite ready yet as it has a raw yeasty smell that I've found with bottles that have not undergone enough conditioning time. There is a nice saison there, but I will have to show some patience for it to shine.
Watch this video see how Hope2Africa is being used to bring hope and eternal changes in otherwise hopeless situations.
“In another point, the authors have asked the question: ‘Could such wholesale sabotage of agriculture as took place in the Soviet Union take place in the United States of America?’ They then answer the question that, regardless of how fantastic it might sound, such diabolical sabotage was actually practiced by German saboteurs in 1915 in the United States of America.”
The first two books that I would like to tell you about are Waiting For Wings by Lois Ehlert and Where Butterflies Grow by Joanne Ryder. They both have beautiful pictures, and in my opinion are appropriate to read to pre-k, k, or 1st-graders. Both books discuss the life cycle of the butterfly and introduce vocabulary that our students will find really interesting.
Previewing a post, The sidebar was gone! I felt naked and exposed with no where to go from the post I was viewing. I was frightened, worried for my three readers and my mother visiting the site and getting lost without a clear way to navigate around to all the goodness I’m sharing here.
Cpt. Maeric smiled, a warm and inviting smile that softened his rough- but not unpleasant features. He was a big-boy, having grown up on rugged Ares, he had first served in the Colonial Marines, looked every bit a Marine too: close cropped hair, bulky build with squared shoulders and jaw...for as much as he loved the physical endures of being a Marine, he decided to join the Fleet after his stint with the Marines was up- and fell in love with the stars as much as his love for all things of nature. Now he was Viper pilot, a squadron leader, and a damn fine one at that.
Basically, all I did was cut strip paper and punched it with my Fiskars Apron Lace border punch. The best way to fold it evenly is to score between every other scallop on one side and then turn it over and score between the scallops you did not do on the first side. Then fold on the score lines like a fan, put the two ends together with adhesive, shape it into a circle and glue down. The width of the strip of paper will determine the diameter of your rosette and the length will determine how many pleats it has.The trickiest part for me was holding it in place while I was gluing it.
Today that changed. You have to tune in you see - focus. They're there, but not that apparent until you see one, which then enables you to see another, then another and then, before you know it, they're popping up everywhere.
The louder liberals talk about some ancient constitutional right, the surer you should be that it was invented in the last few decades….
I have had Apocalipse looked over, since he was lame, from cutting his hoof, (see the “hoof injury” category.) I have had Apollon looked over since he was having trouble with some of the dressage things, moving sideways in particular, and he turned out to have problems with his right hip. I have had them all tested and treated for worms, I have been busy, along with my Ferrier, correcting Saleem’s hoof after his hoof abscess, (again, the hoof injury category for pictures.) The damaged hoof has been growing three times as fast as the others, and has been collapsing rapidly as well, forcing us to get special shoes on him and making my Ferrier come by often. I have had Saleem vaccinated twice, in order to follow the new rules for vaccination, only to have the rules changed on me- again.

Charley Wilkison of CLEAT likes to point out that many police unions were originally organized out of the evidence room in their department's basement because an assignment there historically is how departments punish or sideline officers with a history of disciplinary problems, who also happen to be among the most likely to agitate for unionization in order to protect their jobs. Whatever the benefits for unions, though, the public is better served when evidence rooms are run by dedicated, civilian professionals with clear policies and procedures about what should and shouldn't be in the evidence room, when, and why.
Most of the Characters and beliefs systems of our Authority figure in our childhoods are how our believe systems were mostly formed. But, do not judge them for in the same way you judge it will be judged to you. Eg. If you judge your authoritarian father you are likely to be judged the same way as you take care of responsibilities and your kids. You can share what you have gone through to others, but without judging, though sometimes the truth of your judgmental might needed to be shared and released for the purpose of healing. Even if it happen, we are to ask forgiveness to God and release forgiveness to anyone who might have hurt you as well, but being open to share to someone all that you have gone through and who would listen to you and pray with you.

"Mistakes were made." A look of regret slipped across the Wilder's face, then vanished just as quickly, as if he realised how inappropriate his insincerity was. "I was away when he was taken, and only returned this morning. Had I been here, the confrontation would have been handled better. But Rissad, too, neglected to inform the Four Knot he was in Vessit. The laws exist for a reason."
Graham outlines a number of dystopian scenarios here, including one in which "swarms of tiny, armed drones, equipped with advanced sensors and communicating with each other, will thus be deployed to loiter permanently above the streets, deserts, and highways" of cities around the world, moving us toward a future where "militarized techniques of tracking and targeting must permanently colonize the city landscape and the spaces of everyday life."
With a beginning like that, I KNEW I was going to love The Springsweet, and I did definitely adore this novel. As Zora flees Baltimore, and the reminder of the tragedies her family has suffered, she starts anew in the untamed West, and under Saundra Mitchell's pen, Oklahoma comes alive, a hot, dry, hard place that Zora nevertheless finds something elusive in: hope, and a rebirth of sorts when she discovers her ability to locate water underground, becoming a "springsweet." This touch of the paranormal was very well-done, and flowed nicely with the rest of the story. I immediately felt for Zora, who is Understandably broken and grieving, and fell for her all over again, for the spirit buried underneath her mourning. Zora was changed vastly from the first book, but she still impressed me throughout The Springsweet with her heart and her ferocity.

The entire trip was a dream come true from beginning to end, meeting lovely, talented, warm friends, spending time with like minded women, laughing, making art, eating, sight seeing, shopping..sigh...re-entry was difficult. Much more difficult than I expected it to be.

Of course, that was intended to be a way for government authorities to keep the population in check. It was meant to give companies an advantage over their customers. It was supposed to swing the information balance in the favour of those that were gathering and correlating all that data. We were warned that we should be very careful about what we say in a blog, on facebook or in our linkedin profiles. We needed to be careful to present an acceptable face at all times, even when walking about in the High Street, under the watchful gaze of who knows how many closed circuit surveillance cameras.

Aseem Trivedi and Alok Dixit from Save Your Voice are continuing with the fourth day of their hunger strike to support annulment motion against IT Rules-2011in the Rajya Sabha. Ongoing from the 2nd of May, they will carry on with their hunger strike until any satisfactory response from the government is received regarding the opposition of the annulment of IT Rules-2011. Today they were visited by Arvind Gaur, Director of Asmita Theatre (New Delhi) and a few of his associates. Arvind, who is known for his work in innovative socially and politically relevant theatre, has given his word that he will extend his support for the fight for Freedom of Speech & Expression in a full fledged manner. He is also against the implementation of the IT Act and says that internet should be provided ‘free’ and not brought under any rules. The activists were grateful for his encouraging visit.

Nowadays researchers at 3M still take lots of breaks. They play pinball or lie on couches or take strolls across the campus and enjoy the grazing deer. Needless to say a scientist wanted to know why this worked, this time a psychologist, Joydeep Bhattacharya. He has a long-time interest in aha moments as you can see from this article in The Wall Street Journal entitled 'A Wandering Mind Heads Straight Towards Insight'. An excerpt:

When we moved into this house a little over a year ago we discovered that the space in the laundry room for the washer and dryer wasn't wide enough to hold a standard size side-by-side washer and dryer. Rather than buying something when our appliances were working fine, we just left the washer pulled out into the room. This made it inconvenient to move around and gave the room a cramped feeling.
So, I know I need to pamper my self a little more then I have been, now I am going to search out a good natural mask recipe, salt scrub; all that good stuff. I will have a little spa experience in my bathroom this week. I'll report back on that one, but let me know if you know of any good recipes, Ok?
“Rations will continue to be supplied until, depending on the Commissioner Western’s advice and recommendations and that will also come from the Ministry of Agriculture on how long the population is to be provided with rations until they’re able to feed themselves.”

Most late-night writings staffs still employ no or very few women (and Lynn Harris’ January Slate piece is a must-read dissection of that situation). “The Daily Show” recently hired two women for its writing staff, but as Melissa Silverstein pointed out on the Women and Hollywood blog, now the percentage of writers at that show is 11.7 percent, as opposed to zero.
And scene.
See that one at the bottom? All my income from these (seven) books will come from royalties, ALCS and PLR. If a school can make any number of copies of the book without paying a license to ALCS there will be no royalties - because why would they buy them if they can use them for free? These books with zero advance have taken the best part of eight months to write. Would YOU (non-writers) work for eight months, to be paid up to 18 months later? And how would you feel if the government then legislated away a portion of your income by saying people can steal it?

Here in Wisconsin, the spring turkey season lasts from early April through late May, but an individual permit is for one designated week (Wednesday to Tuesday) in one designated Zone (1-7). I had Period B, Zone 5, which put me in northeast Wisconsin in the third week in April. Applying for that season (applications are due in December) can be a bit dicey – we often have snow on the ground or falling from the sky that time of year up here – but it’s also a beautiful time to be out in the woods. Plus, a lot of people don’t like being cold so there’s a better chance of getting that week, and since I had never applied for a permit before I wanted to improve my odds. I don’t like being cold, either, of course, but I have plenty of cool weather clothing!
I have never in my life run a mile. Not a single mile. Maybe not even a half mile. Not once. I used to raise my eyebrow and keep walking the track when my high school gym teacher would urge me to run that mile. I don't like to run, I never have.
The CDC tried to look at the excuses given by parents as to why they won't allow them their children to walk. The CDC though that a decrease in the number of schools, by about 1,000 nationally, might explain some of it. But, the change in school amounted to a decline of just a couple of percentage points. And the CDC found that "active transport to school has also significantly declined among children who still live than 1 or 2 miles from school." Even, when you compare only those living near the school, walking to school steeply dropped.

This piece is called Worlds Apart for a couple of different reasons. The obvious is that the focal resembles a globe. Being in purple and green it represents passion and growth, two feelings I really experienced in the process of finding a new home and moving. The other reason Worlds Apart fits this piece so perfectly has to do with the timing of it's design.

Well, four episodes into The Legend of Korra, and I can pretty confidently state that it doesn’t only live up to the standard, it may actually exceed it. The Legend of Korra is a beautiful, intriguing series which firmly stands on its own while referencing the greater framework of the Avatar universe. There’s plenty in it to reward old fans, but it’s accessible enough for new viewers to jump on.

Nifong and his advisors (the “Troika” of Wilson, wife Cy Gurney, and citizens’ committee co-chair Victoria Peterson) apparently thought the new version represented a clever way of minimizing the significance of the withheld DNA evidence.

But that still doesn’t change the fact that I hate cancer. Because of cancer a father had to say goodbye to his son, kids had to say goodbye to their dad, and I and many others had to say goodbye to yet another friend. So go to hell where you belong, Cancer. You might have got your pound of flesh, but Ralph got a ton of life—eternal life. And because God wants to spend eternity with His children, cancer loses, God’s children win, and our good-byes are just for now.
Which is probably a good thing. Those flagship brands will keep breweries alive till the hops and malt thing either sorts out or we get used to it. In the end, I think this is going to be a time of opportunity for American brewers large and small.

Anyway, I spent the afternoon,
The night ended with the cold realization that chances are I'll be the only one here when Bunnie has puppies. That was sobering. I read the chapter on whelping in Tish's Aussie book and, while it is likely the pups will slide out and Bunnie will handle it all, some of the complications are downright scary. If things go wrong I could be doing everything from reaching a finger in to unhook a leg to giving the slimy things mouth to mouth (gently though - or I could explode it's tiny lungs!). All this is going to happen in the next couple of days! Hey-Suess Marimba.
Anyway, my husband said one day, as he was getting Estrella ready to go to school, "She needs a scarf, could you make her one?" I was in the middle of some other knitting projects, but my husband asked me so many times that I decided to make one right away instead of waiting until I was done with my other project. It only took a weekend to make and when I was done, he said: " I think it needs some tassels."
Even if there was something totally wrong with me and therefore that scared guys off being in a relationship with me, I wouldn’t go and ADMIT that to the guy asking! So therefore the question is a waste of time. I don’t even know how to answer when someone asks me!!

I'm writing this review after reading the third book in the series, The Reawakened, so my review is probably a little different than it would have been otherwise. I do think this is an AWESOME segue into the third book. By the time you finish reading Voice of Crow you will more than likely have fallen in love with all of the characters. That will only make the third book that more heart wrenching. And I promise, that one will take you on an emotional roller coaster. I did enjoy Voice of Crow and would recommend it to everyone.

The next evening, we were at a loss for places to eat: Con Son, the main island, is pretty small, and we weren't really keen on having dinner at one of the three government-owned hotels. Our snorkeling guide (is this starting to seem less like a Survivor experience than it should?) actually recommended the restaurant at our hotel. Funny thing is, we didn't know there was an actual restaurant as the place was made up of bungalows and a center platform where we had breakfast. Anyhow, much the adventurers that we are, we tried the hotel restaurant--and what a great surprise it was!

Topic of the discussion: Something you have to do before you die
My mom is really good at a lot of things: Cooking, knitting, weaving, throwing a party...the list goes on. There are some things she isn't so good at (believe it or not), most notably, baking (and sewing but that's for another post). We knew we were in for some great meals when we arrived from Oakland to visit for the holidays. I had some legitimate concerns that Parker would never want to eat my cooking again and grammy may have to ship meals from MA. Mom asked if I could make something for dessert for Christmas/Hanukkah dinner. I actually like to bake and am not the best cook, so we make a good team. I asked around to see what everyone felt like. Grandpa food was quick to chime in: he wanted cheesecake. My husband Tim confirmed this was the only choice. I've been on a caramel kick this season and I'd been wanting to make a recipe I saw on pinterest from The Modern Apron for Salted Caramel Cheesecake. It was just as glorious as it sounds.

The book was all I could hope for and more. There is something about the Warden's writing that keeps me glued to the page no matter what is going on around me. Plus, not only did Tohr's heart heal, we saw a lot of John Matthew and Xhex. The Band of Bastards played a role too - and now I wonder, who will Layla's HEA be? Throe or Xcor? Before she announced it on FB, I knew the next book would be Blay and Qhuinn's. Thank goodness! It's about time they were able to find true happiness. And I got my Wrath fix as well, although I was quite nervous during the van ride back to the mansion.
Yippy!!!!!! I hope you find this as exciting as I do!!!!
No matter what troubles Republicans are fighting through now, Obama needs young people to be excited about his re-election.
What do all these reactions have in common? They're knee-jerk and not entirely reasonable. If you act on any of them right away you will regret it. Dive straight into the manuscript to 'fix' an issue by slapping on the first idea you have like a sticking plaster, and you may mess things up worse than they were. Try to fudge an issue so that you won't have to deal with it, and you definitely will mess things up. And writing an angry email or making an angry phonecall to your editor to tell them how very wrong they are and ask why they're publishing the book if they hate it so much is such a d*ck move that I shouldn't even have to explain why you'll regret it.
A posting by PM Lee this morning comparing Germany to Singapore brought a torrent of criticisms from Singaporeans who pointed out that the comparison is inappropriate.

My first week of PR work went great. I stayed very busy learning all kinds of things. Since a lot of our clients are in the Oil and Gas industry, I get to learn about fun things such as: fracking, mud logging, TriAx products, etc. INSERT BIG QUESTION MARK. I will learn though. Good thing I have Jesse to help me on some of these terms.

I think most people who have this attitude think they're being optimists. I personally am a huge optimist, at least on good days, and I think positive thinking is incredibly powerful. But optimism does not grant superpowers. Life is good, but sometimes it isn't. People die, jobs are lost, natural disasters come, marriages end, haters beat you down with their -isms and phobias. A positive attitude, a joyful outlook on life, and a network of true friends are all things that will help to catch you when you fall, and that is an incredibly important thing to have. What they can't do, though, is allow you to bend the laws of gravity. Sometimes life pushes us down, and we fall.

It’s a conundrum and an arresting one at that. For a series based around the central conceit of time travel, Dr Who (particularly this new iteration) plays its cards surprising close to its chest where matters of temporal chronology are concerned. RTD OBE would rather tell a good story than get bogged down in the geeky nuts and bolts of it and more power to him if that’s how he feels. However, I’m a Dr Who fan, dammit, and for a lot of us the geeky nuts and bolts are not beside the point, rather they are the point. No, perhaps that’s overstating it slightly but they are an integral part of the tissue of rarified pleasures that make up the dna of the show. So, with that in mind, and with every intention of arriving at an answer to Andrew’s query at some point down the line, it is my great pleasure to present:

Rest in peace, Ms. Neal.
Then there have been some medical issues. No one, but Daniel, my parents, his parents and a few close family members know about this, until now. About three weeks ago, I discovered a bump under my skin on my neck. I didn't think anything of it, until the bump grew. Even then I didn't think it was anything. I casually mentioned it to Daniel and he insisted I go to the doctor. I went to the doctor, he said it was a swollen lymph node which isn't uncommon. He prescribed an antibiotic and said if things didn't get better to come back. I took the course of antibiotics and the lymph node grew. On Monday I went back to the doctor. The instant he felt it, he told me I needed to go in for an ultrasound that day. Daniel went with me to the ultrasound and after the ultrasound, a radiologist came out to talk to us. He explained that I had two lymph nodes that were on the large side and he wanted to perform a cat scan to make sure that I didn't have any other enlarged lymph nodes.
This post turned into an essay on a variety of women’s issues in Egypt. Considering the dominance of the subject across the project, I should explain that I have been close to issues of violence against women through my 9-year employment with a domestic violence agency.

Let's start with value: it's simply the best offer around. But in that offer comes two possible inverters, made by two different companies (one Asian and one Australian). I've done my research and the Asian made inverter has a reputation for breaking down. The Australian inverter does not. I discovered later (after more research) the man I was talking to was only a sales person, not the accredited solar installer that would have to design the placing of the panels on our roof, and what pieces of equipment were required. He informed me, they may need extra things that didn't end up being quoted in the price.

As a parent you put so much into these activities but you also get a lot out of the involvement. I can imagine that there is a great sense of loss when your children don’t need you to hold their hands anymore and there is no ‘we’ just Dad and Mum with empty Saturday and Sunday mornings to be filled or not filled.

The key to this is to make the ‘transition’ stage of the group a continuing and seamless cycle; one that perpetuates through the balance of signings and youth development. To me that is the balance that the current squad has – and to a very large extent, I exclude those who are out on loan since for the most part, I do not expect them to play for Arsenal again. It is the process that will underpin his desire for a trophy that recognises the ‘depth‘ of the squad as the manager liked to call it.
"The story for this painting was seeded years ago. Shortly before moving on my property I decided to clean up this field of weeds across the road. After the purchase of a five hundered dollar John Deere, I talked my Daddy into letting me borrow his bush-hawg and the deed was done. I was proud of the results and was willing to bet my neighbors would feel the same.

Day 11 - one of my husband's favorites! Tim showed us how to use shrink plastic then dip it into UTEE in the Melting Pot for a neat look of thick, aged glass. Since I had cut out the Carved Ornaments I decided to not let the second go to waste. As I mentioned on my Tim version, I don't have a melting pot but just kept pouncing embossing ink and UTEE over the ornament until I was happy with the results.

But first we had to visit another iconic US concept – the mall. The US managed to perfect and export consumerism as exemplified in the mall. But now others have taken the idea and run with it – so an Australian company seems to own half the malls around the world. We stopped in at a major mall on the outskirts of San Francisco with one goal in mind – the Lego store. An entire shop devoted to Lego is, without doubt, a thing of true beauty. And the Lego shop sits opposite the Apple store, so I got to look at toys too. The boys came away with a deeper appreciation of the Lego range and a kit each (I did not come away with anything Apple). But that was far from the whole geeky Lego experience for the day.
The aesthetics of the restaurant have all been carefully considered. Outside in the dining room, the tables are all covered with ostrich leather. Our bread plates and the bowls for salt have been designed by Blue Mountains ceramicist Simon Reece who uses inspiration from nature to create his works. His recent collection included an Iced Earth series, and the salt bowls make us think of profiteroles, biscuits or honeycomb covered in chocolate.

James must have one amazing sense of humor. I found myself in fits of giggles at some of the jokes and emails she had in the book. (My husband thought I was going bonkers) My favourite- SHOUTY CAPITALS. I recently read somewhere that James claims she's really not that good of a writer. Well let me tell you this E.L James, I don't care what you say, I thought it was amazing, sensual, funny, meaningful, exotic, intense and just plain and simply ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!
After reading about her daily cleaning regime, my bi-weekly dust seemed to pale into insignificance, and somehow that spurred me on.

Race time was approaching and I edged my way up toward the front of the corral, the race began and I had to manoeuvre my way out of the crowd. It took a bit of a sprint to do so, but it was worth the effort, especially since by the time I was able to separate a bit the route was on the sidewalk over the bridge.
Judging by the response of the Egyptian government, you'd think the National Association for Change was planning a full-scale insurgency.
Very crisp; the bitterness of the quinine really made itself known in this cocktail. There was also a touch of Violette towards the end. It’s rare that I think of colours when tasting drinks, but this one reminded me of purple and black. It was an intense Martini with an intriguing contrast between sweet floral and earthy bitter flavours.

So this year's tree is filled with apples, pears, and lemons - with little woodland creatures and bird's nests throughout the branches. I also filled the interior of the tree with dogwood branches, bleached eucalyptus, dried gourd and mushrooms.

Jump. That is what P.K. has done. A totally wild, crazy jump from a restrictive life with her family into a life of total adventure—rock-climbing out west with a guy she barely knows. At first, everything’s amazing. Not only are they climbing in awesomely beautiful national parks like Yosemite but they seem awesomely made for one another. P.K. is in heaven. And then the cops show up . . . with an arrest warrant. And P.K. has to decide who to believe: this amazing guy whom she trusts with her life—or the cops, who want her to believe that he may take her life.
Peace and Love,

I thought Yves was a fantastic clinician and would recommend him to anyone. He didn't have a single negative thing to say all weekend, yet was able to get riders out of their comfort zones and doing things they didn't think they could do. He really liked Jasper and said he would take him home to his barn. He said he's athletic, ratable, and has a tidy jump. Serena heard him say he thought he could go far. I had a few lightbulb moments about waiting before the jump (I need a scarecrow in the middle of the arena with a recording that plays, "wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait"), and what keeping leg on before a jump actually means.

Every morning before I punched the time clock I would spend half an hour or so meditating on Scripture and praying. My most common prayer was that God would open a door, make a way that I might proclaim Christ to as many folks as I could at the retirement community. I was desperate for God to give me this chance.

"Pub rock, the English roots rock movement of the early '70s, would never have earned a cult following if it wasn't for Brinsley Schwarz. Initially, Brinsley Schwarz was a rambling, neo-psychedelic folk-rock band that borrowed heavily from Crosby, Stills & Nash and the Grateful Dead. Following a disastrous publicity stunt to promote its debut album, the band went into seclusion outside of London and developed a laid-back, rootsy sound inspired by Eggs Over Easy, an American band that had been playing a mixture of originals and covers in English pubs. Following their conversion to pub rock, the Brinsleys ditched their pretensions of stardom and became a down to earth, self-effacing rock & roll band. Between 1971 and 1974, Brinsley Schwarz toured England innumerable times, playing pubs across the country. Along the way, they established a circuit for similar bands like Dr. Feelgood and Ducks Deluxe to follow. Though the group was nominally guitarist Brinsley Schwarz's band, bassist/lead vocalist Nick Lowe provided the bulk of the group's songs. Lowe developed a distinctive songwriting voice -- conversational, melodic, offbeat, and funny -- and the band was infused with his skewed sense of humor. Despite strong reviews and a dedicated fan base, the Brinsleys never managed to escape cult status, yet they influenced a legion of other artists, creating an underground, back-to-basics movement that laid the foundation for punk rock.
Though many veterinarians will allow your pet to be treated in your presence if you insist, please be aware that this makes everyone’s jobs more difficult, including your pet’s, so, keeping your pet’s health and the staff’s safety in mind, it is usually best to defer to the veterinarian’s wishes. If, for whatever reason, you feel that the staff treat your pet in a manner that is unprofessional, then change veterinarians.

Damn near anything could probably be worked into a coherent scenario with enough mangling of the text, if you’re willing to do some heavy-duty text-mangling to keep your belief system safe. If there was an additional mention of the event somewhere in Luke, say, which described Judas as being burned alive in a giant Wicker Man, then I have no doubt that someone, somewhere, would be claiming that this was a reference to some specific funereal tradition of the time, and that the word “alive” refers to the idea of the soul remaining in the body until this ritual releases it. Or possibly even something more plausible than the first crazy shit that sprung to my mind. If John claimed that Judas was eaten by velociraptors, then I would totally become a Christian and make this the basis of my entire belief system, and I would concoct as elaborate an explanatory scenario as was necessary to convince myself of its truth.

In regard to the issue of population growth, Balisacan argues that the government must “mainstream” population management in the government’s development agenda because rapid population growth in the country proves to be a potent obstruction to economic development.

Another day Scott and I took a day trip up to Lahaina to go snorkeling and explore the area. We snorkeled at Black Rock and saw amazing fish! Some of them glowed in the light. Alas, when we went back to the van we discovered that Scott had gone snorkeling with the car keys in his pocket. They happened to be electronic keys and so the chip inside was fried. There is only one guy on the island who can fix it. So, we had to wait for him to drive out to fix it and then pay his exhorbitant fee because we had no choice. Ggrrr.... lesson learned...don't buy a car with electronic keys!

I quickly glanced up, seeing something at the edge of my vision. A large familiar shape slowly rose from behind the cattails up ahead. Then in an instant I was blinded as the massive form pressed against my front side. It felt like a half minute went by, but in reality it was most likely five seconds or less. Forgetting to apply the brakes, my mind was more focused on the last glimpse of the road, and trying to keep the bike from going off it.

While I’m writing I try and seek out books that are somehow relevant to what I’m working on. For example, while writing Underground, which takes place in part on the Underground Railroad before the Civil War in the States, I sought out books about slavery and antebellum history.

Amazingly, using equipment that’s been largely “standard issue” (i.e. included in all newly manufactured heavy trucks and consequently no added cost) many commercial fleets could substantially reduce their crash rate (by 50% if the study’s methodology is accurate). However, many safety managers lament that their fleet will not use the devices. Many express that it’s critical to their productivity that drivers must be able to speed to “make up lost time” in urban areas where they sit in congestion and lose eligible work hours.
Reviewing a session beer is not as much fun as something a bit more exotic. Being what they are, a great deal of thought should not expended into the flavors or aromas on experiences; one just drinks and enjoys. A liquid companion to any number of tasks where two things can be done at once and our attention is on that other thing, not the liquid that compliments it.
To be PRESENT and fully engaged in life is the first step to finding joy. Empowerment begins in the present moment not the past or the future. We must learn to experience what is in front of us, even grief or pain. Because we tend to block those experiences, we manage our suffering instead of embracing it, as part of the experience of life.

In book #2 we learned more about life inside the silo and this book takes up where that one left off. We follow Juliette as she ascends from the deep pits of the silo, where she has been content to live her life taking care of the machines that allow the silo to survive. She is convinced to take a position as the new sheriff which is the beginning of a life changing journey for not only herself, but for possibly everyone who lives in the silo. As people start to die and revelations are made Juliette begins to question her very existence and what she has always been lead to believe. She makes shocking discoveries that lead her to the place that is most feared in the silo, the outside world.
We are very aware, Dragonstar and I, that we live differently from pretty much everyone in our immediate proximity. It's made obvious to us every time we spend time among conventionally-parenting, conventionally-schooling families. We can get along, but we have a hard time finding meaningful common ground. We feel weird and discordant. Out of sync.

On March 28, Georgetown University participated in a full-scale mass dispensing exercise in conjunction with the District of Columbia Department of Health (DOH). The exercise, named “2012 National Capital Region Extended Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) Mass Dispensing Exercise,” allowed the District and surrounding regions (Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia) to assess the District’s capacity to respond to a bio-terrorism and/or disease outbreak event.
We had a good start on time. We started just below "Tantalus"(Express 37), but soon pulled ahead into clear air. We tacked back toward the east and tacked up that shore to to look for current relief from the still flooding current. We had good speed and pulled away from the rest of our class and started passing the previous two classes. We crossed back to the west and started lining up our approach to the area between Pt White and Illahee. This zone has some strange currents to contend with. We took some long tacks up Port Orchard before we started working up the Bainbridge Island shore. There was a narrow band of wind from Fletcher Bay to Battle Point, farther to the west, the wind was very light.
Thus the stream of women with toddling infants, or babes in arms, perhaps most of them soon to be widowed, filed up from the cabins and over the side and away, to life. The men — by far the greater part of them — remained to die, millionaire and peasant and man of middle class alike, bravely, it must have been, sharing each other's fate and going down to a common grave.
The one good thing about this park is that the rides are specifically for small children. Trevor was able to ride his first roller coaster - Coastersaurus. We couldn't believe that he was big enough but we went with it. He thought he was a big boy. He didn't care for it so much during the ride, but as soon as he heard his big brother say he liked it then Trevor said the same thing. However, he didn't ride it again that day.

I did some cyber-sleuthing last summer and managed to dig up Vasquez’s email address. His attitude might best be summarized by what he wrote me in an email: “shows, eh, nothin really planned out. not really aggressive about that kinda stuff, so we dont really play out much.” His small but dedicated group of fans hails him as an underground artist, and he is in the sense that he’s never been on a major label, never played outside the West Coast, and he drew many of his own record sleeves. But if he’s underground in the cool, respectable, punk rock sense of the term, it’s not because mainstream America has continually ignored his advances. He’s underground because he doesn’t make his music or himself that available. In our era of social-networking and transparent self-promotion, most people know that audiences don’t come to you. You have to get music into people’s hands, play out and blanket the web to let them know you exist. This is particularly regrettable since Nice Smile songs such as “My World,” “Dark Thud” and “The Show,” as with much of Vasquez’s previous music, are too powerful to let wallow away on some Myspace page’s embedded player, unavailable for purchase. It’s not like people aren’t interested.
We are not children padding our flimsy essays with adjectives and adverbs. We are adults who know that the number of words in a story mean nothing; it’s only what the words mean that counts. And in description, those words must count twice: to give us a feel for the setting, and to give us a feel for the character.

Dressel’s Pub (419 N Euclid Ave) If you’re looking for a true pub in St. Louis, look no further than Dressel’s. One of the few places that regularly serves cask beer, the beer list is always top notch. It’s dark and cozy interior makes for a great spot to bring a book and grab a pint.

"The magical planet of Discworld is supported by four massive elephants who stand on the back of the Great A'Tuin, a giant turtle swimming slowly through the mysterious interstellar gulf. Its very existence is about to be threatened by a strange new blight: the arrival of the first tourist, upon whose survival rests the peace and prosperity of the land." I've made many repeated attempts to read Terry Pratchett's novels, not least because they are incredibly popular, but more importantly, people I regard highly think they are great. Until now I hadn't managed to finish a single one. For me, it seems, they have to be read out loud, because this time I enjoyed the story immensely, even though it was pretty silly. And it ended on a cliffhanger - would those who are already familiar with the books tell me: will I find out what happens to Rincewind in the next book? Will it be worth it?
Vile. Abominable. Abode of every evil and vice. Indeed, what woman could feel anything but “most unfortunate” when convinced of her sorry state of existence before the perfection that is held up as man? The querelle des femmes, and later the witchcraze, feature in the great debate about the nature of a woman: is she good (like Mary) or is she bad (like Eve)?

What is gained by this rigid assumed division of gender tastes? One of the contributors on Woman's Hours - Claire Leigh, I think - asked why not group books under genre: Romance; Historical fiction etc as is done with Crime/Thrillers, Horror or SF/Fantasy. A very sensible suggestion I thought.

I was cooped up in a conference room for 3 days and by the time we were let out, it was almost dinner time. I was a naughty girl and skipped the last two workshops on day 2 just to get some fresh air. Took the tram down to the Old Town which is located at lake Zürich.

I contacted Warmoth and they said they could see what they could do. Well, they worked their magic with the CNC machines to reroute the hole for the Wilkinson in the right place on the body (and routed out the slot for the LSR rollernut on the neck). If you look carefully, you can see the exposed wood in the slot that used to be painted black. It worked out beautifully (but ignore the very bad, very ugly filling I did of the original 6 screw holes)!

So, there was a test for the parents to take to see which conscience we operate in. Before I took the test, I KNEW!! I had no doubt I operate in the prohibitive conscience. It's not necessarily a guilty conscience, but there is always potential for guilt. I am always thinking ahead to what could or would or might happen. Always having the fear that I will disappoint someone. Never being confident in my decisions because someone may disagree. Always worrying I will be misunderstood.

If anyone lived for Christ, it was the Apostle Paul. He endured many trials and suffered greatly in order to further the Gospel. Paul did end up dying for the Lord, but by his living for the Lord, his life was “poured out as a drink offering” (2 Tim 4:6). If you are living for the Lord, then you will be giving your life away and living sacrificially for others and not for yourself.

Korea is a single nation that was forcibly divided by the United States immediately after World War II. To this day, the DPRK remains committed to reunification. After 35 years of horrifying treatment by Japanese colonizers, the Korean people’s brief hope for a single, unified Korea was dashed when the Truman administration launched a military campaign to violently suppress the Korean revolution. Aided by the Soviet Union and socialist China, the Korean People’s Army (KPA), led by Kim Il-Sung, pushed the U.S led invasion back to the 38th parallel, now the southern border of the DPRK.

In Western Civilization, our societies have devolved, thanks to "progressive" politics, to a self-consuming, self-destructing mob. Ruin is inevitable. This is not what the Founding Fathers intended. They did not intend to establish a mobocracy, but a Constitutional Republic, wherein the rights and property of the individual were protected against the caprice of the mob, where even the majority is limited in what it can do.

“What’s your story, sunshine, haven’t seen you around here before”, he said. She lost her words, and downed the contents of her glass, hoping for some liquid courage. She came up almost choking on the taste, but managed to hold it down. As it burned fire in her belly, she could finally speak. She leaned forward, and put her hand on his vest. “I came here for you”, she said.
A book by the man who coined the termed “vehicular cycling” is set to be re-published by MIT Press on May 18th (which is Bike to Work Day). In 1993, John Forester’s Effective Cycling aimed to explain his perspective on how people should operate bicycles. That book, and Forester himself, had a profound impact on cycling in the 1990s and the new edition of the book will hit shelves as cities across America clamor to install the type of separated, protected bike infrastructure Forester abhors.

That said, there are a lot of physical places I knew growing up here as a child that no longer exist. The loss of some make me sad and make San Francisco a significantly poorer place, in my opinion. We’re not, in the great scheme of things, a very old place. We don’t have bottomless stores of architectural beauty and history. We should appreciate and preserve the important things we have.
This “walking,” this περιπατεῖτε is the present, indicative, active form of the verb περιπατέω, which, in this context, is speaking of ‘walking concerning something.’ It is describing a certain way in which a Christian walks through each day. It has to do with relationships and how he or she responds and reacts both outwardly and inwardly to all of life’s circumstances. Paul tells us to do this ἀκριβῶς or akribōs. I translated this as “circumspectly” and the ESV as “carefully.” The idea is to walk through this life looking all around, being on the lookout. The word ἀκριβῶς can also be translated as “accurate, which speaks of precision, diligence, accuracy, and exactness. Those are very important things in how I do my job as a DBA, but in our walk as Christians it also applies in our diligence to hold to the things of the Lord. Think of those preachers of God’s Word who hold firm and never waiver. They are diligent. Now think of those who do the very opposite as they waiver all over the place desperately seeking to be culturally relevant.

I was blown away by The Dark Knight, it took me completely off guard. I was not expecting as great of a film as it turned out to be. So The Dark Knight Rises has a difficult task of beating out that incredible sequel. The problem I have is that they aren’t giving me enough to get excited off of other than it is a sequel to The Dark Knight. The trailers didn’t impress me and the pictures released had the same effect. I am really worried by what is taking place here. Primarily because Catwoman is in this movie and I despise Catwoman. I hate her character. I find her annoying and bothersome. Also that shot in the trailer with the exploding football field was so stupid. That guy really didn’t feel the explosion. It just didn’t fit in this world Christopher Nolan has created because the scene played as a joke by having the man run for a touchdown and after succeeding notice the stadium was destroyed. I do however, love the look of Bane. Tom Hardy is a fine actor so I know he will perform with this role. There is no way he will be able to beat out Heath Ledger’s terrific take on The Joker but he will still be good. I am placing my trust in Nolan’s hands to pull this off. It won’t be as great as The Dark Knight but it will still be a good movie.

Breach, a fast-paced movie directed by Billy Ray, attempts to answer some of these perplexing questions. The movie covers only the last six weeks of Hanssen’s two-decade-long espionage career, opening in the late fall of 2000, when Hanssen first came under the investigative microscope. According to David Wise, author of one of the best of several accounts of Hanssen’s life and perfidy, a successful joint CIA-FBI initiative obtained a package containing a portion of an operational file pertaining to a mole deeply embedded in the US counterintelligence community. [2] In addition to the file, the package contained three other exceptional pieces of evidence: an audio tape containing two brief telephone conversations between the mole and a KGB interlocutor in 1986, copies of letters written by the mole during 1985–88, and two partial fingerprints lifted from a plastic garbage bag the mole had used to wrap a delivery to Moscow. Wise wrote that the purchase price of the package was $7 million.

I'm much more exercised by today's poser, which is to calculate the odds of babies being born at a particular time on a particular date so that they have a sequence of the same number. Supposing a child had been born at 20.02hr. on 20.02 in 2002. A woman lucky enough to have already had a baby at that exact time and date might like to try for her next to be born at 21.12hr. on 21.12.2112. Plenty of time to practice.

I remember when I was little and my sister and I would scout out the house for presents. There was a big chest in my parents' bedroom and we meticulously looked at how everything was arrayed on top of it (including a perfectly parted tassel) and then delved into it, discovering all of our presents. We then carefully put everything back, even parting that tassel in the exact same place, and my parents never knew until I told them years later. I will be strong, I will be strong...

Porters came to be in 1722 (or'30--sources vary) when London brewer Ralph Harwood introduced a mixture of three beers common at the time. He called the resulting brew "entire" or "entire butt" (butt being an olden days word for "barrel"). Porters from the nearby produce market are purported to have liked it, hence the name. (Jackson disputes this.) As for names, I wonder if Deschutes' decision to name their porter after Central Oregon's Black Butte wasn't a nod to Harwood's "entire butt." Someday I'll ask someone.

I plan on sharing the details and photos with you probably tomorrow or the beginning of next week. In the mean time I wanted to show you the other pillow case dresses I managed to get done.

Step 4: The hardest part about this particular chair were these buttons. I bought hardware called Cover Button Refill. This allowed me to use the same fabric as the rest of the chair for my buttons. The hard part was putting the buttons on the chair. It would have been nice to have a super extra long needle with a very wide eye to string these buttons on, but we didn't have one and I don't even know if they exist, so we got creative. We used a long skinny screwdriver to stab through the thick chair. We then taped the button parts onto the screwdriver and pulled it back through to the back of the chair and into place. Hard work! If there is an easier way, I would love to know.

Sunday I also went to Bajo del Tigre in order to take background pictures for signs 1 and 4 which I made on the computer using powerpoint. I have had the amazing help throughout the project of those two signs from someone in Seattle who donated his photos to the MCL for their use. He altered the pictures and everything for me. It is quite the wonder going abroad to realize how small the world is when you run into people that live in the same town or area. His son even just graduated out of Fairhaven College at Western in my hometown of Bellingham. During my walk I got to see a mot mot and also several goatis! I was one of the few people in the group I think that hadn’t seen one yet, so I was super excited. Unfortunately they move super quick and I was unable to get a picture of any of them. But the trip to Bajo del Tigre (for where I am designing the signs etc.) was great even if I got absolutely SOAKED.

I, myself, am still relentlessly working on my frozen shoulders and sore feet, which never seem to budge no matter what I do.

Eddie did find a buyer for “Kevin.” It was somewhat miraculous in that the buyer was willing to pay a good price for the pig, which meant Jess actually made a nice profit. Makes me think of the “all things work together for good” verse!

And Bush's mention in his speech of moral convictions contrasts sharply, of course, with the "postmodern" Leftist mockery of all morality, tradition and guiding values. I am reminded in that connection of one of Stalin's famous sayings when someone mentioned the Vatican's opposition to him. As a good Leftist, Stalin's answer was of course in terms of power rather than in terms of any principles or morality. He said: "And how many divisions does the Pope have?". The Pope of course had no army at all, only Christian morality and values. But who had the last laugh? Stalin's Soviet creation ended up, as Ronald Reagan predicted, on the ash heap of history and it was a Polish Pope and his Catholic flock in Poland who were instrumental in finally pushing over that tottering and rotten edifice. And the authority of the Pope and the life of his church still continue worldwide. Morality trumped brute force. The Leftist contempt for moral values serves no-one well -- not even Leftists themselves. I treat the Leftist approach to morality at greater length elsewhere

Miss Nozomi Sasaki has been the only Japanese woman to be nominated on the celebrity list, which has been voted on internet by international audience. She ranked as the 33th place.
At first I became very sad and wondered how it could possibly be that we live in a world where such things happen, where people cap cop such attitudes. Why doesn’t somebody do something? Why don’t people see how wrong they are? Why are these mistakes made over and over?
Block #12........I finished this one today!!
If you're like me, your love of the macabre started early. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when I turned to the dark side, but one thing certainly brought the ghastly home: Madballs.
After some tense finger pointing and general hysteria, the cops finally concede they can't determine who the alien is, and since no laws were broken, everyone is free to leave.

"I’d always wanted to write novels, and can’t recall how many exercise books I bought as a child, computers not having yet been invented. I’d start grandly with Chapter 1, and then run out of steam by the second or third page. As an adult I found the same problem. I’d spend a long time trying to plan a novel, and then just get bored with the whole thing before I’d even started. But one day this all changed. I had a transformational encounter with a great golden hare in some woods. I felt different afterwards. Then a while later I had another very deep experience at sunrise on the morning of Samhain in a labyrinth made of fallen autumn leaves. I knew then with absolute certainty that I would write, and that what I wrote would be successful."
APPROXIMATE TIME: 7am- 7pm
Let me elaborate on these subjects.
Maybe there are just as many bullies who could see a real family, truly affected by the death of a kid who was mercilessly bullied. Maybe just one or two of them will realize that telling a kid they should be dead isn’t the best way to conduct themselves.
All the back and forth about who won the “debate” aside, just think about this for a second: One of these two is an Ivy League university professor and Nobel Laureate; the other is a medical doctor by profession, who’s been a standing member of congress for almost thirty years of his life, and is a self-taught, amateur economist. The fact that anyone is arguing over who did better is a testament to how much a lightweight Krugman is, and how formidable Paul is, in this field.

Unfortunately, this whole plot line just seemed like nails dragged against a chalkboard for me. Putting aside the fact that the only business woman is a seductress, I just don’t particularly like seeing serious problems like date drugs portrayed like this. It just felt like a joke to me, down playing something that’s a sensitive issue. Then add the seductress business woman element to it and we’ve officially crashed and burned. In the end, I was disappointed with the subplot of Princess Jellyfish.

Instead, we stare blankly at our terminals, getting up only occasionally to shuffle about the facility in a zombie-like state.
This aspect of decentralization is especially important for women. Social change happens in small increments, one department at a time, one hire at a time. We’ve all heard the story of how David Hilbert convinced the Gottingen mathematics department to hire Emmy Noether. Well, if he’d had to run a Europe-wide referendum on that, chances are that Noether would have never had a paid university position in Germany.
For now, I’m enjoying the mischievous milkoholic Ryu Ki Woo and devilish Simon D having their fun at the gullible and cash-strapped So Min. As the story moves ahead, I do wish she’ll grow out of being naive, but maybe it’s that kind of innocence that will lead Ki Woo to grow feelings for her?

But as I have pointed out there was an escape clause, like in every law, as the proffie should now, seeing that he considers himself an expert.
For days I practiced handing my stress over, my pain, my anger, not just at this particular experience, but with everything. I have been practicing it ever since – and I have felt profound shifts, whenever I remember to use it, Prunella et al make me forget regularly, but they can’t make me forget this experience. It has made me more present and far more aware.
Accusation: "For too long the blacks had been de-humanised & were starting to rise up for equal rights."
When this is put alongside the fact that there is a raft of current, legal, policies against this type of development in the strategic gap and on public open space, it is clear that the majority of people DO NOT WANT this development in it’s current form.

6.) An established tradition has a body of clergy, so if you don’t like one priest or priestess, but like the tradition, there are others out there. There are several priestess in Blue Star that I don’t want to work with for personal reasons, but that’s OK, I’m not stuck with them because there are many more out there.

While that redefinition came out of Steiner’s own visionary experiences, he was following the lead of one of the towering minds of the Western tradition, the ancient Greek polymath Aristotle. In the Nicomachean Ethics, arguably the most influential work on the philosophy of ethics ever penned, Aristotle argued that any given virtue was not the opposite of one vice but the midpoint between two. Courage, he pointed out, was opposed to cowardice, but it was equally opposed to the sort of rash stupidity that ignores the existence of danger; real generosity is no more compatible with greed than with spendthrift wastefulness, and so on through the catalog of the virtues. For most of two thousand years, Christian philosophers have coped uneasily with the mismatch between Aristotle’s ethical insights and the mythic imagery of their own faith; Steiner found what is certainly one of the more thoughtful ways through the tangle.
The Angel Court Girls have gone to the beach...
Eyes Like Leaves is a secondary world fantasy in a land similar to ancient Ireland. The wizard Tarn and his mentor Puretongue, who have the ability to change shape, are attempting to defend their land against the forces of the Icelord, who wishes to bring an endless winter. So far, Tarn has met up with Carrie, a young woman unaware of her own magical abilities, and the two of them have been hotly pursued by various "stormkin." Meanwhile, Puretongue and another young protégé travel by sea to meet them.

“Yes, exactly!” exclaimed the skipper. “Like a bloodhound.”
I will describe most of the rest of the day as I wrote it in my diary at the time. Though the description is quite long, it can also give a glimpse of what the time was like:
We drive into the island state and it rapidly becomes clear that things are different. The landscape seems to be a contradiction, both small and large at the same time. The land is folded, creased in intimate ways, with tiny patches and twists, but it is also filled with greater distance and larger size. While some roads are the ruler straight byways of the mainland, roads that seem to make no concession to the landscape, others are twisted and plastic. These roads flow through the landscape rather than just bisect it. These are roads that have been made with the landscape, the easiest way rather than the fastest way. Not for the last time I am reminded of England. Small roads. Patches of woodland. Steep sided valleys, tiny and almost hidden, with fast flowing streams. In places there are stone walls by the side of the road. But then the distance appears and the illusion of Englishness fades. The distant hills are fuzzy at the edges with trees. The paddock trees are huge, but straight, with leaves and branches growing in clumps. They have few low side branches. When these trees were young they were forest trees, and their form still shows this. They are the ghosts of a forest that has only recently been lost.

Well, my four month adventure in Europe is over. It must have been the fastest four months of my life...it feels like a dream. I've been back in the US for almost two weeks, but the reverse culture shock is killing me! When I first moved to England, I was able to slide right into the culture and the way of life so easily, there wasn't really an adjustment period for me. But coming back, I feel out of place. Like I have this big arrow above my head, pointing me out. I don't feel like I fade into the background anymore. Scary. That old cliche about always moving forward applies, I can't undo the four months I spent independently that made me a better, stronger, more out going person. So now I have to find a way to fit this new me inside Small Town, USA. And I'm afraid it isn't going to happen. I've always known I wasn't staying here, but now I feel like I'm suffocating. Still, I wouldn't trade a moment of those four months for anything, and I would go back in a heart beat.

In 1926, he accepted an offer from Hal Roach (producer of Harold Lloyd, “Our Gang”, Charley Chase, and many others) to direct and write shorts. He seemed quite content to be behind the camera, when one day an accident got him acting again. One of the Roach players named Oliver Hardy had scalded himself with gravy and Stan had to substitute for him.
Joss Whedon used a structuralism format using binary opposition to create conflict between two slayers in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The storylines of Buffy and Faith are completely opposite from each other. In Buffy’s life she has her mother and her sister (in later seasons), her friends that help her fight vampires, and her watcher. Faith doesn’t have any family or friends around her. She watched her watcher die. How both girls view power is very different Faith believes that she is above human laws while Buffy believes that slayers should follow human laws. Buffy’s power comes from the obligation of her duty of being a slayer. She wants to use her power to help people. Faith gets her power from anger and she wants to prove that she is worth something.
If you send much time online at all you’ve probably heard about the individuals who make money online taking surveys.

MORALS: Network executives and the media have no morals. They are duty-bound to air whatever programming garners the most ratings. This leads us in a predictable direction; Most futuristic cyberpunk science fiction shows incredibly brutal shows on television — a social commentary about television’s ultimate fate. But this movie doesn’t happen in the future; it happens in the present. And it happens in a pretty realistic way. Network executive backstabbing, FCC interference, media hype, emergency Supreme Court rulings, Freedom Of Speech issues, how to choose contestants that interest The People — everything is covered.

My first novel is title Into Fire. I wanted the titles to be along those same lines, so the trilogy fit together. Some type of preposition, and then one of the basic elements (which are part of the plot in my novel).
Anyway – while I attempt to try and control myself. (EEK!) Here’s a few that you can whet your taste buds with… although, this didn’t really help on the last shoe post, cuz I definitely copped those hot pink ones. I’M ONLY ONE WOMAN HERE GUYS!!! There’s only so much temptation I can endure!

As to his take on Elvira, it firstly shows how quickly she had become demonised. Remember, just one month previously a large crowd had greeted her acquittal with jubilation and a quick burst of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow”. Again, it is her lifestyle that is deplored, not whether she committed murder or not. I do wonder where Wodehouse picked up the authentic-sounding detail about “red pyjamas”. These would have been beach pyjamas, very much the thing in the South of France in the early thirties. Red then, as it does now, carried very definite overtones of sexual availibility.

Seriously, get a grip. Drink a fucking beer, jot down your thoughts and then go on with your life. Hell, if you told me that you were performing sexual acrobatics with a growler on two strippers then I might think you are some kind of world beater but I've seen the likes of you people and most of you are, more or less, glorified alcoholics with no pause button in reach of your proclivities. It's just a beer and this one will not make your pecker bigger or your tongue stand in salute but it will quench your thirst and fill your toilet with a straw colored rainbow just like any other glow in the dark secret special recipe from the Gods of nectar. Drink up and STFU.
With the decision to make wall scones in mind, I grabbed a sketch pad and started to draw some rough ideas for pieces I would like to create. I didn’t censor any ideas; I just drew whatever came to mind. The vast majority of sconces I saw used light bulbs to accent the piece, but I wanted to go in a different direction with my sconces. My wife loves candles, and I have really gained an appreciation for them as well. I like the soft glow they produce, and you don’t have to put the sconce anywhere near an electrical outlet or have cords running up and down your walls. Also, I just thought that candles would complement my rustic theme better.

Little Budda has now not been well for three weeks. He's teething badly - we have three very sharp little teeth - and he is full of a cold and has the amazing, non shifting conjunctivitis. I am a firm believer in the powers of breastmilk for curing all, but I admitted defeat this week and took him to the docs. He is on double the usual dose of eye drops - yes it really is that bad - and still the conjunctivitis stays.
Someone told me to take these back, and THANK GOD. As they said, if your baby gets used to always having perfectly warmed bottles and a perfectly warm wipe, what are you going to do when those aren't options? Carys taking room temperature wipes (well, since we cloth diaper, wipe spray) and bottles that are even a bit cool (we just take the cold edge off but don't try to get them warm) was a godsend.
Measure about 1-1/2 inches above the fused glass bead and make a square knot. Measure another 1-1/2 inches above the first knot and create a second square knot.
If the Chinese move in as intended, the whites in South Africa would be made redundant, because they would no longer be needed. If they could import two or three millions Chinese the SA whites would no longer be needed. It has been suggested that China wished to shift 300 million of their people to Africa. This was an idea proposed by Britain and it serves as proof that the NWO was behind this Chinese invasion and colonisation of Africa. The west also financed and supported Saddam Hussain, the Muslim Brotherhood, Syria, Iran and even Gadaffi at various stages, didn't they and it came back to bite them in the rear, didn't it? The naive British may have planted the idea in the minds of China, but thats where their role ended, the west does not control China and they never will.
The other characters were so much fun-- Galen was incredibly dreamy, and I was definitely rooting for him the entire time. I also liked that the book was split in half between Emma and Galen's POVs so we could see both their sides of the story. Galen's sister Rayna was a real spit-fire, who you hate at first but then come around to liking. She had me cracking up every time she rejected Toraf's romantic advances on her, and I couldn't believe how Toraf gets back at her for playing hard to get!
you are holy. What I want to talk about here though are those Christians who have gone before us who have taken the medicine of Christ and His Church religiously (pun intended). Yes, we are sinners and the media has picked up on our past and present sins and scandals. But while we are all scandal makers to one degree or another, I am talking of those who are bright lights in history, e.g. St. Francis, Mother Theresa, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine, St. Therese of Lisieux and thousands of others. These people were faithful Catholics and lived holy and miraculous lives for Jesus. Jesus said that a tree is known by

The guidelines for this table were easy for me to follow. I use things from my mother all the time and today is no different. I had two grandmothers in my life growing up and wish I had more things that were once theirs. I am always so envious of other tablescapers with all their heirlooms. I'm not sure how it happened that I have nothing from my maternal grandmother (youngest of 3 sisters, I guess) but I am lucky enough to have something from my paternal grandmother. I was five when she died and I don't remember her very well. I do remember her being very kind and patient with the four of us kids when we would visit her in upstate NY. I am using her cranberry glass decanter and cordial glasses. I think they are from the 1940's. I think I wound up with this set because of my blue and mauve decor in the 80's. At one time I had 4 glasses but a few years back I had a "dishes and glasses" accident. I had a wooden armoire in the corner of my living room for my overflow and I overloaded the shelves. When the shelf fell it sounded as if a train had come through the house. We lost a lot of things that day. I always wondered what finally made it give out. I hadn't put any thing in there for months!

I love reading. I’m your quintessential ’shampoo bottle on the toilet’ reader; I read anything and everything. I also love to write, which I suppose is quite an obvious statement, since the main purpose of starting this blog was to track my progress whilst I attempt to write my first novel. I seem to have found myself in a bit of a ‘Catch-22′, however. I am reading so much about writing – structure; characterisation; how other writers write – that I leave myself with hardly any time to actually do any writing.

On this line of reasoning any 'strangeness' we feel about regarding something as one event is an outcome of our not having one word for it. It also follows that where there is a very common or frequent cause-effect sequence we might well expect that there would be a word for it. There are, of course, many such instances.

There were two other families invited to the dinner at Slipshod's co-worker's house, but neither of them showed up, which we decided was great for us - we got our host and hostess to ourselves, got to know them a little better, and they were so great with the girls. They cooked us the most incredible Indian dinner. Sweet Pea really enjoyed her meal (the girls have had Indian food many times but sometimes they're into it and sometimes they're not so we weren't sure how they would do) but The Bug, usually the more culinarily open-minded, opted for string cheese and a banana (which we had brought along for just such an eventuality) instead. We arrived at our friends' home around 4:30pm and I think the girls ate around 8pm. The adults ate around 9:45pm and we didn't leave for home until 11pm! That was insanely late for the girls to be up, not to mention out, but we had such a good time, and since Sweet Pea had had her uncharacteristic nap earlier in the day, she did quite well. The food was fantastic, as was the company.

Panem is very similar to the cultural perception of how ancient Rome was throughout its history, despite the fact that it was not always ruled by debauched emperors. There is the Capitol, which is rich, decadent and has a complete stranglehold over the outlying districts. In the latter half of the Roman Empire, this was very true because Roman citizens were usually exempt from certain taxes that the provincials had to pay. Life within the province of Italy was usually much better than life in the outlying provinces, which is similar to Panem’s system. Rome also had many provinces and each province was known for its main exports (i.e. Egypt was known as the breadbasket of the empire because of its grain). Panem’s districts are known for their main exports as well, as demonstrated by the fact that the two tributes from each district wear something relating to their district’s main export.
Anyone who knows horse trainer Tom Simmons laughs at this question after having learned first hand what it means. For a horse...it means not having to be under pressure to learn quicker than it can. This is a good thing for a horse who knows nothing about the concept of time, and a bad thing for us who have to be somewhere at a particular time or get a job done by a time frame. Humans are driven by the clock...except for Tom. I swear, Tom is part horse. He thinks like a horse. I have known the man for almost 20 years and he is NEVER in a hurry for anything. A great trait that any horse can and does appreciate.

After the exam I took about a three hour break before heading back to the school to begin the transition to Civ Pro which is this Friday!

They sit in their little chairs for all of three minutes, and then one of them pops up. “I need to give you a hug,” Penny says. Or William, carefully carrying his cereal bowl, announces, “I would like to eat on the floor.” Or they want to open the microwave or feed Marilee a spoonful of baby food or run into the playroom “just for a minute.” They aren’t being intentionally disobedient. They get distracted. It’s hard to be still.
She is currently training for long duration flight on the International Space Station. She is assigned to the Expedition 26 crew and is scheduled to launch from Kazakhstan on the Russian Soyuz in late 2010. She will log more than 4,000 hours orbiting the Earth.
I hate food blogs. I read them all the time, but I hate them. At best, they can be instructively annoying, at worst, simply revolting. They have a use, mind: the average level of condescension in a food blog post means that having read one, I take real enthusiasm in hacking vegetables to shit.

The book also talks about how people have selective memories. We remember what we want to or what has affected us more. Two people who had been in relationship have a complete different recollection of it. When they meet after a long gap this difference in recollection creates a very awkward situation for both. Ignorance is either due to people forgetting about their memories or it can be due to people wanting to forget about it. Author has handled the concept very beautifully and brings about the pain of leaving the homeland and eventual return or the thought of return. Of course, author has used human relationships which influence us all the time.
I must say, the eyeshadow is super soft. I'm not sure if it's just because I'm weird and have not noticed this in other eyeshadows.. but I'm almost certain other eyeshadows aren't this easy to get onto my brush. They're just so pigmented and show up really well when you apply it. Some eyeshadows tend to take a bit of work to build the colour.

I don't take offense to whatever the person who commented on smh.com.au. about how my life is empty, despite the number of clothes and shoes I have. Actually, I thank you, whoever you are.
When Mrs R first saw the picture of Mr Blair with his arms outstretched she as shocked by the way he looks. You see there are people in the Rigby family who are almost exactly his age and some who are many years older - he, unfortunately, resembles the very much older Rigbys who have been retired for quite some years.
Mitt Romney once said that people should be allowed to lose their houses so that deep pocket investors could buy them and make even more huge profits. He says that if high school graduates want to go to college or start a business in these tough times they should borrow the money from their parents, the same parents that he says should lose their jobs and lose their houses. Even though he was responsible for putting together a semi universal healthcare package for Massachusetts, he would prefer to deny the same package for the nation and wants to leave the insurance market alone so corporations can continue to make profits and deny people coverage in their time of need. This is the man who said corporations are people too.
- KIKO - Lip Base Primer: a try. A try gone very well, anyway. This primer has the purpose to neutralize the pigmentation of lips, or most of it, so you can better enjoy the color of your lipstick and create a customized edge with no messing up. It works, it's just a bit sticky when you close the mouth, but not so much, I'm happy for this product, great value.

Glenn Reynolds recently pointed out in the New York Post that conservatives are no more distrustful of science than liberals and progressives, despite the conceit of liberals and progressives that they represent the "evidence-based" school of thought in contrast to creationists, global-warming deniers and other assorted Neanderthals. Conservative distrust, Mr. Reynolds suggests, stems from "the increasing use of science as ammunition for big-government schemes."

Right, I have to start this one off with a confession: I have never seen/heard The Space Pirates ever before!! I know, how can I call myself a fan? I just haven't! There's only one episode out of six that exists to this day, and there is little to no visual representation of this story, it is also the last story that doesn't exist in it's entirety and I had heard I wasn't missing much (we shall see). Unfortunately where the previous story, The Seeds of Death, took the late-sixties obsession with space travel and gave it an ironic twist, The Space Pirates, ah... doesn't.

(iii) decide how much money you will spend on clothes on each semester (or trimester, or month, I don’t know your level of addiction to renewing your wardrobe) and stick to the plan. Look for the sales, friend, the sales. Who cares it’s last season. Everything will be last season a season from now anyway.

... If all clothing was invisible, we wouldn't even have to WORRY about stains, would we? Oh wait, if clothing was invisible, what would be the point of wearing it? Well, I guess it would still be SUPPORTIVE even if invisible, right? Oh nevermind.
By allowing elevated expectations to preempt your experiences, you limit the amount of positive outcomes. If you always manage expectations, you will have more new and exciting experiences, and be pleasantly surprised at how often you are pleasantly surprised.
It's going take some effort to figure out the balance between my old life and my new one, especially since someone forgot to give me that whole working mother manual when I left the hospital. Or maybe I never figure it out at all. Maybe the best I can do is to learn to accept the compromises a little better. To acknowledge that, as so many of you pointed out, you miss some stuff, but you're there for some other stuff. Or as my mother pointed out, that she'll have plenty of other things to hate me for in fifteen years, but traveling for three days in April will just not be one of them.
Now, my sweet friends, it is time that I must say goodbye and a huge THANK YOU to my team mates. I hope to visit them every chance I can get to see what they grace this blog world with...and what they inspire all of us with. Perhaps, we will all come together again at some time. I won't say goodbye to the rest of you, as I do hope to continue to drop in and catch up from time to time. Enjoy life and take each opportunity as it comes.
A book about six friends / colleagues who work in a call center. Working from India to suit US timings is one of the worst jobs that one could take up; it is sad if one is forced to take this kind job to put bread on the table; but it is really sorry if somebody takes this kind of work just for money. The six protagonists work together, socialize together and have generally screwed-up lives (who doesn’t) and when everything comes to a boil one night including a near death experience they come of age and resolve to work towards a rewarding future wherein rewards are counted not only in terms of money.
Unless a miracle happens I am not having surgery. We just found out hubby's insurance opted out of offering obesity medical coverage, meaning any form of medical help. No dietician, no nutritionist, and no bariatric surgery coverage of any kind. Sucks right?

Review your policy to make sure your information is accurate.
Second, Wilde’s proposal seems focused on the largest corporations (FTSE 100 level) where shares are more likely to be owned as an investment than as a means of direct control. But in smaller companies, the control afforded by different sizes of shareholding is often at least as important as the financial value of those shares. Smaller companies could find it hard to secure investment if investors were no longer assured of using their voting power as shareholders to protect their investment.
""After all the promises to get detention centres under control, it is horrifying to find that there has been no progress to stop the use of torture," said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty Libya adviser. "We are not aware of any proper investigations into cases of torture, and neither the survivors or relatives of those who have died in detention have had any recourse to justice or redress for what they have suffered.""
I managed to lose two pounds last week. I definitely drank at least 72 ounces of water a day. On Wednesday I ran a mile on the treadmill in 7 minutes 58 seconds. And I'm pretty sure 31 miles in a week kicks my 20 mile goal in the butt. BOOM. I am seriously liking this mini goal thing, it is very motivating!

Sure, there is an argument that Google are trying to push corporations away from search towards Adwords exactly where they make their income. Certainly, you can find excellent internet sites which have been penalized by the current Panda and Penguin update. However, no matter of the rights and wrongs, the query we ought to ask ourselves is this – what are we going to try and do about it? Perhaps we ought to accept it is time to quit berating Google as a monopoly or as a harsh parent or dictator. Why not make it a whole lot less difficult for ourselves and take into account that Google might just be wanting to serve the best interests of its search engine users.

A brief examination confirms that the prop is only a bit deformed but it spins freely on the driveshaft. Clearly some sacrificial shear-pin or its equivalent has broken internally to save the transmission from damage in such an event and we are reduced to rowing or paddling the dink. An indulgent brunch would be a nice substitute for a snorkel, right? We move Kokomo to the mooring ball closest to the dive shop dock to reduce our rowing efforts for the coming afternoon and settle into a comfortable midday. Wreck Alley will be our deepest dive so far, being down at a consistent 85-90 feet as opposed to the maximum Rhone depth of 80ish, shallowing from there to 60 and less.

“Since 2007, Blue Springs has had a “no garbage” policy,” said Camp Ranger Paul Garofolo. “All campers are required to take home any non-recyclable or non-compostable items. That’s 15,000 campers each year bringing home their garbage, which saves the camp considerable costs in private garbage collection. It also reminds campers about what materials they could pack instead that would reduce their garbage.”

We had a nice little conversation with them. We've never had neighbors come over to meet us with a welcome gift in hand and a Christmas card as well.
I think that there might have been one other dream scene but I am not sure, I just know that these dream scenes were like daydreams, and I would return to watching my cornbread cook after each daydream ended.

My Prediction – Sadly I think that tool John Cena wins. The WWE simply does not let their golden boy lose in the big match. I have seen a lot of people say that The Rock will shake Cena’s hand after he is defeated and I pray that isn’t true. To show Cena respect after a year of talking about how much he dislikes him just isn’t logical.
It is apparent that there is no death.

POV of the teller. The scene visually commits to the teller seeing Manny as a criminal by focusing on his hand reaching into his coat, an act not dissimilar from the adjusting of his coat in Shot 1, which would appear to be innocent at first, but suspect in retrospect.
This sort of leads me into the next question: telling the story from the point of view of the child allows for a slower reveal than if we'd seen it from an omniscient narrator's point of view; we've got to work a little harder as readers to put together the pieces (which is appreciated from this reader's pov). How much thought do you put into how the reader will perceive the story?
Looking ahead to verses 23-25 this prayer was answered for he could relate a message from God that lives would be spared and thus, bearing that testimony of the Lord.
Now Snyderman has issued a similar standing order to “get vaccinated” but, this time, she is accusing parents of unvaccinated children for causing the deaths of six California infants, who have reportedly died from complications of B. pertussis whooping cough. On July 28, 2010, Dr. Snyderman further alleged that “most people” with religious objections to vaccination are not telling the truth and that the “needs” of the “community as a whole” are “better than the individual” and “more important.” 3

There is no widespread benefit from mass immigration, it is a vehicle for change that's all was intended for. But of a change which only brings destruction, and the only purpose of which is to replace what was already there, nothing more.

We also need to provide the politics. We need to help mobilize the working class in its own defence in a general way. This is the class that can bring society to a halt by witholding its labour, just as the rich are currently witholding their capital. Then when we’re organized and politicized, we can go on the offensive.

After sandwiching the layers together with ginger jam, you then have to sweeten some mascarpone cheese with a little icing sugar and spread it over the top and sides of the cake. I thought it would never work as the cheese was very runny and I fully expected it all to slide off the cake into a sort of moat around the base. Elizabeth had the brilliant idea of putting it back in the fridge for a while to see if it thickened up and by some miracle it did actually stick to the sides and not slide off.
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: Only the mind experiences. All the experiences are of the mind. The experience of the soul is also at the level of the mind. When the mind is calm, then the soul is experienced. The soul is an embodiment of joy. Mind experiences sorrow. When the mind dissolves, then joy is experienced.

So my advice during this extremely wet period of drought, yes the hosepipe ban still stand for this area, is to avoid riding Wakerley Wood for your own sanity and also for the good of the trail. I’m heading down that way myself tomorrow evening but you can be sure that I’ll be sticking to the weatherproof surfaces of Fineshade rather than churning up the Wakerley Mud.
I am a fool. I, probably like a lot of people, thought your advice did not apply to me. More accurately, I did not think all of your advice applied to me. I didn’t think I really needed to read through all of the query shark posts before shooting my query off to you. So I read about half, rewrote, and then sent it off. As I waited I continued to read, and I learned so much more.
email me =) and we'll help each other get to the top

I wouldn’t go as far as saying that the Asus Eee PC 1005HA netbook is the fastest computer in the market, but it does have almost all of the latest specifications for a netbook. First of all it is powered by the Intel Atom N280 processor (1.66Ghz), which is currently the fastest processor for a netbook. It comes with 1GB of RAM, 802.11n wi-fi capabilities, Bluetooth 2.1 connectivity and a 1.3MP webcam.
* Friday evening was "The Backyard" ... its our program for kiddos but I tell you what, I probably laugh louder then anyone there. Its just the funniest thing.

This is the Imperial Bar. It’s not much to look at from the outside, though there is some interesting stained glass and the carved wooden frontage appears to date from the 1930s. More interesting is that there appears to have been a drinking shop on this site continuously for at least 150 years.

Don’t think for a moment that there will be a lull in momentum or ministry at Winthrop Wesley. The search process for a new Director of Winthrop Wesley will begin immediately. Your passion, commitment and enthusiasm for this ministry will be especially important as we begin this process and as we live into our next steps as a ministry. I have full confidence in our students, our Board and our amazing supporters and alumni with the awesome Spirit guiding us as we move forward! Please be in prayer for our new Director, the search committee and our continued ministry this semester.

No wonder the Finns would light bonfires on Easter Saturday to chase the witches away. If it weren't forbidden these days, the Suomenlinna bastions would be perfect locations to build great spring fires. By the time you read this, I will have been up walking on the ramparts, welcoming Easter and shaking my fist, not at the flying witches, but at the falling snow!

Bertram, or whoever he was, was doing his darndest to get through to me. He was practically jumping up and down and shouting, and he was putting a great deal of pressure on me. I didn’t like it one bit, and I held on to Orion for dear life, asking over and over, “Is this OK? Is this going to be a problem? Should I be working with this guy?” I couldn’t get a clear answer. I didn’t have the sense that Bertram was evil or malicious, but he was coming on awfully strong, and considering my previous negative experiences, I wanted to be cautious. I didn’t want to overreact or freak out, though, and I held a center of calm as best I could.

It made me realize that even though Sunny had been like smoke, moving here and there so silently that I sometimes forgot he was here, that he was an important part of our "family". He will never be Mr Social but his quiet presence is just as important as all the antics of the girls.

I like to think that God knows what tomorrow holds for He is already there. He knows how He wants us to fit into His big picture. This is what we see in James 4:13-15.

So, I wrote a REALLY long little diary entry about yesterday, since it was about 30 hours long for me from wake up to sleepy time, but I’ll post about all of that on my regular blog and then link to it later for you. The abridged version is that I arrived in the morning (also 9am) and had a whole day sans luggage (which was taken by the man in charge of picking us up) to walk the city. I spent 5 or 6 hours in Tokyo trying to meet a friend and see my 13th Claes sculpture. It was ALL metro stops and wind delays. I met awesome people who helped me, since my Japanese is NOT great and I really can’t read more than a few characters yet. But I saw the sculpture, ate some tempura, and then made my way back to the honbu.
