Dad, THANKFULLY, entered a Memory Care facility in August 2009. He has mellowed some, thanks to medications and the progression of his illness. I enjoy being with him, especially when his fun-loving personality comes to the surface. His wife is certainly the angel who is there with him everyday, making sure he is well-cared for. Yes, your ex-husband is the luckiest man alive. You were his first caretaker who made it possible for him to be the great Ob/Gyn that he became. You were there with him at Ohio State encouraging him to study for his medical degree. You were there with him when he traveled with me to Washington State to do his residency, then my sister was born. You were there with him when he traveled to Stockton to do his internship, then my brother was born. You were there with him when he started his first medical practice on Florin Road near Franklin Blvd and you worked in his office making sure he got paid. You were there with him when he bought his first house in Larchmont Riviera. And you were there with him when he gave us all the news that he was leaving us to be with someone else. And you were there with me, my sister, and brother to ensure that we did not falter, that we became excellent, productive citizens in this great country of ours.

At the church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, visitors can see murals painted by Delacroix including his provoking Jacob Wrestling with the Angel.

Unfortunately for that third world oil based economy, they, like the Ukrainians, Belarus and Poles, who all though they had some form or another of leverage over Russia are finding out that they have been out maneuvered yet again. Just as North Stream maneuvered Russian gas out of the hands of Belarus, the Baltics and Poland, allowing Germans to actually sell gas to the Poles and set rates on a nation that was used to setting rates on Poland, and as South Stream is soon to allow the same to replace the Ukrainian games, so the new cosmodrome in Siberia's Vostochny, will allow Russia to cut the greedy Kazakhs right out of the equation.

The Army released suicide data today for the month of March. During March, among active-duty soldiers, there were 18 potential suicides: three have been confirmed as suicides and 15 remain under investigation. For February, the Army reported 11 potential suicides among active-duty soldiers. Since the release of that report, five have been confirmed as suicides and six remain under investigation. For 2012, there have been 45 potential active-duty suicides: 20 have been confirmed as suicides and 25 remain under investigation. Updated active-duty suicide numbers for 2011: 164 (164 have been confirmed as suicides and none remain under investigation).

Because the average revenue of an employer firm was just shy of $4 million in 2007, as compared to $45,000 for non-employers, adding relatively few employer firms makes a huge difference in terms of economic impact. Despite the growth in the number of businesses from 2002 to 2007, Black-owned companies only increased from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent of revenues of all U.S. businesses. For employer firms, the revenue share remained at 0.3 percent and the share of payroll at 0.5 percent.

dear lily,
Sporadic sounds of shooting persist, still coming from north of the river. Still isolated short bursts of fire, automatic rifles and occasionally heavy machine guns. I did get concerned around 8 p.m. when, instead of the usual “bang bang/pop pop pop” I heard “CRUMP CRUMP CRUMP” — explosions, not shots. Fortunately I haven’t heard that sound since.

JOSEPH RIIPPI is the author, most recently, of the novella A Cloth House and poetry chapbook Treesisters. His novel Do Something! Do Something! Do Something! was published in 2009, and his story collection, The Orange Suitcase, was released in 2011. His work has appeared in a wide range of venues, including The Collagist, BOMB's Word Choice, Tin House Flash Fridays, Pank, Elimae, NANO Fiction and The Brooklyn Rail. A Seattle native, he now lives with his wife in New York City.
Historically, however, one particular philosopher has read Judeo-Christian morality in the opposite way to Spencer. The German philosopher Friederich Nietzsche, being no stranger to subversion and in spite of his open atheism, saw the move to Christian ideals of compassion, pity and meekness as a very intelligent move in the history of Western values, or at least the point where humans became intellectually interesting. According to his book The Genealogy of Morals published in 1887, the only way in which the powerless slave underclasses of Rome and Greece could inflict revenge for their oppression was by conceptually reorienting the brutish practices of the strong and beautiful aristocracy of nobles, introducing new moral considerations, such as choice, responsibility, conscience and guilt. By these notions the actions of the upper classes, characterised by unreflective and barbaric displays of aggression, violence and cruelty, were finally condemnable.
Waiting for the tram back into Manchester. This is Trafford Bar station at around 3:45 on a January afternoon.
Fast forward three hours, and the doctor came to check again. She said I was 9 cm and to let her know when I felt "some pressure down there". Hmmm, being that I was numb from the waist down, I couldn't really feel much of anything - which was lovely, by the way. Less than an hour later, the nurse (who had been checking my progress on the monitor's at the nurse's station) came in and checked me - and informed me that I was 10 cm, the head was right there, and NOT to push because the baby would come out and the doctor wasn't there yet. She texted and called the doctor and within minutes, the doc was there. They put my legs up and said "go". Three big pushes later, he was out and screaming! Dad-E cut the cord (and double-checked to make sure all the "parts" were there) and there we were with our new baby, minutes before noon. We had only been at the hospital for about 4 hours, and it was already over. It was a great experience and I'm so glad he's finally here, even though he's just a tad early and we were a tad unprepared.
But as a formality they had to have an adoption home study done.
On the drive through the state park which dominates the northern tip of the island, we saw several of the ponies along the road, but once we were in the national park, the ponies were well hidden in the marshes and forests. V was particularly thrilled with our campsite which backed right up to the short dunes that divide the Atlantic side of the island from the wooded bay side. She loves to camp at the beach, and I'm not sure there's better beach camping than the paved dune-access sites here.
Today we got through school and it was picturesque. We sat on a blanket under the tree and read, we finished all of our work before lunch and had a great day. Perhaps perspective and prayer really are the key to it all. When am I gonna learn?

My second problem is that I have absolutely nothing guarding my heart. I feel like I should pull back and that I should go slower. That I should build a wall. Not be so trusting. But how? It’s like a dam broke once we decided to go for it and now I can’t build a wall with everything spilling out. And honestly, that’s not me. I’m the kind of girl that gives it all, everything. I don’t think you should hold back on your feelings. I think you should tell people how you feel. Life is too short. Sometimes you get hurt and sometimes you have to pick up the broken pieces. I was expressing this fear to my BFF on Monday and she told me that so far he has given me absolutely no reason not to trust him. And holding back isn’t going to do any good. And that if I end up broken, she will be there with me every step of the way. (I’m telling you, everyone needs a friend like that in their life, I am blessed.) So I’ve decided not to pull back, to keep going. To wear my heart on my sleeve and hope that it stays in one piece this time.
Now many have been praying, asking, and meditating for a level of consciousness to come onto the planet that is fair, that is not abusive of power, and that does not take advantage of one another. We are now in the process of witnessing what has been prayed for come into reality. But if you hear that as fear, you’re not hearing the message. The message is that the Shift is unstoppably unfolding, and it will touch each of us profoundly, but each of us absolutely has the capacity to move within, through, and around it, as well as to influence it.

Still. A good soul. So the Matron and her husband gave this young man a month in their home. Two weeks in, she realized the circumstances that left him roofless were not being transformed. Yes -- he was successfully enrolled in college but conquering that corner of life was the extent of his capabilities. Doing college AND earning a livable wage in a stable unit he paid for was genuinely beyond his reach.

It sucks for gays and lesbians that in places like North Carolina, and Ohio, and even California, all that can done at the moment is to assure those of them who would like to marry those they love is to tell them that it will get better.

For the opening third of L.A. Noire, I didn't understand Phelps. I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. Normally, I play the good guy, or at least the cool anti-hero, and it took me a long time to realise that Phelps is just an arrogant prick. L.A. Noire became much more enjoyable after that. It wasn't my fault that Phelps was a human wrecking-ball; I just had to deal with it. But I was relieved when control switched to the far more agreeable Jack Kelso late in the story.

In some kind of right-wing sci-fi world you could conjure up a society in which massive inequality existed but everyone's needs were served - enough food, shelter, education and health provision, and access to leisure facilities and goods. This after all was the 1950s American dream and was projected worldwide as if the whole of America lived in detached houses planted on half-acre sites. Out of sight tens of millions didn't live that even at the height of the boom years of car and armament production.

2. There was joy and satisfaction in the teaching/feeding…a sense of nutrition and competence. I was teaching (and I am trying hard to not be self congratulatory) on futurizing (how do we do this? what do we pay attention to? what do we measure?) and then I taught a seminar on life balance (our outer and inner life) with lots of examples and clear pictures of how it works. They appreciated the clarity and concern expressed in both seminars. It’s good to know where we are heading and what to anticipate on the way. Does your group know where it’s going? What to anticipate along the way?

Metta World Peace. It’s all been said, he’s clearly not sane. Fortunately for the Lakers, despite the impressive April World Peace was having, their playoff hopes do not rest on the far from level head of that man. Unfortunately for the Lakers, they have plenty other problems, their lack of depth chief among them. Also, their 3-7 record against the five teams above them in the standings (Oklahoma City,San Antonio,Chicago,Miami, andIndiana) is disconcerting. Having said all that, anything is possible with Kobe Bryant leading your team. And don’t forget they haven’t lost any of that length that gave them an advantage over every team they played en route to winning titles in 2009 and 2010.

According to Indigo Evolution, Indigos often sound very wise for their age; however, they are very sensitive physically, emotionally and spiritually, and not always comfortable in their own bodies. They easily experience sensory overload to lights, smells, sounds, touching and toxins, and need help in becoming grounded. Many Indigos have attention and social problems in school and may frequently correct the teacher. While their behaviors vary, their philosophy of life is consistent; they have a high level of social consciousness and desire to make the world a better place. They are here to bring the Dawn of the Golden Age!
WHY IT MATTERS: Basically, because people who think that sex is for recreation, and that it is ok to kill children to avoid any limits on the pursuit of happiness are not qualified for marriage. You can’t enter into an intimate commitment with someone who is willing to commit murder in order to get out of the consequences of their own selfish pursuit of pleasure. That is not going to work in a marriage – you need someone who makes good decisions, avoids harming others, is chaste and self-controlled, and takes responsibility for her actions when they go awry.

The second key phrase is: ‘No one man should have all this power’. The obvious identity of the man is Kanye. Again, it is a dual symbol: it reinforces the notion of him being an immensely powerful figure whilst at the same time undermining its legitimacy. For Kanye, that power comes from a complex relationship between those who hate him – including, at some point, himself; and how he might use the notion of those who hate him as a way to understand that he is taking the correct path. If Kanye, in ‘Power’, doesn’t share a direct and entire comparison with Mersault, they do possess a similar duality that means that they both love to hate and hate to love.
My husband Hunter and I got married 2 years ago at the beautiful historic Queenscliff Hotel and we recently went back there to celebrate Hunter’s birthday, where I had this gorgeous dessert. I was really surprised how the blueberry and thyme ‘soup’ is such a fresh herby foil to the richness of the chocolate. Even though I’m not a dessert person usually, I gobbled it up and then asked for the recipe.

I watched the kids wave good-bye and shout “I love you Daddy” as he drove away and I thought about how I felt. All morning I had thought about all the things he was going to GET to do, but I had not thought about all the thing he was going to MISS. He was going to miss sleepy morning smuggles and tight goodnight squeezes. He was going to miss blueberry yogurt covered faces and bath time splashes. He was going to miss watching Discovery Channel and sharing popcorn with his buddy. He was going to miss laying down in bed at night with the one he loves and waking up to the sound of “Daddy, Daddy, Daddy are you up?” He was going to miss L saying all her new words and G counting to 10. He was going to miss all the tantrums and all the funny things our kids do daily. He was going to miss so much and I was pouting about missing out on a bagel tray for breakfast. Really outs it in perspective doesn’t it?

Some food travel guides are merely a list of restaurants, but they lack explanatory information on cuisine, and also fail to provide the vocabulary that might be useful for a foreign traveler. If the Tokyo edition is indicative of the quality of the rest of their books, then The Terroir Guides might be a model for other culinary travel guides.
I have to give it to the musical composers for video games… This is hard stuff! The FX area is equally as difficult, but you at least have an idea what you want it to sound like pre-recording. I knew Oop was going to plop when he jumps off the ground (the sound of goop when it unsticks?) and splat when it landed (again the sound of goopy things when they hit solid surfaces) and that would create so much personality for Oop. I am openly proud of my crappy effects I put on Oop combined with the animations.
I saw the blood. A dark shadow of scarlet which went nowhere in all directions. There were flowers too. A single bunch. “How Romantic the poor are,” I thought, “or maybe somebody got married?” I Laughed. The end of Darren Brown! That evil cunt who had taken me at knifepoint and forced me to commit robberies to fund his habit, sending me into a wild Africans home while he was still there. Me chucking half defrosted fish at him as he lunged towards me like a huge bear with yellow teeth. I made my escape: a 20ft drop from the back window, landing on Daniel Kinsella who was sucking the entrails out of a roach he had picked up from somewhere. A pair of Adidas Samba's catching him in the bristle of his adolescence. An horrendous tough jaw, twisting out of shape and his fists instinctively clenching because something had hit him. A dull thud in my ear, the side of my head red, throbbing sounds from bust eardrums: “God, I'll never hear the sea again!” I thought, as we legged it back to the relative safety of the Estate, pursued by a clucking, screaming, knife wielding crack head.
In the home. Memories and tales told by candlelight. Butter is churned. Soap is poured into molds. Quilts are sewn. Kids get bathed. Coffee brews. Gumbo simmers. The home, the backbone. Walls that hold up a roof.

Patrizio hopes to prevent age-related infertility by combating these misconceptions with education. "As clinicians, we should begin educating women more aggressively," Patrizio said. "Women should be given the appropriate information about postponing fertility, obstetric risks, and the limited success of ART in advanced age to allow them to make informed decisions about when, if at all, they hope to become pregnant."
Let’s review the Word of God. It’s answers will surprise people — because God’s ways are not our ways and God’s thoughts are not our thoughts. God’s ways and His thoughts are higher than our ways and thoughts. Therefore, we should expect that God’s answer will be entirely different than we would think if left to our own devices of our own deductive reasoning (even as Christians). It is the Bible that will answer the question. And when the Bible presents the answer, we as Christians are called upon by God to forsake our own thoughts and receive God’s thoughts in the renewing of our minds with His Word.

We do not earn salvation merely by what we say. In fact, we do not earn salvation at all. It is a gift from God. But our mouths are what we are to use to confess the salvation we have received. Have you ever made a public profession of your faith?
And they continue to aggregate more power at the federal level -- and to build their own personal wealth -- ignoring and flouting the law.

It's a procedure that's been put together in a rush – albeit with good intentions – and it shows. Basic issues are unaddressed, such as how the administrator should decide between ties. When you have a hundred or so people recommending a hundred different books for four slots, you’re going to get a lot of ties. I can't imagine that there’s a fair way to decide between ten books that all got three votes, and putting them all onto the shortlist would be ridiculous (and isn’t countenanced by the new rules). Rolling a D10 is great when it comes to dodging a goblin's sword thrust, but it's not how the BFA shortlist should be decided!

Most of the Vintage Vamps on display speak several languages and all would not look out of place on a Fred Olsen cruise liner.

The backdrop to her various picture poses looks distinctly Chelsea Harboury. Like all her colleagues she dislikes a 'Lack of personal Hygiene, Manners, Drunks & Drug-Users.' Not bankers, too?

I loved all the different varieties - fuzzy stickers, shiny ones, and even scratch-and-sniff. Visiting the Sandylion Sticker Outlet was definitely a blast from the past as I recognized some of the stickers that I had as a child still up for sale at the warehouse outlet store!

It really is a shame because my children are missing out as well. But I have to get over this. My children ARE better off without her in their lives. There will never be a broken promise, they will never have to see her battered and bruised because she insists on allowing a man to beat her, they will never have to hug her and wonder what the stench is coming off of her. They will never have to hear her tell them 'I have given you everything....oh right except love' (and yes she did once tell me that)
This fireplace has some amazing tilework around the firebox. Combined with the timeless clock and pop of red on the mantel, it creates a lovely scene. They even show (gasp!) a TV in this room.

It seems the dance is reinstated. For those who give their whole life to immerse themselves in the ocean of His words, they live in another world and are creating a new attractor for the dance, a new way of being. For those who are fishing from that ocean, not convinced that they can live within, new products and forms are brought forth. Those who wander on the beach head notice the remnants of recent generations of effort, wasted in the sand, and are inspired. And those who spend their days eking an existence from a briny wastewater, hear only rumours of a seemingly mythological paradise, and ignore them.

While standing still watching falling stars, the creatures of the night begin to howl – sounds reflecting from one mountain range to another, stirring a chill that surges from your toes to your nose – a strange feeling so powerful, you swear your skin is standing at attention, while your racing heart echos inside your ears – then, all of a sudden, the world under the winter solstice night sky becomes silent – you spend another hour of dead silence in the icy cold air searching the heavens for movement, then head back to the cabin, where the warm flickering flames of the hearth are inviting.

He called the day of his birthday. I was so excited to talk to him, I think it was one of the first times I'd talked to him since he pushed forward into Marjah. I was so excited to talk to him that I just kind of started babbling on about all the new things A was doing and how we were. Then he said someone had let him use the sat phone because it was his birthday. Of course I hadn't forgotten his birthday but I just got so excited talking to him I didn't say it right away. I said something along the lines of "OH MY GOD HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I knew it was your birthday and I was so excited for your birthday I just forgot to say it, gosh I suck" I know it went something like that. He didn't mind. He was happy to talk to us for his birthday.

Uncle Kent told the greatest stories of what was happening in his life. He was a lawyer in Seattle, incredibly successful, whose kids never really came to these functions or participating in the family because they were off studying in Finland or rescuing animals in countries inaccessible to us. So we stared and responded in awe, amazed with what they’re doing, creating images of ideal sons and daughters that we will always and forever fail to live up to.

When HIP works, well played and deeply understood, it is fabulous. I would like to be the first to applaud JEG for his Schumann and his amazing Bach Cantatas series, which I'm potty about (I've also heard him screw up a couple of romantic operas over the years, but there is no reason why every conductor should be equally good in all repertoire, is there?). Ditto for Norrington: I'm a hundred per cent with Sir Colin on that total lack of vibrato - yowch! - and remember with sorrow an absolute carwreck of a Dvorak Cello Concerto at the RFH... Yet I've attended performances in which he's conducted Haydn's The Creation, Mozart's The Magic Flute (a Prom about 25 years ago), Schubert's Ninth and the Berlioz Symphonie fantastique - all of them thrilling, vivid and loving.

Listen to the tape part of the Third Symphony--a cut-and-paste job that trounces most of the computer-music generation in its imagination and feeling for what's possible. Epithalamion features material originally intended for, of all things, Lindsay Anderson's film This Sporting Life. Not that its impact is any less than coherent; the percussion writing alone has a fantasy that will keep you entranced. Well prepared performances, superbly recorded. This is still music of the future. --Richard Whitehouse

One of the more famous episodes in Smiths session history, this song was originally produced by John Porter, signed, sealed and delivered, ready to go. Then for whatever reason the band had a rethink, decamped to another studio with Stephen Street, and re-recorded the song (sampling some of Porter's guitar work in the process, to save time - which miffed Porter, understandably, since they never asked for permission). This original version is much more jangly, with Porter on emulated sitar, while the final Street take is all T.Rex'ed out. Honestly, I'd have to say I prefer the Street version, though that could be due to familiarity more than anything else (as I usually love Porter's stuff with Marr). That said... the stereo transfer here brings yet another track to life; Marr's zingy guitars are *all* over the stereo field and it's really a wonderful recording. It's almost as if Porter knew this was the last time he'd be working with the band (it was), so he had Marr lay down 30 times more guitars than normal as a parting gift. Sounds really spectacular in headphones.
Why memoirs? These are notes to remind me of my 2010 T-Day experience. You know-What went right and what went wrong! Organization is key to get everything done. A few helping hands is really, really nice. Cooking techniques and recipes are something I am always working on. I am a chronic meddler so I always have to change something up or bring a new, untried recipe to the table. (I can hear the groans as I write!) I almost brought two this year, but then I thought am I seriously nuts. Stay with what works! My family looks forward to what is served on T-Day and that anticipation should not be messed with. This is the only time of the year we have a whole roasted turkey, cornbread dressing, mushroom gravy, cranberry sauce and my Granny's homemade rolls. If it works and they love it - don't mess with it.

We then ate breakfast at Over Easy Cafe, a very popular local spot.

Since it was noon by now, we did not see many birds, just a few ducks including Moorhens and Pied-Billed Grebes and a couple Herons.

So, please pray, my friends. Pray fervently for the town of Brookfield. We are genuinely living out Frank Peretti’s book, “This Present Darkness” and it is awesome to see…but at the same time, it is also a little frightening. Ever since I gave my life to Jesus Christ I have been preparing for this battle…but never thought that it would come to my own hometown, or that the Lord would place me at the forefront of the battle. Honestly, I do NOT want to be there, but I will do what my Lord commands for HIS honor and glory, and not my own.

Hercules died on Sunday. Chris and Dawn called in the evening from their home and property in Oxford Mills, where we had dropped off Hercules last year. He'd shown no signs of illness or injury on Saturday night, when Chris let him out with Goldie and Shadow for a final run. But he didn't return with the other dogs. Chris looked for him in the darkness, to no avail, and then returned to the search in the morning. He found Hercules by the pond, about 75 m from the house, alive but unable to stand. Hercules died on the way to see the vet in Kemptville. The vet couldn't find an exact cause, but saw signs of internal bleeding. He speculated about cancer, although I wonder if Hercules finally realized his dream of cornering a deer and received a fatal kick for his troubles. Hercules was ten.

The problem is that for one thing, it isn’t very funny. Yes, it certainly has an authenticity about how this generation of teens feels the need to capture every aspect of their lives and share it via social networking and videos but there is a caveat there – most of our lives, teens and adults alike – are too damn boring to warrant much an hour and a half in the theaters let alone streaming video.

Even less noticed by the MOS in Jakarta was the quake and tsunami in the Mentawi islands. These are remote islands on the western frontier that, if pressed, some Indonesians might know exist. By comparison, a tidal wave in the Aleutian islands of Alaska that kills a handful of polar bears would generate more interest in the average New Yorker. Furthermore, the death counts have obviously been exaggerated, as recent reports note that more than 100 folks have been found alive in the affected area. As with all media and government information, though, one should never let a few facts stand in the way of a sensational story, especially when a potential tsunami of aid money is involved.

A rainy weekend is usually pretty quiet around here anyway. A big night in at the Fibro generally constitutes a good meal, good wine and some crap television.

But ‘Smiffy’ was still there, so all was right with the world. I am strangely attracted to Smiffy.

My agent put it this way: “You need to ground the magic in something organically Russian.” I don’t know if she had any idea beyond that; in fact, I know she didn’t. But that one sentence sparked an idea in me. I needed to dig into Russian folklore and fairy tales – cause that’s where I’d find magic. And I wanted something that would fit the strong woman vibe of the novel. And that in turn led me to Baba Yaga. (okay – I was sad about the portal thing for awhile. But eventually I got over it.)

Having a conversation with your friends about their body-negativity is not an easy thing. If you feel that it’s changing your perception of your own body though, you have every right to speak up. Explain that you’d like to see a change in the way you talk about your bodies, and see if they’d be interested in making a communal effort to knock out the body snarking. If they keep up their body-hating around you instead of respecting your wishes, take notice of common times when their comments are at an all-time high so you can avoid those situations. You have the right to do your own thing and meet them at the bar or party on a Friday night instead of getting ready with them and spending 20 minutes trying to convince them they do not look fat in those pants.
I made a thank you card today for the person that let us stay at their beach house. This is also your freebie for the day! I do hope that you like it as much as I do - I think it turned out really nice: it cuts well, looks good, and isn't made up of a million tiny pieces! :0)

See where that TV is? Well, we moved it elsewhere cause we NEVER used it in here. But when I put it up I had to leave some of the boards for the board and batten off so I’d have room for the TV mount. And when I took the mount down that was pretty obvious. ;) The mount also left some honkin’ holes in the wall. FUN TIMES.
They destroy. We will build. And rebuild.
In the hindsight today it makes sense, whether it is the jungle or corporate world a strong leader is required and the followers automatically fall in line.
There are so many politicians (both French and American) who don't really understand the internet or the dynamics of the new digital market place but still try to make laws to control it, that I really like that this show brings together true experts to examine the issues. I also like watching Média le Magazine on France 5, but a couple weeks ago there was a journalist talking about Facebook who made a couple comments that weren't 100% true. With Écrans.fr, they really know what they're talking about.
I had various plans for this afternoon, but annoying bits of life intervened and I hardly got anything done. I think I'll have an early night and give it another go tomorrow. It's the Sage's sale on Friday and I haven't got my papers ready yet - not that I have a lot, he does most of the bookwork as you'd expect at this stage. I don't exactly dread it, but I don't enjoy the sales any longer. And we've got three this year.
#2 is that the boy was starting 6th grade, and needed to get his rear kicked. I’m all about relaxed education in the early years. But when you hit 9th grade, son, you need to be ready to work. And that means middle school is for suffering.

To be honest, there's more than one option. The second option will result in blood in the streets, the deaths of thousands or even millions, and suffering on a colossal scale. When companies don't handle their tendencies to be become too arthritic they go out of business. The equivalent for the country is collapse, civil war and chaos. Something to be avoided if at all possible. Without reform, and without throwing out large chunks of regulations, we are headed there.
In the film of MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, over and over the filmmakers use images of bridges and interesting corridors, or stepping stones in a creek, to underscore significant moments. The heroine first meets her love interest, The Chairman, on a bridge over a stream, with cherry blossoms in the background. Now, those of you with jaded eyes might look at that and think, ‘Oh, right, another “lovers meet on a Japanese bridge in an explosion of cherry blossoms’ scene, but the setting is utterly gorgeous, and I would be very surprised if most of the moviegoing audience even notices the bridge or the cherry blossoms – except subliminally, which is how these things are supposed to register.
I am years away from that feeling again. This book seems meaningless now. All I want is to get home and get my daughter. Under ordinary circumstances, this would have been a beautiful day, at least weather-wise. But now it seems unnaturally hot and sunny and you can’t help think something has gotten into the air, into the sun, that we will all melt within minutes. I don’t think about that yet.

I'm supposed to be finishing writing an article on women and the Hekhalot literature, but instead I just read an entertaining article (and comment thread) on Slate about overrated fiction. Much of the comment thread was actually about books that people really liked. I then took a look at the Modern Library list of 100 Best Novels and thought I'd say something about them. (This is the list put together by their literary board, not the Reader's list).
With regards to Kosovo, one must bear in mind that the attempt of Serbian authorities to alter the constitutional status of Kosovo resulted in the breaking down of Yugoslavia. Serbian politics has to be blames, and the Tribunal in The Hague is trying to do this now. If you think about it, the entire unit of this criminal act is trialed in the Tribunal in The Hague – starting from the President, through the political leaders, and not only from Serbia but from the other former Yugoslavian countries, military commanders and common criminals. It was a normal thing to say that each political party had its phalanx, which proved its loyalty to its leader. These deformations show that Serbians do not have enough capacity to establish a state of law. Their rhetoric is established on the alcoholic evaporations of the nationalistic and confused religious concepts of the Serbian Orthodox Church; the incorrect projects of the Serbian academy, and so on. The entire Serbian elite took part in the breaking down of Yugoslavia – political, military, cultural, and criminal.

To ensure this consistency, making drinks is calculated, measured, and timed. I know that grande triple vanilla soy latte will get exactly four pumps of vanilla syrup, then three shots, then soy milk steamed on AUTO up to the top. I know that I start pulling the shots as soon as I aerate the milk to make sure that they will be done just after the milk is steamed. I know that only cups of coffee and hot americanos get cup sleeves. I know that only frappucinos with chocolate chips get the chocolate sauce drizzle on the whipped cream. Anything beyond that needs to be written on the cup.

I also saw that when the Bible refers to a divine Person, it is never a three-in-one God, or a one-in-three God that is identified. It is always one Person of the Godhead that is speaking, or being referred to.

The essay discussed whether or not Barbarella is a feminist film. What interested me most were the assumptions the young student made about women, and their attitudes, in the late 1960s. We were, apparently, semi-conscious clones, unaware of our enslavement to men, and completely lacking in aspiration, sex drive, or a sense of humour.
This morning's misadventure at the mirror had a purpose totally unrelated to my breasts.......
This is a fabulous ghost story in which Tabitha moves to Weston Manor when her father gets the job of managing the house and its visitors. From the start Tabitha is spooked by the old house; odd sights, strange smells and noises which nobody else notices. Tabitha is a lovely character in a very difficult situation with a depressed mother, a father who might be having an affair and a little brother who she has to look after pretty much all the time when she is at home, and a home which is always scaring her. The aspect which makes this book special is the very clever twist at the end which makes you want to go back and read it again looking for signs.
So far then, the police have a complete failure on the part if the bottom-up sweep, but some progress with the top-down sweep. Pursuing this sweep further, they locate Mister A and place him under physical surveillance for several weeks. This allows them to piece together a picture of his activities and contacts. Further investigation reveals that several of the people so identified have previously come to the attention of the police for one reason or another. Three in particular have convictions for crimes of violence and larceny, and appear strong candidates for being Mister A's accomplices during the robbery.

I took a photograph, through the kitchen window, of the farmer feeding the garden birds. They were all waiting. It must be very hard for them. Nesting last week in temperatures in the late teens and now this. Still, it is set to go today, the barometer is rising and the sun is trying to break through. As Eliot says, "April is the cruelest month."
Not too much went on around my house this weekend. Kevin and I ran some errands Saturday night and ended up at Kyoto Japanese Steakhouse for dinner with my sister which never disappoints. It's rare that I eat my entire plate of food but apparently, this baby had a hankering for some shrimp! It was delicious and I may or may not have asked for it for dinner again last night. ;)

As you read this, rich and powerful people in Washington, DC are trying to determine not whether they should cut programs designed to help low and middle-income Americans, but by how much they should cut those programs. The rich and powerful people in DC are making these cuts in order to pay for tax breaks they recently gave to rich people and large corporations. Additionally, the cuts are being made at the behest of the lobby organizations and media operations owned by rich people and large corporations.

Wasserman-Schultz: we adding private sector
Two days later, on Saturday, I got a phone call from a Best Buy customer relations rep from the corporate office and he told me that he had gotten the e-mail I had sent on Wednesday right after the laptop died. He had talked with the assistant manager who was on duty on Saturday at the Mansfield store and he said they would exchange my computer. I think my chin really did hit the floor. I immediately prayed “Thank you God.” I knew that He had made this happen.
I'm so happy with how this came out. I was feeling unsure midway through but I love my end result. Devious Nature was more watery and runny than I expected. Two coats may have been sufficient but I simply preferred the look of three instead.
We need effective government to regulate markets and protect those of us who don't have the time or expertise to figure it all out. We've had effective regulation in the past, and we can have it again. It's not, really, a matter of brain-power; it's a matter of balls.
However, I soon changed ambition to being a missionary. I grew up near the David Livingstone memorial in Blantyre. While my contemporaries were idolising the Bay City Rollers, I was captivated by the story of David Livingstone. I had a book called "The Great Explorers" in which one of the chapters was about Dr Livingstone. One of the things that remained in my childish imagination was a picture (not, but not unlike, the one above) illustrating the assertion that David Livingstone died while in prayer.

Agatha was the youngest of three. The Millers had two other children: Margaret Frary Miller (1879–1950), called Madge, who was eleven years Agatha’s senior, and Louis Montant Miller (1880–1929), called Monty, ten years older than Agatha. Later, in her autobiography, Agatha would refer to her brother as “an amiable scapegrace of a brother”.[9]

And I've MADE chocolate chip pancakes but never eaten them. Per D, no syrup needed. So, I tried! He's right! No syrup needed. It was pretty good.

Here's the recipe if you're in the mood for pancakes!
It was getting boring and annoying, to be honest. I mean, I grew up in Florida; I saw snakes all the time. Yes, a cobra's venom can kill in three minutes, as the news anchors loved to remind us, but you just stay vigilant and move slowly if you do see a snake. But I cracked up when I saw the inevitable Twitter parody account, first for the snake, then for a Bronx Zoo zookeeper:
The most fallacious argument in the sustainability quiver is the idea that doing things sustainably is cheaper. Doing things sustainably is only cheaper if the following conditions hold: 1. You are operating in a market that accurately and correctly assesses the costs of all externalities, 2. You are evaluating the cost model over a long time scale (i.e. decades or centuries, not quarters), and 3. You are willing to put a reasonable dollar value on the cost of ecological disturbance and/or destruction (OK, this is really part of number 1, but it needs emphasis). If your accounting does these three things, then ‘sustainable approaches’ are always more cost effective (note: this does not mean that any particular technology that claims to be sustainable is). If, however, your accounting system still operates on 3 month cycles and systematically disregards the externalities of its own processes (which is de jour in contemporary global business practice), then your accounting system will continue to tell you that sustainability is a bad investment, period (except for when it is really good marketing).

To his credit Paddick made a greater play for the ‘black vote’ than any other candidate, talking boldly about racism in the Met and disproportionate black youth unemployment. By contrast Livingstone seemed to assume he already had the ‘black vote’ sown up and in the bag, and therefore didn’t have to ‘risk’ alienating sections of the wider population by raising issues of racism.
Toad in the Hole is a traditional English dish of sausages cooked in Yorkshire pudding batter, I also add bacon to the mix, for extra porky deliciousness. I like it with loads of onion gravy, mash & something green, last night it was brussels sprouts. We had friends around for dinner, and my toad was a hit, I urge you to give it a go, particularly on a cold winters evening when a good solid dinner is required.
Insurance is known as the miracle of pen and ink, it creates dollars via the purchase of a policy with the strike of pen on paper. You can create 100′s of thousands of dollars and pay just pennies on the dollar per year for the coverage.

Back in October I saw this news report about this nurse that was receiving cards of hope for breast cancer patients. I wanted to participate in sending a card but unfortunately could not get mine completed until now. I contacted Nurse Mortl and she indicated to me that she was trying to keep this going all year and welcomed any card(s) I had and encouraged me to let my friends know. So if anyone is interested in making a card, please contact me and I will provide you with the mailing address. So here is the card I made.

Only a few go the distance like Joan and Keith, for whom no drug will ever supplant their rooted allegiance to rock, which is why they're free to do as much of anything else as they want. The rest of us may have rocked and had a good time, but love of rock never really supplanted our love of drugs or our longing for a sense of rooted creature comfort, when push came to shove. We'd rather stay home and listen to music and get high than go out on the road and deal with afternoon soundchecks at bars still reeking of smoke, booze, sweat and vomit from the night before. We'd rather not have to worry about staying more or less sober until after the first set. And we hope Dakota doesn't turn out like us, but on the other hand, you can't hang in the doorway forever. As for the real Cherie Curie, she finally found her own Keith Richards life preserver...with chainsaw sculpture! Big sister, burn on!

What an amazing success with dinner tonight!!!! I wasn't sure how the girls were going to like pork tenderloin because it is hit or miss (usually a miss) with meat, but I wanted to make it. I looked easy to make and something quick I could put together without much prep. When the tenderloin was in the oven I let the girls try a little bit of the rub that was on the tenderloin and they liked it. I made some peas (which I know they love) and gave them a little bit of the pork. They could stop eating it! I had to make them eat their peas just to slow them down. We could have easily eaten the full pound of tenderloin just the four girls and myself. So if you are looking for something that has a lot of flavor and picky eaters might like, I recommend this recipe!!

Then I went to town on the Art Critics. I wrote several more stories about New Orleans, then tackled the section about New Mexico and would the thing up with a trip back east by my main characters. Along the way, I incorporated a bunch of other short stories into the manuscript into it vaguely resembled a novel. Then, as if it was a bottle of wine I let it sit for about a year. About a year ago I started rewriting and querying. I only received three requests for partials out of nearly a 100 inquiries. So I gave up on the queries and kept on with the revision. Just this past June, I published the completed manuscript, even though I could not afford an editor. The front cover is also of my own making. I’m glad it’s done with for now I can return to the original manuscript I tackled during national writing month. Still I’m pleased as punch that I was able to create a novel out out of a short story.

The orange juice was so tart I thought my face was going to fall off (and I love tart / sour stuff!)

I also made pizzelles. :-) There is still some coughing and sneezing (thus albuterol and other meds), but everyone is on the mend. :-) We will be spending a lot of the next few days in Church and getting ready to celebrate the Lord's Resurrection, so we used the day to get as ready as we could.

That was it. We landed on some landing lake. Then got delivered to the airport and checked into Hilton, courtesy of Bettles Air and free of charge. They told us that we can use some old open hangar to cook and even shower. That hangar had a small kitchen, non-working stove, a bathroom of some sort. Some people were rebuilding old airplanes there. Interestingly there were bug repellent bottles on almost every table. I guess mosquitoes were really bad there (Did I tell you that there are almost 40 species of mosquitoes in Alaska).

NORTHERN TERRITORY
Roll forward to Thursday 26th April, her official Birthday. The build up was ENORMOUS, her expectation HUGE. A reminder the night before of how many gifts she was expecting and that breakfast in bed should be forth coming, and finally she retired to bed, quite late, very tired but excited for the next days event. I had the breakfast tray ready to go, her gifts were wrapped and ready to deliver and in the morning as I heard her early yawning…..loudly…..to let us know that she was awake, I rose, and tried to get organised. But not quickly enough and Joseph shuffled her out of her room into the lounge room to a dishevelled wife, struggling to get her breakfast bits together. Ho hum, she was still excited and happy her birthday had finally arrived! She loved all her gifts, which strangely had manifested into a Hello Kitty theme. After a leisurely morning at home relaxing and SKYPING family and friends, Stella and I spent the rest of the day at Marineland in Nice, which was absolutely fantastic! We had been to the Zoo in Frejus just the day before and was bitterly disappointed. Once you have experienced Tarronga Park Zoo, nothing else can really compare to it, so my expectation was very low when we arrived at Marineland. We had driven past Marineland for a few weeks, on our way to school, and it really didn’t’ look like much, just a big ol’ carpark. But it really was quite magical. There were pools of dolphins and seals, sea lions and penguins, and the acclimatised Polar Bears who sleep in ice caves at night and then swim in their pool in the Medeteranean sun during the day. But the absolutely best part of the whole day, was the last show which was….the Orca Whales! What majestic animals they are….watching them in a colosseum like arena, these mammals just entertained us. As they danced around, flipped and splashed their tails, to Katy Perry (yes, our anthem!) and Kylie Minogue, I wept like a baby, watching these animals interact with their trainers and us the audience, its was amazing! Stella too was blubbering like her mother it was a really poignant moment, It felt like these amazing mammals spoke to us……really it was such a wonderful moment.
Oh well, they'll have a lot of frosting on them anyway, so maybe it won't be so noticeable. I hope it won't. And there are peppermint candy canes at Christmas, right? It's a seasonal thing.

Brad went on to tell me that there are no nesting Osprey at Grant’s Pass. It’s too dry. The area to the east is semiarid and there are no lakes in the immediate area. He said that it was unlikely that the bird I saw was an Osprey but some other type of hawk. And he could not think of any reason why a passing hawk would stop to attack two threatening ravens. By this time the party was heating up and people were pairing up dancing and conversing. Neither Brad nor I wanted to miss out on any opportunities to meet new people so we left the discussion for the birds to pursue something more immediate and fun filled. Brad soon, if not immediately, forgot all about our conversation as he engaged with the party revelers. I stayed and engaged in the fun but could only keep thinking of my adventure.

Another point of grotesque confusion that we need to clear up, is that Boers are not "Afrikaners". None of your co-workers seem to have any understanding of this. All Boers are aware of the systematic subterfuge and distortion of "identity" that has been the result of the makings of the Broederbond and the National Party, based upon the then image of the British imperialist gentleman. This artificial identity was meant to wean away the Boers from their strong identify, from their history, from their nationalism, and thus weaken them.

Daughter #2 started reading at age 3, but I never forced her to either. She just loved words and letters and basically figured it out after watching a few of those Leapfrog videos. (I'm not kidding!! I did not force her nor did I push her!)

I thought maybe I’d just let Dr. Gettleman take charge, but couldn’t do that. There’s a reason I keep telling you to be in charge of your own body. I couldn’t abdicate that responsibility because I was frightened. It was just fear of pain. You see, my mouth is my weak spot since I opened a car door into it when I was 19. Surely, I could figure this out with the endodontist’s help so I wouldn’t have to endure pain.

I was talking to one of the women who schools with me about this blog, and I was telling her that I wanted to leave my kids a bunch of memories of their childhood because, I really have a hard time digging up my childhood. I have a hard time remembering what happened yesterday a lot of the time. Then I said, “I was talking to my mom about being allergic to my rabbits, and she told me she never knew that.” I spent from the time I was 9 to the time I was 15 weekly scrubbing out rabbit cages being so locked up in the sinuses that I couldn’t breathe and I had to medicate. She was the one scrubbing out the hutches with me. How could you forget a thing like that? This is a defining thing in my personality. I have ALWAYS had rabbits, and I have ALWAYS been somewhat allergic to them.” I just don’t want the kids to grow up and say, “Remember those neighbors we had for 10 years, and not remember them.

Keith & I hurried to finish getting ready, and we headed out the door. During church, I noticed that Jensyn’s dress still had a tag hanging off of it. I quickly checked the boys’ shirts, and I discovered that they, too, still had tags on their new polo shirts. Ah well, we made it to church on time, we celebrated the resurrection of Christ, and we helped a neighbor. I guess we’ll chalk that up to a good Easter morning! :)
What else? Saving Face, which is romantic comedy about a Chinese-American Lesbian in New York. No, really. It's surpisingly Woody-Allen-esque, not just because of the New York setting but also perhaps because of the traditions of match-making and interfering mothers which the Jewish and Chinese cultures appear to share. It's funnier than a lot of romantic comedies remember to be and is full of appealing characters.

I have found myself being more patient with others. I am sure this has to do with all the self discovery I am doing as well, but regardless of the source, it feels good. There is one things that I have discovered in my patience: other people are really struggling to be happy. In this struggle, negativity comes out and sometimes is directed at the outside world. Understanding that these people are doing the best they can with the mindset they have (Deepak Chopra) has helped me to be thankful for my journey and not be harsh in judgement of them. They are trying. I am thankful for being thankful.

Everyone else seems to recall 1977 as the year punk finally got a stranglehold on the UK music charts. This in mind, I'm sure I can look forward to each Thursday being a descent into a level of chaos and social breakdown never before experienced, culminating, at the year's end, with that epitome of the punk spirit Mull of Kintyre. Only three chords and talk of setting things on fire? Did anything capture the zeitgeist of that year more than the sight of three people in wellies strolling around in Scotland?

Driving back from the warehouse to the police station, Britten stops at the vacant storefront he visited with Vega in his dream. It looks much the same -- except that the red exclamation point graffiti is missing. When he reaches the station, he learns that Santoro received a phone call from a man claiming to be the Gemini Killer -- a call that came from Britten's home phone. Britten can't explain that he was checking out a building he had dreamed of the night before, and Santoro decides that Britten is the copycat. Captain Harper asks him to hand in his weapon.

On June 1, 2011 Washington, DC's Channel 4 (WRC-TV, NBC) aired a report titled "Trinidad: Real Estate Hot Spot?" The report was a "positive" story on Trinidad real estate and gentrification. Unfortunately, I believe the coverage was inaccurate based on its racial depiction of both new- and long-time Trinidad residents.
After that, I happened to see St. Mae of the Church of No Dead Saints, and we hung out on the ground near the vendor’s room for quite a while, as a number of wonderful people happened by and I was able to spend some time with them. She was in the process of making a deck for the Discordian game “1000 Blank White Cards,” and I not only found out some interesting information about various other people during this, but also made two cards myself: “37 of Imps Vs. Pimps,” and “I’ll Stomp The World And Melt Your Shoes.” That was a lot of fun, and I’m glad I did it.

Later still came the ignominy and deep uncomfortability of a catheter, and blood transfusions, and endless rounds of blood tests and blood pressure tests and heart rate tests, and the shock on my parents' faces when they arrived and saw the state of me. And then once I'd been moved to the gastric ward (it looks likely the culprit was a burst ulcer somewhere inside me, the blood building up in my stomach until my body rebelled and vomited it out) there were days and nights of memorable people and scenes: the quiet efficiency and kindness of the nurses; the young guy in the far corner bed, completely immobile, blinking his only method of communication; the way patients vanished when your head was turned, wheeled off to surgery or to another ward; the man talking to his wife on the phone from his bed, planning their separate Sunday night television viewing, a comforting BBC1 role call of Countryfile, Antiques Roadshow and Secret Britain; the man who, his mind altered with Parkinson's and infected piss, spent one entire night hallucinating that he was in a church, reciting the Lord's Prayer over and over, singing hymns, sermonising about God and Love, convinced that the high ceilinged room was a church hall and the coloured monitors above each bed were stained-glass windows.

Apparently late Sunday evening, overnight, and yesterday morning – things went a bit downhill. Both of their oxygen needs were up (30-40%) and Colton was having a lot more spells. So, instead of weaning their flow – both were brought back up to 3.0L and Colton had his caffeine restarted to try and help with his spells. This was really disappointing news as most times they don’t allow you to start feedings by mouth if they are on more than 2.0L of flow. Now that they’re 35 weeks, we really wanted to start teaching them to feed. I visited with them after work and cuddled with Keltie for a while. I stayed for their weighing and Colton was 3lbs, 14oz and Keltie was 3lbs, 10oz so they have both gained more than 2lbs since birth! Right before I was about to leave, Colton had a pretty bad spell – probably the worst I’ve witnessed. He turned a real dusky / blue color and it took quite a while and intervention from the nurse to get him to recover. That scared the daylights out of me – I just stood there next to his isolette completely stunned. Of course I couldn’t leave after that, so I hung around a bit longer until I felt better about leaving him.

Take the scene where the Avengers are assembling for the first time around the big table. She spends the scene standing in the liminal space between the Avengers and bridge operations. It’s Hill who answers Stark’s questions about the Helicarrier, and then when Fury arrives she keeps her place but her presences slides into the background. The camera finds her a couple times, like when she’s standing behind Thor as he discusses Loki with the rest of the group. It’s a great shot; you could say that Hill is just standing there to add some depth to the scene, to remind the audience where this meeting is taking place, but the way Hill is postured, with her head half-turned away, gives the impression of that liminal space. She’s the only person in the Helicarrier, in that moment, whose focus is split between the Avengers and the Helicarrier, and Smulders does a bang-up job at looking interested without giving off a mother hen vibe.
On a completely different thought. I have 15 friends that are pregnant...not including my friends here on blogger. 15 f'n people who are pregnant...and like 4 that have recently had a baby.

I'm going to be the only person who isn't pregnant or has kids....and I live the life of an old lady...so I don't even have anything fun to show for it. Oh well though, another day another dollar.
Caffeine is capable of modulating the release of positive mood transmitters. A similar study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health showed that men would do well to have at least six cups of coffee everyday to lower their risk of developing prostate cancer by up to 60%. According to the results of the study, even a cup (or three) of café noir would be powerful enough to lower the risk of prostate cancer by 30%. Besides preventing prostate cancer, coffee is also believed to be able to prevent the formation of carcinoma, which is the basal cell that causes most common cancers.

We did a half hour of cardio (my minimum now – I go every day and I absolutely have become obsessed with working out) on a funky crosstraining machine that was part elliptical and part…stair climber? I picked the “Pike’s Peak” setting and about 12 minutes in was seriously regretting it and definitely feeling the burn – but I kept trekking through. It’s SO much more motivating to work out with a friend – we talked the whole time and it flew by. She showed me how to use some of the weight machines, so we ended up staying at the gym for a little over an hour. Afterwards, we went over to the locker rooms and I found out…

So no. It wasn’t like I’d deliberately set out to challenge myself to sound convincing as a woman, though obviously making it convincing is extremely important: if it’s not believable then the story doesn’t work.

I like it when someone thinks something I’ve written is moving. That’s good!

I scoured my endless supply of scrub samples, the kind you get with your Sephora purchases, and used them all up, comparing them in both outcome and ingredients. The ones I liked the most (Kate Somerville’s Exfoli-Kate) had a lot of chemical ingredients in them; a bummer since I was trying to avoid those if at all possible. After I had exhausted my samples, I headed to Sephora – online and in store – to find a good option. I tend to have sensitive skin and wanted samples of the scrubs so that I would know if I would have a bad reaction or not.

So I went on to figure out what kind of premise would match a title DARKROOM. I had some old fashioned photography experience when I was in junior high school, and I remembered how the hairs on my neck and scalp would prickle every time an image would come up under the developing solution in our makeshift darkroom. At first, it looked like a negative, and the people looked like ghosts. Eventually, everything cleared up and looked normal. But I never forgot that eerie sensation.

And just last week, while swimming in the lap lane at the gym, I noticed a young guy slipping in and out of the water, back and forth and back and forth. I couldn't really understand what was going on, but found myself slightly annoyed as he kept on jumping in and out of my lane swimming a little and then getting out. As he repeated this over and over, it became clear that he was trying to race me - only he was getting out of the water mid lap, running along the side of the pool, and then would jump in, swim a few strokes, and finish a hand or two ahead of me. Once I realized that this was what he was doing, I of course turned up my own steam, and wouldn't let him win by simply slipping in the water ahead of me. It came to the point where he was forced to literally jump in almost at the end of the lap, because I was pushing it. From the sidelines, Daughter #1 watched and asked me later what was going on. I explained to her that the young man was racing me and she looked confused. "If he's racing you, how come he's running half the lap?" Good question. The funnier thing was that he looked SO SATISFIED at beating me in the lanes, and I could only think - you're satisfied from cheating?
Since then, I’ve returned to Germany a half-dozen times. Though my uneasiness lingers, each visit has gotten easier. First, the demographics have changed. It’s now 65 years since WWII ended. A sizeable portion of German grandparents have been born after the war.

Abuse is evil, and far too long has (sounds like the Lord of the Rings talk), far too long has the church been blind to these wicked things among us.

Luckily I have library access. So I plucked the book from its shelf and started reading it at lunch today. I KNOW, I know. But within 14 pages I already had so much stuff to write about.

And here’s a tip: whenever I don’t want to cry, I visualize frogs sitting in my immediate vicinity. Little frogs. Big hulking giant frogs. It’s 80% effective at distracting me from sobbing, which is good, because once I get started it’s hard to stop.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the filling is shiny and the center jiggles just slightly when shaken. Remove the pan to a wire rack and cool completely. Use the foil to lift the bars out of the pan and cut into squares. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.

83. Picture Snatcher (1933)
I found this lovely Zimmermann dress in Melbourne while on holidays and was surprised at the time something strapless actually stayed up on me for once. The cut of the dress is very flattering on the female figure too; possibly something to do with the nicely cinched waisted and sweetheart neckline.
Had a 6.5 hour op and only got the last of 4 drains out on friday there.
I saw this theme earlier, in the week and thought what a great idea it was. How many of us ever played hookey in high school? I didn't exactly but did have what was known as a Senior Pass, which meant senior students with high GPA's could take liberties that others couldn't-such as leaving school, writing your own notes to get back into school etc etc. I don't remember every taking advantage of it, well maybe once to write myself a note back in. But today, after reading a couple of emails, I thought I'd love to just be able to pop over and see some dear friends.

At the earth’s poles, when water freezes, the salt doesn’t necessarily freeze with it, so a large volume of dense cold, salt water is left behind. When this dense water sinks to the ocean floor, more water moves in to replace it, creating a current. The new water also gets cold and sinks, continuing the cycle and creating the Global Conveyor Belt.

“Why Caitanya Mahaprabhu says guru more murkha dekhi’ karila sasan? This is sahajiya-vada. He is thinking, “Oh I have become liberated. I don’t require any direction of my guru. I’m liberated.” Then he’s rascal. Why this Gaudiya Matha failed? Because they tried to become more than guru. He, before passing away, he gave all direction and never said that “This man should be the next acarya.” But these people, just after his passing away they began to fight, who shall be acarya. That is the failure. They never thought, “Why Guru Maharaja gave us instruction so many things, why he did not say that this man should be acarya?” They wanted to create artificially somebody acarya and everything failed. They did not consider even with common sense that if Guru Maharaja wanted to appoint somebody as acarya, why did he not say? He said so many things, and this point he missed? The real point? And they insist upon it. They declared some unfit person to become acarya. Then another man came, then another, acarya, another acarya. So better remain a foolish person perpetually to be directed by Guru Maharaja. That is perfection. And as soon as he learns the Guru Maharaja is dead, “Now I am so advanced that I can kill my guru and I become guru.” Then he’s finished.”

But in February of 2010, I’d gone to Lake Titicaca in Peru to join with other shamans and many pilgrims in the reactivation of the Solar Disc. That experience had changed me profoundly. Many years earlier, during my shamanic apprenticeship, I experienced a change right down to the level of the DNA. That was profound. When I came back from Peru, though, I felt like someone who had reincarnated into the same body. I looked like the same person I’d been, but I wasn’t.

Do you have any idea why he is so hard on your oldest child? Is he trying to get him to strive for more, and just approaching it the wrong way? Or does he really feel like your kid just doesn’t do anything right or well? Is he easier on your youngest for being the baby of the family? Or is he truly just preferential? I would try talking to him about his reasoning behind how he treats the children. If you feel like you can’t get through to him, or just need help, look into counseling. Maybe you need someone on the outside to help you both asses where you are at, and how you feel about things. No matter what, I would seek help for your oldest. Suicide is not a joke and should be taken seriously.

The most notable foreign policy achievement of the Coolidge Administration was the passage of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, adopted in 1928 and ratified the next year.

Jansen’s work is yet another example of the power of imagination – to see the world other than what it is. It is intriguing how he moved from idea, to creating these automatons that ‘live’ on the beach, in a space all their own. The question that arises for me is simply this: Do they have substantial cultural and / or scientific value? Then again, the same question can be asked about much in this world that is made. One thing is for sure, Jansen is leaving a legacy. There is much potential in these works living far past is own death, but one day too, we may be walking the beach and see these creatures mangled, writhing in the wind, as they slowly become extinct.

Five years ago, I was beginning my second semester in college. I had finally decided to pursue a degree in elementary education. I probably hoped to graduate and move back to the Headland area where I’d get a teaching job and maybe rent an apartment or house with a friend. However, God had different plans for me. He brought Lee into my life and Lee had been called into the ministry. He also felt God calling him to seminary in North Carolina. Needless to say, God changed my plans. Lee and I have now been in North Carolina for a year and a half. God has shown us both so much during this time. While serving as the youth pastor, Lee has had the opportunity to lead the church in planning an international mission trip. For many years, I have had the desire to go on this type of mission trip. However, I’ve also always had reservations about it. I let fear of the unknown hold me back. God has been showing me recently, though, that his message is for all people in all nations. It is our job to take his message to others, whether it is our next-door neighbor or a person in another country. Jesus tells us in the gospel of Matthew that the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. I have no excuse not to be a worker.

We went to see Dr. Michel for Coco's vaccinations. I got yelled at on the bus on the way there because a woman thought Coco's socks were too tight and were cutting off her circulation. Coco's socks weren't even a little bit tight, as I tried to demonstrate by easily sticking a finger down the side, but it didn't sway her -- I was a bad person and horrible mother and there was no convincing her otherwise. She complained about me to her friend the rest of the ride. This is also known as "just another day on the bus."

However I wasn't really able to connect with the characters, which ultimately hindered my enjoyment. Main character Elizabeth Margaret has always done what is expected of her and is prepared for an internship before going to Harvard and then becoming a lawyer like her father. She would rather be a chef and try new things instead of accepting the life mapped out for her by her grandmother and parents. But she wasn't going to try that until she receives an offer from an aunt she never knew she had to visit for the summer.

It was then I realized that I don't know how to receive gracefully. I immediately want to make things equal. I don't want to be viewed as someone who is ungrateful, and I want to be liked. It's the "good girl" syndrome, which I am learning to recognize. A few weeks later, a childhood friend and her little one-year-old cutie drove over an hour, sat in traffic forever, and finally arrived at my house just to be with me. She knew I was having a difficult time, and I needed a friend. She helped me paint a huge piece of furniture, even though painting is something she really doesn't enjoy. It was a low-key day, but to me it was a blessing, and I still had to learn how to receive gracefully.

If one looks at this subject from the perspective I’ve tried to illustrate here, then one can well imagine why members of a tribe respected and obeyed the Astronomers. The study of Astronomy had also turned these men into surveyors, engineers, architects, planners and builders. Their advice was accurate, or to put it another way – they had proven themselves to be reliable and truthful. When the wise chief said: “See that huge rock standing over there, about 8 miles north? Now go fetch it and put it here in this exact spot!” They listened and obeyed, without hesitating. When the wise men said: “It is time to harvest!” – The people acted without a quarrel. When they proclaimed: “This young lady is 16 years old, and ready for a husband,” it was accepted as truth and the necessary arrangements were made without any fuss.

One interesting thing about Flaxman Low is that like Sherlock Holmes he has a great nemesis, an evil criminal mastermind with whom he is obsessed. Flaxman Low’s Professor Moriarty is Dr Kalmarkane. Rather than being a master criminal Kalmarkane is something much more dangerous, an occult researcher who uses his powers for evil while Low uses his knowledge of the occult for good. Kalmarkane aims to gain unlimited power through the aid of diabolical allies and black magic.

STEVEN: 7th Sigma was born of my love of Rudyard Kipling's Kim, Manly Wade Wellman's Who Fears the Devil?, the place I live (New Mexico), and studying the martial art aikido for sixteen years. As I've said elsewhere I wanted to have the multi-cultural semi-lawless sort of setting that colonial India was and I achieved a little of that in the post-infestation territory. Kim has a semi-vignette sort of structure but Who Fears the Devil? even more so--it was a fix-up, more of anthology, of Wellman's Silver John stories, previously published in magazines. I wanted the chapters to be story like in of themselves. Tor.Com published "Bugs In the Arroyo," a slightly modified version of chapter 15, and "A Story With Beans" is also set in the territory. I have a different story, "Rust With Wings," which takes place in the first days of the infestation appearing in a 2012 YA Apocalyptic Fiction anthology called After edited by Ellen Datlow and Teri Windling.

Well clearly it allows the kids to have their own space, to ask their questions and experience God in their own way. It also allows parents to have some adult focussed worship and teaching themselves. These things are good; great and feeding in fact. So that system should stay; yes. We have the monthly People, Prayers and Potatoes session and that brings families together and I'm sure that's one of the reasons it's popular and working so well. Success, fab. But what about the families that don't access PPP?

It is not usually my style to spend a whopping twelve pounds Sterling of my hard-earned money in order to visit the British Museum’s special exhibition on the Hajj, especially in view of the fact that my knowledge exceeds that of most non-Muslims (I actually venture to say that I know more than most Muslims). The reason I decided to enter the tomb that represents Islam is simply to see what the exhibition organizers were able to make out of nothing.

I’m pretty sure he had rented the room to cheat on his wife.

Finally in June we found a house! Finally a house I loved with everything I wanted and in our price range! It's in West Layton and in the same subdivision as Bobby's brother Scott and his sister Julie. We also are really close to my brother Brady and my sister Tana who live in Syracuse too. We really love it here and we love having family so close by. Annabelle loves being able to have her cousin Mya in her nursery class at church. They have had lots of fun together.
If Mental Health is a product, it’s likened to a newly-launched one; people are at the stage of trying to appreciate its essentiality. Unlike many products out in the market that appear to be mere whims but have overwhelmingly drawn attention, Mental Health is not something that popped to stir a necessity in us. This has been a long-time need to which we have just put a blind eye to.
Charlie Chaplin was the Tramp in almost all his films, so all his films, in some way, dealt with want. His first Depression-era movie, City Lights (1931), was a melodrama; a love story that depended on the poverty of its two leads to set up the gags. It could have been set in 1900 as easily as 1931. But his second, Modern Times (1936) does not present a poor man so much as a poor society, and the gags rely not on the Tramp’s poverty, but on the root cause of everyone else’s.
She wants Amelia to start learning how to dress and undress herself! She showed me that if I pull her shirt half way up and cover her eyes, Amelia will want to tear it off so she can see. Voila! Now she knows how to take her shirt off. She also showed me how get her hands in her sleeves and then have her extend her arms by holding a toy above her head for her to reach. Genius! We also pulled her skirt down around her ankles, which she stepped out of because she could not walk with them hanging around her knees (a lesson lost on some of America's youth and their saggy pants).

I do want us to have plenty of free time and unstructured play. I love that Toddler M will wander towards a bookshelf and sit down with a book. I love snuggling on the couch with both boys at the end of a long day and watching an Elmo movie together.

The food, mostly seafood, was excellent. It was also very bad for a diet with way too much tasty fat. Our daughter, Deb, and I also had a few desserts which were out of this world. Now it will be hard to go back on the diet, but since I lost 25 lbs. last year, I really want to lose more. I’m motivated.
I lay in the darkness, listening to see what he would say or do to convince the dog that life was short and his even shorter if he didn't settle down. Nothing. Complete silence. No yelling. No talking at all, in fact. Nothing but the blissful peace created by absence of noise. I dozed off. I don't know how much later it was but Woody crept back into bed and wrapped himself around me, no doubt to suck the heat out of my body since he felt like a block of ice!

The scenes in the real world balance out the impressive epic-scale battles in OZ. Natsuki and her family struggle to keep everyone together, while Kenji is blamed for causing the whole mess. Even still, Summer Wars never becomes hopeless. What makes it most impressive is how it successfully meshes a technological thriller with family drama. Particularly heartening is when 90-year-old Sakae Jinnouchi picks up an old rotary phone and starts dialing everyone she knows, giving them encouragement and rallying them to help out everyone they can during the crisis.
In the movie, a boy and a girl are chosen, annually, from each district, to battle to the death until one “Tribute” remains.

Whew! Now, where was I? Oh, yeah. One more thing. Women--and I'm talking straight women, not just lesbians--would much rather see a hot female body. When we see an amazingly shaped female, we're blown away because we know what it takes to achieve that, whether it's by disciplined diet and exercise or sheer luck with the gene pool. It's no secret that women look at other women more than we look at men. As I say in my book, I'm not going to learn any beauty tips from a 230-pound rugby player. But they do have their place...
There was one time in the summer when I was out with some of the girls who stayed down in Carbondale with me and I was working at the first bar and this guy with this thick mustache had been my customer the night before. I had served him all night and he was tipping me well, I never led on to anything else, just kept it customer and server because really a mustache is not my scene, and he was like 40. So anyway after we pregame and my friend's house we head to my bar. We are doing shots and getting nice and toasty when another server brings over a tray of shots and says this is from the guys at the bar, they said they knew you.

If I was them I would try and get a refund as the products are not fit for the purpose intended!!!
At which point, the pundits swarmed: Was the women’s movement — responsible for ushering women out of the kitchen and into the workplace — to blame for this happiness gap? Were women themselves at fault for not taking proper care of themselves? There must be something wrong with you if you’re not happy, the media howled. Blame yourself! Blame feminism! Blame your choices! Whatever you do, don’t assume it’s the rational response to life itself or to a workplace that has not changed to accommodate the new reality: though women represent close to half of the workforce, the workplace still operates like a set from “Mad Men”as if the ideal employee is one with Betty Draper at home to take care of business.

The Hull: This is analogous to the case in handguns and rifles, but is slightly different. Modern shotgun hulls are generally made of plastic with a brass base, or "head"; though historically (and currently used in shooting events that recreate historic time periods) they have been made of paper and brass, or even all brass, like a handgun casing.
Advertising regulation in the USA, such as it is, is done nationally by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). As a practical matter, someone has to complain before the FTC will investigate and act.

Having overcome great odds and two near-death experiences the young entrepreneur has continued to bring an eternal optimism and fighting spirit to everything he does. Both will serve this young, burgeoning social network for years to come.

and here's my interpretation ofher sketch, using Dreamweaver's Asian "Love" stencil as my sentiment, with glossy blue embossing paste and Navajo Sky Metallic FX. First, stamped the Impression Obsession image with clear embossing powder on glossy cardstock, then dipped it onto a Non Stick Craft Sheet which I'd sprayed with blue and green Ecoline Inks mixed with water and Winsor and Newton Iridescent Medium mixed in a Ranger Mini Mister. Then I paste embossed the stencil with the blue glossy embossing paste (again on glossy cardstock), removed the stencil, let it dry, then repositioned it and pounced Metallic FX over dabbed-on glue. I really like the sheen that the Metallic FX gives over the blue glossy paste. I cut that with a Spellbinders plain circle die, then mounted it over a blue panel cut with the same die, and white cardstock cut with a Spellbinders Lacey Circles die. I used some gold peel-offs for the corner embellishments. This card is in the post, along with a hand crafted Christmas present, to a long time, dear lady friend, who loves blue and white!

Just imagine that Twitter was shut down by a judge on the urging of a US government department because one user had posted a shortened URL pointing to a page containing a video that offended a copyright holder. What the law is about, in effect, is distributing responsibility for breaches of the law of copyright. At the moment, the copyright holder holds all of the responsibility. What the entertainment companies are saying is: we want the middleman to also take on part of the burden of making sure that the law is not broken.

I’ve been scanning the financial press and broadsheet business sites this morning so far. All of them report the outcome verbatim. Only Damien Reece seems to have a steer on what’s really happened so far.

I don't have a backyard, so I did the next best thing: spend some quality time chilling in a Nolita playground while snacking on Chinatown baozi (prefaced the night before by soup dumplings!). I even later made it to McNally Jackson, my favorite bookstore. (Thanks to Eunsan, my foodie companion, for coming with!) What are your personal comforts?
If you think that they would only know about the famous ones, you’d be wrong. They’d know about the local up and comers too, and they’d have trading cards, like baseball cards, that have their stats printed on the back. You know, like Cavity Assists, Cleaning Time Average, and Drool Handling?
In fact, my loathing of this task was one of the reasons I pitched the idea for the book, What’s for Lunch? in the first place. I was in the shower (where all good ideas flow) and began to wonder what other parents around the world—most of whom live lives far more complicated and difficult than mine— do to feed their children at school.
Last week, Yum Restaurants India-owned Pizza Hut rolled out 4-5 inch pizzas in select markets such as Gurgaon-NCR at entry-level prices of Rs 29 each – that’s the lowest in the Indian market by any player and the lowest for any of 117 countries where Louisville-based $12 billion Yum Brands operates.
This book asks the question: What if the defendants in a certain jurisdiction banded together and decided not to plea bargain, insisting on a full jury trial for every case? It would overwhelm the system. There wouldn’t be enough prosecutors or public defenders or available court dates. Even the defendants who lost would be able to claim ineffective assistance of counsel or the lack of a speedy trial on appeal. The system would be thrown into chaos.

I've packaged and repackaged a hundred times but I'm happy with the final presentation. These will be available in the store (http://www.alifedeliberate.etsy.com/) for $14.00 which is actually a deal because normally three soaps are $15, AND you receive it gift wrapped and ready to give to someone, or just give a little treat to yourself. I've worked really hard on them and I hope everyone likes them. The inside flap has a little graphic and quote because I'm a card-carrying word nerd. :P I'd love to hear your feedback.

In the lacrosse case, the Times failed because of bias—its editors and chief case reporter, Duff Wilson, embraced a narrative that implied it was the paper’s job to bend over backwards to prop up Nifong’s case. But the paper also failed because sports reporters too often are not sufficiently up to speed about basic legal procedure.
Studies have shown that dark chocolate contains certain antioxidants called polyphenols that could help fight chronic inflammation of tissues in the circulatory system, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. One study of Italians showed that people who ate a moderate amount of dark chocolate daily (about 6.7 grams, or about the same amount of 1.5 Hershey kisses, though these are milk chocolate) had lower levels of a protein associated with inflammation.

That is “organic RP” in a nutshell – roleplaying that (1) relates to and is derived from our characters as living organisms, and (2) that forms an integral element of the whole of our guild experience. Ultimately, our guild exists to facilitate shared social experiences. We do that by promoting organic roleplaying, and we also do a mixture of 5-man dungeon PvE content and PvE raiding content. Whatever we do, however, should ultimately promote positive shared social experiences, because, while it is fun to play a game, an MMORPG is nothing without the second “M” – Multiplayer. MMOs, and especially MMORPGs, are about people, and we want to encourage people not just to have fun, but to make friends. We hope that you’ll join us, have a wonderful time, and make some new friends.

So I am not afraid in this (as afraid). I know I will make progress. And after I have done all I can with learning how to make the story stronger, more compelling, (and for God's sake for me to stop taking the conflict and tension out of the story, when I am supposed to be making it more acute) then I will turn my focus on grammar. Actually I am hoping, perhaps foolishly so, that some of those sorts of mistakes will be naturally worked out. That as the story becomes stronger, some of the grammatical problems will get knocked out of it in the process.

Anyway I was in the kitchen doing something and I notice my boys are wrestling in the living room. Nothing major, that happens all the time. But sometimes one will take it too far. My youngest did something that hurt my oldest and instead of understanding that is what happens when you wrestle my oldest got mad and kicked his brother across the room. He literally put both feet on his chest and pushed as hard as he could. I was shocked. I could not believe what I just saw. I had only one response. "GO TO YOUR ROOM!!!!"

A paper of ours (Findlay and Sparks) which is to be published in the Scottish Geographical Journal seeks to consider such changes through an analysis of one such location – Shettleston in Glasgow – developing an understanding of how these changes can be measured and understood. Using a longitudinal survey methodology, data on retail stock, churn, vacancy and use can be analysed. The data show complex dimensions and aspects of vulnerability and resilience, compounded by exogenous retail and other social and economic changes.

The pregnancy is rolling right along. Can't wait to be able to bend over again and move normally. I'm almost 28 weeks, so just less than three months to go! I'm excited to not be pregnant anymore, but terrified of having the baby. I'm worried about finding new child care for them both when I go back to work. Lucy's current babysitter will most likely be moving in August, which is about when I'll be returning to work. I've come to really trust and love Lucy's sitter, and know that she is loved and taken care of so well there. I have no idea what I'll do when Becky's gone. I cry when I think about it too much.

A note on the term “Zebra.” In the context of the NOI’s genocidal campaign, “Zebra” has been considered by many blacks to be controversial, and even racist. They are offended by the term’s black-on-white imagery. The term was employed by the SFPD, because the Department reserved radio frequency “Z” for all broadcasts related to the specific killing spree at hand. Killings were considered a part of the spree that were committed execution-style by a black against a white, using a .32 gun. (Only after Anthony Harris came in, did police discover that the machete killing of Quita Hague was a Zebra killing. Police also did not associate the Hague killing with the Zebra killings that followed it, because Jesse Lee Cooks sexually molested Quita Hague, and robbed the couple.) For clarity’s sake, all military and police organizations use a term for each letter in the alphabet. Thus, when one refers to “A Company,” one instead says, “Alpha Company;” for “B Company,” “Bravo Company,” and so on. One proceeds similarly when reading off a license plate number to a police dispatcher. For Z, one says “Zebra.”
Sworn Serbian enemy, Del Pontae describes Kosovo & Metohia province under the NATO rule as a land with no laws and institutions, the land of blood feuds ruled by the thugs who present themselves as heroes of the alleged "suffering Albanian people".

Obviously, I don't agree with NWF--who claim not to support all of the Scotts products, and see this as a way to work from the inside out in a company that wants to change (so why don't they?). The chemicals we spew on this planet are immense--we really have no idea. From lawns to gardens to big crops, to the feed in cattle and chicken and hogs, to what we put into ourselves and release into the sewers to be "treated" but is never really gone--Tylenol, antidepressants, estrogen, the gmo food we eat.

The Sarah P. Duke gardens are located in Duke University’s West campus area in Durham, NC. They are open to the public and cover approximately 55 acres.

The next hour flew by with fear, sadness, and a cath that was done without my epidural because they started my mag bag, before the C-section. UGH!!! As I was being taken to the OR, I remember Tom leaning in and saying "don't worry I have this!" I knew I could count on him, but I never thought he'd be in the NICU without me for 30 hours to follow her delivery. My c-section went find, in fact they were ready to deliver her and I did not notice they had started. I was sick from the spinal and all I can remember is them saying "dad do you have the camera?, she's here." And then the SCREAMING AND CRYING BEGAN....."thank you, God" I got a quick look and off with the NICU team and daddy she went.
The overwhelming sense is that ‘all this’ just is.

This might not look like much yet, but I'm test knitting the Effie Hunger Games pattern that goes with this yarn, Candy Skein Yummy fingering in Butter Mints! I'm showing you this side, because there's not much to look at yet, as it's just twisted rib. We should be releasing pictures sometime this week (hopefully Thursday!) of the whole sock, but the pattern won't be released until it's finished through test knits. I will say, it's a gorgeous pattern, and though I only assisted in designing it, I'm super proud of it. I can't wait for you all to see the pictures. The designer, Yavanna, will be setting up a project page for it when we do release pictures so that those interested can favorite it for when it is released. I'm hoping to plan a KAL on the Candy Skein Addicts Ravelry group for May/June and will be keeping the Butter Mints colorway around through the end of May. One of the test knitters is knitting it in a kettle dyed Candy Skein colorway (Grape Fizz) and it looks awesome in that, too! Can you tell I'm excited?
I went out about four days ago to feed the chickens. I noticed what looked like spirals out of a standard one-subject notebook, but they were much longer. I asked Frank about them.

The first whiff is a clean, clear rye, much like the standard Sazerac, which yields to just a touch of fruit mixed in to the rye spice. The flavor is what grabs you right away. There is plenty of rye, but with a sweet, fruity note from the dessert wine, very unlike the sweetness you traditionally get from the corn in rye whiskey. Each sip is a mouthful of contrasting flavors - spicy and sweet, dry and fruity, whiskey and wine in perfect balance. The party continues into the finish. It's hard to believe that the few months this whiskey spent in the wine casks is enough to have such a pronounced influence on its character, but it can't be denied.

They should be driven from office, defunded, and chased through the streets like villagers in pursuit of Frankenstein.So the villagers who chased Frankenstein with torches and pitchforks were also being chased? Presumably by other villagers who were outraged that the first villagers' torches -- while smoky -- weren't producing enough chlorofluorocarbons to keep the Danube from freezing.

Did you know that many people are serving Money (with a capital M)? Many of us are desperate to find a job so we can earn money so we can buy food and clothes. Others of us worry that our savings won’t provide for retirement or that we haven’t stored up enough money for an emergency.
This seems highly, highly unlikely to be the case. This is part of the atheist’s dilemma. Who really knows what is right and wrong in the atheist’s system? Who will hold us accountable in the atheist’s system? (One another? OJ proves that notion is laughable.) How will justice be finally ‘worked out’ in the atheist’s system? Worse, where is grace in the atheist’s system? Where is life in the atheist’s system? Are we really to believe that death is the great equilizer?

That's right, just like the death of the sinister puppet Mr Flibble in the BBC programme Red Dwarf the madness is indeed over. That's not saying that the last few weeks have been anything like being chased round a spaceship by an insane hologram with his sinister homicidal puppet. But the surge of relief once the several hundred casks of Red Rye Riwaka were taken away was almost similar to that felt by the characters of Lister and co in those penultimate moments of the quarantine episode of Red Dwarf..

The programme did not qualify as impartial, saying that there was a consensus amongst political parties in the UK about welfare, ignoring the millions of people who are not represented by the main political parties. The programme looked for welfare solutions from the USA, hardly a good example for the eradication of "squalor, ignorance, want, idleness and disease" which was the aim of the Beveridge Report.

Normally I am not interested in reality shows. I find they are a waste of time and usually promote values I have no interest in. Yet I find that for the last 3 seasons I have been drawn to the The Biggest Loser. I am certain that a great part of my interest has to do with the fact that I have struggled with my weight for many years. Just 3 years ago I decided it was time to do something about my enormous 355 pound body. Through prayer, diet, exercise I lost over 120 pounds. Over this last few years I have run several 1/2 marathons as well as completed a full marathon last year. My road to recovery has not been easy but it has been a road that many face. Hence my journey has made me more aware of those who struggle with their weight. Just for fun I thought I would share some thoughts of the good & bad I have found in the Biggest Loser TV show. Let’s start with the good.

Ledia: I wanted to say that he’s always been a really good listener and a good person to bounce ideas off of, including giving us ideas like what to take in college and how to be a good step-parent. And he and my mom have been such nice role models, and they really do have a really, had – It’s hard even to say “had.” I’m going to say “have” – a great relationship. They would sit in the kitchen and cook a lot of dinners and talk about the details of everything that they’ve been doing, and it’s a really nice model of a really nice relationship. And I think that a lot of people don’t realize, too, that a lot of times—they would have a lot of people over for dinner—and that John really cooked a lot, his entire life he cooked. And a lot of the things that I even cook now are things that really are his recipes, all those wine-based French recipes that my friends know about.

One can compare this to flipping a coin. There’s a 50/50 chance that if you flip a coin it will come up Heads. If you flip it 1000 times, you will most likely end up with Heads coming up around 500 times. However, along the way you may have had Tails come up 10 times in a row, which would be similar to a losing streak.
C.B. James said, "I notice there's nothing from Brazil yet. I recommend Keeper by Mal Peet. This is a young adult novel set in a lumber town in the Brazilian rainforest. The hero meets a mysterious man in the jungle who may be a ghost who teaches him how to be a goal keeper. The hero then goes on to become a world cup winning goal keeper. The combination of soccer how to book, ghost story, coming of age story worked very well for me. I found the book hard to put down even though I know nothing about soccer."
I'm halfway through my first semester back at college. I am now officially on spring break. Sort of. I have so much to catch up around the house and so much schoolwork to do over break that it won't seem like much of a break.
After this it was off to Macy's, which used to be the old John Wannamaker's Department Store. First up is the fun A Christmas Carol display which has been in this city since at least the 60s. A few years ago, there was a lovely story in the local papers about how the figures were in dire need of repair or replacement. The original designer of the figures, whom to my surprise was still alive, was brought in to replace the old figures with new ones. The work is amazing and the figures look exactly the same, but in newer condition.

Fortunately for my growling stomach, there’s no need for fancy language in describing TFIOS. It’s beautiful, point blank. By page two I knew I was in love with this book, by page 10 I was rereading paragraphs and by page 25 I was jotting down notes for this review. The novel is accessible and smart without being showy, believable and sad and so surprisingly funny that I’d have just recovered from crying when it would make me laugh, which was so unexpected that I’d start to cry all over again.
At the farmer’s market in River Vale, though the selection is a bit small, the vendors are very friendly and engaging. When we asked if it was possible to get a bushel of tomatoes for our canning adventures, they weren’t fazed at all and told us to give them a call the week we wanted the bushel and they would bring them along. With our tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil (plus other fantastic purchases) we made homemade margherita pizza that might have been one of the most delicious pizzas I ever ate. The freshness of the tomatoes makes a huge difference and makes me wish tomato season came more than once a year! My heart sincerely goes out to all of the farmers whose summer and fall crop were damaged by Hurricane Irene; see how you can help here. Through GrowNYC and Greenmarket, you can donate to help farmers restore their farms and/or choose to take the Locavore Challenge and eat locally for the month of September.. lucky you that I’m writing this on September 1st!

A little suffering is good for the soul – that would appear to be the message of Inferno (1953). It’s a classic tale of man against nature with a liberal sprinkling of deceit, infidelity and murder thrown in for good measure. The movie is generally regarded as a film noir and I suppose that’s fair enough given its themes, although the visuals (technicolor and wide open spaces) suggest it should be the antithesis of that style.

It has been said search and you will find, is this a true statement. Think of a time when you have misplace one of your things, you may note that it sometimes has only been found after diligent searching. Indeed you may have also learnt some valuable lessons like how to avoid losing the item again. It has also been said that when the student is ready the master will appear, this could suggest that once you are ready to receive certain types of knowledge the means of learning that knowledge could become available. You could also say that all knowledge is available in the world all the time, and once your eye can read its language you will understand it.

All of this started about three weeks ago when I had the most vivid dream I was eating barbecue. Of course, I woke up hoping to find my fingers covered in sauce, but no such luck. It took a few days before I was brave enough to tell Kyle about my undying desire to eat some really yummy brisket, but when I finally did he happily took me out for dinner at IronStar Barbeque (a must try if you in OKC) - we even had the good fortune to go with this girl and her husband (who were also happy to humor me and my barbecue craving).

These counterexamples are fallacious. Zionists complaining that Israel is more slammed than Congo is like Tiger Woods complaining that his extramarital affairs are more exposed than his next-door neighbor's. Israel is famous and Congo is not, and if Garrard doesn't like fame to be a fundamental attractor of attention she should criticize human nature, not anti-Zionism. (By the way: so concerned as she is with the Congo genocide, has she ever penned any reflection on how all those Holocaust museums haven't helped prevent other mass killings?).

And we finally see Lucius is going to be in the film. Since none of the previous trailers showed him and the fact Lucius no longer works for Bruce, it makes me wonder how he’ll still fit in.

This past Sunday morning I did a sermon from Genesis 14:1-24. In the sermon, I emphasized that Abram showed his faith in God by his response to the two kings who came out to greet him after his battle. He accepted the blessing of Melchizedek and gave a tithe of all of his possessions. Abram also rejected the offer of the King of Sodom because he did not want there to be any chance that the glory rightfully belonging to God would be given the this wicked king. Abram could have used this opportunity to get rich quick and help fulfill the promise that God had given him, but instead he decided to reject this offer and trust that God would still fulfill his promise in a better way; in a way that would bring God the most glory.

Become aware of it.
In July of 2011 I had the opportunity to photograph someone who was a huge inspiration for this project. After I first got the idea for this portrait project, I spent almost one year thinking about it, but never getting started with it. One morning I was listening to the Forum radio show on San Francisco's KQED public radio station. They were interviewing a lady from Sacramento named Kiyo Sato. Kiyo is former internee of the Poston internment camp.She was discussing her book Kiyo's Story, which described her life growing up on a strawberry farm in Sacramento, CA before the WWII. After Executive Order 9066 was signed by President Roosevelt in 1942, Kiyo was forced to drop out of Sacramento Junior College. She and her family were forced to leave their farm in Sacramento, move to temporary housing at the Pinedale Assembly Center, and were eventually incarcerated at the Poston Interment Camp in Arizona.

The latest film, “The Muppets” (2011) follows Walter, the world’s biggest Muppet fan, his brother Gary (Jason Segel) and Gary’s girlfriend, Mary (Amy Adams), from Smalltown, USA, as they head to Los Angeles for vacation and discover the nefarious plan of oilman Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) to raze Muppet Studios and drill for the oil recently discovered beneath the Muppets’ former stomping grounds.
Baby Brother’s rented infant carrier is due back soon and he’s pretty much too heavy to tote around in it, anyway, so we’re trying to figure out what to buy next. They’re all at least five hundred bucks (all children’s products in Sweden cost a small fortune) and he’ll be in it for years so the decision feels like a really big one. But they’re all super-duper safe at any rate and that is nice to know!
I'm on a break this cycle from my CPIC training, as we were too short for me to be off of calltaking but I'm enjoying the break. I like both positions and really don't care where I sit. It's just last shift there I made a few mistakes which I hate. I'll admit it first, I'm a perfectionist when it comes to myself so I don't really like training. I don't like knowing that I'm not as good as I should be and hate making mistakes. Needless to say it's a stressful time for me because I'm getting more mad at myself then my trainer, actually he's never gotten mad, he's pretty laid back. They are not bad or big mistakes but I'll miss type a code and have to do it all over again or I'll forget which of the several new codes I need. I know it'll take time to do it fluently, I just hate not being there yet. I keep thinking it's not fair to the officers who are used to asking a request say for someones CPIC and CNI and getting it back in within a minute and me who might take two minutes.
This month on Gormandize with A-dizzle and K-bobo I've been experimenting with recreating some delicious and classic Iranian dishes in a vegan friendly manner. It's been such a delicious month and I have to give a huge thank you to the person who requested that I feature Iran - what a great choice!! But now it has come to an end - so here is a recap of the tasty treats featured. I hope you enjoyed the learning journey with me. If you'd like to get in on it and request a country for me to feature then head over to this post. Here is what we ate over the last month:

Given the success of McLarens sidepod mounted solution in 2009 and the safety concerns that dogged the systems introduction, means that teams will probably opt for sidepod mounting of the Batteries and PCU. Especially as to expand the fuel tank area to mount the batteries as in 2009 will create a huge bulky rear to the monocoque. There will no doubt be an aerodynamic penalty to the slightly bulkier sidepods to house the hardware and additional cooling. This needs to be less than 0.3s laptime penalty in order to offset the gain from the power boost. Even with the gains and losses in laptime with a KERS system, teams may opt to run the system simply to use it for an overtaking aid in the race. Off the line and onto long straight the boost might be enough to overtake a rival.

As to when it's ready to go out on submission, unfortunately there's no exact answer. Generally, you will have a gut feeling that it's ready and there's nothing more you can do that's really going to improve it significantly. (You can tweak forever, but there comes a point where you're not really improving anything, you're just messing around.) But here are some things to ask yourself to see if you're ready: Have you told the story you want to tell? Have you created a character we can care about, challenged him/her with something important and relevant, and resolved the problem in a satisfying way? Is every word the best choice you can make for it? Have you read it out loud to yourself, your toddler, your husband, your dog, and anyone else who will listen? Have you had someone who has never seen it read it out loud to you? (Often, especially with rhyme, this is crucial to make sure the story flows well.) Have you had a couple beta readers or critique partners look it over? Is the language lyrical, rhythmic, asking to be read over and over? Does your story have re-readability (i.e. will a child want to hear it many times and will an adult be happy to oblige?) Have you left half the job for the illustrator and given him/her plenty to work with?

That is exactly how I feel today. We got a different car about three weeks ago. Mine was crunched and I didn't want to put the $800 from the insurance into an old car. Anyway, I was running around with the temporary tag and decided to get my new registration a little before the expiration day.

"This is an appalling waste of human potential and a potential source of serious social instability," the Ministry of Higher Education said this month when it unveiled sweeping plans for boosting university enrollment and improving vocational colleges.
Instead of acknowledging that uncomfortable fact in his "fact finding," Judge Berchelmann employs a bizarre term of art, saying the court's internal procedures represented an "oral tradition," not unwritten rules. An "oral tradition" - as though the Court of Criminal Appeals were some Native American tribal council passing down the stories of their ancestors.

The weather has been amazingly good, warm to hot, clear skies and no heavy fog in the evening. I read somewhere that we had the coldest summer since 1975 and I believe it. It also looked like we were not going to get our indian summer. I haven't run since the finish last Sunday but I've been walking around the city, popping into shops and even visited the museum briefly. Apparently indian summers are the norm in the southern Oregon towns of Williams, Medford and Ashland as well. Indeed when we woke up the Monday morning after the race we were greeted by warm temperatures and sunny skies. It was nice and beautiful except for the duration of the race - funny how that sometimes happens. We rolled into Williams under gray skies, in fact it started raining while we were there. David's iphone showed the system that was on top of us, nifty things these iphones but I didn't need to see that, I had already packed for rain anyway and was ready for the worst. I had brought an extra pair of shoes, three extra changes of drymax socks, Vaseline petroleum jelly that I painstakingly scooped up and packaged into tiny ziplock bags, my trusty Marmot shell tucked in my Nathan pack that I planned on picking up at mile 67 and the pocket in one of my water bottle holders held a needle and anti-biotic for - foot care, warm wear, anti-chafing paraphernalia and blister aid.

So why is such a misleading picture being painted? Well first of all I think I have to point the finger at my profession. Quite a lot of bad social research is done, and people draw conclusions from their research that really it is not fair to draw.You're preaching to the choir there, sunshine.

Well, after a difficult week and a raccoon loose in our attic, Interview # 2 was completed today! Yes, after investigating noises late at night in our attic, I found out that a raccoon is living up there. You don’t even want to know the price tag for trapping a raccoon, cleaning up and disinfecting it’s waste and repairing the damage it has done. Anyways, in better news, we had our one on one interviews with our Social Worker, Melinda, and it went very well! I think we spent more time writing our biographies than we did answering questions about them. She mostly wanted to know a few more details about significant events in our lives and about our family relationships. She will schedule the next interview as soon as we have all of the training completed. I still have 5 more modules to complete on the 10 hour course. Holmes still has half a book and the 10 hour course to go. Also, we have to attend the international adoption training seminar in Birmingham before she can continue the homestudy. Please pray about this. The next seminar isn’t scheduled to happen until May 25th. Melinda is going to request special permission to see if she can go ahead and schedule our 3rd interview with a commitment from us to attend the seminar or else she is going to see if there is some online webinar we can take. If she can’t get special permission and if there isn’t an online video, our home study will be delayed by almost 2 months. Please pray that they will work with us on this since we don’t really have any alternatives. Good news, Lifeline, our agency, will be partnering medically with several more orphanages in China starting in April and will be sending teams from UAB to personally assess the health of the children in the orphanages and assist with creating medical files for those children. In June they will be partnering to help adopt those children to waiting families!
She tells me every day what a great mom I am. It doesn't matter if I'm having a grouchy day, or if I'm having a lazy-don't-want-to-move kind of day. (Trust me, I've had several loser-mom days during the last couple months of this pregnancy!) She always tells me I'm the best. And she never forgets me in her prayers. It makes me feel so loved.

It was a full four years before I eventually ventured briefly into a shopping mall again on foot, and almost a full ten years before I was able to stroll through a mall from one end to the other on foot. Even now, I have to carefully consider my footwear and stamina when planning to go to a shopping mall. Often, I strategically plan to visit one shop, parking near by it to cut my walking distances. After treatments several years ago with infusions of the biologic drug Rituxan, my lupus never returned to its earlier severity. Although it has been many years since I had to do my Christmas shopping from the seat of a wheelchair, I will still never forget the adventure of my first rolling shopping trip!

You’d think that movies would have been based on it, but you’d be wrong. There is a move afoot to make a movie about the killings, only with a black policemen-hero, in inspectors Gus Coreris and John Fotinos’ stead. And that “hero” is not Insp. Rotea Gilford, but rather a politician named Ed Sanders, who via Officers for Justice made it all the way to chief, but who made no contribution that I could find to the Zebra investigation.

i think my migraine came about from a mix of stress and hormones. stress because i was setting up my son's new laptop and there was a bit of a hiccup trying to get it to recognise our wifi connection. the wifi on/off switch didn't get any reaction at all. after what seemed like forever, i magically did something that finally had it recognising our wifi again....just don't ask me what i did because i have no idea myself. i can tell you there were many screams of frustration and possibly a few tears during the whole debacle and, of course, a migraine. i was not well today either thanks to migraine fall-out but, by the end of the day, i was feeling much better.

In this piece (not a great pic I realize) I have hidden symbols and images alluding to the struggle that is involved in finding one’s center (including the four directions). I suppose it’s a bit feminine in nature, but I almost called it finding the warrior’s center because I did feel a bit like a warrior trying to fight my way to freedom from all my worries. The center is calm, but finding it is not easy. To all my creative comrades soldier on!
Moral of the story is… it’s strange how things that come up in your life can trigger SUCH INTENSE feelings whether they are love, hate, disregard, sadness, regret, remorse.. anything. Can’t change the past but at least it gives you a heads up for the future. But that puddle of water that’s supposed to reflect back to me and show a clear pretty vision of myself or beyond? NOPE, still dirty. Lack of sleep will make your brain twist things around so if you’re not understanding my metaphor you can shove it. =D
My paternal grandmother was Italian and always made her own sauces, which I almost always do as well. Tonight I wanted to experiment and try something different.

I’ve been spending a lot of time on my back porch lately. The cooler weather makes the screened porch a perfect place for me to reflect and pray. I love to sit out there and write enjoying the sounds of the birds singing and watching the squirrels hop through the yard. It is so peaceful. I find myself daydreaming about how I would love to improve the back yard. I’d love to plant roses along the back fence. There is a lot of painting to do. The workshop needs some repair. I spend time thinking about what I would do if I only had the time and the money. The task seems overwhelming but I have to start somewhere, so I decided to start on the porch.

Abstract: The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Office) amends its regulations on information disclosure statement (IDS) requirements and other related matters to improve the quality and efficiency of the examination process. These changes would enable the examiner to focus in on the relevant portions of submitted prior art at the very beginning of the examination process, give higher quality first actions, and minimize wasted steps. This action would make the following changes relating to submissions of IDSs by applicants: Impose a requirement for the personal review of, and to provide information about, certain citations; eliminate the fees for, but permit only timely, IDS submissions; and only permit the filing of an IDS after the mailing of a notice of allowance if a claim is admitted to be unpatentable and a narrowing amendment is also submitted. The Office would also: permit third parties to submit prior art up until the mailing of a notice of allowance after application publication; no longer permit an IDS to meet the submission requirement for a request for continued examination (RCE); permit, after payment of the issue fee, certain amendments and petitions so applicants will not have to file a continuation application or an RCE for such items; and revise the protest rule to better set forth options that applicants have for dealing with unsolicited information received from third parties.

First there was the broken nose from falling up the school stairs when she was only 3 years old; then there was the split lip that required stitches that happened in the school hallway and 'nobody saw anything'; then there were the two broken front teeth that happened on the bus and "'we're so sorry, that camera wasn't working that day"; then the day she came home without her g-tube and "nothing happened here, we're sure of it" (until the next day when the g-tube was found on the playground); then the catscan that was needed because she tripped over a rug on top of carpet in the classroom and fractured her eye socket bone; then the cut to her head that required two staples caused by "Ashley did that to herself"; and then all the bruises to her arms and legs that look suspiciously like fingertips.
