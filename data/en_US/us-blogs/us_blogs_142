Today the radio newscaster reported California's Democratic governor announced negotiations with the minority Republicans had collapsed. The Republicans continue to rigidly refuse to allow a needed four of their number to join Democrats voting in favor of an election voting initiative. The proposal would give the voting public the opportunity to select which one of several actions we would choose to address our state's extremely serious budget deficits. None of the choices are desired but some action must be taken. I wonder about the allegiances of those politicians who don't want to let the people decide by vote where we would accept needed budget cuts.

For my card today, I chose to work the inviting wreath image from JB-09775 From Our House. Next, I pulled out a couple of my favorites -- a great sketch (Karen's Sweet Sunday Sketch #85) and new pretty paper (from Basic Grey Jovial). I stamped the wreath 3 times and colored it with Copic markers and Spica Glitter pens. I also stamped and colored the border, cut it out like a frame and popped it on top of the center image (the center image is double popped for more dimension). I added a couple of layers of holly punched edges and some stitching.
Sherry, if you should happen to land here on my blog, thank you so much! I cannot express in words what I feel in emotions. Getting a peek inside of how your brain works was so much fun!!! Letting us "play dress up" with some of your amazing collars was inspiring! Your kind remarks about my necklace was so, so touching. I'm humbled, flattered and sincerely grateful. I very much look forward to sharing classroom space with you again.

Our first few days in Arua, Uganda were transitional and challenging. I was still trying to figure out what happened in S. Sudan, emotionally and spiritually, and how my heart could feel so greatly for a people I knew so little. I suppose it was a means of attempted protection or something, but in those first days I convinced myself there was no way I could “feel” so strongly again, especially so soon, and therefore probably wouldn’t get as attached to the people in Uganda as I had S. Sudan. So there it was, I had my
I do not know where I will go with this today. The most exciting thing that I have done this past week was a doctor and a dentist visit! For excitement, you would think I could do better than that! I tried to pad my excitement account with a visit to the nursing home. I have a new friend who is a patient across the hall from my sister and she is a delight to visit. She is past her 100th birthday, her mind is in better shape than mine, she is always in a cheerful mood, and she likes me! I always leave feeling exhilarated from my visit with her. She and my sister both accept their confinement with such courage and contentment that it is a pleasure to spend time with them. My aunt is there, too but she has trouble hearing me so that makes a conversation much more difficult. My elderly friend quoted a scripture to me the last time I was there “about God’s mysterious ways his wonders to perform” and said it was certainly a good thing she fell and broke her arm, resulting in her stay at the nursing home, or she would have never met me! What a way to build someone’s ego! Whenever I feel let down and alone, it is a real treatment to visit with her and it fills my day with magic moments. It is a pleasure to fill her request for me “to be sure and come back”!

"You saved his life!" I told him, "If you hadn't heard him whimpering, we never would have been able to find him and he would have drown! He was barely able to keep his head above water when I found him and probably had been dog-paddling for the entire 30 minutes that we were out looking for him. That's why he was whimpering intermittently; he could only whimper when his head was far enough out of the water to do so!"

This game was just a shame to lose. It was very well played by both teams. The game was tight until 14:54 of the 3rd period. That's when the game unravelled on the Rangers. Rick Nash took a bad angle shot from BEHIND the red line over in the right side corner. Henrik Lundqvist was pressed against the goal post for the shot. But somehow the puck still found it's way through Henri's left leg and trickled into the net.

This post is part two, a sequel to the first article I wrote last April on outdoor art, Bike Inspired Outdoor Art: Vancouver. This sequel was prompted by John Steil’s impromptu photo contributions for two art works not found in his book on outdoor public art, Public Art in Vancouver: Angels Among Lions. The first art ‘piece’ is a temporary whimsical grafitti response to a bike lane –a perky mouse perched over the saddle and handlebar bike pavement stencil at Pendrell and Cardero St. in Vancouver. A brave little icon coinciding with the larger spirited consultation and public discussion on the Hornby St. separated bike lane at this time.
He dug out a giant circular moat (a time-tested invasion deterrent) to surround the $10.9 million home, built one road leading in and out of the home, put up a heavy metal gate, and installed regular and infrared cameras along the road and around the house. “In particular, I bought the property because it was on the side of a canal, which also provides protection” says Sieger.

A standard .308 Winchester cartridge loaded with a 150 grain bullet (manufactured by PMP – Piet Maak Patrone) has a muzzle velocity of anything between 750 and 852 meters per second, depending on the amount of gunpowder loaded in the cartridge and also the barrel length of the rifle. At 200 meters the velocity would have dropped to anything between the region of 600 - 700 m/s. The striking energy required to produce a casualty, according to Military Handbooks, is 78.6 Joules (58 ft lbs). Let’s presume the bullet in this case was travelling at 670 m/s the moment before impacting with the first buck. The energy carried by the bullet at that point in time would have been roughly 2188 Joules. If we presume that half the energy was used after impact with the first buck then we’re looking at a remaining energy of 1094 Joules, --- enough to cause a second casualty. If another half of that energy was used up after the second impact, it would leave us with 547 Joules (404 ft lbs) of energy, --- more than enough to cause a third casualty! So from a ballistic-scientific point of view the story appears to be true!

Army Capt. Charles R. Barnes of Philadelphia, Pa., will be buried May 2, in Arlington National Cemetery. On March 16, 1969, Barnes and four other service members departed Qui Nhon Airfields bound for Da Nang and Phu Bai, in a U-21A Ute aircraft. As they approached Da Nang, they encountered low clouds and poor visibility. Communications with the aircraft were lost, and they did not land as scheduled. Immediate search efforts were limited due to hazardous weather conditions, and all five men were list as missing in action. From 1986-1989, unidentified human remains were turned over to the United States from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (S.R.V.) in several different instances. None of the remains were identified given the limits of the technology of the time. In 1993, a joint U.S.-S.R.V. team, led by the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC), conducted investigations in Quang Nam-Da Nang, and Thua Thien-Hue Provinces. They interviewed a local Vietnamese citizen who supplied remains and an identification tag bearing Barnes' name, which he claimed to have recovered from an aircraft crash site. In 1999, another joint U.S.-S.R.V. team interviewed additional Vietnamese citizens about the crash and they were led to the crash site. In 2000, a joint U.S.-S.R.V. team excavated the site and recovered human remains and material evidence. Scientists from the JPAC and the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory used circumstantial evidence, and forensic identification tools such as mitochondrial DNA -- which matched that of Barnes' sister -- in the identification of the remains.

Here is an excellent, excellent example of a very visual mindmap. It is about the life and times of William Shakespeare. PLEASE, do go look at it. You will love it, and you will gain a good understanding of a visual representation of an outline. It is fantastic, but I couldn't copy it here. It reminds me so much of the great comics Ben used to draw.
This is what I loved and hated most about the story. Emily Brontë created a character, that I hated so much I almost couldn’t continue reading. Heathcliff is often referred to in the story as a devil, and I can’t find a better word to describe him. He is an egocentric sociopath, who destroys the lives of people to amuse himself, even that of his own son. His excuse for all that is his obsessive love to Catherine and that he couldn’t have her. It is amazing how much you can hate a character in a book.
I also take issue with the fact that one of the professors overseeing the study notes that this is one of the first "nonpartisan" studies to compare school, homeschooling, and unschooling, when as Wendy Priesnitz points out, an academic institution, using the tools and criteria of an academic institution, is reviewing academic institutions (like schools), it's hardly nonpartisan.

Second, I did not go for the story. It did not flow for me. Leo, the astronaut, is a cynical loner like George Taylor, but when he crashes on the planet and sees the humans used as slaves, he immediately opts to lead a rebellion. I thought Taylor’s complete self-interest was more plausible. For whatever reason, the bleeding heart routine of Ari was too much for me. I preferred Zira’s slow realization that humans had value. The confrontation between the humans and apes did not strike me as epic as the original film, either, although it was meant to be even bigger. Further proof less is more.

The night before the luncheon, I got home at 11:00, only to find out that one of my boys, who was supposed to help serve the next day, didn't have the required long-sleeved white shirt he thought he did. The one he assured me he had three weeks ago. Indiana bought him one first thing in the morning. He looked a little wrinkled, but he had a white shirt.

During the terrible, 3-day battle, the 20th played a critical role by holding Culp’s Hill against a Confederate attack from the rear.

The poor paladin, had been missing all night. Sure he broke the impasse of the legendary door –nothing to shake a stick at (though they tried that, along with bribing, bluffing, and intimidating the door) but as for combat, the only thing the paladin hit all night was that first dusk dog. He was slowed, slipping and stumbling amidst the books as he tried to make it upstairs. He even missed on his epic daily power that had only the weakest of effects on a miss. In short, he was pissed.

So it is a film more or less stuck on the North and South sides of Koreaduring the war, and shows us vivid scenes from the POV of both. No one particular person or group is shown to be right, that is, the actual good guy vs. the bad guy scenario. Even the sharpshooter from what I think is the North side, the one they call Two Seconds (because you take a bullet and hear the crack of the gun two seconds after that), who actually happens to be a girl. I’m not entirely sure on the accuracy of that, given the rather male-dominated society of Korea, but hey, maybe they saw it like Israel does – use whatever advantage in war you have. So there’s this particular hill out there on the hotly contested border between North and South, and even while peace negotiations are supposedly being debated, the Hill is still a point of contention and both armies want it. That damn Hill has been taken and retaken by both sides for so long, matter of fact, that certain companies of the North and South armies have started this odd little tradition – in a bunker under the Hill, they leave things for eachother buried in the floor – photos, letters home, alcohol if you’ve got it, matches, smokes, even pranks. In the beginning this leads to the happiest moments of the movie – hey, I’m alive, they enemy hasn’t gotten me yet, and here, they left me some matches so I can have a smoke. Cool. Unfortunately it’s those same few celebratory moments that hurt the worst towards the end, when peace has finally finally been declared after three long years of nothing but endless fighting, that make the final battle for the ownership of that damned Hill that much worse. When you now know your enemies name and have shared a drink with him, at least in spirit if not in deed, seeing a Hill literally mounded of his dead is just the worst.
Today turned out to be an amazing day for my mom. She received a wig from a well-known local hairstylist who specializes in helping those who lose their hair from cancer. My mom loves her wig and it looks fantastic on her. She was able to obtain one that held that special "salt and pepper" color, similar to her natural hair. My mom is ecstatic because her natural hair was becoming very thin, and the wig is nice and full. She says that she will continue using it even after chemo and when her hair grows back!

How is it done? The screws are screwed into the bottom of the shoe and it is the head of the screw that is visible, and it is the head of the screw that provides the traction. Hex-head sheet metal screws are used, because they have many "cutting surfaces" that grip the ice. After some initial misadventures with using screws that were a "tad" too long, I found out what many others had realized. By using #6 or #8 screws that are 3/8 to 1/2 inch long, you strike a balance of having screws that would not only stay in place, but they are not be felt by your feet. Usually, ten to sixteen (or so) screws per shoe, does the trick. Matt Carpenter has a great "how to" description of the procedure on his site. There is also a direct link to his site at trailnerds.com.

This means that sometime between now and 2015 or so, we are very likely to experience changes almost greater than our ability to imagine: a physical pole shift, along with a consciousness shift into the fourth dimension. The exact date, according to the Maya, will almost certainly not be December 21, 2012; rather, it will happen sometime in this seven-year window.
Remove from oven when nice and golden brown. Let cool, at least slightly!

Maybe I’m a little bit wacky, but I would think being sterilized against your will might net you a little more than $50,000 considering the mental and emotional anguish, potential health dangers, and wrecked future you’d get from it.
5. I feel personally insulted. You have no idea who I am, what I've lived through, or what I've accomplished. You don't know the first thing about me. You should consider that when you question my methods and decisions.
For me, remaining inspired requires being honest, growing personally, feeling passionately, and having adventures. It generally requires a deep and vibrant experience of music, poetry, sensuality, and/or love. It absolutely requires continually becoming the person I want to be, at risk of facing fears, disappointing people, and breaking with convention.
Despite the law on bail which clearly gives powers to police and magesterial courts to grant bail u/s 437 (1) (2) to released on bail ”if such person is under the age of sixteen years or is a woman or is sick or infirm: “ However, in the case of Seema neither did the Investigating officer of the case, who could have released her on bail, nor the magisterial court nor the District court granted her bail. Although she was a fit case of bail at all levels as she can neither escape, nor influence witnesses nor tamper evidence, which are the three dimensions that need to be examined when bail is granted.
So on this Wednesday evening Delia is not at home, Summertime Cottage, where a disgruntled Raymond is glowering alone at the Nine O'Clock News presenter. Delia is at Mr Plummer's. Mr Plummer, Oswald, is choir-master at St. Margaret's.
If we recall the agricultural revolution which changed the face of Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the prime effect of the investment in new means of performing agricultural tasks was to emancipate labour from the often back-breaking seasonal tedium of physical labour on the land, but its economic effect was to enable land to be husbanded and crops harvested through the use of a smaller labour force, not a larger one. Redundant labour, an impoverished drain on charitable resources in rural areas and without alternative prospects for work, drifted to the cities.
Anyway, I went with Jamie Oliver’s pizza dough recipe, which, as he says, can also be used to make bread. It was really easy, and it worked with these really simple instructions. Mum was watching me make the dough, and she had some more complicated instructions - based on many years’ experience making bread – but, somehow, these straightforward instructions worked out just fine.
I love linky parties! What a great way to find new blogs and make new bloggy friends!!!!

Trial by Fire - Agatha approaches the stake and tells Jonah that it is heathens like him that try to corrupt the children, she tells the kids to gaze upon the scarred face of evil and then she whispers under her breath "Don't ever think I forgot you, Jonah Hex."
AND FINALLY, THIS. We often bash the overuse of media by kids. Now comes a study concluding that "Both boys and girls who play video games tend to be more creative, regardless of whether the games are violent or nonviolent..." The write-up, however, only notes the correlation between the two; no cause-and-effect relationship is implied. Find out more.
“There are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark’s Eve,” Neeve said. “Either you’re his true love . . . or you killed him.”
For time:
Be upfront about your budget, there is a misconception that telling an architect or Builder how much you have to spend is a bad idea. This is absolutely not the case Without the right advice it’s easy to spend a lot money without adding any real value. A good architect will advise clients where best to invest in their homes and will always endeavor to recommend ways to save money and keep the job within budget. Popular TV shows have painted a different picture reciently but I guess that makes for more exciting viewing. But do make sure you set aside a sum of money for any unplanned issues that might arise.
painting and creativity would be in my daily life and even less my business until not so long ago. I believe that nothing happens by coincidence and so that I do have powerful messages to share through what I create. I am a Mixed Media artist because my heart and soul need to play and discover all the time and Mixed Media allows me to mix and match techniques and materials.
For my card, I chose to go with the "boy" theme and made another lego (tm) card:

Themes & Things: An unusual theme in an assassin novel is body image, but that's what we have going on here - Ismae is deeply ashamed of the mark that covers her, a "deep red stain that runs from my left shoulder down to my right hip, a trail left by the herbwitch's poison" -- the evidence that her mother took poison to abort her. This mark signals that she is one of Death's children, as the children of Death are disturbingly hard to kill. As Ismae grows in strength during her training, she begins to see her body differently - and eventually take not just pride but pleasure in it.
My friends on the jukebox don’t mind if I sing along
Of course, when all those editors were fired, and humor was suddenly seen as an expensive luxury, my freelance jobs dried up. Sadly, I no longer had places where I could go and pretend to be a writer.
Like the name suggests, surrounded by the luxurious dresses for occasions like prom and weddings as well as lingerie, Champagne & Cupcakes also presents a tray of cupcakes in the middle of the store. But don’t let that fool you, as they’re only for display. As for the dresses, prices can be up to $200 and custom-made dresses are available starting from a $250 price.
The Twin Dilemma is a bit of a throw-away story. It is more enjoyeable than some fans make out, but it is rather weak and badly plotted. Some of the dialogue is quite poor.
I am now scheduling a 1 month tour for Echo Falls by Jaime McDougall
It was from the memory in France she couldn't forget.

K, so we have been pretty busy. Jeff took a contact job with the great guys who he met when were in TN. Now these guys have given him the opportunity to do some great work and write a bit in corporate speak. What that means for us is two fold (or more) : First, it means we get to be here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest as a *family* at home for a few more months without worry. Second, it means we got to go to San Diego with him and see our peeps down there. So this month has been jammin' with thoughts and work and ideas and activities.
I went on my first Haunted Tour when I lived in Savannah, GA. That city is chock full of spooky stories and very rich in history. However, the ones offered in Savannah are drinking tours and let's face it, by your third drink you are likely to believe in anything. I used to go on those with friends for fun but never "experienced" anything or took them seriously. It was just something to do.
Recently, plans have been aired of remaking Zanjeer by the Amit Mehra, the son of the director-producer Prakash Mehra, who’d come up with the original version. However, while Mehra would not have had any difficulty in obtaining rights over scripts etc., what irks Akhtar is the fact that his permission as the writer had never even been sought, nor was he even notified of the fact that somebody now wishes to modify what he’d once gone to great lengths to create. That is something which he feels should not be allowed to happen.
Another man called and asked if he could rent a car in Dallas.
I hope that your preparations for Christmas are well advanced and that you can take it easy over the last few days.
The inhabitants of the city rebelled against this plan and have finally won this battle. A 12-kilometer park was built through the heart of the city. The residents of Valencia have paid for a few years extra special tax, so the park could be build by several landscape architects from bridge to bridge.
To get out of that cycle so that his physical desire is channelled towards you again is often a very long process. Understand that from the outset. This is not going to be an easy road, but it is one you can travel together.
I’ve spent so much time learning to spread my wings and trust them to keep me in flight that I’ve forgotten what it’s like to have them clipped. Now that I have experienced freedom and have begun to live into my gifts and calling, I can’t go back to the way things were. I can’t go back to being satisfied with being in the background, watching and listening as the men lead, accepting their leadership without question, following well.
On the whole, I found this to book to be a good read, though maybe a little dark. At least I didn’t encounter many of the things that bother me with some other books. Also, I found the premise to be intriguing as I said earlier.
By contrast, the Man on the Street (MOS) has taken little notice. In the wake of Mount Merapi’s first eruption, that killed on the order of 100 people, it was barely a topic of discussion here in Jakarta. In some cases, there was even a somewhat gleeful attitude exhibited by one person in Jogjakarrta (about 12 kilometers downwind of Merapi), as she described the excitement there. By the third and fourth explosions, and with heavy ash falling on Jogjakarta, the tone finally turned towards concern, but still the MOS here hardly raised an eyebrow. At least so far.
Put the lid on the jar and shake well until blended. What you have is a fantastic dressing for a fancy salad or just lettuce alone. So good you could drink it! I used an orange or tangerine that looks more like a blood orange that I bought at Wal-Mart. I can't remember what the label said they were but it said they were supposed to have the hint of raspberry with a blushed skin. Whatever they are, they are really good but not neccessary for this recipe. It works equally well with a lemon, tangerine or orange.

As Congressman Conyers implies, majority-Afro cities tend to elect majority-Afro city governments. As the average Afro is less well-endowed than other ethnies in future-time orientation, commonweal-orientation, industriousness, and logical aptitude, majority-Afro governments tend to govern poorly.

Krystal kept waiting for Shannon to change the conversation to that other topic. However, it was clear her friend was afraid to bring it up.
2:31am Tuesday morning: Contractions got painful and I felt like I had to get up and go sit on the yoga ball. I stand, take two steps around the bed, and... gush... I gasp, tears come to my eyes, I say "Honey, my water just broke!" and I run to the bathroom. My heart was racing! I didn't expect to be in the 10% of women whose water breaks before active labor but, go figure, I was! I thought the amniotic fluid I saw looked a little green-tinged but I was too excited to care, we were having a baby!!!
Why Nuclear Experts Are Calling Fukushima a Ticking Time-Bomb
We have a problem with a tube under the kitchen sink, which is leaking and it was all wet under the sink. I took out the bin and the cleaning stuff which was in this kitchen unit and put towels in there to absorb the water. In the middle of the night I woke up because somebody rumbled in the kitchen. When I looked I found the bin laying on the floor and its content was spread out all over the kitchen floor !
“Sure thing, boss,” Tattletale answered him. I couldn’t bring myself to reply, and stayed quiet instead.
It still doesn't work because it fails to entice me to read on. You tell me it's funny, but there's not a drop of humor here to show me that's true. You tell me it's got twists and turns but you don't show me a single one.
"Outpatients must enter and leave the hospital with difficulty, while hospitalized patients bear the weight of the threat of mosquitoes after the rain," said 50-year Pushpavanam, a cook whose husband was admitted to the hospital.
I doubt though that Chiplin was a Trotskyist. If he was a member of the Communist Party of Australia in the mid-1950s he would have had to display absolute loyalty to the party line which was very much oriented to Stalin and the USSR a that time. This is an image from The Hobart Mercury, it shows Chiplin being escorted from a court during proceedings of the Royal Commission into Espionage.
We want to discern the wheat from the chaff, so that if and when our MPs decide to screw us later, we can turn around and call them out for the liars and chumps that they are.
﻿Thursday, we saw the rest of the sites. In New York, New York, there was a Statue of Liberty made out of Jelly Bellys! And the biggest box of Nerds I have ever seen. I was going to buy a box, but my bag was completely full. You can see and do almost everything in Las Vegas! I had two of the best meals I have ever had before in my life! Unfortunately, I didn't win a dime. I'm not a gambler, but I had fun people watching. I learned a lot about my job and got to have a good time.
This is one field of energy that everyone is tapped into. You might feel like an individual with your individual life, and activities however, as an individual you are always picking up the energy signatures of others, especially within families. This might offer you one of your greatest challenges as you transform any dense dysfunctional memory or emotion generated with your core family. We invite you to consider this as an awesome opportunity rather than something you cannot deal with or change.

Hated it.
That looks like a great Spring Break trip! When I was in college, I mostly traveled home for Spring Break since my family was in Southern California and I was going to school in the Midwest. I wish I would have gone on a girls' trip like Mallori though!
It had echo, reverb, and pitch shift. I would pitch shift an octave lower, and play along with the bass for a song. Or pitch shift an octave up, and make “music box-sounding” guitar. It was great fun. But it was even more fun when plugged into a microphone! We pitch-shifted our voice at least an octave lower, and called the kid’s number from his lost organizer. It was an answering machine.
So many questions, I guess that I'm really trying to over-think this way too much.

Okay, I'll stop. In truth, Mr. Brooks is a work of stupid genius, and it's completely fucking hilarious. It's not just bad, it's insane, and begging for some MST3K treatment like nothing I've seen since perhaps Mindhunters. But to be serious for a moment, I must admit I'm relieved to know that I am exempt from being stalked and killed by Mr. Brooks by virtue of the fact that I don't own a vacuum cleaner.

From last year-end onwards I had been starting to have my own problems with Penny. Problems I may not have blogged about because, well really, how could I have fully conveyed the angst of the sales ledger reconciliation, the grief generated in the posting of deferred income, never mind the full horror of the great year end reserves reconciliation debate of 2010.

We hope to have a very special guest on to talk about happiness and what it is exactly and we’ll preview an upcoming exhibition which deals with the theme.
No packing away early tonight for me though. I have a project on the go that I need to get finished!!
Do I walk in darkness or the light?
Good luck and have a fabulous Friday!
I'd say that there were at least 150 people at the talk - a number that any bookseller would be very happy with. Even the largest city centre stores struggle to achieve figures like that, so it's remarkable that an independent bookshop in a small Sussex village attracted such a good turnout.
The hens roam free around the garden during the day, a surprising sight for someone walking by on the sidewalk. “Chickens really need space. To be healthy and happy I think it’s really important for chickens to be able to run around,” says Ayer. The coop is at the back of the garden, where the chickens go to roost and nest.
Why the Future will be Much Better Than You Think is a masterwork of this approach. The first four chapters are equally split between outlining their argument and making the case for all the neuro-scientific and cultural reasons why you, the reader, are going to want to disagree with it. They explain how we as humans are pre-programmed to be pessimistic. Add in all the bad news that the media feed us and the way our amygdala (part of the brain) processes fear much faster than other parts of our brain can compute “not as bad as you think.” Our cognitive and behavioral biases are all set to “things are bad and getting worse.”
We wish Black Block every success whilst in its temporary locations and look forward to welcoming it back to Palais de Tokyo in March 2012 once the building works are complete.

I went to the Flaming Lips show Friday night. My level of busy-ness in recent weeks and the threat of nasty weather caused me to be less than stoked for this show.
This is merely describing personality. In which case animals too must have a soul as animals often display personality traits. My own cats are a prime example. Tai is very timid and jumpy, where as Rio is aggressive and violent. My previous cat Zero was laid back and relaxed. Three completely different personality traits. Some people may say this is just the animal's instinct. If this was the case however then all animals would do the same thing, there would not be as much variety as there is.
However, thanks to the awesome German Mercedes Benz engineers and makers of my car, all my body parts remained together and still functioned as a unit.

Order has pattern, structure, and stagnation. The pattern is the blue prints the thing will follow in development and decay. The structure holds its pattern and provides stability and strength to the thing. Stagnation is when it has been held within a part of the pattern, or a singular structure maintained pristinely against change. Like a pool of water deep in a cavern, that lack of change makes it stagnant and tepid, unusable “as is” for any significant purpose.

Anyway, so now that I’ve put all of my excuses out there, I’m sorry to say that I can’t promise I’ll be blogging more frequently in the near future, but I can promise that I will try. The reason I am writing this right now, actually, is because I just wanted to let everyone know about this really cool event that will be happening this weekend!
Water is always a hot topic on the site. Too much rain, two weeks last May, or too little, the remaining fifty weeks of the year, with heavy clay soil either results in flooded plots or beds as hard as a brick.
B) My decisions about book buying now are, sadly, usually very strategic. I don't tend to 'impulse buy' books anymore, but because I have so many to read I carefully consider which ones should be added to my collection. This HAS taken a bit of the fun out of book shopping.
I was delighted when I came across this awesome video of a family doing their own cover of Depeche Mode's "Everything Counts". I hope it inspires you to share the 80s with your kids during your family time; it will make EVERYONE happy. Just bang a drum or blow a whistle. Don't say that you can't do it: you CAN.
Since the dawn of the nuclear age, countless books, films and TV shows have explored the post-apocalyptic world left after the nuclear mushrooms have dissipated. There have been somber, intellectual works and outrageous parodies that covered this concept. With the former early notable films include Five, The World, The Flesh And The Devil, and On The Beach. These early works naturally got many details incorrect. For instance, with The World, The Flesh And The Devil, our hero (played by Harry Belafonte) is the sole survivor of World War III (at least for the first half of the film) and winds up in an abandoned New York City where all the buildings are intact and there aren’t any bodies anywhere. The film tried to explain it away with a silly line about radioactive isotopes that dissipated after five days. Despite its scientific inaccuracies, the film was an interesting look at how a person would cope after surviving the apocalypse. At least in the movie Five the dangers of radiation are shown, the same with On The Beach. The latter was more of a character study about how we would face our untimely end (the film and book took place in Australia where an American submarine crew took refuge from the fallout of World War III but radioactive winds will soon reach the continent, dooming everyone living there), while Five showed how we can try to carry on emotionally after a traumatic event. The TV series The Twilight Zone had several episodes dedicated to nuclear war, some of the better known ones included “Time Enough At Last ,” “Two,” “The Shelter,” and “The Old Man In The Cave.”
That the number of deaths of lung cancer for Mexican men aged 70-74 is only hundreds more than in Scotland is also astonishing. One might think that Mexicans have some genetic advantage but clearly this did not help the Spanish.
My faith position opened the door of exploitation. Their sly entrapment crept through the words not spoken and gestures of deceit as if I was moronically naïve.

I inherited 2 kaftans (persian robes) from my dad. A friend made them for him to wear when he had cancer so it would be easier to get around the house. Over the years I wore one out completely. The other I'm wearing right now.

AWESOME SPREAD. So far I have eaten this on toast and on english muffins. We are trying it on french toast soon. I am in love. It was a great way to use some of the fresh picked strawberries that I bought at the farmers market! I found this recipe/image here and doubled the batch to send some home with my mom!

We left Lake D'Arbonne around 11:00 this morning and rode around the park to see where everything was located. Found the Visitor's Center, swimming pool and tennis courts which were under construction and many workers were giving me the look, "You can't come in here."
I workout as much as I possibly can in order to justify eating large quantities of junk food.
10/8 - Louisville, KY – Headliners
One day down. A bunch more to go.
We found our tea shop and a loo, then ventured off toward Doolin. We drove around Limerick, but had no time to stop. The days are much shorter in the winter and we had our destination in mind. This required that we boogie on down the road. Again, we traversed the narrow fence and shrub-lined roadways. Jim managed the roads well, but as the afternoon began to wane and light disappeared, the tension mounted. By the time we hit Doolin, the light was gone from the sky as we made our way in the dark. No lighted poles lined the roads as at home, making the drive a bit more harrowing. A light mist floated on the air and covered the dark ground with a moist reflection. Doolin is a teeny, yet famous town. The home of traditional Irish music had but three pubs to its name. Our little car found its way to the middle one---McGann's Pub---and so, an unexpected adventure began. Ever found yourself unexpectedly in the middle of a stag (bachelor) party? Neither had we.

I would be willing to teach acting, in an environment in which the students can already act. “That’s awfully brave of you, Kevin,” you feel like posting as a comment (but you don’t.) Allow me to explain.
I knew of a guest house owner who always demanded to know the race of prospective clients. If challenged, she would say this was so that she could buy in the appropriate ethnic food to make them feel at home which seemed to show her in a good light. In reality, it was so that she could say 'no room at the inn.'

What is your favorite thing about us?
On the second floor are four large apartments and several smaller ones, each of which is a study in artistic decoration. On the third floor are many other rooms, one of which is formed by the octagonal tower before mentioned, and is intended for a little conservatory. The ceilings on the first floor are eleven feet high and on the second, ten.
This age is , I know, just a precursor to the teen years to come. As frustrating as certain moments can be, I treasure this time. Yes, he is half-grown, but if the glimpses that I see of the man he may become prove true, he will grow to be a man of worth. That is what I hope someday to see.
On Saturday me and J took a trip to a vintage / antique shop on our street that we have *never* visited before! Admittedly I don't think it's been open in it's current state before so we decided to take a look. I got this necklace for £5!
In other news, the winner of my 300 follower contest has now been chosen. The winner is Maya, and she's already been contacted and chosen her three books which will be winging their way to her this week. Thanks to everyone who entered, posted, tweeted etc. You all rock. :)
Riedel is correct in assessing the White House's order as hardball - but a wider list of targets exists outside of Saleh's circle. Meanwhile the financial threat against him and his family remains relatively soft. For starters, the Obama administration still cannot bring itself to speak Saleh's name, demonstrating that its kid gloves have yet to fall off. Contrary to a safety issue, the policy of gradually (and silently) nudging Saleh out of power is linked to hegemonic ambitions. U.S. and EU officials also have floated the possibility of sanctions on various occasions without acting, even though Saleh has persistently obstructed the GCC deal since its release in April 2011.

Having said that I did enjoy the story for the most part. It has an interesting premise. I would be tempted to read others in the series but more so watch the tv show. I somehow think they might have done it a tiny bit better (unusual, I know).
I find these to be several of the only quotes worth reading. It drives me crazy how people frantically scribble down what celebrities say at concerts, how reporters record the rantings and ravings of the president of a company with really nothing to say. We are all guilty of doing this, we all have our favorite quotes, and we all find some people to be insane. Most of the people that I quoted above are, in fact, very insane. The quote that makes the most sense to me is that, “In a mad world, only the mad are insane.” Since we are are all insane to some degree, everyone is sane, but if everyone that is insane is sane, what happens to the people who are really sane? Yes, they become the insane. Thinking about insanity will truly drive you to partial insanity. Thinking about anything too deeply will drive you to partial insanity. And that’s all that this blog really is. Thinking about anything and everything that I can think of too deeply.
Three of the Republicans picked Prescott Bush, rather than the only Republican alive who has navigated the Connecticut political waters to win a senate seat, and be re-elected to it two times. Linda McMahon picked Joe Lieberman, and Chris Shays picked William Johnson, one Connecticut’s first two senators.
"The Grand Rapids LipDub Video was filmed May 22nd, with 5,000 people, and involved a major shutdown of downtown Grand Rapids, which was filled with marching bands, parades, weddings, motorcades, bridges on fire, and helicopter take offs. It is the largest and longest LipDub video, to date.
"He's gone," the shopkeeper said. "Left a while back." David felt gratitude for her little lie.
The shorts are a purchase I made last spring from Beyond Retro and I really love the crochet detailing around the hem on the legs even if the shorts do reveal a slightly unflattering 'tummy pouch' when I stand side on. They saw me through the heat when I spent a few days in Italy with my Dad and his family and I can't wait to wear them again this summer with a big brimmed hat and espadrilles. When I think of Summer and Espadrilles I always think of the cover of Tracey Emin's book. Bronzed skin, simple gold jewellry and espadrilles, a classic summer look I will never stop replicating.
Ohhh Ohh Ohh
We lived and died through the John Elway years of watching the Broncos struggle to finally become Superbowl champions. Unfortunately, during those early years, our church service started at 2:00 on Sunday afternoon and we were forced to record the games on the VCR and then make sure that we didn’t talk to anyone or mistakenly turn on a radio lest our joy of watching the game might be spoiled.
Her mother shows up. Now I’m really getting yelled at. And it’s dusk outside. And I don’t have my glasses on. And her mom is still yelling at me to get the hell up and out. And to clean up my mess. Someone throws paper towels on me. I sit up. I clean up my mess as best I could. I look around at the couch, see my glasses, put them on and stumbled out.
After the crack it took a while for my heart rate to go back to normal. (Maybe I got some cardio exercise in as well?) In any case, I brought in a nice new stretch band today, and I hope it lasts a while (the other one was probably 8 months old?), since now I’m a little leery about stretching them too far!
“What was that?” Summer demands.
This blogging thing is not quite the same as when I would write in my diary/journal. I thought it would be. The differences are small but noticeable.

Well there we go from 3 months blogging to nearly a week off.
I feel that one of the hardest part of losing a child later in the pregnancy is that fact that I have gain at least an extra 20 pounds but no baby to show for it. Does that make sense?
I’m working in the Champs-Elysées office this week (yay!) and just turned around to look out the window… snow! More snow! It’s pretty, but… I am so ready for it to warm up. It’s been below freezing since Sunday and I just can’t get warm.
I had a dream the other night that everyone was named Suzy. Even me, although I think I got to be addressed by the more formal Susan. Then again, I seem to recall being called Suzy at some point, which, dream logic being what it is, suggested the general rule that everyone was called Suzy.
Oh, and I was taken aback by that young woman the other day. If you are asking if I would marry her, the answer is... possibly. Does her fondness stay when time passes? Does she know what having and raising children is from seeing it at home? Does she know what insufferable, stale, hard bores men can be at times from knowing a father? Is she strong enough to take her own positions when her conscience calls? Does she know the difference between conscience and want? Though I would be hard pressed to start such a relationship, if I saw the cues I would begin pursuing vigorously. While I would prefer to protect such a woman, from... such a man... if the fates worked a certain way, I would do more. But not in the original intent of such thinking. Men her age, even older, are more interested in doing what I used to do. If she is seriously considering marriage, I would be offering what she wants. Of course, I would be her father's age, so... extended family dinners, let alone the initial introductions, would be quite... interesting. Potentially fatal. But for her, I would hold her hand through her father's funeral.

Of course those purists, after years of rumors and false-starts, got their wish when Roth reunited with Van Halen for a monumentally successful tour in 2007. It wasn’t a true reunion of the original band, though. In the ultimate act of rock & roll nepotism, longtime bassist Michael Anthony was unceremoniously dumped and replaced by Eddie Van Halen’s pudgy son, Wolfgang.

I think it was about a week ago that Laurie, from Cookin' Up North, posted the recipe for her Curry Chicken Salad on her blog. I knew that I had most of the ingredients on hand, so I decided to try it. Be sure to visit her blog to get the original recipe. I tweaked this a bit, simply because I didn't have exactly the same ingredients - but close.

Now they’re next door in her bedroom. There’s laughing again and my wife is joking with her and my daughter says “You’re pulling my leg”, which is a useful phrase to know in our house. My wife tries to persuade her to go downstairs and brush her teeth. More giggling. She gives up and tickles her instead.
Sounds weird, right? Well, with today being pizza Friday in our house and I have a ton of leftover pork from last night's dinner I decided to experiment and make a pizza with the pulled pork.

So off to Target I went. Target is right beside Trader Joe's here, so after I got my blender, I walked over to Trader Joe's and loaded up on organic bananas, pears, kiwi, pineapple, spinach, clementines, kale, sugar snap peas, and broccoli, before I even knew I was doing it! It was like I was on auto-pilot. OK! Raw trial starts tomorrow! That's cool.

so. does shrinking it down and having the creativity to put it on a pendant constitute enough of a "change" (heh) to call it your own work of art? does running it through photoshop and giving it a weathered look make it your own?

1. Physicians Formula Happy Booster Bronzer: I had previously purchased the blush and really have been enjoying using it. It has great color and and the texture allows for easy blending on top of my powder; it also smells really good. But I was so dissapointed with this bronzer! There is virtually no color payoff, the colors look great in the pan but barely get on the brush (I was vigorously swooshing and stabbing it just so I could get some product). So after going through every possible brush I own, I gave up.

Possibly the greatest aspect of the show is that we are reminded that it is never to late to make changes in our lives. This last years show is proof of this. Several of the oldest participants on the show lost the most significant amounts of weight. To see a man in his 60′s who had been obese for years drop half his weight was incredible. Even the winner at 48 years of age beat out many of the young guns who were more athletic and who had more weight to lose. Being that I am in my mid 40′s I am reminded it is never to late to make changes in my life. Certainly there are more good things about this show but let me change gears now.

Even though black South Africans under the White National Apartheid government had (a) the highest per capita income and education levels for Africans in Africa; (b) had the highest life expectancy for black Africans in African; and (c) the lowest infant mortality of Africans in Africa; Nelson Mandela considered it important to wage an extremely violent and terrorist ‘liberation struggle’ against this alleged ‘oppressive government’ which provided black Africans with better living standards than any other black government in Africa.
We are all soccer all the time around here lately. Between Brent and the boys, we are dealing with soccer 5 nights of the week. Jack's first game was last weekend and I wasn't sure if I should laugh or cry from the sidelines. 5 year old soccer is pretty entertaining to watch, but also kind of pathetic. Jack did just fine, but some of the kids are picking their noses or sitting down or wandering off the field in search of snacks.
Fear of rejection is the single tallest impediment to a writer’s forward momentum and possible success. For years, I wrote volumes without submitting it to anyone, anywhere. Once I tentatively began submitting, I experienced rejection just like everyone else does and I survived. Yet, every time I am faced with an unopened email, I do battle with myself again. I tell myself, “Hey you survived the last rejection! You lived to write again.” Then, a very small voice squeaks out some truly terrifying words: “Maybe it’s not a rejection?” Dear God, who had the nerve to say that?

natural splendour of her voice might work against her. As she admitted to the Globe and Mail recently, she’s had music biz people tell her that she should use Auto-Tune because radio won’t play her if she sounds too, ahem, soulful.

That day, the other family's agency finally relented and agreed to let them pursue the boy's adoption. I wasn't sure what to make of this news. Later that evening, however, she e-mailed me and explained that they still had to convince their social worker, raise funds for two adoptions in five weeks and figure out how they were going to handle their kids at home for the trip. She asked if we wanted to adopt the boy.
Before we met up at Julie’s to help w/ the move, we arrived a bit earlier to check out Huntley Meadows Park which was nearby. It is home to 1,425 acres of forest, wetlands, and meadows – good for walking, birding or checking out turtles, beavers, snakes (like the one we saw; no pictures to post here though or my mom would likely faint), herons, etc. There’s a boardwalk trail which was easy for Abby. We saw some red-winged black birds, a bunch of beaver dams, turtles, ducks, a blacksnake, and some kind of skink or salamander. We also visited the nature/visitor center.

Hello Everyone!! Today's card is one that I was lucky enough to have published in Cardmaking, Stamping and Papercraft in December (Vol 17 No 12) as part of a trio of cards! Since it is now March, I figured it would be OK to finally put it on my blog! :)
By using little makeup on my face and eyes, I can have fun with lipstick without worry of it being too much. Right now, a variety of reds get me through every situation. Favorites are: Chantecaille Amaryllis (sheer), Chanel Gabriella (bright neutral red), Chanel Vendôme (perfect red, neither too bright or too dark), Chanel Talisman (browned Vendôme), and Chanel Attitude (rosey red). This summer I've also become positively smitten with the fabulously neutral rose shade of Chanel Romantic. I've had it for a long time, but now it's perfect. It seems to go with every color in my scarf collection, so if you're looking for a solid, neutral shade for summer without going red, but that wears perfectly with red or pink or anything else, I recommend that one.

When it comes to things such as lipstick, eyeliner or eyeshadows: I don't feel the need to buy high-end brands of that stuff, thankfully. But I will not settle for a drugstore's own brand, or something like that. I only buy from L'Oreal, Bourjois and sometimes Maybelline. Those are my three favorite drugstore brands.

They were gone and I was left waiting and staring at blood-work that no longer worried me. I silently thanked the Lord for my health and the health of my husband and children and His grace and mercy that is ever-new and flowing for us all. He meets us where we are. My appt went well and while more tests still need to be run, my problems are far from life threatening. I need to make the most of what I have right now and not waste a single day worrying about things I have no control over. My problems are so small, and I'm so thankful that I left eye opening "Narnia" with a refreshed perspective.

The 80hp boost KERS provides, stresses the engine. This was well known back in 2009, but for 2011 along with DRS the car can be several hundred revs higher than the usual EOS (end of straight) revs. Mercedes AMG quoted 15-25% more stress for a KERS and DRS aided lap, this needing to be taken into account when the team monitor the engines duty cycle, thus deciding when to replace it. Mercedes conducted additional dyno development of the engine being kept on the rev limiter to fully understand and counter this problem. This work paid benefits; Hamilton ran many laps at Monza bouncing off the rev limiter along the main straight, while chasing Vettel.
Firstly, while Ennahdha is a well-oiled and disciplined political machine, its leadership is widely recognized as lying at the more liberal end of the party’s political spectrum. The debate over sharia was, by Ennahdha leader Rached Ghannouchi’s own confession, widely contested within the party before being decided upon. Ghannouchi’s argument was not a defense of civil institutions, but rather a wish to avoid a controversial debate at a critical time for the country.
There's plenty of red meat here for Bourdain's fans, including slaps at the classic easy targets like Rachel Ray and Sandra Lee. Wielding his pen like a slasher movie villain wields a chef's knife is what we've come to expect from Bourdain, and he doesn't disappoint. I love the snark as much as the next sarcastic blogger, but I feel like it's become part of a schtick for Bourdain.

Yes, laughing is so important!! When I feel the need to let off some steam, I watch old sketches of my all time favorite show, Saturday Night Live. Whatever you favorite comedy is, I am sure you can find it on YouTube. Take a moment to reflect on how good it feels to laugh, in that moment you are tuning in to who you really are. Savor this time and commit to doing this more often! Laughter really is the best medicine!
I thank you for the assurance of the resurrection, provided to us by the resurrection of Jesus. I believe in this, Father, no matter what skeptics may say. You have given me faith to believe, and I cherish and embrace that faith. The resurrection of Christ has given me justification, sanctification, and assurance of what is to come.

As this point, you can make a list of foods with low glycemic index and prepare for a trip to the store. Now, you'll be gung ho at a point when you could otherwise be most vulnerable. Your enthusiasm over prospective change can help thwart the tendency to grab items off your old shopping list. If you are faithful to the list, you will be faithful to eating foods with low glycemic index, since that's all that should be in your house.

For my card today- I decided to play along with the polka dots. I love polka dots, and these are a great size. The sentiment prompted me to use a Spellbinders heart die, although, I think this could be an anytime of year card. It's finished off with some teal May Arts ribbon and teal Want2Scrap baby bling.
Separation or divorce usually means learning to live with less-- a smaller home, less "stuff," a less expensive car, etc. Before resisting moving, just try looking around. Consider how it might feel to get a true fresh start in a fresh place, no bad memories lurking in the walls or under the floorboards waiting to grab your ankles and trip you up. Consider how there will be less to clean, and that you won't have to take anyone else's tastes into consideration.
We are being given a false dilemma - either show outrage against the lacrosse team and its party and support those who made noise about it, or deny that racism and sexism and assault exist.

Holloway also tweeted a link to the blog run by Mark Anthony ("Thugniggaintellectual") Neal, who ran a post by David Leonard criticizing the paper. Imitating Holloway's race-baiting tactics, Leonard asserted that the paper (whose data he, too, did not challenge) "has dangerous implications."
There is so much stigma surrounding suicide and sometimes the stigma is worse than the suicide. I know that’s a pretty strong statement, but for many – it is the case. People are uncomfortable even with the word “suicide”, you can see them almost cringe when you say it. I noticed this immediately when I lost my husband Rob and would tell someone when asked how he’d passed. I quickly learned to soften the words and just tell them “unfortunately he took his own life” and even that left many reeling.

We talked for a while and then my brother came in and was being a pain. He hadn’t slept the night before and didn’t want to eat or go to bed now. Mr. T was surprisingly non-judgmental and tried to help, especially when one of my brother’s friends called for him to come pick him up from a party. Anyway, that all worked out, but it was getting on 3am before I actually made up the couch for Mr. T to sleep on. I decided to sleep on the little couch next to him, ostensibly so I would know when my brother got home and make sure he went to bed, but really because I wanted to be close to Mr. T.

This consists entirely of the depressed disposition of a confused and vain soul. The inustice fueling incosiderable intolerable judgements, the world is the last part of a series of undesireable entities travelling through the emptiness that is all around and casting down the glaring rays of animalistic rage and ignorance, pure unbridled and ready to tear down the buildings of confidence related structure. We cannot avoid our own decisions just as we cannot ignore the inevitable reality that we may acomplish absolutely nothing worth being appreciated in this life and being that it may be the only single thing more important to ourselves than the possibility of god, we doom ourselves to our respective prisons.

And speaking of movies, did I tell you that we saw Hugo 3D? It was so much fun! I went to it as a reluctant participant, only going along because our friends had suggested it and I thought, "What the heck?" The 3D was exquisite and the detail pulled me in until I forgot that I existed. I highly recommend it, even though it's very expensive (I think) for a movie. $14 per adult! That's more than many people make in an hour! That's more than the net pay after two hours of work for a huge number of people!

The Islamist parties compete at the “grass roots” with the leftists. They build up a clientele of supporters among the poor in the countryside and urban slums through organized charity and basic social services administered at the mosques and humanitarian religious foundations. Because they reject class struggle and are intensely hostile to the left (with its secular, pro-feminist and working-class agenda), they have been ‘half-tolerated’ by the dictatorship, while the leftist activists are routinely murdered. Subsequently, with the overthrow of the dictatorship, the Islamists emerge intact with the strongest national organizational network as the country’s ‘natural leaders’ from the religious-bazaar merchant political elite. Their leaders offer to serve the empire and its traditional native military collaborators in exchange for a ‘slice of power’, especially over morality, culture, religion and households (women), in other words, the “micro-society”.’

We know many of you cannot comprehend that anyone could fall to that extent, but with the almost total loss of Light such souls have lost any feelings of compassion.
Yet really, it does everything necessary: it's got the intriguing title, the author name, and a mildly interesting picture - even if the cartwheel with nesting storks appears to be hovering in mid-air. Compared with my modern cover, above, it could even be regarded as pleasingly uncluttered. At any rate, with such a book one wasted no time in opening it to see what it was about, and so the decision whether to read it or not was prose-based...

Which leaves homeschooling. This would be a bad idea for us on so many levels. It would not be easy for me to do with a 2 year old at home. Bryn and I don't work terribly well together as she is argumentative and I am overly critical. She would REALLY miss her friends and the social side of school. I know she would have plenty of activities and social outlets, but being home with me all day is not he same as being at recess with 10 other little girlfriends.
It was quite intimidating waiting for the race to start. I saw a wide variety of different runners and got nervous! There were marathon maniacs, first-timers (like myself), people dressed up in costumes, just about everything!

I knew Cathy would need a little more coverage than usual for a long night, so I opted for this Maybelline "Instant Age Rewind" concealer/highlighter stick. I can't vouch for its effectiveness relative to other products, but it kept Cathy glowing well past the bewitching hour.
Cindy Haffner is next on our technique challenge showcase. Cindy is using the Summer Blossoms set. For the technique challenge, Cindy stamped the leafy image in olive. Love the subtle variation of color with a more detailed fine image. For added visual effect and to give some definition, Cindy misted additional colors. Cindy combined embossing texture, piercing, and corner accent with ribbon detailing to finish her card. Gorgeous, Cindy!

Well, even though it will be well after the fact, I might have a chance to meet the Walkers some time next Spring, so that will be a very nice thing. They are supposed to attend a wedding somewhere nearby and while I don't know that I can get the whole family coordinated maybe I can still swing some kind of meet.

One of Teddy’s biggest challenges are posts that are in the wrong place for the remodeling but support the house above through a load bearing wall. While some newer homes have floor trusses, most have a center beam supported by posts every 8 feet. Sometimes Teddy finds those darn posts are right in the middle of the room and the beam may even need to be changed! Teddy scratches his furry head. What to do? Luckily the experienced contractors at TLC Construction have dealt with these problems. They know moving a post or posts is not a simple matter because increasing the distance between posts changes the load factor. The current beam must be able to carry the load or a new beam will be required. The basement floor must be opened up to pour proper footings to support the new posts. Inspectors from the local municipality must inspect these items and approve the changes. Wow thought Teddy, lots to consider!

And finally a pretty girl holding a tray of strawberries. In the small island of Taiwan if the food is not in season then it's hard to get. You can not have strawberries year round like you can in America. Its not a tragedy though. When you do get them you LOVE them and put them on a tray and serve them in their whole form with champagne. Very special and classy. These strawberries were from Japan, which made them seem even more special.

It can’t be repeated or emphasized enough. The biggest lie of the “war on terrorism”, although weakening, is that the targets of America’s attacks have an irrational hatred of the United States and its way of life, based on religious and cultural misunderstandings and envy. The large body of evidence to the contrary includes a 2004 report from the Defense Science Board, “a Federal advisory committee established to provide independent advice to the Secretary of Defense.” The report states:

It is a good point because though the original Holmes clearly loved to show-off and add a touch of drama to his investigations, he liked to stay out of the press and happily let the police take the credit for most of his cases. But here we see Holmes at the start of the episode being publically acknowledged and rewarded by the police for his involvement in the solving of various crimes – including the art theft which gave rise to his nickname of the Reichenbach Hero. Did Sherlock know that if he became too famous and admired, Moriarty would try to bring him down? Did he use this as a tactic to draw him out and engage him in battle? Cannelle commented – ‘And I also think that Sherlock was playing along with Moriarty all this time, fooling everyone into thinking that he was struggling to keep up. He wouldn’t have had time to set up his fake death, had he only then discovered what the final problem was.’ Excellent point.
At about the same time, a record "Got My Mojo Working", sung by Muddy Waters, was issued by Chess Records. This also was referred to as a "sleeper of the week" in the same April 20, 1957 edition of Cashbox.

As I seriously doubt that this franchise was supposed to run for as long as it did the filmmakers were placed in an interesting trap of their own, they were forced to create a mythology as they went. The characters whom the traps were inflicted on were never the real story, they were a means to an end to tell Jigsaw's story. Now, when you're character dies mid-way through the series, all the filmmakers can do is tell his story, through FLASHBACK! Now I tend to think of flashbacks (like voice overs) as a pretty lazy way to tell stories unless they are integral to the story (i.e. The Usual Suspects). Saw could have moved on to other story arcs but I guess the promise of the Jigsaw returning in new ways was too enticing. We're also now running into the problem of making the villain the hero of the franchise. Which again, is not the worst thing to ever happen to filmmaking, the producers etc just painted themselves into a corner.

Friday, I went with Denise to a Canadian restaurant where she was invited by some of her students (she's Canadian). It was called Indian Trapper, and it was neither politically correct or Canadian save for a few things like the Quebecois poutine (though nothing close to the real thing) and for some things with maple syrup. However, it was a fun night and it involved free cake.

We desperately want someone to come and buy the shop. We want the heart of our village back. We also want our former shopkeeper to be able to live his life, happily, away from sad memories. We can't afford what he wants for it, and we really hope someone will come along and take it over. We will support them: this village is nothing if not supportive and willing.
Young children are eager to learn and as parents and educators we should jump on this eagerness with glee and use the tools at our disposal to ensure they can develop important creative skills such as imagination and curiosity. Illustrated picture books are the first step in learning to read and opening up a whole new world of understanding and the endless scope of imagination. As the phrase goes, "a picture is worth a thousand words" and it’s worth many billions more when you consider the value illustrations can have in a child’s education, development and creativity. An active imagination is a fantastic faculty to possess and the power of art and illustration is key to building it in our children.

Then, there are the other blogs that I follow. They seem to fall into two categories, one is people who take much better photos of flowers than I could ever hope to take, mostly because they have the proper equipment for it. The other category is bloggers who are very well-educated as to the identities of the various wildflowers and they are far better educated than I am, so what I would post would be lacking.

My time was winding down at ND, and in the spring before would eventually graduate (I left in the fall and graduated the follow May), the opportunity presented itself.

My problem with all this is that I can not stop eating! I am eating everything in sight. I have bumped up my workouts to 1 1/2 hours a day now instead of my regular 30-40 mins and I am still gaining weight. This week I am going to work more on my eating habits. I have been running, doing the wii active and Jillian Michaels' 30 day shred. My body is aching in places I had no idea you could even work out but I am determined to get out of this without gaining 30lbs (I have already gained 8lbs)
Here is what is most obvious, aka, the prime suspect: The weather around here is generally lovely, so that whenever our graduated Cerulean Blue skies are deflowered, I've come to anticipate foul weather within 24 hours, more or less. Some things really are learned through the simple observations of simple people, for example, people who have spent a lifetime sailing the open waters where sensitivity to the elements takes precedence over the charted course, in this case the habitual siege on the heavens rather accurately portends high winds, heavy rains, overcast skies, often hail and snow and not always at the time of year you would expect.

I do not pretend to know how to reconcile the incongruity of our temporal lives, with the passionate inner drive we once felt towards one another. There are no words that can explain the inexplicable, and we should not belabor the point beyond recognition of it. As I tried to express to you so many times, as I tended to our mutual desires, there was no way to avoid longing for you to open to me in your gentle, caring way. The way you so lovingly and generously gave to me of yourself, especially while we were apart, was immensely effective in bringing the love from within you directly to my heart.

As a young and still-idealistic person, I avoided Women-in-Prison movies, deeming them to be mean-spirited sexist junk. It turns out young and still-idealistic me was 100% right. Some have pointed to "empowering representations of females fighting the system," but all I see are women are locked up while wearing tiny clothing and being assaulted. Ain't nothin' empowering about that no matter how metatextual you want to get! But that's not to say I didn't wind up getting a kick out of these movies. Talking about the Women-in-Prison genre in the context of political correctness misses the point entirely, because it comes from a creative place motivated by the dark bits of the Id. It's this unrepentant luridness--there are no fantastical trappings or elegant production choices to soften the subject matter--that provides the joy of the Women-in-Prison genre. The Judgement Hat should be checked at the door and the Stained Raincoat should be donned before sitting down to watch one of these movies.
And I cut way back on the petting and the treat-giving. A breeder who lives in harmony with a houseful of German Shepherds says, "I never give my dogs too much food, or too much love."

When I was just getting into blogging, I had read that bloggers are a community, and that bloggers read blogs and make comments, and its because of this community that the blogging world has earned its authority.

I'd been looking forward to seeing The G7 as a live entity since hearing their guitarist and main vocalist Allan Crockford's demos before he'd even got the bodies together to perform the songs in a live environment. Allan has a wealth of experience on the live circuit (he's an ex-Prisoners / Solarflares / Stabilisers / Headcoats / James Taylor Quartet member plus other bands too numerous to mention) and together with noted session bassist Paul Moss, keyboard player Viv Bonsels and drummer Russ Baxter, have recently come back to Merry Ol' England from a well received tour of Benelux countries. It must have been disappointing for them to play in what was largely a vacuous venue that is capable of holding around 150 punters on their return.
And with that, I will wish you all a very Happy New Year, filled with joy and health and, of course, lots of learning!

: : and we found dresses for my daughter's wedding! she found her's, and this one is mine. and that is just about the most exciting thing. it happened for my girl the way i'd hoped. she fell in love with hers. she cried, i cried. wedding planning is so much fun. except for the not so fun part of missing my youngest girl who lives across the country, and wanting her to be involved too. i'm missing my sons, but they don't care too very much (not at all) about wedding planning. so we are doing our best to stay connected with, emails, links, photos and phone calls. i'm sure that some sort of hand knit cover up is next in the plans.

I am having trouble imagining going back to work. I don't want to use up all of my savings, and even if I did I would still have to work again eventually. But at least now when he has had a bad night (which has been every night) during the day while he is at school I can rest, and breathe, and read a book to escape my life.

You have made your glory higher than the heavens.
I work nights so it’s usually easiest for me to travel from early evening to early morning — the hours I usually keep anyway. The first caveat I’ll offer for those of you who do your preps shopping at night is that at most big-box stores, items are still being restocked throughout the night and into the morning, so IF something you need isn’t on the shelf, it might be coming up. Or you might just be out of luck.
If I didn’t already love Le Tassili for the reasons I listed above, I would love it for getting me to eat lamb, post-lamb stew disaster (long story short, I once ordered lamb stew meat from Peapod and when I opened the package it came in I almost fainted from the overwhelming loamy smell…and I cooked it anyway, and after hours of stirring horrible loamy-smelling lamb stew, I was off lamb forever). Grandpa and I agreed that this lamb didn’t really taste like LAMB; it was falling off the bone, but not mushy (“mouthfeel” being very important!).

I bought one can of spraypaint at Home Depot - Rust Oleum's "Orange", and spraypainted them (on left), but it was unfortunately to dark and reddish. It bothered me for a few days until I finally went and bought a different color orange - Krylon's "Pumpkin Orange". Much better.

When I got the offer to do a review for them I squealed with joy! Olive Garden has been one of my favorite restaurants for years. When Mr. TRH and I were newlyweds we didn't have much money to eat out. It was "THE" restaurant to go to for special occasions. After we have been married for so many years with three kids, Olive Garden is still our favorite restaurant.

When you consider all Mila has been through in the last 3 months, she is doing great. I mean the poor girl was taken out of the only home she's ever known, traveled half way across the world, saw lots of doctors, had airway surgery only 3 weeks after being home, and open heart surgery one week later! Whew! How did we make it through all that???? What a whirlwind! God surely carried us through and continues to do so. If someone would have told me this would be our path and we'd adopt a baby who would have so many medical needs, I would have said NOPE! We trusted God and followed him on the crooked, twisty-turvy path he laid ahead of us piece by piece. I never thought we'd be strong enough to make it down that path, but here we stand....rising with God by our side.

10:06 I am amazed at the analysis on Fox. They are trying to spin Michelle Obama’s speech as a wasted opportunity. Chris Wallace is proving to be just another partisan ass. He’s questioning the decision to have Michelle Obama leave her “stump speech” to give a background on their family, suggesting that people are more interested in the future. Chris, you dumb ass: these are people that are BLACK in case you haven’t noticed, who need to convince the WHITE people of this country that they’re like them and ok to vote for. I’m sure that his father would like to disown him, or at least disown his intellectual grasp. NOTE: All of you people who are watching/listening to Fox as a “news” source, just get over your bad selves.

The Obama administration’s hostility to Israel and the rush to preempt the Israeli Prime Minister’s speech is a reflection the 180 degree reversal of all previous administration’s relations with Israel. The president’s national security advisor, John Brennan, has referred to Jerusalem as “Al Quds”, the Arabic name for the ancient and modern capital of Israel and the State Department continues to send funds to Hamas.

For four days, I got to focus on the marathon, a goal reached in countless 5 am runs, post-call runs, and post-rounding runs, always carrying my pager, with only six days off since the beginning of the year. A goal reached with fundraising letters and blogging and meetings and parties and countless amounts of tears and inspiration from Dana-Farber. Four days of focus felt amazing. Everything else was peripheral.

A cable titled ” Potrait of a Lady” (wikileaks) Referring to her “eccentric paranoia,” the cable said, “According to Lucknow journalists, she employs nine cooks (two to cook, the others to watch over them) and two food tasters. She fears assassination and demanded from the central government the highest level of protection available. In addition to this outsized security apparatus, she constructed a private road from her residence to her office, which is cleaned immediately after her multiple vehicle convoy reaches its destination.”
It tends to stick with the kids, so that when they are fumbling while trying to talk about something, prompting them for “that sentence we use to name forces” (even though it’s not a sentence) or for “the something something force…” gets them to quickly clarify what they’re trying to say.

this is actually just a portion of a longer piece by John Donne ”Devotions upon Emergent Occasions“ which is a series of reflections that were written as Donne recovered from a serious illness. the work consists of twenty-three parts (‘devotions’) describing each stage of the sickness. each part is further divided into a Meditation, an Expostulation, and a Prayer. this piece is Meditation XVII, perhaps the best-known part of the work and forms part of Devotion XVII.
And all of that is before we even got our food. Admittedly, we ordered a bit too much. We started with the ratatouille, which I remembered as being truly awesome from the first time. It was still awesome, but I think there was something charmed about wandering in from the bitter cold to have hot warmly-spiced Moroccan food.

Tempers flare over the audacity of “US PEOPLE” coming in all of a sudden, out of the political woodworks hell bent on putting an end to all their warmongering, government growing, right stripping fun. Why can’t we just shut up and take a big slice of the status quo pie? Why can’t we be “realistic “and accept that the republican party would be thrusting itself on its own sword if they allowed Ron Paul to be the nominee? Look we’ve paid our dues, we’ve nestled our noses in places most unseemly in order to get where we are and by osh kosh ba gosh this is our last chance to become delegates and it’s not fair. It’s just not fair.
Given this principle, tax free income can be highly appealing for executives. S.O.L.A.R. insurance arrangements may provide important tax advantages to both businesses and key employees, including immediate tax deduction to the employer in many cases if the compensation is considered reasonable. However, the premium payment made by the employer will be taxable income to the employee. These arrangements may provide tax deferred growth, tax free income and death benefits.

Fifty percent of the profits are donated to the Fire Fighters Charity. Kresse shared some great stories of how as a child she was obsessed with recycling and visiting town dump and recycling centers. Her company is also exploring other potential recycling opportunities. She is referred to as environmental entrepreneur. Even the movie stars are joining her cause.

"Before diving into the sale, I entertained another serious buy-out offer, entertained an offer for investment from a premier investor," Know Your Meme founder Andrew Baron wrote on his blog, "and even considered turning it into a 'double bottom line' company, but all in all, everyone advised and I agreed that this was by far the best deal to be done (esp. because I was 100% owner of the company with no other investors or partners involved)."

This is unlike many other companies I know of who give the front line staff no empowerment and need everything run by the next level or two up. Even for small things. This does my head in – such a waste of time and effort on everyone’s part and 9 times out of 10, you get annoyed customers all the same. Do we really need to check with HQ or the bosses boss if someone wants to bring a small item back for a few pounds or dollars and doesn’t have the receipt, it’s unopened and clearly from that shop? No. Think of the cost of checking and delays. And the experience the customer is having. Not good and as the customer you think twice about using them again.

According to the ancient Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, December21, 2012, is the last day of a 5,125 year long cycle. It is believed that either a cataclysmic event (end of times) or a transformative event (physical or spiritual change) will occur at the end of this cycle. Although most scholars dismiss this predication as credible, it is still a popular belief that many hold as truth.

Portland, Ore., is the land of microbreweries, indie bands, bicyclists and rose gardens. Pittsburgh is often reviled by outsiders for its abrasive-sounding accent and rabid football fans. Portland has Portlandia, the hit comedy sketch show, while Pittsburgh just subs in as other cities in movies. Why did Listmakers Hesse and Zak bestow their blessings upon the latter? “Portland has overextended its welcome as the destination for hipsters who want to find themselves, while frolicking in beautiful scenery and reasonable rents,” says Hesse. “Pittsburgh is reasonable-rents, nice scenery, nice downtown, and the people are, in general, just far less insufferable.”

But there is one particular novel that I think of as the writing equivalent of settling down to a favourite film with a box of chocolates. It is a fantasy novel (for adults- not children), the kind that could run on to a series (I am currently a third of the way through the second book) but it will probably never be more than a guilty pleasure. Despite that, I love the characters and go back to that world to find out where they are and what they are doing - locked away in that virtual cupboard in my computer.
Ian Fleming is well known as being the creator of James Bond, but fewer people know that he was the creator of the original children’s story ‘Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’ . Even fewer would have known that the story was inspired by a real car.

The first thing i noticed as i raised my hands to look for my lock in the array of locks hanging along the chain was his enchanted face,gazing intently at me with a guarded enigmatic expression which spoke all languages restrained love was a polyglot of.The way he was looking at me made me realize how clumsy i was with the manoeuvre and how his eyes could find beauty in places wholly mundane and meaningless to the rest of us.Finally when i found my lock,i could not help but look wistfully at the chain which held so many of the locks along its entire length and was more than a merger of ordinary and the symbolic,of tangible and the spiritual.We were at the doorway of the Dargah,and i could already feel the waves of absolute peace and piety which cut you off from rest of the world leading to a trance almost painful and majorly exotic.

The taping of the stories lasted a little over two hours. Afterwards, they had everyone who told a story map out the area where their sighting was. The rest of us had to go outside and wait until that was done. Afterwards, they picked three stories they wanted to check out. One of our friends got picked. We were able to meet and greet with the cast after all was done. I have to say the each was very nice and accommodating. Sharon and I took pictures with all three.

His argument is how is art going to transform is there is no historical development?

Opening with Christianity, the first BBC page reverts to Marxist type as it explains that discrimination can only occur when prejudice is combined with power. As no minority race or religion in Britain is deemed to have power, so they can never discriminate against an indigenous British Christian.

Hmmm, I thought. Really? I knew the book deal was real--it had been announced in December--but given my previous contacts with Gross, the rest sounded kind of fishy, especially when a websearch on the Delmont-Ross Writing Contest turned up nothing but the announcement mentioning Gross.

Nevertheless, various press releases confirmed the award (here's an example, which survives only as HTML, but if you scroll down you can see the text), so I didn't follow up.

Her Sri Lankan fans, perhaps teenagers in the 70’s will best remember her in her role as Sandy to John Travolta’s Danny in the hit musical ‘Grease’. Over the course of the film she transforms from the sweet, wholesome girl next door (Sandy 1, as Olivia likes to call her character) to the confident siren (Sandy 2). More recently, a whole new generation of fans discovered her when she stepped out onto the sets of hit TV series Glee and got ‘Physical’ with Jane Lynch.

So, when Mattias heard a barbaric yell that burst from below the deck, quickly followed by what looked to be a mad man on a rampage, he suddenly had hope.

They seem to get bored of that and go “Anyway, here’s what I REALLY wanted to show you!” The last half an hour of this film is a blast, all restraint goes out of the window and the premise they spent at length setting up is delivered in as over the top way as possible. And that is why I recommend going to see this film. The third act is highly rewarding and well worth the price of admission. I don’t want to spoil it and to be honest I guessed (it isn’t difficult) what was coming about a 3rd of the way in but when it comes you really get a buzz out of it. However… I do have my gripes.

Even more inexplicable, however, was how little the media did to break the deafening silence. Not a single interviewer pressed Cantor or Boehner about the discrepancy at the time – and since then, to compound the error, the press has continued to shirk its duty. Days after calling for a bill estimated to reduce government revenue by $46 billion, Boehner is now adamant about offsetting one worth $6 billion. Has the phrase “penny wise, pound foolish” ever been more apt? The closest the fourth estate came to questioning the Republican rationale for the small-business tax break was this, from the AP:
The first response is that of the man. His response to Jesus’ grace was obedience. Jesus told the man he was forgiven, Jesus healed the entire man, and the man’s first response to Jesus was to obey. He took his mat, left the room, and went home praising God. Look, it may be nothing, but the word that Luke uses to describe this man ‘standing up’ is a derivative word that means ‘resurrection.’ I won’t take this too far because I don’t want to make this a mere analogy, but isn’t that quite a picture? Jesus raised this man to new life! Jesus gave this man a new day! Jesus brought this man back from the dead!

After its first year, the Inner Circle community featured many social channels for customers to interact with, including a blog, user forums, an idea exchange center, and poll and survey questions scattered about the site. Like many enterprises, Intuit was a bit wary at first of having an unfettered conversation and kept a tight rein on community members and managers. Initially posts had to be approved by PR and a number of managers before going live. Once the Intuit team became more comfortable with the community, however, the approval process disappeared.
I do love the challenges at CD Sunday Challenges, they are so different and I do have to put my thinking cap on and research, or in other words, trawl, through my CDs, which can be fun too. The theme this week is Reflections, so many ways this could be undertaken. I couldn't resist this image with the very pretty reflection in the mirror, which is on the CD - Fashion, a Maria G Design. The background paper is from Debbie Moore Shabby Chic Paper Delights. I added a large charm, pink flower with a simple flow of ribbon, and 3 pink gems.

Table napkins are essential when setting a table. No matter what occasion or gatherings you have at home, this definitely plays an important role. At present, there are a lot of innovations when it comes to their styles and designs. They are also folded differently to match the event you are celebrating. These things are very practical because they serve a lot of purposes. Aside from the fact that they are used to wipe food from your mouth, they also serve as a decoration, to make the table look elegant. To learn more about it, here are some details that you should look into:

Hey, everybody! My name is Lan Pitts and I'll be your host for this week. I'm a freelance writer from Atlanta (not to be confused with Hot-Lanta, that's something only tourists say) and columnist/critic for the Eisner-winning Newsarama, as well as contributed to various entertainment sites such as Fangoria and Shotgun Reviews. While Jimmy is recovering from his MegaCon hi-jinks, I thought I'd help out with your weekly dose of SEXY MONDAY. Now, Jimmy boy is very proud of this column and it's a very fine way to start the work week off.

Piccadilly now links directly to the theatres on Shaftesbury Avenue, as well as the Haymarket, Coventry Street (onwards to Leicester Square), and Glasshouse Street. The Circus is close to major shopping and entertainment areas in the West End. Its status as a major traffic intersection has made Piccadilly Circus a busy meeting place and a tourist attraction in its own right. The Circus is particularly known for its video display and neon signs mounted on the corner building on the northern side, as well as the Shaftesbury memorial fountain and statue of an archer popularly known as Eros (sometimes called The Angel of Christian Charity, but intended to be Anteros). It is surrounded by several noted buildings, including the London Pavilion and Criterion Theatre. Directly underneath the plaza is Piccadilly Circus tube station, part of the London Underground system.

We've always counseled in the Church for our Mexican members to marry Mexicans, our Japanese members to marry Japanese, our Caucasians to marry Caucasians, our Polynesian members to marry Polynesians. The counsel has been wise. You may say again, "Well, I know of exceptions." I do, too, and they've been very successful marriages. I know some of them. You might even say, "I can show you local Church leaders or perhaps even general leaders who have married out of their race." I say, "Yes--exceptions." Then I would remind you of that Relief Society woman's near-scriptural statement, "We'd like to follow the rule first, and then we'll take care of the exceptions."

CL. I do think that there is a lack of gender discourse in sound arts. I’m not entirely sure why this is but I suspect that it is largely because sound arts could still be said to be an emergent discipline so up until very recently it has been largely concerned with trying to trace its lineage and mark out its territory or set its boundaries very broadly. More recently the discourse has extended into the details of areas of practice but I think there is probably about to be a large expansion in the way that sound arts are practiced, viewed and talked about.

DD4L and I have been texting for the most part of his morning about him being an apparent angel so when he told me I can’t be because I’m a girl and there were only male angels in the Bible I was flabbergasted to discover that this is a true fact. How misleading has everything been since then with all those women pretending to be angels. Now, as he says, I’m just a human. I definitely need to go and get that kids edition of the Bible to find out what else it says.

For several years I have been looking for a natural looking red for my dolls. What a wonderful surprise when I received a skein of the softest mohair before Christmas, which I immidiately had to try out for my Little Mi Sets. As a dollmaker, I find it difficult to source good quality material, especially doll mohair. I seldom add extra strands to my doll wigs, therefore it is of importance for me that the mohair fibers are long enough. Most of the usual mohair yarns (from the yarn store) either don´t work for the special crochet technique I use for my wigs or the yarn comes in unnatural colours.

I remember the agonizing 2+ hour drive to Duluth. I made it alone. This was not something I wanted Jake to witness yet, as I didn’t know exactly what I was getting myself into. When I arrived at the hospital, my dad’s entire family was there… aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents all of which I hadn’t seen in years. It was overwhelming. I lost it. The first time I saw him my entire world crashed. I didn’t get a chance to even try and help him or fix things. I just moved on and lived my life.

The psychic I previously mentioned in yesterday’s post also spoke of my in-laws, knowing that Rob would do this, that it was some sort of sacred contract (Caroline Myss – Sacred Contracts speaks about this). The psychic said it was pre-decided when Rob chose to be born to my in-laws, that all of this had been laid out. Sounded pretty far fetched to me and I’ve listened to Caroline Myss’ Sacred Contracts. I told the psychic if his parents knew, they sure weren’t taking it well at all!

Pimento is very saturated. Like intensely so. I am shocked by how much color is in this glass. It overtakes everything! It's your basic opaque - not too stiff, doesn't bleed, or spread, and is consistent in shade, for the most part. It pretty much acts like an opaque red in the flame - it turns black when hot and can burn easily.

After her relationship with JFK was over, Judith and Giancana drifted into a sexual relationship that ended when she turned down his marriage proposal. By 1963, the relationship was over. Still the FBI continued to hound her because of her associations with Giancana and Johnny Roselli. Judith began dating Eddie Fisher and a pitcher for the Angels. She suffered health problems from the injections she had received from Dr. Max Jacobson, also known as ‘Dr. Feelgood.’ Jacobson was notorious in the 60’s for giving celebrities shots filled with not just vitamins but also amphetamines. In 1965, Judith gave birth prematurely to a son who she later gave up for adoption. She never revealed the name of the father.

Stay at least 2 nights and there will be sufficient time here for kayaking and shopping. Kayaking can be done on a half day basis, one full day or multiple days. Another option is to combine a half day kayaking and half day free and easy hiking. I opted for the latter and had a wonderful time.

You know that the BBC website surpasses other news outlets such as the New York Times (although the most viable option if you like your news to be from this country) and the Washington Post. You know that the BBC has the most functional lay out because it is set up like a website and not like a newspaper that is online. You also know that in regards to the three elements that make a good news outlet; multimedia, interactivity, and on-demand, the BBC incorporates all three and does so very well.

My first reaction to the news at the time was astonishment. I wondered just how actively hateful and cruel one had to be to stand out as a villain amongst Nazi concentration camp guards. My second reaction at the time was one of disgust when I heard media pundits debating whether or not it was “worth it at this point” to pursue a WWII war criminal. I wanted to ask the pundits precisely how many days after the murder of an innocent child does the murder become irrelevant? When does the dead child, or in this case the many thousands of victims of Ivan the Terrible’s brutality, cease to matter? What is the shelf life of justice? What is the sell-by date of morality?

The relationship between M and Bond is different than it’s ever been this time around. With Brosnan’s Bond, Dench’s M was also a bad-ass, but there was always the sense that, relative to their fields, they were both at the top of their profession. Dench’s M actually has to prove herself to Bond in GOLDENEYE but this becomes mutual respect as the series progresses. In CASINO, M is clearly the superior, and her admonishing of Bond is much more … I hesitate to use the word “maternal” because I think I want to use it just because M’s a woman and Bond’s a man, but her attitude towards Bond is one-part taskmaster, one-part shepherd. “They want your head,” she tells him sternly. “I’m considering giving it to them.”

Once we recognize that Davis at some early stage was evidently sympathetic to Rolly's offbeat interior design, we may be able to go back and visualize, at least a little bit, what the Stretching Gallery masterpiece might have looked like. Yale built a half-inch scale model of the elongating room and suggested to Rolly that he design the stretching portraits. Rolly did produce some sketches, but later on Marc wasn't satisfied with them and replaced them with his own. Despite that loss, I think that Davis's beautiful concept artwork may give us a hint of what might have been. It's certainly weirder than what we ended up with. In fact, if you ask me, the one item in the sketch that looks slightly out of place is the Davis portrait! Is that because the essentials of this design came from elsewhere?

Mankind has been operating with a very low third dimensional energy for thousands of years. This is why so many have trouble leaving that which is so familiar to them behind. No longer can you hold onto old and outdated events. No longer can you use these to play the role of victim. Again I quote Kuthumi who says, “There are no victims, there is only experience.”
In my situation, the stereotyping was overwhelming. This has much to do with my secular attitude as well as my belonging to Atbara, the city which is considered to be the stronghold of the ideology. Ironically, I have never been a communist, despite the fact that my father is one, and that’s why he named me after the godfather of the party. However, through all of my life, not one of those who came across and threw their jokes and sarcasms around stopped for a second to ask if I am a communist or not. I was left with no choice than to accept it as a de facto truth and live with it. Fortunately, I haven’t been bothered by such labelling as I never have had any tendencies towards any religious beliefs.
The question is why does sin separate us from God? The answer to that is God is holy. In Isaiah 6:3, the prophet tells us that the angels worship Him by calling out ‘Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts…’ The significance of the repetition is important to note here also. For the only time in the bible, something is ‘holy holy holy’; in the Hebrew language, the author is trying to convey that the human mind cannot comprehend how holy God is. It is an unreachable holiness.

How they would have to sleep three and four in a bed to keep warm at night because the pot belly stove would be banked and put to bed for the night? Or how they had to go out and milk the cows, feed the chickens and chop wood every morning before having to walk to school,in the snow, with bare feet?

I was going to wash what I’d worn hiking, but then I started thinking that I’d just have clean ticks in my basement. Logically it made sense to burn the contaminated clothes. Unfortunately those clothes had been thrown in the laundry basket… which of course was in the closet with all the other clothes.

I headed downstairs and shoveled a bowl of Kashi cereal into the machine before lacing up my shoes and stepping out into the predawn darkness to go walking.There would be time to catch another hour or two of sleep before work when I got back if I needed to.

The Granite consortium, as they had been known, were said to be close to a deal with Lufthansa last year to purchase BMI Regional for between £20m and £25m, with plans to expand services offered to UK business passengers. But the deal faltered due to problems with……

Enters agnosticism: Maybe there is something to this “god-thing,” but there is truly no way of knowing. Something or someone possibly created all that we see long ago, but whatever or whoever it was is either gone or doesn’t care.
Today Johannes is back in his own bed; in fact, he came home the same evening. His face does not droop. His arm is not limp, and it is as strong as it was before this event. The assumed cause of the matter the doctor says was a probable seizure and/or a TIA, something less than a stroke, that may lead to a stroke.
The jury's out - hopefully for a long time to come. I don't think I'm ready to answer those end-of-life questions quite yet. Get back to me in thirty years or so. Eerie, though, how we hoard our ambitions and put off doing til tomorrow what we should have done years ago. Maybe it's a wake-up call to think of the questions we'll be bound to ask ourselves at the end of our journey.

I know full well that if that ever gets conveyed it will be more in lines of “My mom was mad you told us those jokes.”

Okay, just about finished. If you’ve been out to their website, I’m sure that you’ve seen the Menu. I enjoy it all but I especially like their “Hamburger Steak” plate. It’s a good size portion.
How about you stop spoiling before I can eat you? I have managed to throw away wonderful food stuffs out of my refridgerator all because I didn’t have the time nor memory to eat you. If you never went bad this would not be a problem.

For those of you who are so inclined, there is a tag scene after the first set of credits. I honestly wasn’t a 100% sure what it meant, but perhaps a more comic book savvy person would understand it more fully.
The next morning, I got a text message, saying “It is a long time until friday….” I replied “My feeling also”. He ‘phoned and we moved the date up to the next evening. I arrived at Mes Amis, to find him leaning against the doorpost in his now familiar position. He looked so handsome and dashing….
Irene, her mother Simone and brother Dorian leave Paris to move to Normandy; Simone has taken a job working as a housekeeper for an engineer/inventor named Lazarus Jann. Hannah, the maid, conveys all the town gossip and tells the tale of the disappearance of Alma; Ismael, Irene's soon-to-be boyfriend, has Alma's diary. One dark and stormy night, Hannah finds herself in a room she's never been in before, and is somehow convinced to uncork a small flask - a dark shadow escapes.

Now, this is not just about happiness in your profession; it can be someone who you want to learn from about having a better marriage, being a better parent, having better health or a stronger spiritual life.
His grip is steady when he shakes your hand. When he mildly affirms: "My name is McArthur Pratt," you do not doubt it. Before a dusty waif can, McArthur puts out his own hand, beseechingly. The child hands over his last remaining penny, bemusedly. In a flurry of limbs, swifter than the child's eyes, two pennies clatter in the bottom of his enamel tin. The child peers in. When he dares look up, McArthur is not there.
A couple of days ago however I was down with an ugly chest cold and just couldn't breathe enough to be comfortable so I took my butt to the pharmacy. LOVE Mexican pharmacies, you just walk in, say, "I want Viagra, Valium, Oxycotin, a couple queludes and um.....an inhaler." and they'll just bag the shit up and ring up your order. NO, I've never bought those things but it's cool that they're there if I ever decided to become a druggie or my hubby goes limpy, and the inhaler part is a plus.

I ordered this for myself, Vietnamese Rice Vermicelli with a pot of sour spicy soup over a hot mini stove, with fresh prawns, celery, tomatoes and bean sprouts. Nothing special about this main dish, quite ordinary, I still prefer the appetizers!
In the United States, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) is the most widely used set of symptoms. The DSM-IV-TR is a sort of encyclopedia of mental health disorders. Psychiatrists write the DSM-IV-TR and use a medical model for interpreting behavioral symptoms of mental health problems. It is important to know that this is the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the diagnosis of autism has been handled differently in each edition. As we learn more about a disorder, changes are made in the diagnostic criteria. The new diagnosis book, the DSM-V, is scheduled to be released in 2013, and it may bring substantial changes that will probably result in a narrowing of the diagnostic criteria and the number of people receiving a diagnosis of autism under the DSM-V. Outside the U.S., the ICD-10, the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases, which is published by the World Health Organization, is used. Since autism is diagnosed in individuals all over the world, it is important to recognize that the DSM-IV-TR is not the only tool used for diagnosing individuals.
We could sip together huddled in this corner. There is a little spot of beauty to gaze upon across the room. Antique doors just installed! They provide a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.

We had planned on visiting family in upstate New York for the weekend. We expected to enjoy a lunch with one part of the family and dinner with another part of the family (our routine for the last several years). This is baby girl's first Thanksgiving and we were excited for her to get to see so many family members. Unfortunately our transportation fell through at the last minute, and we realized we would be spending Thanksgiving on our own in New York City.

We walked and talked and glanced at this and that .. much of it has become too much of a Been There Seen That sort of a thing. But we walked through the Design Center because it was warm .. not outside in the cool wind.
It’s very important that you look at complete albums shot by the photographer you are interviewing. You don’t want to see a highlight or “greatest hits” album with the best shots they’ve ever taken. You need to know that he or she can capture every moment from getting ready through the ceremony and reception and take great formal shots too. If a potential photographer is not able to show you a complete album you may want to meet with someone else. That’s a red flag.
Since you will not be using sex, you might as well get clear on what you can use. You can use three things.

She loves nature, does Annalise. She lives it. I have been many incarnations of mommies, in our play, and, when I am not her natural Mommy, I often am asked to adopt her away from a home where she was not being treated well...

Caught on the wrong foot over the detaining of Khan at a US airport twice in less than three years, Washington had on Friday asserted it was not a case of racial profiling or a pattern. Suggesting that Khan was not “detained”, but “simply delayed”, State Department spokesperson Mark Toner told reporters: “I wouldn’t necessarily look at this as some sort of pattern but rather two separate incidents.”
We can’t seem to believe it… because the people around us make it seem as if its untrue.
These questions just lead to frustration. I feel like people think I am NOT dealing with it. That I should be doing MORE to deal with it. I get statements/questions like?
Friends described Collins as a loving, caring person. She was an avid reader, a gardener and an amazing cook, Damron said. Collins and her husband, Ken Vinson, had no children.

Unless you lot are all vegetarian, and never wear leather etc, or use/eat any other product derived from animals, you have no right to criticise and essentially are a bunch of hypocrites. Wearing and using real fur and skins should be perfectly acceptable — especially if ithe animal is not endangered, has been killed as quickly and humanely as possible and the other parts were also used.
Well that's all of my rambling for now! Hopefully I'll have good news to report later about our auction, going to D.C. (my fingers are crossed), and hopefully I'll be feeling better too.
The only bad thing about curries is the prep time. I chopped vegetables until I thought my eyes were going to cross.

Remember that earlier we quoted Romans 6:14. “We are not under the law but under grace.” Saul was water baptised to wash away his sins under the law but after the dispensation of the grace of God was made known there is a new baptism as pointed out in 1 Corinthians 12:13.
The Wilmington area offers something for everyone. There are, of course, beautiful beaches that attract surfers, but there’s also great shopping, dining, attractions, galleries, historical sites and museums.
Tip Six–Shop With a List
The immediate gratification is obvious: walking around in my underwear, singing at the top of my lungs, eating and drinking out of containers, doing or not doing dishes and not making the bed are all options that will only piss off one person: me. This place only gets as messy as I let it, and if it does, it's my mess, so I don't care. No one that requires conversation in the morning, things are always in their place, food lasts as long as I let it, I never have to watch a football or baseball game... the list goes on and on.
Buy a vintage quart-sized canning jar at an antique store (usually around $5) and fill with the following ingredients. Tie on a tag with the baking instructions and throw in a new wooden spoon or vintage pot holder and this gift is good to give.
