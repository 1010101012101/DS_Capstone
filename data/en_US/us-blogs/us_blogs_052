It’s fair to say that you will obviously have to adjust your exercise programme as your pregnancy progresses, but hopefully the health benefits exercise offers, will motivate you enough to keep active and keep moving.

Anyway, I digress. I really wanted to talk about how brilliant The Avengers was but I shall write about it in full when my brain un-short circuits itself from the AWESOME. Joss Whedon is FLAWLESS holy shit. I don’t know how they managed to divide the screen time pretty equally between all the main characters – and you know there were many. uGH SO GOOD THAT I’LL ELABORATE MORE ONLY AFTER MY SECOND ROUND OF WATCHING IT ON FRIDAY, K.
When I got there he was still in the ER, all hooked up to wires and tubes. He looked ok though, lethargic from the drugs they gave him, but otherwise his normal self. Just being there calmed me.

It was also really exciting fun to watch couples walk down the astro-turf sloping ramp, joyful with keys in hand. This couple met in NYC but refused to tell me where they met....hmmm, one can only imagine the delightful story shared by two secret NY lovers, or, at least, NY lovers of secretes...

Lee’s arrest and death should be a nice way of ending the whole trial saga with both Jack and Daniel but considering the damage it’s caused with Declan and Charlotte as well; it’s not going to be that easy. Declan couldn’t be swayed when it came to discrediting his former girlfriend’s reliability as a witness and that too was something of a conflict to watch.

We all know that size is really a deciding factor in basketball, however, we proved that even though we lack in size and height, the skills of our athletes are definitely among the greatest in the world and that the heart and courage that they bring into the court cannot be measured.

3. Feel Deeper - I had a sheltered childhood when I was growing up. Never knew what poverty or being less privileged meant. But I still remember my Dad bringing me National Geographic magazines and BBC documentaries to read and watch(there was no cable when I was growing up), so that I could know what was going on around the world. I have cried buckets watching them and then when I moved back to India and saw those conditions with my own two eyes, I felt really felt this need to DO more. I believe that Till you can FEEL their pain, you know you are on the positive track. You are a good person. When you stop feeling, it means there is some part of your heart thats not alive. Feeling another’s pain and trying to DO something about it brings about an immense sense of happiness and satisfaction within. Try it. Just Be there and lend your loving hand to someone everyday…..feel deeper to be happier.
I really hope you are liking these Critters, I am getting some lovely comments, which I REALLY appreciate.

I keep mentioning how I am picturing the background. Here is a quick mock-up that I made in photoshop as a way of planning how my final background will look. I haven't made my background yet in real life, but I want you to get an idea of how it will change once I airbrush it. I will need to make masks and carefully plan my airbrushing. Using Photoshop is a cheater way of seeing how it will look without doing all the work (or making a mistake on something I just worked so hard on). Hopefully this week I will have a chance to show you how to actually make this background with the airbrush system.

Anywhoo. The BoogeyMann was published and edited by a small publishing press by the name of May December Publications. I’ve had several short stories accepted by them, so sending them a novel was obviously the next step. The book is intended for young adults, but it has content that adults will like. Because let’s face it, you can’t write for the young crowd until you please some very critical adults who stand in the way of your publication. So the book gets its title from one of the main characters, Bryan Mann, who is the father of three children–Benjamin, Kayla, and Chloe.

Lymph is a clear- to yellowish white fluid made up of white blood cells, especially lymphocytes, the cells that attack bacteria in the blood. A portion of lymph is comprised of a fluid from the intestines called Chyle; chyle is a milky white fluid containing emulsified fat and other products of digestion, formed from chyle in the small intestines and conveyed by the lacteals and thoracic duct to the veins (Dictionary.com definition). Lymph in the body is analogous to your cities sewage system…nobody pays much mind to it until stops working properly or gets clogged.

So that didn’t sit well with me. But it’s kind of one of those things . . . blurry. Did he do anything inappropriate, or was I just imagining things? Being paranoid and putting my own spin on what is really completely innocuous? It’s unsettling to just not know for sure, and therefore to not know what to do about it, if anything.
PICO NEIGHBORHOOD — Santa Monica’s Woodlawn Cemetery has made the move from final resting place to the only place that a bereft family has to go after the loss of a loved one in an attempt to improve its service and its bottom line.
The first pair of shoes that I studded was in 1985. Remember Avia brand shoes? I used hex-head screws on a pair of Avia's with about 200 miles on them. I was awe-struck by the sudden increase in traction. I felt completely confident and secure on the packed snow and ice, from that point on. Nothing, (other than windchill) would stop me from running through the winter again, from that point on.
The band for my first wedding reception was so wonderful I'd hire them again. Except I'm not up to hearing one single more rendition of the Chicken Dance or Proud Mary. So instead, we'll opt for karaoke. Wedding guests will be forced to have their names checked against my "Approved Singer List." (Sorry, Mom, but you'll be noted on my "HELL NO List.") I will likely climb on a table and belt out American Pie at least three times. The crowd will applaud with gusto no matter how off-key I am because, again (see the previous paragraph), I am the bride and this is my damn day.
“Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.“ (1 Peter 1: 10-12)

Torture is old news. We don’t do it anymore. Fine. Nor have we prosecuted anyone for it. The people who did it are free to make and defend other decisions. How sure do we have to be about a target before we tell a drone to fire a missile at it? How many villagers is it worth incinerating to blow up someone who might be someone who has some position in some group potentially affiliated with al-Qaida? How many of your phone calls and e-mails should the NSA intercept and read? The people who supported the vaccination campaign are the people who are making these judgments, and other judgments we know nothing about, every day.

A slight, nimble figure, Hall expressed a variety of talents at an early age, latching on first to journalism, writing for many city newspapers while working his way through New York University, graduating in 1844. Next came a love for the law, attending both Harvard and Cambridge before heading to New Orleans to start a small practice. He then returned to Manhattan and swiftly maneuvered through the courts to become the assistant district attorney in 1850 and a short time later to even argue a case before the state Supreme Court -- all before he was 25 years old.
Zusha Elinson from the Recorder has an excellent piece on IV's alleged foray into patent litigation, where the article covers the saga behind Picture Frame Innovations LLC who recently filed suit (see complaint here) against Kodak and CDW, seeking millions of dollars in damages. Elinson tracks the history of the patent, the inventors, owners, and even looks at the attorneys handling some of the behind-the-scenes matters to show IV's involvement, and concludes that the litigation represents "a new phase" in IV's business model.

With this romantic notion in my head, I was intrigued by an old House & Garden article which featured the Irish country home of a Mr. and Mrs. Francis Guth. The Guths spent half of the year in Spain (how exotic) and half of the year at Ilecash, their County Cork Georgian house. Mr. Guth was (is?) a great gourmand whose specialty was Spanish food. (A gourmet for a husband sounds awfully nice.) And a quick glance at the photos showed me that they liked to picnic by the river. Sounds quaint. But then I started to read the text, and my idea that country living was relaxing was turned on its head!

When I was first a vegetarian, I virtually lived on salads. I became bored with a diet of ordinary greens, so I experimented with every ingredient I could find, even bitter greens like chicory, radicchio, and endive. I grew to love them. To those bored with the ordinary and mediocre, I suggest they acquaint themselves with Harvey Osgood and sample a more exotic diet. Soon, you will learn to love him as I have, much as one learns to love bitter greens.
Then there's the ingredients, which is sort of like the rules we follow when writing. We need some suspense, but not too much. We need a lot of conflict, but only in good taste. We can't headhop in the same scene, or drop eggshells in the batter. We can't change tenses halfway through the story, nor can we change what we're cooking halfway through the recipe. (unless you're Rachel on Friends, and make half a Shepherd's pie and half a dessert Trifle...in the same bowl. HAHAHAHAHAHA. That show gives me such hope!)
If you’re craving something sweet, try a fruit smoothie with antioxidant-rich pomegranates, raspberries, blueberries, bananas and/or apple juice. Berries are a low-glycemic option and a better choice than the tropical fruits like mango, papaya and pineapple. Skip the sugary sorbets and frozen yogurt additions and ask for whey protein instead, along with a boost of spirulina (a type of algae high in trace minerals, protein and Vitamin A), or greens. This will turn a “sugar-bomb”into a filling, healthful snack. Some of the major nationwide chains also offer wheat grass, which of course is a super nutrient and a great way to boost your daily nutrition (although an acquired taste). Look for salads or healthy wraps at these locations, too.
People used to speak quite differently,and we must grow aware of how different it was,for we have to speak like that again,only on a different level of consciousness.

In other news, I tried The Rag and Bone jeans like Gwennie and loved them. They are high waisted, have just the right amount of stretch and fit really well. They actually cover my muffin top which is always key after a baby. This is honestly the first pair of white jeans I actually like and feel comfortable in. I am starting to think Rag and Bone makes the perfect jeans.
Speaking of shitty inconvenience—ever try nursing in the bathroom at Bass Pro? Better yet, have you ever had a baby wailing in his/her carseat and tried to maneuver your boob around so you could nurse without taking the little screamer out of the seat? And what the hell is the football hold? Who knew nursing and yoga were so much alike? I could have advertised my own personal Cirque Du Soleil show and sold tickets each day for about sixteen months collectively.
On Tuesday I decided that some speed intervals were required and so had Jeff Galloway. He drawled that today we will be doing some race pace intervals and, as the weather wasn’t good, I opted for the treadmill. I had put Jeff and his Easy 10k away, but now that the evenings are stretching out I have more time for longer runs and so out he’s come again. It’s nice having that structure. One of the other reasons why I’d stopped using the app was because it was pushing me too hard and I was becoming despondent. Scratch that. I was pushing myself too hard, as usual. I’d got my heart set on subbing 60 minutes for my 10k, from a 65 minute PB. Rather than aim for 59 minutes I was aiming for 55, attempting to knock 10 minutes off my time and I was near killing myself in the process! I am now wearing my sensible hat, have readjusted the app and it’s now set for 10 minute miles. With any luck one mile will be 9 minutes long! The difference, as I told my husband afterwards as we soaked in the hot tub (who needs ice baths?) was that I could easily manage the race pace sprints in the middle of the run, instead of struggling to finish them and sometimes even stopping to walk during them.

I tell you this story and ask you to share it with your students for this reason. Six people’s lives were almost destroyed because of one unkind comment. All the girl who made the comment did was make fun of another girl’s shoes. Surely all of us have done worse. I know I have. If asked why she did it, I’m sure she would say something we hear all too often: “It was just a joke.” The girl likely could never have imagined how far the negative consequences of that “joke” could have reached. But that joke almost destroyed the life of six children. Children in garbage dumps don’t survive long. If their health does not give out by the time they reach adolescents, exploiters or human traffickers prey on them.

It’s currently noon on Saturday, March 24. We are supposed to be at the summit of Wudangshan, the last mountain peak and nearly the final leg of this journey, with less than 72 hours left before our scheduled return to Beijing. After visiting two mountains and a national park all shrouded with thick clouds, fog, cool mist and rain, obscuring what we can only imagine to be some magnificent views, we have finally seen a break in the clouds. The weather outside is delightful, 60 degrees, sunny, clear skies, with just a hint of a breeze, perfect for scaling a mountain and taking in the landscape around you. Yet we sit here in a hotel room writing, rather than hiking our first full mountain here in China.

Someone told me that the glory of God was His goodness. I think that also counts for His love. I look at the cross and I can’t think because Jesus, by any law, should not love us. According to His standards for us, men can divorce their wives if they commit adultery. We have done it countless times and all He says is “I can forgive you. Come back. You need me. I still love you. Change your ways. Don’t you see?I still love you.”

There have been incidents in which a fire has smoldered for years in an abandoned, sealed-off mineshaft, and then the fire, traveling through the tunnels of the mine, and up the roots of dead, dried trees have caused a dying forest to bloom into flames. The rage that sparks a riot can proceed in a similar manner — and the insular, sealed-off nature of a nation’s elite and the willful ignorance of its middle class will only make the explosion of pent-up rage more powerful when it reaches the surface.

My own personal experience is that, as with every country, marriages come in all different shapes and sizes here in France. There's probably no more infidelity here than in any other country in the world. The French just care less about hiding it. And maybe that's healthier. But I can't help but think French women are the losers in all of this. Stoic, long-suffering, but ultimately cheated. My only hope is that Bernadette has been busy with a few extra-marital adventures of her own.

I do believe it is a miracle because as R has said, my marks were 'woeful' (thank you dear).

Faith is a challenging read that attacks preconceptions of what is right.

Faith herself becomes the most endearing character as I winced at each battle scar she earned.
Second stage feels panicky, unreal. Yesterday you were working. Today, you are on the phone making sure everything you put in place is working fine. You will spend hours on the phone or by email double-checking that your bills, your mail, your doctors, your insurances, your investments are all accounted for. Then, even if you try to relax, you can't. You feel as though you committed a crime-of-sorts. You should't be home playing hooky from work. You feel useless, purposeless, empty.This stage can last a couple of months or more.

Alison’s program is most definitely a 12 step program teaching abstinence, however if your type in ‘harm reduction rehab’ her place comes up. But in fact there are only about 9 real harm reduction rehabs in the whole country- the idea of them is too ‘loaded’, if you’ll pardon the pun. I was always attracted to St Jude who has a campus in upstate New York and is a research facility with after tracking and amazing stats. It is not 12 step and is billed as an ‘accountability’ program, through education and is 90 days. We never went that option but it is an alternative for those looking for something non-traditional.

First things first: the 21 Minus contest has winners! I shall be mailing a bag of coffee to the lucky Emily, hopefully sometime today or tomorrow. As we've seen in the past, I am challenged in terms of sending things in the mail, but at least coffee isn't breakable. Le sigh. A fly got into my coffee this morning. They're having something of a fruit fly epidemic at the dining hall. Here's a brilliant idea: if you want to keep the flies OUT of the dining hall, CLOSE THE WINDOWS. You know what's outside the windows? Trash cans. Dumpsters. Know what lives in trash cans and dumpsters? Flies.

And this bothers me. A lot. And it is not a matter of taking out some stitches - because I worked back and forth, back and forth, around and around. Plus the thread ended, and I had to start another one - all these threads, as you weavers know, are intimately connected now, and just taking out some stitches is no longer an option. And I don't want to add more fringe to the already finished part, because it is perfect! The density of the fringe is perfect.

As high school rolled around things got a little better. I was still made fun of though and I was still the odd duck. It was then though that I would finally get diagnosed. I was in the eleventh grade and having issues. I was talking about suicide and having bad anxieties about school so my mom took me to a psychiatrist.

My birthday was last Tuesday, so I invited people to come to a café called Café y Té (which means coffee and tea). A few of us gobbled down some of their tasty desserts and we had a good time chatting. They sang Happy Birthday and for a few seconds during the tune, my friend Cecilia was singing in Chinese and Jo and Freddy were singing in Spanish while the English version continued. :) Later some of us went to a bar called Bambu and got some tapas and drinks. After we ordered our drinks I looked around and laughed...here I was at the bar on my 21st birthday and I was the only one out of the 8 that wasn't drinking alcohol. Haha! I'm just not a fan of wine (or many other drinks).

Frankly, I don't think anyone is very surprised, but if the Coalition tries to claim they can't afford to cut beer duty, or at least freeze it, for financial reasons, then they will be lying, because even some in the Treasury are realising that increases on beer and cigarette duty are increasingly self-defeating and will raise little or nothing. Many people will simply spend the same money buying less, so no tax gain there; some may stop going out altogether. By making the smuggling of alcohol and cigarettes more profitable, the amount lost to the Treasury will continue to escalate, while giving our pubs an increasingly hard time, resulting in closed small businesses and lost jobs. None of this makes any economic sense.

When Dad was transferred to Kilby Penitentiary, which was over 60 miles away (remember that this was in the late 1950′s and early 1960′s and there were no freeways), we visited him every Sunday. Mama got up early each Sunday morning and began cooking the food we would take to share with Dad. I got up early enough to get ready and attend Sunday School and church while Mama got the meal cooked and packed. Mama and Papa never attended, but she made damn sure I went the First Baptist Church in my home town (part of her agenda was that I was to associate with the upper crust of the town – she always said it was just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as it was with a poor man). As soon as I got home from church, we got in the car and made the drive (only two-lane roads) to Kilby. I won’t bore the reader with details of the dreary prison yard where we visited Dad (winter or summer, rain or shine), but I will share memories of my impressions of other visitors, which will give the reader an idea of how skewed my perceptions were. I thought the other visitors looked trashy and sad, and I felt sorry for them. It never occurred me that we were there for the same reasons and we looked none too happy ourselves – we were just a little better dressed.

In my adult life, we haven't been poor. We haven't had to use an emergency shelter, or use a food bank. We have been broke and couldn't afford things, but we could always make our house payment and all the regular bills we had. We had setbacks. Dude lost his job of 18 years and all of a sudden, I was the primary breadwinner, making a whopping $14 an hour. We had two teenagers, orthodontist bills, clothes, sports equipment, insurance, cell phone bills. We made it through.
The track begins an atmospheric, windblown plain as cybernetic crickets chirp subtly in the background. Godwin makes his entry awash in a sea of reverb, imparting a paradoxical sound to the song that simultaneously manages to invoke expansive vistas and also an impossibly intimate space for it to unfurl languorously in. Fender Rhodes piano and synth bass propel the evasive melody forward and shockingly, a touch of vocoder appears on Peter’s backing vocals about halfway through. The song’s dissolute melody always doubles back on the its inorexible pulse forward as fostered by the deliberate rhythm programming. Subtle washes of guitar appear at the fringes of the song to only recede as soon as you notice them.

As regards perjury, we have here a “disconnect” between what the public perceives and what the law is. As I have mentioned before, false evidence does not become perjury unless it is, in law, relevant to the case before the court. I am not aware of anyone being charged with perjury since the Sheridan trial, although there may be charges in the future. It is true to say though that many people charged with a variety of offences never see the inside of a court room, as the Procurator Fiscal or Crown Office decide not to proceed.
“Decent Wages” is Marketing. Meaning a Deceptive Statement used in a System of Economic Slavery (capitalism) to re-package the “Abuse of Life” to appear as a “Fortunate opportunity” For those who have no other choice/option but to take on the tasks that those with money are unwilling to do themselves, but are happy to pay another a “decent wage” to perform. The Term “Decent Wages” makes the Slavery taking place in our world appear commendable.
As the singer of the song reflects, he'd trade all his tomorrows for a single yesterday, holding Bobby's body close to his. Some might reflect that it serves him right for hitching up with a girl who is clearly unhappy simply to accept the name "Roberta", and instead feels the need for shortness and informality so popular in these troubled times. But others will recognise that feeling. As a singer of the same era remarked, you don't know what you've got till it's gone. Best to enjoy paradise before they put up a parking lot - grab the rosebud while it's there - and make the most of hugging Ms McGee before she heads off looking for the home you'll hope she'll find.
Other insect problems is the tomato horn worm. It blends into the foliage surprisingly well for how huge it is. It can defoliate a small plant quickly, but will just damage big ones a bit. If you see one remove it. You usually find it by the damage it does and not by seeing the caterpillars first. Sometimes you will find white cocoons on the caterpillar. If you do leave it, those are parasitic wasp cocoons and you want to encourage them. Trust me that caterpillar will be doing no more damage.

“Before you answer,” Ariela held up her left hand as her right dangled by her side, knife at the ready, “you should know two things. First, I’ll remind you that lies will result in pain for your daughter. And I can tell when someone is lying. Second, I think you and your family were sent here to probe our defenses and reconnoiter our strengths and weaknesses. You may be doing so under duress – perhaps someone else has threatened you or your children and that’s why you’re doing it – or you may be in league with the other attackers. I don’t really care which. I just need to know if I’m right or wrong.”

To go back to nature is to go back to the time of our ancestors who depended not only on each other and the members of their tribes for survival, but on the other members of the living system. Our ancestors did not only depend and rely on each other. They cared for one another, for every being, and for every thing, seen or unseen. They supported one another. They respected each other, upholding the belief that every thing and every being has its own righteous and sacred place which ought to be revered.

1) Dr. Google and I have collaborated to diagnose me with a sun allergy. The diagnosis was first made back in the summer of 2009. See, the first two or three times of the year I lay out or whenever I'm out in intense sun (such as that summer of '09 when we vacationed in Gulf Shores the hottest week of the year) I break out in little pink bumps. When I lay out they're usually confined to just my arms. That summer, though, I broke out over every inch of my body that was not covered by my bathing suit. It was sexy, lemme tell ya. Late last week, we had 80 degree days. I sat outside with the kids in shorts and a tank top and guess what? Sun allergy reared its ugly head. Ugh. This is NOT cool for someone who LOVES being outside.

Publishers will often want to control world rights, because it is to their advantage to do so. If a publisher sells world rights, they will make a commission off of each sale and more importantly, any foreign income will be lumped into your royalty account and never paid to you unless you first earn back your royalties—thus giving a publisher security should your book not sell in the U.S. But agents will also want to control world rights on your behalf. It is a negotiation. In some cases, publishers will end up controlling them; in others, agents. For example, a publisher might offer a major six or seven figure advance, but insist that such a high advance is predicated on their controlling world rights. In other cases, the advance offer may be low, and the agent may insist that the publisher can only acquire the book for such a low advance if the agent can control world rights. In some cases, three publishers might offer matching or similar advances, but one of them may be willing to give up world rights, and that may be what makes the difference. In some cases, the world rights may be very valuable (for example, with a book about European history), while in other cases, world rights may be unlikely to sell at all (for example, a book about American history), and this will affect the publisher’s or agent’s fervor in fighting for them.

Faulkner was an avocate for preservation efforts even in his day. In 1947 he wrote a letter to the Oxford Eagle arguing for preservation of the county courthouse, which he hoped would not meet the fate of the old Cumberland Church, which had withstood the 1864 burning of the Square, but “wasn’t tougher than the ringing of a cash register bell” and had been ruthlessly torn down. Mad as hell, he went on to say, “They call this progress. But they don’t say where it’s going; also there are some of us who would like the chance to say whether or not we want the ride.”

I would like to ask for prayer. I recently had another doctor's appt. for my RA. Come to find out my RA is doing ok right now, but my fibromyalgia is very bad. Worse than I had thought. That explains why my pain is always a 6-8 on scale of 10 every day. They gave me another medicine to try and *sigh* I didn't tolerate this and had to quit taking it. It made my brain feel like it was crawling around inside my skull. :( Short of taking pain killers every day (which I haven't take in a couple weeks. I try had not to take them), I need something else. There is a medicine that is used off label for fibromyalgia and RA call low dose Naltrexone or LDN. I asked if my doctor would try it and he said no because he doesn't know anything about it. :( I go to my regular doctor next Friday and will ask her to prescribe it. I have done extensive research and will take that with me for her to review. Please pray that she will ok this and prescribe it. It has to be compounded at a compounding pharmacy because the regular dose for this med only comes in 50mg and we only need 1.5 mg. There are virtually NO side effects with this and has promising results. Please pray with me that she will give this a try. Otherwise, I will have to look into taking pain medication that I can tolerate. So far, the vicodin gives me itchiness and migraines and the Tramadol makes me itch like crazy. NSAID's kill my stomach as I have a history of ulcers.

I love speaking trainer Jeanne Marie Grumet’s recommendation to take these changes one at a time. Focus on one that stands out to you. For example, for a few weeks you might just work on noticing when you use a question when you really have a statement or opinion to share and work on changing that. Then you might shift to noticing your “justs” and eliminating them.
We even get a scene where Franciscus' character calls up the scientists and gets word that the whole island could blow. He hands the phone to Holden's character to prove the danger of the situation. And Holden...hangs up the phone and walks away. Mmm, them's good plot development, eh?

In addition, when it concerns a musical composition, which contains the contributions of several authors, the Commission proposes a uniform way of calculating the term of protection. Music is overwhelmingly co-written. For example, in an opera, there are often different authors to the music and to the lyrics. Moreover, in musical genres such as jazz, rock and pop music, the creative process is often collaborative in nature. According to the proposed rule the term of protection of a musical composition shall expire 70 years after the death of the last surviving author, be it the author of the lyrics or the composer of the music. The IPKat isn't entirely sure if he has read this correctly, but it looks like the Commission is proposing to lump together musical and literary authorial works set to music and grant a single term. If this is correct, this goes against our traditional notions of how such works are viewed, and the same logic (of treating both works as one) could conceivably apply elsewhere, such as in judging infringement.
The modern circus is usually traced to one Philip Astley, who began presenting equestrian entertainments in a ring in England in the late 18th century. The novelty was brought to the U.S. by one Bill Rickets, and later enhanced (into the kind of show modern audiences would recognize) by folks like the talking clown Dan Rice, P.T. Barnum and others in the 19th century. Unlike its European cousin which ensconces itself in permanent circus buildings, the American circus is itinerant. Like the medicine show and the showboat, our version of circus is about traveling, historically in tents, bringing magic and wonder wherever it is needed.

Yesterday we took the boat over to one of the islands and I was amazed how many children were in boats, and on the island, with no hats or sun protective clothing on their bodies. With all the publicity about skin cancer I wonder how these parents can do that to their children. I have just had a very dear friend die of melanoma and he went through hell. So many operations and drug trials and finally succumbing to brain tumors. I wouldn’t wish his type of death on anyone. Shame on those parents and grandparents who should know better.

When he meets John, they stare at each other, and he projects the word, “Friend!” John smiles. The man assures John that he is not mad, John is not mad, but the attendants are “quite mad.” But then J. J. looks blankly at John. He withdraws, and John realizes that the man now can no longer see his “visible appearance” or perceive him as a “physical object”; John is now “color and shape, without any meaning.” John plays a tune that he’d heard J. J. playing earlier, and the man suddenly responds that that is music, not as the cow hears it, but “lucid” music as only they can understand it. But the attendant interrupts; J. J. is only allowed to play outside, as his music agitates the other patients. At this, J. J. withdraws again and slips into insanity.

I’ve been writing this post in one form or another since the night of October 31, 2009. It’s started out a couple of different ways. One was a fanciful opening passage to the apocryphal but amusingly un-authorized biography of Pete Carroll I’ve been writing in my head since the end of the 2003 Orange Bowl. Another was a long and very unnecessary series of musings on the nature of a charmed life. It referenced thermodynamics, faeries and cold iron, seraphim, standing in front of operating microwaves, Charles Vess, glamors, and the play-within-the-play in A Midsummer’s Night Dream. I suck, though. Those openings didn’t work. They were a bit pretentious, a bit too filigreed. Maybe they’re middle bits, but they are definitely not “Call me Ishmael.” So as always, there is Vonnegut…

This beer is a malty sweet beer, with a mild balancing Styrian Goldings bitterness, yet light in body and ultimately drinkable. There's also Chancellor Pale Ale (4.6% ABV) an American style Pale Ale with Cascade, Centennial, Simcoe and Amarillo hops.

For me personally, the class was extra-special for two reasons. For one, I was a little surprised by the insights that flowed in during class. I had briefly studied everyone’s chart beforehand, yet still found new information flowing in as class went on. Most often, it was sparked by someone’s observation of their own chart. They would state something they noticed, or ask a specific question, and that directed my intuitive eye toward the insight. That is exactly what I hoped for in creating this class and I look forward to more of the same! I hope the insights were valuable to the people receiving them.
I feel the need to post my bloggity, DIY psychoanalytical ramblings but life is getting in my way. In Thought Garden, I started getting into my angst.

He said, "Osborne and deputy premier Clegg have been keen to describe the emergency package as progressive in the sense that the rich will feel more pain than the poor. That is a debatable claim. The budget looks less progressive - indeed somewhat regressive - when you take out the effect of measures that were inherited from the previous government, when you look further into the future than 2012-13, and when you include some other measures that the Treasury has chosen not to model."

This video, filmed in 1931, shows how the pool looked at the time. What is interesting to note is just how choppy the water in the pool seems, and this can possibly explain to some extent the differences in performance between then and now. In 1924, Weissmuller won the 100m freestyle gold in 59 seconds. In 2008, the Frenchman Alain Bernard claimed gold with a time of 47.21 seconds!

The man who partly inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe's character of Uncle Tom was born into slavery on 15th June 1789 in Charles County, Maryland, on the farm of Francis Newman. Newman owned his father and leased his mother from Dr. Josiah McPherson. As a child Josiah witnessed his father receiving one-hundred lashes followed by the cutting off of his ear. The punishment was meted out because his father attacked a white overseer for assaulting Josiah's mother. Later, Newman sold Josiah's father to a new owner in Alabama, never to be seen by his family again.

3) The St. Michael’s Boys Choir Concert at Massey Hall. I first went to a performance of this superb choir over 30 years ago, and have loved them ever since. It is a venerable Toronto tradition to see the boys in their blazers, walk from their school a block south of Massey Hall. The program changes from year to year, so it has a freshness that some classic holiday performances may lack. This year, the junior choir did the most charming musical rendition of “A Visit From St. Nicholas” (The Night Before Christmas). I cannot recommend this concert highly enough.
Jesse spent days outside skinning, boiling down, fighting off the wasps, spicing, and boiling down some more to get three very large batches of ketchup.

By grace you are saved. You were not wiser than other men. It is not you that have chosen Christ to be your Savior; it is Christ the Savior who has chosen you to be his witnesses. It is not you who by depth psychology have discovered the true need of man; it is Christ who through his servant John tells you that the whole world lieth in wickedness.

I don’t know how He did it. On Palm Sunday Jesus was still the Good Shepherd looking for lost sheep. On the last few days between Palm Sunday and Good Friday Jesus was still out there, calling out for His sheep. We do know His voice. He didn’t lie about that. I have heard it; and trust me I wasn’t listening for it. But I did know it when I heard it. Jesus is still searching. I was still found. I am still being carried. I can still touch scarred hands and kissed scarred feet.

But to state something a little less obvious, no matter how much talent is attached to a movie- --and it does not get much more loaded with talent than Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford-- when it has lingered in production hell for fifteen years, not much good can come of it. Fans actually split the time periods of production into eras. There was a time in the early ’90’s when the`story was going to revolve around Atlantis, but Ford wanted to hung up the fedora. Then came word Kevin Costner might be added to the cast as Indy’s brother, but Lucas was off making the Star Wars prequels, so that fell through. Then there was going to be a remaining with Ben freaking Affleck as Indiana. Sheesh.

At 11:30 I stopped at another culvert-under-a-raintree bus-stop. This one was near this place called Shettyhalli and was more used. There were people waiting for buses. So I lay down at one end and after the initial lull while I finished an appy, the questions started. There was a nice guy from nearby who got dropped off by a motorbike. He answered my questions in turn. He was going to town. He lived in shettyhalli, about 2k from there. He was indeed waiting for a bus (one asks obvious questions to make small-talk). Then this grumpy old guy came with a younger man. No, I’m not on a tour of the country.

I finally got so hungry that I had to eat, so I put her in the crib and microwaved the leftover potatoes. I put butter on them, burning my finger in the process. Then I ladelled some of the sour cream over the top. Finally, as her cries reached fever pitch, I opened the cheddar cheese. Gave it the sniff test. It passed. I glanced in, it looked fine. I dumped it over the potatoes and BAM a big nasty moldy wad of cheese poured out and went SMACK into the potatoes.
I wanted a sequined skirt since last fall and I was so happy when I found this baby in J. Crew. It was the last one and in my size too so of course I just had to get it.

A sand colored heel that's surprisingly comfortable by the Olsen twin's line, Elizabeth & James.
Look at the clothing worn by people who live in perpetually hot climates, such as the desert. The clothes tend to be natural, breathable fabrics cut to fit loosely. Not skin-tight and synthetic. The air flow achieved with loose fitting garments is going to increase evaporation, which increases cooling. These people have been living in, and successfully dealing with these hot climates for millennia. They’re not in it for a big house in Worthington Valley. They’re in it because it’s how they survive in a harsh climate.
From the whole of the evidence it seems to result that the High-Church Anglican School of Oxford was Protestant, and, in the spirit of its central teaching, Evangelical, until the direct Popish leaven was introduced by Newman and accepted by Pusey, who, before very long, under the influence of Newman, started on the road towards Rome, and who presently far outwent Newman s advance Romewards, up to the period of his passing across the barrier and seeking a place within the Roman precincts. The Stuart High-Churchmen—the Non-Jurors and their descendants—were Protestants, whereas Pusey adopted Romish doctrine and discipline in all essential particulars—its doctrine as taught by Bossuet, its penitential discipline, the Confessional as administered by priests—some, of whom might have been ordained, as it were, but the day before—and as enforced by spiritual intolerance and moral compulsion on women and children, and carried out in a monastic spirit by means of sisterhoods; all this having been brought about by a persistent subtlety combined with spiritual terrorism, under the inspiration and direction of Pusey as chief guide and master-spirit. The controversy between Dr. Hook and Dr. Pusey, as revealed not only in Dr. Stevens’ Life of Hook but in the volumes of Dr. Pusey’s biography, for which Canon Liddon was chiefly responsible, shows very clearly the wide and deep separation between the Oxford High-Anglicanism of Pusey and that of Dr. Hook, or of the Non-Jurors. As for Pusey himself, his biography proves that under the influence of something like panic, and largely through his contact with Newman, he went over from a sort of Germanised Broad Churchmanship into the Tractarian Fellowship of which he became afterwards the revered oracle. Pusey, throughout his earlier years at the University, had not been taught doctrine by any theologians under Non-Juring influences. The credit for the full Popish development of our Oxford High-Anglicanism must be divided

All this suggests that Kyle Schleigh, rather than Barnes, powered Texas-Dallas’ run to the East title this season and made him deserving of the nod as East POY. Again, none of this is to degrade Chris Barnes, as he is a fine basketball player and may possess excellent immeasurables. Rather, this exercise has been to show that the best player in a league may not be on the best team, and even if he is, then it may not be who you expect.

So, desperate times. I hit my favorite thrift stores hard, beginning on Wednesday and continuing through today. I scrounged up 7 pairs of pants for W.B., some long-sleeved shirts to get him through the fall, and a new winter coat. I found 7 or 8 tops for myself, most work-friendly, all virtual duplicates of clothes I have owned in the past. I tried on and bought a pair of jeans so flattering that I said, "HO-ly shit" when I first pulled them on. (Sadly, they are too long in the leg so I couldn't start wearing them immediately. And in case you're wondering: Talbot's. Talbot's! They don't look it though). And I pulled several skirts out of the closet that had not fit for several years, and guess what? Most of them fit me again. Can I get another 'woohoo'?

Reading Pub Curmudgeon's blog post on schlooners got me thinking about what happened on the weekend. We were drinking on Saturday at the Brewdog Camden, they have boards written up with the various beers and prices per servings. Prices in this bar are not per the pint but per the serving size they indicate on the board so for example Punk IPA was price per pint but Dogma was priced for a 2/3 schlooner.

I know many of you saw the Diane Sawyer 20/20 special "Children of the Plains," and I let it pass by without much comment on the blog.

They were a major phalange in the destruction of our drama in The Culture War through nihilist and then subversive drama. Their technical abilities are excellent and their facility for embodying nihilism and ideology into dramatic form exemplary. An aspiring young playwright would do well to study their use of styles and genres to explicate their message. Their works were frequently televised, films were made of them and they were performed in many countries especially on Broadway.
Another reason I don't believe this will happen, is case and point in my town, we're pretty segregated. This town is overwhelmingly white. There is no black side of town, because there aren't enough black people to have one. I know my town isn't some anomaly, but I would venture to say, most places are self imposed segregated. So if you are a minority in a particular place, and businesses decide to discriminate against a minority, it wouldn't matter to them, and you will be left driving further and being inconvenienced simply because your skin tone isn't pleasing to a business owner.

Before I knew it I was hanging onto two pieces of rope holding myself together so I didn’t plummet again. How in the world did this happen…? I asked. I wasn’t sure how I would get back to solid ground after all of this but I wasn’t falling. I saw the bridge for what it was again…damaged and rickety, full of hidden cracks. Why wasn’t I more careful?
No matter what anyone says, there are things in everyone’s past that they are not exactly proud of. Though this is the case, we need not feel hopeless. Our future is still unwritten.
Thank goodness we’ve had a mild winter with unseasonably warm weather the last month since I’ve been home from our two winter vacations. Not because I can’t function in cold weather (although I do pretend that is the case if it gets me out of doing something unsavory), but because my younger son didn’t actually need his birthday gift back in mid January. The poor neglected baby didn’t have his parents home on his birthday. We were gallivanting through the Polynesian Cultural Center in Hawaii while said goodbye to 31 and hello to 32. I really need to work on him and his brother (who is older by 22 months) to start lying about their ages. I can’t possibly have children that old!

Scrapbook pages I like to layer up the papers & embellishments & often don't mat my photographs, this keeps that clean line that seems to happen even when I am trying for a more textured, 3D look. My pages rarely end up looking as they do in my mind, because I tend to allow it to evolve as I create.

Our yard is full of roots from a huge white maple. Like huge roots. Like 4″ in diameter. I thought I took pictures before they cut the biggest one out, but apparently I was so in awe I forgot to snap a pic. So here it is out of the hole. Crazy I say.
Each year the PAGB puts on an exhibition of the very best of amateur photography in Great Britain, this exhibition tours the country with an exhibition organised each month by a federation, to be exhibited in their region. To select the work for each exhibition they ask all the federations to put forward the best work from each of the clubs that make up the federation. The exhibition consists of around 150 prints, split between colour and monochrome based on the strengh of each section.

I will miss the insider camaraderie that exists between my co-workers though I will not miss the frustrations that come with the job. I will most definitely not miss supervising 48 of someone else's little darlings in the cafeteria or the cacophony of slamming lockers and end of day confusion as I herd them off to the open maws of the waiting buses.

With the closure of the Exchange, the Dalkey Book Festival will find itself without a bookshop this year. In June, thousands of tourists will flock to the village to spot their favourite authors. Maeve Binchy, Neil Jordan, Declan Hughes, Martina Devlin, Brian Keenan, Joe O’Connor, Don Conroy and Sarah Webb, all live within walking distance of the shop. As one local sardonically points out, “you can’t throw a stick down the main street without hitting a writer. And there are plenty of writers we’d like to hit with sticks around here…”

I also remember being hotter than I had ever been before. I felt like I wanted to tear off my skin. The ambient temperature was nearly 100 degrees even though it was starting to get dark and the humidity felt suffocating. I was still unwilling to admit to feeling less-than-adequate, so I stumbled around campus like a drunk, trying my hardest to keep my spirits up. "I can do it!" I thought. "I just have to believe in myself!" It was pathetic.

“Humility is the noble choice to forgo your status, deploy your resources or use your influence for the good of others before yourself. More simply, you could say the humble person is marked by a willingness to hold power in service of others.” – John Dickson
I'm writing the next one now - my FIFTH novel, wow, it feels amazing to say that. It's set down by a beach so I'm finding it a bit tricky, with all this snow on the ground, to write lovely sunny beach scenes. Luckily I have booked a holiday - ahem, I mean research trip - in order to help me with that!
Here is a picture of the kitchen counter before I used the Soft Scrub Total Kitchen on it. Doesn’t that look gross? I really made a good mess that night. If you noticed, I said that I attempted to make brownies. It’s a long story, but it didn’t go so well. Haha! I’m usually an ok cook, but that night could have gone better. To get to the point, the kitchen was really messy. So, I decided to take the chance to use my Total Kitchen cleaner. I simply sprayed the mess with the Soft Scrub Total Kitchen and…

I grabbed everything in the first picture below for her. The retail price was $486.00. Her price was $186! This included 3 Lego sets which were 50% off. Hopefully she's all set for birthdays for the year.

Many people start off going to church because we have problems. We’re hoping God will give us a little boost to get over the hump so we can get back to saving ourselves, and pursuing our deepest wish. We’re missing it. God is never a means to an end and Jesus will not be used. I have so many dreams (and so many defects and failures I would love to see Jesus heal), BUT, if I never achieve another success on this earth, I cannot explain the way He has quenched the thirst in my heart and given me a purpose every day that is the absolute zest of life. Let Him fill you first and then he even ADDS hopes, dreams and desires to your game plan that he empowers you to accomplish them with brand new strength every morning. It is the best.

We could argue all day over detailed political positions, and even if every one this protest group supports gets enacted, that still isn’t enough, it still won’t cure the rot corrupting the heart of our once great democracy. No, our problems go far beyond simple (or even complicated) policy issues. These people in New York seem to understand that in a way the politicians, corporations, interest groups and the media don’t. Hence, they just don’t understand or know how to deal with a protest that isn’t based on a catchy slogan or in direct opposition to a specific law or policy action that can be summed up on a tee shirt or bumper sticker.
Being able to function without horrible pain is such a huge blessing for me. I feel like my prayers over several years are being answered. Why now? I don't know, but I do know He does and my faith is in His wisdom. I'm going to need that wisdom as to not overdo myself because it is so easy to now. But, even with the pain gone, I must be careful with my Myasthenia Gravis. I still get weak and can get into emergent trouble if I overdo.
Yet in Matthew chapter 15, the parable of the prodigal son tells the story of a father who acted in a distinctively countercultural manner, prompted by love. When the son finally decided to return home after squandering his inheritance in riotous living, his father ran to embrace him. This son had treated his father with utter contempt. Simply asking for his inheritance was the equivalent of saying he wished his father were dead. Yet when his sin was spent and he finally decided to turn away from it, his father met him more than halfway; and he ran.
In line with my previous post, there is this piece from the politically correct, multicultural 'conservative' site, AT. The writer's name is familiar; I believe I linked to one of his articles before, and not in an approving way.

Beginning May 5th the Chesapeake Exploration Center on the Kent Narrows will be open on weekends. The nonprofit Kent Narrows Development Foundation (KNDF) is funding the weekend staffing of the building from May – October. The facility previously was closed on weekends due to budget cuts. “Our goal is to strengthen participation and interest in the community,” said Dick Smith, who chairs the Foundation. “This is our opportunity to give back and help support tourism in the area.” KNDF also is making improvements to the interior of the building, which will include expanded exhibit space featuring a variety of displays from art groups, historical societies, and private individuals. The Center will be open on weekends in May from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and June through October from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Center is located in Chester at 425 Piney Narrows Road, on the water right next to Piney Narrow Yacht Haven.

Hey, guess what? Wicked Wednesday is back again after a long break, partly because of the A-Z Challenge and also because of the fact that I just haven’t watched any horror films for ages! Last night though I did get around to watching one that became available.

Let's assume the bill passes. Even if it was the most kick-ass, studiously written, comprehensively wonderful bill of all time, the NHS still has to find 20 billion or so in "efficiency savings" *cough, CUTS cough*. Waiting times are rising, standards are falling, wards are closing, midwife numbers are dropping, A&E waiting times are soaring and there are fewer nurses. By 2015, the stats will read like a car crash. And remember, this is without the bill.
This is a hilarious game. I had to edit some of it for my kids (they are 14-19) just because I didn’t feel it was appropriate for our home but it is stuff you can work around. The cars and houses that you have to buy are actual pictures of real homes and vehicles. I would hope that people don’t live in things like that or drive things like that, but I have an uneasy feeling that they do.
Except the turkey meatballs I attempted to create using this recipe turned into a crumbly mess. As I began to get frustrated with the recipe’s lack of cooperation, I also started to feel a bit silly. I’ve made plenty of dinners and dishes before – why am I letting meatballs defeat me this one time?
Then I looked at my tulle, which I knew I wanted to be the bottom tier. I had enough for about four 8″ strips, each about 2.5m long, I thought. Which would give me enough for 10m on my bottom tier. It didn’t seem unreasonable as Sugardale suggested 8m for the bottom tier. (A basic tiered skirt for tribal bellydance is a 10-yard skirt, that is, like mine, it has 10 yards/m at the bottom. Yes, I know that a metre is longer than a yard, and the difference adds up to quite a bit once you have 10 of them. Hush, this conversion is the least of my problems. Of the two full-size ones I’ve made, one is about 22 metres at the bottom, the other is probably around 40-some… it is very, very, very, very full)

n September 1941, when the victory of the German Wehrmacht appeared on all states as final (battles fought at the foot of the Soviet capital of Moscow and Leningrad blockade was imprisoned), the young and talented German physicist, Nobel Prize Laureate Werner arrived in Heynzenberg occupied the capital of Denmark – Copenhagen city where his teacher Niels Bohr. This meeting seems to be the crucial in the history of the development project for the creation of nuclear weapons in Nazi Germany, because after a conversation with Niels Bohr, Werner Heyzenberg not be refused, and continued his studies in favor of Nazi-related uranium project. But what the two scientists have spoken? This has not as yet become known. After the war, German physicist provide the public with several versions of a conversation, and Niels Bohr refused to comment on the case and took with him the secret to the grave. It is only known that three months after the return of Werner Heyzenberg Copenhagen, German supreme military command refused the implementation of nuclear projects, which in Germany at the time, regardless of country occupied by it, or not enough resources or staff. Instead of building a bomb it was decided to develop research related to the creation of a new aviation and rocketry. And today is still an open question whether the German physicists were unable or did not ask to create the atomic bomb.
If you look at the above picture, in the foreground, you see some stakes. Yes, oh yes, this is where a farmer grows white asparagus and many times during the week we would walk down there and buy the fresh, white asparagus for our dinner. Very inexpensive and so very, very good. I have often thought that one of the reasons we like to travel to Europe in the early spring is because of the white asparagus.
Picture this: your sweet 1 year old child is lying on the floor screaming. You ask what this sweet child wants, and the screaming escalates. You then run around the room holding items up…”Do you want your milk?” “Oh I bet you want your paci!” “You want to read your book?”….and the game continues. Waiting for your child to be able to express a want or need can feel like an eternity, especially when you have a 1 year old lying on the floor in a meltdown. It is a frustrating experience for you and your child when your child is not able to communicate a need or something he or she is excited about. In recent years many parents have begun signing with their children. Some ask, “Is this just another passing fad or another attempt to make our children “super kids”?” Others ask, “Won’t this delay verbal speech?”
Dick Clark's uncle Bradley was married to Margaret Kessinger, daughter of Albert Kessinger, owner and publisher of the Rome Sentinel newspaper. In 1941, following the death of her father, Margaret inherited the business and husband Bradley took over as publisher. Bradley, in partnership with one of his editors named Fritz Updike, started WRUN-AM (the initials of Rome-Utica News).

To preempt rebuttals from those who defended PNoy (Ipasa side); the critics (in the form of columnists and disparaged cabinet secretaries of the former administration) blurted out un-merited prejudices, unsupported claims of PNoy’s inadequacy, irrational arguments that can make the mind bleed with a mixture of disappointment and disgust.

Along with modern astronomers, Settele does not teach that the sun is at the center of the world: for it is not the center of the fixed stars; it is not the center of heavy bodies, which fall toward the center of our world, namely of the earth; nor is it the center of the planetary system because it does not lie in the middle, or center, but to one side at one of the foci of the elliptical orbits that all planets trace. Still less does he teach that the sun is motionless; on the contrary, it has a rotational motion around itself and also a translational motion which it performs while carrying along the outfit of all its planets. (From Olivieri’s November 1820 Summation, titled, “Ristretto di Ragione, e di Fatto,” ¶30, as cited by Finocchiaro in Retrying Galileo, p. 205.)
We set up our base on Cylinders beneath the ocean. In as deep a place as we could find. And we formed our plan. We would grow our population. From the two hundred of us that arrived until we numbered in the hundreds of trillions. Most of us would be nano-machines. Microscopic. We would spread through the air. Through the water. Through the ground. We would live in the plants. In the animals. And ever in the humans.

3. The bibliography – it’s so huge that you cannot follow it throughout the book. I gave up after the first chapter. It is a result of the author’s excellent research so can’t blame him for it. It’s just that it was too heavy for a reader like me to go back and forth at every reference.

That's not quite true, is it now? If the BBC is lobbying for this unutterably trivial amendment, it would strongly suggest that they stand to benefit from it—by, for example, not having to spend hours pissing around with CGI. Companies don't generally lobby for policies that won't benefit them, y'see. The tobacco industry, on the other hand, is not lobbying for it and stands to gain—at best—the sale of a couple of packs of cigarettes to be smoked in some god awful period drama.

Bezmenov provides several real world examples of how Marxist leaders even execute and/or imprison each other. Also he explains how American embassy employees were known to betray Soviets attempting to defect, how there existed a “triangle of hate” in the Soviet government, why he realized that Marxism-Leninism was a murderous doctrine, and how the CIA ignored (or didn’t care) about Communist subversion.
Presently at 130% of U.S. civil service salary, the UN wage is seriously inflated. This is out of touch with reality, and it has not proved successful in recruiting or retaining talent. On the contrary, it has become a magnet for those who want a UN job only because it pays well.

The militant atheism behind this month’s upcoming “Reason Rally” on the Mall in D.C. isn’t the only flavor of skepticism these days. In fact, instead of blaming people of faith for the woes of the world, some atheists now are actually speaking out on behalf of religion. But their reasons for doing so are as different as one could imagine.
It is indeed time to duel again... Yayyy!!! I am a tad bit late this month but ALOT has been going on lately.
Think about all of the controls we put in place in an effort to lead our children down a specific path: bedtimes, hygiene, food, studies, sports, arts, please and thank you, the words they use, the emotions they have, the thoughts they express, the games they play and the way they play them. We do this with a goal in mind, with an outcome that we think is best for them, with the knowledge that if we can mold them down this path their lives will be better for it, even if they resist in the near term. After all, we reason, we're raising kids for the long term, and our own experience tells us that we know best when it comes to what is right for our kids.

If it isn't evident by now, I am fascinated by the juxtaposition of elements that at first glance seem at odds with each other. You, for instance, can easily come across as a flighty pretty boy whose interests do not seem to go beyond his chichi friends, the drama of his lovelife, or the importance of eyeshadow.

I have received news that as of midnight last night, our area of the country will be directly affected by this rotational strike of Canada Post. I have cringed over and over at the news reports regarding the lack of need for the mail system as the world becomes more and more electronic. I was daydreaming as I drove along the highway the other day about what letter writers would do if the postal system decided to call it quits. I have found these last few weeks frustrating waiting and wondering and holding off. I have had friends who could have used a special card in the mail but I didn't send any. I realize how much I really like the postal system especially today when I opened the mailbox and it was empty. That hasn't happened since last summer. This is such a rare occurrence that I even blogged about it when it happened.

1. The world setting of White Cat is very elaborate. One of the clichés about urban fantasy is that despite events happening in the here and now, they never really affect the real world. White Cat’s very different. The workers are an integral part of society. People hire them for blessings, for beatings, to make sure business goes right for them or badly for their rivals. You establish that charms are very common since people need to defend themselves against being worked and everyone, but everyone, wears gloves. How much time and effort went into building the ground rules for your world?
The foreword to the 1939 'Edible wild plants' describes its author Perry Medsger Oliver, a biologist, as a magnificent guide and a true woodsman. One who quotes Thoreau! Oliver's own foreword confirms the origin of US contemporary foraging as coming from a fascination with the untapped resources of knowledge about nature that are part of the cultural heritage of the native American (although, Oliver believes, only to the intelligent ones); see quote below. There are some interesting differences between this guide book and contemporary ones: there is no mention of poisonous plants; there are no warnings against over-harvesting of plants or the accidental taking of protected plants. There is much space devoted to cultural uses and histories and very little space to the details of preparation (no recipes in the modern sense) because it knows that readers know what to do with a plant and you don't need to tell them to boil the water first. It is from this that you know that this is a book from a time when the handling of a vegetable was a daily chore not a lifestyle option to be bought alongside the new Jamie Oliver book. Did you know that in 1939 dandelions were grown semi-domesticated in New Jersey and sold on New York markets?

The Capitals tied up this series on Monday, with Alex Ovechkin scoring the game winning goal despite not getting a lot of ice time.

What did a teenage girl wear to go save the world? Blue tights and red underwear seemed a little too conspicuous. It couldn’t be a dress, obviously, and shorts were out because my pasty white legs would be spotted a mile away. Plus, it was still on the warm side, so a black sweater wouldn’t cut it. I settled on a pair of black yoga pants, paired it with a thin black long-sleeved shirt and dug out my black Chucks from a pile of clothes on the floor. I pulled my hair back, glanced at the mirror only to ignore my pale, freckly skin. I would not wear a ski mask. The man they called Fortune, who murdered my nine year old little sister, had worn one and I refused to have similarities with him.

Framed between them is one example of Linda's intricate needlework. Jane and Linda are members of In-Town Gallery. When we left the art show, Jane and Tillie and I went to Sweet Basil, a Thai restaurant. I forgot to photograph our food, but I had delicious Pad Thai.
God really did keep me away from a bunch of stuff that could’ve happened and punishments that should have happened but didn’t. I really didn’t notice it at all until I rededicated in commitment my life to God and accepted Jesus as my savior and was baptised. I can see His fingerprints all over my life now and surprisingly it’s mainly in the most difficult times. I remember the pastor once saying that people tend to forget God and get made at Him in times of trouble when things aren’t going well. And I was sitting there like,.. are you kidding? It’s the time I call out to Him most?! But anyways, God’s been working alot in my life now and changing my view of things. He makes me remember past promises I made to Him when I was kid and reminders of sayings I used to say.

Elise has always been the responsible one, so when she receives yet another SOS phone call from her wayward twin, she does the only thing she can do, she steps into her shoes. Having to go back to nannying is hard enough, the unexpected attraction to her arrogant employer impossible to deal with. Especially when she is forced to agree to a marriage of his convenience to pay off the debt her twin accrued.

I now treasure a banged up little digital camera I originally borrowed to make test shots before exposing large format negatives. It's not perfect, but it allows manipulation of a film speed setting, lighting, and exposure. It has been good to me and has served me well as a camera for my thoughts.
We got her her favorite Morroccan Oil Shampoo/Conditioner and some Oil as well! She has been asking me to buy her some for quite awhile so I knew instantly what one of our gifts would be!! We also were able to get a gift certificate to one of her favorite shops in a town nearby. They sell MissMe Jeans, jewelry, etc. She was beyond thrilled!!
I noticed that her flight kept getting pushed back. All of the other flights to the US were still flying: Detroit, JFK, and Minneapolis, just to name a few. Someone did not want to fly to Pittsburgh. It was canceled after being pushed back from 11:10 to 12:30 to 1:45 to 3:20 to 4:10, then canceled at 2:15. What the hell is wrong with you people? You can’t do that to me.
My life, situation and circumstances then – they were pathetic, dreary and dreadful. On 31 October 2005, all I had at that time was all of RM1 (would have been enough to pay the 70 sen bus fare `home’). From having relatively good and secure jobs and with some status in society, I was unemployed, shunned and scorned. Although I had a wife, the marriage had essentially crumbled some years before and all that remained was anger, resentment and bitterness. I was also estranged and cut off from my elderly parents and sisters. I was all alone; abandoned, unwanted… But worst of all was the feeling inside – the self-loathing and hatred of having failed my children; of them suffering through no fault of theirs. This was something that had deeply tormented me.
Now, bearing these facts in mind, the rapidly deteriorating status of the Greek economy, and what’s seen as increasing dependence on Germany and the EU, its no wonder why support for the Coalition, comprised of the once major parties is running at a combined 33%, and according to the latest MRB Hellas poll, only 7% would favour an administration comprised of the two main parties. More and more, Greeks are looking to the margins of the political arena for answers.
In some ways, Chua and the Tiger mothers are taking the easy route. They have picked their goal and are pursuing it with a single-minded fury that allows for no hesitation, no questions, no uncertainty, no doubts. Even as Ava and I rightly decide to go the other way, to value our time as a family over the pulls of the childhood industrial complex, to send our children to whatever university Ava is currently working at, there will always be in my mind the tiny ‘what if,’ the bit of curiosity about whether Polly or Pip could have set the world on fire had they been given the chance.
LAST YEAR yet another official report was produced, this time by Sir Peter North, proposing the reduction of the UK drink-driving limit from 80mg to 50mg. This offered no new evidence, and earlier this year it was rejected by Transport Secretary Philip Hammond, arguing that the vast majority of drink-related road deaths involve drivers well over the current limit, and cutting the limit by itself would do nothing to change their behaviour. For the first time, an official response on the issue actually acknowledged the potential effect on the hospitality trade. Licensees and customers of rural, suburban and small town pubs will no doubt have felt considerably relieved by this decision.
“For by grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God; not of works lest any man should boast.”
So, plan for that inevitable outcome. Organize your patriot militias, not to vainly restore the perfectly intact Constitution, nor to defend it for the benefits of the elite who have owned this country from inception, but to replace it when this house of cards finally collapses under its weight, preserving yourselves and your neighbors within that storm. Then, on the other side, let’s work together to restore the principles of liberty and put teeth into the rights of man with meaningful consequences enforced by local militias, unfettered by those who rightly fear them.
The final detail of His appearance: "He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood" (Rev 19:13). Is this the blood of the cross we are talking about? We are way past that point because the Lamb has now become a Lion, the Prince of Peace has now become a Mighty Warrior. So whose blood or what blood is in mind? Look at verse 15: "He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God" (Rev 19:15). What happens to those who stomp on grapes? Their feet, their ankles, their robes become splattered with juice. What happens to those who stomp on their enemies in the same way as wine makers stomp on their grapes? They become splattered with blood. That is what is in mind here.
The DT Cards and Guest DT Cards are all super, Why not pop over to the Girls blogs to see how they made them and show them some love.
Rachel, the creator of this inventive and informative blog, “The Block” seems like such a sweet and genuine woman. I did not get to meet her but I have her handmade business card which I really like. I checked out her blog and to my sweet surprise, she blogs regularly about all the creative shops and local artisans that many Torontonians seem to miss out on. I am a semi-frequent shopper on Queen West and Ossington, as the old vintage shop area of Queen and Spadina has been completely gutted and replaced with franchise stores. I guess that dates me a bit because this has been the case for years and years. I love to find unique handmade clothing, or items for my home. It just seems like they are becoming harder to find. It scares me when I see Joe Fresh coming into Queen West and Bathurst. Stores like Buckler for men and Response for women are disappearing. Rachel, discovers some hidden gems and teaches us of local options to support and inevitably end up with something super unique. I love her approach to discovery and inspiration. Keep up the blogging!!!

So I will say it now, this blog post is about a dog that is fed using the Raw Meaty Bones model of feeding and it will likely refer to this more as this is what I know. BUT it equally embraces the BARF model (although it believes raw meaty bones should be fed whole NOT ground). Under no circumstances will it tolerate mud slinging by either side, or for that matter a constructive debate about which is best, there are lots of places on the internet for you to get that debate out of your system so please don’t post them here, I will delete them. Debate is good, it helps us to learn and grow but for the uninitiated it can be very off putting and confusing and this blog is about opening people’s eyes to the possibility of feeding raw.

There’s an adjective I use a lot lately in describing life in post-coup Bamako. That adjective is “normal.” Walking or driving through the city’s neighborhoods, and talking with its residents, one can be surprised by just how little seems amiss. And it’s only been three weeks since Mali’s political scene was completely upended and two decades of democratic rule interrupted.

Kirsty goes to her dad’s house but sees Julia inviting in one of the idiots she picked up from a bar. She also sees Frank killing him, and Frank tries to calm her down, but I don’t think that works very well when he looks like he took a bath in a pool of human entrails. And when that doesn’t work, he tries the sexual harassment route that…pretty much makes no sense, being that we never even saw any evidence that he acted that way towards Kirsty before. Movie, if you want to tell a gross-out sub-plot like this, BRING IT IN EARLIER. Don’t just shove it in randomly to shock the audience for two seconds and then discard it later!

When I was little and had no idea that to live required $$$$$! The only thing I lived for was the joy that I found in my heart and shared within the close-knit community of friends and family where I lived. I did not equate happiness with what I had. As long as I could roller skate with Linda or jump rope with Debbie or play ball with Bobby and Chris or have secret late night phone chats with Cecilia, I was happy. I made sweet-smelling clover chains with my friends and wore them as proudly as if they were pearls. We bobby pinned curls in each others hair trying to lay claim to having the latest fashion coif. And with shiny Mary Jane’s beneath ruffled socks and special Sunday dresses worn at no other time…..EVER…..we went to Sunday School!

Though these effects are possible for the same reason, they do not take place entirely in the same context. Fiction might occasionally be mistaken for social realism, while the pair in R & G act in a propless cosmic void. That they have even greater freedom in dialogue then those in Fiction should not understate the fact that both sets of characters have far more freedom in what they might say than those in a story that attempts “realism”.
I’m not sure whether this game will revolutionize first person shooters – there isn’t much here that develops the genre. However it could be something to revolutionize the PS3 itself as it really showcases what a powerhouse the console is.

Yet again, I must extoll the European sensibility of living with extended family. I know...I know...and soon we will indeed fly this nest, but honestly, what seemed like the end of the world has turned out to be one of our greatest blessing. No one circles the wagons like family. Even after a week of being sick everyone rushed to my aid. To play and care for M while I couldn't/can't pick him up. As in pain and wallowing in my own puddle of self pity, I do see how blessed I am. Even though the pain has sapped the funny from my very being...it shall rise again. Like the South. (only not really...the South, not the funny.)

Is God the SHADE in your life? Do you allow him to SANCTIFY your life? This was Jesus’ prayer for all his followers and these are things that should certainly not be taken casually.
The deeper levels of his despair are revealed when he compares the artefacts left in stone, bronze etc down the ages from the first painters on walls of caves, with the futility of human life “whirring in the void of the meaningless universe.” Storey was not an absurdist in technique like Beckett, Ionesco or early Pinter, but through a naturalistic style he describes a universe without meaning, an absurdity. Allat delivers a powerful evocation of a collapsing character: “
Hands up who is looking forward to the weekend!!
Needless to say, hearing that Mr. Seau had passed away today while I was in line at Costco this afternoon was an absolute shock. As more details of his death have come to light, the shock has only grown and the sadness just hasn’t dissipated. There has already been a lot of speculation as to why Mr. Seau would have taken his own life. If I had to guess, I would imagine that some sort of brain injury from his football days played a part, after all, he did play a violent position in a very violent game and he played at full throttle at all times (which is one of the reasons he’s beloved by his fans). Brain injuries (commonly caused by concussions) are so completely misunderstood, even by the “experts,” and no one what the long-term results of them are. If the NFL doesn’t start to really invest some serious money into the research of brain injuries, along with prevention and treatment, then they’re just setting themselves up for a catastrophic proportion.

After getting them tied up and gagged, Jason pleaded that we leave. I calmly presented the case that they were bound and that we had regained control of the situation. I also reminded him that this entire venture would be a lot of risk and effort, all for nothing. Eventually, I persuaded him to stay and finish the task at hand, and assured him I would assume responsibility for the unfortunate homeowners.

Let me start by saying things are going really well with Mark. After my last post we had a bit of a come to Jesus meeting, hashed it all out and the ex-girlfriend is gone. Which makes it possible to move forward and have fun. We’ve been enjoying our time together. I have had some super busy weekends as of late and he’s been working insane hours we have only seen each other about once a week. It is kind of nice that it’s been forced to be slow.
‘Well, the media always simplifies things and they take one incident that happens for five minutes in one year and then that’s your life for the next ten years. But I had all these other moments you know, and the other 364 days in the year were very different from that particular day. I mean, there is still a grain of truth there, but it’s just taken a bit out of proportion.’

hen therefore Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head: and they put on him a purple garment. And they came to him and said: Hail, king of the Jews. And they gave him blows. Pilate therefore went forth again and says to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in him. (Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he says to them: Behold the Man. When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, Crucify him. Pilate says to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him.

So I went back. To find the truth. To find out if the past was real and that it had actually existed. In the centre of Durham, apart from the art deco cinema where I saw all three Star Wars films being boarded up, along with Woolworths, little seemed to have changed since the 1970s. Little seemed to have changed since the 1870s. Sherburn Village lies three miles out of the city. Nothing had changed but everything was different.

I remember with Kira I got to a point where all I wanted to think about was pregnancy and babies and birth. I don't have that this time but I can feel my organisational skills slipping. I feel foggy and tired and the tasks that don't give me joy loom like dark clouds. I'm procrastinating and feeling like a lazy shit. I want to finish my editing course, I have until November. I have a bunch of marketing stuff to be done for school and I am not really sure where to start. Writing is starting to feel difficult - not because I don't want to do it, but because it feels hard to write coherently. Whinge whinge first world problems. Added to that the annoyance of a crap real estate that I seem to have to nag and harass to get anything done... and I just want to curl up somewhere and hibernate.

“When we talk to managers, we often ask, “Do your people trust you?” Most are taken aback. It’s not something they’re often asked or a question they’ve even asked themselves. After some thought, most eventually say something like, “Well, I think so. I hope so. No one’s said he doesn’t.”

But we live a freezer/fast-food lifestyle nowadays, don’t we? I think back to Lyda’s huge meals and Gertie’s bacon grease seasoning and wonder at the fact that people were not any heavier than they are today—in fact, I think we have more weight problems today, don’t you?

But don't take my word for it. Go to Kindleboards.com and look at all the self-pubbed authors selling like crazy. Go to Amazon.com and look at the bestseller lists, which are full of indie authors (who are competing with huge bestselling authors, and in many cases making more money than those bestsellers.) Crunch the numbers yourself, and try to find a scenario where you'd actually do better in the long term by signing with the Big 6.
Even if attending a psychiatric unit and containing a situation took three officers four hours until NHS arrangements took over; this is little compared to the time and trouble it would take to deal with the situation incorrectly and then have to put the wheel back on or deal with the fallout of tragedy. It is also fair to comment, that if the NHS are able to rely upon a police willingness to ‘muck in’ for expediency, what incentive is there to ensure that ward managers have access to proper contingencies for these kinds of situations?

As we have seen, the Bible is clear in its teaching of the kingdom of God, and Jesus made it plain that He was referring to a kingdom that was promised to Him as the Son of David and that would be established at His return. To take Luke 17:20-21, which is a relatively obscure passage, and build one’s doctrine of the kingdom primarily upon it and then use it to overthrow the teaching of many plain Scriptures is upside down hermeneutics. This is the way that false teachers (mis)use the Scripture.

I pulled over into a parking lot and the other car followed me. A teenage girl got out of the car and looked at me like I was an idiot. I asked her, "Didn't you see me?" She flipped out and started yelling, "ME see YOU?! Didn't YOU see ME?" Umm, well, no actually. I didn't. I turned away from her and dialed 911. Actually, I didn't so much dial 911 as I punched 911 as my passcode to unlock my phone. Shockingly, it didn't work. Duh. I came to my senses, unlocked my phone and dialed 911. Isn't that what you're supposed to do? What ARE you supposed to do in an accident? Call the police, right? Or are you just supposed to trade insurance information. I have no idea what to do! Ugh, I got through to 911 and told them the info. No, no airbags deployed. No, no one was hurt. At least I didn't think anyone was hurt. Crap, I didn't even ask to make sure no one was hurt! What's wrong with me? That's the first thing you should do, right? Ohmygosh, my brain wasn't functioning at all.

There’s a big difference, however, between planning to write a smoking-hot sex scene and actually doing so successfully.

I have my post operation appointment (which was rescheduled) coming up this Friday. Hopefully, everything is good. At the moment, I am having a few issues, but nothing to worrisome. I am moving a lot more, and have noticed my drive and determination is in full effect again. I know, I still need to be careful, but I don't need to sit and play on Pinterest or Facebook all day long. So baby steps back to working hard!!
On the evening of February 5th, 2011, while watching TV with my husband, I decided to just poke around Blogger for a bit and explore these things called blogs. I clicked a few design buttons ... thought, hmmmm, I might be able to figure this out ... thought, I wonder what this button does? Thought, what would I call my blog?
I seem to have quite a few people who read this blog that are brand spankin' new to the world of guns and are as ignorant to them as I was(and in most ways still am). Some of the information I assume to be basic is not basic to someone who is "that" new to this world. I know when I read a gun review in a gun magazine or on Guns.com, I am often so overwhelmed by what I don't understand I can't get anything from the review. I walk away still not knowing a flip about that gun. Frustrating!!!

But the top end is where the icons work. There is a bit of trickle-down effect, where what happens on the catwalk influences high-street fashion. It would be unkind to call this sort of influence 'knock off' – at least it shows that someone is paying attention, and that there should be a bit of attention paid to what we wear.
I love snowmobiling. Flying over the snow, catching air over drifts. I love to drive, to be at the helm of the beast as I weave around trees and over hill and dale, my husband sitting behind me. I also love riding behind my husband as he drives, feeling those powerful arms as he's muscling the snowmobile into the wilds. We follow unknown trails, driven by a Magellan spirit, hoping that we have enough gas to get us back to civilization. I love hanging on, simply trusting him, knowing that wherever he's taking me, he's going first.

I finally took her into the bathroom and ran a very hot shower to steam up the room. I pounded on her back as she coughed, and she would move my hand back to her back when I paused. She finally calmed down some, and she asked to get in the bath. So she had an early morning bath. Once she was out and dressed again, we got back in the recliner and she fell asleep about 7am. I was able to put her in her bed, and we both slept about an hour.

Exhibit B: So there’s this guy on the show this season with the biggest forehead ever. It’s so wide, his eyes practically live on the sides of his head, like a fish. So I’ve decided that if I went on a date with him, I’d spend the entire time trying to place myself directly in front of his field of vision. Just to see if I’d be invisible to him.
For a king-sized book (pun intended), it went by quickly. I only felt a little bogged down once, but it didn't last long. And that was probably due to my inability to appreciate long books and no fault of Mr. King. I'm so impressed with his creativity and talent to take an idea like time-travel, and make me believe it! I bought into the storyline right from the start. So why didn't I give it a higher rating? I wonder that, too, even after a very satisfying ending. I suppose it hinges on the not-so-satsifying aspects in-between. I'm sick of the words "obdurate" and "harmonize," and there were missed opportunities to shorten the book. :) Also, I'm not sure why, but I got confused a few times. I think most were ironed out quickly, but a few remain. Maybe reading it myself would have helped with that. Overall, my first Stephen King novel was a huge success!

Yeah, that again. It’s September, and although I’m not a lingerer, this year I’ve found myself going back in time.

Given the limitations of early television technology, it's amazing they were able to broadcast simultaneously between two coasts at all.

There is a vast audience of people out there who, as I said, have never heard of Daniel Yergin, and who have never even heard the words "peak oil." The elected officials who guide our policy will do little to address peak oil and related issues until voters communicate that these are top priorities that will affect elections. Beyond this there is the issue of encouraging personal preparedness, something that is in large part outside the scope of government policy.
AGEN BOLA - Manchester Derby next May 1 is touted as the hottest two teams clash in history. The problem is, the duel could be the key to determining the 2011-12 Premier League champions.
6. my laptop- Basically I could not function without it and more importantly I could not blog without it. I got a new one from my parents for Christmas and it has been used every day since.
That’s it. I’m hooked. After our first batch of beer, I professed how awesome the experience was; how I could see beer making becoming a maybe annual enterprise more or less so I could continue working on my labeling prowess. But after this second batch of pilsners, which we had our first taste of yesterday, I’m all in. While our first two brews, an American Pale Ale and an IPA came out pretty good, these guys are simply fantastic.
need to take a few days and catch my breath!!
There are some days when having children is a blessing. Days when you get to wake them up from their beds and they're groggy and smell like sleep and they smile at you. Days when you get to teach them something new and watch the wonder in their eyes. Days when you can just relax and watch them happily play at a park, without a care in the world. Days when you watch them accomplish something great and days when you realize you're doing a great job raising them.
Over the next five days, the good news was slow going and at times, I almost despaired. Again, everyone had all the sympathy in the world for us, but no one knew what to do. Despairing herself, the woman at the hospital called down to Trenton to ask for help, and found out, on Thursday, that she should have called them all along, and that they have to authorize such paperwork, but that, definitely, we would be able to bury our daughter. God is good because somehow, with the help of many hands, the mess of paperwork and regulations was finally straightened out and our baby’s body was released.

"Matt Edwards goes by many names -- Matthew E, Rekid, Quiet Village, Sea Devils, Radio Slave -- and now you can also call him RedHead. Whereas under his various other guises he creates old-school acid house or electro-pop or disco, as RedHead he makes music that doesn't seem to care very much whether you're interested in dancing, though you can go ahead and try if you want to. "Continental Drift" is the most disinterested of the six very long tracks on this album; it sounds like a ship's mast creaking, with ocean waves, a ride cymbal, and a static but strangely urgent synth chord that sustains itself for the length of the track and, brilliantly, brings out the actual pitch of the creaking ship's mast. It's a very cool, but excessively long track. It's followed immediately by the funky, burbling groove of "Opening Ceremony (Fuse)," which is, oddly enough, saved from monotony by the sudden appearance of a Gregorian chant sample. "Leopard Skin" sounds like something Muslimgauze might have recorded after a visit to the Amazonian jungle; "Talking Dolls" blends an unassuming house beat with dubwise vocal snippets, and "Root People" blends a house beat with field recordings in a manner that brings to mind African Head Charge crossed with Jon Hassell. Only the grim and rather boring "Spell Bound" fails to cast much of a spell; everything else on this album is weirdly brilliant." - AMG

I’ve seen most of the TEN films nominated this year, and of them, here are the ones I thought were better than The Kings Speech:
It’s not that Channel 13 doesn’t have the free speech right to endorse the arena as a civic benefit for the public, it’s that Channel 13 hasn’t earned that right by engaging in the hard analysis that would allow it to reach such a conclusion. The slovenly Charlie Rose interview of Bruce Ratner certainly doesn’t count in this respect. At the very least, Channel Thirteen needs to start with a recognition of the extreme controversiality of the arena and its associated land grab. It should understand why that is.
If you think counting and logical thinking is easy, take this class. You know, I’ve never really had an interest in knowing how many possible turns it would take to solve a Rubik’s Cube, but thank god this class taught me how!
Briefly analyzing all these factors, one comes to the inevitable conclusion: why on earth are you not dragging Chinese shoppers over to Japan in droves? Give them their tacky bottle of baijiu at a place with a table, let them pour it themselves and just keep someone on staff to make sure there’s enough bottles around. Whiskey works too. Why are there more sales people than Chinese tourists at Armani Ginza in rush hour? Take a leaf from Taiwan and buss them around like lined up duckings in perpetual pursuit of stupid sign if you have to!
The path of religion although can bring some serenity and belief to ones lives will not take you that far down the spiritual path to perception,awareness, and enlightenment. religion contains too much dogma within and has been altered dramatically down the ages by the people who run it, and most of the scriptures of any religion can be interpreted to suit the ego. Without question however religious symbology and artifacts can be used to help you along the spiritual path, the cross for instance can be used as a focal point to draw upon the power of the Christ consciousness. any image of Mary can create a peaceful blessing setting, a statue of Buddha can bring calmness and oneness etc…In fact although I am not a christian, I know I follow the ten commandments of god in my 3D bubble reality environment ..that’s what they were designed for, making ours and other people’s lives better here on Earth..they are not really much help when it come to travelling the spiritual path and wanting to understand our true meaning.
In fact, since the infancy of the web, in the mid-to-late 90's -- when the web had far less detailed personal data on us -- click-through rates have declined by over 95%. Not a fabulous record of success.
Then why not shake things up this year with a severed yak head? All you have to do is book a trip to the Himalayas, shoot an arrow through a ferocious yak’s head, decapitate and mount it on your front door. Or you can really get in touch with your inner wild game hunter by sticking your arm right into the yak’s head. Just imagine the look on the faces of the small children when they ring your doorbell on Halloween night and a zombie yak hand puppet pops out at them.

Naturally various time travels movies come to mind when you think about the premise. Everything from Marty McFly venturing to his dad’s high school days in Back to the Future to the indie hit Primer. So what makes this movie different from the others? In my opinion the answer lies in the director, Rian Johnson. One of his earlier films was, Brick, following a teenager diving in the crime ridden underworld of high school, another not so unusual premise right? But they key is the way the story is told. For those that have seen Brick know that what made the film good was that it does not follow the typical structure most stories follow.

Some people might hate the idea of having to go to the doctor three times a week, but again I tend to find this alternative much better than hospital bedrest so you won't hear this girl complain! Plus, Jim usually takes me out to eat afterwards and I am enjoying our little lunch dates more than I can say! :) It feels really good to have some semblance of normalcy back into my life.
Drawing upon her experiences in Jamesport, the largest Old Order Amish community west of the Mississippi, longtime Missourian Naomi King writes of simpler times and a faith-based lifestyle in her new Home at Cedar Creek series. Like her series heroine, Abby Lambright, Naomi considers it her personal mission to be a listener—to heal broken hearts and wounded souls—and to share her hearth and home. Faith and family, farming and frugality are hallmarks of her lifestyle: like Abby, she made her wedding dress and the one her mom wore, too! She’s a deacon, a dedicated church musician and choir member, and when she’s not writing, she loves to travel, try new recipes, crochet, and sew. Naomi now lives in Minnesota with her husband and their border collie, Ramona.
Hearing of Paul’s Roman citizenship was a great surprise to all who stood by. It prompted the centurion to disobey his orders from the chief captain which was a dangerous thing to do. It came as a bombshell to Lysius as well and he immediately went to Paul. “Tell me, art thou a Roman?”
Land owner Rusty Roodt told The Witness newspaper he would approach the high court in Pietermaritzburg on Monday to obtain a court order to stop people from invading his land.

I don’t think we got cable until 1981 (when I was 7) or so… Back when A&E and Nick were the same channel, there were 5 movie channels (everyone knows about HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, and even The Movie Channel, but few people remember the Home Theatre Network), and HBO wasn’t descrambled but was set at the tap for your house. (Meaning I could get it in my room via a cable split without a cable box, unlike the descrambled channels.)

I layered a couple of different types of paper including some vintage piano rolls. I airbrushed using my Copic airbrush attachment and some Coffee Break stencils--I use the large X-holes and the numeric stencils. It's amazing how much depth you can get with just two stencils and switching off between different colors. I used a couple of different yellows along with the teals. While the yellow is not as prominent, it does give the teal some variation.
This week is not a wonderful one.

But after all that, I was still mad and didn't even know why. I should be happy. It was great, I learned a lot, and I was very glad to be home. But I was mad, resentful, mean even!
Yoga puts me at a peace in my life, that I know others lack. After a yoga session my body feels alive and at one with the world. I know I could do anything the day has to offer. And I don’t complain about the many things I have to do in life like other people do. I just simply go down the list and just make sure lots of fun things are thrown in the mix!
Not much else to say about today, because of the weather and my late start, I went much quicker than I normally do, which worked out well, I missed getting rained on.

As I continued on through college, I gathered a new collection of dresses. Diva dresses. My voice teacher taught me that it was important to dress the part of the performance as well as sing the part. Those dresses were all purchased with my dear friend, Mark, and sometimes others joined us on our shopping expeditions. (I still have them all and will occasionally pull them out, put one on, and sing an aria or two with an art song thrown in for good measure.) Each dress had a specific song or performance. The maroon velvet will forever be the "Vivaldi dress". The beaded black sleeveless will always be the "Mozart dress". You get the idea.
Me will be happy when it is all over and me gets to go home!!!!!

christmas afternoon was spent at church and I was extremely proud we made it on time. but the christmas program was beautiful and it was a nice way to remind our children of the reason for the season.
Mike an I chatted about the previous life of Park Delicatessen and he knew of the woman that had owned the earlier shop and then he did me one better dropping the name of the German owner who opened the store originally and sold the place to her. Mike learned the history in part from the landlord. So that covered my need for historical awareness and for community outreach how bout a free skate event? My lateness in posting meant I missed getting this out before the Park Delicatessen Skate Park event they held in the school yard of ol' PS 316 across the street. They built ramps invited kids and were grindin' all day (pics on their blog) As mentioned he hopes to hold Skate events monthly through the summer.
This next card was the continuation of my brief love affair with Popcorn (don't worry, it's not over - he will be back) and is a stamped and coloured Popcorn done in a tunnel card - again he's coloured with my speccies, the paper on the outside is from the matching Popcorn Kids CD, but the paper inside the tunnel is again from that freebie pad from a recent magazine. I've also used a sentiment from the CD and I've used some Dew Drops for accents.

When we picked Dylan up, the teacher handed me the UNEATEN COOKIE CAKE! Apparently there was smoke in the school, and no one could figure out where the smoke was coming from. The fire trucks came and the day was generally chaotic, and they weren't able to serve the cookie cake. Can you believe that?! (Oh, the call was from them, to tell the parents about the smoke).

And ultimately, I wonder about the fascinating stories of those around me, and how little I actually know about my friends. Basically finished a book I am co-authoring with a friend about his life story, and when we started the project, I thought I understood the trajectory of his life and basic plot; I didn’t have a clue.

I named her "Lucy," because the condition that lightened her feathers is called "leucism." It's not the same as being an albino. There's pigment there, it's just not as much as usual. I think Lucy's case is interesting because the color pattern is different from a normal junco. Junco's are top vs. bottom colored, not front vs. back, like Lucy.

Some may object to me calling hold up men "the enemy". You can call them whatever you like. I can assure you however they are as deadly an enemy as you will find anywhere but the battlefield. Even many soldiers probably lack the viciousness and utter disregard for life most hold up men possess.
When you feel tired and worn out from life and the many battles you go through. Remember Isaiah 40:31. Read it out loud. Post it on your mirror, your refrigerator, or even put it in your cell phone. When you get tired and feel as if you can not go on, read the verse out loud. Ask the Lord to give you fresh strength to continue on. He will! Then my brothers and sister in Christ, SOAR LIKE AN EAGLE!!!!!!!

I've been lazy as an old slug lately. I'm sure the rainy, grey weather has something to do with it. I've got to figure out someway to get some of my energy back. But really, 55°F in mid-July just isn't fair!!! Because of this stupid rain, running has been difficult and unpleasant. I'm going to have to get used to running in the rain if I want to have an activity this winter.

Whilst it would have been good to see this sooner, the TUC did however do us the service of giving some figures for the amount by which public service pensioners will be worse off as a result of Osborne's statistical sleight of hand in shifting from the RPI (Retail Prices Index) to the CPI (Consumer Prices Index) as the basis for future uprating of pensions in payment.
I’d seen the first Twilight film, so I knew what I was letting myself in for: a high-school melodrama, distinguishable from other high-school melodramas for it’s lack of humour, and a few vampires. But I preferred the second film, primarily because Edward, the dyspeptic vampire love interest was ‘off-stage’ for most of the movie. In his blessedly few appearances, he looked less like a star-crossed lover than an emergency patient in urgent need of Imodium.

Inside, the hut is like entering the family living room with photos covering every wall and simple but welcoming decor making you feel instantly at home. We had the downstairs dining room with view of the kitchen meaning we got to see first hand Franz in action. There is also a small upstairs room and a private dining area in a smaller hut outside guaranteeing a truly intimate experience in the middle of the mountain wilderness.
Here in Japan, we have seen a few brewers produce cans. Yona Yona was on the shelves in cans when I got here in 2007, and they are definitely among the leaders. I have recently seen Coedo and Echigo beers in cans even out here in Inaka Mie. It would be great to see more Japanese brewers follow suit, especially the other mainstays leading the field already in quality and availability.

The child was gold embossed at the same time, so that I could mask her amongst the flowers, when I had finished using the wild honey DI I masked her again to add deeper colours around her for effect.
However, among my various reservations about this film, everyone is treated as a full-blown PERSON. No one is one-dimensional. No one is just a problem or an obstacle or a story device or a cheap laugh. Even the children and teens. Even side characters with one line (e.g., teenage kid who expresses his heartfelt compassion for Matt at a gathering). Tremendous human dignity here.
While we were waiting for the crew, Curtis and our oldest son ventured over to the cattle yard to check out the damage . Many (MANY), beautiful old trees were snapped off or uprooted. The chicken coop did a somersault and landed on its roof. Curtis reported that the black hen was dead under the rubble, but all of the other animals were fine. The dog house (it is actually a cat house, but people look at me funny when I say that) was gone. The small food dish next to it was undisturbed.

Diet cola- deadly combination of caffeine and aspartame. The combo actually creates a buzz in your brain cell- right before the brain cell dies. Aspartame causes formaldehyde build up in the brain, can causes headaches and migraines, cognitive problems, and can even lead to cancer.

Today, what I see in South Africa is not whites killing blacks, but the other way around. The truth is that the generation that was indoctrinated with hatred were the blacks who were told to hate whites by the lying communists. This hatred is still evident in South African society and is reported daily in Beeld and the rest of the SA media where we read about blacks raping, torturing, high jacking and killing whites every day...the exact thing the SADF wanted to prevent.
While magic can be used for both light and dark castings, like a sword it is in and of itself neither good nor evil. Boil the bark of a willow tree, and you have an ancient form of aspirin. Magic? According to modern religion, yes. Well, up until a few years ago the Catholic Church refused to believe that the earth isn't the center of the universe. I wonder how long it's going to take them to admit that women aren't supposed to be subservient to men? There are some religions in this world that will probably never understand that one.

2nd best? Eek. My choices are LBJ, Nixon, Ford, GHB, Clinton. Sadly, I have to say that it’s a toss-up between Clinton & Nixon, with both having serious flaws. You might see a glimpse of why I have a bit more faith in Obama.
1. My absolute distaste for the girl in the office who manipulates the men with her inappropriate clothes (when is a strapless sun dress and inconvenient heels ever appropriate in a casual/kind of business casual environment?) and giggly, stupid girl shit. I'd love to know the story of why one of sales guys was fired. Corporate "investigators" were called in for that one and I know for a fact she is somehow involved. It's an office mystery that is probably just going to make me sick to my stomach. I really don't want to know.
And anyway, you know it all already.
This adds to my long lists of reservations about the BWA. Does the Booker board throw writs at bloggers who criticise its shortlists?
2012 will be a good year, despite all the doom and gloom spread by media and politicians. Provided we are ready to take advantage of our future by being proactive. If you have a small business: Don’t sit and wait for the phone to ring. Go out there, find new clients, and if all of this is not working, perhaps you have to redefine your products or find new angles to the ones you’ve got. If you are employed and don’t like what you are doing: Get further training in areas you are interested in, have a chat with your employer, find a hobby that offsets the dreary job. Anything, as long as it moves you forward. If you can’t find a job, don’t sit in front of the PC all day, feeling sorry for yourself. Don’t waste your time, talking yourself into more darkness. There are lots of charities out there, looking for volunteers. And you never know – volunteering somewhere might open up new job opportunities. It certainly will broaden your horizon.
The Associated Press reported Saturday that people lingered at the scene of the traffic-stop shooting. About 20 bystanders taunted the police.
Who Can Kill a Child? doesn't begin right off with its story. Instead, the first ten minutes presents images of dead or dying children in concentration camps and war zones. A voiceover tells us that in war and in disasters caused by humans, children are the greatest victims. Millions and millions of children have died because of adult actions.
My husband's family are the most unselfish people I have ever known. When I was really low this Christmas I had no energy to make any Christmas preparations at all. My wonderful mother in law bought me some flowers and made me homemade chocolates and gave them to me in a beautiful hexagonal jar. I have never deserved them less then I did this Christmas.

However, a double murder which took place this week will be somewhat more difficult to hide, as the victims were a little more high profile. Leon and Hetta Steyn were a well known couple who ran a popular and award winning restaurant and guest house near Sabie, a small country town nestled in the majestic Drakensberg escarpment mountains of the Mpumalanga province. Their Restaurant, The Artist's café, is located in a refurbished abandoned railway station dating back to the 1920's and appears in many of the top tourist guides to South Africa

The neat thing about terrariums is that you are only limited by your imagination. Add large rocks to represent craggy mountains or small mirrors for ponds. You can even create a desert landscape with succulents and cacti. Or make a mini landscape with pathways and furniture! So try your luck at indoor gardening this month! It will make every day feel like spring.

Things have been going well here this week. Everyone is well (knock on wood - quickly!) and Sweet Pea has gone to school every day. She shared one of her books about space (meaning, she took it in and one of the teachers read it to the kids at circle time) and has brought home two cool papers to show me; one showing certain numbers of beads which she had to count. She wrote the correct numbers in the rectangles above the pictures of the beads. This paper showed 11-19 beads and she did darn well writing the numbers, which is very cool. 12 came out as 21 but other than that the numbers were in the correct places. Today she showed me a writing practice sheet she completed for 1-10. She just had to write each number over and over on the line next to the printed number. We've been working on writing her numbers at home because whenever I send mail to anyone (or whenever she does, for that matter), she REALLY wants to write the address. That is not possible yet for her - it would take 3 envelopes and a magician of a postal worker to read it, since she cannot control the size of her letters and tends to just put them anywhere if she runs out of room while writing, which could mean that if she starts writing a word at the bottom right of a page, half of it will end up backward at the top left of the page. I have, however, been having her practice writing zip codes on scratch paper and then allowing her to write those on envelopes once she's got the number shapes down. And I think that's why she chose to do that particular work today at school.
“By choosing to work with Hella Jongerius, KLM is opting to engage a top Dutch designer to help make our Business Class passengers feel at home on board,” said Erik Varwijk, managing director-KLM. “As a designer, Hella has broad experience which she can apply to the needs of KLM and its customers, in accordance with the specific requirements for cabin interiors in the airline industry. Her previous projects demonstrate her ability to process such criteria into top-quality designs such as the ‘polder sofa,” which is both comfortable and beautiful. With her expertise and focus on quality, she is keenly aware of what makes a brand unique. An outstanding match!”
I’m feeling good about my summer push challenge, I know it’s only a few days in, but I’m sort of giddy about it. Like, nervous and excited at the same time. Almost like I’m not sure what I’m getting into, but I have a feeling it’s going to be an interesting adventure. Over the past few years, my life is just totally different & I haven’t really processed this change in myself till lately. How I spend my time, my priorities – everything has changed and sometimes I have these moments, like yesterday when I realize I have ALREADY changed during this process and it makes me so proud of myself.

Acetaminophen is not one of NSAIDs, such as aspirin. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen has no effective anti-inflammatory activity. Also, it does not cause gastrointestinal bleeding as a side effect and can be taken without food without irritating the stomach (which is why Tylenol is often preferred than Aspirin).
And those three conversations were not unusual in the slightest. Move over Dance Moms, the Gym Moms could make you hide under your chairs and cry. Can you still cry if you've had massive amounts of Botox? I'll have to do some research on that one.
The part of this article that really hit me in the face was when she mentioned the message that our children are receiving when they are ignored in this manner is that they are not important. "I am not important." How heartbreakingly sad! I have felt this way in my past. I have felt that heartbreak. And I thought I was trying my hardest so that my son would never feel that way. I never want him to feel that! I want him to know how special he is & that there is nothing in the world more important to me than he is. I tried to justify what I was doing because I was "only checking it for a second"! But we have to remember that our actions speak louder than our words. I can hug & kiss him all I want. I can tell him how much I love him as much as I want. But if I don't play with him because I am playing Draw Me on my phone or if I ignore him as he brings me a book because I am too busy looking at a message on Facebook, what message does that send. "I am not important."

This short length unfortunately works against the series because some plot points are established and then thrown out as early as the next episode and other characters that could otherwise be interesting are reduced to side spectacles. If the series was a 26 episode long anime, or even just 20 episodes the plot could have probably fit better together and these characters could have been given a bit more depth. Still to be able to get character development out of 7 characters in only 13 episodes is pretty impressive, but the extra length might have worked to the shows benefit and fleshed out the plot.
But what about the sinner? Not every sinner repents and Jesus threatens that one with punishment. But if he repents, Jesus will not cast him out and according to Matthew 18:15, we have gained a brother. It is of profit to each of you when I repent of my sin. How? Because then we are viewed as acceptable before God.
It left me thinking though, is it time to start talking to him about Life and Death? Touchwood, we haven’t had a death in the close family but life is cruel and you don’t know what it presents you the next minute do you? This was a play, how do you explain stuff like this to kids? I remember my grandma telling me that people become stars and go to the sky when they die, Its such a beautiful idea isn’t it? I know its not true but since my granny died I still like to believe that she is up there as a star looking over me and I can still raise my head and look at her, may be a smile will be passed between us a twinkle

He’s also an alien, so how can we be so sure all his parts are in the same place? The bulge in his underpants might be another hand for all we know and his sex organs are on his calf.

I started this blog before Claire was born to keep our family and friends updated about her CDH. It was a great tool to have while we were up at the NICU because it kept me from having to make so many phone calls and allowed everyone to see pictures. Since then it has become an "online baby book" (I love going back and reading my old posts and remembering all of Claire's major milestones), has kept our out-of-state family in the loop, has raised awareness about the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect, and has provided hope and information to expectant CDH parents who stumbled across it via search engines.

His body was laid out upon the cross where He was attached to the tree upon which He would die by nails driven through His hands and feet. The cross was then picked up and stabbed into the earth where Jesus hung in extreme agony until He said ”It is finished”, and He then died. He was wounded, beaten, bruised and endured great sorrow for you and I that we might have salvation by the blood that He shed upon that tree, and that salvation we would have it freely.

I’ve learned so much in this assignment, such as new computer skills, tweeting, and just think this will be my first blog post! I’ve also learned how to apply and prepare for writing grants for the financial programs. I’ve gained confidence in my ability to network with people that support Manatee Reads! and VISTA’s common interests. I reached out to CredAbility and spoke to them about helping us present a workshop on budgeting. By exposing our needs and their services, when an opportunity arose, CredAbility immediately thought of us. Through my reaching out to them, they were able to partner with us to provide workshops to our students free of charge.
At the end of the church service, when the Sanctuary is mostly empty, I walk up to Anna while she’s still playing. Again, to preserve her anonymity, I film only her hands on the keys, as done on the instructional DVDs and youtube videos I’ve watched. We speak briefly, and I mention that I recorded parts of two congregational songs earlier and she gives me a look of horror. I tell her that I didn’t film her – that the camera was aimed at the pew only and she is speechless, looks even more horrified, and leaves quickly.
I have to admit I was fairly stumped for a reply to this lament. I gave my head a good scratch in the hope of stimulating a few brain cells and then tried to extract myself from the role of counsellor. “I can see you’re very upset about this,” I conceded, “but why in the world would you come to me for advice? How could a gorilla possibly know what a human should do in such a situation?”
Grayson didn’t answer right away. He was still thinking, scheming. Madeline’s letter was inconsequential. However, the other held potential ruin.

We like Tex-Mex. But honestly, tortillas and refried beans and all the fixin's are expensive. So, I reasoned out to myself that there had to be a cheaper alternative. I have a crockpot. I can make beans, right? So, with a goal in mind, I set out on a research trip in front of my trusty search engine and came up with several recipes that looked tasty enough, and easy. I thought this was hard stuff! Boy, was I wrong. Now, it does take some time, but very little of it is hands on.
All the recipes I have found call themselves "whole wheat", but then I am disappointed to see that they use mostly an all-purpose or bread flour with just a small amount of whole wheat flour. Admittedly, I grew up on 100% whole wheat bread, so I am used to the taste and texture and much prefer it, but if you find you need to ease yourself or your family into it, by all means substitute all purpose flour for some of the whole wheat flour. Give this a chance as is though--my husband raved about how light and moist these are and what a nice texture they have, he said the weren't at all heavy or grainy like he thought they would be! I also didn't want to use milk, butter, shortening or sugar, and while I did use an egg, I am playing around with substitutes (such as milled flaxseed mixed with water, a common egg substitute these days). You could also substitute all or some of the water for milk--water happens to be super easy, and since we limit our milk intake, I don't always have it on hand. Sugar can be substituted for the honey, but if it's not already, you need honey in your life. ;)
And I like to think that in any situation I'll calm down, no matter what fingers are raised, no matter what words are spoken.

The same is true of love. Jesus makes this explicit in verses 12-14 where he ties love to death to friendship to his disciples. Thus, even though Moser is making quite another point, the principle is nonetheless the same: To love one another merely because we are commanded is rather meaningless. Our love for one another must be tied directly to the cross of Christ. We are not automatons: There is logic behind the manner of love that we demonstrate for one another, to our enemies, and to our neighbors. It is the Cross. In other words, there is such a thing as an ‘orthodox’ love that we are to demonstrate.

I wanted to write this out, because I want to show that it is difficult staying positive and on track. I have a ton of support, and I’m pretty positive about the direction my life and goals are headed in right now…but that doesn’t mean things don’t get in the way. Negativity is just out there, and sometimes it finds the people who want to avoid it most. I’m making progress, and I’m working hard…but the stress can get to me.

The collaboration between MIT and Harvard is in some sense natural, since they are neighbors† in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They hope that other institutions will join the initiative and provide their own educational materials. The software for the edX platform will be released as open source, so that other institutions can host their own sites if they wish, and will be able to contribute to the development of the platform. For students, there is an obvious benefit to being able to access courses from many different places with a single set of tools. A single platform will also improve the value of edX as a tool to learn about learning.

It is with this background in mind that one has to view the large currency this exclusive claim has gained with time. The pantheon of values that is the legacy of the European Enlightenment has long dominated the minds of certain sections of our society. Scientific rationality is the holiest of these values. This domination inevitably has victims.One such victim is the communitarian consciousness of the past, that is passed on and amended from generation to generation.Recollections of the past, fables and grand-mother’s tales, jati-puranas, gathas and legands, carry within them the imprint of long time-range mechanisms of survival, of healing from trauma, of long-held aspirations and fears, of close encounters.This is being replaced by an immutable archival view of the past. We have come to know this as history - objective, sharp and if one may add, unethical, pitiless and enslaving. It is frozen, out there – it simply needs to be unearthed , excavated, deciphered, dusted off and archived.Irrespective of whether it is a story of progress or not, it closes the possibilities of the past, nonetheless. The needs of present people cannot open it up as they wish, but only as History allows.

She scooted close to my side, looking up at me like I was sharing directions to some kind of hidden treasure. I washed my hands, wiping off the remaining suds on a towel and turned to pick her up and hold her in my arms. She rested her head on the side of my neck, quiet, waiting for me to continue. I carried her to the living room and sat on our seen-way-better-days couch. I rested my chin on her head as the cushions sank further down into the frame.

In September 2010, Ars Technica published an extensive article examining the fall–and rise!– of the sequel, containing news that Duke Nukem Forever is officially on, and people lined up to play a version of it at the Penny Arcade Expo last year. That was a good sign that the Duke truly managed to defy death by development hell.
We also got Sweet Pea Leapfrog's replacement for the Leapdesk (her great aunt & uncle got her one a couple years ago for Christmas and she loved it but it fizzled out recently and since they don't make it anymore I don't think we can get it fixed & they've stopped making the books for it). The new product is called the Tag Reading System (which was out for trial at BlogHer in July but I couldn't get near it, it was so popular with the moms!) and it has a talking pen to which you can download up to 5 books at a time. The books are softback and hardback story books, but with the pen they are much more than a storybook because they contain games you can play with the pen, the kid can use the pen to read one word at a time, one sentence at a time, one page at a time, or the whole book (with a little sound to let you know when to turn the page). The games include questions that teach reading comprehension, and some questions send the child back into the story to find characters or other things. It is really amazing how detailed this teaching tool is. I thought the same thing about the Leapdesk. I guess this is why Leapfrog is in business: They're good at what they do!

Brewing is a funny industry. Sometimes it settles in obvious places, such as large population centres, like London or Edinburgh. Others it pops up in seemingly random small towns such as Burton, Alton, Newark-on-Trent and, where we'll be today, Alloa. Water is usually cited as the reason for these strange sitings. And it certainly played a part in the case of all the examples I've quoted. All had the gypsum-rich water demanded for Pale Ale brewing.

This beer pours a dark amber color with slight ruby accents and a small tan head on it that quickly dissipated into nothing and left no lacing. The smell is dominant of dark fruits (plums and raisins) and caramel malt. I consider this a "malty" nose, and I like it on this cool fall evening. The flavor profile hits heavy with all of the caramel malt in the nose coming full force on the palate with other flavors or dark fruit, banana, and a spot of sweet molasses, but the alcohol in this offering also comes through in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation and a good shot of warming alcohol is present. The drinkability is very good on this beer, and I could have easily drank another one.

As soon as I wake up, I hear the ocean. I can't see it from my condo but I can hear it calling out to me. The sound awakens me and helps me feel alive. Watching the sun make its way into the sky, hovering over red tiled roofs and a plethora of palm trees, energizes me so that I can start my day fresh. Today is a new day and anything is possible. Maybe I will write more today or maybe I will practice yoga both in the morning and in the evening or maybe I will go on a photo shoot. The possibilities are endless. All I really know is that I wouldn't have seen the bright orangish yellow sky that one discovers first thing in the morning if I didn't have to take Floyd out for a morning walk. I'm so thankful for moments like these. They are simple and so very precious. In these kind of moments, I really connect with God's love and grace.
