So, looking at this we can tell that for boys the most common popularity range was 11-50, and for girls it was beyond the top 1000. Of course there are 11 more boys than girls, as well this is a very small sampling, so the results are fairly skewed. However, beyond the popularity, I just wanted to mention some notable names found on the list:
So if you're looking for a good run and good beer in the South Bay, looks like Strike Brewing is the place to be Wednesday.
The reason Mayawati has been repeatedly voted into power in the otherwise “backward” state of Uttar Pradesh is because its big dalit populace wanted to have somebody of their “own” who would listen to their voice and “do something” for them ultimately, which they so otherwise deserved as humans. To put it simplistically: Mayawati is the manifestation of dalits’ desire to have their share in the state’s polity. But what the dalits of U.P. have got back in the bargain is for everybody to see.

I co-teach a 3 year old class at our church's weekday program. As we teach our classroom full of curious little minds, I've been amazed at the impact it's had on me. I was planning the lesson for February and included the verse about love from 1 Corinthians 13:4-8:

With much discussion online about the future of legal education and the question of which way to turn – mentoring schemes at university level seem like a possibility for both small and large firm to meet potential future employees and give students a taster of the job and a potential foot in the door.
I am extremely concerned about the future demands on an already stretched social security system which will inevitably be required to pay for fundamental mistakes taking place in early years education right now today.
I wasn’t really sure if I was going to attempt to go after the ironman status this month. Well I am not directly going after it, but I will hit it at my current rate of play. The problem is that I don’t really have a limit as to the number of games that I play in a day, so I use that 50 FTP mark as my starting point. I usually stay around there. I can tell you that I feel like I’m rangebound this week. I got up to $156 yesterday, and then at my lowest today I was down to $126. I was on the worst sort of Tilt too, I kept having to breath deeply, and then I’d catch a worse hand. I had finally had it, and was playing HU, and I raised a hand with K7 off, and he re-raised me. At this point I was pissed so I pushed. He called and flipped A10, I caught a boat on the board, and that guy was pissed, but it ended my tilt. I said sorry to the guy, but he wasn’t too happy.

As the years passed, the troll needed some outlet for its nasty confrontational ways, so it bought a laptop at a box store and found the internet - thanks to an air card and affordable broadband plan. So then, the troll, like all other trolls, was able to spend the day on the internet doing pretty much what it did in the past, except without the threat of bodily injury and really unpleasant appearance.

When we ask questions, we expect answers most of the time. That’s just how the world is. But I think each of us has these little questions deep within ourselves that never seem to be answered. There just doesn’t even seem to be an answer. And this is when some of us become troubled and confused, doubtful and even angry.

Even more worrisome is the fragility of the success in stopping both bills. Several council members continue to be all too willing to wipe their feet on everyone’s civil liberties for the sake of ‘sending a message,’ enforcing ‘community standards’ as they see them, and/or for the sake of safety advantages they concede to be small. And others may be ready to revisit the debate and approve these measures the next time some headline grabbing incident takes place.

The new Play Store app also improves the way you can sort reviews. It lets you sort reviews by either the most helpful or the most recent. It also lets you apply a filter so you see only the reviews for the latest version of an app, or only the reviews done by people with the same phone (or tablet) as you are using. Given that apps can behave quite differently between updates, or across the different hardware and software combinations used in the Android ecosystem, we find this to be a welcome set of improvements to the app discovery process.

As I swiftly made notes and on the specific points and references from Scripture, I found myself agreeing verbally with the thoughts as they were written.

Erin's never had a professional swim lesson in her life. Anyone who knows Erin, knows that she had a horrible time with water for the first 5-6 years of life. Well, my girl shocked me for sure. When we went to Texas a few years ago for our travel group reunion, Erin wanted to go into the pool so badly that she begged me. After Amy gave her a few impromptu lessons, I allowed her in the pool. It was a big step for us.
The parts about the lesson that I like are that the students used authentic cultural resources, and practiced targeted vocabulary and grammar. The part of the lesson that I am critical about is I cannot be sure what the students got out of it. Their efforts led to writing sentences on a paper that I looked over and posted in the classroom. How do I know they really learned anything? How could I have taken this activity further to make it more meaningful than writing a few sentences on a paper? Could it be a smaller part of a larger project? Could I change the finished product somehow? It just doesn’s sit well with me that the end of the activity is handing in a worksheet that no one will really do anything with. Reader comments and suggestions on this matter would be greatly appreciated!
Imagine the difference it would make in a very short time - why, we could be using the back porch for cold storage in no time, and the fur industry would be back to a booming trade! Oh, wait...maybe not so much on the fur, because wouldn't that sort of negate the whole effort to be nice to the planet and future generations by nixing man-made global warming effects? So the Thinsulate industry will take off again. Thinsulates aren't endangered and are cruelty free, aren't they?

I didn't get many photos of the main course as we were plating like fools. Food was flying out the door at about one plate ever second or so. Whew! It was a bit crazy. The main course was a Veal Tenderloin Sous Vide with Mesquite Smoked Syrup, Paprika Oil, and Fingerling Potato Puree served with Fall Creek Vineyards Tempranillo, Salt Lick Vineyards, Texas Hill Country, 2009. The veal was amazingly tender and the potatoes were so buttery that you'd think Paul Deen was in the house.
In a large 8-10 quart pot, dump your semi-defrosted frozen pears and basically you let them simmer down into a boil and you let them simmer on the stove for 6-10 hours until the pears have turned into a very thick sauce. You can add your spices after a few hours of cooking down and taste test to see if you want to add a touch more. Start smaller so that you don't over do it though.

It could be financial, health, loss. With life it’s a given that there are going to be valleys. The question is not will I have to battle discouragement, it’s when.

The plan for this expedit was for each boy to have 1 basket each for their shoes and 1 basket to hold their hats.

I find that it is working really well and the kids now get their own shoes and the older 2 will also put them away. My youngest just likes to pull all of his shoes out. He has a thing for shoes...he also loves pulling out my shoes in our walk in robe.

Coke has used the ZERO marks since 2004, but that alone is not necessarily enough to demonstrate acquired distinctiveness. However, Coke has enjoyed substantial success with its ZERO beverages.

Advertising expenditures were more that $150 million from 2004-2007, and for the entire ZERO line they rose to more than $500 million by 2010.

If you have never attended an Easter Vigil candlelight mass, please consider doing so. The symbolic, sacramental nature can be truly powerful. Maybe because I am a visual person, it is a moment for me to truly see how powerful Christ’s presence on earth was in the form of light vs. darkness. Maybe because I critically think through everything in my life, how God is intertwined in the choices make and I often wonder how real He is in my journey.

After we introduced ourselves to Carol and Gail, we started discussing other ways Cat’s Cradle could promote themselves via social media. The shelter already has a Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/CatsCradleShelter) with 1,381 likes, thanks to Gail, who dedicates her time at the shelter, feeding, caring, deworming, and then goes home to do social media promotion. Gail said she would be interested in branching out to Twitter, but she doesn’t have time to use, or learn how to use, the social media site. That’s where we said we could step in.

Banner should be a conflicted hero, as should most of Marvel’s characters. But Marvel’s writers seem to interpret ”conflicted” as “massive, irredeemable douchebag.” This was after all, was the company that in their Civil War arc decided that heroism meant that Tony Stark should become a fascist dictator of the Marvel Universe, imprisoning people in an unstable dimension without due process or access to lawyers. Read Civil War again, Marvel advocates fascism as heroism, while Captain America who fights for fundamental American values is made to look like the asshole, especially in the Frontline tie-ins.

Our Venezuelan team mate won the day in our group by landing 1km from goal (go Emilio!) and the day's flying was soon forgotten as the party got going and the raffle started. Ozone had donated tons of prizes including the most coveted...a crispy new paraglider. I was so close - they pulled my name right after they gave the wing to someone else! I happily ran to the front anyway to accept my prize from the mayor who was having fun pulling names from the hat. In proper French tradition kisses were dispensed along with a "C'est bon!" from his honour when I remembered the right amount of cheek turns (3 kisses if you're in Provence, FYI). I proudly walked out with my cozy fleece beach blanket, which joined my other prize of an Ozone wallet. Chrissi & I had both won prizes for our walk down the mountain on Thursday and got a hilarious speech from Jockey about being abandoned orphans on the mountain.

This rather unflattering shot is to remind you of the riddle that I asked last Saturday concerning the purpose of a metal template used while grooming horses during Napoleonic times. If you click on the photo to enlarge it, you'll see the checkerboard pattern on the horses' haunches that created an optical illusion to mislead enemy scouts. Evidently, horses that are tired, sick or old have sunken croups, the indented area between the two haunches, so this dappled effect made it difficult for opposing forces to determine the condition of Napoleon's cavalry when viewed from afar.

Yeah, yeah, sure we've seen reference to Albany Ale being stronger in bottles (10.87%) than in barrels (7.38%) and yes there is something to be said for the weakest of 19th-century beer being on the stronger side of what is available today. But a nearly four percentage difference in ABV? That can't possibly be right. No, no—Albany Ale had to be on the lower end of the scale. There has to be an error in the evidence—a misplaced decimal point, misguided 19th-century science, even faulty brewing mumbo jumbo translation. I will fight this tooth and nail—two beers that are just over 7% and one just under 11% can't possibly be the same beer!

Again, the problem is the liberalism, not some unique form of Jewish evil as taansie clearly implies. At this stage it would be quixotic to expel Jewish liberals from the country when there are far greater numbers of non-Jewish liberals. The solution is to emancipate both Jews and non-Jews from their liberalism. And, as Larry Auster and I have both written, this is not going to happen until the consequences of liberalism are so plainly disastrous that further evasion of the truth is impossible. Hence worse is indeed better. But we’re still a long way from that tipping point.

The catch is, Burton didn't lasso his own iguana in Night of, he released someone else's, and this one was really going to be eaten by humans, not just dogs. Gable releases the horses after essentially killing himself doing some crazy ass stunts where he's dragged by a bucking wild stallion. Along with fellow cowboy Montgomery Clift Gable ropes the mustangs for a dog food conglomerate. His buddy Eli Wallach is a bitter WW2 pilot who barnstorms the mustangs out of the mountains and chases them right into the lassos of Gable and Clift. It's a pretty dirty job and the last horses left are a cute family of a stallion, two mares and a colt, and Marilyn's along for the ride and she has a nervous breakdown thinking about these poor gorgeous wild and free beasts being captured and sold for dog food so Gable and company can buy booze. A whole reel goes by while the cowpokes tussle over who will release the horses and win MM's favor, or if they just won't and get the money and buy booze and forget about her.

That, indeed, was a source of constant remonstrance between servant and master. “It does seem a pity, sir,” he would say, “not to hang them”; and to the reply, “No wall space, Dawson, no wall space; wait until we move into a larger house,” would answer with a shake of the head, that implied that in his opinion such a removal was as remote as it was improbable.

Wilson’s first C.I.A. assignment, in the 50′s, was to infiltrate the Seafarers International Union, in which he was eventually appointed to a number of official positions. He also was involved in Congressional lobbying on behalf of the union and apparently began then forming his close relationship with a number of influential members of Congress. Wilson became a C.I.A. specialist on maritime issues and was involved in the procurement of equipment for clandestine Navy operations.

I suppose I could explain how they came about, but that might spoil the fun. After all, a good title should stand on its own, shouldn't it?
Initially, the rest of the album didn't interest me much, but it's grown on me immensely on subsequent listens. Low-key throughout - there's Rafi's wonderfully soulful 'Pyar Hai Ik Nishan Qadmon Ka', Asha's sweet and poppy 'Dil Sajan Jalta Hai' (with a neat ska-tinged break in the middle), the melancholy sounding 'Lalla Lalla Lori Doodh Ki Katori' and 'Suhani Chandni Raten', and finally the fun and playful 'Main Jo Chale Pee Kar'. And did I mention the instrumental?
If you ever get a chance to take one of Fred's classes, I can promise an experience you won't soon forget. Check out the Fred Mullet website. Below are scans of what I produced in class and a few photos from Pam's phone. Would you believe I forgot my camera!!
I was just wondering if my readers enjoy my posts announcing the winners and showing when the winners are confirmed....
I get emails for custom work all the time. I would say, that on a weekly basis, I get at least 8-10 emails requesting specific themes. I love hearing from everyone and truthfully, I am honored that there are so many of you who love my designs, style of scrap booking and work so much that you would love to make it apart of their memory albums. The part I find frustrating and sometimes hurtful, is that when I reply to these emails and give pricing, one of three things happens: 1) I never hear back from the person 2) I get an email back arguing price and saying they won't pay it unless I drop the price 3) A sweet apology that they can't do it right now (this would be the rarest of the emails, however, it is the most appreciated!)
With nearly 2000 blogs participating, I knew I would never get around to everyone, I did hit about 470 though! (roughly 20 a day) Can you say VARIETY?! Holy Mayonnaise - I saw blogs about blogging, kids, pets, comics, food, swearing, Gods, you name it.

And it’s not only at the base of the pyramid, or on its left side. To read George W. Bush’s (or John McCain’s) paeans to the Hispanization of the United States, his homilies to Hispanic family values, his speeches on the merits of immigration amnesty and the related home downpayment amnesty, is to experience nausea. It’s not coincidental that Bush is himself a committed Christian, and his Big Government Proposition-Nation ideology was poured into templates prepared by equally deluded Christian hands like Michael Gerson.
This basket took some time to prepare--thus the time needed to start Tea Tuesdays again. Each of these bags (the boxes and tins were fine as is) are kept in their own ziplock storage bags normally. To undo each of these--and keep them all in order to be properly restored . . . well, that takes effort. But look at the pretty display. Mind you, these are only the teas kept in my "everyday" cupboard. I have a whole host of others for back-up--like well over a kilo (in total) of my various favorites so I never, ever run out (until my next restocking).

The year we arrived in London was the winter of A Proper Pea-Souper: the Terrible London Smog of 1952 (go to this link for excellent photos and details; at the end of it you will find an amusing little video clip of the British Government's 1947 advice as to how to deal with air pollution). The 1952 smog was a major environmental disaster in which an estimated 12,000 people died, primarily from pneumonia, bronchitis, tuberculosis and heart failure. While most of the deaths were among the elderly, unknown thousands were made ill with respiratory complaints and suffered long-term respiratory effects. These included inflammation of the lungs, permanent lung damage and, among children, increased susceptibility to infection.
So, who's next? Um, how about Sean Young? Or Richard Grieco? Oh oh oh! Gary Busey! He can already unhinge his jaw, so yeah, he's definitely a vampire.
What the typical woman does desire is a natural diamond ring. Perhaps it’s because “diamonds are forever?” Diamonds may well be forever, but De Beers only introduced that very successful marketing slogan in 1947. Before then, the gems of choice for an engagement ring were opals, rubies and sapphires.

As I drove away from the clinic, my 'average boy' in the back seat, I pondered that. I began to wonder about his future as a child...will he always be average? Will he think of himself as mediocre, second rate, undistinguished, unexceptional? Dear Lord, I hope not. I remember school...all the kids that are almost-prodigies get all the attention, all the awards, all the blue ribbons, all the trophies. The expressive ones that sing well make the leads in all the plays. The best basketball players will make the team. The class clowns get all the laughs. The smart ones get the A's and their names on the honour roll.

FIRST REPORTS IN ON PHILLIPS V. AWG CORP.: The Federal Circuit Bar Association just completed a meeting with counsel for Phillips, AWG, and the USPTO immediately after their arguments at the Federal Circuit. The arguments were heavily attended at the Federal Circuit(250+ people), and it was standing-room-only. While nobody was ready to make any hard-and-fast predictions, there were a few interesting observations that were made about the oral proceedings:
Tonight i decided on a whim to have a go at making soap. Ive never really thought too much about making soap as for some reason i didn't think soap was overly popular these days but anyhow i wanted to play and make something girly.
He always seemed to know when someone was sick, or sad, or lonely, and he would try to keep them company. Whenever one of the girls stayed home sick from school, he would lie in bed with them all day long. When Jill was dying, he spent almost every day curled up by her side. When Katie was grieving and adjusting to her new home here, Schrodinger was in her bed every night, curled up with his nose right next to hers. It comforted her to have a furry companion, and I think he knew that somehow. I think he could sense that she was sad, and that his presence made a difference.
Three, and without this I wouldn’t have proceeded in spite of my second reason, I returned to the first book and found that I still loved Brendan and his family (time away from them allowed me to see this!). There were also some loose threads I had unintentionally left myself that hinted at there being more to the story.

With Austen, a happily-ever-after cannot be guaranteed. Her stories, though focused on love and relationships, are not category romances... which makes it even more delicious. Austen realized, two hundred something years ago, that a happily-ever-after is not what is important, it is the love story between the hero and heroine that make the story worthwhile.
The sentiment is from My Craft Spots Butterfly Kisses. The Twine the a mix of Divine Twine and The Twinery Twine.

For my niece Megan's room my sister-in-law picked this adorable Twinkle Little Star Baby Bedding by Kimberly Grant. This set is great it really goes with their home, they have brown and tan throughout the rest of the home so it really ties in well. The bedding is also great because it is gender neutral. When they have another baby later on they can reuse it.

The Gingerbread House is a sweet, intense story about finding real love against the odds. Greta and Gray make a beautiful, fun couple who not only understand each other, but enjoy each other as well. The author’s easy style helps the story flow, carrying you along with it as it develops. A wonderfully emotional journey that has a very happy and a bit surprising end.

It's intensely lively, the first sip fills your mouth with carbonation and CO2, amongst lots of Belgian/peppery yeast - so you don't really get an initial impression of flavour. Give it time to warm and a bit of a swirl to kick some of the gas out, and it reveals a really interesting and complex beer. Soft and floral. Really fruity. It reminds me quite a bit of the Pretty Things Jack D'or Saison. A soft, slightly sweet caramel malty-ness is matched with a drying, peppery Belgian quality which makes it very moorish. Some bitter orange, vanilla, honeycomb and a little citrus peel are in and around the body and the finish is long a drying.

NASA, JPL, CERN and the Los Alamos National Laboratory all give explanations for their switch from traditional space theory to a more generally accepted (and more familiar electromagnetically-driven) plasma physics, whose founding father, Swedish Nobel laureate Hannes Alfvén (1908-1995) coined the phrase ‘Plasma Universe’. Originally trained as an electrical power engineer, he researched and taught many years in the field. His plasma theories describe behavior of aurorae, Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts, effect of magnetic storms on Earth’s magnetic field, magnetic and electric fields in cosmic plasmas, the terrestrial magnetosphere and dynamics of plasmas within our galaxy.

Coming up in June is Health 3’s MSC – mid-service conference. It marks one year at site. Technically, we won’t hit the year-mark at site until July, but Peace Corps will be busy with PST for Health 4. Two other PCVs and myself are currently planning MSC. We’ll be responsible for synthesizing the opinions of our entire group and identifying sessions that will hopefully be useful. Our MSC will be in Kibuye again, and I’m looking forward to seeing everyone and also being fed snacks twice a day.

I didn't come in here very ill. The crohn's was broadly fine (well as "fine" as it ever is...) but I'd been getting chest infections for months. My local hospital didn't want to know because all my notes and specialists were here in Cambridge, 130 miles away from home. It became clearer and clearer that I needed a whole MOT of tests and investigations, so the only way was for me to have them done as an in-patient up here.
On the other hand, Android 4.0, codenamed Ice Cream Sandwich, is running on just 2.9% of Android devices 6 months after its release. This is partly because the makers of the phones control when the OS is released for their phones and, as that linked article shows, some makers have been slow to release it to their users.
It was a good day to be in front of my kiln yesterday that's for sure. Even my studio helper Mr. Boo sat right in front of the kiln door for a long time. You know it's cold out when he does that.
He quotes or refers to so many disparate authors in the course of his writing, from Henry James to E.B. White. On top of that, John Donatich speaks of Myron Floren and k. d. lang in the same hysterical paragraph as he confesses to his love/hate relationship with the accordian. Ya gotta love it!

Full battle erupted in July with a Japanese attack into Mongolia. The Japanese, with an army of some 80,000 men and a regiment of tanks, struck in a clever encirclement against the Soviet-Mongolian forces. Unfortunately for them, the force was commanded by General Greorgy Zhukov (later Marshal of the Soviet Union and conquerer of Berlin). Zhukov sensed the encirclement, counter maneuvered and drove the Japanese out, killing five thousand and destroying the armoured regiment.

Christ Jesus, the Son of the living God, by His death abolished the sting of death that we in turn might all experience eternal life. It is given freely to all who ask and believe upon His name. He paid our sins in full. His blood abolished death. His being nailed to the cross is the ultimate sacrifice and has bought us eternal and everlasting righteousness in the eyes of God. Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Savior.

This is a beginning of series of posts that will discuss the unintended consequences of occurrences in our world. Most of these occurrences are very commonplace and as a result are very accepted. Even worse than being common, many of these occurrences at first glance appear to be good not only economically but morally. My intent (wink wink) is to cause be to rethink and analyze our world.
The face of our drawers should sit just a little bit behind the door frame trim when it is fully closed. In order to get the support board for the drawer slide the proper distance from the door frame trim, we clamped a 1x2 and used it as the spacer. Once the support board is screwed into the wall, we'll remove the clamp and the extra 1x2. We also decided that the top of the top drawer wouldn't come higher than 48" so that I wouldn't have any problems seeing inside them (I'm not super short but maybe a little). Because the support boards sit at the bottom of the drawer slides, we also had to make sure they were at the correct height so that when the drawer was in place, it wouldn't come higher than 48".

As a matter of fact, those individuals that foot the bills - primarily shoe companies - often have influence over who the athlete selects as their coach. Or at the least make strong suggestions. Which actually makes the coach the employee of the shoe company and not of the athlete - and in many cases the coaches are on the payroll of the shoe companies. Leaving the shoe company in the lead position over both the coach and the athlete.

No doubt you can understand my eagerness to learn the details of these two topics. So I was stunned to learn, upon arrival, that a strict No Work Talk rule had been established prior to my arrival. There was to be no discussion of our primary teaching profession or our secondary jobs. The policy, which had been proposed by Pippin, had strict consequences: anyone caught talking about work was to be immediately slapped by the person sitting to his or her left.

But the climate for print publishing is pretty dire currently. The loss of the bookshop chain Borders just before Christmas has not helped to improve the picture. Many people, including Ann Jungman and the Maven, opposed the purchase of Ottakar's by Waterstone's in 2006, believing it would lead to a monopoly on the High Street. And this has come to pass.

If we let government take away our freedom, then fear wins.

As cinematic hero, Jefferson Smith-the honorary 'stooge' elected to congress for the sheer purpose of filling a seat while crooked politicians carry on illegal activities- Jimmy Stewart proved himself to be a strong acting force in Hollywood. The performance is absolutely brilliant, legendary, full of heart...unforgettable. We laugh and cry in turn as we see Smith go from bumbling, naive citizen to pathetically determined patriot. Even for those who have no political affiliations, like myself, there is no denying the impact his perseverance can create. Though Robert Donat won a well deserved oscar that year for his role in Goodbye Mr Chips, this performance of Stewart's remains my all time favorite male performance on film. For the female audience, there is also a moving love story that develops between Jean Arthur's feminine lead and our title character. Again, Capra's direction exceeds expectation and is topped off by a brilliant script and flawless supporting cast.
I feel good about the way things are going.
Forget that high dollar Orvis crap. A shirt called the “Trout Bum” that costs $98? Are they nuts? Are YOU nuts? Forget that crap.

The fifth Marquess of Salisbury, grandson of the great Conservative Prime Minister and descendent of Lord Burleigh adviser to Queen Elizabeth1, wrote to Viscount Swinton in 1954, in a letter preserved at the Public Records Office, ”We are faced with a problem which, …With each year that passes, and with the general improvement with methods of transportation, the flow increases. Indeed, if something is not done to check it now, I should not be at all surprised if the problem became quite unmanageable in twenty or thirty years time. We might well be faced with very much the same type of appalling issue that is now causing such great difficulties for the United States. The main cause of this sudden inflow of blacks is of course the Welfare State. So long as the antiquated rule obtains that any British subject can come into this country without any limitation at all, these people will pour in to take advantage of our social services and other amenities and we shall have no protection at all.” That Queen Elizabeth I had “Blackamoors” expelled from her realm in 1601 shows what a Conservative value it is.The Daily Telegraph of 4/10/07 reported, “Foreign criminals are moving out of big cities and infiltrating rural towns and villages. The gangs include Jamaican "Yardies" selling crack in Hereford and Cambridgeshire, Chinese criminals called "Snakeheads" in Lancashire and Norfolk, Albanians running prostitution rings in Hampshire and Colombian cocaine networks in Chelmsford, Essex.A television series, “ Crime Invasion — Britain's New Underworld”, for the Virgin 1 satellite channel, was presented by Rageh Omaar, a journalist who has worked for the BBC. Omaar said: "Crime in the UK is changing and making the series has shown me that it is happening right underneath our noses." The chief constable of Cambridgeshire, Julie Spence, has said that immigrant workers were importing their national feuds and criminal behaviour to rural England.”Democracy is a myth. Few people bother to vote. It attracts inadequate and ignoble people to office because it involves bribing and deceiving people into voting for them; it attracts hypocrites who preach family values and commit adultery or who preach equality but send their own children to public schools. As few voters read the parties manifestoes they have no mandate. The main issues are general movements that political parties conform to, not attached to a political party. In our time it is multi-racialism and all three follow it. Culture is treated as independent of people and anyone can come and adopt it like putting on and taking off clothes. Aristocracy is a form of rule that suggests permanence and continuity as they embody the nation and its traditions. A warrior class based on the land, their duty was to defend the nation was well as rule it. The House of Lords must be re-created as the new chamber will be for rewarding members of the political elite and to stack decisions in the elites favour. Only the gullible think this will be democratic. It is part of the ongoing takeover of our lives by moneyed elites whose loyalty is to themselves and whose vision is the dissolution of our nation for unworkable Globalist aims. They are using people for cheap labour - both outsourced and imported. Re-creating the Lords will be a step back to aristocratic and monarchical rule. Rights were demands of the capitalists that led the French Revolution. Our main historical references are the American and French revolutions and the nationalist revolutions of 1848. It began the destruction of the natural order of sceptre and crown for rule of the Liberal-Capitalist class where membership was not by blood but money. They wanted the disestablishment of religion, the dissolution of nationhood, the denial of race as a social factor, and finally World Government or Utopia. The media elites manipulate the masses into supporting these ideas. The main issues of the day are movements that political parties conform to: they are not attached to particular parties and the major movement of our time is multi-racialism and all three parties conform to it.Traditional prejudice conveys wisdom to new generations but Liberals and cultural Marxists think they have transcended prejudice yet beneath their high-mindedness is the prejudice that immigrants are essentially good but whites are essentially bad and they take sides with immigrants a priori - the rationalisation comes after: “They are going to become English”, “they are bringing diversity”; “Islam the religion of peace”, “they are enriching our culture”, “the hospitals could not run without them”, “we need their doctors”. This justifies them asset stripping the third world of workers and doctors. It is motivated not by guilt but shame: if you feel guilty you are remorseful and seek to make amends which our elites do not do but direct immigrants into our communities so we are used to make amends for them. They live in lovely areas or safely in gated communities while ordinary people get mugged, burgled and raped, and put at risk of Aids and T.B. They do not spoil their own areas but use worthy causes like Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England to preserve them. When centres for asylum seekers are proposed for the countryside, the elites are in uproar to keep them out. Political, intellectual and corporate elites are selfish and think only of themselves. The one gets cheap labour, the others pose as moral beacons to the un-enlightened. They loathe their own people and do not care how much we suffer as long as they feel virtuous. Many illegals work unlawfully long hours for almost nothing and have their liberty restricted by their masters and classic hypocrisy is the elites apologising for historic slavery while importing wage slaves! This is opposite of the Conservative virtue Noblesse Oblige: the obligations of the noble to the lower orders who reciprocate by loyalty and service. Modern Noblesse Oblige would be adopting economic protectionism. This value was preserved in opponents of immigration including working-class Socialists as the British are naturally Conservative.

A highly successful jockey, Dessie Hughes (born October 10, 1943) partnered Davy Lad to win the 1977 Cheltenham Gold Cup and returned to Prestbury Park three years later to ride Monksfield to victory in the Champion Hurdle. He had four rides in the Grand National, including Davy Lad, but never managed to complete the course. Having always had one eye on the future, Dessie prepared his yard for three years before finally taking out a training licence in 1980 and the winners soon started flowing, including a first Cheltenham Festival victory as a trainer when Miller Hall took the 1982 Supreme Novices’ Hurdle. His yard was struck down by a persistent fungal problem in the late 1980s which resulted in Hughes enduring several years of poor form, but the trainer began churning out the winners again in the late 1990s, with horses such as Guest Performance, Rathbawn Prince and Grade One winner Colonel Braxton being standard bearers. But it would be Hardy Eustace who would provide Hughes with some of his finest hours as a trainer. Owned by long-standing patron Lar Byrne, the Archway gelding won the Grade One Ballymore Properties Novices’ Hurdle at the 2003 Cheltenham Festival before returning a year later take the Champion Hurdle under a superbly judged ride from Conor O’Dwyer. Hardy Eustace went on to victory at the Punchestown Festival and returned to Prestbury Park the following year for another victory in the Champion Hurdle, becoming the first horse since Istabraq to successfully defend his crown. Central House was another outstanding performer for Hughes, winning five Grade Two contests as well as a Grade One Novices’ Chase at Leopardstown. Schindlers Hunt emerged as another star, winning two Grade One events as a novice chaser and finishing the head runner-up in the Grade One John Smith’s Melling Chase at Aintree in
The reality is we are nowhere being able to formulate any trend on ebooks, other than what is cursory.

Speaking of riding, despite the lack of words on the topic I’m doing plenty. Interestingly with the change in lifestyle much more of my riding is “utility” riding. My Nomad is getting more use than my regular road bikes thanks to it’s ability to carry stuff. This is no bad thing, I fitted a new Brooks saddle and it needs some serious breaking in before the next adventure.

Hailing from Rome, exploring droned out electro pop territories with an interest for a refreshing hyperactive 80s New Wave, Newclear Waves’ soundscapes seem to surround a fruitful visual-graphical imaginary which deals with mass consumption, apocalyptic visions, weird machineries, post-modernism and the order of chaos.
OK so here is what you do once you get home. Get out the gloves that the nice man at the seafood counter gave you. Put those on and start dicing and chopping and cutting that salmon up into a FINE MINCE- this means really, really small. Set that aside. Get out your handy dandy skillet and heat up like a tablespoon of coconut oil over medium. Beat the eggs for a second on low before beating in the flower, the minced jalapeno, white pepper, and salt. Beat this all together for about 20 or 30 seconds- not too long and not too high. Just get it mixed up nicely. Then you add that salmon in there- with your hands- and combine completely.Go ahead and throw some olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and toss your onion, squash and zucchini in there with some black pepper and olive oil (yes, more EVOO is always good). Let that cook and kinda toss it around every few seconds for a minute.
Remember when Bush and Cheney, those nasty oil guys, were responsible for high gas prices, now with Obama in the WH it is those nasty speculators. This real issue in both cases is the lack of a comprehensive national energy plan. We cannot get there until we know there is!

There are rules which must be followed if you wish to turn out a decent product. Far too often wanna-be writers confuse rules of construction with the stifling of creativity. It isn’t so. The purpose of writing on whatever kind of machine – quill pen to manual portable to the internet – is to convey thoughts and ideas, and for that there has to be a common, mutually acceptable ground between writer and reader. Creativity is wasted if the reader has no idea of what the writer is talking about or if the storyline is a chaotic, mis-spelled mishmash.
So the key for me is planning ahead. I know what I need to do to get back on track. Hopefully by the end of this week I can lose the 1.2 pounds I gained last week and continue to do so into next week.

persuasive reading of the poem is as an assertion of the individual, female voice – “the breaking down of identity and individual experience in favour of the life of the city that threatens to destroy the ‘I’” – attempting to find itself within the conflicting onrush of modern Paris (both Classical and demotic, filled with symbols of Religion and Art but also the ‘dreck’ of the contemporary) and ultimately – paradoxically - discovering that “Paris liberates the speaker from individual life and experience...The self returns to its private, secret tongue.” (Julia Briggs’ Notes at the end of this

Finally I asked to speak to her manager and was transferred to a much more reasonable-sounding person. He sounded quite surprised when I told him some of the things Ms DC had said to me. He said he understood my frustration and that he believed me that Optus had cancelled the debt, but that it would remain in their system until Optus contacted them to inform of this. (I'm still wondering how Ms DC had that information to give me last week if it wasn't in their system. No explanation was ever offered for that.) Both this manager and I were confident that the Optus case manager would sort that out in the near future. Which left the question - why did someone ring me this afternoon, just to put me on to Ms DC for a twenty-minute lecture on the ways I could supply this proof that I apparently had to provide to the agency? Hmm. No answer to that either.
According to Kahneman, “The two sources of information can be combined by Bayes’s rule. The correct answer is 41%.

SNOBSWAP is a site that works a little like Ebay. Members can put designer clothes, shoes, purses and other accessories up for sale on the site. What's cool about SNOBSWAP is that you're allowed to trade or "swap" items between members! You can also switch up the method by which you pay for an item - for example, if I like your Chanel 2.55 and you like my Chanel 2.55 (but yours is in a little better condition than mine) we can swap Chanel's and you can also charge me an extra, say, $250. :) In addition to swapping, you can also list items and accept regular cash for them.

Anyway, after seventeen years of hell, being insulted for not being ‘girly’ enough, wishing every day that my physical gender would change, trying to block it all out, I cracked. I’d been considering it a hell of a long time and I finally decided to admit it to myself aloud. I wanted a sex change. I still do and I regret all of those years of denial because maybe the path would’ve been shorter by now but everyone makes mistakes so hey ho.

In sum, self-verification theory says that individuals want to be seen in ways consistent with their self-views, be they positive or negative in valence. This motivation has strong implications for the ways vulnerable individuals react and respond to social feedback. Knowledge of self-verification motives can be used to more successfully interact with others, and to design effective interventions for improving the way we react to the positive in life.

Toyota's argument assumes that Paice is only entitled to the same reasonable royalty rate the jury calculated for past damages. That amount is what the jury found a willing licensor and willing licensee would have agreed upon in a hypothetical negotiation from the time infringement began to trial . . . It cannot, and should not, be used for calculating a future royalty rate in a prospective compulsory license. This standard fails to take into account the potential for future lost profits, loss of potential value in granting an exclusive license, and the ongoing willful infringement that would occur by Toyota. Though an injunction has not been entered, Toyota's decision to commit ongoing willful infringement of a valid United States patent, because it is so essential to the success of its product, should be considered in setting a royalty rate. A district court may find that it should not permanently enjoin an adjudged infringer from selling infringing goods. However, the infringer should still have to account for its choice to continue willfully infringing if it chooses to do so.

You can also say its sour grapes because my husband didn't even wish me on V day. The fact that we are not really in talking terms worked for both of us because he doesn't believe in birthdays, V days and anniversaries and I believe in them too much that I am annoyed if I'm not made to feel special on all these days. But strangely enough he remembers the day we met, the day we got engaged etc. etc. which I think is cute, but who cares about dates...show some love instead (or a Tiffany's ring would make me a happy (but shallow) woman)

This isn’t just blogosphere monopoly conspiracy bollosks. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. gave evidence on September 2nd to the European Union that a combined Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext would “drive competing platforms out of the market.” They would give that sort of evidence, of course – and they are already the second- largest U.S. equity exchange operator, by the by. Oh, and they, um, did try to buy NYSE’s securities business earlier this year. And during 2006-7, they showed their deep commitment to open and free competition in the good ol’ ‘merican way by trying to buy the LSE. They failed….but sold the 28% shareholding they’d built up to the Dubai bourse. Ah.
One of the biggest deciding factors that made me solidified my decision with studying abroad came when a good friend of mine said this quote to me one day: “In College, you have the time, but no money. When you have a career, you have the money, but no time and money is always something you can gain back, but time- you can’t get that back”. Right then and there my friends was my biggest motivator. I decided to study abroad for the simple reason that I want to see this world and as much of it as I can in my lifetime. The experience of studying abroad outweighed my doubts about finances and time. I strongly believe that life is too short to be wasted not being able to see and experience this world for its diverse cultures, people, and natural beauty. There’s just so much to see and experience and I can’t wait to get started!
God is consistent in his requirements of us. He calls us to turn away from wrong and sin and to embrace his loving grace through Christ Jesus. All we are to do is be faithful to what is right and true and God will shower us with blessings of peace. Again in 1 Peter 5:6-10! We are told again and again throughout the Bible that in order to experience grace, we MUST humble ourselves. We must admit our fault “…that he may lift you up in due time.” (1 Peter 5:6)

Some people, of course, hear about this and laugh. They think it is very funny that people are so stupid as to think things like that. But the phenomena which are occurring are quite real. The descriptions which people give of them have a remarkable similarity to what we Orthodox Christians know in the ancient Lives of Saints – especially the descriptions of phenomena given by people who claim to be abducted by UFO spacecrafts and so forth. Whatever you might think about these stories, what they describe is exactly what we have heard described in Lives of Saints as to how demons operate, i.e. their remarkable ability to switch from matter to psyche, to instantly vanish or appear, or to move very quickly from one place to the other. This is the way the demons operate, and this is the way these so-called space beings operate also. It is very interesting that demons come back into modern history through this means.

. . . There is no statutory requirement for an applicant to file relevant prior art in Canada, although the Canadian Patent Office may request information relating to the prosecution of corresponding applications, including cited prior art. In any event, we recommend that the applicant always voluntarily disclose the prior art information at the outset since the examiner routinely will request it, it simplifies examination and prosecution, and, most importantly, should the resulting patent be subject to a validity challenge based on prior art, Canadian courts generally will refuse to consider any prior art which has already been considered by the examiner during prosecution.

I'm beginning to feel as pissed off as I did when I blogged before. Not necessarily about things like the "cuts" the coalition are making, because I genuinely believe it is needed. In fact the cuts are not enough, and real dead wood in the public sector should be more vigorously pruned. Most of my ire now is directed towards the EU, and I want to say more about that among other things over coming days and weeks.

Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.

So I, like most of us, got an email from Microsoft in the last week or so telling me that I’d attained a new certification by doing absolutely nothing. I’ve been an MCSE since 1998 on Windows NT, then Windows 2000, then Windows 2003. When they came out with the MCITP certification back in 2009/2010, I was a little annoyed since all of the products and technologies I like to show expertise on now each required their own certification. So I got the MCITP on EA, SQL and Exchange. It was a lot of tests and some extra tests I wouldn’t have normally taken, except I wanted the cert.

Tip: Making your own cards is a great way to use up some of your older items. For these cards I used some papers from a slab that I bought when I first started scrapbooking way back in the early 2000s (yes, it's time to purge LOL!!). You could also use up your scraps and create a bunch of different cards with the same overall design.
What if we can't escape the squall we're in?
I really love how this card turned out. While making the card I thought to myself that it had been some time since I used the mat pack so I pulled that out to finish off the card. I think that the paper piercing give the card just the right touch, what do you think? The card front is Kiwi Kiss which was then matted with chocolate chip. The stamped layer is very vanilla, a color I always forget to use but thought it would look much better with the other colors I used on this card. The stamp set, Watercolor Trio, is in the current mini so it won't be around much longer, very sad in my opinion as this is such a beautiful stamp set. The sentiment is from the set Fifth Avenue Floral. My punched flowers were cut and pulled on to give them some dimension and then I added pearl halves and smooch paint to make them sparkle. The smooch paint was also added to the butterflies for more sparkle! You all know how much I like my sparkle, lol! Chocolate taffeta ribbon was used to finish off my card along with the punched edge.

Also, Dirty Mind debuts the sexually-oriented lyrics the world has known him for. On this album, the lyrics takes one to a porn movie. First, the title song talks about a woman making him horny. Every time he’s around her, he gets a “Dirty Mind”. When we get to the third song, Prince wants to “Do It All Night”. Song number five, he goes “Uptown” and gets laid by a woman who asks is he gay. On “Head”, he gains oral sex from a woman who’s on her way to be wed. Then on the song “Sister“, like a scene from the Taboo porn series, he’s a teen-ager being seduced by his 32 year old sister. Yet, again, the song could be a protest against sexual abuse. After all the sex, Prince goes into political mode attacking the military with the song “Party Up”.

Once last time the maiden is placed in a room, this time vast, with towering bales. As she wallows there, alone in her despair, the little man returns. This time she has nothing to offer him. He asks for her firstborn and the maiden agrees – thoughts of children are far from her mind. All turns out well, then, for a while. The delighted king offers his hand in marriage (the girl is of low birth but she is attractive, and she has made him rich beyond imagining). It is only later, long after the wedding festivities have concluded, that the young queen gives birth to her first child. And the little man returns to claim what is his.

Businesses that produce goods are more likely to introduce new production or businesses processes as well as new or significantly improved products. This is a result of considerable research and development that takes place. According to the research, while manufacturing makes up only about 11% of GDP, it is responsible for the overwhelming majority of domestic research and development spending by companies. It is this research and development that is a critical component of innovation.

My words and images can’t possibly do justice to the experience and so all I would say is, if you ever get the experience to visit a game park that does early morning walks, do it. There is nothing so awesome, nothing that quite puts you so in touch with wild nature as actually walking in it, being part of it, respecting the magnificence. And scared?

Most waffle recipes work in any kind of waffle maker, but I get the sense that this one is intended for use on a standard (not Belgian) waffle maker.

My friend, Dr. Alma Bond, was a psychoanalyst for 37 years. While she still has a limited practice, based on the Freudian theories, she has in more recent years devoted herself to writing books that are quite distinctive and which demonstrate her powerful imagination. Her latest will no doubt fascinate fans of the late Jacqueline “Jackie” Kennedy who became an icon of the 1960s when her husband Jack was President until his assassination. The public could not get enough of her. She was beautiful, intelligent, the mother of two, married into the already famed Kennedy clan.. The assassination changed much. She married the Greek shipping magnate, Aristotle Onassis and when that marriage failed, her companion became a stout, adoring Wall Streeter, Maurice Templeton. She took a position as a book editor and, at the age of 63, non-Hodgkins lymphoma took her life. Throughout her life she protected her privacy, but now Dr. Bond has written a unique “autobiography” for her, Jackie O On the Couch, ($21.99, Bancroft Press) that she never wrote herself, bringing the events and personalities in her life to the reader in her voice. This is an audacious literary project, based on fact, but a work of fiction and Dr. Bond pulls it off. Anyone who lived through those years and was a fan of Jackie will greatly enjoy this book.

He had decided that he would not say anything which could make Iqra feel guilty. She has already been through enough and so he would not burden her with his thoughts. Yes, he loved her. But he would let her go if she wanted to go back to Shahzeb. He would not convince or pressurize her to stay with him. Because that seemed pointless. If Iqra was really in love with Arham, she would never leave him. His gut feeling had gone totally numb since morning. He tried hard to hear what the silence in his head was conveying but it was of no help. He was restless, impatient, scared, flustered and many more things as such. But he just HAD to hide all of that in front of her.

In 2008 she started writing her blog L's List and a few years later started a second blog titled Instead of Pajamas. It was fun learning about the thought process behind Lauren's style and how being a working actress has effected the way she looks at fashion.

We leaned over the side to watch the next to last boat being lowered. It was terrible. Apparently, for some seconds, there was no one above directing the lowering of the bow and stern falls so that she might be held level. The bow was lowered so fast that the people were almost dumped out into the water. I think, if Long and I, and others, had not yelled up — “Hold the bow,” they all would have been spilled out. Finally, in a few minutes, she reached the water safely.

He plucked the rock from his pocket, reached forward, and tapped at the stone blockade. It clicked with each tap, but then it slipped from his hands. He picked it up and reached forward to knock again, but this time there was no sound. Instead, his arm went into an open space, a colder space. He put the rock in his pocket and reached out to feel an edge. There was now a hole where stone had been a moment ago. He felt around the edge and detected what was a wall of stone left, right, and up. When he felt down it was dirt, like the space he was lying in but softer and wetter. He crawled forward, out of the tunnel, and stood up.

I keep telling Jimmy that I want to be a gypsy. I want to wear long skirts and braid my hair and ride around in a horse drawn wagon playing on my guitar. Obviously that’s an extreme version, but its slowly more and more apparent that the more I get, the less I want. I can never turn down travel for work, a photoshoot, a hosting job, a blog article, a business meeting, a social appointment, for fear that I may miss something crucial further down the track. And so, it piles up, convincing me further that I like it this way (when maybe I don’t).

It may be helpful to have a go at designing the basic layout yourself with a software package such as 3D architect - prices start from around £250 for the basic package. Failing that, pencil and paper will do the trick, if you have a good spatial awareness. If you do that, though, remember to give some of the smaller rooms in particular the benefit of the doubt. For example, that downstairs study you’re planning might also make a useful guest room. If you gave it an extra foot here and there, would it be big enough to fit in a single or sofabed? Equally, don’t forget to over-calculate how much storage space you’ll need to build-in – the temptation with new-builds is to go very open-plan, very minimalist, and often storage space is the one thing that gets overlooked.

As one who has participated in peaceful prayer vigils outside Planned Parenthood clinics, I've experienced the feeling of helplessness as women are ushered into the clinics by volunteers who do their best to shield women from hearing the voices of pro-lifers offering support and help. Too often, the peaceful pro-lifers' voices are drowned out by the radical vocal minority who wave large signs depicting aborted fetuses or shout, "Murderer!" to the scared and confused women seeking help at the abortion clinic. I've seen the workers zip in and out from behind the tall iron fencing, avoiding all eye-contact with the prayer warriors. I've wondered what good could we possibly be doing standing there outside the abortion clinic, praying to our unseen God, while women in crisis are inside being stripped of the life within their wombs. How can our quiet prayers be heard when other voices shout words of damnation to the patients and staff on the other side of the fence? I've wondered what sort of monsters those people must be who work and volunteer at such a place of horror.

From where I sit, this interpretation explains Kuranosuke much better than any narrative that casts him as mis-assigned daughter of a tragic actress. His boyishness adds extra comedy to all his attempts to “teach” Tsukimi and her friends how to act like women and use their “natural weapons” (tragic and uncomfortable, yes, but also a satiric look at privilege on many levels). His misguided understandings and behaviors serve much better if we dismiss the possibility that he’s attempting to express anything more than a love for fashion.

As the rest of us were chatting amicably, she made a great show of reading her book. Of course, the conversation flow was hampered by her location near the doorway, but I felt sure she wouldn't have joined in anyway. She was reading her book but not reading her book if you know what I mean. She may have turned three pages the whole hour and a half we were there. She would examine her hands and fingers and then bite her finger like I'm prone to do when I'm nervous. Every time there was any activity near the door, she would look up anxiously. The only time she seemed to pay any attention to us was when the conversation turned to religion and prayers which Lillian and the Ethereal, Mystical Margaret brought up and the rest of us joined in.
Also, I have very mixed feelings about the wedding. I think one of the reasons I have decided to share my wedding was because it felt like such a disaster. I was (and still am) so disappointed by our venue. Yet the fact our venue let us down (so very much) showed me how much the people around me are so incredibly wonderful. If there were ever a peace time equivalent of the Blitz, it were our wedding. It would have been an unmitigated disaster without the brain and brawn of our family and friends.

In 1 Corinthians, Paul called out some sexual sin that was being tolerated within the church. He told them that someone who claims to be a Christians, but goes on in sin (any sin – not just sexual sin) is not to be tolerated.

His fellow legislators made a lot of noise about expelling him.

So it was back in the closing stages of the previous century. A populist outburst of the “gatvol” phenomenon in 1998/9 compelled the then Commissioner of Police, George Fivaz, to partner with former SAB head Meir Kahn. Fivaz and Kahn configured a bold plan, promising an embattled public medium and long term relief from crime. Restive tax payers bought into it. Nothing ever came of it- with tail between the legs, Kahn & Fivaz quietly disappeared, but the illegals kept coming. In 2000, Jackie Selebi took over from Kahn, and with great fanfare announced a “far-reaching three year plan” to renovate the SAPS from top to bottom. An article from that time reads: “in March 2000, we were treated to a military-style blitz, live on television on inner city Johannesburg. Impressive? No, it is simply more of the same. Policing in SA during the past 5 years is a history of hastily convened fire-fighting campaigns orchestrated by panic-stricken personnel at police HQ in Pretoria”.

After the dough was mixed I had second thoughts. I really, really hate soft chocolate chip cookies. So at the last minute, I decided to try to get some crispy edges by changing the baking technique. First, the dough was “cured” in the fridge for two days. Then I underbaked the cookies slightly at the recommended 375F. After they cooled, I baked them again till lightly browned. The cream cheese, browned butter and sea salt give these cookies an interesting and pleasing set of flavors, and I believe they have slightly more structure than they would have if only baked once, though the edges did not get crispy. Wonder of wonders -- my fussy hubby raved about these cookies, and I enjoyed them, too.

When it’s time for kids to be let go, let ‘em go. She raised us boys to be independent, to take care of ourselves, to clean up our own messes, and to purchase our own stuff. She set us free to live our lives as we felt led to lead them. When it was time to let us go, she let us go.
The Former White Hat Consciousness from the Fifth Desnity recommends listening to the 16-tape Contact Notes on Meier and the Plejarans, which are up on Youtube in 8 three-hour sections. Information within touches base on some things the FWH has been discussing…keep in mind, however, that after 1984, the Plejarans stopped their contact with Meier and the FIGU had been infiltrated by the CIA and MI6, and that Meier was compromised by the Bafath Gizeh people, causing him to go insane.
We managed to negotiate a 30% discount at the Cathedral Peak Hotel and booked the honeymoon suite for two days. Stunning room with stunning views.
The downfall of our ego is the fact that as much as it loves to sabotage with negative thoughts of how “unworthy/ other label” you are, it ALSO LOVES to praise itself for how “AWESOME/ Special/ insert other label” you are. Then it will make comparisons, to other events, people… etc etc. If you had a friend that was as undecided as your ego is about its opinion of you, you would probably deem that friend as MAD and run as far away as you could:))
“Play Joe Budden,” he went. Then, he started naming other current hip-hop acts.
The next day, I skipped school like I normally would on a Monday and spent the entire day cleaning up the mess. From time to time, my roommates would pop in to mock me endlessly, and offer some desultory advice while I was on my hands and knees scrubbing. These ranged from "I knew you were good on your knees," to "You missed a spot." I contemplated murdering all of my roommates while they slept, but changed my mind when they all made me dinner later that night.

Drawing upon the wisdom and experience of Church Fathers, Padre Quadrupani illustrates the difference between involuntarily experiencing temptations and voluntarily committing sin.
To his complete shock, or dismay, and to the amusement of the faculty gathered to observe, all it opened to was a small room with a large statue of Zeus that was firmly rooted to the floor. There was only enough room for a small, slight person, such as a skinny, twig of a girl to move around to statue, maybe to clean… or access a hidden switch.

The Cooling Towers at Richborough looked splendid in the early morning light and a flock of 45 Mute Swans flew out from a pool at the back followed by another 10 that were in the company of 8 Bewick’s Swans. The first three of only 6 Marsh Harriers were seen passing out of the reserve and when one Harrier flushed the Lapwings, a single Black-tailed Godwit took flight with them, this being a new species for the year for me. After a while we popped in to Feast hide for a quick look noting only 5 Tufted Ducks, 2 Pochards and a few more Teal then it was onwards to the Harrison’s Drove Hide. Although looking potentially good for a decent bird to turn up on the only thing there today was a single Redshank. Next stop was the Marsh Hide where amongst the gathering of Lapwings there were 5 Ruff, 7 Dunlin and another Black-tailed Godwit also, at least 16 Snipe were on the edges of the water. The unringed Glossy Ibis flew up and over the hide and dropped into the fields near Newbons Farm, 18+ Water Pipits were scattered around the wet fields in front of the hide and a couple
As the firstborn son of a powerful Scottish laird, Robert MacGregor has no loyalty to the English throne, but he's not the kind of man to leave a woman in distress, even if she is English. He vows to deliver Davina to safety, unharmed and untouched. Yet one stolen kiss leaves them both smoldering with desire...and desperate for more. With Davina's secret threatening to destroy his clan, Rob must choose between everything he holds dear and the one woman he can't live without.

Say what you will. Some things you just have to take on faith alone. This story is one of them. I am not making this up but I have no proof. Well, there was at least one witness to the initial moments of what transpired; but the "ah-ha" was between me a God alone.

If this were just my whiny story about how my childhood sucked, I wouldn't bother telling it. But this sort of thing is done to children - by teachers, and also by parents, the people who are supposed to make a child feel loved unconditionally - every single day. And in those moments, what the caregivers are communicating to children is that their willingness to comply, to obey, to complete a task which serves no relevant purpose in the child's life, is more important than whether the child feels loved, safe, or worthy. It communicates that the child's access to such things as food, drink, exercise, and affection - essential human needs* - are contingent upon the child's performance. When such treatment is given to a circus animal, it is investigated by the ASPCA. When it is given to children, it is called education or discipline. The taskmasters are praised for a job well done, and given cooing sympathy - the kind they refuse to provide to their own small children - from other parents if the child proves difficult to train.

In a nutshell, the nutcase from AK got paid big bucks to spout her ‘we are the daughters of God’ dribble to an infatuated crowd of women at a religious convention over the weekend. I could care less. Well, except that every time she gets paid for spewing this crap some poor young, innocent woman gets sucked into the vortex.

But I digress for this story about Vancouver. Actually there's no big story other than in 1986 the World's Fair was taking place in Vancouver and we conveniently had a few days off. My wife and I and our young daughter spent one day at the fair as did the tour members. It was raining--I guess it rains a lot in Vancouver.
In case someone else has never done it....here is a pictorial of how I did it.

Apparently she also missed the memo where two income families can and do homeschool. I know one homeschool family where the Mom works during the day and Dad works the night shift, so someone is always home with the kids. The family eats breakfast together Mom heads off to work and Dad teaches 3 subjects , fixes lunch and then heads off to bed while the kids do their assignments and enjoy some free time. Mom comes home from work prepares supper and while Dad heads off to work Mom teaches her 3 subjects before the family heads to bed. While this isn't the ideal homeschooling situation it works for them.

I think Ron may be exaggerating things a bit with that last quip. But there’s no doubt that Obama has cribbed pretty heavily from Friedman’s playbook. The prominent Timesman has already been the source of Obama’s hackneyed “Sputnik Moment” reference in January, along with the line “nation building at home” in his post-OBL speech in June, making Thursday’s address to Congress at least the third presidential speech this year that Friedmanesque phrasing has found its way into. And the Times columnist has bragged about hitting the links with the president, when he’s not writing about the duffer in chief for Golf Digest. So I doubt he’s going to sue for plagiarism anytime soon. At least not until he can get the matter adjudicated by a court in Beijing.

I am glad that I added the Hydrogene Peroxide to my emergency kit for the pijjies: today I had a adult pijjie in for breakfast together with the others and I wondered why s/he did not react when I approached.

I love when you call the utilities, it's like the Inquisition just to get to the meat of the conversation. And while I'm on the account, they rarely want to talk to the "missus", so I end up lying and saying "Joseph" when they ask my name. It wears me down and so I just naturally do that now. Joe isn't home during the day to handle such stuff, and what difference is it to them WHO fixes the internet connection?? I'm not stealing top secret government secrets here, pal. I'm just trying to fix the damn computer.
Unfortunately, as time went on, this diagnosis seemed more and more likely. He would suddenly become burning hot, and have unexplained, disturbingly intense crying fits. Nothing could cheer him up or distract him. He was exhausted, but unable to sleep. He spat and choked whenever we tried to give him painkiller, in a desperate attempt to lower his fever. Then, he started shaking all over, and I got properly scared. We called the doctor.

There are things that I love about Shimer College. I love the books that we read. I love the rare discussion in which every student around the table is invested. I love the papers that I wish I could work on for months and turn into tomes because I am so passionate about the material. I love the facilitators who ask challenging questions and tease out the intricacies and the beautiful bits of texts that we might very easily miss if we were reading by ourselves. But there is so much that is missing from the experience as well.
Announcing the upcoming theme to give you artists a head start - For June to July it's all about the GOLDEN AGE OF ARCADE GAMES! Any arcade game published between 1978 and 1986 will be fair game, no box covers are necessary, just have the name of the maker on the game (i.e. Dig-Dug - Namco)

What began as a Valentine craft project turned into a broader crafty art idea. Does that happen to you? You start out with one goal in mind and then once you get into it, the project takes a different direction? Originally, I collected paint chip samples in varying shades of pink and used a Martha Stewart heart punch to cut out a bunch of hearts that I planned on attaching to a single square canvas. Since Valentine's day is all about love, I thought it would be cute to hang some hearts in our kitchen or entryway.

Yet another thing in mind, I was wondering why the way I treated some other people may reflected back to myself in recent time. I get back what I gave. It’s fair enough and I could say and believe there is a rule of game which I called it as you KARMA. Treat others like the way you want to be treated. Do more good deeds in terms of helping people instead of not helping in the sense that you are able to do so. With the thousand of reason you give, one thing you will receive back in future that is people tend to do the same way you do to others. I could make this as my promise, if next time whenever I see beggars who are asking for money I have to take out RM1.00 for donation.
We went to church this morning, which was lovely because it was the flower communion service. We brought cut flowers to share, and then there were these little crepe flowers where everyone was supposed to write down a little wish. Afterwards everyone tied up their paper flowers on a tree made from branches. It was a pretty stunning tree.

The good news you and I can choose to support whichever charity we like really easily every time we shop online. It seems retailers think that charities are doing valuable work too, so much so that they will donate a percentage of what you spend online to the cause of your choice. Isn’t that the most simple way to give to charity and at no cost to yourself? Sounds true good to be true, right. Newsflash – it isn’t!
Posters for Maria Talks are being put up in high school nurse's offices across the state. The website has crashed due to the controversy. One hopes that when it is restored, the segments on abortion will have been purged and replaced with a more realistic, less happy-go-lucky view of the topic, as well as no further reference to bypassing parental consent laws. That the state is sponsoring a site that facilitates secret abortions for underaged girls is disgraceful. If the AIDS Action Committee cannot get Maria Talks to remove the information about judicial end runs around parental rights and cannot separate the money they receive from the state from their funding for the site, the state should pull all funding until they can.

At the heart of this, I wonder why Dr Cruddas in particular was invited by the Las Casas Institute? There are many MPs to invite, so the reason is unlikely to be his membership of the Commons. I hazard that it is his Catholicism and perhaps his affiliation to the Labour Party. But, as I have said above, his distorted understanding of the Catholic Faith is a scandal because he is a public figure. There seems to be an assumption in this country that to be Catholic is to be Labour. This naivete reached a nadir in the fawning displayed by our Church over that most reprehensible couple Tony and Cherie Blair. In Mr Blair’s case, I cannot understand how he could be received into the Church without a public abjuration of his erroneous beliefs and practices - for example, his own voting record on abortion. These were errors he committed before he became a Catholic, but they were in the public sphere, and his reception as a Catholic without any recantation is a continuing scandal.
Finally some noticeable action!

Government intervention is necessary to ensure the production of content forms that the public considers valuable, but which would be under-produced if market forces alone were at play. In 2012, the content forms in need of such intervention remain Australian drama, documentary and children’s programs. However, the situation may change in the future and the regulatory environment should be flexible enough to allow for this.

See, daddy thought he was marrying me off to a nice man of the church. Hypocrites, that’s what all them church folk are. My oldest son was arrested recently. He’s had a hard time dealing with the separation and also with authority. I’ve tried to talk to him, but he thinks he knows everything. My girls keep me up at night too. The oldest ones done start smelling themselves and want to give me word for word. Honey, if I had it to do over again, I wouldn’t even have had kids. She don’t know it now, but later on Hannah will realize she was better off without them; I love them, but they nothing but trouble.

When the weather begins to stay consistently warm here in Alexandria, the condo property management folks turn on the sprinklers in the mornings. About a week ago now I woke up one morning to what sounded like rain, but behold! it was the sprinkler that will live outside my bedroom window for the next few months! Hearing the sprinkler when I open my eyes and stepping out on the patio to smell the wet grass makes me feel like a little girl. It reminds me that summer is on the way, along with the hot days and balmy evenings. It makes me want to run through it (although Beulah will have none of that). I love the way the water sparkles in the morning sunshine and how the grass stays green in that patch at least.
I enjoyed constructing this Food Blog and reminiscing about memories shared with my grandparents. When I told them about this assignment and sent them a link to the page, they were quite thrilled and excited that I would include them in my project.

Suddenly the folding doors were thrown back, and a whole flock of children burst in as if they would overturn the tree completely. Their elders marched in after them, more sedately.

She was the competition’s first female winner, and recently had her contract extended to continue working in the team’s performance department.

The ineffective Ji-sung Park was replaced with Danny Welbeck 12 minutes into the second half in the hope of finding an equaliser, but neither him nor the later additions of Valencia or Young added any real creativity to United’s display. Alex Ferguson’s frustration was illustrated in his touchline spat with Roberto Mancini with around ten minutes remaining, and the two had to be separated as tempers flared. United struggled to exert any real pressure on Joe Hart’s goal, and the match ended without them registering a single shot on target for the first time since a 0-0 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford in 2009. The final whistle was greeted with scenes of jubilation from those associated with the blue side of Manchester, and left City with the prospect of becoming the fifth team to claim the Premiership crown.

These guys are regular me and you(s) who have a passion for baseball played the way it was played in the 1860's and 1870's. They adhere to the day's rules and don't use gloves. One of the rules worth mentioning is if you field a batted ball on one bounce, the batter is out. The pitcher still pitched underhanded back then. One of the greatest tools of the pitcher was being allowed to fake the runner and quick pitch the batter. He was able to slow or fast pitch as he chose as long as it was an underhanded delivery. I can't explain my joy watching these games play themselves out and witnessing the differences with today's game.

You should know your child best, and if your child has struggled in specific areas, it will be paramount that you give your child more help in those areas. One of these that I hear over and over is in the math facts category. If your child does not know his math facts (those appropriate for his grade), he needs a set plan (daily practices) that move him into instant recall. There are websites that provide timed practices where your child can get that necessary practice.
Westfeldt is now so well known as the longtime partner of Mad Men‘s Jon Hamm that people have forgotten that she co-wrote and directed the pretty good film, Kissing Jessica Stein, back in 2001. Say what you will about the old-saw tropes of 1) Westfeldt as the pretty but neurotic woman and 2) the storyline in which straight girls “try out” lesbianism for a while but reassuringly return to men in the end. (Someday we will laugh so hard at the way Hollywood loved this narrative in the 90s.) It was still a pretty good film and I had hope for this 30-yr-old female director/screenwriter.

All the older and larger trees in this group were originally McCurrach bonsai and are quite an age, the rest are Willowbog raw material and are younger trees.

Now it seems like we are coming back around to this at oddsness, but in an entirely new way. I hate the term postfeminist and think it’s used largely to negate the changing reality of feminism, the way we can create and recreate and play with and live this word that is so often divisive and abstract. Postfeminism seems to me to say that feminism is what happened in the (60s/70s/80s), that it’s irrelevant to women’s lives today. But if it’s not, it’s largely used to say that, once again, we used to teach girls they could be President, now we teach them they can be strippers.

However, as I walk through the world with all these babies and gaybies and their young moms and dads highlighted in my visual panorama – I HAVE found some things that maybe I do NOT want to do. I’ve seen some things that have terrified me. I’m afraid that if I inflict them on my own gayby it might scar him or her for all of eternity.

I got the victory because of the Blood of Jesus. I am a new creature in Him because of what He did on Calvary. His blood covers me/us and it is what makes the Fallen One and his minions tremble in fear, because they know that on that day, when Yashua’s blood was shed, it spelled their defeat and certain doom.
What signals do you give to a man when you want him to make the first move?
There is also always a murder or violent death somewhere in all those hundreds of thousands of words. And those are the passages Dickens loved to read aloud at the personal performances which might have shortened his life, so physically exhausting were they. It reminds us of what he said to Dostoevsky; he had a strong sense of the potential for evil in himself, in every one of us, as I do.

different photographers approach the same location. As we live only a few miles away from each other we often find that we are taking photographs of places the other has featured on their blog and we became intrigued by the different approach two people might take to the same set of stones, hills, mills and moors. And so we came up with a game (or an exercise, or a project) to investigate this phonomenon. We would stick a pin in a local map until we came up with a village that neither of us was familiar with and then each of us, independently, would visit the village and put together a small portfolio of photographs. This is not a competition (if you are familiar with Jennyfreckles' work you will know that I could never win such a competition) but a way of assessing how much of what a photographer sees is, in fact, a reflection of themselves. We have decided to publish a selection of our photographs of the West Yorkshire village of Thornton (the place where the pin came to rest) over the next week. I have no idea what images Jenny is going to come up with, but I

We cannot control everything that happens in this world, but we can make the best of what we have been given. Let life run its course, as it is going to, but in the process of doing so, live it to the fullest. Do everything you want, and achieve all that you wish to accomplish. Who knows where fate or life may take us tomorrow, so for today, you might at well enjoy the ride.

That’s the first factor about bullying (probably the most overlooked one) that people don’t want to stand out in a crowd. People look at the different people … differently. They actually notice them. I was the guy with the Mohawk in the class… I was the one with a different opinion. Why? I don’t mind being noticed.
2007 saw Gay solidify his growth from ‘06 with a slightly windy 9.76 (+2.2) early on in New York, 9.79 (+2.5) in Carson and a PR equaling 9.84 at nationals. In contrast we got more injury talk from Powell, and no head to heads until the World Championships in Osaka – though we did see Powell in Beograd (9.97), Oslo (9.93), and Rome (9.90). Again the lack of head to heads turned to the talk of contract negotiations in which the WR holder wanted top billing. When they finally met however, Osaka brought Tyson Gay his first global gold medal with a 9.85 victory in which Powell finished 3rd in 9.96. Two weeks later, however, saw Powell run 9.74 & 9.78 in a heat and final on the same day in Rieti – the 9.74 a new WR. A race without Gay or Osaka silver medalist Derrick Atkins as Zurich tried to negotiate a post Worlds race between Powell and Gay, but Powell declined choosing instead to compete in Rieti. Powell ran again in Brussels (9.84) and Stuttgart (9.83) – both without Osaka conquerors Gay and Atkins – before calling it a season.

I tend to scribble ideas on my wall, along with lesson plans, to-dos, and all number of other things. But they get wiped off before I ever get a chance to realise them, to make room, often enough, for new ideas. I could single out one of the huge number of note books that lurk, dustily, around this room and use it for the job, but I know myself well enough to know I won't use it regularly. My ideas usually resemble fleshless pinkie bones when they first appear, not really worth writing down on paper.

* Commercially, Grokster’s scheme only made sense if it could make money through advertising. The more the software was used, the greater the advertising income was. The software was used the most for top-40 hits, which could only be disseminated through Grokster in an infringing fashion. This though was said to be a weaker factor. As well as intent to bring about infringement, actual direct infringement had to be shown. There was no shortage of evidence that this had taken place.

I always like to finish off a workout with this song. When you’re already feeling strong, you feel like you can conquer the world. It makes me feel like I can say yes to anything.

Firstly I want to say that the body has two basic aspects, one is substance and the other is function. They may refer to Yin and Yang in Chinese medicine. Substance includes all the body cells, tissues and organs as also the substances produced by the body, such as hormones and neurotransmitters etc. Functions include the workings of the organs, both alone and in conjunction with other organs. Up until now I have mainly dealt with disturbances of function and most particularly of the heart. Strokes and cancer, which are the subjects of this and following posts, are disturbances of substance.
The cause was a heart attack, said Wendy Williams, managing director of the Louise Bourgeois Studio.
How did women first get the idea of applying little pieces of black taffeta to their faces? In the beginning, these cut-outs simulated the ramifications of veins on the temples. But what was their origin? Could it be a doctor’s prescription for a certain plaster to calm a headache? The effect produced on the face of a pallid woman might have encouraged her friends to do the same.

That being said he did agree with me that I am in real danger of OHSS, which is my biggest hesitance to go to injectables. He agreed that I would have to go on a very low dosage and be monitored very closely. He also pretty much told us we were crazy for considering IVF this early. I admit, we’ve been entertaining the idea. Mostly because I am so afraid of injectables. I am really afraid of over stimulating and winding up in the hospital again and I am really afraid of high order multiples. Plus this doctor has a really incredible deal for IVF. $20,o00 but you get 4 IVF cycles. And that is 4 FRESH cycles, if you have left over eggs you can do a FET at no additional cost. Plus if you do not have a live baby after those 4 cycles he gives you your money back. Doesn’t even matter if you have a miscarriage, that doesn’t count. Pretty awesome deal if you ask me, so if we ever get to the IVF point we will be using him. But he just said that we’ve hardly tried anything yet and that we need to give some other things a try first.

Why? Because birds, bees and other pollinators are responsible for as much as every third bite we eat — the best part of our diets: fresh fruits and vegetables. According to Pollinator, more than 80 percent of the world’s crops require pollination. But declines in the health and population of pollinators across the world pose what could be a significant threat to biodiversity, global food webs, and our health.

Where someone “Liked” it. This I paid zero mind – after all, the Like function is a bit on the vague side – and went on to read the comments where I saw several people berating the aforementioned user for liking the fact that a child’s life was taken before their second birthday. The thing is, though, as much as I myself abhor anyone approving of the universe sending an infant to an early grave, jumping down the man’s throat for clicking Like, much like the review-bombing I mentioned in my last post, is perhaps a little premature. And ill-advised.

So it all started innocently enough. A post on freecycle came through on Wednesday with an offer of a loft bed with slide. I looked up some images on google and decided that might work for one of The Boys. I picked it up the same day, and left it in the garage (in pieces). For the next two days I had The Boys talk to each other about who would get the new bed. My plan was to have The Youngest take the bed, without the slide, and take his bunk to make a loft over table for The Oldest. If that was not what he wanted, I was going to turn the new bed into a train table for The Oldest in the garage. By Friday they had made their decisions, and on Saturday, after 11 hours of sleep, I began.
As soon touched the NH following the suburb traffic, we discovered a trouble with the vehicle that began to wobbling like a boat on the road after 80kmph or leave accelerate free from high speed. It took lot of our time searching for a service centre and each one we seek gives a different opinion on the problem and one says to our surprise that Scorpios are like this, but this is the first time for us to experience the wobbling in 3 years of using Scorpio.
The other day I walked into our bank to add me as a signer to our business account. I made sure to call in advance and ask their small business representative what I would need to do this. They told me I would need to have one authorized signer present, and two pieces of identification. I asked twice to make sure and both times they re-assured me and said this was all I needed.

I am very tired tonight, but I can’t sleep. I haven’t written anything new for this blog for nearly a month, and that’s way too long. So here are some brief thoughts about three things which have gotten my attention in recent weeks.
I knew about Herford both before and after I discovered Alberto Burri, but what I didn’t know was Herford’s impact on Burri. Apparently it was Burri’s experience as medic in the war as well as his time in the prison camp inspired his life of painting, a career that was open to impressive, deft experimentation using many unconventional materials like acetylene torches, plastic, burlap, wire, dirt, and acrylic caulk. Often paintings by Burri feature elegant divisions of space in black, brown, cream, and gold, but the paintings that really jolt, the paintings that in my opinion really matter are his gnarled, chewed works in red and black, melted plastic drippings, splattered swatches of burlap, and bursts of dirt and pumice. The work in the Art Institute of Chicago is still my favorite, a shock of grisle and splat once owned by the Chicago story teller Studs Terkle.

Josh Russell’s Pretend… proves that one can write a thousand word novel. These thirteen stories, some quick, others controlled bits of sprawls, do what great prose is supposed to do: they pick you up by your shirt collar and plop you down in a barber shop mid shave, or on a dare, rural Georgia. His words will beckon you and their lasting images will haunt the furthest recesses of your head. Get this. Get this now.
On at least one trip in 2004, Altantuya, then Razak Baginda’s lover, accompanied him to France as a translator. He later jilted her, impelling her to come to Kuala Lumpur to demand US$500,000 (RM1.5 million) from him. In a handwritten letter found after her death, she wrote that she was attempting to blackmail him, although she didn’t say why.
When I decided to think of what I do as "strategic" erasing instead of "destructive" it changed my perspective. I've come to the conclusion that if it works for me, then it's okay. No one is here in my studio staring over my shoulder going "tsk tsk". The result is what matters. And if my techniques free me to create something I couldn't create otherwise, then I say, "So what?!?!"
Baby is getting TWO teeth. But, I don't have a picture of those, either. Mainly because whenever I try to get so much as a glimpse of her little teethers, she pinches her lips up tight and shakes her head.
He grew weaker as the rocks hit, the wounds festered and more weather elements came. His presence become a sight, not for sore eyes or any kind of eyes at all. He just was, a force of nature perhaps, as some said or would have said. Those who sensed pain while at a loss for a fix wrung their hands or shrugged before they walked away, who would know where to start anyhow? Some started praising him for whatever foamed out of his mouth, as genuine, sparkly and authentic. He didn't buy it, but it felt good for a while. I suppose it did sparkle as the sun hit, albeit with a sickening twist. He continued to deteriorate, this time, from the inside.

Once at the top of the elevator, I walked around the perimeter taking pictures of San Francisco. It’s a great vantage point, but visibility was low that day so my memories are better than the pictures I took! The walk down to Washington Square was a lot easier than the climb, but we were all tired and ready for some dinner by then. We were lured into Michelangelo’s Caffé and were impressed with the food and the service. Ice water was immediately provided (usually you have to ask for it in California) and soon after, a bowl of spicy black olives and a plate of bruschetta appeared along with the usual basket of bread. When the check came at the end of the meal, it was provided along with a plate of gummy bears and a plate of macaroons. We’re still talking about that lovely meal…

My solution? Slow down. Tell Dusty to take her time, notice the scenery, maybe have a cuppa and think this thing through. Has she really got the bad guy tied up? What if she got that all wrong? That would leave her all alone (except for a couple more would-be victims) with... the killer. And the only guy who would defend her? Well, he's tied up now, so smart move there Dusty.

As for the Guardianista mentality exhibited in the comments, the calls for pensions to shed stocks in News International, armaments, big tobacco and others (BP would right piss them off too, I suspect) are hilarious. How do they think pension payments are going to be met without hugely profitable industries like these in fund portfolios? After all, the Guardian and their readers squeal like stuck pigs when council workers are asked to pay more in.

More shocking, though, is that my sixty inch frame has not spontaneously burst into a ball of flames or split right down the middle like a cracking egg.

A moment that stood out was Emma Rosenthal‘s performance of “Pirate Jenny”. In a show that is performed in jest, with a multitude of group numbers and general mayhem, this performance, stripped of spectacle and being one of the restrained and subdued moments of the show, was a gem. Emma captivated the audience with her visceral rendition of the song that exuded raw emotion.
They both laughed, and fell right back into the random conversation they were leaving me out of.

I went for a search to find my profile subject. I went to the Gateway Mall to stroll through the shopping center to look for someone that struck me as interesting. I first waited 10 minutes to be rejected by a manicurist who did not have the time to be profiled. I then thought about talking to the group of gentlemen who I have seen in the mall reading in the same sitting area, but none of them had anything to say. I wondered into a vacant video arcade sucking down electricity to receive a one word, two letter, sentence of rejection from the manager. beginning to think that no one in the mall would want to be profiled, I saw the security office. Unfortunately, I was sent to the mall’s head office to run my idea through them before the 3rd party security would allow me to talk to them. Here I met the general manager for the mall Skip Sandgren. After speaking with him for 15 minutes about my idea, he agreed to allow me to profile him.
I found A Universe from Nothing awkwardly written and poorly explained; indeed, in places I felt completely at sea, and had to reread bits of it several times to figure out what he was trying to say. Even then some of it baffled me, and since I have a Ph.D. and have read a fair amount of popular physics literature, I figured this must have been a case of unclear writing rather than simple ignorance on my part.

Waking to a Leopard calling in the drainage line beside my room I was keen to get out there as it is still something outstanding on our Christmas List along with Buffalo and Giraffe. The latter two were going to be the mornings priorities but they could always wait a little while. So setting off from camp we headed directly to the North and began our search reaching the area I thought I heard it calling from we found tracks for a large male Leopard. This was not exactly good news, as the chances of finding it were very low and I decided not to expend the energy on finding it only to have it run away after a few seconds. So it was back to Plan A and we turned South but before leaving Motswari we bumped into a small breeding herd of Elephant. Never passing up the opportunity to spend time with these gentle giants we parked ourselves in the centre of the herd and sat with them for the next hour while they went about their feeding and interacting. It is the beauty of having guests stay an extended period of time, you can sit and spend time with things and actually observe their behaviour and not have the pressure of trying to find

It was about Noon when we walked into Pat’s Pub. Actually I scurried in and made a beeline for the back, as my brother Richie sauntered over to the bar. If you have ever seen the movie ‘A Bronx Tale’, think about the scene when the motorcycle club meets up with the mobsters in their bar. That bar was very similar to what Pat’s looked like. It was a very small place, with a square bar in the front and a Jukebox, some tables and a shuffleboard in the back. I think it used to be a place called Jerry’s Hardware a few years before. Either way, it had the vibe of a social club in someone’s living room. As I nervously fumbled with my selections, my brother bellies up to the bar, confidently puts two five dollar bills on it, while lighting up a Parliament. Right now there are exactly two people in the bar besides us. One is the bartender, and the other is a grizzled older man who sits nursing a beer and probably a hangover from the

Anyways I am sorry I haven't been on much. I have still been reading everyone's blogs but haven't been responding much because typing is hard and it hurts.
The green is the worst of the two colours I tried. It writes with a faint, washed-out, olive-coloured ink that is nearly too faint to read. While the orange is acceptable, even it is fairly borderline when it comes to readability.

We recently decided to change the name of this blog to “Waving, not drowning”. Even though at times it seems as if life can be a bit overwhelming, on the whole it is all good fun and worth shouting about. With so much gloom and doom around us, we thought it appropriate to express our optimism!
From her, I found out that some of our block mates have gone a long way since college. For one thing, I found out that the class president PATRICK DELA CRUZ is now the head of promotions for Enchanted Kingdom. JENNA NAZARENO, who was one of the most industrious in the class pursued foreign language and is now a successful Nihonggo and English online teacher and earns double than those who work outside of their home! JOHN GESTER GATUS on the other hand has made a career in call center and is now a team leader. Meanwhile, JANE ALEJANDRO has inherited their fruit business and now has succeeded in owning her own fruit plantation. Her bestfriend CASEY GANELO is now married to her longtime boyfriend, they now have two kids and have successfully built a growing printing business specifically targeting students who are doing their theses. One of the achievers of the class, GOLDAH JOIS TERTE, left her job as an account executive just when she was about to be promoted to pursue her religious calling. On the other hand, her friend BEVERLY VALENCIA, has finally accepted her promotion in Ayala Corporation and is now an executive for corporate communications. Despite her fortune, she never did a boob job but has undergone major trips to the spa for body scrubs and is now as fair skinned as KATE MANUEL is when I saw her while I was covering the Philippine Fashion Week. She’s now a professional ramp model and has also appeared in various fashion editorials.

Now we are in recession and consumer expectations and expenditures are a little all over the place, but it does seem that Tesco and Marks lost sight of the customer and their needs, especially in a changing market.
The story focuses on the strains within a WWII company of US soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge. The company is under the command of Capt. Cooney (Eddie Albert), a privileged man who joined the army to satisfy the wishes of his father. However, Cooney is an undisguised coward whose position only remains tenable due to his friendship with Col. Bartlett (Lee Marvin), the battalion commander. The situation in the company has reached crisis point after Cooney’s inaction has caused the death of a squad of Lt. Costa’s (Jack Palance) men. When orders come through that a small town must be taken and held, Costa delivers an ultimatum to his superior – if he fouls up again then Costa will kill him.
yeah sure, some of the stuff that happened in this book annoyed me, but in a i-understand-why-it-had-to-happen-even-though-i-REAAALLLLY-wish-it-didn't kinda way. and besides clara's voice is just so...AWESOME, that because of it the book's a great read anyway. bring on the sequel!

While fundamentalist Christianity impacts the teaching of science in public schools, particularly in those regions where politicians pander towards the faithful, it is primarily the more ‘moderate’ forms of religiosity that affect people’s lives lives. Be it discrimination against gays or denying proper healthcare and reproductive choice to women, religously-based resistance to equality and choice is derived almost entirely from the core doctrines of the major denominations, such as the Roman Catholic church. Such teachings on homosexuality and birth control are based on religious grounds— primarily the revealed opinions of an unquestioned and even unquestionable deity—and are therefore not amenable to secular reasoning.

His house was a mess; he had no love life. His family was deceased, or estranged. When he thought of friends, the faces he saw were children’s. He did not mark Christmas, but every twenty-fifth of December went on foot to the local park and collected one blade of grass from that place he had been sitting when he realised he could be happy and alone.
When we look at the combined home runs of the AAA and AA teams of the other National League East teams the Phillies’ Lehigh Valley and Reading teams are last in combined home runs. Reading is still scoring runs with a high slugging percent but are doing it not with the long ball. Lehigh Valley is near the bottom in most offensive categories in the International League.

There’s good news and bad news, regarding Matt Busse and Chris Dumond’s story in Lynchburg’s News & Advance. The good news is that it named Kenneth Davis by name and by race. That saves me from having to make some fruitless phone calls. The basis for the identification is the police affidavit that resulted in a judge issuing a search warrant for Davis’ family’s apartment; thus, the Lynchburg police have not been completely corrupted. (Fruitless, because if the police had not named and racially identified Davis in the affidavit, they would have refused to provide me said information, due to his age.)

I just spent fifteen minutes debating with my fourth graders, who insisted that you can see X-Rays. (An answer on their homework was that x-rays are invisible.) Never mind that the story mentions that X-Rays are invisible at least twice; the kids are so used to the actual pictures being called X-Rays that they couldn’t wrap their heads around the fact that the actual beam being shot from the camera is what an X-Ray is.

So will friends and family catch shingles from you? No, you cannot catch shingles, since it comes from the virus in your nerves becoming active again after many years. You can spread the virus when someone who has never had chickenpox touches the shingles rash or fluid from it. However, this person would develop chickenpox and not shingles. Once the rash has crusted, you are no longer able to spread the virus.

First, the Scripture does have something to say about modesty, and it all begins with one’s approach to the Lord (1 Peter 3:15). The KJV uses the word “modest” only in 1 Timothy 2:9; it comes from a Greek word (kosimos) that means “well-arranged.” The actual Greek word is used one other time and that is in the next chapter (3:2); a man who desires to be an elder must be a male “of good behavior” (NKJV), “orderly” (KJV). The KJV uses the words “modest apparel” in 1 Timothy 2:9, while other translations will read, “suitable apparel with modesty” (NET), “respectable apparel with modesty” (ESV), “dress modestly with decency and propriety” (NIV).
What I love about this? Asymmetry. I love asymmetry in jewelry. This necklace again has that little touch of whimsy and of course little birds! Again this is a dress up dress down necklace.

Talked with Jack briefly before the start to understand the intent of the WOD. Specifically, would we be working the squats from the rack or the floor? His direction was that if there were enough racks available, we could work from the rack. He pointed out that the effort on the squat shouldn’t be limited by the clean required to get the bar off the floor. I was relieved to hear that. I chose 135# for the squats, sticking to my mindset of working at around 70% of Rx. It was a challenging but not overwhelming weight.

Author P.J. Haarsma built a game which attracted a huge audience that became the core supporters of his books. The game community helped test storylines and championed the books to their friends, too.The women behind Readergirlz have built a community around authors, books, and reading. The site is a destination offering interactivity, changing content, and projects that involve offline participation, as well. While the site is not directly about the Readergirlz “divas” themselves, the connection to the readers still exists for them individually as well as collectively.

So my friend's problem is this doesn't distinguish peaking power costs. He's not using the denialist line that baseload power can't include solar at all, but that you still require additional power when solar can't provide it. That additional power is expensive, and this cost externality isn't included in LCOE calculations.

I remember going inside the house at some point and the inside of the house looked very different from in real life and there was a second floor, and I remember that a text message from my former classmate JC was sent to a caller ID-like thing in a fish tank in the first room near the door.
How many do we have in America? So exactly how mad are they at us? Let me say this. I don’t want to get blown up in a building for something that had absolutely nothing to do with me. I’m a good person. Yes I have a big mouth and talk a lot of smack and have a high opinion, but does that really deserve a suicide bombing death?

A large aspect of writing YA and MG books is to be relatable to teens. Provide five adjectives to describe your high school experience.
Growing up, I would be asked what I wanted to be. A teacher, a youth worker, some occupation relating to children. I really wanted to be a mother but that is not valued and not classed as a career. It didn't matter what I wanted to be, there was always someone who thought I was not good enough to do what I thought I could do. I was too shy, I was not suited to it and I wasn't a people person.

But at this point that doesn’t matter. The goal for the first draft is to get your ideas down on paper. See the story beyond your initial thoughts and then figure out what needs to be brought up and what needs to be knocked down. And I have a feeling a lot in 12 and 13 can be thrown out. But that’s OK.
It's a decent story that unravels (perhaps not quickly enough) into a twisted, manic episode that would have felt right at home on FX's sleazetastic surgery porn show Nip/Tuck.

A recent great tree blog got me thinking again, about another subject I had set off to the side for a later date, I planned on doing this tree blog for over a year, but kept putting it off, every time I go hiking I’m reminded of this subject, it is another tough topic, tired of the scoffers and deniers of reality I just kept away from the chemtrails and contrails issues. I recently stood on a 10,000ft ridge by Lake of the Woods in Wyoming looking out over the Wind River Range North slopes, the dead and dying trees were painful for me to see, recognizing a dying forest and wondering why, I have hiked here off and on since 1976, another blog about the White Bark Pines caused me to dig out these old files and go to work. Here is what I think is harming the worlds trees, not just America’s.

I'm not sure what I will do with this little space, but it definitely will not be filled back up with junk. Also, the windows look dirty but it's actually the screens I have on my home. They are thick black insolated screens which help keep the house cool in summer and make looking out of the windows a bit iffy.

The B-side to the 7-inch single is a track called "Rollercoaster". This track was moved to the A-side alongside a remixed version of the title track for the British 12-inch single and was released as a double A-side backed with a cover version of The Doors' "People Are Strange", which was recorded for the soundtrack of the film The Lost Boys and was released as a single in its own right the following year (1988). The U.S. 12-inch single had the same A-side as the British 12-inch single with two other mixes of the title track on the B-side.
