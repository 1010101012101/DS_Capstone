(And back to me again: I don't know what Jim Hightower knows about craft-brewed beer other than drinking it, but I presume the theme of his speech will be to praise the microbrewing Davids vs. the Bud/Coors/Miller Goliaths, as little guys vs. big corporations is the thread that has run through his entire activist career.)

Six months have passed since I last talked to you. What ever happened to the band in this half-year?
The first few steps when I started running were terrifying. I was afraid I'd hit the pavement hard with my heel and it would crack. My heel, not the pavement.
The Hamilton Watch Company introduced their first line of wristwatches in 1917, and they were widely regarded as the finest American timepieces of their day. Most of these early models are considered treasures today and they are highly collectible. A partial list of their most popular watches includes The Coronado, The Spur, The Oval, The Rectangular, The Tonneau, the Pinehurst, The Byrd, The Cambridge, The Flintridge, the Glendale, and the Langley. Most of these models were handcrafted using only the finest, most expensive materials, like silver and gold.
The issue there was whether the world’s map makers would continue to call the body of water the “Sea of Japan,” as Tokyo wanted, or also label it the “East Sea,” as Seoul had been requesting. For weeks before – and then during- the meeting on the sunny Riviera, diplomats and maritime officials from Tokyo and Seoul had thrown uncharacteristically harsh words at each other.

On Monday we took a group of young adults on a day long spiritual retreat. I was able to go for a walk with my husband along some old train tracks through some incredibly lush forest. Loved it!
The AR15 grip is held on by one lonely screw. The house Pachmayr gunsmithing screwdriver set had a slotted insert that fit the screw perfectly. It was the work of a moment to unscrew the old grip, and ready the rifle for it's new handle. Of course, that work of a moment was followed by several minutes searching for the SMALL SPRING that lives under the grip. Using the secret magic words (%$# @#%$# ^$@$%#*+^# (^$$@$@), the spring was recovered and installed under the new Hogue grip.
I have to ask...I know you are going to reply "no idea," but maybe someone else can enlighten me. Somehow over the year, my links to your site changed. I used to get an email with a link to your site. Now...I only get an email with the whole text listed. (so if I never go to your site do you get the "hit"?) I digress...I've tried to change my sign up to your site, but am unable to just get an emailed link, it only emails me the full text. I like going to your site because I can read comments and see all the exciting pictures, etc. I know, more rambling than you care to read, but it's annoying. Have you heard this from anyone else? Am I just blog impaired?

First and foremost, the editing and filming style were annoying. I can forgive the fact that they don't delve too deeply into the story, but the pacing of the movie was just off. It was like the Games on Xanax. You KNOW you're supposed to feel something, but you're not quite getting there.
Probably my favorite month usually. After all, it starts to get warmer (you know, during normal years when mother nature doesn’t say ‘fuck it’ and make it 85 degrees in February), the world is bright green again, and oh hey — my birthday!
I returned the steaks, with their natural juices, right back into the pan for about a minute. Total cooking time, was less than 20 minutes. Because I started my potatoes, first, and they were cut nice and small, they were cooked about the same time as the steaks. Using my food mill, I had creamy spuds with a bit of butter, a touch of cream cheese, and a splash of milk...okay, a tiny splash of heavy cream, too.

Onto Scottsdale, Arizona where I have tons of new family because my wife is from Tucson. So is Ben, but despite being in Arizona, it never came up. I like California too Ben, but repping Zona is a good idea. There are saguaros there and those are pretty awesome.

Now, this is something that is near and dear to my heart. Terri and I have been vendors at the Springfield Extravaganzas for about 9 years, and this year they are adding their very first Vintage Marketplace (at Springfield), and it’s being hosted by none other than the Queen of JUNK herself…Sue Whitney of JUNKMARKET Style. So….in addition to over 2,000 vendors covering almost every inch of the Clark County Fairgrounds from May 18th – 20th, there will be over 40 vendors (from all over the country) under tents near the center of the Clark County Fairgrounds – selling all manner of repurposed, recycled, upcycled treasures – from jewelry to furniture - as well as tons of fabulous vintage and antique finds (these vendors are serious treasure hunters, and we/they have scoured the countryside to find the very best and most unique things possible).
Now – from the abusive Comment in my previous post I deduce that there may be some people who would like all of this, and more, buried. The message is clear – if you bring it up, your character may be questioned. There will be flak. It’s already the case that some people are reluctant to say much in public about these sorts of things (because you never know who might mark one of your future bids for funding, etc), and not just matters relating to Intute, and the best course is therefore usually assumed to be: tow the line/keep quiet. This doesn’t affect me anymore, because I’m retired, and I’m prepared to bring things up, and I’m not put off doing so by personal abuse.
Its been a busy week, full of emotional ups and downs here.
An actor, no – a beauty therapist, no – a Work At Home Mum, no – a Stay At Home Mum, no – a nurse… Oh dear. Um, ok, if I never had to work again what would I like to do? (Aside from twice weekly pilates, running group, long lunches, guitar and spanish lessons, play group, mums and bubs yoga… I could go on!) I’d love to work a couple of days per week doing something that utilises my organisation and people skills, that really has a positive impact on the the world around me. I think I’d like to do project management for a charity or non government organisation. Would I need to study project management for that?
I am not being in anyway naive or idealistic regarding being able to prosper to some luxury or to become filthy rich off the land.

Then I got up from the operating chair and walked to a little stool across the room with Gary so he could check out my eyes. It was one of those eye scope things where you put your chin and your forehead on the rests and they look at your eye. So Gary checked both of my eyes for about a minute each, and then said, "Looks perfect. Thank you, Brianna, it was a pleasure working with you." I shook his hand and then the nurse walked me out of the operating room.

‘There are no moral phenomena at all, but only a moral interpretation of phenomena–’
No religious person denies that Jesus is spiritual. While Jesus abhorred religious abuse and corruption he did not abolish religion or religious practice. This idea about Jesus is more a contemporary sentiment. Jesus, on the contrary, comes to "fulfill" the law. This fulfillment has a lot to do with our salvation, especially since we are sinners. How then is it that Jesus, who is "spiritual" is also "religious?" Take another look at the Gospel from last Sunday. The Evangelist records that after healing the leper of his leprosy, Jesus says to him, "...go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." Jesus leads the leper, a man of faith, to fulfill the religious requirements.

One of the main problems they had when they lived in the house was rats. Moody himself hunted them with his rifle in the basement, and in gratitude, a host of them climbed up into the walls and died, the stench of their putrefying flesh making itself manifest during a major State dinner.

The manual states, “These operations may be performed as domestic civil support operations,” and adds that “The authority to approve resettlement such operations within U.S. territories,” would require a “special exception” to The Posse Comitatus Act, which can be obtained via “the President invoking his executive authority.” The document also makes reference to identifying detainees using their “social security number.”

This one picks up right where the first one left off. Gideon is asked to try to talk a former colleague out of a hostage situation. When that goes badly, he finds himself in the middle of a terrorist plot with only 10 days to stop it. The mystery of who is trying to start a war on American soil was pretty good. With a couple of possibilities on the table, I wasn't truly sure who was behind it. There were also a few twists that I liked. Gideon's Corpse also has some great action scenes that helped to build the tension.

My husband and I are both fairly new to the Army, and have plenty to learn over the years to come. However, becoming an Army wife and dealing with a lot over the past 15 months has only helped us to grow as a couple and mature as people. We are so blessed to have the Army as a part of our lives, and especially for the people we have met. I think I can speak on behalf of my husband when I say that we have met some of our truest and closest friends upon this chapter of our lives. God truly has a plan for us, and I thank him every day for leading us down this path.
It’s important to note that the differences between print and digital are big too. Print uses a four colour process CMYK (cyan,magenta,yellow,black) or Pantone colours, whereas web uses RGB (red, green, blue). Sometimes colour matching is impossible between the three, so keep that in mind if you want your website to reflect the look of your print book.

He is going to his friend’s son’s soccer game at 1 (why do they schedule these things when the sun is the highest?) and then on to see another friend at the hospital where the friend had a baby yesterday. He asked if I wanted to go along to see the new baby, but my hair and make up aren’t done. He always does this to me…asks me at the last moment when I am not made up. And then I have to rush to get ready to see people I don’t want to see because they make me self-conscious. And worst yet, I am at my mother’s house when he asked, so how in the heck am I expected to do my hair?

The author starts off his introduction revealing the theme of Philippians as being joy. This gives me a good impression about Paul’s Letter to the Philippians. It tells the reader that the writer of this epistle was a person who will hope-filled rather than one who was burdened down with suffering. Suffering in the midst of hope and joy is what the suffering church needs to hear—even today.

Yet this person has no idea how to use many common words in the English language, such as 'mortify.' I never correct her barbaric use of words. Why would I? It would hurt her feelings.

Children should be kept home if ill. The City is monitoring public schools for sudden increases in influenza-like illness (ILI). If a school nurse sees 5 or more cases of students exhibiting ILI in one day, the school will send a letter to parents and guardians stressing the need to keep sick children home. If a school nurse reports ILI in 4% (a minimum of 15 students) of the school’s students on a given day, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene will conduct an on-site assessment of the school and work with the school to strengthen its flu prevention efforts.

The decor probably hasn't changed a great deal since then, either. The front of this Montparnasse bar/restaurant is pretty unassuming, so I was pleasantly surprised to walk in and find such a charming and warm little spot with its comforting 30's vibe and white jacket clad barmen. The bar stools are packed like sardines along the counter, but there are plenty of tables and chairs for those who might want a bit more space (or to sample something off their dinner menu).
Happy Sunday, everyone! I hope that your day has been going well so far, and that you had a wonderful weekend. I went ice skating with my cousin and her family yesterday. Her daughter, Kyla, wanted to go for her birthday because they had done it on a class trip and she loved it! Kyla improved so much yesterday while skating, and she had such a good time with her friend that she brought along. After that we all went to eat at Fuddrucker's together...then Josh and I came home and just relaxed the rest of the evening. We also had a fun Friday night with friends...so it has been a good weekend for us!
Then we spent all day Saturday doing work around my house. My cousin, aunt and uncle all came over to pitch in. We took down 3 trees in my backyard, re-grouted a bathroom floor and caulked a shower. It was a super productive day. After working around the house and yard all day, Mike and I went to his shooting competition awards dinner. He shot very well this year, his average went up by about 3 points which is huge for him. The gun club dinner isn't really my scene. I'm not all that into guns in general, and I'm not really that kind of person. It took a lot of effort to not be super judgmental, and this was the only picture I snapped while there.

There don't seem to be as many accidents on the road as you might think. Over four visits, this is my ninth week in India and I've travelled fairly extensively by road, both in town and long-distance. In that time, I've seen the accident I just described, one overturned auto rickshaw where the annoyed but unhurt passenger stood as the driver tried to right his vehicle and one dead dog.
I also began making cutsie Christmas ornaments out of wood, little brightly coloured angels, Santas, snowmen...you get my trend. I was invited to huge show in San Angelo, TX...it's right smack in the middle of TX and out in the middle of nowhere. I recall having to get of the Interstate and taking all these little back roads, passing one little pathetic town after another; they were once prosperous during the oil boom, but now just skeletal remains of mules and riggs dot the landscape. So we drive up into this little gem of a town, bustling with lots of action. We drove to Fort Concho, an old army post turned into a tourist spot, and I was very fortunate enough to be housed in one of the lovely little row houses that had once been occupied by the officers and their families. We set up, by we, I mean the ex and me, and were ready for the next few days of sells. The doors opened at high noon that Friday of Dec. 1, 1994 and I was overwhelmed by the attention my work received. I had people coming up to me telling me they "collected" my work...collected????? I was being collected?????!!! I had been discovered while selling my art at this little shop in Cloudcroft, NM, about 2 hours up the road and that's how I got the juried invite. So the whole experience was not only quite profitable, but very humbling. I made approximately $3K that weekend and was ready for the following year, which never happened. By 1995, my marriage was in the toilet, and I was being blamed for spending far too much time on my art work...suppose someone has to be blamed for others indiscretions, so I stopped doing art all together...he had stolen my joy. Of course after a few years of therapy, I realized I let him steal my joy!

This option allows me to become an RN a few years earlier.

Grossman notes that the range between losing your fine motor skills and losing your complex motor skills (115-145 beats per minute) is considered the optimal alertness state for fighters -- with a little training on how to manage the adrenaline. With extensive training, people can continue to function as they get into ranges where most people have frozen up or run away. People may not be able to do anything they haven't been trained on, which is why soldiers learn so many drills, but it's a valid way to keep them alive.

The “Casualties were small”
The process of writing a book is like living with a temperamental teenager. When you sit down at the table with them, you never know what you are going to get. You might encounter joyful exuberance where the words flow non-stop, or you may be faced with sullen silence. Just like with a rotten teenager, I found that the more quality time I spent with my writing, the less it glared at me refusing to budge. The look said I was an idiot for thinking I was a writer.

This weekend (boy is my husband in a donut rut lately), I made a batch of baked cake batter donuts. I got the recipe from Ryan on his adorably decorated website at Ryan’s Baking Blog. Even if you aren’t a donut person, you have to go to his website and see Natalya, the websites’ pug mascot. So cute! Seeing that my weight has increased by five pounds in two weeks, I am trying to reduce the amount of flour & sugar in my diet. The husband’s report was that while the donuts were good, they were a bit blander in flavor and very “cakey”. (Guessing that means they were too dense and not like enough…) The lemon frosting was a winner though – just make sure you add the zest and juice of 1 lemon.

A snowflake – Neva’s identity mark is a snowflake tattoo between her belly button and hip. I might copy Neva – although not the location, or probably the tattoo part. I love snow, not only the real, cold fluffy stuff that falls from the sky in the winter but also what it symbolizes – originality. In high school, I had a pin that said: Why be normal? If I could find it, I’d proudly wear it today.

Grandma was home, and the buns were still warm. Between bites, I told her everything. She was ready for me. "No Santa Claus!" she snorted. "Ridiculous! Don't believe it. That rumor has been going around for years, and it makes me mad, plain mad. Now, put on your coat, and let's go."

The first thought that comes to mind about Dancing at the Chance is "richly detailed." I could see myself at The Chance, sitting in the audience, or backstage with the performers. The amount of detail was also a put-off, though. The actual events of the story proceeded very slowly; the action was not the emphasis in this one.
This is my tribute to Roommate, who on multiple occasions in our seven-plus year friendship has acted and/or dressed in such ridiculous manners that it would be physically impossible for me to be depressed.

Heat one tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add half of the chicken strips, taking care not to crowd the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, until chicken appears mostly cooked and crumb coating is browned and golden. Remove to the prepared baking sheet and cook the remaining chicken strips in the same way. Remove remaining chicken strips to the baking sheet and bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Serve hot.
OK, friends, I have a little story to share. One I’m not happy about and one I’m working through. About a month ago, I met someone online. He’s not from here, but is moving here for his job and will be in the same city as me in less than a month. For the past three or four weeks, we’ve emailed, we’ve talked, we texted. We got to know one another pretty damn well. And when he found out when he was coming up here to apartment-hunt, he made it known he wanted to see me. Take me out, have dinner and drinks.
In Perelandra by CS Lewis, the main character feels rage at the Devil, who has taken over a human being and is tempting a new Eve on Venus. And he has the sense that this is what anger is for, that this anger is pure and right and this energy invigorates him.
If you'd like to send a card this week, there is a special lady in Oklahoma who will be 89 years old on March 6th. Just email me at onefineblessing (at) yahoo (dot) com saying you'd like to join in with me, and I will email you her address. By the end of the week, I should have a few more for the month of March. I will have it down eventually to only one email a month with a list.
I was talking to a good friend about this a few weeks ago and I listened to what she said. She says her studio is a safe place, it’s her place, it’s a spot where she can go and make mistakes and not have to worry about them. She can go investigate ideas. She also said she was having problems trying to sort out what she was making in her studio as well. Not entirely like my problems but similar enough. In the end, we decided that it would probably be helpful if I just went over to my studio and started making birds. because that’s what I wanted to do. Never mind what I thought I was supposed to do, just do what I wanted to. This is one of the successful little guys to come from this conversation.

First of all, all of us agree that we should use this opportunity to do something meaningful on debt and deficits. And the reports that have been out there have been largely accurate that Speaker Boehner and myself had been in a series of conversations about doing the biggest deal possible so that we could actually resolve our debt and our deficit challenge for a long stretch of time. And I want to say I appreciate Speaker Boehner’s good-faith efforts on that front.

This is how it is done (Yawn, boring): 1) you take control of the paychecks, 2) get a copy of the payroll from the prior period and the current period and make sure no one “vanished” between the two; then 3) distribute the paychecks personally to each employee, making each employee show real identification before he or she could get their checks. (This was in the days before direct deposit. I do not know how the process works now, but am sure there is a process.). No ID, no paycheck.
Anyway, you can see that if something took away the ability to use an electrical current here on Planet Earth then we’re pretty fucked. I was thinking maybe it will affect nuclear fission too. Hard to say. If I don’t then the nuclear plants will melt down due to insufficient control systems, which is actually probably a good thing in an apocalypse story.
We also have a sister-in-law who is in ICU with interstitial lung disease. Unfortunately, she likely won't make it. She is my age (in fact, we went to high school together; I've known Diane for 36 years now), and they have 2 daughters in their early 20s. My husband's brother is devastated, as are our nieces. Diane is heavily sedated and is on a ventilator. Doctors are trying a new medication that seems to be helping her body to relax enough to absorb the oxygen a bit better... but she likely won't make it. And if she does, she'll surely need to be on oxygen for whatever time she has left. A lung transplant was taken off the table for now, at least, as she would have to be transported to another hospital more than an hour away, and she wouldn't survive the trip.

In those same city motels, Mellor has been trying to build relationships and rebuild lives. He wants business owners to recognize what is going on in their properties. He wants the girls to trust him enough to ask for help.
Here would be a good place to examine exactly what a "vampire" is and ask, can Christians honestly consider it okay for teens (indeed anyone?) to crave a relationship with one? For centuries, vampires have been part of folklore and mythology, understood to be ugly, dark creatures of morbid horror, close to the dead, sometimes known as the undead for they claim eternal life and subsist by feeding on human blood, roam in darkness, avoid the light, and are enemies of the human race.

This individual believes he is telepathic and is looking for a neuroscientist to study him. The problem is that the telepathy he claims to have sounds reminiscent of the hallucinatory symptoms of schizophrenia. He recognizes this but argues that it is possible that most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia are also in fact telepathic. (He also makes the contradictory claim that he believes he may be the only person in the world with telepathy). He claims that an individual is talking to him, telling him that he is a worthless person, causing him to smell things that aren't there, and control muscles both on his face and in his gut.
Right on time, to prove that point, is this graphic novel adaptation of the Jack Vance short story of the same title, which tells the tale of Edwer Thissell, the new consul on the planet Sirene who fumbles along in a series of cultural mishaps that defy mastery. In a set-up worthy of Lewis Carroll, has to function on a world that, among other things, requires masks (governed by a complicated, symbolic hierarchy) be worn in public, that communication is achieved through a litany of musical instruments and song styles. Social cues on Sirene are realized through an etiquette born on an alien world and, therefore, the furthest thing from natural behavior and consideration to an off-worlder. When Thissell is charg ed with the task of tracking down an off-world criminal, he must navigate these differences to the deficit of his pursuit.

Recently Romney Attacked Sen. John McCain For Opposing Tax Cuts That, As Governor, Romney Rejected. "Taking aim at a rallying John McCain, New Hampshire front-runner Mitt Romney said Saturday that his GOP presidential rival had failed 'Reagan 101' by twice opposing President Bush's tax cuts. … 'He voted against the Bush tax cuts twice,' Romney said. 'That's failing Reagan 101. (Ronald) Reagan taught … almost all of us in the Republican Party that lowering taxes would grow the economy and was good for our economy and good for individuals."

Our investigation picked up with a visit to the Magic Library. Creskin and Don looked through a book I couldn't read. Looking at those two you would think they were a couple Nancy boys who would be terrified to piss in public. But they got an edge. Creskin tore out a page from a book. Wild man. That page ended up being some sort of door into a some sort of secret realm of Indrid Bliss.
Money. The thing we hate, but need the most. Study abroad costs money. This is one of the biggest reasons I’ve heard for why people choose not to study abroad. People not only think studying abroad is more expensive than it is, but they completely ignore the future pecuniary possibilities that can be gained.

Ideally, submissions will include a carefully developed argument in response to a single issue. Such responses may include empirical work; critical literature reviews which form scholarly responses to relevant questions related to distance education in the schools sector; or contextualised accounts from the schools sectors that are linked to established theory in distance education. Engagement with recent scholarly publications is expected. All submissions will receive a minimum of two reviewers undertaken following a ‘double blind’ peer review process.

“Since no one would have made up the idea of a crucified messiah, Jesus must have really existed, must really have been raised messianic expectations, and must really have been crucified. No Jew would have invented him. And it is important to remember that Jews were saying that Jesus was the crucified messiah in the early 30s.” (164)

In a rush to avoid death, we somehow accepted its certainty and with it we found clarity and stopped fearing. Instead, we became angry and rebellious. We began to fight for our dignity, refusing to be reduced to our animal denominator. We wanted more than just to survive. And we fought everywhere we could. We strengthened personal bonds and looked after the weakest and oldest in the neighborhood. We dressed up and accessorized each day and despite the scarcity of water we washed daily, albeit in the dark. We produced art, we wrote and we competed in ballroom dancing competitions.
Jesus came to raise up our stuck minds. Jesus did not come to press down his teaching to fit into our small and finite minds.
Now there are a few obstacles that I will need to find a way around, first and foremost I have no experience or even basic knowledge of sailing. The local community college does offer a sailing course with lessons on a nearby lake so that does not appear to be a showstopper. Other small issues are the costs of marina fees, repairs, and upkeep for a sailboat that I would insist remain on the coast. Continued funding for those expenses are trickier since college is quickly approaching for my son as is braces for my daughter, which one of those will ultimately cost the most is up in the air right now.

Then came the electronic possibilities. Ebooks were born. And for a while it seemed these Ebooks would be the wave of the future and another great source of income just for publishers. Actually, most agents would not look at your work, if you published anything and I do mean anything of that book on the web. Ebooks looked like they were going to belong to publishers.

Greece was also told by the Sprouts and the IMF that it MUST AT ALL COSTS sell all the family silver, all its infrastructure and all its publicly-owned businesses. All those concerned – the IMF, the ECB, Brussels, Merkel, and yes, even Sarkozy – said they wouldn’t get any more money until they passed a law guaranteeing to do that. I said at the time there would be no market for these assets, and Greece was being asked to flog the only card it had in its hand: the potential to get the economy going again.

I woke up for church the next morning, but all we really did was have an extended Sunday school meeting in which we discussed future social opportunities for us as a group. Somehow, the fact that I’m playing horn for a musical this summer got brought up, so everyone started making plans to visit Dallas as a group to see the musical I’m playing for, to maybe visit Six Flags, and to even go to the Medieval Times restaurant place in June, which is really cool! I’m excited to see if they’ll all be able to come and check it out.

He would be waiting for us by the front door with his disciplinary tool of choice, his belt.

Yet FIFA have repeatedly refused to implement such an idea as their party line has repeatedly been that they want to keep the game the same at grass roots level as in the top flight. Nevertheless, recently they have budged and are planning to introduce goal-line technology. This might help avoid incidents like the Lampard goal in South Africa, but the problem of officials making mistakes elsewhere on the pitch will unfortunately remain.

The Austin Statesman's Chuck Lindell reports ("Inmate challenges pedophilia test as junk science," March 2) on a legal challenge by TDCJ inmate Michael Arena - who was convicted of sexually assaulting two young cousins when he was a teenager - to use of a particularly insidious brand of junk science aimed at sex offenders called the Abel Assessment, which is based on similar principles to the penile plethysmograph. (Try saying that three times fast.) Neither forensic technique is allowed to be used at trial under modern evidence standards - and probably shouldn't have been in this case - but the plethysmograph is still used rather frequently in post-conviction settings in Texas, particularly among parolees who're assigned sex-offender conditions. The Abel Assessment suffers from an error rate of 35-48%, according to various estimates in Lindell's article. One study found "a 42 percent false-positive rate when non-molesters were tested."

There’s a type of seizure called a “rum fit” that only occurs after heavy alcohol intake. Mark said he never had seizures when sober; he may not have been epileptic, simply suffered seizures because of drinking. One night about a year ago he had a seizure driving a scooter and crashed, suffering a severe head injury. My uncle, a retired neurosurgeon who had operated on DUI cases in the middle of the night so many times over his career, recalls going to see his son at that same hospital he worked and experiencing a terrible sense of deja vu, to see a DUI case in that same emergency room, smelling that terribly familiar mix of blood and antiseptics and booze.

Annoyed. So many things have been going on recently and it just seems like everything is getting on my nerves. So apologies in advance if I bite your head off. I don’t mean to. It’s just dumb because I have it listen to people whine about random stuff and people who I thought were my friends are barely even talking to me anymore, etc. It just sucks. I’m a creature of habit; therefore, I hate big changes. So when it happens to me or something in my life, it can be hard for me to deal. Doesn’t mean I don’t try.

We have needed a new chicken coop for years. The bird’s old accommodations were an unused wood-shed built fairly close to the house. The shed wasn’t ideal, but it worked well enough. The ducks had a difficult time living there, mostly because they were fat (and Rouen ducks don’t fly) and couldn’t make it up the chicken run into the coop. The poor ducks had to be “captured” every night (imagine if you will, us chasing a couple of three foot tall, 30 lbs ducks around the yard, with all the squawking and quacking and wing-flapping and cursing you can fathom) and gently pushed through the little, wee chicken door.
In all the ongoing discussions regarding the “hacking” there has been little clear reporting of precisely what was done by Mr Mulcaire and the other investigators used by the press.

Kind God, give me fresh eyes to see you at work, showering these different gifts and works upon your people.

Correct my gaze when I separate gifts from you, the trinitarian Giver, or when I separate them from your people for whose sake they are given. Empower me to use what you have given me for the building up of your people. In Jesus’ name.

I met my new Writers Workshop students last night. Some students I already knew either because they’d graduated from Salford or they are part-timers and did two modules last year. There were two new faces.
As a student in England, Mehran comes to realize that, although English is his first language, it an English that drinks at the fountain of another tradition: "the rolling cadences of Keats and Tennyson had always been a music as distant from my ear as the assonances of Mir and Ghalib or Faiz were close." His literary explorations take him out not just towards the great Urdu literary tradition of the subcontinent, but also the less-known one of Sindh handed down to him by his mother: "What I really wanted was to understand the work of Shah Abdul Latif, Sachal Sarmast and Khwaja Ghulam Farid, the great poets of the Indus Valley who used those age-old tales of blighted loves my mother had told us to map the experiences of the soul's longing for its origins." The voices and veneration of poets are something that he also shares in his relationship with Marvi, whose Urdu is as good as his and whose Sindhi is better; they arrive at an understanding of their condition through art's infinite power to permeate and clarify human realities:

On Friday, I scuttled outside, after my stupid moon website said it would be up, and nothing. We had cloud cover, so I went back in and waited, pacing, antsy, in need of my picture. Back out an hour later. Nothing. I paced some more. Back out. Absofreakingnothing. Went to bed. Tossed and turned, thinking of the moon.

Once everything is ready, you can preheat your oven to 190°/375° and assemble your dish. Lightly oil your large baking dish and mix 1 ladle of your béchamel sauce into your meat mix and 3 ladles into your drained pasta. Add enough sauce to coat the bottom of your dish and then add 1/2 of your noodles. Follow with 1/2 of your meat and then repeat with remaining noodles and sauce. Top with the remaining béchamel sauce and grated cheese. Bake in a hot oven for 45-60 minutes. You want your edges to be bubbly and the cheese to be golden brown. Rest at least 30 minutes before serving to help set-up and make easier to dish out and hold form!!!

I wish it was different. I am sure that we, in the academic study of Judaism and Christianity, could benefit from serious Muslims scholars, who dedicated themselves to the study of the two other Abrahamic religions. Until we see more Muslim scholars in Judaism and Christianity, we have to settle with the polemics of the Medieval times.
As far as how I found myself on your ‘blog’ (weird word, wut?), I was surfing the net in search of comedy. I love to laugh. One site had a link to LicktheFridge, and the name really intrigued me. How clever, and please don’t ever lick mine! So off to it, I clicked and went. I do not remember at which site I was as I had visited too many that evening. The link was lies and jokes and lies–the post about your sonny boy, the poo, & your innocent, but blamed, neighbor.
The Gradys are back. And so is their archenemy.
Then, I had an "aha" moment, that I should prepare the meals the night before, then turn on the crockpot before leaving for work. D'oh! So, I bought America's Test Kitchen Slow Cooker Revolution Cookbook... and the book ended up sitting on my bookshelf for a few weeks. I finally made time to read the cookbook, and I have to say that it's well worth the investment. There is a lot of updated information on how to choose a slowcooker, and a lot of valuable tips from America's Test Kitchen. The first recipe I made, and posted, was Easy Barbequed Ribs, and those turned out to be easy to prepare and very tasty.
One current Welsh poet/writer whose work I enjoy very much is Chris Madoch. His poetry, which often explores the gay experience, is delivered in a knowing, declamatory fashion, and with considerable wit and skill. Is there a canon of explicit gay Welsh poetry? I’m really not sure – maybe Chris Madoch IS that tradition. Perhaps he is our very own John Giorno or Allen Ginsberg. I don’t know if the soi-disant Queer Messiah is on the Welsh literary circuit but he would certainly enliven it, and deserves a much wider audience.

The ‘car’ Caylee’s grandmother was referring to was used by her own daughter, Caylee’s mother. The day the child was reported missing, Casey’s parents went to the impound yard to retrieve Casey’s car, where it had been towed. The car smelled like a body had been decomposing in it, the impound yard manager and Casey’s father claimed later. As a nurse, Cindy knew the odour immediately. She later recalled asking her husband after driving home, “What died?”, not actually thinking that there had ever really been a dead body in the car at the time she made the statement. The car was owned by her parents, but it was driven by Casey alone.
Okay, so, I just wrote about it. It’s in the blog. I do what my girl says. Plain and simple. Now, maybe it’s girly of us, but talking is our thing. I love talking to Wifesy about anything and everything. It’s a blast. Our conversations never get old and if that’s not one of the keys to a relationship, then I don’t know what is. We always have hilarious repartees like this. Almost immediately following the gayby conversation we had another one. I’ve been going on a lot of job interviews lately and Wifesy and I decided that I needed a new, hot, outfit. The conversation, over breakfast, went something like this:
God can even use your failures as fodder in the parenting process. Jinny, a mom of two tweens, shares openly with them about the difficulties she experienced in childhood, and talks about how God used those hard things to form her character.

“Um,” John faltered, unsure what the safe answer was. He hadn’t planned on having sex with his wife but now that the possibility presented itself, he’d felt keen to exploit it. “It’s been a nice, relaxing weekend, I guess,” he said eventually, and held his breath, waiting for her to change her mind.
1. I’m unsure why, but I get asked—quite often—about the hardest part of being a father. The people who ask me this are almost all younger cats who are about to become fathers or are there already. That question is a Pandora’s Box. Being a father is hard in a million different ways: Balancing fatherhood with partnership; being able to do the things that I love to do on a consistent basis (for example, writing—I’m writing this at 3am, while everyone is asleep and I have a moment to myself); the loss of money; having to send your child to childcare because both parents have to work to afford all the additional costs. Working all day, coming home at night and only seeing your child for forty-five minutes before their bedtime—in these ways and more, daddyhood is hard as hell. But none of this (yes, even the money problems) even comes close to the raging difficulty of being a father of color.
And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.
And it’s hard to forget the room full of eleventh grade boys I spent twenty minutes of class time on showing them how to tie their neckties – a new-this-year uniform addition that came without instruction manual.

On Tuesday night, someone dear to me had called me a "strange girl," so the quirky details of Wednesday's ensemble felt very appropriate.
For example: In last Sunday’s Rapport newspaper, dated 27 March 2011, which I only happened to read this morning, the main front-page displayed a wide-strip colour image of men wearing red t-shirts with the words “JESUS” printed on them. The image was displayed across the uttermost top portion of the page, a spot which immediately attracts reader’s attention, and which newspapers often use as advertising space. The words, “BUCHAN IN BOSVELD - 12” were prominently displayed in the top left corner of the image, alerting readers that the full report is continued on page 12.
So, we had a bunny for the day. My sons named her Moo which seemed very fitting. Then we found out she belonged to a neighbor down the street and her real name is Cookie...I like our name better.
One aspect of my PSP that I didn’t think about is that by riding my bike or only taking public transportation I really reduced the amount of stuff I want to buy at a store. I have a huge problem with over shopping at a grocery store especially if I’m feeling a little hungry when I get there. However, when I only have my two reusable bags and, I have to carry them back or haul them back on my bike, I’m much less likely to buy everything that sounds good! I’ve saved money grocery shopping thanks to this; I buy just what I need, not everything I want.

It pours a deep honey-orange with just the faintest touch of yellow, a little transluceent with rocky beige head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is intense orange pine hops. If you've ever opened a bag of dried hops then you'll know the smell, it's that wonderfully intense fresh, green almost wet aroma that makes me salivate, it's one I really love. It's briefly smooth over the tongue, which surprised me, with some pleasant pine and orange marmalade flavours, rich and fruity. Then it begins. Slowly at first, a dry creeping pine bitterness builds, sucking at your tastebuds drawing out the moisture. The astringency doesn't stop, relentlessly building, steadily planing your tongue with a hop-edged cutting tool. This beer defines bitter.
I got these MS felt alphas after Christmas for super-cheap at Michael's, but I couldn't really think of how to use them. There's not enough to make a big title, and they seem pretty limiting. But, after a close look, I realized that I could probably slice the holly off them!

Foucault focused on the way certain areas of “knowledge gained authority and believability within dominant social formations” and sought to expose the regulation and control of the human body by the medical fraternity (Cregan, 2006: 46). Through his study of the treatment of the mentally ill in the eighteenth century, he noted that the power structures involved in their care, sought mainly to remove those exhibiting abnormal social behaviour from society (Cregan, 2006: 46). This removal of undesirable’s from society subjected them to social control in the form of medical treatment.

My best friend is about to have her first child, while another dear friend is trying to find a good preschool for her first daughter, and has a set a of twins about to celebrate their first birthday. Whenever it comes up, people ask me if I want kids, and I say no. They typically respond with "no?" when what they really want to say is "Why?"

If you don’t know what folding is, basically it is the repetitive act of taking a spatula and drawing a line through the center of your mixture, then coming around the side of the bowl back to the center and repeat as necessary. You want to be very gentle so as not to deflate your egg whites. It was a lot of hassle to get the egg whites into proper form. Don’t let that work go to waste! Now that you’re all folded in and the mixture has almost doubled in size, go ahead and pour into your dish.

The Spy Who Loved Me is a good James Bond book. I know he thought that it was terrible and felt that the experiment in writing about Bond from a woman's point of view failed miserably but that simply isn't the case (he hated it so much, he asked that it not be reprinted--ever). You can make the case that Fleming stank at writing from a female point of view, because I don't think Vivienne Michal sounds much like a real woman at all, but that's a minor point and we must admit that most male writer do not write female characters very well. Female writers, on the flip side, also do not write male characters very well. It's a Mars / Venus thing. You can't write about what you don't understand.
And to my step-mom, April, whom I would call my second mother. Where do I start to explain how blessed I am to have you in my life. You’ve been absolutely amazing. I’ve shared some of my deepest conversations and secrets with you, my emotions and tears and you’ve been nothing but supportive since day 1. I do consider my dad to be quite the catch and anyone to have him should be lucky, but just as so, he’s absolutely lucky to have an amazing wife such as you. Your patience is indescribable – and I will never be able to fully express my gratitude for you. I’ve inherited an amazing family via you. Thank you for EVERYTHING, and though that maybe a vague statement I truly mean EVERYTHING.

This is a film about dance - about the Argentine Tango to be precise - but it's also a film about cinema as a creative force. Cinema, as a spectacle, is a kind of dance; an expression of movement and emotion. The bodies within the frame play out this intricate choreography, which suggests, in its motions, stances, attitudes and positions, a variety of stories (of love and anger, sorrow and betrayal); but the dancers are matched at every step by the chorography of the camera, the intonations of the editing and the rhythms of the music. When placed together in collaboration these elements create a story; the story of a man and a woman.

Bi-doshic indicates that you share qualities strongly with two doshic types, and is actually how most of us are. People with dual constitutions (vata-pitta, pitta-kapha, and vata-kapha) are, in a sense, “split.” Under certain conditions, one dosha will predominate and under other circumstances the other dosha will.
However there are properties and then there are properties. I stated at the beginning of the book that I don’t like a lot of loose talk about “properties” and that ultimately I think that physical properties are the only kind of properties that there are. If I am going to qualify that at all (and at the end of this discussion you will be left with your own judgment to decide how far I have gone in that direction, and if too far), then I had better try to be a good deal more precise about what I mean by “formal properties.”

In five of the ballots the workers voted for strike action and in two of them the workers voted against (with one of those two voting for action short of a strike). The union therefore has a mandate to call for a lawful strike against five of the seven employers. It is free to coordinate the strikes so that they happen on the same, or consecutive days, but it is important to bear in mind that there will be five different strikes, each based on a separate ballot.

“Sources close to Grenell say that he was specifically told by those high up in the Romney campaign to stay silent on the call, even while he was on it. And this was not the only time he had been instructed to shut up. Their response to the far right fooferaw was simply to go silent, to keep Grenell off-stage and mute, and to wait till the storm passed. But the storm was not likely to pass if no one in the Romney camp was prepared to back Grenell up. Hence his dilemma. The obvious solution was simply to get Grenell out there doling out the neocon red meat – which would have immediately changed the subject and helped dispel base skepticism. Instead the terrified Romneyites shut him up without any actual plan for when he might subsequently be able to do his job. … And it’s a mark of Romney’s fundamental weakness within his own party that he could not back his spokesman against the Bryan Fischers and Matthew Francks.

Bad news, y'all. I turned off my resurrected cell phone last week because the battery was dying and the beeping at 3 a.m. was enough to make me want to fastball it back into the pool. But the thing wouldn't turn on the next morning at all, even after I exposed its little battery and gave it a thorough exam and a full charge—which is disappointing because now I'm forced to rethink what constitutes a miracle, like when I got all excited about Snuggies.
"There's a bear, " called the man. "How close?" asked the mom. The man pointed to a spot about 20 yards in front of us, just to the left of the trail.

The family stopped, children pushed behind them and waited to see what the little bear would do.

SoftSwim: Softswim is similar to chlorine but different in that it kills bacteria differently. Softswim acts as microscopic fly paper. The bacteria (and algae) are attracted and stick to it where they die. Millions of other microscopic particles also accumulate on the it and the chemical is ultimately trapped in the filter. These “sticky” particles accumulating in the filter make chemical cleaning of the filter essential. When adding Softswim to your pool or spa be sure to follow the manufactures instructions.

Today, nearly 5,000 vaccine injury claims are sitting in limbo because they represent children, who suffered brain and immune system dysfunction after vaccination but have been diagnosed with regressive autism, which is not recognized by the program as a compensable event.

McCormack provides the possibility for the most prominent theologian of the 20th century, and possibly the 21st century, to instruct evangelicals to faithfully engage the challenges of modernity/postmodernity. Like Barth, evangelicals must make ad hoc use of contemporary philosophy in answering the questions posed by the culture, answering with a yes but no. Evangelical pastors in particular have an obligation as professionals to critically appropriate the culture to more effectively minister to the culture, and engagement with Barth as a model will serve the Church better than reactionary, fearful disengagement.

I came across something I did recognise in one of the drawers, an old pullover, something I actually remembered Dad wearing around the house, something he’d had when we had still been a family. Or when we imagined we were still a family. A house is no more a home any more than a group of relatives automatically make up a family and families can be as much about pushing people away as they are about supposedly letting them in. I thought to bury my face in it, the pullover, but I stopped before I’d really started. Not me. Too melodramatic. And I have no idea why that would’ve been a bad thing, to slip out of character for a moment in the privacy of my father’s… of my own flat. Who was watching? God? Dad? I sniffed it instead. It was fusty. It didn’t even have that ‘old man’ odour; it had probably been years since he wore it. For some reason I tossed it on the bed not exactly sure what I might do with it later.

I started wondering what exactly it would be like to a person on at the edge, in the shadows, someone who did not operate within the confines of societies strict rules. And who made societies strict rules?And why were they so often considered “right” if they changed so much over the years?
MW3 has the edge when it comes to graphics. Some of the scenes that you play in the campaign are well designed and the graphic engine really shines. Black Ops graphics aren’t all that great, they are not bad, but when you are in the next generation of graphics, you need to be top-notch. From the environments to the little details on the guns, MW3 has the edge by a fairly large margin.
I'm almost 100% certain to reject a project if the querier is this young (you're 16 or 17 I assume.) I don't want to inflict my sharkly self on kids. I know you don't think of yourself as a kid, but I do. There's time enough for you to be brutalized by the real world. College for starters.

The complete television series has been packaged together for the first time. Mike’s unpredictable personality moves the narratives in seemingly random directions. Incorporating flashbacks and riveting editing is ambitious for a TV show, but impeccably accomplished. Dillon’s Mike is a fascinating character to watch as is his daughter, Sadie (Laurence Leboeuf), whose role in the show grows as the series continues. The first season hooks viewers with a thrilling murder narrative that doesn’t require any mystery to stay interesting, and the series continues that tradition through two more seasons.
Looking forward to seeing your warranty organization systems. Happy organizing!

Allah (the AllMighty) denied the equality between the believers who sit (at home) and join not in Jihad-and the Mujahidin (those who fight in Allah’s Cause),-Then He mentioned the superiority of the Mujahidin over those (believers) who sit (at home) by a grade and then later on mentioned their (Mudahidin’s) superiority over them (believers who sit at home) by degrees of grades. Ibn Zaid (a religious scholar) said: The degrees of grades with which Allah (swt) preferred the Mujahidin over those (believers) who sit (at home) are seven and these Allah mentioned in His Statement:

I’ve always felt that Wallis enjoyed the attentions of the Prince of Wales, and the social cachet that it gave her to be his intimate friend. I don’t think that she expected initially that he would want to marry her, but when he made it known, she cautiously jumped at the chance. She would be rising higher than any American woman had before or since, not even Consuelo Vanderbilt or Mary Curzon had risen as high. It must have been so tempting. Although in many ways, being a royal mistress was more advantageous than being a royal wife.

Victor Conte is back in the news, as once again we get to hear from the horse’s mouth just how dirty this sport has been and is – in his opinion. Of course Conte’s opinion is considerable if you take into account the fact that he was the chemical mastermind behind the “Cream” (Testosterone cream) and the “Clear” (Tetrahydrogestrinone or THG) – the “undetectable” drugs at the heart of the BALCO scandal of the “oughts” which took down such luminaries as Tim Montgomery, Dwain Chambers, Kellie White, Kevin Toth, Regina Jacobs, and Marion Jones among others.
I always loved the New Year holiday. Not so much the partying on New Year's Eve ( I always, except for one very memorable year, found New Year's Eve to be something of a let down...a time of trying too much to have fun....I guess I like my fun more organic), but the chance to start again, to start fresh. It's the same thrill I get opening a new journal or notebook and thinking about how I'm going to fill it.

On Piano Mal, Sagot alternates between hushed crooning, sinister intonation (in French), and sitting back to let his cinematic instrumental tendencies take over, while his music draws on the darker side of French chanson, spaghetti westerns, art rock, and even white noise soundscapes—"S.O.S.

That you cling to this when your mind is dark and guilt and condemnation are heavy. Focusing on HIM and his truth will bring life. I promise. Will all your problems go away? Certainly not…but your eyes will be lifted. Your perspective will shift…and that is when hope abounds.

I never knew whether I would have children or not. At 34 I was still single, not ever imagining that I would meet a man "in time." Or at least not a man who'd stick around long enough to impregnate me. And I had mostly come to terms with it, but not entirely. Not because I was desperate to be a mom. More because I hate hate HATE more than anything being told what I cannot do. Tell me I can't sing, I will sing every chance I get. Tell me I can't go to Kirsten Silverstein's house after school because her mom lets her smoke pot, that's where you'll find me. Tell me I can't climb Everest--well, I will not climb Everest. But I will resent you and maybe say a few catty things about you behind your back.

Remember that I had been willingly involved in the occult since 16 and had been meditating and doing other occult practices for 14 years. I had been firmly entrenched in the camp of the Fallen One without knowing it. How’s that for deception? You see how subtle it is? The entire time I was in the New Age, I thought I was on the right path toward spirituality and enlightenment; instead, I had opened myself to what the Guidebook to the Supernatural calls the doctrine of demons.

It’s not been the greatest of seasons for Scottish football. However, a few weeks ago a result lit up the gloom like a shooting star across the black November sky. Scotland’s Under 21 team defeated their Dutch counterparts 2-1 in Nijmegen in the Netherlands in a European Championship qualifying tie. It was an unexpected but most welcome result for coach Billy Stark’s side and one that made the rest of Europe sit up and take notice. The scorer of Scotland’s opening goal was striker Jordan Rhodes, who had taken his international bow, albeit briefly, for the senior side three days earlier in the friendly win over Cyprus. Much as I take a fair bit of stick for my advancing years, I like to think I’m not the only one who remembers Jordan’s father Andy keeping goal for Dunfermline Athletic two and more decades ago.

As a movement we don’t hate on all Muslims, we respect their right to practice their religion peacefully as long as it does not infringe on our culture, our way of life, our rule of law and our customs. If any non Muslim was to visit a Muslim country then that person would be expected to respect their rule of law, their culture, their way of life and who would disagree with that? What we don’t agree with are Muslims trying to import a doctrine of hate, intolerance and murder, then try to promote it and institutionalise it through unregulated Mosques that are funded by Wahhabist petro dollars as it stealthily creeps sharia into our legal system. This Islamic legal system persecutes women to the mere status of a man's “property”. It does not recognise marital rape, it does not recognise gay rights, it does not recognise many factors contained in the Universal Declaration Of Human Rights. We have had enough, why should anyone tolerate intolerance?
What about television? For about a year-and-a-half before I first came to India in 1967, I wrote a daily television column for a small-town newspaper in western Canada. I watched a lot of U.S. and Canadian television. There were no Black people on TV. When I came back to North America in 1970, Flip Wilson, an African-American comedian, had a popular TV show. Something dramatic had happened. Thirty-eight years later, the U.S. elected a Black President.

The Catholic Church calls these sins that lead to death, Mortal Sins and the lesser sins that we, ourselves, can pray for forgiveness for, Venial Sin. We have merely given a shorter name to these sins than “sin-that-leads-to-death” and “sin-that-does-not-lead-to-death”.

I have always liked to live cheek by jowl with other life forms. During my city-dwelling years, when the view out the window was more of cars and asphalt than of green things, I had plants on every sill. For a time at work I shared a large office with a colleague, and I made myself a privacy screen out of palms and ficuses and ferns that I lugged one by one from my house to the middle of DC on the metro. When I finished arranging the plants, I was practically invisible behind my green wall, and to find me visitors had to make their way, like tropical explorers, through waving, dripping fronds and bracts and leaves (I kept a spritzer on my desk).

For all the print, tweets and angst, the Red Sox management, team and staff constantly engage with their fans (customers) — open the Park to new uses like hockey games and symphony performances, keep history alive with old scoreboard and those skinny seats, marriage proposals on air, and so on.

One study to show this was led by scientists at the Center for Functionally Integrative Neuroscience at Aarhus University in Denmark.

Meditation makes the gray matter grow.

The other big topic was trauma, and the fact that there is little appreciation for its potentially lifelong impact. One woman pointed out that while there is enormous compassion for our troops suffering from PTSD (as well there should be); but for victims of sexual violence, with a fairly short time frame, they’re constantly receiving messages of, “What do you mean you’re not over it yet?” In this instance, there was agreement that the lifelong impact of trauma yields little understanding, especially in regard to how even the most miniscule events can trigger and episode of anxiety of a bout of depression. Even decades later. “What do you mean you’re still not over it?”

My daughter has a field trip this week and she has to wear a red shirt. I didn't think it was a big deal until I looked in her closet and she owns zero red shirts. I decided to try and make one myself. My husband has a bunch of these red shirts so I started cutting away.

Our guide was Earlene and for two hours she regaled us with her knowledge of Nashville and some semi-vulgar but not terribly vulgar redneck humor.

In the past, we have taken the NashTrash Bus Tour and I can highly recommend that one, too. Check out both websites if you’re planning on a trip to Nashville. The bus trips are funny, affordable and two-hours off your feet in an air-conditioned bus is always welcome on a Tennessee summer day.

But now onto Crater Lake! It was beautiful!!!!!!! This trip was filled with volcanic activity. Crater Lake is actually an ancient volcano the caved in on itself and filled with water. The explosion that created the caldera was one of the largest in the US and it produced an ask cloud that was 15 times larger then Mt. St. Helen's explosion, spreading ash as far as Yellowstone. Its the deepest lake (1949ft) in the US, the 9th deepest in the world, and is known for how blue it is. The rim was so massive and was hard to grasp the sheer magnitude of it's size, and the cliff drops were crazy! There is an island in the middle, Wizard Island, that was formed by recent volcanic activity. I want to go back there sometime and stay at the lodge! It's so cute! And you can hike down the rim and take a boat to Wizard Island and hike to the top! Sounds so fun!!!
Now Jimmy's with a strange looking man in dark glasses. It's not Roy Orbison and it's not the bloke from the Rubettes.
When I started this blog in 2010, I had no idea what I was doing, and I only hoped it would serve as a much needed creative outlet. I remember being shocked when I hit 40 followers, and wondering who those people were and how they found my blog. Today I'm amazed at the friendships this blog has brought in to my life, and still shocked everyday when people stop by to read my ramblings! But I know now that you all found your way to Hi Sugarplum because of other amazing bloggers introducing us. So thank you to everyone who has pimped me out, especially these guys, who are my Top Referrals for 2011.
Several authors and naturalists even pointed out the many benefits of having a connection with nature. Direct contact with nature increases mental health and psychological and spiritual development. The benefits include stress reduction, a sense of order and belonging, improved self-confidence and self-discipline and more conscious awareness of the environment’s rapidly deteriorating condition.
Here’s another from my collection taken at Coombe Abbey. UK
They need a little snap at the end of the pitch to leave you with the thought, "You know, maybe a butt wand really is for me." Something like, "No corn kernel is safe" or "The best thing to happen to your starfish since lube." And that's where you come in, dear readers. Leave your best in the comments section and let's make poop handles the next big thing.

Now two years later, Lifetime is banking again on the popularity of the story and Jennifer Love Hewitt — The Client List is now a series on the television network for women. The names have changed (Samantha Horton is now Riley Parks); the basic plot has been tweaked (the injured husband is now a husband that has abandoned his family); but the general idea remains the same (a mother goes to work as a prostitute to make a living for her children).

It also supports the findings of prior studies that wine has more beneficial effects than any other alcoholic drinks. However, in a twist that always seems to pop up in any study, researchers said that may because the people who choose wine tend to be more naturally healthy anyway. Go figure.
Tennis classes, cricket / soccer coaching, basket ball or swimming lessons- whatever be it, always give your child the thumbs up to play with friends in the field, for everyone can do with some fresh air and exercize! And the next time you plan a family outing, remember to pack your cricket kit or what ever your family fancies.
DCS Williams told the court that the investigation had found “no evidence of a conspiracy at the News of the World.” Mr Sheridan then put it to the witness that he had hardly, ”pursued the News of the World” as the police had “not even interviewed Greg Miskiw.”
On the way to the grocery store is Grandma's Spinning Wheel. My favorite yarn shop. I like Kiwi Knitting, but Grandma has more of a selection of hand dyed yarns. I picked up a second skein of the merino silk that I bought last month to make my sweater. For some strange reason another skein just jumped onto the counter with the one I came to buy. Yarn is sooo sneaky like that. Vouch for me ladies. Duane reads this blog and the comments I get.
I was born at Mt. Zion hospital, in the old wing at Post and Scott, before San Francisco was a "knowledge center" full of "thought leaders," in the dead zone between the counterculture revolutions and the technology boom. They don't have a birth wing any more. It's a cancer research center now. Which you know, I might be grateful for someday too.

The Inuit’s experience in the Arctic is deeply rooted in a sense of homeland, ethnic identity, and the struggle to generate a sustainable livelihood. Aporta’s lecture will explore this connection to the Arctic environment through an analysis of how Inuit, using traditional knowledge, have navigated trails from the Bering Strait to Greenland, developing a sense of pan-Arctic identity.
He massaged my feet, rotated my ankles, kneaded my calves, and slightly slid my legs apart to work on my thighs. OMG! I felt a sensational warm wave go through me. My breasts tingled, my magic button swelled, and my vagina throbbed as the moisture continued to ooze from me. As he massaged the back of my thighs, I thought I would die from embarrassment when I noticed he’d discovered my wetness.

Goldfish has been one of the special little things that Mr. Noodle and I share. When he neatly places a paper napkin on my lap as if it were the finest linen, then reaches under my arm - careful not to jostle as I steer - to shake out a handful of the crackers, I think that no tuxedo'ed waiter in the fanciest white-cloth restaurant could ever serve a finer meal. And when there's only a small handful left in the bag, we know that our next stop - our next adventure - is not far off.
This is what happens during Queens Day:
I haven’t read the chapters now available online, but I understand they’re heavy with the Fae. I hated everything about the way Fairies have been protrayed on True Blood, so I’m hoping that this next-to-last installment of the book series reminds me why they were ever interesting. I want to know why they are congregating at the strip club, what Claude’s ultimate goal is, and of course, how Sookie uses the cluviel dor.
Students in JOMC 457, Advanced Editing, are writing guest posts for this blog this semester. This is the 14th of those posts. Emily Nycum is a reporting major and art history minor.

While the economic meltdown is one reason for this crisis, the more systemic cause is the disappearance of the traditional pension plan. The Week reports that from 1980 to 2006, the percentage of private-sector workers with employer-funded pension plans dropped from 60 percent to 10 percent. The 401(k) plan — voluntary and largely employee-funded — would replace the pension as the primary retirement savings vehicle.
And by that I mean the characters never stop. Society as they know it is crumbling, and for those who were Dauntless, sitting back and waiting to see what happens isn’t an option. Erudite took control of Dauntless to destroy Abnegation. But what of Amity and Candor? Who’s side will they be on? And why did Erudite take control, anyway? Why target Abnegation? What do they want? And what will they do next? Insurgent picks up right where Divergent left off; with Tris, Four, and company on the train, and they have work to do – fight and protect. We find out so much more about all the other factions in this book, and it’s just fascinating. The internal politics of each individual faction, how they work together, how decisions are made, what they base those decisions on, and how others are treated, it’s just brilliantly worked out.
Regulators in Germany accused some utilities of charging customers for more permits than the utilities were entitled to.
I think it will be interesting to see what everyone else's most popular are. Okay, I am being called back to play Awkward Family Photos. This board game is hysterical to play, at least with my inappropriate family!
Most of the children I worked with veered towards the middle or low functioning end of the spectrum. Communication was really difficult for them. This resulted in a lot of frustration on both sides as they tried to figure out ways to express what they wanted and needed while I tried desperately to figure it out. Sometimes we could figure it out together and sometimes the frustration would boil over into a tantrum. Sometimes these tantrums would happen in public.
I first strapped on wooden planks at the age of 9 in Aviemore, Scotland. I don’t remember it in huge detail, just in snapshots: the curling rink, the sheet ice on the White Lady run (a good testing ground for budding ski racers if ever there was one), the wooden T-bar lifts which I only mastered at the end of the few days we were there. I remember laughing with my brother, and the feeling of exhilaration when I finally stayed up on those wretched lifts (mercifully now defunct apart from in the odd eccentric skiing outpost of Austria perhaps).
But here's my first question: does the First Amendment actually protect individuals or groups claiming the right to free speech from private action? The First Amendment was conceived with the intention of protecting the rights of the people against the government. "Congress shall make no law" doesn't just imply that--it states it straight out. So it seems to me that a civil action between Mr. Snyder and the Westboro Baptist Church would not be not be a First Amendment case. That would actually be a pretty good deterrent to the WBC protesters too--you have the right to say what you want at a soldier's funeral, and the soldier's family has the right to sue you for it.
I need to get my second book properly underway, too, so that's NYR #2, and learn Latin. I have a teach yourself book somewhere, NYR #3: locate it and spend half an hour a day on it. I wonder if half an hour's enough?

This new series, which I am calling Southwest Landscapes, was inspired by the September Art Bead Scene challenge entry I created last month. The color palette features some of my favorite tertiary colors: Burnt orange, chocolate, tomato red, denim blue, turquoise, ecru; and more often than not, my favorite faux bone recipes, either showcased on the face or on the back sides of the earrings.

Do any companies reward their employees for superior performance—for mastering a set of tasks? I can’t remember ever working for one that did. Maybe that’s why I appreciate being paid a straight commission now. The more competent and efficient I can become, the higher my compensation should be. No excuses.
Together we will grow.
The vagaries of the market every day just give you ulcers. It is an irrational pricing mechanism that is subject to a long-term upward trend.

It currently remains unclear if the carriages will be fully converted into the comfy Starbucks coffee house design or if they remain in the current design. Further plans for expansions on other rail lines or neighboring countries have not been announced yet.
Oh, mighty Paper Champion, I have dared to write this poor letter to you in gratitude for the recent actions of four of your courageous samurai; Yoritomo Buwa, Daidoji Fujo, Tamori Fubatsu, and Matsu Barbosa. These four warriors were on the way to join your side, when they saved a caravan of the Jolly Crab Trading Company from villainous bandits in the service of the foul Dark Oracle of Fire, and in the process rescued my useless and unworthy life, as well as a young Yasuki caravan guard.
The need for more cooperation for the development and rational use of renewable sources of energy was another point on the agenda. Parliamentarians expressed their commitment to the increase of exchanges and bilateral cooperation in the fields of education, culture, science and sports, as well as their support for regional integration and for the process of constitution and development of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.

Though, for anybody utilizing online dating, they need to think twice about assembly up with somebody they do not know except they feel comfy with them. It’s going to be so vital to take the time to know who someone is chatting with first before any dates are made, even whether it is just friendship somebody is wanting for. Wait till each events are prepared to satisfy up.
I have a confession to make, and this has nothing to do with the fact that you plan to read my book. No ulterior motives.
In San Francisco he lived in North Beach, and associated with artists and bohemians of the Beat Generation. Since childhood he had demonstrated artistic potential. In 1966, inspired by the openness and creativity of San Francisco’s emergent Hippie culture, he began making pictorial collages. Some of these were sold as poster size prints, which were then very popular. He became a prolific artist, concerned with fine technique and with expression of the broadest range of human experience. He intended his art to engage the imagination and counteract the pernicious stimulus-response programming of media advertising.
I rarely make fondue, but only because Mister Man won't eat anything cheese and Little Miss can't eat dairy because of her allergy.

Seems to me that you are an angry bitter woman that needs to move on with her life. I truly feel sorry for you that after this long you have not let go and moved. Instead of focusing on your past and creating a blog about it, you should be looking at your future and all the possibilities. By focusing on the past, writing about your ex and his girl, you are not allowing yourself to move on and be happy. If you think you are getting “even”, which based on your statement about two people being terrified I would say you are trying to, you probably should realize that they most likely could care less what you have to say. If your ex didn’t care enough about you and your marriage when you were married I am pretty sure he doesn’t care now. It’s time to let go and move on.
We carried only water bottles in our packs and donned our kibbutz sun hats along the trail. Dave hailed from Croydon, a London suburb, but had more recently shuttled British trucks through Africa to aid businesses in the apartheid South Africa. I frequently reminded him of his sins, and he made note of mine. It had become customary for Dave and I to argue the finer points of British colonialism as it stacked up against routine American aggression around the globe. He would play his trump card: that the British were the only invaders to burn our Capitol. And I would remind him that we saved their yellow hides to end World War II.
Sunday morning, I spent quietly knitting on the purple sock until Duane got up. He was angry that his Bears that were in London wasn't on TV. Talked to my daughter for an hour on the phone. Then cleaned the bedroom. My neck was cramping after that, so I thought I would take the luxury of an hour nap.

I was lost. Football fans on all sides raged, our excellent meal came and went, and we were even treated to an especially choice version of one of our favorite bar sights (older and very respectable local man enjoying the company of a lady distinctly not his wife, sister, mother, or daughter, although very likely about the age of the last). My eyes stayed glued to the Silent Mystery Karaoke Screen.
Predicting the outcome of football games, especially playoff games, is an exercise in pretending to know the inevitable. Ratings, tendencies, history. They are all considered. And then the hunch weighs in. Proceed.
#16 – Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
One of our wonderful readers who left a comment suggested Our Lady of Perpetual Help. I couldn't agree more. For me, she is the soft place to land when life pushes your to your wits end. You know that saying that God doesn't give you anything you can't handle? I don't believe that. Whoever said that just made up something that sounded good. Life kills people all the time. PTSD, anyone?

Location 3, Clientele 1, Beer Selection 1, Ambience 1, Service 0
Now, I am an emotional person. Maybe it’s the goddamned estrogen runnin’ through me, but I think it’s just my personality. I am a sensitive guy, and when I am upset by something, I get really worked up inside and it’s hard for me to convey my thoughts and arguments clearly. And by clearly I mean not washed out by the feeling of oncoming tears. I managed to say what I needed to, though. I asked if he had a problem with me, and I mentioned about that incident during Coexist. He assured me there that he had no problem with me, that he was only unfamiliar with the name, was all– as nobody had explained it to him previously. Whether this was genuinely what he feels, or not, I’m not entirely sure. I suppose he is sorry, and he doesn’t have a problem with me, but something tells me he’s just not feelin’ the same as he was before.
Lucia asked ‘how are we to sacrifice ourselves?’ The Angel answered: ‘Offer up everything within your power as a sacrifice to the Lord in an act of reparation for the sins by which He is offended; and of supplication for the conversion of sinners. Thus invoke peace upon our country. I am her Guardian Angel; the Angel of Portugal. Above all, accept and bear with submission the sufferings that the Lord may send you.’
Tuesday- Leftovers (I usually do leftovers after a casserole/soup night)
Advertising claims have to be palpably ‘true’, and this is as it should be. In the wider world of reporting and analysing news, truth is inevitably a matter of opinion and perspective: one person’s terrorist is another’s freedom-fighter. But the idea of press freedom comes badly unstuck when tabloid gargoyles who care nothing for freedom, accuracy, society, taste or privacy have no genuine investigatory aim at all. They are in fact far more likely to censor a truth they don’t like, caring only to maximise sales on the back of that day’s 3-in-a-bed romp. In that bed-ridden menage a trois, there is not even a feeble case for the plea of ‘in the public interest’. This is public interest as expressed through the medium of Christians, gladiators, mad bulls and lions in the Colisseum.
The first forty seconds of Nina Simone's "Feeling Good" are probably the best intro in the history of music. I know, I know. Please, bear with me. I'm not someone who is in the habit of handing out superlatives like RSPCA volunteers on the high street giving out flyers informing you that dogs are not just for Christmas. Yet, the way that voice, that voice, breaks through the empty space a capella sends shivers down my spine. There's a steady and progressive build-up, like a bird of prey soaring effortlessly up high in the sky, spotting its future victim and hovering for just one nanosecond before dipping one of its wings and dropping down into the grass to capture its food. That food is you and me, reader: the listeners. Nina's version of Feeling Good is one of those rare moments when I abdicate the use of my mental faculties in favour of a much more raw and emotional rapport. This is the type of art that asks nothing of us, offers no explanations and still manages to hold us captive. The way Nina sings Feeling Good is as if someone were saying: Listen to this song if you want to know what the human voice can do. Enough for me to go down on my knees, place my hands together, lace my fingers and worship it at a temple. Any temple. Even one for atheists.

And what is that you ask? All you need are a pair of outstretched arms (One up , one down) and each hand holding a cup/ mug, one with the the hot liquid of choice. Pour down the coffee from one hand to the other, repeat , being careful not to splash on yourself or anyone else. After a few rythmic swigs back and forth, your coffee has just reached the right amount of froth and the right temperature. Now, you got some very good beverage in your hands! Savor away !

The end result: I did some serious digging on this story, but I found no updates. There have been statements from Phil's lawyers saying that an investigation is warranted because there’s a “shakedown” present, but I've had no updates beyond an interview Phillip did saying that he wasn't gay. Sure you aren't.

Phreak: But the guy has a score of 2/5/4. That’s not bad.
Not all which has been done has been with malevolent intent, I rather placed my credibility on the line by linking the contraceptive pill to genocide in an earlier part of this essay, and I know that, on at least one of the other sites where my earlier articles have been republished, some people who have not done what I asked, and viewed these things in context, have mocked me for it. I do not necessarily believe that, in isolation, the pill was developed or legalised with the deliberate intention of damaging the native European race. However, I submit that it has done so, and as I stated previously, its introduction on the scene coincided with other factors which in combination have been unremittingly negative.
When we eventually got back to the car, we drove nearly all the way back to Orzola to one of my favourite beaches. The rocks go out in two arms to meet a barrier of more rocks about 200 metres out, which prevent the waves reaching the shore. They enclose a huge area of turquoise water only a few feet deep, over a completely clear, sandy bottom. We had a refreshing swim in the warm water, before leaving for home, and the resumption of normal life.
Her brother Tim says the best stories have lots of action. Her father thinks the best stories are the funniest. And Aunt Jane tells her the best stories have to make people cry. A story that does all these things doesn't seem quite right, though, and the one thing the whole family can agree on is that the best story has to be your own.

Back during the “olden” days, women routinely had between 7-13 children and no one thought anything of it because (1) in some cases, it was just more free labor for plantation owners; and (2) because if you lived on a farm out in the middle of Nowheresville, race not considered, there wasn’t much of anything else to do night and day and not much by the way of birth control available. As a matter of information, some women who could not access birth control or proper medical care often died in labor.

The doors to the building are wide open. Around the edge of the circular greenhouse, plants and trees grow in troughs of water or small pools. Dozens of fans positioned around the room serve only to blow the hot air around, so I am already sweating. But that fades from my mind when the crowd around me thins and I see the rest of the room.

The simple truth Captain is that the elites believe, through birth they have a right over all of us. This is hammered into them from an early age, the developing of psychopathy, in order to destroy any compassion and remove conscience. Not only do they think it's their right to own us, but with ownership they also believe they have the right to do whatever they want to with their belongings. They want to kill us. They want to kill 90% of the world's population and bring it down to around 500m people. This is just too difficult to bear for me at times, because who in the fuck do they think they are to think the way they do? Worse still they get away with it, for obvious reasons. You may never have heard of the Georgia guidestones before so if not have a read:
It's a very simple layout, especially when both pennant styles can be punched out with the matching pennant punch (love!).

Well-meaning individuals have said to me–the adoptee, “I could never adopt . . . how do you know what you’re getting? I don’t think I’d like that” I always feel like I’m out of a grab bag when people say that. Actually, I’ve only had two people say that to me. But, it didn’t give me a good feeling; it made me feel like a mutt, and it made me want to defend Naika.

I came home the other day to find that he had found mirrored doors for our bedroom closet that I’ve been wanting. He got them at Habitat for Humanity. He also found a new light for the nursery and has plans to put in stairs by the door to fix the sloping bricks that are slippery. Anyway, after installing the closet doors he completely cleaned the bedroom. He got rid of my tissue collection that was overflowing out of the trashcan, got stuff together for Godwill, vacuumed (including getting rid of the cobwebs and dust on the pictures), put clean sheets on the bed…the room looks great. He has laundry going through all of this and refused to let me help fold it. He told me to sit down and relax. He does all of this on top of working full time and being in the middle of a show.

Over the course of a lifetime maybe we can’t always be at the top of our game. On a football field it is really noticeable but in the council it should still matter. Much like Kevin Pieterson (a comparison I never thought I’d make of myself) being out of form is not something I enjoy.
Above is the effect from DecoArt Weathered Wood. On the left is Annie Sloan Chalk Paint in Paris Grey ($15 for the 100ml sample size) applied over the crackle painted on both horizontally and vertically with a crappy old nylon bristle brush. On the right is the effect with paint over crackle done in one direction. If you leave the crakle to dry until tacky it crackles more. I usually brush paint on over it as soon as they won't blend together. The crazing is more subtle. Be sure to use craft or interior paint; leftover exterior paint resists crackling.

Interestingly, Prince William’s parents Prince Charles and Princess Diana tied the knot almost exactly 30 years ago, on July 29, 1981 at St. Paul’s Cathedral, and the event was broadcast to a global audience of 750 million (Princess Diana’s wedding dress had a train that was 25 feet long!). In contrast, Prince Williams and Miss Middleton will wed at Westminster Abbey. Both the wedding days were declared to be holidays. Hordes of people – around 600,000 to be exact – crowded the streets of London for a glimpse of the royal wedding back then. Whether that number will be matched for the wedding this round remains to be seen.
There are tons of websites devoted to unhappy people having discreet affairs.
"He could not pass the training program for a forensic scientist," said David Alex, administrative chief in the Dallas County district attorney’s office. "The allegations he was lodging were unfounded primarily because he was not even qualified to make those allegations."
There are a couple of lengthy story songs here that I suspect will be the main things most fans will remember about this album. There’s the atmospheric title song, in which Williams relates a number of terrifying descriptions of violence and poverty in a landscape haunted by young thugs hiding hardened faces behind hoods and sunglasses. The background music is a low-key acoustic blues shuffle with Coffey’s electric guitar providing a distant, desperate sounding response.

I am a big believer in the Big D. I am a holy roller. I am a walking billboard. I've been mulling over my fucking Bid D tendencies for years, now, and these two "ah-ha"s = my sister isn't a mystery of biological conundrums and scary adoption issues, she's a person with depressive tendencies. My sister and I have sat across a chasm of a ten year age difference, family dynamics that separate instead of bind, and my fucking emotional blockage. Thank fucking Ganesh that she has spent that time trying to remove obstacles between us because I've never known how to reach out and I'm turning twenty-six and I might deserve her as a sister, now.

While learning about how to paint wood furniture, I learned that you must prime the piece, or it will end up in a disaster. I was planning to prime it separately, but then the guy at Home Depot told me that you can buy paint with primer in it!! So I added the primer to the paint and saved myself an extra step of painting.

In a 10-inch or 12-inch sauté pan, toast pecans in a 350 degrees F., oven (low fan) for 10 minutes. Coat pecans with honey. Once coated, place pan on medium heat and add butter. Lightly sauté pecans, season with salt and pepper, remove from heat. In a mixing bowl, place powdered sugar and hot pecans and stir until evenly coated. Place on a sheet pan and cool. With a knife, chop pecans into smaller pieces.

The main difference in visibility between the Kindle categories and the Books categories is that a customer browsing from their Kindle or app will see only the Kindle catalog and be able to find your book in only those 2 categories. That means if you want the maximum amount of exposure, the Kindle categories you choose need to be dead on. Treat the Book categories as nice-to-haves but not essential. I made this very mistake and talk about it here (under the "Category Tagging" head).
Getting this picture taken was more challenging than any of us imagined. We had originally asked my brother to take the photo and had to cancel every appointment due to scheduling conflicts. Then Matt had his surgery and he was out; meanwhile,we still didn't have our picture. At that point, my hubby volunteered me for the job. Have you ever tried to take a formal picture of a big group and at the same time, had to be in the picture? Needless to say, it was very hard and yet comical at the same time. I set the camera up on a tripod and borrowed my brother's remote, but it wouldn't work from the distance of where we were standing. I ended up setting the timer on the camera and then I would run up a hill and then pose and smile in a ten second time period.
Saturday also marked the last weekend before Eid, the most important festival for Muslims in this region, which falls on Tuesday. Unfortunately, to say the least, the government decided to hold the Presidential Election on such a busy weekend for Muslims. So much for being more understanding.......There were so many Singaporean Muslims who were on duty as election officials who were stucked at the polling station the whole day when they could have spent their precious Saturday preparing for the festival! My husband was one of the officials.... And for him, the election also caused some sleepless nights, planning & coordinating his team ....& that is on top of his regular job!

Somewhere in there I thought the whiskey flavor had tailed off. I added 300ml at kegging originally, so I doubled that and added 600ml. Shortly after, I saw the condensation line at about halfway down the keg. It meant I added double the whiskey to half the batch - 4 times the original addition. It took a bit for the whiskey to come down, but it was very well received at a band practice night in March.
For starters, the characters were shrill, one-dimensional and annoying. There was so much screaming and shrieking, I had to hold my finger poised over the volume control lest I blow out my TV's speakers and my ear drums simultaneously. The fact that these paper-thin characters continued to film everything was even harder to swallow here than in most movies of the same ilk. You know when most people stop recording? When they're climbing over severed, flaming appendages to get themselves to (relative) safety.
Also to my eyes, neither of the monsters in this tale are realized as well as they could’ve been, due mostly to ill fitting tights. Bok, the stone gargoyle come-to-life, is cuter than he is threatening, and Azal is one of those great examples of how much more effective it is to not see the goods. “The Daemons” does such a fantastic job of teasing the viewer as to Azal’s appearance, that it almost has to be a letdown when he’s finally shown. It sort of is (seriously – keep an eye out for the tights), and the less said about Stephen Thorne’s booming, one note performance as the beast, the better. (This is the same guy who played Omega in

Ottawa's two third period goals did little to diminish Henrik Lundqvist's stellar effort tonight. Although the two goals did tarnish it a bit. On Alfredsson's goal, Henrik had absolutely no defensive help. The second goal, well, it was scored off a hell of an angle. There's no taking away however, Henrik was huge. He faced thiry-two shots and turned back thirty.

This was a day in which I wanted to do something particular but couldn't. Today is an old friend's birthday. I haven't talked with her in several years. So my plan for today was to surprise her with a phone call. Due to some frustrating problems with our phone, I had to wait until 9:00pm to call her, but then ended up not being able to do it due to family needs.
The trouble is, I then noted, that we have cut ourselves off from the hill tribes. They are now in Pakistan ... except that they come of the hills raiding and looking for work. But it is rather remarkable that we are prepared to hire Nepalese and use them but not raise native regiments, drawing them down from the hills with bribes and offers of work.

However, genuine free-houses are becoming few and far between, with the more successful of them being snapped up by larger regional firms such as Fullers, Greene King and Shepherd Neame. Even those still in private hands are often effectively tied, by way of loan agreements, to taking beer from the likes of the aforementioned. Although many will feature a "must stock" beer such as Harveys (nothing wrong with Harveys I hasten to add!), this leaves precious room on the bar for beers from our budding local entrepreneurs. Some of these firms will undoubtedly strike lucky and find a more or less permanent place on the bar for at least one of their beers. Others may find free-trade outlets taking their wares on a rotating basis with products from one or more of their competitors. Nothing wrong with that either; I am all in favour of competition, so long as it's fair, and from the drinker's point of view there's nothing better than being offered a wider choice of beers.
And I will admit… I also post stuff when with friends. But not while in conversation and all. I get annoyed BIG time when friends come over to you (or vise versa) and their social apps are demanding most of their time. Of course there are always exceptions. But I do think it is much better to spend good quality time with friends and…later on when they are gone…then post all about it. You’re able to thank them for everything and while they were with you, you could actually talk instead of Tweet/Whapsapp to each other…
The shofar is the ram’s horn traditionally blown the month prior to and during the Jewish High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. The sounding of the shofar is intended to wake-up the soul and to call the community to worship. During the workshop portion, David explains how to choose the best shofar to suit each person’s needs and how to play a shofar, including the shofar calls for the High Holy Days, advanced musical techniques and unique shofar sounds. Those attending are encouraged to bring their own shofar to participate.
With that, brings me to the title of this post. What a Weekend! This weekend will be fun and probably pure chaos. This year, with our budget, we could not afford to do a big birthday and a big gift, both. So we gave Bubbs the choice of choosing one or the other. Let me clarify "big". A big party is what we have done just about every year. He always invites his whole class, plus other friends and family and we book a party somewhere, like at a skating rink, play palace, or something like that. It costs easily a couple hundred or more just for the party. For the "big" present, now that he is a little older, he wants cool gadgets, electronics, and video game systems for gifts. So we try to get him one big present and a few smaller ticket gifts.

The thing is people we all live together in this world, why do we feel the need to steal from others who make a little more? Why do we feel the need to cut others down because they are “different” from you? Why? Why? Why? We are just really hurting ourselves the way we hurt others. By stealing you hurt your community, by killing you hurt the population, by bullying people, you make the world bitter. Why would you want to do that?

But there were still many doubters, both within the Star Trek family and outside, who were terrified that revising such a truly iconic series in a similar way could destroy it forever. In the minds of many of the fans, Star Trek was never about snazzy visuals; it was about stories and characters. The sparsely used fx and blurry but colourful planets matched with the balsa-wood sets and polystyrene rocks, all of which had never stood in the way of the series’ success over the decades.

So many challenges. So many things to get through just to live. It’s getting very tiring. I don’t know if I can make it. Could I? As years pass, I am growing older. I am growing weaker.

However, in a recent as yet unpublished case from the Court of Appeals for Kentucky, K.H. v Cabinet, issued on December 22, 2011, the Cabinet has run into a limit on their power. In my opinion, this is a very important case and places an essential limit on the Cabinet to insure that parent’s rights are protected while not impairing protections for vulnerable children.
Gladstone was not quite the last Liberal to represent Greenwich. Greenwich returned a Conservative MP for the next 26 years but in the great 1906 Liberal election victory Richard Jackson was returned as Liberal member for Greenwich. He served only one term however, and most of the time since the seat has been either Labour and Conservative, apart from the SDP interlude (http://greenwichlib.wordpress.com/2012/03/03/you-never-promised-me-a-rose-garden/).
And something fragile as a prayer, starts breaking me apart.
When O’Sullivan made most of his photographs, roughly 1863 to 1885, little was known about the western territory of the United States. When he was asked by the U.S. government to do a geographic survey of the fortieth parallel, O’Sullivan had little need for his imagination – the scenes in front of him were grand enough, rough enough, and spectacular enough to be interesting. O’Sullivan did not need to make a painting or to compose spiritually weighted scenes like Ansel Adams would later do of the west. O’Sullivan simply needed to record. Furthermore, that was the constraints of the U.S. survey; it was what O’Sullivan was being paid to do.

Whatever He prayed for us, it must have been awfully important in His mind for Him to take time to pray about it when He’s about to die. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if it is central to what the Church needs. Here’s what He said:
At the time of her maiden voyage she was the largest ship afloat. One of three Olympicclass ocean liners operated by the White Star Line, she was built between 1909–1911 by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. She carried over 2,200 people – 1,316 passengers and about 900 crew. Her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, such as millionnaires John Jacob Astor IV, Benjamin Guggenheim and Isidor Strauss, as well as over a thousand emigrants fromIreland, Scandinavia and elsewhere seeking a new life in America. Designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury, the Titanic had an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. She also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use.

Everything was fine......until.... ha. Around 1am Jesse Ava woke up screaming. I met her on the stairs and found that her left side (hair, face & pj shirt) was covered in yucky ear goop. Also, she had thrown up in her bed. I knew from experience, that her ear drum had busted. Her's has busted 3 times now within about 2 years. She was in a lot of pain. I could not get her to calm down. High fever, screaming, squirming...for about an hour and a half. I gave up. I took her to the ER. They got us in so very quickly and were amazing with her. Our doc was so great with kids! He drew her pictures, printed out Disney pictures and they gave her princess crayons. -All while she screamed away.

We also honour thy love of Jesus, O thou that art called the brother of the Lord, on whose venerable features was stamped the likeness of our Redeemer. If, like the rest of the Apostles, thou didst abandon him in his Passion, thy repentance was speedy and earnest, for thou wast the first, after Peter, to whom he appeared after his Resurrection. We affectionately congratulate thee, O James, for the honour thus conferred upon thee; do thou, in return, obtain for us that we may taste and see how sweet is our Risen Lord. Thy ambition was to give him every possible proof of thy gratitude; and the last testimony thou didst bear, in the faithless city, to the divinity of thy dear Master (when the Jews took thee to the top of the Temple) opened to thee, by martyrdom, the way that was to unite thee to him for eternity. Pray for us, O thou generous Apostle, that we also may confess his holy Name with the firmness which befits his disciples; and that we may ever be brave and loyal in proclaiming his rights as King over all creatures.

That was a crazy part of my day but it doesn't end there 2pm rolls around and I'm gathering up my stuff to head to Sioux Falls. Karen is informing me I will be delivering a Bunny to a friend in SF who left it behind. Yep a bunny so Karen took me to my 150,000 pound semi and I said some truckers have dogs not me I got a bunny. Pretty bad ass. I put all my bags and bunny in cab short on space but every thing fit. I fired it up and do my inspection. But I noticed an air leak figured where it was coming from and immediately see some one cut the line my heart just sunk because I knew they did something to the machine on the trailer. Sure as shit they cut electrical lines all over. The reason I knew they hit the machine is because it happened 2 other times and my wonderful boss made it seem like it was my fault. So all these thoughts are going through my head of how do I explain this, I told Karen they will probably fire me over this. I just couldn't believe it. Man I was all flustered. It was any where from $20,000 to $40,000 worth of damage. A cop showed up and took pictures asked questions. He ask if I might know who would do this I told him it is more than likely our competition but couldn't be certain. I got the trailer in good enough shape to make it to our shop in Spearfish went to call in an oversize permit and while on the phone with the permit guy he says "Oh crap we just got hit by lightening can you call back in ten minutes". Unreal right, well i got the permit and notified our lead guy in Spearfish who earlier said you don't have to cross a scale but I reminded him that sometime they do a truck check at a rest area on the way. Yep sure enough there it was I pulled in and he ask for my permit i gave it to him and told my story of the day. He let me go saying sounds like you have enough to deal with.

There is something to be gained from the consistency and predictability of daffodils, a sense of comfort that they will grow no matter what happens. Arts organizations do differ from daffodils in a significant way; we are constantly reliant on the generosity and patronage of others to make the work we do possible.

This ad was particularly remarkable because Rakofsky is not licensed to practice in New York and he had never tried a case before the mistrial. It bears noting that a young lawyer was disciplined in South Carolina for a website that contained “material misrepresentations of fact and omissions of facts necessary to make the statements considered as a whole not materially misleading by mischaracterizing respondent’s legal skills and prior successes; falsely stating he handled matters in federal court; falsely stating he graduated from law school in 2005; and, listing approximately 50 practice areas in which he had little or no experience.”

Certain alcohol-related cognitive impairment is reversible with abstinence (17). Newly detoxified adult alcoholics often exhibit mild yet significant deficits in some cognitive abilities, especially problem-solving, short-term memory, and visuospatial abilities (18). By remaining abstinent, however, the recovering alcoholic will continue to recover brain function over a period of several months to 1 year (19)-with improvements in working memory, visuospatial functioning, and attention-accompanied by significant increases in brain volume, compared with treated alcoholics who have subsequently relapsed to drinking (18).

Estimate? $1500 (turned out to be slightly more). THEN, on Saturday I awoke with a start at exactly 6:30 a.m. to an enormous crash! I ran all over the house, checking on the girls, and probably unconsciously NOT checking on my son for fear that something had happened to him. Then, another big crash and up to his room I went and called to him to see if he was ok. Well, the crashes were a large portion of his ceiling falling in! Once we pay for the ceiling demo, drywall, and repainting the room, we are in excess of $1300. So, the triumvirate complete, and we’re out-of-pocket a small fortune.
Obviously, I need to work on shalom bayit. And looking at the list of middot I have a long way to go to righteousness, or maybe in some case, to even reasonableness. ”Peace comes with work… including mastering a number of other middot” (More from Susan Freeman’s Teaching Jewish Virtues) that I will undoubtedly be visiting in my journey:
Those who followed the case closely already knew this was Nifong’s party line—the N&O’s Ben Niolet had revealed it in a devastating profile of the district attorney. (The item was one of dozens of facts N&O broke about the case. The total number of accurate Herald-Sun scoops? One, coming in mid-November and regarding the accuser's one-time supervisor at the strip club, Yolanda Haynes. Editor Bob Ashley complained, mysteriously, that the paper lacked good sources on the case.) But few in the national media, it appeared, read the N&O, and Nifong’s admission was major news.
Some aspies describe the meltdown as a red or grey band across the eyes. I've certainly experienced this. There is a loss of control and a feeling of being a powerless observer outside the body. This can be dangerous as the aspie may strike out, particularly if the instigator is nearby or if they are taunted during a meltdown.
I'd been wanting to do a fun work-wear post for a while now, so when I was approached by SNOBSWAP, I decided it was the right time. Some of you don't hold office jobs with strict dress codes, so you have a lot more creative leeway when it comes to how you dress during your work week. (Note that if you fall into this category, I will automatically stew silently at you from a distance). A lot of you, however, have to trek to the office, to the courtroom (ESQ's?), to boardrooms, and through corporate America's meetings, all the while, looking professional and polished...hopefully.
“It is arguable whether RSPO could in the future provide a forum to increase legal compliance, social responsibility, environmental responsibility and sustainability of the palm oil industry. However at the moment RSPO membership has no significance on the behavior of a company,” he said.
So yeah, you won’t identify with these characters. My students won’t show up in the fall telling me “I am sooo like Shoshanna!” the way they did ten years ago with Miranda, Carrie, Samantha and Charlotte. (There’s even a nice scene in the first episode in which Shoshanna burbles about which character she identifies with.) These girls haven’t figured out what they want, nor how to get it. They’re full of borrowed, would-be sage advice picked up here and there — and they’re quick to criticize each other — but they’re floundering. It’s kind of amazing.

It was actually a fox that brought us together – her thief lord character whose name, in his language, means “fox”. I read Tirzah’s description of him in one of the many NaNo forums; he intrigued me (foxes? Thieves? Let me in on it!), and I contacted Tirzah to tell her so.

*ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is the principal investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Its primary mission is to promote homeland security and public safety through the criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration. Simply put, ICE goes after illegal immigrants in US territory, employers who hire illegal immigrants, and those trying to smuggle goods or contraband into the country.

I also decided I had waited long enough to purchase a copy of A Life in Pictures, his “Autopictography”. This is a beautifully produced book (as his always are), with great care taken over images, text and layout. He uses images of his own work, and those that inspired him, to tell the tale of his life and loves, his trials and tribulations, his dreams and desires. It gives an interesting insight into his creative pre-occupations and process, revealing a restless imagination at work.

On this day, the sleigh he pulled was loaded with taps and some drills. Up to three taps per tree would be inserted once the holes had been drilled. I spent the day playing with the goofy dogs, stroking the horse, his coarse hair making my hands grubby and also making a nuisance of myself. I would alternate between standing back and observing the work taking place while chattering away and getting way too close while the taps were pounded into the trees. Eventually the sugar plump fairy pulled me aside.

But if we were to intervene in Iran, or the Falklands, or Syria, or anywhere else (and political leaders like military intervention as cheering on the troops stops us thinking about the things that are going on right under our noses) surely, surely, the troops will need uniforms.

I’ve had a few changes in my life this fall, and most of them are good, or at least potentially good. We just finished painting the exterior of our house; I’ve started some new projects at work; I’ve got some new yarns and several WIPs (works in progress); and the Big Guy has bought me a new (to me) bike. So I should be feeling a lot happier than I do; but I’m still grieving for a very special member of my family.
Email relay is, quite simple, a feature that allows one email server to use another email server for sending mail. In a relay setup, one SMTP server is configured to relay all the mail it’s trying to send through another email server when the sending email address is not a part of the second server’s organization. In a relay situation, Server 1 will connect to Server 2 and attempt to send an email using SMTP. However, unlike a normal SMTP session where Server 1 sets the recipient as an email address that “belongs” to Server 2, Server 1 tries to send an email to a recipient in a completely different organization. A successful relay basically means that Server 1 can use Server 2, which accepts email for company1.com, to send email to Company2.com.

They are also ‘in the loop’ of believing in a conspiracy and there is nothing you can say or do which will change their mind. Any evidence which supports their theory – supports their theory, and any evidence which doesn’t support their theory, was just planted there to cover up the conspiracy, and proves the conspiracy even more.
I don’t talk a lot about the specific things that have happened like this, because the truth is that it won’t make a whole lot of difference for people who don’t believe, I don’t think. They’ll just think either that I’m making it up, or that I’m crazy or something. But for me, when I specifically have God answer things, like this…even to a degree that I’m in no way expecting or asking for…it’s just further evidence that He’s real…and not only that, but that He cares enough about His children to even take the time to do something like this for them.

“Faith can never be presupposed, because every generation needs to receive this gift through the proclamation of the Gospel and to know the truth that Christ has revealed to us. The Church, therefore, is always engaged in proposing to all the deposit of the faith; contained in it also is the doctrine on the Eucharist — central mystery in which “is enclosed all the spiritual good of the Church, namely, Christ himself, our Pasch” — doctrine that today, unfortunately, is not sufficiently understood in its profound value and in its relevance for the existence of believers. Because of this, it is important that a more profound knowledge of the mystery of the Body and Blood of the Lord be seen as an exigency of the different communities of our diocese of Rome. At the same time, in the missionary spirit that we wish to nourish, it is necessary to spread the commitment to proclaim such Eucharistic faith, so that every man will encounter Jesus Christ who has revealed the “close” God, friend of humanity, and to witness it with an eloquent life of charity.
Even after losing weight, even after working out on average 2-4 days a week for the last several years, in my mind I’m still the fat girl who everyone is watching “suck wind”. Sure, I’m competitive, but I’m not athletic. Sure, give me bench-presses or leg-presses . . . anything weight related . . . and I can throw down with the best of them. I mean, after all, at some point those muscles had to lug around over 300 pounds and are still lugging around over 200 pounds, but, if you ask me to run, I still can’t get over this mindset that I am not a runner. However, today, something clicked. As I was jogging on the treadmill and working out on the elliptical . . . all the sudden I heard her. I heard the athlete inside of me just

Eaton was a Coventry music scene mover and shaker and one of the original DJ's at the popular Hand & Heart venue in the city which played host to the emerging Coventry punk scene in the late 70's. The club also played an important role in launching many of the early embryonic versions of early 2-Tone bands. According to Coventry music historian Pete Chambers, reggae band Hardtop 22 played at the club and a few months later key members of the band would form the core of The Selecter. On February 23, 1978, a band called the Coventry Automatics played the venue and on Friday December 1, 1978, they returned as The Specials.

Last bottled beer of 2008: Abita Jockamo IPA, at Hamilton Tavern on Harford Road, a half-hour after the previous beer. $2 a bottle, I'm writing about cheap beer for Mid-Atlantic Brewing News, and I had no idea Louisiana had a damned clue what an IPA was. Not bad. Not terrific, but definitely drinkable.

It is not permissible to shave a part of the head and leave a part, as this was prohibited by the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) as reported by al-Bukhari. The strongest view seems to be that the head of the boy or the girl should be shaved, as is reported that Fatimah weighed the hair of her daughter (Muwatta) but the scholars differ o­n this, and Allah knows best.
Now, my last post was about my love of old hymns, more specifically I reposted a montage of old hymns and their lyrics as they display the Gospel message. The reason I love old hymns and the reason I love Secret Church are one in the same. They both speak concentrated truth that penetrates my mind and soul. There is something unique about the eloquence and unabashed lyrics in old hymns just as there is something unique about uniting with 50,000 people in 70 countries to learn together, pray for the persecuted Church, and worship God by devoting ourselves to His Word.
He yelled. I yelled in defense. We went our separate ways. He wouldn't let it go. He came back again and again with the fight. He dragged the kids into it. He treated me with disdain. He mocked me. He contradicted my parenting choices with the kids. He blew off commitments. Everything in his approach with me that night said, "Screw you. You're worthless anyway."

Fifthly, there was the utterly ridiculous row about gerry cans. It seems to me that the Gov't was absolutely right to advise motorists to fill their tanks, and while I'm sure the word gerrycans (which is somehow amusing) would have been better not used, the overreaction of the public was just that - an over reaction. Unite were contemplating a tanker driver's strike, and its the responsibility of Gov't to prepare for it. Just imagine the media response if there had been a strike, and Gov't had just sat back like a rabbit in headlights - afraid to move in case...

I denounced some people who said that the Jews are the offspring of apes and pigs. That’s not true. When God transformed some people into apes and pigs, they did not have any offspring, as is written in the Al-Muslim compilation. When God transforms people into something else, they do not have offspring. They die and are annihilated straight away. Besides, this is a curse, and Islam forbids cursing.

Actually, lemme quickly address on bit. His drawdown of troops in Afghanistan will be popular. And pretty much unassailable. People are tired of the war. And no Republican can really make much of an argument against it, without the obvious counter tat Bush and the GOP had 8 years to fight the war. How much of that is itself countered by blowback against what many people see as unseemly posturing over his “gutsy call” remains to be seen.
