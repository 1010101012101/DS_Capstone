Do blogs need introductory posts or do you just wade straight in and start floundering around, not like a flounder (possibly the stillest creature in the marine kingdom) at all, but like a juvenile okapi, thrashing helplessly in a particularly deep section of the Congo with your preposterously inadequate Bambi legs and a look of desperation on your face that quickly turns to a look of resignation before sinking, with the rest of your head, below the cool sheet of water which only moments ago you were lapping at contentedly?

Write down. You will find that a garden log or journal will be very helpful next spring when you’re trying to identify those first tentative green shoots and wondering whether you divided that Hosta plant last fall or should you do it now. Draw a basic diagram of each bed, noting the plants and adding photos where you can. A little extra effort with your journal will pay off next spring.

It is a quiet time to reflect on my life and the life of the woman who brought me into this world. This year is a significant year for me. My mother died at age twenty nine. This year I turned twenty nine...
I logged on to the blog dashboard this morning to approve comments and noticed several hundred views of an article I posted back in 2008 on the California-based Vagos Motorcycle Club. As I made my way to the Google reader I learned that some 30+ members of the Vagos, also known as the “Green Nation” were arrested Saint Patrick’s Day in a multistate police raid.

Until recently we’ve only been able to speculate about story’s persuasive effects. But over the last several decades psychology has begun a serious study of how story affects the human mind. Results repeatedly show that our attitudes, fears, hopes, and values are strongly influenced by story. In fact, fiction seems to be more effective at changing beliefs than writing that is specifically designed to persuade through argument and evidence.

When you have your front and back pieces cut out, you should notice that they are just slightly different. See how the back waistband is an inch or so higher than the front. That's to account for the baby's bum and nappy. If you're using cloth nappies like I am then you'll want to make sure you have the rise high enough to go over the nappy.

That's right. About the only non-megaswill beer I would get on a bottle is Guiness. And it actually tastes better in my opinion out of the bottle. Heineken is always available, but we all know how those green bottles let in light, and thus oxidation and funk. And again, you don't know how long that Heiney has been sitting in that fridge. Guiness comes in a black bottle, so it works out great with longevity. Not to mention that it will make you look a touch more sophisticated to the ladies if you're drinking the big G than Bud. Go figure.
Besides, I like to spoil my birdies as I am sure you know.
VG: I quoted statistics from VIDA. Whether there is a conscious bias, I do not know, but the figures show an imbalance. Perhaps I am guity of an imbalance as well. On the plane journeys to and from Athens, I read two books: ‘The Fall’ by William Golding, and a biography of Ernast Shackleton. I then wrote some of my own novel - so was engaged in my own work - as a woman writer. Does that redress the situation? Probably not. My main characters are males. Oh dear. But I would hope we never have a situation where writers are told what they must write - there lie dragons!

It remains unclear how Ottawa intends to ensure it meets its constitutional mandate to fully consult with first nations and to accommodate their concerns about resources projects. British Columbia Indian bands have vowed a court challenge to the anticipated federal approval of the Gateway pipeline project, arguing the current hearings are a sham because the Harper government is determined to proceed. In the budget, the government said it would “enhance consultations” with aboriginal peoples. Ottawa also plans to centralize all environmental oversight in three agencies, rather than the 40 departments and agencies that can now have a say before any major project is approved. …
This was followed almost immediately by a crack of thunder like the world was splitting in half, and the house shook tremendously for a period of at least fifteen seconds. The roar of thunder slowly spread out across the sky, rolling away through the rain-soaked heavens, reminding others that the fury was just coming toward them and they, too, had better be ready to receive word from above.

I have a quick flick through my recent scripts. The latest is the thing I'm doing for BBC4 is this 18th century adaptation, filled with whores*, booze and slapstick (mainly comprised of the protagonist falling over whilst in the middle of booze). It is wildly unsuitable. But it is also, I reckon, quite funny. And half an hour long.
February 10th after work and school, Sugar Bear went and had a date with her Aunt Amy, while I went out with some friends for a friend's birthday. We had a yummy dinner that ended with this delicious cheese cake. Oh my, how I love cheesecake. Sugar had a good time as well. They went to the pottery place, and painted a Valentine surprise for me, then went out to dinner. They had never had a one on one date before, so it was really special.

Climb.
As soon as I saw this bike, I envisioned creating a flat black beauty with a retro feel to it, and I believe I've successfully accomplished what I set out to do. There's a few odds and ends I still plan on tweaking or replacing, and first on the list is tires. Seeing as they're 32 years old.. they don't quite hug the road as good as they should. It's not that the treads are worn.. the rubber simply has lost most of its pliability after three decades. By the looks of the bike when I found her, it appeared that she spent most of her life out in the elements.

I have been so touched by people that I started to sketch them (while I had never sketched anyone before). I didn’t choose the one most appealing, I chose the one close to me, easiest to watch for a few minutes. This led me to look at them in even more details, and because I spent some minutes watching them carefully to catch what was significant abouth their traits, they became less strangers to me and days later I can still remember them.
Along the way, I noticed it was pretty hazy to the south, so there were no expansive views to be had today. There was the mysterious sound of bagpipes, however. I couldn't figure out where they were coming from, either there was a troop of bagpipes not too far away, or someone in town had their stereo set at ear-blasting volume. I'm pretty sure it was the former.

The new and compelling novel ‘Wasted’, written by Scottish author Nicola Morgan, leaves little to be desired as it combines philosophical dilemmas and romantic wonder in the threatening backdrop of a teenager’s life. As if this isn’t enough there is the daring aspect of Jack’s game, where risk is taken and the consequences must be dealt with no matter what they may be.

Story reading many tools from saws to drills were used to kill these defenseless animals is sickening. Sometimes it is hardening to comprehend the difference between humans and animals, but these sorts of stories and those especially from those who have pets would hardly make a distinction between the two.

Yes. I know. First the iron, now this. I should see a therapist. Seriously though, Oh My God, my life has been changed by a microplane grater. This one in fact.

I want to put zest in EVERYTHING now.

So why is the group at loggerheads with NAMA? NAMA, it seems, is going to put the property up for auction, but the group had hoped that they could have bought it directly. NAMA says that it must secure the best possible price for the property whereas the group says that NAMA should be supporting the economic and social development of the area. Implicit in all of this is the assumption that NAMA thinks it can get a better price for the property at auction or is sufficiently concerned that it may not be getting the best price from the community group.

Place the butter and olive oil in a skillet and heat on a medium setting. When the pan is hot, place several of the crab cakes in the pan. Fry the crab cakes for at least 4 minutes per side, or until the crab cake is seared on both sides. Depending upon the size of crab cakes, this recipe should yield about 10 crab cakes.

I’m all for companies trying to make money and, hell, if any and all of these things were slowly integrated into the game I would probably be a willing participant because I’ve had time to determine whether I love it or hate it but, throwing all of this at you before launch even begins? It makes you wonder about the game as a whole. Is Funcom too confident or not confident at all in their product? Double dipping makes me wonder how Funcom imagines to sustain their game. Even now, one of the comments in the linked article stands out – it’s set up for f2p right from the get go should something fail.
A new report by Nielsen Co., released Friday, underscores what network television researchers have been preaching for more than a year: that “second screen viewing” appears to augment the TV viewing experience rather than steal away viewers.
The desserts bring back memories of church potluck suppers and the good old days when we'd drive to relatives farms for weekend get-togethers, and I was happy to hear that all desserts are made in-house except for some that are made by an elderly couple with recipes used out of an old church cookbook -- like the butter tarts. The cinnamon buns could very possibly take home the gold medal if they were ever entered in a contest.

Can I take this opportunity to apologise for the miseryfest this blog has become over the last few posts? It has been a very bleak time indeed. This time last week I had 12 birds, and now I'm down to 8. Losing Hoppy and then Doris has been a massive blow. Hoppy more than likely had a genetic issue, and Doris either had egg peritonitis or a liver tumour. Either way, there was no fixing her. She will be missed, but I take comfort from the fact that she had three good years with us, and ate a hell of a lot of treats. She also shrieked her distinctive baby seagull song loud and long. The entire neighbourhood knew about Doris.
James V. Allred was Governor at the time of the Texas Centennial, and his youngest son, future cabaret performer Sam Houston Allred, was born in the Sam Houston Room in Sam Houston’s bed, in 1937. Local readers should take note that this Sam Allred is not to be confused with his cousin Sammy Allred, radio personality, Geezinslaw Brother, pitchman extraordinaire, and local folk hero. Anyway, I think Sammy’s middle name is “Norris.”
So please bear with me as I shake off the rust and try to re-learn some of the nuances of posting items that are worth reading on the old Intrawebs. Things have probably changed a little since I last poked my head in here, so I'll take a bit of time to get used to things and re-introduce myself to many of the people that got me hooked in the first place.
Note: If the headphone jack on your audio interface is hardwired to a particular pair of outputs, such as 1 and 2, it is a good idea to use this as the Pre-Listening output. Otherwise you will need an adapter to merge the left and right outputs to a stereo headphone connector.
It was also blatantly filmed in America. Now I live about 10 miles away from St. Andrews, and I can honestly tell you that St. Andrews looks absolutely nothing like that. But then, I don’t think attention to detail was of paramount importance to the producers of this film, what-with Kate breaking into an American accent (apparently the girl – who has starred in such classics as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies – is British, but she’s clearly lived in the US long enough for her accent to have changed a bit), William wearing a US Air-force uniform rather than a Royal Air-force one, and St. Andrews University being called ‘St. Andrews College’.

But during my early teen years my cousin and I—back in the day before the internet (yes, I am that old)—would exchange scripts we’d written of a popular TV show. No, I won’t tell you which TV show because then you’d know how old I really am. But it was a western with two gorgeous cowboy heroes and we were each in love with one of the main characters. I’d say that was my first foray into writing, and it got me hooked.

Unfortunately, it is a most suitable beginning for a theory that has gone on to become one of the longest-running social scares of all time. Since its inception, the IPGC – composed of thousands of scientists from around the globe who allegedly represent the unbiased “consensus” on gravity – has used the theory of gravity to keep people the world over in a state of constant fear of falling to the ground. Even where people have learned to take courage and go about their daily lives without cowering in the shadow of the gravity scare, flawed research has been used to inflate fears that gravitational attraction might cause an asteroid or other celestial object to collide with the Earth (some have proposed that such an event wiped out the dinosaurs, an obviously ridiculous claim given the fact that dinosaur bones, even if they weren’t placed in the earth by Satan in order to fool people into believing the earth is older than its roughly six thousand years, are clearly the remains of creatures drowned in the Old Testament flood). Through manipulating this fear and working with policymakers to exploit the public, scientists have appropriated countless millions to purportedly investigate this non-existent problem and forward their insidious agenda of social control. LIGO merely represents the latest product of this corrupt system.
I taught myself to cook from scratch and through gardening I came to understand the seasons. I realised that if I bought in season food was cheaper, and so started to plan what I ate, around what was growing, what I could buy in season and what I had been able to preserve.

My journey continued with self-pity, which slowly gave way to self-reflection. Pain and uncertainty, especially of the medical kind, has the direct effect of forcing an individual to realize what is important. Sitting in an x-ray room, you don’t want to die. Waiting for a biopsy result you make promises to God, to yourself. There are things in life more important than comfort and ego, I realized. Bigger things than pop culture and sports blogs. These are lessons I keep telling myself.

So why not try some sources of fibre if you don’t eat it often? It is always advisable to increase the amount you eat slowly, particularly if you are not used to eating large amounts. Start by including one more portion of fruit (about a handful) or vegetables (2-3 tablespoons or a small salad) per day, till you are eating recommended levels or start with a bowl of wholegrain cereal (30g,) then include wholegrain breads, oats, wholegrain pasta/rice – increase by one item per day and see how tasty it is!

I wanted to end with a video of one of my readings. Many nights are rather low tech though, so there aren't that many. These ones were recorded in my study and you'll see they were done before I'd learned the poems properly so there are glances at the page rather than the usual recital. On the other hand, the words are suitable for most audiences so I feel comfortable putting them up here. There are videos out there of several of my readings, at the Poetry Cafe in Covent Garden, Grit Lit in Brighton, Literary Death Match. The same can't necessarily (!) be said for those but, um, I believe the saying is "google is your friend" if you want to hear some of the other stuff!!

I have long wondered what pickled eggs taste like, but never had the courage to try one. They only really appear in old man’s pubs and the hygiene standards of such establishments are often an indication that eating anything is playing Russian roulette with your health. I saw these and knew I had to try a pickled egg once in my life. I like eggs. Fried, boiled, scrambled. Very nice. I like dipping soldiers (toasted bread cut into strips) into a soft boiled egg. I’m usually not one for pickles though. I can handle red cabbage, branston pickle & sauerkraut but onions, beetroot and gherkins, nooo thank you.

sofia vergara. modern family is one of my fave shows; i love all of the characters. but frankly, if i swung this way...omg. she is my girl crush. i wish i had her body.
The people fed.gov has granted themselves permission to monitor are considered a threat to their power and fed.gov's (assumed) monopoly on the narrative. This recalls Donald Sensing's post I linked to Monday, "The Left's Only Question: Who is to Rule, That is All" As GardenSERF commented yesterday,
There is no indication that many, if any of Jesus’ family followed him in ministry. We catch glimpses of his mother Mary from time to time, but it wasn’t until after his death that we see his brothers mentioned in Scripture. One became a church leader inJerusalem. Others were missionaries. His patience with family eventually paid off.
There is a shortage of Foster carers and it is estimated that another 8-9,000 more are needed across the UK. There are more children coming into care. This year there were 10,000 more applicants for children going into care ,teenagers will be a portion of that.
We were in a hurry, catching up with close friends for dinner in Long Island. It was late evening and the light was fading quickly. But after we'd parked and were on our way to the restaurant (Smokin Al's, a rib joint) I noticed this mural on a wall.

With his bar, his theatre, and me, his audience, I was impressed by Peters ability to run the floor, create complex classics, entertain two groups of chatty young women, hold conversation with us, make a uni student feel welcome (even if she just wanted a peppermint tea and a cosy place to enjoy it) and put up with the arrogant old man who made it clear who was the ‘servant’ and who was paying for the pure blonde.

3. I believe the human brain is an incredibly powerful gift from God that we don’t fully utilize. You’ve heard before that the average person uses only 6-10% of the potential of their brain. So what happens when you tap into the other 90%? is this why some people can walk on water, control the weather etc.?

We lost dear Wilson (Willy, Wilsonator, clown-boy, WeeWee) this year. Neither of us can stand to look at a Golden Retreiver yet without tearing up. As naughty & irritating as he could be at times, he was very sweet, often amusing & a great friend. I miss him.

In my line of work, I encourage people to do continuous learning, whether it be attending conferences, courses or simply reading in order to further themselves personally and professionally. We offer a certification programme to office staff – it is a professional certification in that once you have attained the rating, you need to recertify every 5 years by gaining a certain number of points by doing continuous learning.

ANALYSIS: A year ago, if anyone had told me I would be reading a sci-fi book and actually enjoy it, I would have probably laughed. But I have a weakness for extremely pretty book covers, and after reading the overview of Across the Universe I thought I’d give it a try. I wasn’t disappointed, and in fact, I was somewhat surprised.

There were some interesting parts, I can’t say it was a horrible book – but it wasn’t that great either. I guess in the long run I would have to rate the book a C.
This inspires me. Sometimes I worry about my low word counts, but then I see something like this and I remember that I work at the pace I can work at, and that’s ok. And slow as it is, it still sometimes feels like my writing is consuming me. Which isn’t a bad thing at all…

Santa Jr. ... Hallmark Channel ... 10 AM
How obnoxious should an author be? How loud should we shout about our successes, good reviews, foreign publishing deals? Does self-promotion make us look like big-headed show-offs, or needy and desperate? And which platforms are appropriate for what kind of promotion? Sometimes one feels like this vuvuzela-blasting man in New York, loud, irritating and embarrassing, trying to wake up an oblivious world.

The new lens, which can also serve double duty on a APS-C crop camera (equivalent to the angle of view from a 40mm) will have a RRP of £619.99 / Eur 739 (inc VAT) / $699.95and will be available from 24th May. The new lens was announced alongside the new D3200 (not covered), an interesting addition if only because of its new 24MP sensor.

The U.S. health care reform law of 2010 allows employers to charge obese workers 30 percent to 50 percent more for health insurance if they decline to participate in a qualified wellness program. The law also includes carrots and celery sticks, so to speak, to persuade Medicare and Medicaid enrollees to see a primary care physician about losing weight, and funds community demonstration programs for weight loss.
That’s another thing: when people say ‘Wow your horse is beautiful’, what am I supposed to say? ‘Thank-you’? That seems a little arrogant. I had nothing to do with my horse’s looks. Do I say ‘I know’? That seems even worse. I normally laugh and say ‘He knows it, too!’, for lack of a better response.

In Nørrebro you will find the excellent brewpub Nørrebro Bryghus, the small, but well-stocked beer café Ølbaren as well as the friendly specialist beer shop Høkeren.

Over the six days, I spent a lot of time reading and relaxing, but also made time to go for a few runs and long walks. We also made time to get out on the ocean for a sunrise whale watch and snorkel trip to molokini crater. Coming home with a bit of a golden glow, never hurts either.
The history of Mothering Sunday in the UK is quite interesting. It started out as mainly a religious day where the whole community set aside a certain Sunday for them to return to their mother church. Basically, what this means is that they would attend church services at their regular church throughout the year but just on that one specific Sunday, everybody would attend the service held by the mother or main church in their area.

I’ve gotten a lot of “I’m sorry for your loss”s today, but let me say right now — I’m actually really okay. I actually almost feel more guilty about not feeling more sad than I do sad.
I am really tempted to pile the kids in the van and take off for the summer back to family in Ohio. But then again, we are working really hard in therapy at the moment with Sophie. Things are going really well. I can't just give that up and pull her out for an extended time away. Not to mention we have a solid week in hospital planned for Jude and Angelina mid summer. And my Lauren gets married in August! She needs me here to help with planning and prepping.

The dinner table all dressed up and waiting for Thanksgiving dinner. We kept the tablescape very simple because it is custom for us to put all the food on the table and do the passing around the table thing. The table is partially done in this photo as we had not yet added the water glasses and other drink glasses and cups.

I do this for me. I do this to be a good role model. And I do this to show that I am not always available to drop everything for others. Sounds funny but I want my family to respect that some things are important to me. And I deserve time to pursue my dreams and goals.
(Also, my computer keeps overheating, another reason why my hands are shaking. I'll be sad if my computer melts, but I just want it to wait a couple more months. Or at least until I can go home to back it up again tonight.)

Is our theology of the cross big enough to cover our sins, Church? Or do we need to find our own coverings–covering over our sins ourselves–in order to save face? What we do with this issue will show exactly how big our Jesus is…not in fuzzy inclusiveness, but in forgiveness of real sin.

Today’s gospel lesson has the Sadducees trying to trap Jesus. You see they do not believe in the resurrection of the dead so asking if a man dies and leaves a childless wife then she marries the dead man’s brother and on and on until the all die, so whose wife is she in the resurrection? You see they do not believe we are resurrected. So why trap Jesus?

Am I taking a prejudicial position here? What does go on in men's heads? Is it really the case that if a woman plain or otherwise offers herself to a bloke he's in there like a rat up a drainpipe? It is just his biological imperative? I mean I don't mind if it is like that but is it really that basic? I'm talking about normal men here, not your politicians, Trumps or movie stars?

Things are typically quiet over at the Theater an der Wien for much of May as they not only have the annual Festwochen opera to prepare for but also a big Festwochen play or two (this year Simon Stephens’ Three Kingdoms). The opera is of course Deborah Warner’s Traviata, which opens on the 27th. Irina Lungu sings Violetta and Vienna regular Saimir Pirgu Alfredo, Omer Meir Wellber conducts. The strange figures in the image above show Rudy Sabounghi’s costume designs (limp-wristed cross-dressing Alfredo might explain a lot, but I fear the wtf-ery here is of a different nature).

There seems to be a bit of a buzz about bookshops at the moment - those independents which are bursting with individuality and character as well as offering a great selection of reads. The first thing I noticed was The Guardian's Independent Bookshop guide back in September. Then there was a post by Jen Campbell saying she wanted to write a series of 'spotlights' to help spread 'the joy of physical bookshops'. You can read the first of her posts about Ripping Yarns here, the bookshop where Jen herself works.

If either of these two propositions sounds a bit far-fetched, then if you have tried to learn a language other than your primary language, it doesn't seem so far fetched at all. I was taught how to pronounce Italian - it's pretty regular with strong correspondence between letters and sounds. So, give me a page of Italian, I can read it out loud. I can decode it. What I can't do,. though is understand it.
Earlier in the year, I sat down and checked out the brewpubs along the way. I sent Satan the list, with a list of regional beers we should look for, and he suggested that I might be a bit anal about the trip.
This might be grievous for you to receive that the breakup happened, but you cannot continue the relationship the way its going. You need to receive that the breakup happened so that you can work on electrifying your relationship. Now reuniting after a break up means closing the beginning relationship and then starting new rather than trying to light again things in the same way they were before.
The origin of the castle and the town are lost in time. Legend says that a Frankonian king (466—511) founded the fortress on the present castle heights. The first known record of Königstein however dates from 1215. Königstein castle was a royal foundation but during the French Revolutionary Wars the fortress was blown up by French troops in 1796 and now the castle ruins is under the supervision of the municipality of Königstein.

Perhaps some of my disappointment in this “romantic” movie stems from disliking Blackie Norton. Like the characters in the film, I didn’t approve of the way he treated Mary. Yet, by the time Blackie goes through a transformation and decides to become a better man (one presumes, now that his cold, dark atheist heart has found the light of God), I was bored — although as I said before, the eye-rolling could have been due to how many times I had restart the DVD.

Thanks to an awesome college advisor, I wound up receiving two majors: literary studies and historical studies. (Don’t laugh, that’s UTD for you. Just round up and call ‘em lit and history.) I started off with literary studies because it was the closest I could get to creative writing without paying $28k a year at a private arts college. Writing fiction is easy. Writing good fiction, for me, started with being able to write good non-fiction: literary essays. By creating verbally blown up diagrams of any particular novel or poem, it allowed me to understand not just what makes a story enjoyable to read, but also how a story ticks, how it moves and affects the reader. The historical studies degree was just a happy accident.

It was in July 2010, after the routine investigation indicated that Khan was not telling the truth about his trips to Peshawar, that the ISI official in charge of the investigation decided that the matter was suspicious enough to bring it to the attention of the Counter Terrorism Wing (CTW) of ISI, according to Qadir's ISI sources. Those sources told Qadir they believed CTW asked the CIA for satellite surveillance of Khan's residence in Abbottabad. "I thought it was worth getting satellite coverage and forwarded the request to HQ, after consulting with my officers," the official who made the decision told Qadir. "It could have turned out to be nothing important, but if there was an important person hiding there, I would look like an incompetent fool."

The people I don’t understand are the people that used to work for me. Those betrayals don’t make any sense at all. I wonder what kind of mental acrobatics those people have to do to somehow turn me into a villain. What, I didn’t pay you enough? I didn’t loan you enough? I didn’t take you on enough trips? I didn’t bail you out enough? What? Are you telling me that you had an inalienable right to get paid to sit at home?

We have forgiven. We have loved them. Now, it is time to get as far away from them as possible. I do not believe that Christ would have me leave my child in the midst of a pit of vipers. One of the reasons He blessed her with parents is so that we can protect her from people like these.
But, thanks to the wonder of Facebook and perseverance by all of us, we managed to reconnect with E in the past few months. We've exchanged lots of emails and planned to get together whenever two or more of us was in the same place. E lives in New Hampshire, L in London, and me in KSA. We had tried to all be in the same place at the same time, but, sadly, L couldn't make it home in June. E's mom and I set the date for me to go to the family home for dinner.
In London I went to see a concert in Regent's Park by a Brazilian jazz band, and of course it bucketed down. The band, who were called "Samara" featuring guest Brazilian vocalist Jandira Silva, and Colonel Gadaffi on keyboards (see photo), were right up my street, and despite the rain I pulled out my travel maracas (which I always carry in my voluminous handbag) to chug along with them. Bandleader Steve Rubie invited me to come up and ting his triangle, on which, as you all know I am a virtuoso.

When he turned 26, he was in Afghanistan. For his birthday, we sent him a DVD of us gals (me and A) telling him happy birthday. We sang to him, we blew him kisses. We also included the DVD of A from right after she was born; first bath, those kinds of things. We sent him tons of photos. We sent goodies, typical care package stuff. He loved it. He especially loved the video footage and getting to see his girls. He said he got teary-eyed watching A get her first bath because she was crying and so upset. Oh how he loved that baby girl and he hadn't even met her. It was so obvious. He thought she was the bees knees. He just couldn't wait to meet her.

We really struggled to find nice places to eat in Naples. There are many, many hole in the wall pizza places which are great for a quick bite but in the evening it's nice to sit and take your time. I had a list of restaurants I'd found recommended and so the first evening we went in search of one. I put the address into the maps app on my phone and off we went. We went backwards and forwards past the flashing blue dot on the map but there was no corresponding restaurant door. The only time we successfully found a recommended restaurant was when we phoned and made a reservation and then got a taxi to take us there. Weird.
The fare was $7.60. He gave me a twenty and got out of the car. To me, that qualifies as a huge tip. And you know what? It totally made my day. Unfortunately I didn't get the chance to tell him that.

First, I had my inspection earlier today and was THRILLED with the results! The inspector that I've hired for all of the homes I've bought (and then eventually sold) in Denver is awesome - and one of the things that I always love about him is how thorough he is. As in I have 32 pages of findings from today's inspection.

At around 3 AM I was up and super hungry so I made some fritos con queso and pico de gallo. I added a little milk (rice) to make it smoother. My dog and I shared that cause she was hungry too. LOL When I woke up first at 10 AM I felt seriously sick to my tummy like I was going to throw up. I took a pill, but the feeling kind of lasted for most of the day until around 7 PM. Then, I didn't really eat anything until around 1 or 2 I guess and I didn't have my first (and only) cup of 1/2 caff coffee until then either. Seriously wondering if this has anything to do with why I felt so good pain-wise. I had some leftover Chinese food with white rice for lunch. A bowl of puffins rice cereal with coconut milk later as a snack. This evening I had two pieces of a frozen pizza for dinner. Supreme style or something like that with olives, mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni, onions and??? Not too bad, but then I had 3 pudding cups!!! 2 chocolate and one vanilla. They tasted very sweet to me and very chemically, but I ate them anyways. I had some ginger ale this afternoon to settle my stomach and just water to drink tonight and throughout the day. I also squeezed in a mini butterfinger bite sized candy (which I'm not supposed to have because I have issues with peanuts and peanut butter, I believe) and a pack of fruit snacks. So I didn't really have any fresh fruit or fresh (not cooked) veggies today that I can recall. I will try better tomorrow and maybe make myself a salad with some shrimp for lunch. That sounds good!
Okay. Let’s depart from that for a second and take a more serious tack. Now this bloke isn’t your run of the mill Vermin Supreme, your satirical, attention seeking 4chan troll. He may be ridiculous, but he’s kind of dangerous. Like our dear friend Gina he’s got an agenda, namely “cutting red tape” or more accurately giving free run of the country to the super rich like himself. At the moment, gaining favourable preselection for the seat of Lilley is seeming remote, but I assure you, should he gain it and anymore influence, it would be a dark day for our supposedly egalitarian society. People like Mr Palmer and Ms Rinehardt are like poison within our system, using their immense wealth, built up via exploitation and inheritance to alter the flow of opinion and change political decisions in their favour, be it to deregulate business, encourage socially conservative views, or skew the “debate” on anthropogenic climate change. The consolidation of the power should be rightly feared, and opposed at every turn. Robber barons should not, nor ever be, a part of Australian society.

He first gave me this perplexed look and then proceeded to provide his advice. I was waiting for some magical words of wisdom but none really came. His response was something to the effect of “tilt your head to the side and jump on one leg”. Wow!
Guitars are understated throughout, and singer/co-producer Jack Steadman’s penchant for making bedroom-electronica off duty has permeated these grooves without smothering them in ‘blub-’ or any other kind of ‘step’. Yes, the videos still display awkward, cringe-worthy naivety that could inspire the next The Inbetweeners movie, but this music is a mature mix of jaunty and jaundiced.

First, keep in mind, I only started my blog four months ago and a rock probably knows more about computers than I do.
Anyway, this post serves you all notice in a way. I’m scheduling this into your “now,” the 20th of April, because as some of you read this, I am on an airplane headed to train a little bit at Fort Benning, and then another series of planes (three or four) that will take me into Afghanistan. This notice also lets you know that whereas I’ve posted daily – sometimes more – since August of 2011, I have to disappoint you and let you know that for the next year, there’s going to be no predictability as to when I will post. Sorry.
Altogether, the teaching model families create a way to help teachers to organize their learning environments and to help plan instruction to be effective and productive. We must remember that the goal of education is not just instilling knowledge into students but to also producing effective learners who can function in a social world. This requires a focus on not just direct instruction but to provide opportunities to develop in all realams. Understanding models of teaching can help to produce effective teachers who understand the needs of their students and help to create effective learning environments that encourage growth and productive learning.

Funny how just the thought of what others “might” think of us can keep us from following our dreams, but why? Negative thinking and fear can be powerful deterrents in our life, keeping us from truly embracing who we were created to become. It makes us question the unknown when a big fact of life is every day is unknown. And it is that very fact that made me embrace this quote from the Lorax’s wonderful complex character The Once-ler: “It’s not about what it is. It’s about what it can become.”

And she isn’t the only hijacker that Norway has granted political asylum to. Norway also granted asylum on humanitarian grounds to two Iranian nationals who hijacked a Russian Aeroflot plane in 1993 and forced it to land in Norway.

David Horsey began honing his craft of editorial cartooning at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in 1979, and was eventually the recipient of two Pulitzers (so far), in 1999 and 2003. But like most op-ed cartoonists, he also gamely tried out his luck with a syndicated comic strip. January 6 1986 saw the debut of Boomers' Song from Tribune Media Services. The strip was a look at life for baby-boomers, hence the name of the strip. In the 1980s, Baby Boomers were in their late-20s to late-30s, and the driving force behind the American economy and culture. The boomers came in for a lot of criticism, some self-imposed, for their egomania, their love of money, and their self-serving politics. When compared with the previous generation, the hippies, they seemed incredibly banal and self-centered.

BSL ignores the source of the problem: irresponsible pet ownership. Owners must understand that they are fully responsible for the actions of their pet. Letting a dog run free, not getting them neutered, not socializing them properly, putting them in high risk situations – these are all things that set dogs up for accidents, including bites and attacks, absolutely regardless of breed. BSL does not hold owners accountable for their actions, which puts everyone in jeopardy even with the bans.

I'm not making a peep, even if the glasses aren't perfect because of ever-changing blurriness. The reading lenses are spectacular spectacles, however.

So when I got a call from someone who introduced himself as a reporter from the Sand Paper, I knew what he meant. He asked me some questions about my writing and my book and my upcoming visit at the LBI library. This was about a week before we left for the beach, and in the days leading up to it, I couldn’t find any article on the Sand Paper’s site that mentioned me, so I didn’t know if it had run. In fact, by the time we arrived on the island, I’d forgotten there was even the possibility of a story.
First, out of Boston, a TV news reporter raises a question that could be asked anywhere in the country: Whether confidential informants are gaming the system, "continuing to commit crimes while exerting too much control over government investigations." "'There is almost no crime that a criminal informant cannot work their way out of,' Natapoff told FOX Undercover. 'Terrorism. Drug dealing. Murder. Child pornography. Nothing is off-limits. And because of that we send a terrible message in our criminal justice system that every crime is negotiable.'"

As I've hinted on this blog already, the new book is a complete departure from my previous work - a different genre, because although I've had some success, the market for 'Rom Com', 'Chick Lit', Contemporary Women's Fiction, whatever you want to call it, has become so much more difficult that I realised I needed to make a change. Although I was pleased with the new book, I had no idea whether anyone was going to like it - so if nothing else, my lovely new agent has given my confidence a boost and convinced me it's worth a shot!

The guy who volunteered to brave the blade trap and find the first activation switch (RJ) only pulled it off by 5 seconds. He had to pocket the first couple things he saw and ran up for all he was worth before his character was drowned or suffocated. Everybody let loose a sigh of relief, examined the treasure, and saw that it was all very very valuable.

it's sea glass hunting time again! i've had good luck lately and just this weekend found another very rare piece of red glass! when i spotted it, it was under water, and a wave was coming. the only thing to do was wait and hope it would still be there when the ocean calmed, it was! the above photo shows some of my best pieces i've collected over the years. and though i like them all, the turquoise and aqua colors are my favorites. i found this book pure sea glass by richard lamotte, this weekend too, at the sea glass festival my sister and i went to. it's a fantastic reference. it describes where different colors may originate from, it could be that these pieces started as a bottle or dish or even a lantern. i'm so happy to add this to my library, if you like collecting sea glass, and would like to know more about it, i think you'll love this book.

My perspective on what "fitness" means has changed too, as I continue to feed my flying addiction. There is the literal flying fitness level - being able to do the little things effortlessly like carry your glider to launch or back to your car and running off launch without pulling a muscle (hey - I've seen it happen!). Personally I'm failing at this right now...my back started protesting Thursday morning from abusing it too much. Like getting dehydrated (my chiropractor said this also depletes the fluid in your spinal column which leaves you prone to back injuries...makes sense), and then throwing my tandem gear around without using the proper "bend your knees and lift" technique. I also went on a hike and fly with some friends...they hiked all the way up and I joined them until the halfway point since I volunteered to be the driver this time. It's sad to think that fun little hike could be the reason my back went out, but a good reminder to take care of yourself every day so you can prevent stuff like this happening.
Just when calm common sense would tell us to ease forward slowly, with care, to avoid going out of control, people were instead careening wildly, tearing forward on the bumpy, ice / snow combination. In a 5-minute journey, drivers of three different vehicles tried to end my life, as I drove to work today.

I’m not sure I know what’s going on and this is because you’ve made up a world in your head and then discussed it with me without telling me how it works.

The brain is explainable as a complex – extremely complex – physical machine. It is sometimes likened to a computer, and it is easy to see the correlation. A computer is a lot faster than a brain at the activities it does, and never makes mistakes, but the brain is hugely more complex, and runs a machine that keeps it alive long enough to produce offspring.

We had some afternooon tea up at the summit and enjoyed the view although it was a bit hazy.

In order to retain legitimacy at a level that allows some freedom of action, the government must endeavor to deliver real economic progress to its constituents. That means that every policy should be slaved to increasing incomes in line with increases in worker productivity, and improving the long-term financial wealth of the greatest number. (The best way to measure the success of government efforts in this regard are increases in the median incomes of individuals.) One method of achieving this, already mentioned above, is to remove barriers to community resilience. Community resilience has the potential to substantially improve the incomes and quality of life for the greatest number by reducing end-user costs, creating jobs, and spurring massive leaps in innovation.

When I was younger I had a sort of a shoe fetish—sorts of an extreme love for shoes. I remember my dad counting all the shoes I had in my closet once—all 36 pairs of them. And that was without including the amount of boots and winter shoes I had. Phew! Yeah, I love shoes—or at least I used to. As I mature, I’m becoming more and more my true self. It has been a discovery too. Growing a particular fondest for the natural world and natural ways has been an uplifting experience. And thus, nowadays I'm barefoot if I can possibly be so. Still... I do wear shoes ;)

Today I am happy to welcome Australian author Jennifer Paynter to my blog. She has been a journalist, a playwright and has now released a novel, Mary Bennet which was published by Penguin Australia on the 26th April 2012. It focuses on the ‘forgotten’ Bennet sister, re-telling Pride & Prejudice from her point of view as Bingley and Darcy arrive into the lives of the family. You can find out more about Jennifer, her work and of course her new novel at her website. Jennifer has written a little piece about just why she chose to write about the unfortunately-viewed Mary Bennet and how she came about understanding her as a character and building her as a protagonist for her novel.

I spent a lot of the week thinking about my life. About my job, which I don't like. About how I don't know how to stand up for myself. I struggled with the idea of even attempting to, felling it was ungodly, though I know it isn't. I realized that even if this was nothing, something, someday, something tragic and life changing is coming. Whether its to me or a loved one, its coming. And I need that reality to change my life. I need to learn to stand up for myself and not be a door mat. I need to figure out how I can serve this world because I am convinced that I will only be fulfilled if I am serving those in need. I need to find a way to start, here in Bellingham.

Of course, very few of us are ever going to race at a national level event, much less an international one. But, many of us not only ride on the road we may enter an area road race occasionally, like to compete in the local weekly time trial series, or do a couple of triathlons a year. Or maybe we’re passionate roadies and early adopters of new technologies and are willing to try a new product for the potential gain we’ll see in our performance on our local club ride. Any of these situations make the aero road bike an excellent alternative to another “standard” road bike offering. Why? Because it’s basically two bikes for the price one.
Calvin’s example of stressing order and decorum in church worship is commendable. As a Presbyterian, I can at least give him that much credit. His distinction between God-ordained commands and human-devised rules is also a useful model as we try to extricate from its cultural seat the truth of scripture for today’s practical application in our many and various church settings. Even his admittance that indifferent rules may be suspended when necessary (if not amended or entirely altered) shows a flexibility in order and structure that allows one at least to breathe, if not grow.

Day 5: I started feeling my energy coming back, even more than before! It was great. My cravings and hunger pangs have also disappeared. But I think the energy had something to do with having my first pure fruit juice the night before, which gave me insomnia cuz I didn’t know what to do with that energy! I guess vegetable juices for a few days made my blood sugar a bit low. Or , I dunno. Actually, I realized something by then, that I hadn’t been drinking ENOUGH. I was only drinking maybe three 5oz glasses a day. And I read that you need to drink between 16-32oz a day! So I upped my juice intake. However, I found out I didn’t lose any weight due to two glasses of pure fruit juice (which was SUPER SWEET O.O) the night before. Weight: 68.1 kg.

Oh God. Is it January already? Beneath the impact of re-draft 3 (or is it 3.5? I’m losing count), getting married, buying and selling a house, bored and house-bound children and the insanity of my day job, I somehow let December slip.
I realized that all of the hands-on activities were structured around co-located whole teams. Everybody would be split up into teams with one team per table. Assuming that the instructions were easy to follow, each team would work together to figure out and perform the exercise.
These two films street on April 10 and hopefully more will be released before the eventual demise of the DVD format (get those disks while you can, collectors!). Actually, I just checked and there's a third title (more info here). With all the garbage coming out of Hollywood these days, a nice Roman Porno could be an exciting change of pace. If you've never seen one, now's your chance!

Adaptability to new electronic worlds is all very well, but it is nothing without a streak of hard conservatism. As writers we love neologisms, word play and the whole dazzling funfair of language as she is spoke and bespoke, but we also have a certain interest in stability. We would prefer a word at the end of a paragraph to retain much the same bundle of meanings that it had when it appeared at the beginning of it. We know about the modifications of meaning undergone by any word on its journey through text, and as writers it is our business to know that, but we do rely on the stability of the range.
I'm sure most college students have felt pretty confused at one point or another, especially when it comes to declaring their major. I didn't declare my major (Creative Writing) until the last minute (Junior year), even though I knew when I applied that's what I wanted.

That's the end of the entries in my diary on this, the last day of curfew. When I look back now and try to remember how I felt at that point, the impression I have is one of holding my breath for a very long time. As I said before, the days of curfew had begun to feel relatively safe and secure.
The next prof is warning us that soon people "will find that they must pay for their healthcare, as the private corporations involved in clinical commissioning groups decide what they will and will not offer". Hm. His Labour government must have been spending all that money on something. What, then?

If you have refrigerated the dough overnight, remove it from the refrigerator 1 to 2 hours before you want to bake the cookies. (It’s a dense, rich dough, and once it’s very cold, it takes a little while to soften enough to slice without shattering.)

3-Something about putting on a wedding dress always makes you feel pretty. Even though I had no make up on, was feeling fat, was wearing knee high socks, had to step over a dog and was in my living room filled with laundry and kids....I still felt pretty. Not sure if it was the dress or remembering how I felt in it on my wedding day.
Anyway, the first thing you should know is that I don’t typically like to talk about that time, which is especially difficult when you meet new people, say where you’re from and the typical reaction is one of immediate concern. I get that – and appreciate it, but as someone who can be too introspective sometimes, it’s sometimes better for me just not to venture into the conversation at all. I get really emotional about it and it’s not pretty. I do NOT cry pretty – like at all. I cry like someone who tries to hold in her tears until she can’t anymore and the tears come gushing out in big ugly crying fits… because, well that’s exactly what happens to me. BUT as much as I love that city and I am thankful for everything God has done in these five years and what He did to keep my family safe during that time, I figured I would be remiss not to say anything.

The Spider bears a great similarity to the Goddess Baba Yaga. In its more “destructive” shadow form, like Baba Yaga, the spider initiates us and that initiation can be painful and terrifying. Like Baba Yaga, the spider consumes us, devouring our old selves and allowing a new self to be reborn. Like Baba Yaga, the spider’s realm is that psychological and shamanic Lower world, ever deeper in the forest. We enter Baba Yaga’s hut or the Spider’s cavern, and are directly confronted by our fears.

Awesome cross-country run through the hills and hollows on my family's farm. There is zero snow at home right now, which combined with the middle-of-winter lack of vegetation (grass, brush) made for excellent conditions to strike out in whatever direction I wanted and run fell-style over the hills. My shin seemed good for about 30min or so, but then the last 5min might have been a touch too much for it.

The difference between an American Pale Ale an a American IPA (India Pale Ale) is that when IPAs were transported from Britain to the British colony of India, these brews would require more hops to be used as a preservative to make it through a four-month sea journey. In turn these IPAs acquired a deeper color and a more bitterness from the hops. American brewers who brew IPAs try to replicate the British IPA using American ingredients. Saint Arnold Brewing Company donates a percentage of the proceeds of from Elissa IPA to the Galveston Historical District for the preservation of the brew’s namesake; a tall moored ship similar to those commerce vessels that transported India Pale Ales from Britain to India.
What a cruel and bitter joke that would be.

I recently tried out two shades of the VMV HYPOALLERGENICS Lip Gloss. The shades I have are Giggle and Goo; I like Giggle better. The formulation of these glosses are really nice; they are dye-free, free of irritating waxes, free of all types of fragrance, super shiny, have great pigmentation and feel comfortable on your lips.

But I could not seal myself off in my house for the rest of the day. I muddled through work, but I resisted the lure of the couch and the hockey game. You see, I've signed up to help on the promotions committee for our first local LGBTQ event, and tonight I had to deliver the information update for our team to the entire group. As I drove into downtown Frederick in the twilight and rain, as I navigated the narrow parking garage, finding a spot on the roof, as I walked into a community building on Church St., I realized how many fears I'm facing.

The Childrens Hour has been extended to cover the whole of British broadcasting, and the editors of the national dailies use treacle instead of ink. If one can speak of a general mind in Britain at all just now, it is sodden and limp with the ceaseless drip of adolescent propaganda.At least we can take some comfort in having been there before.

I like making new friends and I like the fact that I've actually come out of that little box of mine that I've been caging myself in, and actually started to go out and have some more friends. Talking to boys is always the hardest thing for me. I've always been in a girls school, never went for tuition, so socializing is a complete no-no. I always thought I had to wait till college life to get all that. Who knew life would be this interesting in 2012? It's unexpected.
It’s time again for the annual ‘Stella Awards’! For those unfamiliar with these awards, they are named after 81-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled hot coffee on herself and successfully sued the McDonald’s in New Mexico, where she purchased coffee. You remember, she took the lid off the coffee and put it between her knees while she was driving. Who would ever think one could get burned doing that, right? That’s right! These are awards for the most outlandish lawsuits and verdicts in the U.S. You know, the kinds of cases that make you scratch your head. So keep your head scratcher handy.
What really pisses me off is how these fans can just shit on the Bella Twins saying they can’t wrestle and that they’re glad they’re gone but praise likes of Kelly Kelly or Alicia Fox. I freely admit that I’m a card carrying member of the Kelly Kelly Hater’s Club. But come on, Kelly Kelly has been in the WWE longer than the other Divas with the exception of Beth Phoenix.Kelly Kelly should be able to perform basic wrestling moves with no issues. Kelly botches more moves in the ring than Teddy long saying “Holla! Holla!” A prime example of the botch fest that I like “Kellyism 101” just watch Kelly Kelly vs. Maxine from this past Thursday WWE Superstars to see what I mean.

It was far too cool-toned and white-based, but after rubbing it in a little and leaving it for a while it seemed to adjust more to my skintone.

17. Expo In Tokyo
As I listened to this testimony my thoughts drifted back to what I was pondering prior to arriving to this event. The people in the streets in New York City, Boston, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Portland, Harrisonburg and Minneapolis, among others, that are blocking traffic and chanting about corporate greed, ARE chanting about the corporate greed of the very same companies that are behind these crimes against humanity. And while OWS may not be outright saying that they are fighting for the human rights of the indigenous people in Guatemala and other oppressed peoples all over the world, any thoughtful person observing Occupy Wall Street could extrapolate that this is part of the message.

Whew! What a week it has been. Coming off a Flea Market weekend, there has been lots of regular life business to take care of this week. On top of that, my daughter came home from college, which I'm thrilled about. Moving all her personal furniture and belongings home was a bit of work. And, I'm in the middle of mailing out high school graduation announcements for my "baby" and have to get his party planned in the next 2 weeks.

Consider also the impact to the federal government when interest rates go up as they will at some point. The cost to finance this massively expanded debt load will then rise to a point where an unsustainable percentage of federal government expenditures will need to go to just this expense.
Nietzsche argues that the masters don’t understand, and so misjudge, the slaves (“the low people”, “the vulgar”), but in turn the slaves project onto their masters an exaggerated mood of contempt. The slaves imagine that their masters hate them, or despise them, but Nietzsche doesn’t believe this to truly be the case. He sees this projected hatred as another attack by the weak against the strong – part of their “vindictive hatred and revengefulness”. Instead Nietzsche believes the masters view the slaves with pity. He draws on Classical Greek etymology to make his point, but ultimately he believes that the masters feel themselves to be happy and well-born, and feel sorry for the unhappy slaves, while the slaves believe that their masters despise them.

He says he was a punk back then. He is still something of a punk. A rival once stood up at a meeting and joked that he’d always thought that the Tib in Tibco stood for “that Indian bastard.” Ranadivé built a house a few years ago with a swimming pool that has an underground window, so from the basement bar you can look in and see people swimming. He yanks his employees out of meetings to challenge them to push-up contests in the hall. He once called Steve Jobs to ask him how to use Photoshop. At a dinner in New York one rainy night a few months ago, after speaking to a bunch of M.B.A.’s, he ordered the most expensive steak on the menu as an appetizer for the employees who were traveling with him. And listen to him in an interview in 2009, talking about his competition: “There are not that many people who can say that they have gone head-on against IBM and beaten them in a situation where IBM has thrown everything and the kitchen sink at a problem and lost.”
CHICAGO is technically flawless, well-staged and executed. But if I hate somebody, why do I want to watch them sing and dance, especially when the topic of their song is how they can stomp all over me and what I believe in? By a certain point, I have written off every character in this movie as a pig. (And not a sweet cuddly pig like Babe or Wilbur, I mean an ugly, smelly, shit-stanky wild boar with tusks, like Mason Verger was breeding to get revenge on Hannibal Lecter, something from Russell Mulcahy's nightmares.) And no matter how much lighting and lingerie and choreography you throw in, you cannot make me forget that I AM WATCHING UGLY FUCKING PIGS IN COSTUME SING AND DANCE. And I don't want to watch ugly fucking pigs in costume sing and dance! I want to slit their throats and eat them so that they never bother anybody again and that I can get finally get some worthwhile item of pleasure from their person.
You may wonder what “fun” has to do with a professional activity. Well, I don’t know about you but if I have my choice between working in a “fun” environment or a not-fun environment, I’ll pick the fun environment every time. Another way to look at fun is “doing something that is satisfying.” I believe that most people want to gain satisfaction from their work and that usually comes from feeling that you have provided something of value that benefits others in some way. In my experience, high job satisfaction corresponds directly to personal productivity.

You may, at some time or other, been in a testimony meeting when one went over the sinful years before the Lord saved him. In fact he probably spent much time explaining in detail sinful activities and then finished by simply saying something like, “But God saved me from all that.” The impression left on the hearers was the joy he had living in sin. We are to bear testimony of Jesus Christ, not of our sinful past.
Roughly chop the tomatoes, apples and onions and place in a large pot. I didn't bother peeling the apples. Bring to the boil and simmer for approx 30 minutes until the fruit is soft and pulpy.

I stayed for the short film package and then roamed some more before heading back to my room to put my stuff down and then head to the VIP party. Luckily for me, I found a seat with Jewell and two awesome people he met that day, Nikki and Randall. There were a hundred VIP passes sold for the weekend and the majority of them were, for lack of a better term, camped out by the door. Plus, there were mountains of muscle men standing at the table behind me so I couldn’t see a bloody thing.

D&D assigns each player a specific character to play. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master serves as the game’s referee and storyteller, while also maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur. The characters form a party that interacts with the setting’s inhabitants (and each other). Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process the characters earn experience points to become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions.

The How-To Series is Born
The label “pornography”, like the word “prostitution”, represents an attempt by lawheads to pretend that their personal hang-ups about sex can be reduced to a rule by which “good” sex can be distinguished from “bad” sex, a bright, clear taboo line which it is not permissible for anyone, even in private, to cross. Ironically, the neofeminist position on the issue is actually more coherent than that of the government; it simply states that any sex not initiated and totally controlled by a woman for her own pleasure (and for no other reason) is fundamentally wrong. The more radical neofeminists (such as Sheila Jeffreys) go even further, declaring that any heterosexual sex is a tool of male oppression. Obviously, this is mad-dog lunacy, but at least it’s consistent lunacy; lawheads, by contrast, try to come up with ridiculous “tests” by which prostitution can be distinguished from other female sexual behavior and pornography can be distinguished from erotica or sex scenes in “literature”. We’ve often discussed the former, but today I’d like to look at the latter.

Fifth, Wilkinson’s argument balances between divining of spirits and the Spirit’s leading without biblically distinguishing the differences. One is heretical and the other biblical. Without further explanation, Wilkinson’s premise treads through dangerous territory. When teaching how to distinguish when the Spirit nudges, Wilkinson does an insufficient job at providing biblical parameters.

Why?? A school trip - a GCSE History revision day at a University in London - they were leaving school at 6.30am prompt - so we were awake early for big son to get showered, fed, down a couple of cups of coffee and open some cards & pressies too.
“You know you’re right,” Ash said softly switching to a subject with old pain instead of new, “Mom is going to be really upset.”
"You have danced beautifully, Margareta. I truly have found a pearl here in Bucharest. It was such a pleasure for me. You seem to have brought me to the same Keyhole into the Universe that little girl named Pearl saw as I danced with you. Isn't that the best of what tango has to offer us, a way to sense the beauty of another person through their embrace?"

We pulled up all the dead stuff, cut the grass, trimmed the edges of the lawns, hoed and planted up some pots. We also jetwashed the paths and patio and filled in the spaces with sand and cement.

So, I don't often talk about my real job on the blog here not because of privacy so much as just it's boring. It's a good job but it's never been something that has interested me personally. It is a position that I was very lucky to kind of fall into when we moved to Houston and I have really enjoyed working there! BUT the goal was always to find a way to do something that I am more interested in. But, problem #1: let's get real here for a second- I realize I am an (almost!) 30 year old adult woman but seriously, I don't know what I want to do when I grow up!!!
Oh yeah, 4 hours at the ballpark... I'm exhausted. LOL. Good thing I didn't do anything else the rest of the day - LOL. I did get the kids off to school on time. Jake's alarm went off for 30 minutes (6:45-7:15) before he got up and turned it off, but he did get up and turn it off and hopped right in the shower. So that was good.

So, if the dish is chicken – that would suggest a light white wine. However, if it is cooked in a rich sauce then something heavier might well work better.
Lunch with any three people who ever lived; who do you invite?
I’m definitely a nuturer. I have no desire to have kids, but when I like/love somebody (and it’s my significant other- I am like this with friends as well but not to the extent), I will do whatever I can to take care of them. I loved doing my ex’s laundry (when I had time) and cleaning the house for us. I loved cheering him up and being the one he called when he was down. I wanted to take care of it when his car was in the shop. I take care of my significant other, probably to a greater extent than most people I know in relationships.

So, sending more troops into Afghanistan, Drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, etc. These are indications of Islam getting a "free pass?" And why would Islam not get a "free pass?" Because it's not a religion of which you approve? There are over a billion Muslims in the world. The vast, overwhelming majority of these are not doing anything wrong. It's like if you feel that Obama isn't cracking down on the Mafia hard enough, is that giving a "free pass" to Catholicism?

I received an e-mail several months ago from a friend asking me if I wanted to go to Laguna Beach for 2 day with Rob Bell. The e-mail describing the event was pretty vague really. It had a price, a rough sketch of the event, the location and that there were 50 spots available. So, myself and 2 other friends - Mark and Scott- decided to pull the trigger and do it, kinda seeing it as a once in lifetime opportunity to rub shoulders in this context. Within 30 minutes of the e-mail blast, all 50 spots were gone.

It is worth pointing out that as originally envisioned this was a five page script and the text was originally intended to be a variety of floating words in overlapping boxes rather than speech bubbles (except in the final splash panel) but at some point after being entrusted to the Royal Mail it got condensed down into the form you see here. The title is nicked from Jean Baudrillard’s Simulations, the English translation of which was one of my favourite books while at college. I should also point out that this little story predates The Matrix by a good five or six years and part of me would like to believe that the brothers Wachowski somehow came across the comic it was printed in and were inspired to create their movie, but I suspect that the truth is probably rather simpler: they just read the same source text and liked it too. Incidentally, I had absolutely no idea that this had been published in any form whatsoever until I came across a single copy of the comic anthology it ended up in being sold on a stall in the Green Field at Glastonbury in the late nineties. Naturally I bought it and hopefully still have it somewhere.

Nick Hornby’s monthly column in The Believer magazine begins each month with a list of all of the books he has bought that month, ranging from one, (usually a Dickens), to a fairly long and often eclectic list. But when I say ‘fairly long’ I am, as someone who can go out for a fifteen minute walk and somehow come back with half a dozen paperbacks, using the term more or less ironically. Sometimes even I don’t know where they’ve come from.

The immediate instinct when you hear someone you love has cancer is to offer whatever help you can, even when you don’t know exactly what to offer. I know my folks have derived a great deal of strength from friends and family. So have I. I’m not a religious person, but the only way I know how to characterize this is as a blessing.

I have been in awe of her boundless energy, enthusiasm, optimism and joie de vivre ever since, and when she teamed up with Dietmar a few years later, those qualities doubled in size and range. The two of them left untried no pleasure, no new experience, no happiness. They travelled and explored the regions of the world together as well as all the delights on offer nearer home. They drew in old friends and new, both their families and children (both were widowed), anyone they touched with their infectious enthusiasm came away richer for the experience and determined to try to emulate them. In every photo I have of them, whether at their cosy fireside at home, in a circle of friends, on skis in the mountains or cycling and walking in all weathers, their wide open smiles are the first thing you notice. Smiles that are unposed and natural, not the usual photographic cheesy grins. Theatre, music, books and sports, they embrace it all, jointly and separately. In her last letter Gisela describes their travels of the previous year, taking in a walking tour on the Rhine, high above the river, with frequent stops for a revivifying glass of local wine, a couple of trips to visit children and grandchildren in Austria and Liechtenstein, and an exploration of Vietnam and Myanmar in September and October. Their last trip ended just before New Year's Eve. Just reading her letter left me breathless. Compared to the two of them, Beloved and I are dull and lifeless.

It is a similar story in many capitals. As the city has expanded the centre has lost out on funding. Out of town shopping centres like Plenilunio and Isla Azul, with their ease of parking - if not easy connection to public transport(!) - have taken retail trade away. But all is not lost. My spies tell me that as the licenses for the various businesses in Gran Via come up for renewal, the city council will press for change of use. They want to attract the major names back. Over the next few years, “la crisis” permitting, Gran Via will hopefully be restored to its former glory. Already, following a fire, the street will have its first new building in nearly a century.

We arrived at the Austin Motel last night. A place I highly recommend for people looking for a bare bones, reasonably priced lodge. It's in a really great location with plenty of fun shops and good eats all around (more on that in a bit). The service is friendly and warm and since they were the first people in Austin to truly greet us, my initial impression was a good one.

vs 21-22: And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the LORD did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
What about technology companies such as Sony, who could contribute their digital video knowledge to the centre? Individual knowledge-based firms could also help out, especially those in the independent TV sector such as Tinopolis, Green Bay and Boomerang. Dinamo TV, which makes the popular Rastamouse series, is a leader in their field of animation whilst Bangor-based Gaia Technologies has 3-D educational software that is amongst the best in the World.

In Harlequin, a ballet dancer in full costume stands upon a stage, his downcast gaze communicating his isolation. The flatness of the dancer’s costume, emphasized by its geometric pattern, contrasts with the weight and volume of his hands, and its monotone background conflicts with the depth achieved by the curtain. Thus, this rare painting stands as a unique amalgamation between the subject matter of the blue and rose periods and the play with perspective and illusionism found in his cubist works.
On my recent excursion to New York City for Fashion Week, I opted for the boots on days I felt heels would be too much of a hassle. To dress up the boots a bit more, I added the Moondance I to the top of my boots as I walked through the tents and around the city. I received so many compliments, with many thinking that the embellishment on the top was part of the boot. I told them it was a brand called The 2 Bandits, which became a conversation starter. The company has so many Bandits to choose from that it will be impossible to ever get bored with the same pair of boots.
I thought I would share all of this with you....you know so you can laugh along with me. I am serious about this. For many other reasons besides size. My mom and my nannie both have diabetes 2. So, I am prone to get it. I don't want to get it. Diabetes is a horrible disease. I want to be able to run and play with my girls. Right now, I don't have the energy to run to the mailbox like Kate always wants me to.
We have a perfect example of this with Abraham. In Genesis 15: God told Abraham that he would have a son. His wife Sarah thought this impossible so she thought up a plan which we see in Genesis 16:2. And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.”

A study published in the Journal of Nutrition by the American Society for Nutrition in December showed a notable increase in moodiness in mildly dehydrated women. How dehydrated? 1.36%! And with that very slight dehydration also came headaches, fatigue, soreness, and a decrease in physical and mental performance.
We visited the cemetery today. As usual, we stopped at the flower shop on our way there. Janet, who owns the flower shop, gave us a knowing smile as we walked in. She knew why we were there. She knew what day it was. Before we even asked, she pulled out a bouquet of pink and yellow roses that she had already hand picked just for us. She handed them to Katie, along with an extra rose for her to keep. I tried to pay her for the flowers, but she wouldn't take my money. She remembers Jill, and considered her a friend. She said the flowers are her gift to us and to Jill. Katie forced a smile and said "thank you" as Janet handed her the roses. She looked at them and a tear ran down her cheek as the smell of roses brought back a flood of memories. I put my arm around her and held her close as I thanked Janet for the flowers, and we went on our way.
So today I got to practice what is called, in OCD treatment, an “exposure.” That means dealing with something that makes me anxious and check-y; in this case, I got distracted by work and was unable to complete something that’s generally supposed to be finished at the end of the week. By the time I found out, none of the people who could help fix it were available. There was literally nothing I could do.
If you saw The Raven starring John Cusack last weekend and are still craving Poe, you could purchase a copy of In Poe’s Shadow, a collection of short stories inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Schoonover’s piece, “VanityVanity,” which was inspired by Poe’s “The Oval Portrait,” is in this anthology.
this hairstyle is the most dressed up in my opinion. if you turn up to school with curly hair, people know you've made an effort. the great thing about this hairstyle is that it can be worn for up to 3 days saving you lots of time and effort. Unfortunatley it does consume quite alot of time and it requires waking up extra early. so if you have an early class in the morning, id skip this hairstyle (go to bed extra early if you are THAT determined) i recommend this hairstyle to girls who are fortunate enough to have a late start in their schedule (yey me)

We’ve nevertheless known for quite a while that, prior to the appearance of words, babbling and babbling patterns provide reliable indicators of typical development. But descriptions of babbling often concern what analysts can recognise as syllables, vowels and consonants, that is, “word-like” baby utterances. Should we then look for words and word-like productions as evidence of the earliest linguistic resources that children have available? We might be looking in the wrong places, actually. Perhaps what wordless babies are said to lack, according to popular benchmarks, is instead what popular benchmarks themselves lack.

Now what my friend forget to tell me was how much these walnuts stain! This is after I washed my hands a couple of times - it, in fact, got darker the more I washed them :-s Not fab for someone who works in a hospital - luckily a lot of the patients know me well already so aren't too surprised about me picking walnuts and having stained hands from it :-)
On Monday night, which just let me preface is the only evening I get off without having to do anything before the weekend so its a good time for me to get some rest and get an early night, I was feeling partially beat so we ordered takeaway.

A neutral color palette is also another great choice for a unisex nursery. The simple white crib becomes the focal point with the romantic canopy framing it. I especially like the brown and white bergere chair - a little unexpected in a nursery.

It’s a strange, strange thing to hear your own book discussed by readers. People pick up on odd things, they have their own ideas about characters. One perceptive reader had picked up on quite subtle hints about relationships between sisters, about motherhood and Catholicism. The book starts to have its own life. It’s like that moment at mother and toddler group when you realise that your toddler has toddled off and is finger-painting on someone else’s floor. You’re proud and scared and you feel utterly responsible and slightly redundant.
From the position of those who depend on foreign travelers for a living, however, there should be a service component to properly welcome visitors and their open wallets. Maybe we shouldn’t aim for a check-in-at-the-Four-Seasons experience, but we should be able to deliver a Marriott level greeting. At least that seems to be the argument made in a recent New York Times article (A Long Wait Gets Longer, Aug 23).

Five minutes later, the Four Mamas returned with about 15 guards from the garden who honestly looked a little bewildered by the whole situation. Then things took their expected and natural French course with a lengthy discussion between all parties that lasted at least the 32 more minutes I stayed and probably long after I left.

Heh. To keep the insanity from taking over, why else? Well, that's not really the reason. ;) One reason for me personally would be to get some stories out there that I think would be a great story. Let's go back in time. See young Icewolf? Say hi, Young-Icewolf! Anyway, when I was younger, I would search and search for specific story plots, but would never find them in my libraries. So I came up with a brilliant idea.

The end result was somewhat satisfactory with some flaws here and there. I had some of the crumbs this morning, leftover when I levelled the cake and it tasted moist. That is when I realised my mistake. I should not refrigerate the cake after covering it with buttercream. I thought it would be better if the buttercream hardens a little before I lay the Marshmallow Fondant. Not only the cake tasted abit drier, the fondant sweats. Fortunately, the ladies were gracious enough to say it tasted and looked good.
I mean, how do you say no to this?
2.) Learning happens all the time. It is natural and unavoidable. It knows no limits in terms of breadth, depth, location, time, or duration. Every experience - even doing nothing - is a learning experience. The only limits on learning are the ones we arbitrarily impose upon it when we say "you can't learn this way."
But you won't see pictures of him walking in the door exhausted after a day at work or getting up at 4am to fly interstate for the week. He works so hard for this family just like so many families are working hard these days. And you don't see pictures of me on my hands and knees washing bathroom floors or taking out the rubbish or hanging out laundry or doing the school run with a big pregnant belly and a baby on the hip and a little tribe following me. In some ways I am very average doing the regular stay at home mum thing and all the same jobs you do - day in and day out. Just like all families we have bills to pay, financial worries and priorities. Don't judge me by a fancy kitchen renovation. I'm much more than that.
Unfortunately the only clips I could find on YouTube were ones with Alanis Morrisette in her birthday suit; a slighty off Boys II Men rendition - or ones that had a bit too much Jesus.
coriander, cassia, cinchona bark and cloves in a 1-quart Mason jar or other glass container with a lid. Add the bourbon, making sure all the ingredients are covered. (Add more bourbon if needed.)

Strain the liquid through a cheesecloth-lined funnel into a clean 1-quart jar, squeezing the cheesecloth to release any excess liquid. Seal the jar and set aside.
Sunday I hit the airport for a trip to Orlando for work. I was able to get in a few runs during the trip, along iwth standing ALL DAY on the convention floor – meaning my healing process may be a little sloewr.
Whats funny is that at every single doctors appointment we only saw little girls. There was never a single boy in the hospital until the day that we went for the ultrasound. Our first thought was since we are only seeing girls, watch us have a boy. So on the day of our ultrasound when we saw a boy, we didn't know what to think...it was all fun and speculation anyway. After getting the news the doctor said "how tall is dad" apparently our little girl has long limbs. A future basketball star we are certain! They also said that the little one was going to be an intellectual because her brain was developing wonderfully and she was also sucking her thumb!! So cute!! That entire day the little one was just fluttering all around making herself known.
First, for a not-such-a-secret: I loved The Knife and the Butterfly even more than I loved What Can(t) Wait, and, because I love you guys, have ordered a copy from my local indie bookstore.

8:00AM - Garage door contractor shows up (right on time). He spent about 20 minutes looking at the opener with me working the Up/Down button. Turns out the motor drive and drive gear are factory packed with grease, but this particular unit didn't get enough. I suspected this but didn't want to pull it apart and void a warranty. Plus, the installation is still within the installer's warranty - so this wasn't costing me anything but time - which I was already committing to other contractors. Anyway, he greased it all up and it works fine. Off he went by 8:30AM after I signed some stuff.
So thats what happened! I thought it was oh so cool! and now I have to read his Last Dragon Chronicles books! Especially now that I have met him, and have an autographed copy of his book :P
Mehthods of restraint can be severe. One example is that trafficked women are confined to dens while being monitored by pimps. They are kept in crowded rooms and deprived of proper food and clothing, made to do chores and beaten if they do not comply. They are kept as such until they receive a buyer. Once sold the buyer marries the woman to legalise her enslavement. The buyer then either sells her on, makes her work in a brothel or as a labourer in the fields and the house.
But for now... You can bet this apple pie bar will make an appearance on my Thanksgiving menu. It turned out just as I had hoped and it will be a great addition to the fall-seasonal dinner and dessert menu.
Bar Ourcq (photo of boules in front of the bar here). Like 28° Est, Bar Ourcq is also located on the Bassin de la Villette - a beautiful spot where the Canal Saint-Martin widens out up north. The interior here is cute, with free wifi and good music, but the real attraction is along the water. Hundreds of people come here on warm evenings and weekends, buy beer in plastic cups, and take them to sit along the water's edge. The bar also loans out folding chairs and sets of boules, so you'll find tons of young people here playing in the dirt.

But there was still that nagging problem. Ever since spring of my senior year, I’d felt blocked every time I tried to write. I knew what I wanted to say, but I couldn’t do it. I could see that the result wasn’t ideal, and I knew I was capable of doing better. Yet I couldn’t. I got the same sorts of comments on my papers: great ideas, but the writing needs work. I was normally a good writer, which helped me to excel in English.
The system was put in place; farmers and police were coordinating with each other – although at the time this contract was signed, the farmers also indicated concerns that the SAPS had yet to grant them formal permission to install their own radio-communications equipment at the police-stations involved in the border-patrol protection-layers. The farmers had undertaken to pay for these radios: all they needed was the government ‘s permission to install them.
As can be seen from the above, neither the UN nor any other foreign country would intervene should a revolution / civil war break out in the New South Africa. In our case the greatest threat would come from undisciplined rebel forces and being caught in crossfire situations. The ANC Regime has no control over any of the numerous rebel groups currently building up in the New South Africa. The Regime also does not have efficient control over its own Defense Force and the SADF is poorly trained, undisciplined and probably aligned to some of these rebel forces.
Sunday I was supposed to go to a club to see Tensnake but I was so knackered from the past 2 days that I decided to go home early. But not before I had dinner at Ilse’s with a bunch of nice people!

Hypericum Berries – My wonderful friend Chitra used them in her wedding, and she has the best taste of anyone I know. Because I loved them so much, I ended up using them in Homecoming florals at Grove City every year I worked there.
So that's what we have done and over the last few weeks we have visited Impact housing and sourced a dressing table for £20, a bedside table for £5, a cabinet for £15 and a bookcase for £25.
We started off by going to the new Westfield shopping centre in the Pitt Street Mall for yum cha at my favourite yum cha restaurant Sky Phoenix. The refurb of the restaurant isn't much to write home about but the food is still delicious and very band friendly. Well friendly in that dumplings and noodles go down really easily - probably too easily, if you're being strict with calories. I ate probably a bit too much.
And he'd steal so good we figured he'd never get caught.
Number two, and of more interest: Having had more than usual time to reflect on human condition in wake of my not one but two accidents last year - consequently lying on my back more than I expected during my lifetime - it was brought home to me that underneath all our flesh there are bones. Yes, really. It’s the scaffolding our muscles and innards are desperately trying to hang on to.
A lot of what society pumps out in the media is not beautiful to me, yet it is the standard to which today's women are held to. So what is true beauty? Who defines it? That is what I want to explore with this blog, as well as providing a place for women to discuss the issues they face with self esteem and body image, and hopefully a place to show women that beauty is changing and fickle. Together, we can find our own beautiful and embrace it.
The day I happened in for a visit, my friends and I were greeted by the cemetery's superintendent who shared both his devotion to maintaining the memory of these fallen soldiers and his gratitude to France and her people for their longstanding support of the U.S. from its very origins. He also mentioned that he would like nothing better than for visitors and residents alike to come out to the site.

They also tattooed and cut themselves in various patterns, possibly as a way of identification or to inspire fear in their enemies.
Mr. C and I have already decided that places like Disney World are strictly verboten until we can get some culture into our kids... and satisfy our own world travel needs, but mostly because we believe a trip to, say, Scotland or England or one of the other 25 countries of our dead ancestors would better serve our family than a trip to the happiest place on earth. That and we don’t feel like dropping thousands on a trip where the most fun our children will have will be at the hotel pool. Although, that will probably happen anyway, the ungrateful brats. What was I saying?
You can surely guess where this is heading...
It was one of those rare “flying pig” moments. I was reading a book and beginning to feel a bit sleepy — it was late in the evening — and my wife, sitting in another corner of the living-room had the TV tuned to the late news on Danish Broadcasting Company (DR).

On Thursday afternoon Adi came home with her friend N as her parents requested us to pick up the kid. Both of them spent the afternoon at home, exploring Adi’s long touched toys, playing board games, watching Alvin and the Chipmunks and I was working from home watching over them. Around 4pm I asked the girls if they want to visit the nearby library. They agreed provided I promise to treat them with pizza. So, after mutual agreement we spent a good one hour at library. Adi was happy to find the latest Magic tree house book # 47 “Abe Lincoln At Last” and settled with it, N settled with few reading books and myself with “Palace of Illusions” on my Kindle. I was determined to finish it on that day and did finish it at 1am . I know I know I must be the last one in the blog world to read this book but I deserve a pat on my back as at last I pulled myself to stay up late to finish the book rather I couldn’t really put it down. It was mesmerizing to read about all those familiar characters again especially Karna though some details were contradicting to what I knew about the epic. The very next night I watched the age old tamil film “Karna” and listened to this song at least hundred times so far to quench my thirst. I have not got over it yet. The song sung by Krishna when Karna is at his death bed at Kurukshetra war. Krishna sings this song praising Karna’s qualities and the fate of his life.

So we are happy. And we (and by we I mean finally me) are finding we can even get stuff done in the house from time to time. I have spent a lot of my time trying to put some finishing touches on our house that we have now been in 6 years. Though I must admit, just when I was having the perfect balance in my life, I found myself as the brownie leader for Kaitlyn and Mackenzie's new brownie troop. I have learned that I have a lot to learn and though it is rewarding it is also quite time-consuming, at least for now.
And since I wore you out with explaining about the exciting in's and out's that are my childs' toilet habits or explaining to you my irrational fears of holding the lives of two people at once in my hands and scared to death of all of the shit that can happen when having said baby, I'll leave you with a few funnies:

I strongly suggest that you compare the two for yourself side-by-side to see the subtlties, since my scanner makes the glossy look better than it does in real life.
Are we any better? No, not really. But I certainly hope to be part of a growing movement among Secularists, Humanists and Atheists (among others) to be just that. We get our morality from empathy and reciprocity – selfish I know, but looking out for others in simple and great ways really works in shaping how others view you and treat you. It’s a positive feedback loop that really connects us to one another. That, and because some of us know (and I hope more of us are learning); who in the world wants fries.. with their salt?
This book makes me proud, and though I’m fairly certain how the stories will end, as I move toward the last pages, I’m as excited to read as I am when I find a good novel. I want to know what happened to the characters and what events bring them to the end of their journeys—and, that’s what I want from any good book.

And after an initial flirtation with democracy, Russia under Vladimir Putin seems to have moved towards Fascism too. And there is no doubt that, like Hitler, Mussolini and Peron, Putin is personally popular with his people. So the personality cult that tends to characterize all authoritarian regimes (whether Fascist or Communist) would already seem to be developing again in Russia. As a much more modern regime than Mussolini's however, we cannot expect Putin's Russia to have all the features of Fascist Italy. Mussolini's regime was a product of the ideas that were popular in his time and Putin's regime will undoubtedly gain approval in a similar way. As was pointed out at the beginning of this article, all Fascist regimes have features peculiar to themselves so in the end the only really common components of Fascism are nationalism combined with the paternalistic and authoritarian "we will look after you" undertaking that is basic to Leftism. Russia already has the national pride so just a bit more paternalism will make Russia clearly Fascist too. Fascist regimes do however allow considerable economic liberties and the example of China has shown that even a little liberty in the economic sphere can have remarkably transformative effects. So a Fascist Russia should be capable of considerable economic advancement for its people and thus will almost certainly be a much more relaxed regime than Soviet Russia. If economic progress in Russia is stifled under Putin, however, we could see the more dismal future outlined here.
A quick disclaimer: Shortly prior to receiving Reading the Psalms as an Auburn Fan, I read Unleashing the Scriptures by Stanley Hauerwas. In the book, Hauerwas argues that the primary reading of Scripture is a communal one, that the Bible is first and foremost the Scripture of the Church, used for the building of the Kingdom of God and not, as both fundamentalists and historical-critics have been wont to do, an instrument to find some kind of hidden meaning that can be applied to one’s life for an end goal or means. (As you can infer, Hauerwas takes his sharp-tongued axe to the doctrine of sola scriptura.) I say all this to say that these ideas had been rolling around in my head for a few days before receiving Reading the Psalms and can and will probably come across in my review of Nomel’s work. This is not a bad or good thing, but rather my attempt at transparency.
After a few minutes of silent running, James and his brother and sister started seeing the sea elves. Obeying Prince Alexander’s order to leave the island with dignity was impossible, and there was quite a bit of desperation in even the eyes of the bravest. Most of the large ships were already sailing out of the harbor, and many of the elves would not fit onto the remaining boats.

To say I don't like fish is kind of an overstatement. It's more that I'm just insanely particular about the kind, origin, and preparation. I really only like a few varieties of fish; cod (baked or grilled), mahi-mahi (grilled only), salmon (wood smoked, please), lake perch and walleye (breaded and fried, please, with a side of buttered rye bread and sliced onion). That's it, though. And I'm even picky when it comes to those. I think the reason, primarily, is because we live in the middle - nowhere near an oceanic coast where the fish are fresh (with the exception of the fresh water variety I mention - kinda surrounded by some pretty Great lakes and a load of tributaries here). Nearly all the fish available in my area have been frozen at some point for an undetermined amount of time, and have needed to travel a ridiculously lengthy distance to get here. Some are even caught off North American shores, but then sent to China for processing (I mean...what?!). By the time that fish reaches my grocery store, it's just not fresh enough for me to even consider buying, and in some cases, the odor assaults right through the package. The fish available in "the middle" isn't even close to comparable to the fish caught and served fresh in the coastal areas.

Writing a blog also gave me a great opportunity to meet people who have the same interest as I do – horseback riding. One of the reasons for creating the blog was to find out why people like horseback riding? I was astonished to hear so many different reasons. Some people horseback ride in order to relax and feel the connection with nature, while others enjoy the adrenalin rush during fast riding. As for me, I enjoy horseback riding, because it is a great exercise not only for your muscles, but also for the mind, because the most important thing in horseback riding is to understand the horse beneath you so that you can achieve something together.

Mrs. Stanton had come to warn Mom that her husband was going to kill Dad; that he sat at his window every single night with his shotgun resting on the sill, waiting for Dad to pass by on the road as he headed home after working on the house he'd bought and was rebuilding for us. After this warning, one of us kids was allowed to accompany Dad each evening.

Whenever I see these #draping photos I tend to think about a now classic study of dominance and submissive postural stances conducted by Larisa Tiedens of Stanford University. In the research, Tiedens and Fragle (2003) sought to determine whether people take on dominant or submissive postural stances, when reacting to the dominant or submissive posture of others. Would people pose dominantly when faced with other dominant postures, thereby escalating a competition for status within an interaction? Or alternatively, would people take on submissive postures when faced with dominance, to diffuse possible tension in the interaction?

I especially started to see the difference promoting a blog or any other kind of publication for that matter on Twitter when I was chosen to launch a new branch of a nationally published online magazine at MSU and the first things in my launch packet were to set up a Twitter and a Facebook page. Social media, along with a few hundred flyers, was my main source of getting this branch off the ground and get people to not only be a part of my writing staff but to also get people to read our content once I figured that first part out. Because, isn’t traffic to your magazine, blog, or news site the main point here anyways?

After that Kathy and I found the cute little train/trolley to Arashiyama. I’ve never been there and I wanted to see the bamboo paths. There are many temples and shrines (of course), some of which are UNESCO sites. The town was also PACKED with jr. high and high school kids, and other tourists, Japanese and foreign. And it was raining all day. But it was a very beautiful area in the northwest of Kyoto. And they had a nice mix of sakura (cherry) and matcha (green tea) soft ice cream. We also had noodles for lunch while we chatted with some students.

FH: November I’d start with bills (in conjunction with the treasurer) and write thank you letters to numerous people involved with the programming. Then I deal with the events that were proposed too late to be used but are interesting enough to be considered for next year's. Some are an immediate ‘Yes’ but others need to be debated by committee. I get a massive amount of enquiries. I have to tell some of them to come back to me mid-February or mid-January, and then we’ll talk, and then the programme committee goes through them. A lot of this has to be filed.
On Friday, I had the pleasure not only of sampling a five-year vertical flight of Roots Epic Ale, but speaking at length with Craig Nicholls. It's been a long time since I've checked in with Craig, and in the meantime, I've been hearing lots of reports of troubles at the brewery (poor service at the pub, drastically declining tap handles around town, a management change). It was good to finally hear a horse's-mouth report.
The Celilidh lager (how the hell you pronounce that I don’t know) combines Czech hop, Belgian malt, German yeast & Scottish water to brew a delicious palatable and wonderfully neck able bottle of lout. Top stuff. I had 2 bottles to go at and they slipped down like a dream. Delicious lagery goodness. It has a crisp citrusy quality, light on the hops with a dominate malt sweetness. Not bad at all. 4.7% and hit the spot. A quality lout.

Anyhow – this Sunday I went to go see the local minor league game at a real life baseball stadium. I apologize if I am using terms incorrectly. It should be clear by now that I have no idea what I’m talking about when it comes to sporting events. All I knew, was that I wanted a hot dog and a beer – and I wanted to sit down, eat my hot dog and drink my beer while there was baseball being played. Easy enough.

Except for sitting there, looking at him, refusing to let him sleep on our couch, which just felt so cruel and horrible in the moment.
Remember that you have a right to remain silent — about your phone and anything else. If questioned by police, you can politely but firmly ask to speak to your attorney.

Yesterday I had a customer walk up to me and say that she had been to our location before with the same problem and they were not able to fix it. Then she said that she called our tech support tier 3 over the telephone and was on the line with them for 2 hours and they were unable to help. So I said to her “well, you haven’t dealt with me yet.” I tell her what I am about to do to fix the problem and she tells me that they already did that at my location and that tech support tier 3 walked her through it also and it would not work. I did it anyway. And of course it worked. She asked me how I did it. I said “I’m the wizard.”
They appeared to be waiting to meet and have their photo taken with this woman who I didn't recognise at all. I thought I would take her photo anyway, as she is obviously well known to some people and so I would just have to find out who she was.
“As a resident of Grand County for 40 years, and as a father who wants his children and their children to experience the same natural wonders that I’ve enjoyed here over the years, I am deeply appreciative of the unified effort from our commissioners and staff in their fight to save our rivers and lakes,” said Kirk Klancke, president of the Colorado River Headwaters Chapter of TU. “I am proud of my county for having courageous leaders like these, who are an example to all of the Davids that are facing Goliaths.”
It was a visually stunning realisation of a book that just begged to be made into a film.
so, i have been playing with this fun, new machine, and loving it.
This shows how one must sacrifice some to gain some. A lesson in life we all have to learn early in life.
After church I ran my errands and picked up a coffee cake for my two best friends coming over. One friend caught the crud and was too sick to come. :( My other friend was able to come though. She is my friend who is the interior decorator. She got to see the results of our shopping trip. She loved it! She thought the house looks amazing! She gave me a few more helpful hints, which I got really excited about. Particularly since the ideas involved stuff I already have. She is such a super person and so wise. We got to sit down and have a really profound conversation. She is so wise and I just have so much respect for her.
The Fault In Our Stars is really a close second to Peony in love. It was purely, amazingly, brilliant.

This is a question of Buffalo Wild Wings responsibility when it runs popular promotions but fails to provide adequate security. Gun control is the much larger issue involved with this particular incident, and I have been a firm supporter of national legislation to deal with this problem.

Most of us get caught up in dreams. I think dreams and aspirations are great. But I am only human and can only see my plans not God's. I don't always know what is best. I just know what I want. So why is it that we are so willing to put everything on the line for our dreams? Follow your dreams everyone says! If you want it bad enough you can get it. Have you ever stopped to ask what God wants. Is my dream the same as God's plan?
They announce the winner of the presidential election on the 23rd of October. This country is over-due for a change and the people are desperate for it. If the president claims to have won the election again, I fear there might be uprisings, like Egypt, Libya or Tunisia. Only time will tell......

Rather than discover that the whole thing to now has been a waste of time because I can't pull it off, I don't go near it at all; better to teach well in the morning or write a little funny on Twitter than to do that.
She's a little happier looking than her BFF, Hester. Or maybe she's just laughing because her little owl tickled her ear with his feathers. She has the required wart or two on her face, and her jowls and extra chins show her age. I wanted to get the chin and jowls just right, so I used a mirror to check her face against mine for accuracy! If you click on the photo you can tell that her tongue is obscurring the lower teeth... or maybe there aren't any there?

Ray was a racist. He plotted and planned a murder for months. He literally stalked Dr. King across the South, all the while planning his murder. Sides gives us more of the day by day travelogue of Ray, and less of the “what’s in this guy’s head that makes him a murderer,” but the detail is astonishing nonetheless. From a bizarre trip to get a nosejob to strange encounters in brothels, Ray was obviously deranged, yet smarter than the average murderer.
As a Sales Rep, whether you sell insurance, real estate or a commodity how much do you know about the products being offered by your competition? Do you know what your clients are comparing you with? If not, invest some valuable time in research. Investing a day or two visiting the competition with the eyes of a shopper just might amaze you. You may readily see a weakness in their product or service that you will then use as a strong selling point in your presentations. You also may find a weakness in yours. Either way, you’ve learned information critical to the success of your sales.
A peek into our dining room built in. I designed it to match the style of the kitchen cabinets. The window above is at an awkward height, but it is a dark room, so I didn't want to close it in. I love how this turned out. It displays my inherited china and glassware so beautifully. It has a lot of needed storage too.
- it messes them up too much. So I'll have to pull out the old ones that hurt my feet.
Coconut Cake traditionally has a cream cheese frosting but since I am dairy free, I have made a homemade vanilla frosting with no milk and covered the entire cake is sweet shredded coconut flakes. Definitely a snowball cake

There is a certain possessiveness inherent within otaku culture that is especially unforgiving towards female idols and seiyuu, and how much latitude they have in presenting themselves. Like a number of things, it’s about image built around a cult of personality. Should a female with a notable, established reputation make, for instance, a sudden wedding announcement or express an interest in moving on to other things, or, God forbid, do something not seiyuu/anime-related that indicates they in fact are real people with outside interests, the results can be ugly. Even before the scandal, Aya was unfortunately already well-acquainted with this side of otakudom. In fact, a female seiyuu/idol can even be crucified for events in her distant past, even before she came to prominence. Such was the case with Miyamura Yuko, seiyuu of EVA‘s Soryu Asuka Langley, whose career was more or less destroyed after fans recognized her from an old, amateur AV.

This is how it happened with me.
I've seen it on a few men's faces too, but the asymmetric nature of tango means it's less likely. The ladies are often better dancers than the gentlemen. The boys usually have more choice of partner than the girls. The leaders have more control over where they're going than the followers. But it happens.
And one night in June some 50 years ago he and his misfit squad got the chance to prove him right…or wrong!
I finished the second page in my art journal using some more of the images from Debrina Pratt's Land Of Enchantment collage sheets, which are now being carried at Retro Cafe Art Gallery. I did a couple more image transfers onto some vintage math flash cards. I did a gel medium transfer and again, I find that these images really transfer well. I'm going to order some more to play with because I'm so in love with how well they transfer!
Three months of hard work later, I moved up to Brazil. The southern hemispheric summer had made Buenos Aires an unbearable, windless 40C (105F), and the beach was looking pretty attractive. Three months of that, and I was motoring.
The 115 oz can is always 4¢ per ounce. I know that, by buying the larger can, I always get the sale price on ketchup. We divide that big can into 6 pint jars and store in the fridge until we need them. We do this about twice a year and it keeps just fine in the jars. If I can get to Sam's Club, that same size can is 2¢ an ounce -even more savings. At that price, if some gets wasted I'm less concerned because the whole pint jar only cost us 32¢.
Let me first of all say, that we do the “hate group” map and the counts, and so on, as a very rough measure… I’m not talking about the individual towns and such… as an attempt to get a feel for what the Radical Right looks like. Is it growing? Is it shrinking? And so on.

The top of the packaging is clear plastic. I love this with a lipstick because you can see the true color. When shopping for a drugstore lipstick this is major, most of the time you end up picking a lipstick based on the color of a sticker. Which is never the true color.

While I was in town today, I did buy a few little Valentine's bits and pieces to decorate a little bit of my living room. I've read many blogs from some extremely clever ladies who decorate their rooms with seasonal arts and crafts as the seasons change and I thought, "What a good idea!" But I'm just starting off small, so here are a couple of pictures

A while back I heard about a guy named, Sasha Dichter, who directs the innovative non-profit Acumen fund. Dichter has investors all over the world pouring resources into parts of India, Pakistan and East Africa where the average income is less than $4 per day. They have a goal to make 100 million in investments, touching 50 million lives.
