After dinner he wanted to snuggle and read, just him and I. He tore back the covers on my bed and we read books covered in coziness. Even when Daddy and Oldest were heard outside playing football, he wanted to stay a few minutes longer.

Here is an example (and great story) from Zappos.com. A customer checked into a hotel in Las Vegas and forgot to pack her shoes that she bought on Zappos for the trip. She called to order another pair and have them shipped to her overnight. Unfortunately, they were out of stock – most companies would have very politely said they would inform her the moment the shoe became available – Zappos did not. Instead they had an employee go out and find the shoe at a local mall and then delivered it to her hotel; all free of charge!
I was pleased to learn that Rachel Ashwell herself would be present for a book signing in just a few days, so I discussed with the staff my desire to return for the signing, meet Rachel, take photos, and do a story. The staff was extremely amenable, befitting my entire experience there. I was given a green light, and so, with cameras in tow, I returned last night for the small happening. It amazes me how so many such fetes with notables are going on concurrently in New York City.
The BP oil spill will cause immeasurable harm to those immediately affected by it, the beaches, the tourism, and the fishing industry of the states where the oil is washing up. There is no way, nor reason, to minimize that. Keep in mind, however, the well will be capped. The cleanup will continue. The wildlife will return. The spill will become history.

Over the years, I’ve learned to ignore my instincts somehow. To ignore my inner voice and the red flags causing this panic. It’s just coffee. He didn’t mean it as a date–it’s not dinner or anything. You could use someone to talk to lately. Or as a well-meaning friend added: “You deserve a life, too.”
I mentioned that I arrived at the show late. It runs from 10 a.m.-4 p.m., but I almost always get there around 12:30-1 p.m. That's so I can avoid the big mob scene for whoever is signing autographs that day. (Yesterday it was former Syracuse great Floyd Little. I care nothing about SU, and yes, I know Little's history).
To conclude, this book is really good. The twists and turns all the way through make it seem like a much longer book, and make it much better. Four and a half out of five stars.

This sucks. Bye bye pretty hands.
I think about the space that is created after a loved one has passed away. They are gone, but not gone, as their memories are still so close, so vivid. They continue to exist in a space between life and death. I do not believe in an after-life, a heaven, but rather that we return to the earth, the universe, that we become part of all that is around us. And so our loved ones are gone, but also here, part of the natural spaces around us, and always in our hearts. I think, also, about the pain of grief, of learning to live with that loss, to realize that there is no “getting over” or “moving on” from a death, but that over time the pain gets easier to carry. It does not become less, but it becomes easier to bear, less likely to cut so deeply.

The One S camera is quite capable. In fact, you’ll probably really like the images you capture with it. At the same time, I wouldn’t say the camera is all that good at keepin’ it real, if you know what I mean. Colors seem to be saturated and brightened to make images more beautiful, especially yellows and reds.
Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Spread peanut butter onto crackers, cover with another cracker to make a sandwich. Line the cracker sandwiches on the cookie sheet. Melt butter and brown sugar together, bring to a boil and cook for 2-3 minutes. Pour the caramel onto the cracker sandwiches. Break up the chocolate bars and scatter over the caramel. Allow to sit for a few minutes to let the chocolate melt. Spread the melted chocolate over the caramel layer. Cool, break up into pieces and eat.

I didn’t sleep too well that first night, and was up about 6am sitting on a deserted beach. The solitude was magical, it was just the sort of place I’d dreamed of walking Harry, but never did. Think what you may, but to this day I’m convinced I felt him leaning against me while I sat there, perhaps we did finally walk that beach together.

Most of the van parks are all 10-15min out of the centre of Darwin so we did not get a chance to see the city. It was after 4pm when we got to the park so just set up and then a sit around. Jordy rode his trike around the park. Just had risotto for dinner in the rice cooker. Bloody hot and muggy! We thought it might have been cooling down cos we've had some nicer nights recently but i guess those extra hundred km north to the coast has not helped. Went to bed with the air con on all night.
St. Paul tolerated the social norms of the civilization (if we can call it that by today’s western standards) he lived in. Whether St. Paul personally approved of slavery, human trafficking or the savagery of war during his time doesn’t matter; ethics is ultimately a personal decision a person can practice. The question of whether secular morality would approve of things such as human cloning is a pointless one because, ultimately, society will have its social norms that may not be consistent with either secular or non-secular morality – because these ethical and moral standards are, again, ultimately personal. What we do as a collective defines society but what society does, and what we personally decide to do within that collective, doesn’t define us. If it did, St. Paul would arguably be a monster.
He said, first, that if these artificial means were to spread,

I have to admit, though, that I grabbed it off the library end cap on a whim. I'm on a Mommy-Memoir kick (in case you haven't noticed) and so it appealed to me. I hesitated, though when I saw that Amie is a lesbian. Not because I was turned off by the concept, but because I wasn't sure if I could relate. But I did. I can. I think that any human who has tried, succeeded, considered, is considering, and/or may one day bring another human into their life will relate.

He bucked, thrusting himself further into her mouth. Her tongue flattened out, licking him in broad strokes from base to head. His fingers tangled into her hair, holding her steady while he fucked her face. Her cheeks caved as she increased the suction. Swirling her tongue as he thrust, she could tell he was ready to explode. When it came to fucking her, he could go for hours, but for some reason, with blow jobs he turned back into a pre-pubescent teenage boy and was quick to come.

(Now, I'll be a little bit of a skeptic and question whether this is really a good way to determine best brewpub. It was obviously designed to give geographic representation across the nation, and doesn't acknowledge that there is a huge concentration of great brewpubs in the Pacific Northwest and California. To make an analogy with my favorite sport, track & field, the only reason the long-distance races in the Olympics aren't 100% Kenyan and Ethiopian is that each nation is restricted to three entries each. If Chow really wanted an elite field, about half of these entries would have been from Portland alone. And as one of the commenters on that page noted, where in the heck is northern California's Russian River? That said, I nonetheless love NXNW and think it's deserving of your vote.)
Mary Anne Osborne, in a guest blog for Sage HR, warns us of the risks of age profiling. She states “But of key concern here is not letting externally perceived notions of generational tendencies cloud judgment of character.” The danger of making assumptions about a person based solely on their generational group can lead to costly mistakes in hiring and training.

Death before or during a scheduled flight may qualify someone for a partial refund, according to Spirit’s website.

We are lucky to be born in this beautiful country, where, love is the essence of life. We are lucky to be citizens of world’s largest democracy. We need to appreciate this fact more and incorporate a little discipline in our everyday lives. This is our time, we can build the India of tomorrow by just going an extra mile. It is not that great a price to pay for the rewards we will reap.
The molten core has an inner iron core about the size of the moon, whose temperatures are more akin to the heat of the sun. Surrounding it is an outer fluid iron core. Magma convection currents rise and sink to the surface and then back as they cool and then reheat. This magma surrounds the iron core that is spinning and as such acts like the copper windings around an electric generator. As a result, the Earth resembles something of a giant magnet with two poles: magnetic north and magnetic south. Massive electric currents, called electromagnetic induction, flow between these positive and negative poles and become the hidden source for the magnetic field that surrounds our earth and continuously regenerates that field.

Monkey: Journey To The West will be a re-working of the ancient Chinese legend Journey to the West. Albarn will write the score while Hewlett will design the set and costumes. The show will also feature 45 Chinese circus acrobats, Shaolin monks and Chinese vocalists, and will be performed at the Palace Theatre.

Ants are attracted to the seeds of certain species of spring bloomers because the seeds bear small protruberances called elaiosomes. These elaiosomes contain fatty food, attractive oils, and possibly sugars, and are considered to be a tasty treat if you are an ant. The ants carry the seeds into their nests, sometimes as far away as 70-75 yards, where they dine on this gourmet meal. But the seed shells are too hard to penetrate, and are cast off in an unused tunnel. Here, protected amid the nutrients in the soil, the seeds will germinate.
Indeed, boorish behaviour such as Komphela’s is counterproductive; it actually hinders transformation. Quotas, in fact, are a prime example of the law of unintended consequences. When players are selected, not on merit, but because of the colour of their skin, to meet a quota that is set arbitrarily, both the players and the fans know it. Hence the honourable refusal, for instance, of Charl Langeveldt to accept selection for the Proteas ahead of André Nel simply in order to increase the ratio of players of colour in the side. Conversely, when such individuals — the Ashwell Princes, the Makhaya Ntinis, the Brian Habanas — are selected on merit, they receive as much support and applause as anyone else.

Ireland is wasting time and energy worrying about “efficiency,” “saving money,” “teacher pay,” and battles over the Junior and Leaving Certs, instead of investing in imagining, and moving towards, a lifespan educational structure which will carry Ireland into the future. In this, this nation is hardly alone, but perhaps the stakes are much higher for a small island nation which knows the ability of education to transform a society, which saw the changes of the 1970s and 1980s, in all

Asian markets surged during the quarter, led by the stellar performance of Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index. The 19.26% three month-return for the Nikkei was its strongest quarterly performance since 1988. However, a falling yen in relation to the Canadian dollar reduced returns in Canadian terms to 8.6%. Japanese stocks rose as economies of the country’s trading partners improved, the country’s central bank eased monetary policy and investors bought shares they perceived as undervalued.

The SCAF, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, is the military ruling power in Egypt. SCAF proposed an amendment that “the SCAF would remain in power for six months starting last April, with the option of extending the transitional phase by another three months” (Tarek) which was passed by a large majority of the Egyptian people. However, SCAF has repeatedly offered empty promises to step down and succeed executive authority to a civilian council and has now been in power for almost a year. The current status as determined by the Muslim Brotherhood is that power will be transferred in June (Tarek). Throughout the region, many countries have instated parliaments and elections, but “the parliaments have few powers and elections are controlled to ensure that a ruler or a particular party is reseated” (Pulsipher and Pulsipher 249). Though SCAF has shown to be reluctant in handing over power, there are those who are optimistic, such as Naglaa, a woman protesting in Tahrir, who, when asked whether or not SCAF will hand over power in June, states that she has “…no doubts they will do this. We think the demands of the revolution are being met: for example, we just had our first free and open parliamentary elections” (Trew). Though the military and the Muslim Brotherhood retain authority of the government, the Egyptian people feel optimistic that, come June, power will be handed over to civilian control.

Commitment is a pretty personal thing. What’s easy for one person can be excruciatingly difficult for someone else. So I decided to break it down by — a) stuff you may not have known about before, but that really doesn’t require any lifestyle changes – b) stuff that requires some lifestyle change or financial commitment — and c) those things that require not only more effort, but possibly a complete change of lifestyle.

Nontheless, I found myself in a ball of tears last night. I was lamenting my troublesome pregnancies and my debilitating TMJ. I don't think I've shared on my blog yet that I suffer from really painful TMJD which causes my jaw to lock up on me at a moments notice. It has made feeding myself and my baby the last few weeks really hard. I feel broken and useless, like nothing can be easy. Last night was my breaking point. We all have ours don't we? That's when that song came into my head.
I realize more and more every day how affectionate you really are and I'm soaking every second of you up.

We reconnected in 1998 when John again asked for Braille instruction because by this time he had lost so much vision that he could no longer read his print lecture notes.

Pine wilt is caused by beetles carrying pine wood nematodes vomiting them into the water-carrying vessels of the tree (xylem). The tree senses the nematodes and essentially blocks water to those branches. Often you will observe a branch then perhaps a side of the tree and eventually complete death of the tree within 6-9 months. While I have diagnosed many samples of pine wilt, more often when I visit homeowners the tree problems are due to fungal diseases which occur on the needles. If you look closely at your needles and observe dark bands or rings on them followed by death of the needle either direction from the band, the tree problem is most likely due to a fungal needle blight like dothistroma in Austrian and Ponderosa pines or brown spot in Scotch pines. They can all be prevented by spraying a fungicide containing copper sulfate in the spring.

On the end closest to the kitchen there is a side table that collects mail and receipts. It was no surprise to find a piece of junk mail and a couple of old receipts under that end of the couch. There were two hair rubber bands that I use for ponytails – not sure how they ended up under there – and a business card (mine). I expected to find the couple of pieces of lightweight paper trash, but there weren’t any random coins or other objects that can slide through. Those could still be trapped inside the couch, I guess.

Iain Macleod who became Colonial Secretary, who is infamous for rushing de-colonisation through and causing many problems had a booklet “One World” published by Conservative Central Office in1960 the same year Prime Minister Harold MacMillan made his Winds of Change speech to the South African Parliament in Pretoria. The present Utopia is the coffee coloured, Multi-Racial society with the free movement of peoples as cheap labour. Norman Pannell, patriotic Liverpool Conservative MP, urged a practical approach to immigration at the 1958 and 1961 Conservative conferences suggesting immigrants have health checks and those who are criminal be deported. In 1958 Home Secretary RAB Butler agreed with him but did nothing. At the 1961 conference Colonial Secretary Iain Macleod countered Pannell at a fringe meeting declaring his utopian belief in the brotherhood of man.

Herrnstein did a lot of traveling in 1966. After only 4 games with the Phillies, he was traded to the Cubs on April 21st in the infamous Ferguson Jenkins deal.

One of our writing group members suggested watching a TED Talk by Dan Gilbert on happiness. I was really struck by how his research supports the original definition of contentment. Dan talks about how much happier people are with their choices when they think they are stuck with them. According to Dan, we have a psychological immune system that works best when we are stuck. It allows us to become content with how things are and it actually changes our preferences to match what we already have. This is SO cool! As Socrates said, “Contentment is natural wealth, luxury is artificial poverty.” Our psychological immune system keeps us rich.

The idea was to do what the Session Beer Project is all about: stimulate discussion. I got up there, talked about what session beer was and wasn't, and why I set my ABV number at 4.5% -- and why I was reluctant to set a limit -- and what session beer was and wasn't in the U.S., and how I'd be happy with another, better name for it, and ways to make session beer interesting (cask being a big one, of course)...and it was all stuff they pretty much knew, although the parts about how well session-strength beers are selling around Philly seemed to make them pretty happy.
The principle of The Shout is fairly straight forward. You buy yourself and your mate a beer. When you have finished your beers, your mate buys a beer for himself and one for you, in return. If there are more than just you and your mate in The Shout, then the beer total needs to be adjusted accordingly. The number of beers bought in each Shout is equal to the number of drinkers in The Shout. Simple. But, like most things in life, The Shout has traditions and responsibilities that must not be messed with.

However, if you can’t make it tonight, there are plenty of other excellent beers to try over the next couple of days. Last night saw the launch of Venus Gold. You can read about its genesis here but suffice it to say that this was simply stunning. A 3.8% that was beautifully aromatic and packed so full of Stella and Galaxy hops that it left drinkers gasping for more. A gallon barely did it justice. Get it while you can.

I followed this with a chicken curry from the Japanese food stall. It was quite nice (although £5 is obviously dearer than anything that comes in a tray really should be, irrespective of quality). This fortified me sufficiently to tramp back over to Boxxxxxxxed, for Iconaclass, which is your man from Dälek’s more traditionally styled hip-hop act. I initially enjoyed a bit of heavy-bass boom-bap, but left when we hit a turntablism section that looked like it wouldn’t ever end (come on now, it’s no morally superior to a guitar solo). Tony Conrad was on in Space 2, and I know he’s very influential and all the rest of it but I nevertheless found myself faced with a distorted violin solo that looked like it wouldn’t ever end and so began to wonder if we’d hit that point in the weekend. Suspicions were confirmed when I moved on to the Old Library and found Cut Hands doing sampled drum solo that looked like it wouldn’t ever end.

As not only a fan of Japanese animation and comics, I also have a profound interest in Japanese history so I certainly love a good series that takes place in a time when samurais roam the streets of an impressive city then called Edo. Of course, this means I have seen my share of anime and read more than enough manga titles that take place in this fascinating period so imagine my complete delight when I heard that NIS America was bringing the anime version of Natsume Ono’s critically-acclaimed manga. Oh yeah, the Premium Edition of the Complete Series of House of Five Leaves is everything a fan of the series could ask for and one that shouldn’t be missed.

So, a leading multi-billion Dollar SPE is being run for years without any accounts or proper oversight. That operation is plainly in breach of clauses 18, 19 and 20 of the HDC Act and yet the silence is eloquent.

In those few national-security areas where Obama does his homework, a second characteristic predominates: He simply does not see much occurring internationally that threatens American interests. Such a benign view of a chaotic world may be even more shocking than his general lack of interest, but it is yet another reflection of his underlying intellectual laziness. He is most politely described as credulous and inexperienced, especially for someone who lived overseas as a child. During both the 2008 campaign and his presidency, for example, Obama has downplayed the very concept of a "global war on terror," treated nuclear proliferation as a side issue, and ignored the enormous strategic threats posed by a rising China and a belligerent Russia. American decline, most recently reflected in S&P's downgrade of America's sovereign debt to France's level, is untroubling and even natural to him.

Some may argue that our relationship with these species has strayed more towards parasitism (one animal benefits at the expense of another), or even amensalism (one animal harms another without benefit to itself) with the invention of “factory farms” and over consumption. I would have to agree that in this current system of factory farming that we are not holding up our end of the mutualistic bargain, while these species are still providing us with a potent nutrient source. However it can be done well, and it is our ethical and evolutionary obligation to continue to do it well.

It’s a familiar story. In craft canning circles, the Oskar Blues brewery in Lyons, Colorado, functions nowadays as a combination of Fenway Park as Mecca for Red Sox fans, Robert Johnson’s recordings as templates for blues guitarists, and the Library of Congress to document enthusiasts. In 2002, Oskar Blues became the first American microbrewery to can its ale, two units at a time to begin, and entirely by hand. The reason: Canning lines intended for small scale craft usage had yet to be produced.
So since I can't buy any furniture until we get through the moving costs and do the necessary renovations (and pay our tax bill and repair our savings account), I'm spending my time obsessing over the floor plan and where and how I'll place our current furniture.

There is an epidemic going on in the Church today. Many Christians hold on to offenses and maintain a “me first” attitude. In this last season, we must learn how to have compassion, truly love each other, and become one as the Body of Christ. Anna Aquino’s book seeks to open our eyes, soften our hearts, and move us to extend blessings to one another as we come together in unity. This book will help heal the hearts of people—both in the Church and in the world—who have been hurt by the spirit of Balaam. You will:
"When we adults think of children, there is a simple truth which we ignore: childhood is not preparation for life; childhood is life. A child isn’t getting ready to live; a child is living. The child is constantly confronted with the nagging question, 'What are you going to be?' Courageous would be the youngster who, looking the adult squarely in the face, would say, 'I’m not going to be anything; I already am.' We adults would be shocked by such an insolent remark, for we have forgotten, if indeed we ever knew, that a child is an active participating and contributing member of society from the time he is born. Childhood isn’t a time when he is molded into a human who will then live life; he is a human who is living life. No child will miss the zest and joy of living unless these are denied him by adults who have convinced themselves that childhood is a period of preparation. How much heartache we would save ourselves if we would recognize the child as a partner with adults in the process of living, rather than always viewing him as an apprentice. How much we would teach each other… adults with the experience and children with the freshness. How full both our lives could be. A little child may not lead us, but at least we ought to discuss the trip with him, for after all, life is his and her journey too. – Professor T. Ripaldi, discovered via this blog post.

South Africa’s ‘can do attitude’ - in the trash: I remember the days when South Africans had national pride instead of national shame. When we could make anything happen with a bit of willpower. When South Africans had faith in each other, and when we would all band together for the ‘common good’. Now we are a weak nation. We whine and complain about things, but we no longer ‘make things happen’. This is because we have lost our faith in each other as human beings. In the huge battle for survival, everyone will step on anyone to stay ahead. There is no moral justification for this behaviour pattern. What changed? We can sit and blame the government, we can blame society, but the simple fact is that South Africa has been beaten down by our inaction when it came to things that piss us off. South Africa feels like we are held hostage by our political and business systems. In the ‘civilised’ world, people act when they are incensed by something the government does that is not in accordance with the will of the people. When government ministers are caught with their fingers in the till in the UK they are sent to prison. The people do not stand for things that bother them collectively. Sure, there is a politically correct mess in the ‘first’ world, but that’s here as well.

Perhaps the comparison to Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! is more apt than I’d first thought. Both films concern men who invent peculiar ideals for their lovers, and convince themselves that these women share their feelings. Talk to Her may be a somewhat more sober, mature exploration of this particular kind of obsessive love, but I think I prefer Tie Me Up! In the end, its lightness (along with the power of the female lead) renders the subject matter somewhat less disturbing.

With question four, it’s only my interpretation and not always true. Typically when you see your significant other’s family, you get a good feel for how he is raised and what values/morals he has. Word of caution though, we all do not turn out as our parents do. Everyone is their own person, so you have to just feel him out and see how he is. If he is as caring and compassionate as you say, then it doesn’t sound like he is going to go rogue and change based on your unplanned pregnancy. You said that he is always around and encouraging you. To me it doesn’t sound like he is going to ‘up and cheat’ on you just because you are pregnant.

In 2010 I turned this negative self talk around. Instead of telling myself I would try, I told myself I would do. Instead of hiding what I was doing, I told all those around me. Instead of telling myself I would fail, I told myself I would succeed. Instead of telling myself it was too hard, I told myself I can do anything I put my mind to and yes I am strong enough. It was all a mental game and just changing how I talked to myself was the difference between failure and success.

First, it’s assumed that all environmentalists are radical hippies. We all want to just live out in the woods and destroy society and practice some sort of pagan religion and dance naked on the ruins of Walmart. They believe we worship the earth and automatically worship Mother Nature over the stability of the economy or God (some seem to get those two mixed up a lot). Many conservatives don’t even use the word “environmentalist” without placing the word “radical” behind it. However, many of the people they claim to be “radical environmentalists” are not even “radical,” and some are not even environmentalists (Hint: Barack Obama). The truth is, many environmentalists are not radical. They would prefer to drive cars, live in the big city, and buy cheap socks at a giant department store. Did refusing to end Medicaid make George W. Bush a radical socialist? No, but somehow any act of environmental justice is seen as some sort of pagan anarchism. Many people understand that for their own good health and well-being, steps should be taken to reduce how much we ravage and ravish our one and only planet and pollute the air, water, and food of our fellow brothers and sisters. These steps do not have to be big or forced upon us by the federal government; it can be as simple as recycling, biking to school/work, voting locally on a moratorium against natural gas fracking, or protesting against a local coal plant.

As with Stoicism, we see the concentration on the present, and the “view from above.” This second exercise often has an ecstatic side to it, just as the concentration on the present can as well. Meditation on the present can lead to a sublime ecstasy of sorts, and is in many ways, for Hadot and others, simply the flip-side of the depersonalizing “view from above,” the attempt to become one with the cosmos or world. We are nothing more than parts of this whole, and to imagine differently is to distort our view of things. And since the world is so much more powerful, this distorted view will lead to unhappiness when the world doesn’t follow our distorted expectations.
In order to feel the heart of the piece, Ja the artist becomes an anti-editor who dismantles the work in order to edit away the paralytic parts of the piece. Writing seems more genuine whenever it feels involuntary. In Natalie Goldberg’s book Wild Mind: Living the Writer’s Life she says that “the underbelly of writing is nonwriting.” Goldberg talks about the censor, which says, don’t write that, that’s a crappy idea. This censor inhibits us, and disables us from writing what we truly think. This censor might have been created by our experiences—the parent who never believed in you, that teacher who thought you would never live up to his standards, or your peers who snickered when they read your first draft. These experiences leave individuals broken, yet what Ja the artist does is to remind me that I need to transcend my brokenness. She reminds me that I should write with an integral faith—faith in myself and a faith in my capacity to get better.

For those who despise Robert Moses - and there are many - the Gowanus Expressway, built under his auspices, could easily be the poster child for the dark side of urban development. Deterioration has only added insult to injury. It does provide a much needed connection between various boroughs and through Brooklyn, but at a very hefty price, particularly aesthetic. The highway as seen from street level is hideous, blocks light, and dominates the avenue. There have been talks and plans over the years of taking the elevated structure down and replacing it with a tunnel, but, to date, nothing has been decided.

In a medium frying pan, cook bacon until crisp. Remove to a plate and crumble when cooled. Meanwhile, cook the mushrooms and garlic in the same frying pan, using the fat from the bacon (you may wish to remove some of the fat before cooking if your bacon is very fatty). Sauté over medium heat until the garlic is golden and fragrant, and the mushrooms are lightly browned. Add the cooked spaghetti squash to the pan and cook until heated through. Remove the pan from the burner and stir in the beaten egg (it's important to stir the egg in immediately so that the heat from the spaghetti squash will cook the egg). Stir until the egg just becomes opaque and starts to stick to the spaghetti squash 'noodles'. Serve hot with a light dusting of parmesan cheese.
Rhododendron ‘Lemon Dream’ (‘Creamy Chiffon’ x R. degronianum ssp. degronianum ‘Exbury’) – A newer introduction which has garnered a lot of attention, ‘Lemon Dream’ features frilly pale lemon yellow blooms (occasionally double) in early to mid-May.

By 2.30am it became apparent than he didn’t want to leave, and she didn’t want him to leave either. But she was determined not to sleep with him. Still, he managed to convince her that they could just lie on the bed together and cuddle; they didn’t have to take their clothes off, they would just lie on the top of the bed – after all, they both had will-power, didn’t they? So they moved to her bedroom. Lying on top of the bed, they talked and talked into the early hours of the morning, until finally falling asleep in each other’s arms, fully clothed.

I underestimated the importance of that six months ago. I thought back then that the challenge of self-publishing was just about learning the “hows” of it (how to format, how to make a cover, how to advertise, etc.) And that once I had a handle on those things, I’d have a shot at making something of it.

harmonica solo to close out a savagely mutated Blowin' In The Wind that was inspired in its reinvention. All the way through, his singing was right there, on the money, and he toyed with the phrasing as if every utterance was a game of Blind Man's Bluff. Highlights? How about a gentle guitar-performed Girl From The North Country, or a brooding Man In The Long Black Coat? How about a word-perfect and meticulously enunciated Desolation Row, Bob's facial expressions pantomiming every line, or a banjo-laden Blind Willie McTell, or the nastiest, angriest Ballad Of A Thin Man that you are ever likely to hear? And if that is not enough, how about a song from the new album, the Midnight Special-esque 'If You Ever Go To Houston', perfromed for the second night in a row and for the second time ever?

This is a very interesting question in light of information I’ve just translated from a another blogger. According to this post which I translated from Bulgarian, the German High Command rejected the idea of creating a nuclear weapon in favor of research into rocketry. We know from history that it was the German V1 and V2 rocket programs that were the birth place of our modern space program here in the United States.

Despite being somewhat repulsed by that man’s need to touch Noel, and obvious lack of shame about the whole thing, in an instant I knew that I had to say hello and get a handshake myself. I just knew that somehow failing to get a handshake or an autograph would be a source of disappointment later. I stepped forward, thrust out my hand and said, “Noel, can I shake your hand!” He put out his small, cold hand and gave me a medium-grip shake. Immediately he turned to an autograph seeker and all I could think to say was, “High Flying Birds is the best album…” Then I got tongue tied. Noel finished the sentence for me. “Ever!” I gathered some wits and said, “It’s one of the best albums you’ve ever made!” meaning to include Oasis greats like Definitely Maybe.

Day 7 (the last one I will chronicle in detail, I promise): I have mixed feelings about this day. But, it started on a hilarious note. As we came to a stop in the town of Puerto Viejo, the bus door opened and a Rasta-man, with long dreads, a wife-beater and cargo-shorts hopped on. Kathy, one of the instructors on the trip, reared back (she looked scared), waved her hands and said, "No no! This isn't your bus!" the man laughed, and Maria introduced "Jupy" our guide for the day. I was in hysterics..... Laughed so hard, I could hardly breathe. Poor Kathy. She is still claiming that she was just notifying him that it wasn't a "public" bus.... I think he scared the shit out of her.

There are many many Muslim women who are happy to wear the burka, understand the freedom it gives them, understand the respect it gives them, as opposed to the non-Muslim culture of exploiting women and living a life that is seemingly ‘free’ and ‘liberal’.

First, there is a pretty nifty scene where Frank uses a firehose to beat the living tar out of a bunch of gun-toting bad guys. It's a Jackie Chan sort of scene, although I suspect much of it is done with computer animation and clever editing rather than actual props. Unfortunately, the climax of the scene completely breaks continuity with the entire fight that proceeded.

The virus, and the film, move on understanding. Currently unknown English words (although ones pertaining to love and hate, most beloved hot-buttons of infotainment, are early favorites) carry a new sort of virus, one that takes hold in the ephemeral moment when someone not just hears the word but understands it. (It’s reasonable to suspect that this will not be one of evolution’s fortunate mutations, as a successful word virus would be more like William S. Burrow’s conception of the written word as a symbiotic virus that made speech possible, not one that invariably led to its host eating all other potential hosts and then exploding.) What then? If Burroughs is right, we can’t halt our internal vocalisation, and that inevitably spills out verbally, possibly carrying the fatal virus and delivering that letter to anyone near you, or listening at home.
Have a great day.

Her dog no longer sports the bloated, pyknic physique she did a few weeks back.

After having stuffed up sinuses more days than not since last summer, I finally went into see an ENT doctor to see why I keep getting one sinus infection after another. As I expected, I have some lovely polyps taking up space in my sinuses and making me congested and susceptible to repeated infections, much like I did before my prior surgeries when I was 12 and 13. He is hopeful we can kick this thing in the butt with a burst of prednisone for 2-3 weeks and some antibiotics to shrink the polyps, thus hopefully making me feel better and preventing another surgery. Yes, that would be much preferred.
Inside, the house is sparsely furnished with the few remaining original pieces, but apparently the National Trust will be sourcing additional items from the period. Meanwhile, it is easy to see the clean lines of the architecture. Most of the internal walls are white, with the addition of an occasional dramatic slab of blue or yellow. Lots of interesting shapes are created with the angle of the staircase, the presence of the odd curving wall, and the play of light and shade, and the spaces between the structures.
They are meticulously handmade and the finished quality is superb. They are made from sensual floral patterned lace and 100% silk satin trimmings and covered buttons.

By the light of Lido’s torch from the other side of the gate above he could see that there was another wide arched opening on the other side of the cave-like chamber that lead into another room of positively inky blackness. He looked around for his iron coin and finding it on the stone floor plunked it back into his pocket. He then bravely, and oh so quietly, made his way toward the dark gap. About half way there he decided to throw his coin through the archway into the darkness. He gave it a hefty toss, and it sailed far and then clattered ringingly along the stone floor. He paused, waited, and then began to pad silently toward the doorway again. Then he heard something inside the far room shift as though something large had moved. Then he heard a dull thud. Then another, and another. Something heavy was shambling through the black shadow of that chamber. Ishcandar stopped dead in his tracks and turned a pale shade of green. He immediately padded his way back to the base of the stairs, where he stopped and turned around again to face the dark archway. A huge hulking shape lumbered out from beneath the archway, as though stepping out of a nightmare. It stopped momentarily and stared at the little Hobbit across the stone floor.

Yes, the running is easy to not have any questions about, to feel secure and happy about.
8. Spotting opportunities and innovation: LE – “innovation is the key to Google’s success, everything Schmidt does revolves around creating more innovation. Without it, Schmidt believes there is nothing to prevent another company from overtaking Google as the king of digital information. Innovation is systematically encouraged at Google at all levels throughout the organization, including management. At Google, management follows the “70/20/10″ rule where seventy percent of their time is spent on core business projects, twenty percent is spent on projects related to the core business and ten percent is spent on projects unrelated to the core business (Battelle, 2005). Schmidt, in order to remain true to the 70/20/10 rule, actually divides these projects into different rooms and tracks his time spent in each of the rooms.” Courtesy Marty Andrade

Finally! I waited all week for my 'new' quilt. It finally came on Saturday! I put quotes on "new" because it is new for me but not new, new. I have looked and looked for a quality white quilt that I liked. Oh, yes, I found some but the prices are outrageous! I found this one on eBay - it is Pinecone Hill Victoria and sells for..... $430! Gasp! The lady I bought this from had it listed for $150. That was still too high for me. I mean, it's used after all. So, I emailed her and asked her if she would consider a 'Best Offer' option on her listing. She emailed back and said she would add it to the listing and $80 was her lowest price. Since her listing specifically said that it was in LIKE NEW condition, I agreed. That is still a lot for a used quilt in my opinion, but I really liked it and it was cheaper than any of the other options. (Ones I didn't like so well but were new.) So, here it is.

WIthout even thinking about it,whenever you read, you make the movie in your head. And it’s more than just seeing and hearing the character: when you’re really involved with what you’re reading, you even feel what the character is feeling. Have you ever closed a book and been surprised to find out that it was sunny outside, because it was dark winter inside the book? (Or the other way around?) That’s because when you read, you help the author create the story. The author tells you enough that you can fill in the blanks, and of course everyone fills in those blanks differently, depending on who they are and what’s going on in their lives.

In reading all this I can’t help but think that this is an exercise in locking down a major US city. And what comes next? Residents locked in their “units” like cattle, planes shot out of the air, riots? It’s called “soft Martial Law” I believe. An exercise in tyranny that is more appropriate for Soviet Russia than for the USA. This is just one more step on the road to tyranny in America. One more inch of growth in the looming police state! The powers that be including NATO seem to forget this is a nation with freedoms and rights and this is not Nazi Germany BORN AGAIN! None of this comes as a surprise really keeping in mind that after the fall of the USSR and after 9/11 the US hired the head of the East German Secret Police (the Stasi). That man is Markus Wolf hired by Homeland Security known as the “Silver Fox.” Wolf is dead now having died in 2006. This guy was a real piece of work. He managed to turn half the population in East Germany into informants and, thus, created an air of paranoia beyond astounding. His mission was to turn East Germany into one giant snitch state and he did just that while head of the Stasi. I assume he was hired for the same reason in the US to do the same thing.

Ann Lamott's Bird by Bird -- This is the very first book I ever read on writing that wasn't assigned to me in a classroom. And I return to it again and again, for inspiration, for comfort, for new ways to look at this crazy thing that we all do called writing. The title of the book explains how to tackle the seemingly impossible task of writing a book. It came from some advice that Ann Lamott's younger brother received from their father when he was doing a book report on birds and it seemed overwhelming. He told her little brother to "just take it bird by bird." Read it. Today!

There really is not any other bridal accessories you will certainly want. If you want to announce your marriage ceremony, you might send wedding announcement to inform good friends and family of the upcoming nuptials at a marriage ceremony destination of your alternative. This is a helpful means to advise folks concerning your marriage ceremony even if they can easily not be there.

The world is full of aphorisms.
For me, the most important qualities of "the best chocolate ice cream" are creaminess and a deep, intense chocolate flavor. Most recipes will suggest a whole lot of egg yolks to achieve creaminess, but in this case a combination of cornstarch and sweetened condensed milk does a better job. By using sweetened condensed milk, you not only introduce a slight caramel undertone, but also limit the amount of water in the mix. Cornstarch absorbs and holds water. Less ice crystals and a binding agent to hold them together translates into a more creamy consistency. Cocoa powder, vanilla extract and coffee add depth, and a pinch of salt brings out new dimensions of flavor in chocolate.

DSC played up that point in some regards. I think. I’m not sure what they're singing about and I don’t think it’s all that important in the grand scheme. The obvious Conan reference from their name speaks volumes to their Metal mythology or lack thereof. Again I think it's just that outsider status that makes them so unusual and somewhat scary like the Manson hippies. Living in the desert and appearing vaguely satanic was a potent mix since they don't appear to be clever enough to be faking it. Which seems to make them even more sinister and unpredictable.

Beyond these markers, we find none of the terms associated with racial mixture from the late 18th century onward, those terms so exactly delineated by the casta paintings. The rest of the population is treated as an un-delineated mass, with the only distinctions manifesting in honorifics. We do find Dons and Doñas during the colonial period. Of course, those status markers are dispensed with immediately in the Gran Colombian period, and replaced by the terms Ciudadano/a. Other status markers occasionally creep in– casique, gobernador de indios, gendarme, alcalde, and other offices. But, other “racial” terms that do appear in litigation never do here– there are no mestizos or zambos, no europeos or blancos, españoles, etc. Dons and Doñas appear in the padrones invariably as debtors, and only occasionally for moral crimes such as adultery or concubinato. The rest are the great undifferentiated plebe, the mob. But, from a “racial” perspective, were these masses NOT indigenous or african?

The church was smaller than I expected. There was no way soldiers survived more than 300 days with out support from the outside. Locals told me that their ancestors speak of how they helped the soldiers because of pity. We are a forgiving lot and it appears that Baler natives had forgiven the Spaniards even when they were still waging war. If it this was in any other nation, the Spaniards in Baler would have been dragged like animals in the streets and executed. But our Christian society, which the Spanish religious bequeathed us, even in war, does not tolerate such behavior.

"For as long as farm attacks are not viewed and classified as a separate type of crime, it will simply not be possible to crack down on the problem. It is true that this type of crime is difficult to classify precisely, but it cannot be denied that attacks of this nature differ from murders and attacks that occur in urban areas," Hermann said.
Yet more proof my job (& boss/friend) at the motorcycle shop kicks ass:
My first adult visit to the choir. Suggested by our lecturer, tickets in hand (around £13), a group of us attended. Courtesy of my friend’s early booking, we had front-row seats. Although there was some serious box seat envy expressed.
I went back and forth about whether or not to include someone from the Miss Bliss years. I’d like to think that season never existed, like most things in Indiana. On the other hand, if I’m including Leather Heather (Tori), I might as well mention Stevie. A former student of Miss Bliss, Stevie became a “huge” pop star that decided to have her final concert in a middle school lunch room in front of 20 people. Huge? More like GINORMOUS! Zack, being the young pimp he was, bets that he could kiss Stevie before the rest of his loser friends. He did, but he kissed the real-life Hannah Montana instead, who, by the way, was years older than Zack. How the hell did he do this his whole life? Well, until Franklin & Bash where he bangs 20 year olds. That’s for another day. Grade: B-

Quite a bit. I delved back into parapsychology and Cold War research, werewolf lore and legend and the primitive psychological fears humanity still harbors when faced with something different and wolfish. And science. Good heavens, there was some heavy science. Much of this shows up more distinctly in book two of the series, though, since I didn’t want to drown readers in detail—it doesn’t fit with the narrator’s personality.
Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it sometimes seems like this is what is going on. I'm sure you can think of some examples of what I'm talking about.

I found that this hard-as-nails business woman was revealed gradually, as the depth and layers of this ball-busting bitch are fleshed-out through the story. Against the background of an awkward and uncomfortable television setting, she is pitted against production staff with varying degrees of ethics, and struggles to hold her own during the twists that we’ve come to expect in reality shows.

The first time I tried one of their beers was at Edinburgh's Scottish Real Ale Festival in June. It was their Rye PA and, for me, it was one of the highlights of the festival. I've since been lucky enough to stumble upon a few of their beers when I've been through in Edinburgh. Lucky old Edinburgh drinkers for having the chance of tasting Tempest on a regular basis. It seemed that if I was wanting any more of their beer I would have to haul myself from west to east and it proved to be the case when I heard that one of the city's best pubs, The Bow Bar was planning a Tempest total tap takeover where ten of their beers would be available with eight on cask and a further two on keg.
So, let’s review the picks:
However, these colors were flat, and did not match my paper or chosen accent colors at all. So, my next step was to pull out the G12 I liked. I lightly brushed the G12 over the brown bear, starting in the shadows and feathering over the light areas. I did not blend. Here it may look kind of odd, but remember, this bear will be sitting on greenish paper.
No city in the world transforms in rain like Dublin. In the sunshine it is hard-edged and ugly and rank. In the rain it softens like a sponge, swelling, and all the open spaces narrow.
The first and most significant for traditional Christians who are sacramentally oriented, will be the Eucharist. In the Eucharist, Christ is supposed to transport the communicant to the event of calvary, along with the resurrection, and more broadly the creation of the world along with the eschaton. In the Eucharist, the communicant is re-presented with Christ himself, making both past events and future events really present realities. This poses a problem, however, if events in the future are in no sense real, which is what the A theorist is committed to. Although perhaps God could somehow re-present what was in the past as present, he could not present us with what is in the future, and is in no sense real. Imagine how the Eucharist at the Last supper looks if we admit that Christ had in no sense yet died for his Church.

Roast the corn (I like to have the ears pre-soaked in the husk in water for about one half-hour) on a gas grill. I haven’t timed the corn but I use a medium flame and turn the corn twice after allowing the husk to char. This is usually long enough for the water in the husks to steam into the corn kernels.

It was not to be. My stomach was still bothering me and I don't think I'd ingested enough nutrients over the preceding few days. Not to mention the fact that Jason and I went on a 9 mile bike ride on Friday. I didn't feel particularly sore or tired after that but, considering I haven't ridden a bike more than a few miles in almost 10 years, I'm sure it had an effect.

January came around and I began my training, especially for the swim. Every week for the past 4+ months I have spent many hours in the water. I started off barely able to swim 50 yards without passing out. After a few weeks I had to learn all over again because I was breathing on one side only, every second stroke. It felt like I was a beginner swimmer. Finally I was able to swim 100 yards, then 200 and 500 yards. The day came when I swam 3 500's with just a 30 second break in between. I was on cloud 9.

Each story ends with a note from Don Rosa about what Banks facts he drew from and how the writing process went. I was surprised to learn that Rosa is extremely devoted to making things historically accurate, right down to apologizing for every time he twists the historical record or the geographical one for the sake of the story. (In the last story, there’s a gag involving Scrooge owning the Eisner Award the series won, which Rosa worried about because the story was set in 1947, while the award was won in 1995.) Rosa is one of the world’s biggest Disney Duck fans, and it absolutely shows- everything is lovingly rendered and researched. He eschews mainstream comics (by which I mean Marvel and DC), wondering if the rest of the world thinks we all want to be grim vigilantes based on the state of our comic book industry. I was continually impressed with Rosa’s work, not only as a reader, but also as a fan–embarrassing though it may be, I treat The Legend of Zelda with the same love and respect, and I can certainly identify with that. (Lord knows it’s the only thing that makes sports films understandable to me.)

Nancy feels like what she does is more important than what police departments do in kidnapping cases. She wants her fans to know that she is the consummate investigator and she is there to tell them everything she can dig up about a case – even when doing so can hamper an investigation.
Historical Fiction has a different flavour depending upon the time period. Here in this title we take a trip back to the 10th Century as the reader embarks on a young monk’s quest to obtain St Oswald’s Bones for the consecration of a church as he proves that smarts and adaptation are the way to go over brawn. It’s a new type of tale and for me it was wonderfully executed with the lead character being not only personable but one that you want to succeed.

I had heard lots of positive things about the NZ dry hopped Long White Cloud since it's appearance at the Troon Beer Festival and those that tried it there informed me that it was one to look out for. For some, it was their beer of the festival. These reports of it's greatness turned out to be true. I adored the pungent fruit nose, the gloriously lush resinous hop kick and big, bold, crisp zing of the pineapple and passion fruit that's balanced beautifully with a robust malt spine. A solid and lovely drinking 5.6% gem. A wowser of a beer.

"But before we look at what is wrong and address it, we need to understand something. The core problem isn't the fact that we're lukewarm, halfhearted, or stagnant Christians. The crux of it all is why we are this way, and it is because we have an inaccurate view of God. We see Him as a benevolent Being who is satisfied when people manage to fit Him into their lives in some small way. We forget that God never had an identity crisis. He knows that He's great and deserves to be the center of our lives. Jesus came humbly as a servant, but He never begs us to give Him some small part of ourselves. He commands everything from His followers."

If true, I point out, he is overturning 2,000 years of Christian history. But he doesn’t even blink over his teacup. He’s either a very cool, calculating chancer, single-mindedly out to make a quick buck with an eye-catching theory that caters for gullible readers of the likes of The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail or Erich von Daniken’s Chariots of the Gods, or he’s absolutely sincere. “I am an art historian,” he responds calmly, “not a theologian, so I can approach the problem from a new angle.”
Step back a moment to look at the data. Granted, the Gippsland Dairy product will not be as sweet as as the Vaalia but it is very easy to adjust to! Gippsland dairy does do flavoured yoghurt but the fruit means more fruit sugar. I eat my natural yoghurt with REAL fresh fruit and cinnamon anyway. The fruit sugars in say, diced pear, are bound up in the fibrous walls of the fruit and therefore release slower during digestion.

The beginning scene was the most difficult to write because I had to try not to use words like, he or she, because I didn’t want the sex of Micha revealed until a pivotal point in the scene. I wanted Hyun-Gi to like Micha for her voice, and not because she was a female singer. The first time Hyun-Gi saw Micha she couldn’t really tell because Micha wore men clothing, had long chin-length hair that covered most of her face and had a deep voice.
But the dumplings. That was fun. My upstairs neighbors and I accidentally found ourselves hosting parallel dumpling parties, kept each other up the night before with rampant cabbage chopping, and got so busy that we never tasted each other's dumplings. His method was to prepare all fillings in advance and use his guests as a labor pool for assembly. Mine was a bit messier--I laid out bowls of filling components (including ground pork, shrimp, ginger, tofu, garlic, cabbage, carrot, daikon, mushrooms, scallions, garlic chives, tapioca starch) and bottles of condiments (amazingly, those bottles numbered well above 20, including sesame oil, soy sauce, fish sauce, chili, ponzu, ume plum vinegar, pepper vinegar, etc...), and made it a free-for-all.

Kam Dhillon? This young lad from Southall, London, may not have been known by many a few months ago, but after his scorching debut release called ‘Dance With Me (Aaja Ni Aaja)’, he is now a household name! The Bhangra industry today is very difficult to please, but the critics have found it extremely difficult to pass on any sort of negative comments about this album. Links have been made to the huge success of Bally Jagpal and his debut release of ‘Live & Direct’, which proved that any producer needs to introduce themselves with a truly explosive release, and Kam has not dissapointed one little bit!
1. Ease of cleaning: Wooden cutting boards need only be sealed using mineral oil once a month and washed with warm soapy water. Plastic cutting boards have a tendency to need sterilization and if you place them in the dishwasher, there is a good chance that it will warp. Wooden boards are just easier to wash and keep clean and the antimicrobial properties of wood will decrease the chances that your cutting surface will contaminate your food without you knowing it.

Hand loom weaving supports up to 9 times more families as all of the work is done by hand. In India, there are hundreds of villages that survive on the art of hand loom weaving alone and many of these villages are facing dire poverty as the demand for hand loom fabrics has dropped significantly in the shadow of the quicker, cheaper power loom option. We are trying to support these hand loom weaving villages and their dying art, as well as have a better effect on our environment.

These are really great for the price. For some reason they only sell them online, and they take a while to arrive (more than a week, which nowadays is a long time).

I think I’ll try one and put it somewhere where if I have to replace it it won’t be too much trouble.

The hectoring, bullying tone used against individual police officers throughout the inquiry, evident in the Macpherson Report, brings to mind the bullying and spiteful tone adopted by Stalin’s judge Andrei Vyshinsky during the show trials of senior Bolsheviks or that adopted by Roland Freisler, Hitler’s pet judge who presided over the trial of German officers involved in the July bomb plot. The Macpherson Report is a grossly disproportionate attack on the British Police. It must be seen as both a symptom and cause of institutional decay and the loss of confidence on the part of people who in normal times one would expect to be some of the first to lead the charge against the PC vandals. As I argued some seven years ago:
The Kids Are Alright is one of those small films that will undoubtedly get misconstrued for one of those "clever, smart, and sexy" (can't you just see that quote in the newspaper ads) satire on suburban family life; but don't let the poster art (which is like a bad mixture of Sunshine Cleaning and Sideways) fool you, here is a film with a lot of heart, a lot of humanity, and a lot of truth about how it tells its story. It made me smile from beginning to end; it made me feel happy and good; I'm sure there were things wrong with the film, but I just didn't care because all I wanted to do once the film was over was sit down with some friends have a delicious steak dinner. It's one of the best films of the year.

The plan does not preclude the city from joining forces with the county, which plans to build its own expanded forensics center at the Texas Medical Center. If the city and county were to cooperate through the local government corporation, Icken said, Commissioners Court would appoint two of the five board members and the city would appoint two. Commissioners Court and City Council would jointly appoint the chairman, just as they do for the Port of Houston Authority. Incredibly frustrating. Most pols at least offer lip service to the reality that working together would produce a better outcome, but lip service is all it is. The politicians involved appear unable to remove ego and an historic turf-war mentality from the process, and the predictable result is politicization, duplication, waste and higher costs for taxpayers. There are circumstances where rivalry and turf battles improve outcomes, but this is not one of them.

Furthermore, Kellogg’s never bothered to change any aspect of its marketing strategy or packaging for this vastly different customer. Instead, they arrogantly relied on their Western strategy to win the day. Employing their world famous strategy of “crispy flakes and premium quality” – unfortunately for them it turned soggy the moment it landed in hot milk, on every Indian breakfast table. Their price premium also made them an unaffordable luxury for the vast majority. Kellogg’s was so confident of replicating their global successes that they proceeded to immediately launch a whole series of brands, one after the other; in the end only compounding woes.

It goes without saying that the relationship is confined to the four corners of the bar. If it’s taken outside then it’s a different one all together and is not the subject of this present post. However, even a relationship with an MD outside the bar turns into a somewhat open relationship because the girlfriend/boyfriend of the MD will have to accept that it’s part of the MD’s job to be sweet to his guests. When the guest is a young female or otherwise falls into the category of the MD’s type, chances are the MD will go all out in being sweet and touchy-feely. A jealous boyfriend/girlfriend might not take that too well. Having and MD for a boyfriend or husband is not for the fainthearted.

If high-end talent is the lifeblood of any successful major college football program, that’s a disturbing trend if you’re a Georgia Tech fan. And while it’s hard to see a newbie Georgia State program playing in the Sun Belt being a credible threat, you do have to wonder how much damage it could do to Tech’s recruiting with lower profile talent if it had someone more dynamic than Bill Curry running the show.
By cunning intent, the time I set for this meeting coincided with Derek’s appointment. Next day, I stood outside my trailer door to welcome the guests as they arrived. Derek came first, so I told him to go inside and wait for me. Sally arrived a few minutes later and I went inside with her to join Derek. An extraordinarily awkward silence followed, as the two humans blushed and then avoided eye contact. Derek tried to get up and leave, but I blocked his exit.

This is a book everyone can appreciate, because it's about real life. We all have family drama (and Olga certainly has that!), and all our families have their quirks. We have all been in a tough spot at sometime or another, and we have all had to find our way out of that tough spot. That's what at the heart of this novel. One girl's path to becoming a woman, an event that changed her life, and the decisions she made after that. It's beautiful and it makes a good story. I am so glad Marie decided to write down her mother's tale.
And here is what the end of Day 14 looked like. Almost one of the two skeins of pencil roving spun up in a laceweight single. It appears this should make a fingering weight (or maybe even slightly thinner?) two-ply. I'm totally in love with this batch and can't wait to see how it's going to ply. Though, at this rate, it'll be next Tuesday before I'm done.
I didn’t get to take a look at the chemistry exam, because they told me that if I entered the room to look at the exam, I’d have to stay there for the entire two hours. Staring at the exam for two hours without a chance to solve most of the tasks (we got test-exams from our tutor, so I know I’m not even close to the required level for passing) would have greatly increased negative feelings about myself and caused me a lot of anxiety, so I opted out of that option. The problem isn’t that I couldn’t sit the exam: since the Christmas holidays I’ve been aware that I had fallen way behind my schedule – what annoyed me was that I had learned about the palaeontology test on Thursday, but registered for the chemistry exam on Tuesday. Had I known about the test only a few days earlier, I wouldn’t have signed up for the exam in the first place and thus saved that attempt. But, there’s no use crying over spilt milk…

This is such a touching and endearing film. I admit that I shed a tear during it. It is so sweet and heartwarming; I wish I could find more movies that pack the same emotional punch. I really cared for these characters and was strongly affected by the film. What makes this movie so great are the incredible performance by the entire cast and the fantastic writing. If you want a movie that will make you feel something than I strongly recommend this.

There she becomes involved with many of the other residents, being ‘befriended’ by Leah and Sondra, as well as helping Doctor Carmichael in the infirmary. She discovers Ruth has also been kidnapped. The witch is particularly interested in another prisoner, Savannah Levine. However, ‘poltergeist activity’, that many of those in the compound associate with Savannah, plays a role in the death of Ruth.

Jack had promised to make a start on trimming the ivy before he went out, but she could see no sign of his efforts. True, the wheelbarrow was parked halfway up the garden, where the ivy grew thickest, but the fence post was still leaning precariously, covered by leaves. She wasn’t sure whether the ivy’s tendrils were pulling it down, or holding it back from falling; she’d warned Jack to be careful when he cleared it, sure that the wood underneath would be splintered and cracked.

It must've been wheelchair day. We saw a mom wheeling her delayed teenager through the toy aisles. I smiled at her, and we continued passing them all throughout the store. Was her daughter on target? Not a bit, but she was happy and enjoying spending time with her "mama". Then I saw a gorgeous teenager, not delayed, but also in a chair. Wheeling herself through the card aisle, giggling with her girlfriends. I'm sure her mom's heart broke when she realized her daughter would be in a wheelchair, but her daughter was well-adjusted, happy, even carefree.
I placed the lids of plastic shoe boxes upside down under the wire to hold water with a large surface area to generate more humidity. I put a “bumper” of paper towels around the wire because sometimes little legs can get stuck between the grate and the wall. I covered all of this with foam shelf liner; I usually use paper towels but wanted to give this a try. So far, I like the way it will further protect the chicks from the edges. I have a piece of aquarium tubing running through an vent hole down into a shoe box lid so that I can add more water without opening the incubator. Last hatch, the chicks climbed on the tubing and it fell inside, so now I am using a vent hole plug on the tubing to keep that from happening again. I like to put the eggs in a cut-down carton to keep them air-cell-up and prevent hatched buddies from knocking them around. I cut off the tops and the bottoms so that air can move all around the egg preventing the chick from stifling if they pip in an odd place.

I started by tracing one of the blank dividers onto the cardboard to make a template. The edges are raised, so I wanted the scrapbook paper to fit down into the insert. By making my cardboard piece to fit, all I had to do was trace it 16 times to make the set. This took some trimming of the cardboard to get a perfect fit...and I may or may not have wanted to chuck the whole thing out the window and just cough up the $10...but I'm too proud and far too cheap for that, so on I pressed.

This is the classic adaptation of the Chandler novel even though the Michael Winner remake from 1978 is more literally faithful. produced on a bog budget, the second classic pairing of husband-and-wife team Bogart and Bacall works like a charm even if the original story and characters have been largely filleted and generally mucked around with.

It seems there’s a perception that women must always be dilettantes, that their involvement trivialises what should be a very serious masculine rite. I felt this first when researching for my novels set in 17th century France, and approached a local fencing club for help checking the choreography of my sword-fights. The very helpful Secretary duly forwarded my query to one of their experts, but I don’t think I was meant to see the reply. The man responded to the Secretary without seeing I was copied in, and all he said was ‘Tell her to watch “The Mark of Zorro”’.

Emma lived from 985 to 1052 and was the sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. When AEthelred the Unready was King of England from 978–1013 and again from 1014–1016, he was under attack by the Vikings on all coasts, all the time and his first wife had died. He was badly in need of cash, resources and men to fend off these attacks. In looking for alliances, he turned to Normandy. Emma could bring a dowry and the necessary resources needed to fight the Vikings, so AEthelred offered her marriage.

It is my nature, when blowing my nose, to do so louder than what might be considered normal, sane, or safe for anyone within a 3 foot radius. A couple of years ago, whenever I blew my nose, it was Tevye’s custom to say, at an equal volume to my nose-blowing, “Go Leafs Go”. For the longest time I could not figure out why he was doing this, and at the time his language hadn’t developed to a point were he was able to enlighten me. Each and every time, though, that’s what he would do. Then one night we were watching hockey, and the Leafs scored(a rarity, I know). As soon as the goal horn sounded, Tevye exclaimed “Go Leafs Go”, and it was then that I knew he associated the sound of my mucus-extraction with the goal horn in Toronto.
5. One of these horrible mid-to-fast party rock n' roll Manowar songs. I might figure out which but there's absolutely nothing here for me. I can list the Manowar songs I adore from memory (Battle Hymns, Mountains, Secret of Steel, March for Revenge, Hail to England, Gayanna, Gloves of Metal, Each Dawn I Die) and if it ain't in there, I am bound to hate it, not just feel indifferent to it. Something about "the Night" is what Adam's going on about on this song, it could be about motorcycles. It's post Kings of Metal, I can tell from the involved guitar solo. But it sucks. "Return of the Warlord", off of Hell on Wheels live, from 1997. I am deleting this. Good drumming at least.

Set almost entirely in London, England during five frantic weeks before Christmas follows a web-like pattern of inter-related, loosely related and unrelated stories of a dozen or more various individuals with their love lives, or lack of them. The central character is the new bachelor prime minister David who cannot express his growing feelings for his new personal assistant Natalie. The prime minister’s older sister Karen slowly grows aware of her husband Harry’s flirtation with an office worker named Mia. Karen’s friend Daniel is a recently widowed writer whose 11-year-old son asks for love advice about a girl he has a crush on. Meanwhile, Jamie is another writer who leaves his girlfriend after catching her cheating on him and travels to France to write a novel where he pursues a possible romance with his non-English speaking Portuguese maid Aurelia. Also, Harry’s American secretary Sarah questions a romance she pursues with the office hunk Karl, but her personal family problems get in the way. Other secondary characters involve a photographer who pursues his best friend’s new wife Juliet; a pair of movie stand-ins, named John and Judy, who grow closer after their simulated love scenes; a libidinous chum who wants to travel to Wisconsin, USA to score with women; and a burned-out former rock star named Billy Mack who is the main connection between all stories involved.Set almost entirely in London, England during five frantic weeks before Christmas follows a web-like pattern of inter-related, loosely related and unrelated stories of a dozen or more various individuals with their love lives, or lack of them.

Americans hate war, and are always sure that as soon as the most recent war is ended that there will be no more trouble in the world.

And when the next war comes along, because we are perceived as weak, we are never, never ready.

It just gets weirder and weirder. These stories tell of a downward spiral among Israel caused by people who did as they saw fit. If you don’t respect a centralized ethical system, then you end up making your own gods, being dissatisfied with the inheritance given you by God, you rape and murder and then go to war with your brothers. That’s what happens when men direct their own ethical steps. That’s what happens when human beings fail to recognize the King of heaven as the master of morality.

To Enter:
Given the social position of the few people who occupied such jobs in Marx's day, it is no wonder that he would define such people as forming a Middle Class. But, today, we would not define many such people that way. That is precisely the point about the Marxist method – it does not lead us to see categories as fixed for all time, but as being fluid, and only definable in relation to each specific case. But, if we take Engels statement to Bloch as our basis, we may also not want to commit the other mistake that many Marxists have fallen into of having a purely Economic Determinist analysis that also fits with a need to define the working class as broadly as possible out of a misplaced desire to verify the prediction of the Manifesto, and also out of a tendency on the Left to disdain the idea that Marxists should also set out to win the Middle Class. If we define as Working-Class everyone who does not own their means of production, or who is unable to live to a reasonable standard solely from their Capital, then everyone other than a few thousand families in Britain would be working class. There are many people for whom that is true, and who occupy those kinds of function described by Marx above, but whose standard of living, the nature of their work, etc. more closely resembles that of the ordinary worker. But, there are also many who, whilst not owning their means of production, and so on, have a standard of living that is substantially better than that of the ordinary worker, whose other life experiences – for example their education, the social relations they have, the aspirations they have, and the nature of their work – separates them from the mass of ordinary workers. They are not Capitalists, but nor are they simple proletarians. If we do not adequately theorise this then it is impossible to develop strategies that are capable of winning over such strata. In the main, the post-war Left has not felt that such a strategy is necessary. On the contrary, the middle class has largely been written off. In fact, the more the Left has abandoned the idea of a strategy based on regaining ownership of the means of production, and instead simply adopted the redistributionist and Economistic solutions of the Fabians the more it has seen the Middle Class as merely a source of Tax Revenue, in order to carry through such a policy. Its no wonder then that this large section of society has been driven towards the Tories, and is only driven away from them when the Tories themselves fail to deliver the goods.

Peeps were trying to revive the obviously dead corpse, and while walking at the pace of a land turtle back to my own scooter, I realized something. This is the second time today, that I have received a message from outside myself. I stopped in a Starbucks at Exit #123 (Is it the real number?) to write this while it is fresh.
I took my cardstock and scored it 4 times width-wise at 2, 4, 8 and 10 inches apart. Then I turned the cardstock so it was vertical and at 2-1/2 inches, I cut from one score line to the other one. I did this on both sides.

If you're looking for some high action reading with character based plot and motivations, The Harlequin will provide much fodder for the imagination of both player and Game Master.
Robbed of her red skirt (plus, the tan, super-sheer pantyhose that lay chicly beneath its funneled exterior), her matching bred lazer, and a white blouse, Glenda loses some of her appeal as the two men, one wearing a blue t-shirt and one wearing a red t-shirt, begin to paw at her organic structure. It's gets worse when her wig falls off and her fake-looking breasts failed to jiggle after being repeatedly poked and prodded by the unruly men. Luckily, the scene is saved somewhat when a naked Glenda wanders back to the mansion to describe, in graphic detail, her encounter with the two burly men to her piano-playing husband. Asking her point blank as he tickled the ivories: "Did you suck their cocks?" To which she quickly responds, "Why certainly." "What kind of cocks were there?" he sheepishly inquires. Uh, "they were normal cocks." I know, Glenda, what's this guy's problem? Anyway, the sex scene itself features the missionary position, some reverse cowgirl action (with an off to side handy), and a brief session of anal spooning.
Ethiopia’s position was strengthened at the time by the strong connection to US foreign policy interests. With Egypt moving towards the Soviet sphere of influence, the United States took advantage of Ethiopia’s reaction to the NWA by proposing a study of the development of the upstream Nile waters in Ethiopia. By 1964 the US Bureau of Reclamation had produced the Blue Nile Waters Study, which included proposals for a series of huge dams and irrigation schemes in Ethiopia. These projects never came to fruition, yet helped to stoke Egyptian fears surrounding the actions of upstream riparians.

As I watch my son sleeping now, nine years later, I am amazed at this child who came so dramatically into the world. My 7lb 3oz baby who litterally got stuck, has not been stuck ever again. A child who gave his older brother the courage to face fears. A little boy who had excema on his face and a ready smile to all he met. A baby who did not toddle, but ran. A child who still bursts forth head first into things in life. A sensitive guy who many people misinterpret. A little boy who is more like me than I sometimes want to acknowledge. I sit here, nine years later, and thank God for the lessons Cullen has taught me. From learning to love another child, to watching brothers grow with one arm slung around the other's shoulders. From early morning feedings where it is just baby and Mommy, to double stroller walks with Daddy. Somewhere along the way he potty trained in one day, learned to read, tie his shoes, and will be entering the 4th grade. His peaceful sleeping face reflects not only the child he was, but the man he will become, with God's grace.

Their live shows were largely theatrical (check next picture), with Gabriel changing customs (check the last picture – a slipperman) a lot and with a lot of scenario-related props. However, they differed from their contemporaneous bands in that they still focused on presenting very well structured music, rather than only on the show, as Circus’ Ron Ross said:

As I’ve learned more about this project, I couldn’t wait to share it with you! I encourage you to consider treating yourself through this retreat…take a group from your church or neighborhood. Or…make plans with some far-flung friends to meet in Minneapolis and enjoy this time together. I am certain you will be enriched! Many of you are mothers who are raising children with disabilities…I can assure you that you will be with women who understand the intricacies of this experience as you enjoy a bit of a breather.
You, the writer, should know all of the answers to these questions, even if these answers do not make their way onto your pages. Why? Because the answer to these questions will reveal your character’s fully rounded personality, and it is this personality, the accumulation of all facets of the individual’s life and experiences, that will determine other aspects of your novel, such as how your protagonist responds to particular events before him.
Here's a list of dos and don'ts to help you along.

In Iraq, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has touted his success in thwarting Washington's belated (and halfhearted) efforts to keep a significant number of U.S. forces in his country after the end of this year. His coalition partner and fellow Iranian cat's paw, Muqtada al-Sadr, already is boasting that he also will drive out the American contractor personnel who are, for the moment, expected to provide a measure of security after the military withdraws. In that case, we may well see the mullahs' agents take over a U.S. embassy for the second time since 1979 - this one the newest, largest and most expensive in the world.

One episode of just recaps doesn’t bother me too much. Sometimes if a series is particularly long and a recap episode is placed somewhere in the middle to give us a break from the main story, I actually enjoy seeing the first half of the series being narrated by one of the characters in a nutshell. At times it highlights the best moments from previous episodes, and it’s nice to go back and relive those moments without actually going back to an episode to watch the whole thing again. Sailor Moon has some recap episodes like these, and I watched them for my own benefit. With a series mainly on DVD these days, it’s easier to skip filler episodes to get back into the main story. I still like the option to watch the recap episode if I felt like it. Usually the way they present a recap episode is through a main character reminiscing on the events that have passed with another character in the series. It’s the best way to include a recap episode into a series without it feeling like it shouldn’t be there in the first place.
Over a period of three weeks, with several women writing and others offering suggestions, we produced an Open Letter to Roth, which serves as a critique of his essay, signed by 17 global women’s human rights groups. Our letter is accompanied by a petition.

So, I left the Lake, Geoff and Carole, the UP, Joe, the forest with mixed feelings. I felt that I have reached a turn in my perception of life, as ambiguous and clear as I could manage to sort it out in a several hours of drive. It seemed so easy to find the joy and happiness up there, surrounded by the wilderness and generosity of nature. Will I be able to find the same range of emotions and the ability to change perceptions on my journey toward self and recovery of my health in this city of eight million people? With fear and anticipation I approached Chicago, hoping that my new-found sense of self would not disappear, absorbed in the hectic pace of noise and humanity.
I’m still trying to make sense of last night. I mean, WHOA! So many people, too many beers, too loud of music, and too many guys making googly eyes in my direction, Now, I like male attention as much as the next girl, but last night was all about hanging out with my friend and coworker whom I’ve never hung out with outside of work before. Those seem to be the nights guys can’t keep their paws to themselves.

From there I moved on to an acrylic painting of a pear, watercolors of pears, and so forth. Sometimes I added apples, but my heart belongs to the pear. My next project is going to be pastel pears. When I adopted pastels into my repertoire two years ago, I stuck with other subjects, trying to branch out. Now my pear collection seems a bit narrow in media scope!

I hope Spring is with you all, it certainly has been in Scotland for the past week, we had our first BBQ at the weekend, hopefully the first of many, weather allowing!!
I suggested blow up plastic pool lounges. Hey, they have cup holders! Hubby thought we could put rugs down and use the store credit to buy every pillow they have, and have a more exotic living room. Then I suggested lawn furniture, especially the hard plastic, stackable kind. Hubby said if we needed durability, he could always build a sofa out of bricks, and then put cushions on it. I thought that would scratch the floor. So he then suggested Lego bricks. And said this way we could rearrange the furniture and change it any time. And it would double as a play room for Kerri. Pookie hid his head under my pillow. And I was amazed we did not wake up Kerri with our out-of-control fits of crazy laughter. We came up with many more funny ideas. But in the end, we resigned ourselves that we will be spending a very long weekend shopping for couches.

Your atheist friends are right that there is an important logical difference between believing that there is no God and not believing that there is a God. Compare my saying, “I believe that there is no gold on Mars” with my saying “I do not believe that there is gold on Mars.” If I have no opinion on the matter, then I do not believe that there is gold on Mars, and I do not believe that there is no gold on Mars. There’s a difference between saying, “I do not believe (p)” and “I believe (not-p).” Logically where you place the negation makes a world of difference.

The biggest news is that my Mom had surgery last Thursday the 15th. For this event, I was super scared. Surgeries scare me. My step-grandpa died on the surgery table and my grandma (different side) had a stroke while in surgery which didn't kill her but lead to her death. Surgeries just don't give me any positive feelings and scare me like crazy. Therefore, the days leading up to the surgery and surgery day, I was stressed and could cry at the drop of a hat. With much relief I can say that all went fine and while she feels like she got ran over by a semi, she is OK.

Finally, as if anyone in Leeds needs reminding - CAMRA's Leeds Beer Festival is taking place now. If its tips you're after, I can wholeheartedly recommend Hopstar's Smokey Joe Black Beer and Thornbridge's Chiron. Leeds's Gyle 479 was sitting in wooden glory amongst the rows of plastic and steel, and the beer was excellent; with a much more pungent, rum/whisky-esque nose than the plummy delights of the bottled version. I understand this has now run out, but I think there are still some bottles kicking around.

Here in Perth over the last week or so, it’s really begun to feel like autumn. Crisp mornings, sunny days, the odd shower and cooler evenings have all been welcomed in this household. I love that it’s cool enough to put on slippers and cosier pyjamas, but warm enough during the day to spend time outdoors in the sunshine.

Well, October is almost over and I have been so busy, I almost let the month go by without a post. ALMOST. I have to warn you, I am in a very silly mood tonight. Almost slapstick...probably because it is almost midnight and I have been awake for a very long time.
I will admit, I dyed up the Fat Cat just for this project, but as it's Wandering Cat Yarn, it doesn't count as stash enhancement! I did use leftover Tabby Cat for the underside, and more of the Fat Cat will get used up on another Octopus requested by another friend. Octavius Bob brings my used yardage up by another 100 yards.

When I saw that I thought to myself "yeah I want to do that one day". Well I feel like I've been living that ad over and over again this year. Except for those three weeks in January where we had summer like temperatures we have had a lot of rain, rain and more rain. We may finally catch a break this coming Sunday.

All of this deconstruction component by component focuses on the advertiser and the advertisement. We then have the additional principle of the whole thing.

Suomenlinna subsequently housed units of the Finnish army and the submarine fleet and served in Finland's air defence during World War II.

A couple of weeks ago three of my peers and I went down to Joplin, Mo. for a day. We left with a list of about five churches we were hoping to visit when we got there and a lot of anxiety about what we were going to see when we got there. Our goal was to report on thanks and faith in Joplin, and try to get at what the first Thanksgiving was going to be like after an extreme natural disaster.
Of course the question "Why do you like horror films?" is an unfair. You might as well say why do you like the color blue? Because it appeals to me. Why does it appeal to you? Who knows? I don’t think any of us really know where our tastes come from. Why certain things strike cords within us. Of course no one asks such things about our nice socially expectable tastes. Nobody turns to me in the middle of a conversation and asks me with an air of J’Accuse and demands to know why I prefer Chopin to Mahler. Or why I like the poems of Czelaw Milosz. Nobody says “How dare you edify your perverted sensibilities with David Mitchell and Dennis Lehane!” I don’t catch people glaring at me when I wear a Ramones shirt the same way I sometimes do when I go out in one of my horror shirts.

Later She begs forgives and helps him outside since she cannot find the wrench. He asks if She will kill him. She says "not yet. When the Three Beggars arrive, someone must die." The Three Beggars being a Crow, a Deer and a Fox. The film climaxes when it is suggested She could have saved their son but was more concerned with her own sexual pleasure. Then in the film's most talked about scene she severs her clitoris while masturbating. He finds the wrench after freeing the crow. She stabs him with a pair of scissors and He strangles her. He burns She's body in a funeral pyre outside of the cabin. He then leaves the cabin, walking through the forest as the Three Beggars watch. He then sees hundreds of women walking towards him, their faces blurred.

On the other hand, if someone has no community, then what should be a relatively minor setback can cause them to lose their home.

So I thought, well Monet did it and it looks pretty mavelous; I think I will give it a whirl too. So here you go -Monet's Blues, I think it turned out pretty good.

ChristieO wants us to write a letter to ourself about the things that happen in 2012 from the point of view of it being 2013. Confused? Yeah, me too! But what a great exercise in goal setting!

Being a realistic novel, the story is of now, the space is where we live and it proves to be a good past time occupying activity. Its easy on language and has a lucid vocabulary, so that one doesn’t needs to carry a dictionary along. Funny at times, it grasps the attention and turns interesting in several parts. The action seems to be condensed in the first 40 pages – love, dating, live-in, sex, college life, struggle for jobs, after which the story seems to lose the pace and give the readers a space to turn a few pages at times. Being the story of how and why the families fall in love the readers are compelled to stick-in upto the end.

I have been in Greenwich most of this week and, at 0100 in the early hours of Thursday morning, I went down to find the front passenger window of my car had been smashed in. The double locking system on my Toyota means that, if you do smash through the window, you still can’t open the door from the inside. So the yobbo only rummaged through my glove compartment and only managed to steal… the Toyota manual for my car.
Now I don’t recommend people react at quite that level, but what I would love is just for one day in America, it would be great if everyone who saw someone being inconsiderate would just say something. Not get into get in an argument or whip a bucket of popcorn at them but just say excuse me, you’re being inconsiderate please don’t do that. I think in the end this really does have an effect on people, they might react negatively but later it bothers them to have been an inconsiderate ass.

Next, we hung up the black metal piece that I spoke of earlier. For some reason, I can't get enough of the scroll work on it- it's probably my favourite home accent.
Life as an artist isn’t often wonderful. In fact, the wonder is often overshadowed by the rejection, disappointment, judgment and resentment. The incredible amount of blood, sweat and tears that we pour into our art often goes unnoticed and if it is noticed, so often it is regarded as unimportant.

Is there a difference, you ask? I think there is. Rudeness is often unintentional because it is defined by an individual. Meanness is always intentional.

I thought it might be fun to look at some of the “firsts” in mystery writing. The books, or stories mentioned here are old and you may have to ask for them through inter-library loan! I am not an “expert” here, so if I have made an error in my assumptions I apologize. But this is what I have found so far.

Now, less than 50 people might not seem like a lot. But it apparently was good enough that it got the attention of the people who run Stageit.com, who asked Lester’s people if they could put on another show … very soon … this time on Stageit’s “main stage,” which means a higher profile. The next show — set for 45 minutes without an encore — is scheduled to take place on Stageit.com on March 24 at 6 p.m. Pacific Time. Watch for a link to Lester’s next show coming very soon.
Even when someone has said something not-so-great about my personality I don't immediately dismiss such a comment, especially from someone I respect. Even if I find it to be untrue I still consider their position.
President Obama’s claim that he had Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden exterminated deflated the threat from that long-serving bogyman. A terror organization that left its leader, unarmed and undefended, a sitting duck for assassination no longer seemed formidable. Time for a new, more threatening, bogyman, the pursuit of which will keep the “war on terror” going.

1. Babywearing - I did register for a baby bjorn but there are so many other slings and carriers I wish I had known about. It also would have been nice to really know about the benefits to babywearing. I just got it for convenience more then anything. If I had known about all the wonders of wearing your child - I would have done it more often in the early months. Thankfully Lauren at Hobomama has written extensively on the subject of babywearing.

33. I am in love with those little orange-y fruits called CUTIES.
Stanza four. The hero is born, Jesus, the infant born to die. He breaks into this world, retaining and yet veiling His divinity. He is God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father by whom all things were made. And yet here he lays, bloodied and filthy in the mess of human childbirth, fully man, born to take upon himself that which only our hero God can accomplish. This baby, at present in the warm nestles of the virgin’s tired arms, will henceforth die in 33 years. He will live perfectly, being undeserving of His fate and yet will willingly assume the deserving role to rescue that which He created from the bondage of the filth and messiness of sin. This hero’s moving course began with His first, tiny, inhale and exhaled infant cry.

I met Erica over a year ago when she was opening her quaint shop, and since then every time I walk by on my way to the studio her floral displays outside make my day brighter and happier.

“Farther Away” begins with Franzen going to an isolated island to do some bird watching and be alone in nature. He takes along Robinson Crusoe is sets off in search of a rare bird species, planning to eschew most modern conveniences, read the book, and write about the solitary experiences. He also plans to spread some of Wallace’s ashes on the island, imagining his friend would love his ashes being spread on a beautiful island that’s hard to get to. As Franzen fights a losing battle with nature, he begins to process some of of the grief and anger that he’s held at bay in the years since his friend’s death. I was stunned by the power of his words and by his brutal insights into Wallace’s suicide. SPOILER ALERT:
Some girls start in life with the idea that to snub the opposite sex is the surest way of bringing it to their feet. All such imaginings are vain! A man may be amused by the coquettish impertinences of a girl, he may even be attracted by it to a certain extent, but in the end he feels repulsion, and unless it be the exception that proves the rule, hastens away presently to lay his name and fortune at the disposal of some more modest girl.

By 1949 the anti-comics hysteria wanes a bit and publishers begin to leave the ACMP. Timely may have left early on but at some point must have returned as their covers sported a small ACMP stamp from April 1952 to January 1955 on most titles.
“By ourselves and the Sibiu, both,” Lord Thibault said with excitement coloring his cheeks. “Imagine what we could accomplish if it could be shown that we have the power to aim the stuff of nightmares into the hearts of our enemies’ strongholds?”
Analyzing liberal and left hypocrisy, YIISA Associate Professor Neil Kressel, already showed in 1992 that progressives aim at antisemites as long as they are right-wing or Nazis. Antisemitism from the Third World or from minority groups, including the left, have never been a topic for mainstream scholars and journalists in the US. Contrary to fantasies about a powerful ‘Israel-Lobby’ in the US, antisemitism is very strong among the elites in America. The recent Yale decision is proof for this.

In due course there were several copy-cat shows which toured all over America, and many with women managers, although by the twentieth century Burlesque evolved into something else - the shows increasingly risqué, having less to do with the wit of the songs and more about titillating striptease - whereas for Lydia Thompson and her troupe of British girls, the stage costumes were archly suggestive rather than blatantly bawdy.
So my question to you is where do you think I made the mistakes here? Where was the lesson? Well, when I was freshly going through the heartbreak, through my tears, there was a resounding I LEARNED NOTHING FROM ALL OF THIS OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT MEN, LOVE AND DATING SUCKS! If this is what it’s all about, I want no part of romantic love! I was nothing but beautiful and loving to this man, I showed my true self to him and all he did was throw it away, and left me abandoned, and I don’t even know why!!

The way to solve this problem, implemented in GDDR5, is to add a DBI bit. The right side of the figure shown above illustrates the same state transitions, but with the addition of a DBI bit. When asserted, the DBI bit indicates that the data bus should be inverted. The inversion state can change from transfer to transfer and it is changed to minimize the number of data-bit state changes and thus minimize the I/O switching current and the number of aggressor bits from one transfer to the next. Again, this is how it’s done for GDDR5 memory. The DBI method used for DDR4 SDRAM is not yet public.
