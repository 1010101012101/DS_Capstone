So now I will tell the world how to make fresh, delicious homemade biscuits from scratch in no time.
We had asked our hotel, the Blue Diamond, to send a car to pick us up, but when we exited the baggage claim area, no one was there with a sign for us. We found the hotel number and called them, but they just suggested that we get a cab. We had read that the taxis here were difficult to deal with, but we walked up to the taxi warden and told him where we needed to go. He signaled a taxi for us and off we drove—at the slowest pace imaginable. Usually these taxis are flying by, and here we are in the slowest one I have ever seen. Later we discussed that we had read something about the traffic being so congested that they now meter on time instead of distance, which might have been why he was driving so slowly.

A dark red fox checking me out.
Here’s where I started LOVING delicata even though I hadn’t tasted it yet: the skin is super thin, so you don’t have to peel it! At all! Peeling squashes can be a pain, so skipping this step made me a happy camper. I then cut each half into slices, and they all went into the crockpot:
Drop teaspoonfuls of dough into confectioners' sugar and shape into balls. Place on a baking sheet and bake approximately 10 minutes.
But before the new season arrives, a fire destroys the baths. Ravenhall Baths is gone and transformed into a memory for generations of Brooklynites. In 1957 it was the Dodgers, and now in 1964, it is Ravenhall. Brooklyn is changing and Tommy and Joseph learn a lesson regarding the lack of permanence.
Where does the music come from?
They also have buko pie but that was sold out when I dropped by. All pies are P98 and are not discounted like other Dough Joe selections. Not bad for a decent-tasting medium-sized pie! This is another reason to keep going back to Dough Joe.
Also very '20's, Tory Burch's hammered-silk Darya dress, the one I would pick for a spring wedding or simply to feel pretty, worn with long strands of pearls. ($450 from net-a-porter.)
Despite widespread support from both the public and MPs for a complete ban on the use of wild animals in circuses, the government is continuing to pursue an expensive and ill-conceived inspection and licensing regime. Such a system would not prevent animals in circuses from suffering.

Bringing in a huge urn with grasses broke up the space to create interest and definition. Notice the careful placement and repetition of select color. Tiny vases of yellow flowers make a statement without getting in the way of food serving.
Oh! I also started back on my Lamictal at a low dose in an effort to combat post-holiday depression. Sure, I might not get it…but after my last 3 major overseas holidays I’ve had a massive post-holiday crash. I can’t afford 2 weeks in bed with my head stuffed under my pillow hoping to non-existent deity that I don’t wake up in the morning…if I ever get to sleep, that is!
Of course I was fourteen so long ago to write about that period - something I think of doing more and more - amounts to historical fiction. I recognise much of myself in my son, but our lives could not have been more different.
And perhaps that is the reason for their magic and attraction: their transcience. Like camellias or cherry blossoms, blink (or go away on holiday) and you miss them!

So I am dedicating this post, to my that-special-person, my cousin, S. I am 12 years elder than her, but I am her favorite "Akka" and she is my sweetie-pie. Right from her childhood (and mine too! You know, I am not that old!) we have a mutual affection for each other, which keeps growing each day. I was (and am) so pleasantly happy to love and be loved by a cousin, as I don't have siblings and I used to be one nasty, mean, b****y cousin to the rest of them ;)
Okay, I’m going to pause our regularly scheduled blogging for a random post. I’d like to talk a little bit about how to cancel a wedding. I know, strange, but go with me here. When I cancelled my wedding, I Googled for advice on how to do so several times. I wanted information and guidance, but a large part of me wanted to find someone out there going through what I was going through. If nothing else, I want my blog to serve as a resource for people who have gone through rough break ups. So I hope that anyone out there needing advice on how to cancel their wedding will have a chance to find my blog through this post (and the wonders of Google).
However, much to the delight of Israel’s growing Zionist movement, the hidden political hegemony of America was predictably on hand to halt any progress. Obama delicately informed UN delegates on Thursday that the same country which so often prides itself on how it values ideas of democracy and freedom would veto Palestine’s bid if it managed to reach the Security Council. In his most pro-Israeli speech yet, Obama told the world that the only road to peace was through diplomatic talks between the two countries; mirroring Bush’s somewhat nonchalant approach some years earlier.

This granola makes my taste buds so happy. Its crunchy. Its nutty. Its crunchy some more. Slightly sweet from honey and sugar it also has a bit of a salty bite every once in a while. The cocoa powder adds a hint of chocolate flavor but nothing over powering. The coconut oil lends itself beautifully against the nutty oats and toasted hazelnuts. And millet seeds. Oh millet seeds. I adore them. I really have no words. They just make this granola a 1000 times better. Trust me.

Looking at this one here, though, I start getting an idea to allow the things within them to not be random, but to tell a story. These little animals put me in mind of fairy tales and getting lost in the woods. I feel like there should be a red riding hood in here. But that wouldn't fit with the color tale, would it?

What we are seeing unfolding in the publishing world at the moment is deep-rooted in a failure by large publishing houses to take hold of their industry and direct its development more than twenty years ago when the largest fish in the publishing sea decided to eat up as many little fish as they could. The landscape of publishing that emerged when the tummies got fat was one wholly controlled by retailers - big mother-fucker retailers who had retailing and profit as their core objective - certainly, not books or literature. It stood to reason, and the view of man and woman in the street, that massive corporations like Google, Amazon and Apple where going to come out on top because they were the ones to hold the first cut-keys to the castle of digital content. They had the vested and commercial interest as well as the vision and means to realize the importance of controlling and managing digital content for profit.

So, I have some crazy news: We're taking a (very) spontaneous quick trip to Amsterdam! Leaving tomorrow!! Here's the story: We were planning to take Toby to Europe this summer, but we priced out the flights, and it was prohibitively expensive. (Summer flights to most major European cities started at $1400; and we'd need to buy three.) We figured our Europe dreams were dashed, until we realized that if we squeezed a trip in April, the flights were much less expensive—and the overall trip would be doable if we stayed for just a handful of days.
While we were continuing to assess the situation and awaiting the ambulance,and in a split second the female said something to the male in Spanish, he replied also in Spanish. They were told by an officer not to continue speaking to eachother.

Allow the minced garlic to stand in the vinegar for 10-15 min before preparing recipe. This will help take the “bite” from the garlic and mellow it. *Just so you know, this dressing has a HUGE BITE no matter what you do, but it is awesome.* Add the ingredients together and blend blend blend! Add to salad to taste. Make sure you are cautious with the amount you use. It is super duper strong!

Then on Thursday we left Massachusetts, drove through Rhode Island and finally moved into Connecticut. The sunshine appeared and we headed for Mystic - because I had seen photos of it before (and it looked lovely) and we fancied some pizza. After this we drove along the coast and then up to Danbury, CT to meet fellow blogger Jeanne Iris for a delightful dinner and a tour of her town. Altogether the New England experience was fantastic (photos of the last section below). We'll be back with New Jersey and eventually NYC photos soon.

So, when Revlon come out with a new lip line, Lip Butters, I was intrigued to say the least. The thought of a lip butter makes me the think of an extremely creamy lip product. The Revlon Lip Butters are more than a balm but not quite a lipstick. You get the nourishing hydrating feel of a lip balm, and for the most part you get the color of a lipstick. The one thing you don't get with these butters is long wear.
I don't mind very much, but I'm afraid I won't really recognise it when I return for a visit. That the place I used to call home will feel only vaguely familiar -- like it's a place I've only dreamt about, but never been. A place where coriander is called cilantro, where butter is measured in tablespoons instead of grams, and where I don't use the word "quite" quite so often. I'm afraid I'll get caught pronouncing the "h" in "herb" and people will look at me strangely.

But then nearly two weeks ago I woke up and saw an email on my phone from Spain. It said I had been placed in Andalucia. I felt shocked, but not very excited. It didn’t say where I would be or what age students I’d be teaching (I’m not great with kids so this was especially important). No, to find that out I would have to blindly accept the position. But I came to my senses and realized I would have to be crazy to not live anywhere in the South of Spain.

That was 2+ years ago. I could go into great detail about the past 2 years but I won’t. I’m not going to lie and tell you that I’m “cured” and these thoughts don’t still bother me. They very much so do. There have been close calls and stupid things that relied on. The point is, I was shown hope. I was given that friend that truly and honestly has never left me by the way side. Do I deserve everything he’s done for me? Nope, not at all. In fact there have been times where I’ve told him not to bother with me anymore, there is no hope. In my case, it was very true that all I really needed was a good friend. I didn’t deserve it but I was still very thankful for it. I honestly probably wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for him. He also was able to show me hope through Jesus. It wasn’t easy and I resisted for a long time. Eventually though I realized that it was Jesus working though Joshua for me. What grace and mercy I was given!!

About 18 months. I had the story idea in the early autumn of 2004 and began work on it in December that year. I was offered a two-book deal by Oxford University Press in February 2006. It was the publishing that took a long time: almost two years from acquisition to publication.

Besides that, it was mentioned that pressure from the media often makes a lot of these stereotypical attributes appear to be truer than they really are. The Media Awareness Network has also explored the problems surrounding the media’s portrayal of gender stereotypes:
He explores a theme of death and life using a humble tomato, then Jesus and moving on finally to ourselves. There isn’t an obvious connection but he happily weaves one. It seems that it is a knitting together of Matthew 10:39 and John 12:24 that helps the flow. The former text’s conclusion is “whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
Unlike his colleague, PETE MARLEY, Commissioning Editor for Picture Books, wanted to be a psychologist at first, having studied the subject in Nottingham. It was there that he realized psychology wasn’t his thing, and publishing was where he ended up in. He worked for ‘Top That!’ - a small publisher, eventually moving on to Egmont UK. Does he write? He wrote for their Winnie the Pooh range before, as well as ‘Pitstop’ - a satirical take on glossy mags.

And it is not just China here. It was Korea and India before that and Japan before that and Mexico and the American South before that and the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory before that. The delivery chain has gotten longer, and the people who are paying for this are further away. No one you know. But they are still there and if we can simply get people to be as concerned about their well-being as we would be about free-range beef and cruelty-free veal, then we've made a needed step forward. Which, I think, is the place where Daisey is going to.
However, I have some real difficulties with this book. First, the author seems to have simplified the issue of parenting "good" kids (which she labels in chapter 2 as kids who ultimately "don't feel good") into a simple equation: be intentional and you'll end up with no regrets when you send them out into the world as an adult. I don't know. I think that being intentional about the job of raising children to be responsible adults of good character is important, but I think there's a lot more to doing the job well using the quick 7 step idea program laid out by the author. She just tosses out the "do this" and you'll "get this" with too much ease.

But as with any alteration in an ecosystem, you can never do just one thing. What will the unintended consequences of such mass eradications be? The writer of the article cited above does acknowledge that mosquitoes are part of the food chain and their decline could affect birds and fish. He says that could have consequences for pollination since birds are part of this process for some plants. He also suggests such eradications might open a niche for an even nastier creature.

He’d always been good. He’d take the children every other weekend and I’d tell myself I'd catch up on some sleep but, more often than not, I’d hit the bottle instead. And then I’d go out and find others to drink with. I’m not proud of that - far from it, but it was a BAD period in my life and I had no idea how else to deal with it, especially as I had no family around to support me, and my friends were all busy with their own families. I just needed escape, I guess. In fact, I think at that point, if it hadn’t been for a friend’s partner, who was a recovering alcoholic, pointing out that I'd also started drinking during the week once the kids were in bed, too, I may well have become an alcoholic myself. I'd thought the alcohol would make me face my fears and help me sleep, but of course it didn't. It was that day that I poured away any alcohol I had and vowed not to use it as an escape again. I should add at this point, that regardless of how much I drank and how hard I was partying, the children never saw me in that state.

Even the high end travel scale in Vietnam is reasonable. In Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, I treated my traveling companions to a nice night out and was determined to spend $100 on the three of us. After drinks at the Saigon-Saigon bar on top of the elegant Caravelle Hotel, we enjoyed a meal at the Temple Club, a renovated former Chinese temple, where we retired to their drawing room for dessert and coffee. It was only with a large tip that I was able to spend the last of my $100.

By believing in me, they have become a kind of mentor.

Don’t give away too much about your personal life
I am a very solitary person. I have always preferred solitude to being in a group of people, I find always being in someone else’s company completely draining, and i feel like I’m going mad. Now, this flatmate doesn’t give me the space I need. I’m going for a walk so that I can clear my head, listen to some music, get some fresh air? She will tag along, wanting to make useless small talk about how the flowers smell so lovely, or that she doesn’t like this part of town because it smells a bit, or isn’t it hot today? Or at university, for example, I mentioned that I was enjoying one of my classes, so she signed up for it too, despite it being a third year linguistics class, and she is a law major. Or when her classes finish two hours before mine, she won’t go home after class, but instead will wait for me to finish class so that all the way home I have to listen to her complain about how it’s too sunny, or too cold, or too smelly, or too much traffic… I know I sound bitter, but I guess this is the point here we differ the most: she doesn’t seem capable of living without someone by her side every moment of the day, while the exact same thing would lead me to leap off a building before something snaps and I end up stabbing her or something…
After getting kicked out of Mike’s place for upsetting the trivia gods, we moved on to Ollies. Somewhere between the point when I found out that half of my program is sleeping together, and deciding we were all going to hate the rest of our lives, we came up with a plan to sail away to Fiji and live on a boat together instead. Eventually one classmate’s concerned wife came into Ollies to fetch him (in her pajamas). Apparently she is also the ex fiance of my professor. Awkward moments ensued. I couldn’t make this shit up if I tried.

“‘Private property’ as conceived under the liberalistic economic order … represented the right of the individual to manage and to speculate with inherited or acquired property as he pleased, without regard for the general interests … German socialism had to overcome this ‘private,’ that is, unrestrained and irresponsible view of property. All property is common property. The owner is bound by the people and the Reich to the responsible management of his goods. His legal position is only justified when he satisfies this responsibility to the community.”

I am very partial to blues in general, but I think the colours we obtained from the black beans were my favourite. I always thought blue were quite complicated to obtain from natural dyes, requiring indigo or woad and their long and complex fermentation process. Black beans offer a much easier alternative and I can’t wait to try more different types. I have picked up in a French supermarket some black beans from the US and will be testing those at some point against the ones from Thailand which we used in this experiment.

The church porch vigil is something I have still to experience, after all everyone’s experience and explanation of such events is different.

Either way I could do nothing but hold my hands up, surrender and admit defeat and see the funny side…there’s always next year…

In a small bowl, whisk well the butter, milk, yogurt, egg and remaining ginger. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined – do not overmix. Scoop the batter into 9 holes of the prepared muffin pan – the batter should be slightly mounded above the edge. Lay one or two slices of peach over each muffin. Fill the empty cavities of the pan halfway with water before placing it in the oven.

We can know from the foregoing that within two years of now, the present overhang of viable new dwelling units will be exhausted and unless housing construction activity is revived in time, shortages will once more present with resulting upward pressure on prices.
Another aspect that registered with me was her depiction of the naïveté leading up to WWI. As part of one’s manhood it was very much expected that you would go off and fight whether you wanted to or not. There was also a measure of arrogance in the belief that Britain was invincible, and so, like Nicholas, many went “to get it over” by Christmas. Like Nicholas, however, they soon discovered that trench warfare was a very different war from anything they had experienced. The gruesomeness of it almost defies description, but I think the author has captured enough of it to give the reader the idea without emphasizing the macabre.

Upon returning to the States, Don went to California with the Sam Donahue band to record "Command Performance", "Mail Call," etc. for airing to the troops overseas. With the advent of VJ Day, he was discharged from the Navy in Washington, D.C. and returned to Chicago to rejoin Les Brown. During this time he also worked for Benny Goodman. Jacoby decided to settle in Chicago and went on staff for ABC performing on first trumpet with the Don McNeill Breakfast Club for 9 1/2 years. Soon after joining ABC, Don's second son John was born, and then Bill, his third son. While in Chicago, Jacoby did many TV shows, including the Martin and Lewis Comedy Hour, the Ed Sullivan Show and numerous local shows: the Bob and Ray Show, the Danny O'Neill Show and the Tom Duggan Show.

UCSD physics professor Tom Murphy does something I was always curious about and calculates the MPG conversions for walking and biking. The conversion is based on the energy density of gasoline burned in cars vs. food energy burned in muscle. "Long-haul" walking comes in at 40 MPG eating regular food; running will be less efficient than that. A Prius is more efficient in energy terms than a runner.

I think it hit Holly & I at the same time - during our last dinner together at SNAP. Matt Townsend, the amazingly hilarious relationship coach kinda put things into perspective for us. And as we looked back, so did many other presenters and women throughout the weekend. So many discussions were about how to balance blog & family time, and how our kids will grow up so fast. It was so empowering to be in a room with hundreds of other women, most of them moms, who were all trying their best to figure it all out. To do as much as they can but always remember what matters most.
And so it is with the teachings of the Satanic Book of the Koran. So it isn’t any wonder why they see our children as meat.

It’s been a little while since my last post. In the interim, I’ve started a new semester of school. That’s always interesting. Anyway, to refresh your memory as well as mine, I’m going through the seven letters in Revelation addressed to seven churches in Asia directly from the mouth of Jesus, transcribed by the apostle John. I’ve been writing things about “themes” and “patterns.” Basically, look out for the very first thing and the very last

And then, right before my 3:30 class I was eating lunch in the classroom and got kicked out by one of the administrators because eating in 15th century palaces is strictly forbidden. Whatever, I went to eat on the curb…and Ari walked right past me. What?! Florence isn’t the largest city, but it’s still a city, and the odds of her walking down the street right in front of me at the exact time that I was there were not great. I took this as a sign and ran over for a hug. Of course, the reunion couldn’t last long because I had to go learn about Italian cinema, but it’s nice to know that the world’s smaller than you’d think.

This means swallowing water is a far less effective way to fight cavities than brushing with fluoridated toothpaste.”

Since Griffin became leader in 1999 the BNP has been contained when it was riding a wave and now is being destabalised. The tide turned for the BNP in 2001, due to media promotion and hard work of organisers in Olhdam and Burnley. Two areas Griffin has destroyed.
Sounds really fiscally responsible, Right? Tom points out that this is simply allowing the government to overtax us and not account for it. Remembering how VDOT suddenly found it had saved all that money after all, let's just say I'm skeptical at this point.
My absolute fav part of this site is the amount of templates to choose from. The styles are exactly to my personal liking and you could easily customize banners and other things. I would highly recommend EZShoppes for their user friendly site, low prices and great customer services.

I am back with another Pals Paper Arts Challenge Entry! I am just loving the challenge that Pals Paper Arts offers my crafting heart! I do have to admit that I like the colour challenges a bit better than the sketches, because I feel like I am better able to be creative with the colours. But I do still like the sketches. It always helps me open up and use different stamp sets and often colour schemes that I normally wouldn't! If you haven't played in any challenges before, this is one that is super enjoyable and shouldn't be missed!!

This haunting “fictional biography” focuses on a figure who has fascinated countless fans for decades: Marilyn Monroe. In Blonde, Joyce Carol Oates uses the objectification Monroe experienced to explore what her inner life might have been like—the thoughts and feelings that even those closest to her were not privy to. Going far beyond the simplistic summaries of Monroe as a sex symbol or a “girl who wanted to be loved”, Oates wrestles with the complexities and contradictions of her life, providing a fresh, intriguing perspective on the famous actress and model.

Last week the government proclaimed the wonderful news that the jobless rate fell from 8.3% to 8.2%. Great. What they didn't tell you was that to achieve that statistic they simply stopped counting 1.2 million unemployed who have dropped off the radar and atre simply not working/not looking for work/effectively disappeared. There are fewer working now than last month. That's the ugly truth. There are fewer working now than in 2008. Plans by corporations for job cuts are up 28% from last year.
Daniel Goldstein, spokesman for Develop Don’t Destroy Brooklyn, was listening nearby, and soon denounced Stuckey's "not liking tall buildings" statement as “gobbledygook,” adding that community concerns extended to “extreme density,” “massive taxpayer subsidies,” eminent domain, and several other issues.

i’ve got a very real loathing of the whole Ripper industry, in particular those seriously disturbing ghouls who enhance the Mary Kelly photo to emphasise the extent of her mutilation and post the results on casebook.org, but I read the first edition cover to cover and thought it was great. Now it looks like it’s time for a rematch as there’s a new edition and, but for a very few exceptions, i can no longer remember which articles did it for me back in 1999 and why? Simon Whitechapel’s piece on the occult symbolism of it all (dropped from the 2008) certainly stayed in my mind as it totally bamboozled me, but, far more my type of thing, M. J. Trow’s The Way To Hell builds up a strong case against philanthropist Frederick Charrington – only to dismantle it at the last when he admits the whole piece has been a conceit to demonstrate how easy it is to invent your own Ripper suspect. And then there’s the Barbours who seem to think Dr. Barnado had more to do with it than you might think ….

Computers and cell phones now have a life time of less than two years, meaning that 400 million electronic units were thrown out in 2010, and these numbers will only increase as the development of new technologies does as well. This means continuing to flood landfills with toxic elements that will not biodegrade. To make matters even worse most of this eWaste is exported to developing nations where they do not have the garbage disposal infrastructures to be able to handle this kind of toxic waste. These regions often do not have regulations or high working standards, which makes it cheaper for industrialized nations to dispose of their electronic waste in this way. Oftentimes this results in plastics being burned, which releases toxins into the atmosphere, as well as large volumes left in landfills, which allows heavy metals to contaminate the area and harm many different kinds of life.

What I would like to know, is how much it costs the city to keep police officers at the local Wal-Mart in South Philly for security purposes. Also, how much extra does it cost to have them there in higher numbers during the Holiday season. Why can't Wal-Mart hire it's own security? That would create more jobs for unemployed people and less police officers will be up at Wal-Mart laughing & joking, instead of patrolling the streets.
To run out of refreshments at a party or to not have enough hamburgers for a summer cookout might be an embarrassing moment for a modern-day host.

Four and a half weeks until school is over. Despite the relatively safe haven that my son's preschool has been and my concerns over what kindergarten may bring, I can't wait. I'm sick of dealing with those people, tired of constantly hectoring my child to do better, better, better when he's actually a pretty good kid and he's made amazing progress. Can't we just go play in the mud and ride little trains for awhile? I guess I'm burned out. Maybe everybody is.

Excellent throughout - highly recommended.

I’ve sort of kept tabs on select committees ever since joining the civil service, but they have come into their own in recent years – first of all the banking crisis, then with the hacking inquiries combined with the more powerful and independent select committee chairs. My first blogpost on select committees was made prior to attending two events in Parliament. I wrote An audience with the Hansard Society following the first select committee event as a follow-up, swiftly followed by The Impact and Influence of Select Committees, and a further follow-up post at the end of October. Reporting on the events in one select committee was this astonishing piece where a serving civil servant was compelled to give evidence under oath as the Public Accounts Committee fired a broadside at HMRC.

I am a lifelong activist, so there are many... right now, I want to continue the work Occupy Wall Street (and Occupy movements throughout the country) have started, particularly the strengthening of local networks (especially here in conservative SC) and progressive communities. Occupy and its various accompanying social networks have given us the tools, and we must stay connected and involved. KEEPING PEOPLE'S SPIRITS UP (in the face of unbridled right-wing attacks) is crucial right now, and that is something I am concentrating on too.

The bankomat belongs to one of the local banks and I normally go around 9:00 in the morning - the cash may well have run out overnight and not been replenished, so I do not blame Biedronka.

My hope to improve my familiarity with and respect for the chain has been completely eliminated.
The other day, we stood in the cleared patch between strips of trees, the one that's flooded right now because of spring, and is home to a host of amphibians and other wildlife. We looked at the power lines, stretching away as far as the eye could see. That's why there are no trees there, only scrub and marshes. We were watching the sun set, watching the sky turn orange and pink and sunset perfect. "Can you imagine what the view would be like without the power lines?" I said wistfully. "We'll never get to see that." My companion replied with sadness. I told him I wasn't so sure about that. I often wonder if things will start coming down within my lifetime. If things will start shifting and changing in major ways. Sometimes, the idea terrifies me.

During a party scene we have a black female character playing a French Baronesse and society lady. Absolutely nothing is made of her skin colour and she fits neatly into the dinner table round. While this may no longer raise an eyebrow it is remarkable for a film of its time.

So far, what we've got sounds kind of scary, in a brainwashing scene from a bad 60s spy film kind of way. You've got a constant rasp or buzz, perhaps filled out with rushing or rumbling. It may be quite a rich-sounding rasp or buzz, but it's still too basic to listen to for long periods.

He also challenged the congregation to ask themselves if there were any places in their lives that God Himself had to act… places where if He doesn’t act, everything will fall apart… places where He can use your life to prove His power and His glory. For me, that place is this entire season. I HATE change. There is nothing that frightens me more than the thought of fundraising and financial instability. But when God is clearly leading me to move, change, and grow, I desire to run toward His call.
In fact, looking over the Latin, it’s quite clear that the former translation didn't even attempt to be literal. So the question clearly isn't "is it a better translation," if "better" is defined in terms of accuracy vis-à-vis the Latin. The question is "is a more accurate translation desirable?" For many that question will seem like a no-brainer. Of course we want to stay as close to the Latin as possible. And yet, I think it's valuable to use these changes as an opportunity to examine the value of the Latin Mass and ultimately the nature of the Mass itself. I think that the conclusions might be startling.
Which support for government at an all - time low Athens is using the police force more and more to deal with the fallout from its reforms, a policy that is fraught with risk and the potential for re-igniting the large scale violence that Greece witnessed in December 2008 when a 15 year old was shot by a police officer. Already the Keratea region in Attica has been the centre of widespread and violent clashes between inhabitants and police for over three weeks. Villagers in Ovriokastro have fought standing battles, blocked roads,beseiged the local police station and set fire to patrol cars in an effort to block the construction of a rubbish dump in the area. In reply riot police units have repeatedly employed tear gas, plastic bullets and water canon in an attempt to allow building to go ahead.

Then came along an inspiring and handsome kiddo, named Daniel Arce. Daniel was diagnosed with osteosarcoma at age 15, in 2003. He spent 4 years fighting, with 29 rounds of chemo and 9 surgeries. This means he spent a lot of time hospitalized with adult patients. The boy, who wanted to become a doctor, became a man who wanted to learn about finance, so he could make money to build a better, in hospital, experience for adolescents with cancer. He began creating a plan that incorporated creating a room with things appealing to a teenager... Flat screen tv, Wii, brightly painted walls, redone bathrooms, and a computer. He began raising money, but passed away at the age of 20, without the chance of seeing the final results of his legacy. His family recognized the importance of completing his project and created Proyecto Daniel (Project Daniel)...

While I was pleasantly napping on my couch, Ms. Knoxious was secretly drinking FREE Dogfish Head beer and watching Chuck Prophet AT THE SAME TIME! I had every plan for that to be my afternoon! See, The Ms. Knoxious and I had a bit of a row when I found out that when she said "I don't really feel like watching music this afternoon" that she really meant, "I'm going to see free music this afternoon after you've made plans". Yes, my congested head briefly exploded and I said something like, in summary, "Argghh...ahhhh...dammit...no you're going...I'm going to take a nap (and somehow watch the kids)". This, seriously, is the best thing that could have happened....I'm not kidding. My head was aching, my nose stuffed, my spirit broken.

But, before we can get into that, a word or two is needed on a few terms of bearing. Using jail records to look at the relationship between race and the state requires I be clear about what I mean about those terms, and about criminality or crime as well. And, when we put those terms in to the shifting context of the period under consideration, I need to be clear that the things those terms describe change in the course of that period.
Part of the reason for so many pressing reforms through state government is because of the most important event in New York history -- the consolidation of the boroughs, slated to take effect on January 1, 1898.

Second Story: I was looking into getting a new remote control for my TV. On boxing day, I went onto the Future Shop online store. I found the remote I wanted on sale! Great! I went to place my order but the website wouldn’t recognize my postal code. My wife and I moved into our house about a year ago. Okay… new house, new area, new postal code… I’ve never had any trouble with this before from other online stores, so I picked up the phone and called Future Shop customer support. The lady said that she couldn’t take my order because I was giving the incorrect postal code. I explained that the postal code was real. She responded again by saying, “I guess we can’t help you then. Thanks for calling Future Shop”, and then she hung up.

We spent a lovely New Years Eve with our neighbors. We enjoyed a nice meal out, a trip to the ice rink, and some dessert and bubbly afterward. It was so much fun to see how the boys continue to improve in their skating, and how much team effort it took to get Gabriella around the rink a few times on her skates. She loves it and keeps asking to go back. We ended the evening with a very very late movie with our cuddly kids, and slumber party with the boys. It was a great way to start the new year!

Next, lets think about the act of the preparation of food to be cooked. You have to cut up the vegetables, prepare the meat or whatever food you are going to ingest. Then the food must be cooked. Each time you prepare a meal, it is a ceremony. You are preparing food to nourish your physical body and all the other bodies that comprise you. Nutritionists often say that there are certain foods that are good for the eyes, good for the brain, the nerves, and so forth. And so if you think about the process of preparing to cook the meal, that as you go through the steps of preparation, there should be thoughts of thanksgiving for the food. When the food is cooked and served, there is always a need for blessing it, for giving thanks for it, and for all the kingdoms of life that have given of themselves so that you might be nourished. You may do this aloud or silently.
But few of us have seen any progress on this front.

In The Lost Book of Mala R., Rose MacDowell introduces Mala, a gypsy girl in Texas in the 1940s, who is kicked out of her clan for causing disaster. She was like a bad luck charm to her people, and they wanted her gone. She hitchhikes to California to find the woman who had helped raise her for a short time, who had provided her with enough education that she could write a journal. She fills her journal with spells, recipes, predictions, and a jumble of thoughts.

Come summer, white becomes red
I first thought to write, "What a shame that it's a seasonal!" But as with the seasons, and more so the holidays, the anticipation and waiting for something truly heightens my pleasure of finally experiencing it. Christmas all year long would be a drag; but I look forward to the holiday season (that I officially put at Halloween, screw the marketers and their September pumpkins/costumes/candy). That could be part of the reason Sam Adams' Octoberfest didn't quite feel right in AUGUST, even as I drank it in my local watering hole anyway. So while I'll be sad when the winter Celebration beer takes Tumbler's place on the shelves in a few months, it will give me something to look forward to in next year's dog days of summer.

So, we went round the whole discussion again: Audi should replace this, the car is clearly not safe to drive so isn't ready to pick-up! This time I was told that it was a long time ago that the replacement dashboards were done for free (in fact I'd found that a memo was sent in April 2009 telling agents that the criteria had been toughened-up, see one of the links below), I pointed out that, when I first took my car to the Audi garage they replaced the coil packs at no cost because of an existing fault in this component (okay, cheaper item but probably harder to do the work for them, dash is easy apparently). They suggested that later repairs had been done with Audi making a contribution to this cost, I said that would be a much better option providing it was a pretty big contribution as £900 (or even £800) is ridiculous. They said they'd talk to someone higher up.

I would add that the relief can also come simply because a decision has been made and a direction has been chosen. I am not certain of the root of this false teaching historically, but it likely includes a misunderstanding of Philippians 4:6 – 7
At that exact moment, the C.I.C. was rocked as the ship endured a massive explosion. Sparks shot out from multiple terminals, glass shattered and the lights flickered. Many of those serving in the Command Information Center were thrown from their posts or from where they had been standing. Bodies flew with debris as a succession of explosions rocked the ship.

The moments on Friday evening, sitting next to that river were just what I needed. I sat, taking in the peaceful energy, centering myself and remembering the times I had sat next to this river before and after great climbs with great friends before standing up and heading back to the community center for the pre-race meeting. As I made my way into the building I saw my friend Phil and his wife. Ironically, the last time I had been out there was with Phil before heading up to climb Antero more than a year before, so it felt like things in the universe were clicking, good omens were everywhere! We sat through the pre-race meeting, chatting here and there and then took a quick walk while Phil gave me the low down on parts of the course I needed to be aware of then parted ways.
There are some time zone changes coming up around the world, so double-check these times against your local area:
I attended two of them, one of which was a gathering of mothers from my daughter's school (! There were shots! OF TUACA!), and the other was a nice get-together with Karla May and the Malcontent Mama, and their darling daughters. With that kind of invitation, YG of course could not resist coming with, and - voila, a BIG GIRL PARTY ensued.
I am not putting myself under pressure any more. I absolutely love writing and have no intention of stopping, but I am going to keep writing stories. This fits in with my life as it is now. In the future I have no doubt this will change. When the time is right, I will do it - but because I WANT TO and MUST, not because I'm feeling I should.
Review of the weeks numbers and letter, and then a field trip that ties into both the weekly theme and the lessons. Also, during the week I’ll make snacks based on the theme – and plan to watch either a movie or read books based on the theme as well, and we have a daily weather board too.
Remember my little hey-let's-break-the-law-and-send-booze-thru-the-USPS episode? My sister-in-law returned the favor by sending me some Brooklyn brew. I received a bottle of Brooklyn Brewery's Black Ops Imperial Stout last week. I waited for the right moment to break it open, which turned out to be Sunday, the night before my husband and I had to return to work after 10 consecutive days of vacation. Aaaannnnnd, thud. But I slept very well.

Through some more asinine dream-to-reality transitions and jumpy schizophrenic directing, Trevor gets taken in for the murder of some woman and the cops are even less credible than the ones in Hobo with a Shotgun. That’s incredible. They lock him up in the basement of their torture chamber, because yeah, in the Hellraiser films police stations just always have torture chambers built into them, and then we get…well, probably the strangest thing I’ve ever seen in one of these movies:

Iris Dunleavy is the wife of a souther plantation owner. She is duped into the belief that her husband’s slave labor would be temporary, a “necessary evil”. However, she is a vociferous and recalcitrant partner in the marriage, an image contrary to proper behavior in Southern society. When she witnesses the brutal treatment of a young slave, she is unable to stand the torture. She throws herself in front of the bloodied youth to prevent further lashes of the whip. This does not bode well with her husband and he reprimands her. Later, when she helps a group of slaves to escape, her husband is infuriated and convinces a Virginia judge to declare her insane. She is sent to Sanibel Asylum, to be rehabilitated into a more compliant wife, cooperative and gentile.
The answer wasn’t straightforward—there are as many different approaches as there are countries—but it was nonetheless astonishing to me. There are far too many places in the world where kids don’t get enough to eat at school or elsewhere, or what they eat isn’t healthy, but in a surprising number of nations, citizens and governments have prioritized feeding kids a school meal. Places like Japan and France, Finland, Italy, Russia and India have taken on this responsibility because they believe that school meals will help kids grow and learn and become good citizens.

Focus on creating peace and harmony in your relationships. Be truthful and honest with yourself and decide whether any of your relationships are raising you up or bringing you down. If they are bringing you down, and you are not prepared to release them at this time, how can you cultivate them into something that uplifts you, for surely if you are not feeling uplifted, neither is the other person, and while you are not responsible for the other person directly, you are responsible for and to yourself. So, look deep in your heart and listen to the message it shares back (a voice that speaks to you only in love, ONLY in LOVE). Look for the gift and how you can build upon that to create a better, more loving and relationship. Trust what your heart tells you and act upon that divine wisdom.

So my first foray into the world of Brandon Sanderson was a resounding success. ’Warbreaker’ had me reading late into the night, returning me to my teenage years. Since I now have goblins of my own, who are more than happy to wake me up at 6am, staying up until after 1am to finish a book is just about the highest compliment I can pay. If ‘Warbreaker’ is not Sanderson’s best book, then I can’t wait to read the others.

Oh god, shes so hot it hurts. I love this. Nicole is so apt for swimwear so this works perfectly in her favor. The mall rat hair actually looks good, she looks super tall (She was already 5’11″, making her the tallest girl this season) and her stomach looks crazy toned. I really love her bod here, she looks amazing in that cut and the color works perfectly with her tan. Her face, a thing Nicole often had problems with, actually looks quite nice here. Great start for a great girl.

Hello! Did this weekend fly by or what? I am telling you it can no way be another week starting so soon. I wanted to share a few of things I have been busy with this weekend. Hope everyone has a wonderful week. You will see some stuff on the floor in one of the photos. The rooster picture leaning against the wall is waiting to have a touch up done. I am going to paint around the frame red. The stuff laying in the floor is there temporarily, Its the starting of a Goodwill donation. I forgot to remove it before I took the picture. Kitchen Nook I changed my eating nook around a little this weekend. I had a yard long rose picture hanging on the wall. I changed it out for this bright rooster print. I also added a white battenburg lace table cloth. I put some sunflowers in a vase and place it in the center of the table.

It's in the same vein as the Little House on the Prairie books, although I would say it really isn't in the same league as that series.

Evaluation of U.S. military source points of radioactive waste must include the following discrepancy: The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Integrated Data Base for 1994 (U.S. Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Inventories, Projections and Characteristics) lists military high-level wastes as 957,900,000 curies as of Jan. 1, 1995, as well as an additional 2,670,000 curies of transuranic wastes (TRUW) (pg. 15). These wastes are listed primarily as tank wastes(liquid and solid) at four U.S. locations: Hanford, WA; Idaho National Engineering Laboratory; the Savannah River site; and the West Valley, New York former fuel reprocessing facility (24,700,000 Ci is still at this location). In view of the 30,200,000,000 Ci of spent nuclear fuel accumulated by the commercial nuclear industry as of Jan. 1, 1996, a question for the next millennium is: Where are the other billions of curies of spent nuclear fuel derived liquid high-level wastes which the U.S. military (Department of Energy) has generated since the production of nuclear weapons began in 1945?

This week I just caught myself thinking WOW! This is where it is at. I decided to finish at my other job as I had trained in social work and I really wanted to sink my teeth into something more social work specific. Well my new job is just that! Yesterday there were 3 things that happened that were highlights. I met with a young guy who has been disengaged from school for quite some time, and by disengaged he hasn't attended for quite some time...possibly over a year and when he has he's found himself in a fair bit of strife. He is 12. But over the past few weeks I have been meeting with him at the library and working on his reading, writing and maths. And he is coming ahead in leaps and bound. He wouldn't meet with me at first and now he churns the work out like a little champ! And little by little I hope he may transition to our school campus. While I was working with him yesterday I got a text from the mother of another young guy I was meeting a couple hours later saying he would not be attending. Which didn't shock me but it was disappointing. I couldn't call her back straight away but when I did she said no he will meet you, expect him at 12. And he churned out some good work too! He is a really smart kid but due to so many reasons has not been able to attend mainstream school. But that is one of his goals...and a big factor holding him back at this time is drug abuse...but it was so positive to have him meet me and engage with me for a little bit. While I was finishing up with him I got a call from a fellow youth worker/case manager saying a student had rocked up at school and would I be back soon. This young guy has sort of flitted in an out of school over the past couple of weeks. He's found himself homeless and had a bit of trouble with the law. He pretty much was trying to put out fires all over the place where things were going pear shaped big time. But we talked some things through and made a plan to meet today to get the ball rolling with legal aid and applying to change a bail condition. I felt like we kicked some goals...AND the sweetest thing when I was said goodbye to him today and that I'll see you Monday at school he said "Lauren thanks so much for your help today I really appreciate it!"

Some of you may know that the past months since I graduated have been pretty tough for me. I struggled a little financially because I did not have work after I graduated (but thank God for Joel and my parents, who willingly supported me during that period of time!). I struggled emotionally, as it was hard leaving Arkansas, my home for 4 years, to go to a city that was new to me. And I also struggled spiritually, as I dealt with God’s plan for my future.

The best way to tackle a tantrum is to ignore it, Dr. Leman says. "When your child is throwing a tantrum, the purpose is to get attention and to exert authority over you. And if throwing tantrums has worked in the past, your child will continue to throw them in the future." Dr. Leman's suggestion is to step over the child, totally ignore the behavior, and move on with whatever else you were doing. Nine times out of 10, your child will get up and follow you. If you're in public, don't be so worried about what other people will think -- this is about nipping this bad behavior in the bud.

Well they claim to have made the first beer without malted barley just as Bard's tale has said. Well I don't really care who was the first. New Grist is my absolute favorite of the three. It is very light and refreshing and they do a good job at making it taste most like an actual malted barley beer. I have read other reviews where people have just ripped it, and I don't get it. Yea it may not have the flavor of an Imperial Stout but they did a great job of making something flavorful for the gluten intolerant crowd and I commend them for it.
But his intuition was continuously telling him that something was surely wrong. It’s just that he couldn’t figure out the something, and THIS was bothering him. He finally decided to give up and go for a stroll instead. The weather was cold when he walked up to his terrace. His breath came out in little puffs as he watched the early rays of the sun rising beneath the wispy clouds. The mellow orange colour of the sun looked beautiful against the light blue sky. The soft breeze fanned his cheeks and it was so enchanting. The chirping of birds seemed like a melody in itself. In fact, it added more beauty to the ambience. For a moment, he forgot all his worries. All the doubts and intricacies got dissolved in this tranquil atmosphere. This is why he loved coming to his terrace.

I love fajitas, but have never been brave enough to try to recreate them myself (the whole here they come on a giant sizzling plate dripping in juicy-ness thing can be a little intimidating, right?). The typical cut of beef used for steak fajitas is flank steak or skirt steak,. But if you're a woman who knows very little about cuts of steak like me, you might pick up the wrong cut of beef at the grocery store because it was stocked on the wrong shelf... so here I am with 2 lbs of boneless beef chuck steak. Two completely different parts of the cow. The challenge with boneless beef chuck steak is its from the shoulder of the cow and is tough and needs to be marinated and slow cooked to break down the connective tissue. This recipe requires marinating and slow cooking (braising) the steak in a dutch oven so it's fall apart by the time dinner comes around.

This can be further seen from Christ’s statements that he gives eternal life to his sheep and that he is one with the Father in preserving them since none can pluck his flock from out of their hands.

Bruised, Holly tries to put it behind her until a chance encounter brings her feelings to the surface again.

Evidently, the posts I like best are the ones where I get on my soapbox. And by the way, I still think the one on beauty is probably the best post I've ever done, and not just me--fellow YA Highwayer Kristin Otts started the idea and it spread around the internet for a few days, which was amazing. Alright, so those are mine, what about yours? Visit YA Highway to link and see others' greatest posts!
Gabriel Silva gave an impassioned interview to Colombian newspaper El Tiempo where he criticised the American government’s handling of the scandal which saw federal agents buying hookers.
Rom 11:17-21 (Phi) But if some of the branches of the tree have been lopped off, while you, a shoot of wild-olive, have been grafted in, and share like a natural branch the rich nourishment of the root, don’t let yourself feel superior to the former branches. If you feel inclined that way, remind yourself that you do not support the root, the root supports you. You may make the natural retort, “But the branches were lopped off to make room for my grafting!” Very well, then. They lost their position because they failed to believe. The situation does not call for conceit but for a certain wholesome fear. If God removed the natural branches for a good reason, take care that you don’t give him the same reason for removing you.

We headed off down Koningstraat, looking for the baker’s shop at number 37. It was built in 1900 and has a stone sculpture of a baker above the shop door. It is no longer a baker, it sells antiques, but was not open.
Our last morning we drove to this wonderful bakery and we had a pastry and coffee! Just look at what we had to choose from ! I just had to take a picture of the 2 Mother's Day cakes and had on display.
Which, by the way, I read on AN AIRPLANE!! Too bad I already had my rock star of a husband next to me and couldn’t have a real fantasy. Too bad I wasn’t in seat 3B waiting for a hot rock star. OK, my husband might not be a ‘rock star’ but come on, he’s HOT! See:
"For the longest time I was trying to figure out a way to get Donny on our show, but the way luck has it, I appeared on his. It was such a ball, that I really felt guilty taking a pay check," Kristy said with a big laugh. "You know something funny," she continued to say. "I'm only normal. How many other girls my age feel the same way about Donny as I do? There are many and you might say that I'm one of the group."

The Court thus constitutes the judicial authority of the European Union and, in cooperation with the courts and tribunals of the Member States, it ensures the uniform application and interpretation of European Union law. The Court of Justice of the European Union, which has its seat in Luxembourg, consists of three courts: the Court of Justice, the General Court (created in 1988) and the Civil Service Tribunal (created in 2004). Since their establishment, approximately 15 000 judgments have been delivered by the three courts".How then should we abbreviate the name of the European Union's top court? "ECJ" is commonly used, standing for"European Court of Justice", an appellation which is both incorrect and liable to be confused with the European Court of Human Rights, since the latter too purports to dispense justice. "CJEU" (for "Court of Justice of the European Union") is technically a blanket term for the not-the-ECJ and two other tribunals, while "CJ" for "Court of Justice" can be confused with a national court and can also stand for "Chief Justice".
Another part of the rehabilitation is training them for a new job, so that they can support themselves. This includes the young women, who often got pregnant. Having a baby out of wedlock is not a big thing in Bantu society, but in Somalia and other strict Muslim societies, they are at risk for being ostracized.

I understand the issues at play here; when I first got my smart-phone I was constantly updating my Facebook or Twitter just because I had thought of something interesting or funny. And, with advances in science and technology, instead of having to wait until I got back to my laptop or computer, I can just instantly record this apparently brilliant thought through my phone.

On Sunday, Mrs Yogic and I went to see Misterman by Irish playwright Enda Walsh at the National Theatre. Performed by just one man in the cavernous space of the Lyttleton, this is the most sublimely affecting theatre I’ve seen in years. Cillian Murphy is an astonishing actor and the star of two of my favourite films of the last fifteen years: Disco Pigs and 28 Days Later. He is at his best in this brilliant play about faith, imagination and memory set in smalltown Ireland.

Now, obviously I wasn’t too thrilled about the idea of her giving herself a haircut, BUT she did a decent job of it. Her hair looked like it had, at one point, been professionally cut, but then had grown out and was now in need of a trim and a tidy, which is exactly what we did the following morning(Tevye was in dire need of a haircut anyways).

Mama Earth is good at filling niches which is really what evolution is about, adapting to the circumstances you find yourself in. So that being said, can pagans adapt or are we going to give up and worship “dirt” by our self-pitying lonesomes or are we ready to embrace change before the world and stand for something bigger than ourselves that we already profess to worship? What have you done for HER lately?

Seamus Murphy, an owner since 1974, has a long-standing relationship in Ireland with trainer/breeder Peter Casey, who trains at Stamullen, Co Meath, close to the Co Dublin border and the town of Balbriggan, where Murphy is based. Among the horses that Casey currently trains for Murphy are Jack The Bus and Fingal Rock. It was Casey who bred Hello Bud, selling him to Murphy early in 2006. Murphy, incidentally, also owned a greyhound called Hello Bud. The horse had some success in Ireland, winning three point-to-points, but in the summer of 2007 Murphy transferred him to David Wintle’s stable in Gloucestershire. Even at that stage, the ambition was a place in the John Smith’s Grand National. Hello Bud won three successive handicap chases while with Wintle, but in 2008 the trainer retired, recommending that Murphy transfer the gelding to the nearby stables of Nigel Twiston-Davies. The agreement was made by phone and although the horse won three of his first five outings after the change of stables, Murphy did not meet his new trainer until the Scottish Grand National in April, 2008. Hello Bud’s victory that day – with £114,000 winning prize money – remains Murphy’s most significant win. Murphy, who has two businesses – sand & quarrying and environmental services – travelled to Aintree to watch Hello Bud finish fifth in the 2010 John Smith’s Grand National. John Smith’s Grand National Record: 2010 Hello Bud (5th); 2011 Hello Bud (PU 29th)
If the I-130 Petition is approved, the next step is applying for the immigrant visa at the embassy/consulate where the foreign spouse resides. Upon the approval of the I-130, the National Visa Center will send an instruction packet explaining the next phase of visa processing and what documents need to be gathered before the foreign spouse’s interview at the embassy/consulate. These documents include an affidavit of support from the U.S. citizen spouse, vaccination records, police certificate(s), and proof of a good-faith marriage (marriage certificate, photos, letters, etc). The immigrating spouse will also be required to under go a medical exam with an Embassy-approved physician.

Every year, most students stagger away from Marx feeling as though he’s less readable (perhaps for different reasons) than a transcript of any presidential address delivered in, oh, I dunno, say, the last eight years. I still consider Marx the most challenging author I’ve read since arriving at Chicago; the guy’s brilliant, yes, but good lord could he have used a better editor. Yet reflecting back on that little discussion at the tail end of dinner, it seems obvious to me that a mastery of Marx is not beyond anybody; all that’s needed is a little combining of sosc class with gym class.

David woke to nothing. He felt something beneath him that was once soft but was now stale and lumpy. All he could smell was soil. Not even soil. Dirt, and it smelled old. All was black with not the tiniest trace of light except for what seemed like lightning when he touched the bump on the side of his head. He was afraid to move because he didn’t know what he was moving from or towards. He listened, turning his head any direction possible, but he heard nothing. It was neither cold nor warm, though it was damp.

This is where our PeruRail train deposited us last night and where we spent the night. As we walked to our hostel last night, I thought it odd that we all had to cross a line of railroad tracks that were, literally, right outside the hostel’s front door, which brings me to my latest bit o’advice…
Floating down into an abyssal darkness which is punctuated by insignificant cones of illumination from the individual lights of your small group of fellow divers, waiting for something other than the descent line to appear in your field of vision, is a deliciously tingly experience. Even an old Bertrand Russell hard-headed pragmatist verging toward an Amazing Randi style cynic like me feels that frisson of alert anticipation when embracing something this outré.
Still looking for that elusive butterfly :) I have a few cookie cutters which look like they'd make gorgeous Tags but seeing them in clay they just aren't inspiring unfortunately. I got a really pretty one from House (a kitchen store) today - on the advice of Kylie Darbey :) - and it was so pretty! But I made a Tag just now and not so great :( That's ok, it'll go in my drawer and I'll make very pretty cookies out of it for my daughter's birthday!

But before we get into the detail, let’s just pause and examine the phrase ‘real opposition’. To be frank, I’ve been frustrated and annoyed by the speed with which – even where lowlife like Murdoch are concerned – people still scuttle back into their Left/Right caves at the first sign of ‘being attacked’.

But all that is clearly too much hassle for the farmer on Common Road. I reckon it was ten years since he last cut those hedges (ironically quite good) - and when the time came that something had to be done, he wasn't going to be worried about the niceties of yellow hammers or bullfinches. Judging by the results of his mechanical flail I don't reckon he's bothered about much in nature at all. He's not only cut the thinner growth, he's slashed the nearby trees, splintered the blackthorn into shards, even smashed his own fences. In all, he reduced the hedge by over six feet.
I don't even know what my fifth word was. And there were pauses. Big pauses. While I could have rattled off all sorts of things that I am, defining myself through antonyms was so much more difficult.
Now, when I read these and believed about what they really meant, it reframed my perception of Google. I have often disliked massive corporations, but perhaps it was time for reconsideration.

Blizzard has to come up with a four cornered approach, which on a graph would have time on one axis and skill on another. Players with a lot of time and a lot of skill have a game to play – it’s end game raiding. Players with little skill and a lot of time have a game to play – they can level over and over. Players with only a little time and a little skill have a game, too – they can do little “30 minuters:” end game normal dungeons, achievements, and world events a little at a time. Right now, though, players with little time and a lot of skill have nowhere to go. We’re the lost quadrant.
This appointment Brody was “officially” diagnosed with Diplegia Cerebral Palsy, a form of CP affecting the legs. He’s always been a bit off when it comes to balance, coordination and such but lately he’s getting worse. His case is mild, thank goodness, but affects his daily life nonetheless. He has trouble with motor planning which makes little things like stepping up and down curbs or different surfaces, running & jumping hard to do. Despite stretching his legs on a regular basis he is becoming tighter and tends to tiptoe more than we’d like.

The death of the Gateway Corridor Project and the impending doom that will befall North Amherst Village Center form based rezoning this coming Monday night is directly attributable to a (mis) perception in town that those worthy projects will create more rowdy student party houses.

The Mary Lou Zeek Gallery will be featuring eleven adventurous photographers from all corners of the U.S. who traveled to Cuba under the guidance off renowned Salem-based photographer-teacher Steve Anchell. The result: an intriguing exhibit of Havana and environs through the collective lens of an intrepid band of Americans. They documented the lives of Cubanos today … their homes and families and life on the streets and countryside. It’s a portrait of a people in transition in a country changing every day. This merry band of photographers were fortunate to be part the Cuban scene as our Caribbean neighbor returns to the limelight.

What was disturbing was the way Leader's sexual abuse of a young girl's dohta or female replicant—to the point of destroying her uterus—was considered merely, in Leader's words, an "outward manifestation of a concept", since she was not an "actual substance". Something must really be wrong in the 1Q84 world if there were young girls like Tsubasa who were "without substance", and their violation was but "one form of a concept". Incest, as well, was treated as a part of this concept. The concept, at bottom, was the sexual turpitude of Leader "possessed" by the power of the Little People. The Little People who were products of dark forces dwelling in the underground of the mind, from which the strands of chrysalis were to take shape and give birth into new "concepts". The dark forces dwelt like parasites in the minds of Leader and the radical members of Sakigake. Murakami was here treading dangerous grounds of his conceived reality, the underground reality in which women are treated as objects, in which morality was an unstable formless substance.

Second is Ashley...she is withdrawing so much lately, I dont know how to reach her. Tonight I was talking to my dad and I told him how she wanted to go to UC Davis and then I said but she wasn't sure cause she doesn't want to leave me, it was a lie. She cant wait to get away from me, and that breaks my heart daily, its one thing to admit it to myself, but a totally different thing to admit to other people. I dont know what I have done to make her so angry at me, why she is so angry at all of us.

It is less common for a student to bring up the tension force unprompted, but it is pretty obvious to them as soon as you start talking about a rope. (If they do bring it up, it is the vague “pull” counterpart to the “push” they gave to start the normal force discussion.) The word tension is fine and sounds like ropes. There is some trouble nailing down exactly how to describe the direction of the force, but a quick sketch on the board of someone pulling something (or whatever) with a rope at an angle heads us right toward the idea of “along the rope”.

I have many conversations with people about my deep desire to move overseas and be a missionary. Sometimes I forget that I have been asked to be a missionary here. I will never forget walking around Wauwatosa one sunny afternoon, praying for my neighborhood, when God clearly said "Serve me here." I was disappointed. I want to sever THERE not HERE.
Back to the animals…while we were there, I got to take an inside peak at the cows they were sending over to the Spring Jersey Sale too. They are all such beautiful cows but one…I would have taken her (and I just might if I can get the winning bid)! It was amazing to see how gentle they were with them and how similar their cows are to the ones we have here. No fussing, no fighting…just a gentle walk up onto the hauler.

First thing on Thursday morning, I got a call from the director of the field crew, letting me know that there were tracks circling the traps and that we should have the field kit ready to go. We were cutting things close; once the bears come out, we shut the traps, and boar grizzlies had already been sighted on the move in Yellowstone and Grand Teton. At best, we had 48 hours before we would have to close the research operation for the year. It would be in keeping with F3′s habits to circle the traps repeatedly a day or two before the end of the season, taunting us with the prospect of a capture, but never actually allowing us to collar her.
I have been super busy today, baking chocolate cake, making vanilla pudding, egg salad and tuna salad. The boys requested a cake today and pudding too since I was in the kitchen.

To be honest, the characters really started to bother me the more I thought about them. I’m used to, and rather tired of, the little boy lost routine, even when it looks as good as Brody does it here (the man should not be allowed to wear contemporary clothing. You’ve seen the internet. You know what I mean.), but it ended up being the ladies that really bugged. Weisz’s Penelope is essentially a mid-30s version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl, a blank slate that Brody’s recovering con man can write his future on. I give Weisz credit for infusing Penelope with as much life and agency as she could, but on paper, the character is a mess. I kept hoping for a third-act reversal that would give Penelope some depth, but no such luck. And perhaps the less said about the eternally silent Bang Bang (Kikuchi), the better. She doesn’t even get to speak in her own language – rather, she sits around looking adorable in kooky couture, trading meaningful looks with the boys and occasionally blowing things up when called upon.

Ugh, I was SOOO looking forward to using our tax refund check, with the added bonus of new baby money, to fund our move into a larger home but somehow we ended up owing money (no we do not have that kind of money) and the only thing saving us is that our state refund ends up being enough to cover it and maybe get us a new, smaller couch. I know I was supposed to re-upholster the one we have now, but let’s be honest, my sewing skills are on par with handing over the presser foot to a toddler and letting them have at it. Good thing is I found some sofas that look promising here that look to be both pet and baby friendly, along with fitting in our tiny living room, providing ample seating AND allowing me the opportunity to re-arrange as I get bored. SCORE! Just keep your fingers crossed that I can sell our living room set!

The practice of using water to flush waste from the colon as a form of therapy dates as far back as 1300 B.C. An ancient Greek medical text called the Eber Papyrus (named after George Eber, a German professor who had the text translated in 1873) extols the virtues of cleansing the colon via the rectum. Early fathers of medicine Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.) and Galen (129-210) were strong proponents of colon cleansing as a medicinal tool. Ambrosio Paré (1517-1590), a French physician, was the first to describe colon hydrotherapy (also known as colon irrigation or colonics) in detail and to differentiate it from an enema.

First time apartment owners and renters purchasing one piece at a time, frequently choose a neutral palette, as they select functional pieces on a budget. It makes sense, as neutral goes with everything. A calm design scheme is desirable in urban settings, as a refuge from the bright lights and big city chaos. Beach houses in these hues merge seamlessly, bringing the outdoors in. Done incorrectly, neutral can telegraph indecision, or lack of effort--read rental. Done correctly with textures, shades layers and sculptural forms, it spells c-h-i-c. Annie deciphers the code for lovers of this aesthetic.

When I first started thinking about the possibility of being able to watch TV on my laptop computer, it occurred to me that once my computer’s battery drained, I would be – so to speak – “dead in the water.” However, I quickly found a solution to that problem, too. For an additional $25.01 I was able to purchase a 12-volt Power/Charger for my little blue Chevy Aveo, and I just tried that out to. I can power up my laptop with the battery removed and still watch and listen to TV programs while in my car, and when I replaced the computer’s battery, the charger began charging the battery. This opens a whole new ballgame. Now, not only could I conceivably use my car to charge my computer’s battery, I could – if necessary – sit in my car and watch the news (or any one of a number of other programs). That’s when the light bulb went off! Not only would I able to watch TV outside of my home, I could in all probability maintain contact with all of my friends in my email address book and/or on Facebook! Don’t you need an Internet connection to do that, you ask? Well, of course you do. A few of you may be fortunate enough to own vehicles that have a built-in Internet port; I don’t! But the world is filled with Cyber Cafes and Internet Cafes and libraries and many other places that make available Internet connections these days (often free). Even my friend, Barb, who lives in Mexico, has sent me photographs of a cyber café in her area. And, although I do not condone using it, when I turn on my computers and check for Internet connection, I usually find two or three unprotected sites that I can connect through. For this reason, I keep my modem well protected and safe-guarded. However, someone once said “any port in a storm!”

The great thing about thrifting is that you can get an authentic mid-century look – if you’re lucky – without the designer price. I live around a plethora of pseudo-retirement communities, which has its major disadvantages. However, one of the pros is that the thrift stores are chock-full of amazing vintage finds. It’s an untapped market here, because the majority of the local thrifters are elders themselves. That leaves folks like me to explore the assortment of fabulous things like pencils skirts and fedoras. I also find some amazing LPs in the record bins at local resale shops, as well as beautiful tea sets and cocktail glasses. Just the other day, I found a never-been-worn bathing suit and a beautiful 1980s green velvet cocktail dress. I was in heaven!

He walked around the room, recited poetry, paced back and forth across the floor, and gesticulated his points with wild arm movements. Sure, it was a little bizarre, but it was also awesome. This guy loves writing. He loves words and telling stories, and he’s extremely good at it. He gave us lots of advice, one of which was to read and memorize poetry out loud. Rest assured I went on Amazon last night and stocked up. One of his recommendations was Dr. Seuss, so I’m looking forward to reciting “One Fish, Two Fish” at a downtown poetry slam.

I try the tactic of encouraging my kids and giving them assistance when they get frustrated, but Little S is NEVER this calm at home! This is the child that screams in frustration when she can’t get on her shoe on the first try. I’ve even enlisted some deep breathing techniques to help her reduce her frustration levels… which helps calm her a bit, but her performance at school was that of an angel!

The other new concoction, just in time for Valentine's Day is JazzBerry Champagne. This one is a white tea blended with just a touch of black tea for jazzed-up raspberry flavor. Along side, you'll find the taste of juicy champagne grape. I love the white teas for their delicacy and great punch of health benefits, and I'm especially liking the addition of just the right touch of flavor, making sure to not overwhelm the delicate tea. What a great way to celebrate Valentine's Day!

A while ago I was talking to someone who knew that I quilted. She is a knitter, and the discussion became whether I knitted as well. I said I did, and mentioned that I had knitted hats, scarfs, mittens, blankets and partially finished sweaters. The one thing I have not tried is socks, so she kindly offered to give me some sock wool and needles so that I could try it.
I know I say this is the best book yet after each book of Tim’s that I read but seriously Dead Flesh rocked it! Your favorite characters Kiera, Potter, Kayla, and Isador are back in Tim’s new Kiera Hudson series and I couldn’t be more pleased. I have been a fan of Tim’s since reading his Black Hill Farm almost a year ago and I have enjoyed watching him grow as a writer. The characters and plots get stronger and his writing gets darker and more intense with each book he publishes.

What helps is that Flanagan frames this novel as Flynn writing his memoirs instead of simply following Flynn through the years. Flynn has a very distinctive voice; practical, wry, but with a heaping handful of melancholy. When Flynn first introduces us to his parents, he suddenly reflects on the fact that, although they’re dead now, he can still hear their voices clearly. This makes Evening’s Empire a sad, although certainly not a dark, novel. All of the Ravons are quite distinct; glamorous rock star Emerson, pretentious artist Simon, and cheerful, mischievous Charlie, who comes into the forefront towards the end of the novel, when Flynn and his family help him through chemotherapy. Danny Finnerty, who isn’t considered a real Ravon because he’s an American replacement, doesn’t figure as much, but, just when I was nervous that Flanagan was ripping on rap for no apparent reason, he unleashes a brilliant defense of the genre that went immediately into my commonplace book. Evening’s Empire is a longish novel—a little over 600 pages—but these characters carry it along throughout the years, as any good family epic should. (Although the short, thriller-esque chapters certainly help.)

Lest you think I'm a complete freak for enjoying beer and ice cream together, I'm not the only one: two of Amy's more famous flavors of ice cream are Shiner Bock and Guinness. I used to live on 34th Street near both an Amy's location and the dearly missed Austin Outhouse, one of the great dive bars of all time. I would always go to Amy's first, and then take my ice cream over to the Outhouse and get a Shiner Bock. Everyone always laughed at me, but then one day I walked into Amy's, and there it was up on the menu board: Shiner Bock ice cream. I could kill two birds with one stone! I took it over to the Outhouse, and everyone said "No way!" Of course, I didn't really kill two birds — I got myself a real Shiner, as well.

Even as the SEIU members were rehearsing their pleas in St. Louis, yet another attack occurred a few hundred miles down the Big Muddy. On April 9 in New Orleans, the Southern Republican Leadership Conference held a dinner at Brennan's Restaurant in the French Quarter. The event generated a protest, as everything seems to do these days. The responsible organization here was the Iron Rail Collective, an anarchist group. The anarchists chased GOP chairman Roger Villeres as he left the restaurant, but this was only the first act. A short time later, fundraiser Allee Butsch and her boyfriend Joe Brown emerged. They were evidently followed and then attacked a few blocks away by at least five people. Both were badly beaten, Ms. Butsch suffering a leg broken so severely as to require an operation.

Not long after we got back from Disney Grandma Paula started making these Mini Albums for Darian and Harley and we loved them so much we ran out and got the supplies we did not have yet and we started making them too. Then they got put on hold a bit because I had to finish the Disney Photo Pass Pictures, and this week we have started working on them again. So my plan is to show you a new Day of Disney Scrap Book Page for Piper and Willow every day so you can slowly see pictures and see the Trip, and all the fun we had!!!
So instead, I went to Sweet Art, a tiny family-owned bakery and café only a few blocks away from the park. I first discovered Sweet Art while I was still in France (ironically enough). I had bookmarked the bakery’s website on my computer, but it wasn’t until I was sitting in my second floor apartment in Orleans, France, sifting through random links, that I read about how the bakery started. As it turns out, the owner, Reine Bayoc, also lived in France for awhile, and went to college in St. Louis. She opened her own bakery/café after working some “life draining cubicle jobs”, and now shares the space with her husband, who is an artist. The interior is bright and airy, and you almost feel like you’re eating in someone’s kitchen.

So last night I threw some chicken together at the last minute and it was gooder than good!! I decided to share my little throwdown (mommy’s fav word) recipe with you all. If I had known how good it was I would have taken a pic. Now a warning… I never measure. I guess that’s the southerner in me… I eye ball and taste it out, so I’m just gonna give you the basics.
Policies such as ObamaCare, tax increases, and other actions that cause regulatory uncertainty all but force the producers and investors to stop moving their money domestically. They have the option of just parking it or investing it inChina, all of which has the effect of transferring the tax burden away from the wealthy onto the working poor and middle class. Democrats are not interested in taxing the wealthy; they are interested in taxing the domestic producer class.
Back to back activities like that wears you out…I don’t recall getting this tired. Does that mean I am getting old?? :-/
The backdrop to all of this activity is quite striking. An enormous television screen broadcasts the morning news just loud enough to be heard without being obnoxious. Bright flower gardens surround elegant stone sculptures, while the Sun Bird Monument towers high above everything.
Who can be grouchy after that? The little things can erase all the ugly from the day so easily.
My dear, wonderful, lovely, passionate, feisty but hurting in ways I don't think anyone could truly understand, mother has passed away. My Momma who always listened to me and has been there for me, even if we were "fighting" always said that she would watch my daughter for my husband and I, because she never really trusted anyone else to do the best job that she could do. Someone that would jump on the bandwagon, when my feelings were hurt or if it looked like I was taken advantage of from someone. A person that made it all better, when I hurt. Weather it was with medication or just getting me a wet washrag and putting it on my forehead when I was sick. Someone that was there at the hospital after giving birth to my own daughter and basically *saved* my life, so I could be a mother today. Someone that I want here with me right now, but can't be. Someone that I know, is in a much better place, but it still sucks for those that loved her and are left behind.
Oh side note: I just visited my friend and her brand new tiny 5lbs 12oz baby girl. Looking at the baby I couldn't imagine how she fit in her momma's belly. She was SO tiny and yet it still looked incomprehensible to me. My children weren't even that small! God really is the ultimate designer. The whole process really blows my mind!

It seems Jade Warrior were trying to really commercialize their sound here and it's telling that an experimental band sound stronger on their more "accessible" stuff than the actual experiments. It's not the best album to define their sound, their 1st album may be, or perhaps their instrumental albums for Island Records but it's the one that leaves the most lasting impression.
Their new Prime Chophouse Burger comes served on toasty onion bun and is piled high with crunchy onion strings (I suppose this isn’t the kind of burger you should choose if you’re going out on a first date). You also have a generous amount of sautéed mushrooms and a horseradish sauce that really isn’t too spicy. I knew that the horseradish sauce wouldn’t have too much of a kick so I added jalepeño peppers to my burger (you can add a bunch of different basic fixin’s to your burger for free and customize it further for an added price). With the melted provolone, country dijon sauce, horseradish sauce, and the juicy patty… I really liked this burger.

-Skip to the point, basically I had told a staff member I thought I had been pregnant once, but I wasn't, but I was glad my boyfriend reacted excitedly rather than upset. However, that particular comment was said after a pregnant woman (in a group of five other pregnant women) asked if I planned on ever having kids. I replied with, "Maybe someday. I thought I was once, but I wasn't. I'm glad my boyfriend was excited about it though!"
I used to draw in pencil first but it is rare now. I had to push myself out of the boat sort to speak and start drawing directly in INK. It's a bit scary sometimes but it gives a certain look to the work that would not be there if I erased some of the line.
While Waid largely plays it safe with this story arc, it isn’t a problem. Its a good, safe, and fun story that reads just like a classic. That’s not to say that it’s written like something from decades ago, it isn’t. But it does have that quality of storytelling that classic comics have. Checcetto does his part in adding to that feeling with his classic style of art.

Marjory, The Trash Heap is a wise being (referred to as an "oracle"), serves as the garbage dump of the Gorgs. She and her heckling heralds live near the Gorg's garden, and she gives the Fraggles guidance and advice, which the Fraggles regard with reverence, although they do not worship her. She also appears to have some magical abilities (specifically telepathy and the ability toteleport items or Fraggles), although she does not often use them. Sometimes she knits to pass the time. She has an uncle named Maximillian, whom she refers to as "Uncle Max". Jerry Nelson voiced Marjory the Trash Heap.

I make a lot of breakfast smoothies, but it was time to figure out some other uses for them.

Of course you can't say any of this to them directly. So I just smile & apologize & ask if I can help with anything else.

2. This blurb is also unique in that it’s the first cover copy we’ve examined where the focus is on the characters rather than the plot and for this to work, we really need to see something original in the character outlines given. What catches my eye for this novel is the fact that Penelope has had a long-time crush on the hero. (I’ve seen this many times since reading this novel but several years ago, it wasn’t as common a construct.) I also like the focus on Colin and his wanting to be viewed as something more than your average charmer. It hints at some interesting character exploration (which actually does occur in the novel).

However, as hard as all of this has been for me, I think it is ten times harder for my husband. There is something inherently tough in women, that makes us flexible and able to re-invent ourselves from time to time. The mere fact that we allow ourselves to feel our emotions also helps us to deal with them. Yes, there are tears streaming down my cheeks as I'm writing this. But at the same time, I'm feeling Laura's joy at reuniting with her beloved Rich.

I believe that's a huge part of a relationship. Being okay independent of the other person. So many people are so desperate to find someone, that they forget to figure out who they are. You cannot be happy with somebody else until you are okay with yourself. I met Travis when I was finally okay with being alone. And because of that, I bring so much more to our relationship. If anything ever happened to either one of us, we would be devastated. But we would pick up and move on, because that's what we have to do. We are such a better couple because we know who we are individually.

Sorry, I gave Kanye a moment to issue his remarks for the new year, now it's time to listen to a man who albeit is less known nowadays, but whom I respect much more...It's interesting to hear his views on exactly why this whole thing is falling apart; the internet, the lack of compensation for artist's, record stores and studios evaporating...everything he states makes sense and it's kinda frightening to think how much further we might fall.

Moving away from family, there have been many other women who have inspired, supported, and mentored me over the years. From each of these wonderful ladies I have learned many life lessons. They have been there with me as friends as I made the journey to recover my health. They have been there during times of personal and professional crisis. They continue to be here today taking my hand as we face the challenges of navigating life. The list of these ladies is so long that it would take more space than I can allocate for a readable blog. However, I have listed below some of the things that I have learned from them along the way. These are in no particular order just the most memorable.

4. Mathai (Team Adam) – “I’m Like A Bird” Mathai actually had a solid performance with this song. She felt mostly on key and used her vibrato to fit the quirky tone of the song. However, after a few more neat vocal runs her voice did a weird vocal shift that was both too high and too low and by the end Mathai was singing like Danny Elfman on a bad day. Also I wasn’t quite feeling her hamming it up in the stiff way she did. I saw Nelly Furtado live at the peak of that song’s popularity (summer 2001), and when she hammed it up she bounced around like an athlete. It was fun instead of awkward like Mathai’s stage presence.

The things that stood out for me in the content of the letter was that he indicated he'd gotten multiple letters and parcels from family members -- not something I would have expected for someone in a camp. I found his choice of words that their small daughter, who would stand as the "symbol" of their love, particularly tender and poignant. I wonder who Heinrich and Forenski were - they were clearly important enough to him to ask about. The letter had no envelope so I have no idea where it was sent to, that would have helped. I don't know the condition of the paper since it was scanned and sent to me as a PDF document.
Someone really needs to send the young pussycats on a course in constitutionalism.

‘’Mi ero consultato con l’Ufficio scolastico regionale – spiega il dirigente scolastico Renato Schettini, che già allora era alla guida del distretto comprendente, appunto, Carpignano e Briona – E mi era stato detto che non si poteva prendere alcun provvedimento, visto che la bidella non aveva avuto alcun tipo di interdizione o sospensione dai pubblici uffici. Autonomamente avevo però deciso di spostarla di sede: l’avevo trasferita a Briona, dove è rimasta fino all’altro giorno’’
I don’t get why that is wrong, irresponsible or evil. As a customer I want value for money. Cheap stuff stretches my pay packet all the farther and makes me a more prosperous individual. Unlike Dredgie I have no desire to work all week and piss all my money away in pubs. The lady squeeze is more than capable of pissing our hard earned money away on tat. I gather she considers shopping to be some sort of hobby instead of a necessary evil required in order not to starve. I like to divert a chunk into savings accounts and my nominee share account. I work to make myself rich, not others.
Have you ever had your Realtor pull a Clue Report for a property you are interested in buying? I do it for my buyers. Clue Reports are a great Real-Estate tool and will tell a potential buyer if they will have a ‘hard time getting home insurance for a home they are interested in. As Connecticut Insurance Services points out: “Its CARFAX for a home”. Often times Clue Reports contain more information than the Property Disclosure Forms. These reports go back 5 years and look at the history of claims on a prospective listings.’ If in doubt or if something does not look right after viewing or doing a building inspection have your Realtor request a Clue Report. It can provide you with more insight and potentially save a closing from coming to a screeching hold when you cannot secure home insurance. Per Connecticut Services: “All mortgage companies require that their customers purchase property insurance coverage on any structures secured by their mortgage. ” So why not find out right from the start if you as the potential buyer are going to have a difficult time securing said insurance.
“I declare that civil war is inevitable and is near at hand. When it comes the descendants of the heros of Lexington and Bunker Hill will be found equal in patriotism, courage and heroic endurance with the descendants of the heroes of Cowpens and Yorktown. For this reason I predict the civil war which is now at hand will be stubborn and of long duration.”
As I got older, gained beery friends from around the world and found out that London wasn't all bad I liked the idea of GBBF from the social and working point of views. The problem is I've had children of school age since 1993 and my younger child doesn't leave school until 2015. So the end of July/early August is reserved for family holidays so as not too much of the start of the football season. I'm off to the south of France tomorrow. I'll see you at GBBF in four years time.
Lead single Shuffle provides pretty much a microcosm of the album’s feel. Building a gentle, hooky pop song over a looping, dance-inducing piano sample, it’s, like all the best late-summer sounds, 75% exuberant and 25% melancholy. What You Want and Bad Timing waft in on similar breezes, but with less definition, more ambivalence. Lights Out, Words Gone is as close as they come to the realms of the epic, fostering a stabby white-funk riff until it blows off science (they’re warmer than Foals) and stumbles happily onto something not a million miles away from soul.
In the meantime, I’ll be busy as usual, and wishing it was the weekend…..3 days!
2007: “Read It Again”, Cambridgeshire Picture Book Award (shortlisted)
Marine spatial planning is an important topic right now. An executive order has highlighted the importance of planning how we will use our oceans and great lakes as a resource. This means a regions waters will be analyzed for current and anticipated uses such as wind farms, fishing, drilling etc. The country has been divided into 9 regional planning areas, with each region being responsible to create a coastal and marine spatial plan for their waters.

Add the grated zucchini, followed by the beans and peas - stir briefly and then add in the tomatoes - if using canned, crush them slightly and then add in enough water to just cover the beans. Let this simmer away until the beans have cooked through - depending on how fresh they are this could take 1 to 2 or more hours. If you find the mixture is too dry, just add a little more water.

This is the wrong approach to a dual problem: We have many foreclosed homes in New Jersey and we also have many people that for one reason or another can not afford a home. More foreclosed homes are coming down the pipe because the judicial moratorium on foreclosures has been lifted. As more homes are foreclosed, more people will become homeless.

The Notice of Intent, though, is a mini Complaint document (in Michigan the required parts of the Notice of Intent are copy/pasted from the requirements of the Complaint) that allows the Defendants an opportunity to testify that they were not to be included in any subsequent suits. It is the “not me” or the “I didn’t do it” chance. If they choose, the Defendant may respond with an Answer to the Notice of Intent stating that because of this or that that they are not to be a named party to the case. They also have the opportunity to request arbitration and try to settle the issue before a trial. In fact, the state intent of the Notice of Intent was to encourage arbitration. However, no one goes to arbitration because it is too easy for Defense to win at trial. So, defense typically ignores the Notice of Intent.

Thank you to the design team.. I am humbled and truly honored to have my name on the "Priscilla Award". I must say that this design team has been the most fun to play and create with and I am a better person having known each and everyone of them. It is with a heavy heart sharing that two of our wonderful MMDT “originals” will be stepping down to spend some much needed quality time with their families and persuing other avenues this summer. Michelle and Jeni, you will be missed, but I know you will only be a click away.
My instinct tells me that the colors are bit darker this time with less white. Not sure.
Thank you for teaching me about love, and life, and dreams that come true.
If it were for love, amoris causa, that Vermer converted, it was a particularly complex love, which combined love of the charitable indulgence of the Catholic God, love of the desirable Catherina Boles, and, just as profoundly, love for painting, which for the Catholic church was not surrounded by suspicion, which was on the contrary, invested with an exceptional and mysterious aura. Perhaps it was his own religion of painting that had also intimately led Vermeer to conversion.” (p.83)

The one thing that's always annoyed about Easter is the time. Why does it change? Why is it at the end of March one year then at the end of April the next? After seeing how late Easter fell this year I decided to find out why it jumps around like a hyperactive kid who's eaten too many chocolate eggs. It turns out that unlike every other holiday that has a set date based on our 365.25 day calendar, Easter is based on the lunar calendar.

"I know! I know!"
Damon breaks the news to Stefan and Elena: dark-side Alaric has gone rogue, and he suggests they take action and kill Alaric before he gets the chance to hurt Elena (vamp-sympathizer #1). Overhearing this, Jeremy storms out, followed by Elena, who promises him that nobody will be hurting Ric. This promise, paired with the fact that Alaric was now ringless made me think he was definitely going to be dead by the end of this season, if not by the end of this episode. Elena and Jeremy were interrupted when Esther showed up and demanded that Elena come with her, threatening Alaric’s safety. (Was anybody else a little bit confused as to why Elena didn’t even wait for Jeremy to return with Stefan and Damon before leaving with her?) It was only after she had gone that Stefan and Damon discovered a spell that trapped all vampires in the gym had been cast (there was boundary made of salt on the ground surrounding the school). This led Damon to interrupt Bonnie’s sexy time with her date (about time Bonnie got some real action), calling her for witch duty.

The Freud dynasty is at the heart of this compelling social history. Sigmund Freud, founder of psychoanalysis; Edward Bernays, who invented public relations; Anna Freud, Sigmund’s devoted daughter; and present-day PR guru and Sigmund’s great grandson, Matthew Freud. Sigmund Freud’s work into the bubbling and murky world of the subconscious changed the world. By introducing a technique to probe the unconscious mind, Freud provided useful tools for understanding the secret desires of the masses. Unwittingly, his work served as the precursor to a world full of political spin doctors, marketing moguls, and society’s belief that the pursuit of satisfaction and happiness is man’s ultimate goal.

PS: If you want my advice and are thinking about having a reading I suggest an Angel Reading. I've had readings done by Claire, Tiffany (the Reiki Master whom I'm getting my certification from), Balen (that was a quickie but, I'm looking into something more) and Christine. All of which were incredibly insightful. I'll also mention that I've never been in the same room with a single one of them but, a few of them I feel quite close to. Also, if you're on fb and you "like" their group...the 3333rd person wins a free reading. When I looked earlier tonight it was at 3320 so, hurry on over!

Our pictures could be a little better, it was a dark dreary day today and even with the flash, they were a little dark. I tried lightening them in Photo Shop but only had limited luck. Our main paint color is Ralph Lauren Canvas Natural VM15. I was going to link back to the color swatch online but it looked a little fleshy to me. It is such a GREAT color and seems to just play off of any other color that you put with it. I used an egg shell finish to that the walls would be easy to keep clean for the new owner.

All of Lockdown is set in Furnace; but a handful of flashbacks tells us how Alex got himself in this situation, a life sentence in Furnace. A prison just for teenagers -- well, some only boys, younger than teenagers -- who society decided are too scary, too dangerous, too bad to be free. Instead, they are sent to Furnace, with no promise of parole, no hope of escape. Death is the only way out.

On Sunday, the CSUSB men’s basketball team took on the legendary UCLA Bruins at Citizens Business Bank Arena. It was a David vs. Goliath situation. The CSUSB team is good, but it is a Division II school while UCLA is not only a Division I school but one of the most, if not the most, prestigious college basketball program in the entire country.
Both fpdc and bpdc can add more texture to your crochet project. These stitches are worked like the regular double crochet except for the fact that you insert the hook in a different way before you pull up a loop. Fpdc is easier to work than a regular double crochet. In fpdc, you insert the hook from front. In bpdc you insert the hook from back. When doing bpdc just fold and hold the work to keep it out of the way when you complete the stitch. Below is a step by step pictorial illustration of the two.

The Belgian Saison that I brewed last Sunday is still chugging-away in it's primary fermenter. It will need at least another 4 - 6 days there, before being transferred to the secondary. The American Brown that I brewed a month ago is delicious. It turned out to be a wonderful "session" beer. The Belgian Strong Dark Ale needs to be transferred to kegs and carbonated. I'll do that this weekend. The Oak-Aged Imperial Stout also needs to be transferred and carbonated. With the IPA and Imperial IPA, that will make for 5 decent beers on tap, (six, if I include my barleywine downstairs).

Brooklyn's main jail opened up on Saturday, offering walking tours to the community.
Published over two decades years after the release of Le Corbeau, Shirley Jackon’s terrific short story The Possibility of Evil appears to have been inspired by Clouzot’s film. Both are built around the same premise, an anonymous citizen is writing poisonous letters attacking the townspeople’s misdeeds, in the hope that it will lead them to correct the error of the ways. Instead, in both story and film it creates a climate of paranoia and dis-ease that spreads like a virus, infecting everyone in it path. At first, the townspeople try to ferret out the epistle-writer, but soon grow frustrated with that, and instead turn their paranoid concerns to the most prominent victim of these insidious attacks, Dr. Germain. Complicating our reaction to these events, as the persistent victim of many of these smears, Germain is not a particularly appealing hero. He is cool and aloof, detached and even a little arrogant. And the charges made against him may have merit: Germain just might be guilty. And we just might cheer his fall.
We make exceptions for genius with the benefit of hindsight. With the weight of a century or so of bolstering critical opinion, we all now recognise that William Blake was a genius, and so we suspend our disbelief about his visions. Who knows what a genius may or may not see? Perhaps we consider that, as an artist as well as a poet, Blake’s visual imagination produced images so vivid, so concrete, that in some way they did indeed ‘appear’ before him. Perhaps, as Peter Ackroyd suggests early in his book, the faculty of eidetic imagery, fairly common in children who see hallucinatory images as genuine sensory perceptions, was retained by Blake throughout his life.

FINALLY.... Jake's ring! He chose to have a thumb ring because of comfort and because it's a reference to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. He works with his hands/fingers on a daily basis and isn't used to wearing jewelry. I think a thumb ring looks cooler and is an awesome compromise since I didn't think I could talk him into a ring in the first place.

According to the authors, homosexuality found in the Nazi Party contributed to the extreme militarism of Nazi Germany. The title of the book, as well as the book itself, is a reference to a book by Richard Plant called The Pink Triangle: The Nazi War Against Homosexuals, a book detailing homophobia in the Nazi Party and the homosexual victims of Nazism. – Wikipedia

If you're like me, you get fairly invested in blogs...more specifically, a blogger's home and life. (Megan said it quite nice in this post about how home bloggers are opening their homes, and therefore, their hearts.) So if my blogger friend (because if I'm reading that blog regularly, I consider them a friend) posts about a project, I think about it in my regular life. And if they don't go back to the project for awhile, I wonder how it's coming along.
TCC enables teachers to communicate with students and parents in a classroom-like setting with confidence that the classroom activities are restricted from the general public. Teachers have access to create new classes, invite students and parents, and act as the owner and administrator for their newly created classrooms. Student accounts can find their list of classes, participate in classroom activities and discussions, upload assignments, review shared content, class requirements and calendars, access learning-trees (created by teachers or fellow peers), view photos and videos. Parents can be invited into the classroom by the teacher that owns the class. Parent accounts can view any information that is made public to them via classroom sharing. Parents can also access class calendars and events, and assist in their child’s education process.
Clary and Jace are having relationship problems as Jace struggles through his worries about his biological father and the father thatraised him, Valentine. Simon has girl troubles and he struggles to choose from two girls, while worrying about coming out to his parents. Simon also realizes that being a Daylighter will change his lifestyle, and how dangerous it is for him to be alone, as there are many dark forces fighting for him to be at their side. Although Jace killed Sebastian in the third book, they have never found the body. Who has taken Sebastian, and why?
Rash claims about multilingualism simply perpetuate the myth that multilinguals are special in some way or other. Saying that “special” nowadays means ‘beneficial’ instead of ‘detrimental’ in turn persuades multilinguals of their entitlement to the same kind of smugness that monolinguals flaunted about in older times. Feuds, whether drawing on what my great-great-grandmother did to your not so great ancestor, or on the number of languages that we happen to need to use, are pointless and never-ending. The see-saw of opinions about multilingualism is clear evidence of this.
When I saw this post on I Am Baker's hydrangea cake, I immediately wanted to make it, except in cupcake form! With Mother's Day coming up, as well as Teacher Appreciation Week at Matthew's preschool (I had signed up to make a dessert for the luncheon), it was the perfect opportunity to make them.

It’s likely you feel compelled to function with strength and compassion. You’re a sympathetic and kind person, generous with personal and material resources. Wisdom, balance, and understanding are the cornerstones of your life—they define your overall approach to life in general. Your extraordinary wisdom and the ability to understand other people’s problems starts at an early age. This allows you to easily span the generation gap and assume an important role in life early on.

I digress. I love our house, I don't love doing the work that we need to get it where we want it to be. Before we bought our house, we were going back and forth between the one we purchased and another townhouse that was single level, a little run-down, and a short sale. It had a gorgeous patio and an extra outdoor area for the dogs to pee and run around in. It only had one and a half bathrooms, which was a big negative. We ended up choosing the house we have for the amount of bathrooms, the fact that it was a little more taken care of, just for... everything overall.

The High is a fine example of his earlier work, but for me, Meier’s crowning achievement is The Getty in L.A. That campus of structures is as thoughtful a manipulation of space, solid / void, differing texture as I have seen. Path. Space. View. Vista. Adjacency. He identified and exaggerated the hilltop site’s inherent character and took full advantage of its every nuance. His choice and distribution of materials, the sequence of moves and their inter-relationship are so subtle that this relatively new facility convinces you that it has always lived there – so deliberate that it feels naturally occurring. The Getty seems somehow historic, monumental but at the same time perfectly understated. It’s stunning really and makes me feel like an absolute hack. As a brash, not so young, know-it-all architecture student I spent a flawless, solitary afternoon on the grounds of the Getty and was forced to confront the agonizing truth that I really didn’t know a damn thing about experiential space. I’ve attempted (in futility) to replicate

We should trust in Christ. We should also believe that Jesus is the son of God and that He is our savior. We should help others to believe in Christ too so that they can have eternal life. Jesus came down from heaven and died for our sins and if we trust in Him then we will become sons and daughters of God. We should trust in Jesus and we should help others to trust in Him. If we are like John and we testify about Christ then we can help others to be believers, John testified about Jesus and we should too.

The ad was shot in the Hornsey Tavern, north London, and the music is by a precocious eighteen year-old called Jake Bugg, who is to my ears like Ed Sheeran, only good. The gaffer is an actor, but many of the people are real punters, sharing real beer moments. The finished ad has been culled from about five hours of footage, the film crew just passing through the pub as people relaxed and shared a good time having a beer. It's the kind of positive image of beer and pubs the whole industry sorely needs more of.

The Sustainable Earth line is the apparent successor to Staples' "bagasse" sugar-cane based paper, which has lots of rave reviews on the Fountain Pen Network. Many people were lamenting that Staples was no longer carrying the the bagasse looseleaf, so others were pointing out that the paper was available in notebooks under the new "Sustainable Earth" name. With everybody clamoring for it so much, I had to pick up a notebook to try it out. (See the end of this post for giveaway details.)
Carmen, meaning song in latin, couldn’t be a more fitting name for chanteuse Carmen Olivia. A true lover of soul, hip-hop, and jazz—Carmen’s voice has been molded by greats such as Karen Carpenter, Luther Vandross, Sade, and Whitney Houston since the tender age of nine. Her passion and talent lead her to perform in community musicals, weddings, and events.

How is the business coach to avoid the confusion? If you suspect your client has psychopathic tendencies, look for other signals. To separate the narcissist from the psychopath, one must go further into the traits and characteristics that they do not share. Of the 20 psychopathic traits and characteristics of the psychopath, those that can be gleaned in the context of a normal coaching session include:
I'm still on the hunt for a vanity (I have a mirror and a lamp, I need a smallish table with a nice sized drawer, I'm hoping to thrift it) and a chair. I also still need a rug. But I'm getting there.

Creatively, there are several scrapbook celebs that inspire me ~ Tim Holtz, Maggie Holmes, Jennifer McGuire, Wendy Morris to name a few. I think my favorite is Elizabeth Kartchner, A.K.A. Dear Lizzy. That girl manages to design for American Crafts, post on her blog almost daily, jet set off to various trade shows, & scrapbook ALL while having a family with three beautiful little girls. She said in an article that sometimes she'll scrapbook for just 10 minutes if she can. I laughed and was like, "Hey! Me too!" Crazy? Maybe, but I'm good with it.
As shown by a 1999 study by Martha Olney, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, the Great Depression of the 1930s offers vivid evidence that borrowers default for strategic reasons, and make full payments even on loans that appear “unaffordable” when given the incentive to do so. (Thanks to Song Han at the Federal Reserve Board for pointing me to this study).

I think the really important thing at this point is to PIN THOSE SUCKERS DOWN. Otherwise tiny details can sometimes slither away from you and it's really hard to get them back. What's more, the very act of writing down your ideas makes them feel more concrete and get-at-able.

I started with 1-1/2 cups of raw quinoa which was cooked in three cups of low-sodium broth. Several chopped carrots, a few ribs of chopped celery, many sliced mushrooms, and a large chopped onion were stir-fried until nearly cooked, then pulsed in the food processor until they were finely chopped but NOT puréed. The vegetables were mixed into the quinoa along with 1/2 cup of shelled, roasted but unsalted pistachios, about 1/2 cup of chopped kalamata olives, salt and pepper. This should be enough for six large peppers.

A good licensee will listen to what his/her regulars want and will not be motivated solely by profit. Speaking from my own experience (running an off-licence for five years that specialised in draught ales to take away), I tried to strike a balance by stocking what the majority of my customers wanted (one would be stupid NOT to do this), but also offering a couple of regularly changing guest ales.The two most popular beers, ie. the one's requested the most, were Harveys and Larkins. I therefore alternated between these two as my regular beers. They were complemented by a couple of guest ales, which would be on sale at the weekends when demand was at its peak. I would then gradually run stocks down over the course of the coming week, before repeating the cycle all over again. I also made a point of stocking seasonal ales, in particular old ales and porters in winter (sometimes from Harveys and Larkins), refreshing golden ales in summer and other interesting beers when they were available.

There are many reasons that you might need formal wear at some time in your life, and it is important that you feel comfortable and stylish when you put your dress on. Shopping in a store can be discouraging because there is often a limited selection, as well as the chance that someone else in your area already owns the same dress. When you must make do with the dresses on the rack, you also run the risk of choosing the only dress that fits you well, which severely limits the styles and colors that you can choose. By broadening your search, you could find a much wider range of dresses from which to choose.

The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire from which these lines are excerpted took Gibbon 12 years to complete, beginning in 1776. The “conservative” voting into office any churchgoing moron who has good orthodontics framed in engaging smiles, is over 5’10” and married with children and not fornicating, will be outraged by the salvos Gibbon fired at Christianity in this multi-volume masterpiece. He would be only slightly less outraged by Gibbon’s dislike of Judaism and his wondering in horror what would have happened if Mussulmans won the battle of Poitiers and the Koran would now be taught by Oxford professors demonstrating to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.

The horse is named after the Russian geographer and explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky; hence its unusual name. However, the Mongolians call it the Takhi. The Takhi disappeared from its home range in the Mongolian Steppes in the 1960′s but since 1998 an international effort has successfully introduced takhi taken from zoo populations and reintroduced them into three Mongolian protected areas. This is a rare example of a successful reintroduction of a species into the wild and the Mongolians are rightly proud of this.

Though each separate statement can be a study all on their own, this figure of speech emphasizes the unique identity of the fusion or synthesis, like an orchestra. An orchestra has a brass section, a winds section, percussion instruments and together they are a beautiful musical arrangement. The sound of the whole is unlike each individual instrument, playing alone, and should be respected as a different composition entirely. Here for you mouth-watering, ear-tantalizing enjoyment is:
This is remarkable. Someone in Europe who is focusing on the growth of government spending. He doesn’t mention that the solution is a spending cap (something akin to Mitchell’s Golden Rule), but that’s an implication of what he says. Moreover, I’m just glad that someone recognizes that the problem is spending, and that debt and deficits are best understood as symptoms of that underlying disease.

These are the completed gift sets for the Girl Scouts. I had so much fun making these for the girls. Molly passed them out on Tuesday and the girls loved them.

This is not empty rhetoric. Both the MK veterans and the South African public are aware of the role that the veterans played in rendering the country 'ungovernable' during the apartheid era. If the word 'ungovernable' comes in shades of grey, then the veterans have done very little to distinguish between their version of 'ungovernable' and that advocated by Oliver Tambo at the height of the fight against the apartheid government.

This project was another "prize" I made for our first ever Cookie Exchange party! This prize was super easy to make and turned out great! Last Summer a good friend of mine gave me several boxes of 12 x 12 tile that she no longer needed. Some of the tiles in the box was broken but I didn't want to just throw them out. I found a tile that was broken perfectly so that instead of it being 12 x 12, the tile was now about 9 x 12.

Joey: I’ve been to The Garage many, many times to drink beers with the roaches out on their patio. This time I went to enjoy lunch with the slightly better company of the BLC. I was surprised and pleased to find easy street parking directly in front of the restaurant. But like most restaurants we’ve visited, The Garage was fairly crowded at noon on a Friday. We snagged some menus at the bar and nestled into a seat underneath a hanging motorcycle. The menu was limited to a build your sandwich option and the soup of the day. The prices were not listed but I didn’t feel this was a “if you have to ask…” type situation. I ordered a cup of taco soup and half a BLT from the bar that could have possibly cost me a ton of cash but turned out to be quite reasonable. As I am currently not working on Fridays, I looked forward to the opportunity to order the first ever beer at a Birmingham Lunch Club meeting. I really felt this order would make me the Jackie Robinson of the BLC. Unfortunately, soon after I sat back down with my Shiner Bock I noticed that the hiring manager for a position I had applied for was sitting at the bar enjoying his lunch. But at least when I don’t get that job I can blame it on my Shiner Bock instead of my own job skills. The BLT was better than the soup and the beer was better than both. The Garage would be an OK place to meet a friend downtown for lunch for the same reason I like to meet friends there for drinks. It’s quiet and allows for a relaxed conversation. The sandwiches weren’t that great, but they were fine as an accompaniment to a conversation with friends.

"Collateral Damage". Such a sad, unkind, non-feeling term that trivializes the lives of one, tens, hundreds, or thousands of people. Donald Rumsfeld felt comfortable coining the civilian lives lost during this Iraqi conflict in the name of spreading "freedom" and "democracy" collateral damage. Research has revealed that during all conflicts between WWII and today, 90% of the casualties have been civilians, in addition to the countless injured that will never be recorded, and lost to the inattentiveness of history. If these civilians are collateral damage, then what is the real goal of this conflict? The phony assertion regarding WMD's that it turns out were nowhere to be found - and were never there - could no longer hold water. So George W Bush decided to reinvent his focus as being on the outing of the despotic regime of Saddam Hussein, and all of the death, poverty, and inhumanity he was raining on his people. While it's true that Saddam Hussein's ruling style was a far cry from the Noblesse Oblige of France in the 19th century, it turns out the war from democracy in Iraq is against the people instead of on their behalf. It's a sad state of affairs when a population that supposedly "welcomed us as liberators", and was to be a bastion of democracy in the "evil" Muslim Middle East, must pay for the sins of their ousted leader with the lives of 650,000. On a side note, it is interesting to recognize the correlations between present-day United States and Germany under the Third Reich. Both regimes use fear as their motivational tool to create nationalism and revolutionary apathy. Also borne of this fear is the retraction of individual rights and freedoms in the name of necessity and national security. Another characterization of Nazi Germany that the United States espouses is the idea that we are "right" and that those against us are "wrong"; and we will triumph in the end because of this fact. Much of the world - especially the Islamic world - views the present-day United States in much the same way as the world views Nazi Germany; imperialistic, nationalistic, close-minded, and hungry to expand their empire in an attempt at global domination. Although the means are quite different - the United States using clandestine methods while Germany used genocide and open conquest - the ends are eerily similar.

O how gladly would Christ receive me at the Last Judgment, if when summoned to the spiritual office, to preach and care for souls, I had left it and busied myself with fighting and with the temporal sword! And how should Christ come to it that He or His have anything to do with the sword and go to war, and kill men’s bodies, when He glories in it that He has come to save the world, not to kill people? For His work is to deal with the Gospel and by His Spirit to redeem men from sin and death, nay, to help them from this world to everlasting life. According to John 6:15, He fled and would not let Himself be made king; before Pilate He confessed, “My kingdom is not of this world”; and He bade Peter, in the garden, put up his sword, and said, “He that taketh the sword shall perish by the sword.”
Everything is gestation and bringing forth. To let each impression and each germ of a feeling come to completion wholly in itself, in the dark, in the inexpressible, the unconscious, beyond the reach of one’s own intelligence, and await with deep humility and patience the birth-hour of a new clarity: that alone is living in the artist’s life. –Rainer Maria Rilke

More evidence that technology has reduced the number of good jobs can be found in a working paper by David Autor, an economist at MIT, and David Dorn, an economist at the Center for Monetary and Financial Studies in Madrid. They too point to the crucial years of 2000–2005. Job growth happened mainly at the ends of the spectrum: in lower-paying positions, in areas such as personal care, cleaning services, and security, and in higher-end professional positions for technicians, managers, and the like. For laborers, administrative assistants, production workers, and sales representatives, the job market didn’t grow as fast—or even shrank. Subsequent research showed that things got worse after 2007. During the recession, nearly all the nation’s job losses were in those middle categories—the positions easiest to replace, fully or in part, by technology.

I was the one feeding our two dogs and five cats. I was the one doing the laundry of three adults weekly. I was the one cleaning our one room trailer that we all lived in.
That is the crux of it. Feeling validated and listened to by our fellow Mother friends.

As, the Telegraph report, above, details, they are not the only ones. Amnesty International have also detailed extensive torture by the new regime, particularly of Sub-Saharan and Black Africans.

…I saw, as I had foreseen would happen, that his gaze was riveted on the upper slopes of my mouth.

The premise is basically King George the 5th is old and sick. He dies, and the kingship goes to his oldest son. However, his oldest son is a philanderer (or at least, is interested in one) and kings are unable to marry someone who has been divorced. That being said, the crown is then passed to the younger son, who happens to have a severe speech impediment. The time frame is that of WW2, and thus, it is extremely important that Europe has a leader that can you.... speak. So he proceeds to get a speech coach, and that's where the movie takes off, and doesn't let up. Before you complain about spoilers, all that information is given to you upfront anyways, but the movie is basically about the relationship between the two, and the growth of an unappreciated man .

Get the full background on the Austin City Council Open Government Scandal when the Jennifer Peebles at the Texas Watchdog interviews Ken Martin at the Austin Bulldog in a TW podcast. That's a lot of dog on dog action. Interesting stuff; Martin dishes a lot of juicy details about who concealed what and how the story was broken. They've stopped the illegal meetings, says Martin, but the City is still concealing emails where City Councilmembers performed city business on their personal email accounts, a clear violation of years of precedent from the Texas Attorney General. Which is probably why, also in violation of the law, the City of Austin did not request an opinion from the Attorney General. They just said "no," like Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener declaring, "I would prefer not to." With no other recourse, Martin has been forced into court for the documents. Honestly, County Attorney David Escamilla is the only one who can crack this nut by bringing charges against those politicians who by all appearances conspired to violate the open records and open meetings acts.

The action in The Dragon Waiting revolves around several characters in these locales. From the exiled pretender to the Byzantine throne, Dimitrios Ducas, to the Welsh magician Hywel to the Florentine medic Cynthia Ricci to a German artilleryman, Gregory, who is afflicted with porphyria, the novel begins with leisurely examinations of life in quasi-15th century Europe. We see how the addition of magic, as wielded by Hywel and others, has influenced the course of events in the British isles. We also encounter much that is very familiar to those readers who are familiar with late medieval European social and political history: the reign of the Medicis in Florence, the machinations of the Sforza in Milan during the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the squabbling of the proto-mercantilist German states organized in an analogue of the Hanseatic League, as well as references to the Wallachian Vlad the Impaler and other nefarious figures. These real historical characters, existing now in an alternate reality, serve to ground the narrative to an extent, but they also underscore some of the weaknesses inherent in having an alt-history include so many connections to our shared reality.

It applied like butter and dried very fast, which is always a plus with metallic polishes.
