Last but not the least, when a film does well or a cricketer scores a century, there is a competition amongst celebrities to be the first to congratulate the achiever on twitter. This leads to farcical situations as the congratulatory message lacks conviction and sounds half-baked. But everything is momentary on twitter including the attention span of the followers. What is a trending topic today will be a long forgotten topic the next day. This is what makes twitter so addictive for when you are addicted to something, you tend to ignore all the side effects at your own peril.

I enjoy literature about Arthur and Merlin and Guinevere, so I have been enjoying this show about young Arthur and Merlin. It’s sort of like Smallville in a way, but better. We watch as King Uther tries to abolish sorcery and witchcraft from Camelot; we hear references to Avalon and meet Mordred; we get to see how Excalibur was forged and why Merlin had to get rid of it. If you’re a fan of the mythology then there is plenty to keep you watching.
When I go in for the C section they will check her position again, and I'm not sure what they'd do if she turned -- send me home probably? As welcome as this news would be, it would throw us for a whole other mental/emotional/logistical loop, so I am not sure what to hope for! Anyway, for now the plan is for me to work this week and next and then stop at 38 weeks to have some time at home before the surgery. I'll keep you posted!
Were expectations set too high? I went into Cabin in the Woods without knowing anything about it, and I was impressed on every level. The Dark Knight was one of the most anticipated movies of 2008, but it still blew us away. If it’s a good movie, hype shouldn’t have anything to do with it.
One week until my due date. Baby is engaged and I'm uncomfortable. I hope he turns up on time.

Third, I fear moving out of this constant struggle will give me freedom to wander. I pray He binds my heart to Himself so I will stay close. Prosperity is a big test and harder than being in great need. I see my desperation and know my great need. I never want to forget that.
Even Invisible Children was founded based on this disgusting complex. 3 students who went to Sudan not because they heard of Kony and wished to fight his terror, but to FIND something tragic to film a video on. Yucks.
Even in very open, accepting groups of people, it’s still possible to feel “weird” for being the only gay one. You’re the punchline of numerous jokes. You’re “that gay friend” that everybody thinks they can come to for advice about “gay stuff”. You’re expected to educate everybody about queerness. You’re singled out way too often, all because you’re gay.
I suppose I should make a formal announcement here at the "old" blog before I have all operations going at the new place.
There was a little bit of rawness on the very top of his leg, but by the evening this had now scabbed up. So far, it is looking nice and clean and I noticed that the swelling has gone down. If you look at the previous pictures and compare it with the one below, you can see the difference.
Sometimes I get sick and tired of my Thankless Job. I told the kids this morning that I am going On Strike. They didn't care, they know I won't. See, Paul and I left for the band concert last evening after dinner...we left with some of the little ones. A few of the girls were at Susan's, but lots of kids were here. Long story short, when we got home, the dinner was still out. I was not thrilled to see that, it was 8 o'clock, and time to wind down, not wash up. blah. I put some of it away, but I think there are some kids here who need to wash those pans and dishes. I do not want to start a Third World War, but I am going to put my foot down. One nice teenager said to me this morning, "Sorry about the mess, Mom." I told her not to worry about it, it will be waiting for her when she gets home. I hate being like that, but sometimes it is necessary.

Well my little boy you have been very busy this week, you are now officially crawling everywhere!! You’ve been doing 1 or 2 little steps forward for just over a week, and then yesterday it just sort of came out of nowhere and you were following me all over the place, into the kitchen, up and down the hallway, great fun! And the same again today, there’s no stopping you now. It’s so weird seeing you move about by yourself, I can’t believe how quickly you’ve picked it up. You still really like walking on your feet with me holding your hands, you go so quickly now it’s hard to keep up! You want to walk most of the time, it’s killing my back!! Just kidding… Don’t think it’ll be too long now until you’re off running. Oh dear! Need to get stair gates now ASAP now you’re on the go. The fun starts now, no leaving you in a room any more and knowing where I left you, now I hear the pitter patter of your hands and feet as you come chasing after, it’s so lovely. When you’re trying to crawl somewhere I have been getting on the floor, banging it loud and telling you I’m coming to get you, you laugh so much and try to get away but you get so over excited you forget what to do and just flap on the floor and hide your face laughing, too funny!

The Nightmare Card by Catherine Johnson freaked me out. The story is told retrospectively by Mina. We learn that her best mate Sara found a pack of tarot cards and decided it would be fun to mess around with them and tell fake fortunes to friends at school. It starts off innocently enough, but soon we sense a change in Sara. She behaves strangely and distances herself from Mina. Her appearance changes and it looks like she doesn't sleep at all. The story is short, sharp, frightening. Nothing is actually explained in so many words, but by using the images in the cards, the author shows us what's happened to Sara and it's not at all pleasant.
Planning, only today I understood that there are people who don’t like planning , I wonder how I assumed that everyone would love planning like the strange creature inside me. The real trouble is when these opposing perspectives come to work together. That will indeed be a big challenge.
I've been thinking about how much I like styling and photographing little odds and ends...cupcake wrappers, buttons, flowers, fabric...you know what I'm taking about, right? Anyway, I think I'm going to do more of that...mini color collections of little tidbits. Sort of the way this post is. I think it will help me to be more creative. I've been wanting to get back to the part of me that's more artistic rather than crafty.

11. Exercise Increases "Mental Fitness" A brisk walk's a simple exercise, yet it's especially good for the brain, since it increases the amount of oxygen and glucose reaching the brain. People who take brisk walks daily, show significant improvement in memory, improve learning ability, concentration and abstract reasoning.
Whether Picasso said it in the same vein is debatable. But Jobs’ interpretation makes great business sense: for some fleeting moments in August, Apple’s gadgets were worth more than Exxon’s oil. Last checked, the company was valued at $350 billion.
Be in awe. Be in the moment of the wonder. And in the moment allow God to find you and know you. Be known. Be loved and love toward all.
I realized for as long as I kept my struggle to myself, no one was the better for it. I was miserable, and other moms like me thought they were alone, too. But when I started talking, that is - when I got real, and honest, and gave vulnerability a chance - it was as if a whole new world opened up. Not only was I set free to be real, but so were the women with whom I spoke. And we have developed a bond, a community of support and understanding. I love it!

I went upstairs to reset the cable box with Chase in tow. I didn't realize that the cord from telephone that sits next to the box got stuck between my toes and my sandal. As I turned to leave, the cord snagged my foot and I tried to stick out my other foot to gain my balance and avoid falling on my ass. No such luck. Chase was right behind me and, to avoid falling on her, I ended up contorting in such a manner that I literally bent the toes on the unstuck foot back toward my knee, and then I fell on my butt.
I went to my second class with Osvaldo and Coca Cartery, Tango Lesson with Osvaldo and Coca. I like their teaching style, first you dance for a while to get warmed up and then they show you a very simple step to work on. This week they showed us a 5 quick beat forward collect back collect move. For the leader it goes like this: Right foot forward outside partner, Left foot forward collecting, Right foot back, Left foot back collect, Right foot forward outside partner again. This move is more frequently seen danced to milonga music, but it works quite nicely with Tangos also.
I didn't press the lock on the remote or inside the car. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? I am locked out of my rental car with it running in my driveway.
I have pictures in my camera, but the connecting cord to the computer is MIA. Hopefully soon it’ll be found. Like my wallet–I went to get it out at church–another really good thing, I not only went to church, I walked in! Anyway, I couldn’t find my wallet at the end of the service. I came home, hubs checked the car, I checked where I remembered it had been last here, nope. So I called church and the youth pastor answered and looked for it, unsuccessfully. But hubs, love this guy, took sonny bowling and went by the church, which was open for some kind of event. He went in and found my wallet in the chair I sat in; it was between the cushion and the side of the chair. And we thought we had the only recliners that eat objects dropped in them. Relief!

Outside, there were large bird cages, and bee and butterfly gardens which my 3 year old enjoyed immensely. There are also a variety of different nature paths that are open for hiking. The paths were well shaded and we were able to enjoy a scenic walk through the forest. You can call in advance or check the website in advance to find out when the nature center runs their special events. This place is best for children ages 3-7 years of age and will probably provide 1-3 hours of entertainment.
Gross violation of human rights and mass manslaughter in Azerbaijan caused little reaction of Western powers. Mikhail Gorbachev’s regime was adamantly supported against “heavily armed gangs of hooligans and drug-traffickers.”
I have written before about working on improving birth weight values. My goal is a spread of birth weights between seven and eleven pounds. Different people have different ideals, based on their management systems. I want my lambs to have big enough frames that they are not at risk of chilling on cold, rainy days; but not so big that they risk difficult births, because I’m not always present to assist. It looks like I’ve made some progress there, here are my numbers from this year.

Lights reflected off the fountain and puddles as we walked around, gazing through windows at ceilings covered with frescos. With damp fingers we held hands, strolling through the night wondering what life was like hundreds of years ago when the ornately decorated walls protected kings and queens.
Formerly known as The History Channel, it is the most informative in giving an overall look at the past, present, and future. The American-based international satellite and cable TV channel broadcasts a variety of reality shows and documentary programs including those of fictional and non-fictional historical content, together with speculation about the future. (Wikipedia) Like everything else you watch or read today, you have to sift through but some shows are timely and right on target. The channel’s extensive coverage of the Rise and fall of the Third Reich gives insight into the workings of the two rivals in the spirit realm. What was taking place in the spirit realm during that era of history? Enmeduraki leading Germany against Satan’s United States and Satan undermining Enmeduranki to inspire Hitler to kill the Jews and at the same time was leading his own prized child to victory against Enmeduranki with his allies.

The Garmin buzzed at 1 mile, buzzed at 2 miles, buzzed at 3 miles. I ran on. Five was the goal. I went up hills, down hills, met up with a few long straights. It was awesome. I’ve been running in my town for so long that I usually know the distance of specific routes. If I’m going to run 5, I go this way, if I’m running 8, I go that way. This morning I wanted to change it up a little and incorporate a new neighborhood that I had run through the day before with my bad attitude. I was hopeful since I was having a better run I would enjoy it more.

Julianna Barwick's 2011 album The Magic Place was one of my favourite releases of the year so I had high hopes for the gig, and wasn't disappointed. Since it is mostly just Julianna's vocals, it was not a loud performance, and you can clearly hear clinking glasses and coughs. But it was a (kinda disappointingly) small and quiet audience and the recording turned out well.

Beltane, I fell asleep on the couch and first dreamed of him. That first one was very simple, just him on the swing. Every dream since then has added more of the scenery or new characters, and feelings. Lots of feelings. Mostly just happiness, but any of the emotions I feel are amplified somehow.
That's what I am, what I've always been, and what I will be until I die. I love stories. I love books. I love crafting imaginary worlds and living within them, I love bringing characters to life and laughing and crying with them. I love words. I love the spaces between words. I love commas and semicolons and fullstops and even the occasional exclamation mark. Exposition, description, dialogue, action; I adore them. And NOTHING and NO ONE can ever take that love, that passion, away from me...except me.

So My day consisted of pretty much nothing except doctors offices yesterday. What an annoying process! Through the course of some changes this past year, our little family has been blessed with double coverage insurance for a few months. WOO-HOO, right! I was totally pumped about this in the beginning, even jokingly wishing that something big but minor and non life threatening would happen to myself of the husband.(spare the kids right?) I wanted to use this double insurance, I imagined in my mind how incredibly satisfying it would be to not only whip out 2 insurance cards at the receptionist desk but to see that infamous doctor bill come back with the words printed at the bottom...You owe this amount...$0.00!!! I jokingly said these things for the first week we had this glorious double coverage... that is until I got a phone call from my husband late one evening after out practicing for his upcoming snowmachine, or snowmobile race for all of you in the rest of the world. We call it a snowmachine up here in the great north, and no I don't mean it makes snow!!! Anyways he called me and said that he had good news and he had bad news....UH_OH. The good news was he was still alive and the bad news was that he thought he may have broken his back!!!! Yeah...joking OVER! I said I wanted minor...non life threatening!!! Funny thing as we were hobbling him into the ER he looked at me and said..."this is your fault". I said" WHAT! How is this my fault!" He replied with a smile on his face," you are the one who wanted to use this double coverage insurance!" HAHA.... quite the jokester. A few hours later, a lot of tests, and a hefty bill that I didn't have to pay any of I might add... He was released with a clean bill of health, just major bumps and bruises and maybe a cracked rib or two, no broken back...THANK YOU LORD! Ok, Ok ... back to why I was in the doctor all day yesterday... being the thrifty bargain mommy that I am, our double coverage ends the end of the month and being the horrible procrastinator I am I waited until now to get all dentist, doctor and whatever else I could think to squish into this last month! Frustrating though because you never walk out of the doctor office being done, we are always referred to another specialist or need another X-ray or something. It seems to be just an on-going process. GRRRR.... I guess it's ok with me as long as we get it all done by the end of the month, and the bottom of the page says, You owe this amount...$0.00!!! HAHA!
I wake this morning to the shock news that Peter, or 'Sleazy' to his many friends, has died in his sleep, at his home in Bangkok. I'm stunned. He visited us just a few weeks ago. Ossian and I can hardly believe it. At 55, Sleazy's appetite for life was immense, and brooked no argument! I suppose it makes sense there was to be no gradual slide to a halt. A sudden end, an extraordinarily full life.

...or maybe longer. We've had a lovely little crisis come up. Remember my post about the week from you-know-where last week? Turns out things could get worse. I'm not at liberty to say because of this being a public blog, but my posting will probably be a bit sporadic for the next 30 days. I'm just being honest-I am reeling right now. We could really use prayer, and I hope I haven't worn out my welcome asking for it. If you know us in real life, you know what to pray for, and if you don't, please pray that God shows us what to do and for a miracle for the Rice Ranch.

A truely stupid display of who they think is important considering it is based on and tallied from missing truckloads of uncounted votes. The Elementary School children of Iowa could have been more professional, but they don't have a hidden agenda to ignore and make sure the only candidate U.S. Solders and Americans at home respect isn't acknowledged, is too radical and can't win...because the Republican Party rigged the election rules at the last minute before voting, because for the first time in Iowa they decide to move the ballots around in a giant shell game, because the Republican Party and their multimillionaire lying dishonest party favorites can hardly wait to get into office and change nothing.

Some people think it took so long for them to recognize Jesus, because they had not yet heard of his resurrection. The disciples of Jesus were in a place of sadness and loss. In sad times, it can be hard to see the good things that surround us. Perhaps, after walking with Jesus for a distance, sharing stories of his life and memories together and then sitting down for a meal; allowed the disciples to begin to see some good. In that moment of Jesus breaking bread all their senses communicated the good news that Jesus was with them. Their eyes saw him, their ears heard his voice, and their noses smelled the sweet fragrance of fresh bread. It is only when Jesus was at the table with them, blesses and breaks the bread, that they finally see him for who he is.

Mervin LeRoy, the owner of Maxwell's, also opened up the world-famous Tavern on the Green in Central Park, which closed just recently, and TGI Friday's founder Alan Stillman later opened Smith & Wolenski's Steakhouse on 49th and 3rd. Stillman didn't know anyone named Smith or Wolenski, instead he got the names out of a phonebook. LeRoy faired well in the city for decades, boasting such regulars as Cary Grant, Barbara Streisand and Warren Beatty, but didn't have much luck in other cities. A second Maxwell's Plum opened in San Francisco in 1981 at a cost of $7 million but soon closed. His Potomac Restaurant in Washington, DC, the largest in the city's history, opened at a cost of $9 million but closed shortly thereafter. As much as LeRoy tried, he was never able to duplicate the popularity and glamour that his bar/restaurant on 64th and 1st enjoyed throughout the '60s and '70s. The restaurant's ultimate demise came in the '80s, when its food-to-value ratio deteriorated. An average dinner, once around $10 had shot up to around $40-$50. As newer fashionable singles' spots were shooting up all over the city, snatching up many of LeRoy's customers, the restaurant struggled to regain its food image. In the process the menu veered all over, from continental, French, Californian, and American, to a confusing blend of all of these. The iconic bar/restaurant, once a niche in and of itself, was long past its prime in July 1988 and abruptly closed.

It is of great concern to all who understand this glorious concept that Satan and his cohorts are using scientific arguments and nefarious propaganda to lure women away from their primary responsibilities as wives, mothers, and homemakers. We hear so much about emancipation, insidious propaganda belittling the role of motherhood, all of which is Satan’s way of destroying woman, the home, and the family—the basic unit of society.

But why did the lady who started her stint in power with slogans like “change, not revenge” and really surprised and pleased many with her initial civilised ways, reverse her approach so quickly and so decisively? Offering an apologia of sorts, one panelist in a televised discussion on the assault on the JU professor opined that her intolerance or angry reactions should be understood as an expression of the “hyper-sensitivity” of the first woman Chief Minister of West Bengal. Many, including some of her erstwhile supporters and admirers among the intelligentsia, have freely used against her invectives like madness, megalomania, fascist mindset and so on. It has also been observed that a deep-seated sense of personal insecurity lurks behind the CM’s overreaction to criticism.

Recently, my daughter decided she wanted to be a vegetarian, this action infuriated Daddy as we pulled into the barbecue restaurant for my youngest sons birthday. I felt this act was selfish, that she had made up this decision as a way of punishing me for my excellent parenting skills. As I explained that this form of requesting a special dietary option as we pull into barbecue joint was unacceptable. I told her that being a vegetarian is similar to quitting smoking and one must set a quit date for meat.

At some point I actually felt as though the place was just messed up, from the bikers parked at the door, “Team Mini Cooper”, “Team Corolla”, good lord was this a rally or what? The bikers took over the entire VIP area because it was apparently one of the members birthday. I’m not too sure if it is allowed to kick out other normal patrons form a particular designated area all cause of “Bikers” but then again I could just be seen as Bias since I’m not necessarily a biker fan, but I still say they could anger other patrons by doing that.
Clearly, in this case, that system had manifestly failed, as six weeks after the preachings the committee of public affairs wrote to Blackbarony, Stanhope and Dawyck to inform them about the preaching and to chastise them over their failure to act.

Charles, I will have more base and insert cards available for you when you get to 97',98' and 99' Topps.
I attempted to do the 10 days on my own. I ate a lot of quinoa, black beans, and things made with whole wheat flour. I think I lasted maybe 5 days. During the entire time, my stomach hurt and I had terrible gas. I remember too that I tried to go out for a friend’s birthday. I felt so miserable while still trying to eat this way. It was an unpleasant experience for everyone.

The fertility clinic operator who grabbed headlines with his promise to help parents create “designer babies” has backed away from the plan—for the moment. Dr. Jeff Steinberg, director of The Fertility Institutes, earlier this year had offered parents the opportunity to select their future offspring’s hair, eye and skin color by genetically testing embryos. After an outcry, he changed his mind. “Though well intended, we remain sensitive to public perception and feel that any benefit the diagnostic studies may offer are far outweighed by the apparent negative societal impacts involved,” according to a statement posted on the clinic’s Web site this week.
It might have been refreshing, and more open-minded, if the pamphlets had been compiled with several other publishers too, therefore leaving a little more room for something (even slightly) surprising (this list confirms, rather than enlarges, what people already think they know about modern poetry). For instance, John Ashbery or Frank O'Hara might have been included, or a contemporary poet like Riley, or Prynne. That is, drawing on the excellent catalogues from Carcanet, Bloodaxe, and smaller presses - where some major poetry has and does appear.
A housewife named Stephenie Meyer “received” the story of Twilight in a dream on June 2, 2003. The vision she had of a vampire and mortal as lovers compelled her to start writing the story immediately. She says she couldn’t resist the drive to write down her dream (a similar scenario to J.K Rowlings, author of Harry Potter). Meyer gives a summary of that first dream: “I woke up (on that June 2nd) from a very vivid dream. In my dream, two people were having an intense conversation in a meadow in the woods. One of these people was just your average girl. The other person was fantastically beautiful, sparkly, and a vampire. They were discussing the difficulties inherent in the facts that A) they were falling in love with each other while B) the vampire was particularly attracted to the scent of her blood, and was having a difficult time restraining himself from killing her immediately.” Within three months, she had the entire novel written. Within six-months, it had been dreamed, written, and readied for publishing.
I used the Tiddly Inks image Wryn-Close to my Heart for this card. I love that image! It fits so many themes and is just wonderful! I colored her in with my colored pencils, and added glitter to the wings. The papers are all digital papers that I printed off and mounted on pink cardstock.
But that's just my opinion.
Average Afrikaners are not blind to all of this. They understand instinctively that elite Afrikaners such as Du Preez have an apparent aversion to them, and that they cannot expect anyone to act in their interest in response to pressures from the ANC. When Du Preez laments in a recent column the large-scale emigration of tens of thousands of Afrikaners from South Africa in the last couple of years, he argues that this and other factors may imply the eventual extinction of Afrikaners. Crime and affirmative action are given as reasons for emigration.
Having retraced our steps, we found the actual place we should have turned off a little further up the hill. The book neglected to mention how steep the winding steps were to get up to the church, so I shall kindly do that for you. They are, quite.

At home we were able to get the shoes clean, and teeth brushed, face washed, and a little liquid into her. Then she realized we probably weren't going to go to the dance.... and the Crocodile Tears began to flow and then the sobbing... but I pulled myself together for Natalie. I told her if her tummy stopped hurting we would try to go, and a short time later she insisted she felt better. So off we went with the promise to tell me if she started feeling bad again.

All kids raised in the 60s and early 70s watched the Godzilla movies. These old 1950s shows were shown on Saturdays, as I recall, and are perhaps remnants of the collective fear instilled by the explosion of the nuclear weapons in Japan, made manifest through this series about giant beasts of dubious character. But Godzilla’s exploits certainly caused us plenty of thrills as well.

Some analysts suggested that Netanyahu was bowing down to the more rightwing elements in his cabinet – as if the man had, till now, been a peacemaker. The bottom line is that Israel has decided embark on a new and dangerous phase, one that violates not only international law, but Israel’s own self-tailored laws that were designed to colonize the occupied territories. It appears that even those precarious ‘laws’ are no longer capable of meeting the colonial appetite of Israeli settlers and the ruling class.
We don't want people to think we are a "bad parent", so we can tend to feel embarrassed when our kids have big emotions or outbursts. Our kids sense our embarrassment, and it can interfere with the way we respond to our children. If we can stay authentic in our responses to our children, we can help observers to see a new and different way of responding to spirited children. Also, when we feel embarrassed by our child's behaviour, it is because we are not wanting anyone else to judge us or our children. In a sense, in doing this, we are trying to control the other person, too, and manipulate from them the response we want them to have. We can allow them to have their judgmental thoughts, because everyone has a right to their own feelings, even if it's negative towards us.

Tomorrow we are having Jonathan's 8th birthday party. We are having homemade pizza, and for dessert, he does not want cake. He wants oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. He also likes ice cream cake, and Evelyn is an expert at that. So I am thinking to make the cookies for Monday, his actual birthday, for him to bring to school. And yes, I am almost drooling because oatmeal chocolate chip are delectable, I cannot resist them, but I will anyway. This is way too hard!!! Jonathan actually said to me yesterday, as he ate a cookie, "Mom, I bet it's hard for you not to have any of these." I don't walk around saying how much I would love a cookie...most of the time..anyway, I just told him that it is sometimes hard. "Sometimes hard", ha! HA. I feel like I mostly have this big hungry monster in me, wanting to just eat the Reese's Peanut Butter Eggs that Uncle Bob gave to Jonathan, and cereal...I love cereal, haven't had a bowl in like a year. I want to eat a stack of cookies. But I cannot. My dear conscience would not let me enjoy them anymore. When I ration it out that it is okay to have something, I do actually enjoy it. But when I know I shouldn't, it is tainted. I hope I am not crazy, is this all normal dieting behavior?
It's too craptastic to sell, but my goal was to become unafraid/unintimidated by the process. Goal reached! I have to say it's a huge PITA actually. Sawing takes forever. My hand got really tired trying to hold the piece down on the bench pin. My metal shears work well on this gauge metal, but I don't think I could use them on say 16 gauge. (I have a pair of straight shears, and a pair with a left curve that I thought I could use for cutting circles but I haven't tried it yet). Etching takes forever too but at least you can go do something else while it's cooking. I think if I had the right tools/materials it would turn out a lot better. I'm really looking forward to spending more money on that. I love that. Spending money. Because I have so much of it. Money everywhere. Just lying around in big fat piles. Big fat piles of money. You know how it is.

When it comes to Glade Guard you want to keep them cheap since they are vulnerable and any ranged or magic attention will seriously hurt them. This means a command group is pretty pointless on the surface. Look deeper and you will see that they can be very helpful overall. Champions are pretty much useless, the extra +1 BS wont make much difference making him a waste of points. Musicians on the other hand are very good to have around. When a unit charges your glade guard fleeing is often a good tactic and the Musician will let you regroup. Finally the Standard Bearer...you dont want to be in combat so the +1 resolution is not needed however Blood and Glory (Mission) requires standards otherwise you automatically lose the game. Glade Guard are some of the only units able to take them so you might as well. Remember though, if you flee your standard bearer is killed so dont flee unless its ABSOLUTELY necessary. The other bonus is the ability to take a magic standard up to 25 points...which we will go into more detail in a moment.

I am currently nearing the end of The Unlikely Disciple: A Sinner’s Semester at America’s Holiest University, which is Kevin Roose’s account of the semester he spent at Liberty University, the late Rev. Jerry Falwell’s baby, and the largest fundamentalist Christian university in the United States. Roose, whose background is definitely liberal (he transfers to Liberty from Brown), intends this experience as an exercise in participative journalism, necessitating a fair amount of deception. Also, Roose’s timing is uncanny – he records an interview with Falwell just before he (Falwell) suddenly dies. Thus far, it has been highly entertaining reading, and I am endlessly amazed that this book is actually the work of a nineteen-year old.

Alternatively, the option of downloading one of the multiple pieces of software that will enable that feature is also available.

As moms, I know how hard it is to take those moments to slow down. We have agendas, obligations, tasks (some of which have to be completed just to ensure our wee ones live and breath each day with clean little bodies and well fed tummies!). Don’t I know it, as I sit here ticking off my to do list today. And it’s all we can do sometimes to just survive minute by minute, hour by hour. But God’s soft voice quietly reminds me to live the moment, for my days our numbered. Please don’t think me as fatalistic, just truthful. God has given us a timeline here on earth, not to be taken lightly. We have an important job to do, wives to our husbands and moms to our kids, butwe do this all as children of God. He expects us to live this life in a joyful, earnest way, making the most of the moments we have. Of course, He also knows our hearts and how weary mothering can make us. But that is especially when He calls on us to run to Him, to cast our cares to Him, to throw our worries to the wind. You’ve heard it a million times before….the computer will be there to check email, the bills will be waiting, the laundry will never stop growing, and families will not cease to exist if cold cereal is served for dinner. But our children will be grown before we know it. I don’t want to live with regrets, so I will begin each day with these thoughts from Uncle Marvin: don’thurry, don’tworry and take time to smell the flowers.

I on the other hand, have been looking for work since the time I graduated college. Okay, maybe I took a few months off, but once I figured that I need a job, and I REALLY want to work, I decided to go all out and look for work.

And another thing. Completely unrelated. Jamie Oliver's salads are terrific. I bought a Jamie Oliver cookbook for Mr A because he seemed to gravitate towards JO's online recipes when looking for something to cook. The stuff can be a bit over-fiddly (e.g. he grates everything for the fish pie) but usually turns out splendidly. I thought I'd try one of his salads, and his technique, which is to chop everything up quite finely. The first one (cucumber, lettuce, cress, avocado, basil) was astonishingly good, so I tried another this week (carrot, radish, fennel, chicory, lettuce, dill) and together, the ingredients provided a flavour than was far more than the sum of the parts. Wonderful.

My Review: Christine Mehring's debut novel is a beautifully written story of family, enduring love, hope and faith. Megan's life is completely turned upside down when her mother is suddenly killed in a car accident. Left in her grandmother's care, she must face the realities and heart ache of losing someone she loves. She is also faced with the dilemma of making grown-up choices as she tries her best to help her grandmother take on the responsibilities for her two younger sisters. Megan is a very likable character with honest qualities. She makes mistakes just like any other person and your heart aches for her and her struggles. Mehring's writing is open and honest, and I thought this story touched on several important topics such as grief and the importance of coping skills. Megan is left with much of the responsibilities while one sister turns to alcoholism and the other hides in the past. I believe Mehring's portrayal of each individuals' grief is very real and there will be many readers who can easily relate. I liked the flow of the novel. It was a fast read and kept you turning the pages. It was a difficult book to put down. Mehring's characters were well-rounded and believable, and I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fast, touching read. Well done, Christine!
Last week, I got my bramble bush of curly hair trimmed and straightened. As usual, my stylist was bracing himself against his salon station, wiping sweat from his brow, and rehydrating with Gatorade as necessary, as he attacked section by unwieldy section with his flat iron. Needless to say, it’s quite a lengthy process. While he was working, another stylist came over with her iPad and started showing us breathtaking pictures of her recent trip to Australia and New Zealand. And then she got to this series of pictures of her and three of her friends in front of the Sydney Opera House.
Other examples of leading-edge innovation were also discussed, among them a hospital in Illinois which is leading the way in addressing the obesity epidemic through a staff-led weight loss challenge, just like our MiddleNOmore. Then McLaren Racing, of Formula One fame, spoke about the importance of having an information centre to bring together everything the team needed to know in one place. They didn’t know of anyone doing that in healthcare until I mentioned our very own Middlemore Central. We also heard a lot about how the future of healthcare lies in being able to coordinate care better right across the system and grounding it in local areas where patients live. This, of course, resonates with the work we’re already doing around localities planning.

So, here are some of my thoughts, albeit most suited to writers of non-fiction, as I do not write fiction. Most agents represent a mixture of fiction and non-fiction, children’s and young adult material. Read their list carefully and don’t submit any genres they don’t handle.
Given these outcomes - the lack of financial responsibility for absconders and the fact that law enforcement already pick up most no-shows in Houston - using personal bonds instead of commercial bail for lower-risk offenders makes more sense to me all the time.

It is the hypocrisy of Dan Savage’s views that kills me.
The third reason also has some appeal. While philosophers are supposed to be concerned with wisdom rather than with the “sights and sounds”, I recognize the importance of appearances when it comes to matters such as recruitment and reputation. For example, if prospective students and their parents see FAMU students dressed inappropriately for higher education, this might impact their decision to attend FAMU (although our enrollment has been at record levels). As another example, photos of the university that feature inappropriately attired students could also do damage to the school’s reputation. After all, reputation is often more about appearance than substance. Naturally, it might be countered that people should be more concerned with the substance than with the appearance, but that idea seems quaintly out of touch in a time when people assert that “perception is reality.” In any case, if the damage done to the university by the inappropriate attire exceeded the damage done to the students by imposing on their liberty, then the imposition of the code would thus seem morally warranted.

The timing is perfect. I am ready to get off the computer, get outside and try new things! Well at the very least I want to try new things!
Many of you know about my involvement in Midnight Outreach through my church. And you may have heard that I have started writing my second book, which deals with human trafficking and the sex trade industry...
The two leftover thugs show up and draw on Starbuck & Carolee. They herd both of them towards the payroll wagon but Jonah jumps out of the barrel, scales the fence around the arena, grabs a rope and swings to the rescue. Thus the two thugs are beat to a pulp by the most bad-ass clown that ever lived!
Those for whom the bleep test is an approaching nightmare, the yoyo a yearning easily ignored, the skin-fold measuring device as welcome as a dentist’s drill, the press conference a void to be avoided and foot movement a distraction from the job of laying bat on ball, Virenda Sehwag is an idol.

Invisible Children has been condemned time and time again. As a registered not-for-profit, its finances are public. Last year, the organization spent $8,676,614. Only 32% went to direct services (page 6), with much of the rest going to staff salaries, travel and transport, and film production. This is far from ideal for an issue which arguably needs action and aid, not awareness, and Charity Navigator rates their accountability 2/4 stars because they lack an external audit committee. But it goes way deeper than that.
Abraham, remember, had two sons: one by the slave woman and one by the free woman. The son of the slave woman was born by human connivance; the son of the free woman was born by God’s promise. This illustrates the very thing we are dealing with now. The two births represent two ways of being in relationship with God. (Galatians 4:22-23)

Romans 12:9
We want our Prime Minister to seek answers and try and unite us in facing up to some unpleasant realities.
We eventually turned in at about midnight, far too full of food and wine for comfort, wondering whether tomorrow could possibly bring anything that would get close to beating today’s epic flying…
Eventually we reached a dried out riverbed. The Kruger Park falls in a summer rainfall area so in winter waterholes and rivers dry up. As we trudged across the sand we saw a troop of baboons scatter from the riverine scrub, shrieking and barking as they loped away. Next a herd of impala appeared and scattered swiftly in agile leaps and bounds. Ewoudt picked up a handful of sand and let it fall, checking the direction of the wind. We were in a good position, upwind of whatever might emerge from the trees. Again, he motioned us to be silent and led us forward as two elephants appeared from the trees at the river’s edge. We stood maybe 200 m from them as they tore at branches and stripped leaves. Awesome. Amazing. Words cannot do the experience justice.

Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
I think the big question in the minds of many is something that happened like with Google Buzz privacy fiasco where everyone's emails were shared that you had in your contact list and people started asking why people were emailing each other.

The delay in getting your money reminds me of the 5 working day time still needed, even in this electronic age, to clear cheques. It is a racket and disgrace that when you present a cheque, which is then immediately put through a character reading machine and has the amount keyed in, that it STILL has to take 5 working days to ‘get the money’ from the drawer’s account. What happens to the money during this time? And all this time the bank charges you interest and fees (if applicable) on any overdrawn amount. “Oh it hasn’t been cleared yet” is the response. Oh yeah?
No, seriously.

Only these sorts of films feel real to us today. This is not to wish for simpler times, for even clones can fall in love, or have radical politics. Evolution does not go backwards, nor should it. Just as uni-cellular organisms learned to work together to produce more complex life forms, humans can work together to produce transvidual entities, like language, or Wikipedia. And increasingly, this is becoming the rule, transindividuality is a radical series of new potentials for our future, even if it can also go radically wrong. Like all futures, there is great potential for good or bad. And we must learn new forms of love and solidarity for fragmented times. We live in an age in which we are all time-travelers, schizos, amnesiacs, space-travellers, if metaphorically. The question is not about going back, but learning how to make the new world livable, ethical, and just.
Quite aside from the apparent dearth of crime, economics, politics, sport or other news stories of varying degrees of importance, I am left wondering:
Although Nescafe is one of the biggest brands here in our country, Kopiko is selling like hotcakes here, I hope not to exaggerate but it seems to me that Kopiko surpasses coffee sales here in terms of percentage volume. When I go to the supermarket, Kopiko is what people most look for (because this product sells out very quickly).

But there were times when I was reminded — embarrassingly — how big I really was. In elementary school, a group of us kids was playing “Red Rover.” A boy came running at our side and slammed into me, throwing me to the ground. All part of the game, and part of the fun. Until I couldn’t stand up on my very sprained ankle. Our playground was at the bottom of a large hill. A hill I struggled to walk up on my best days, let alone with a sprained ankle. And, unfortunately, I was too big to be carried. I know because someone tried. So what did they do? They came and picked me up in the maintenance tractor. A very small John Deere riding mower with a tiny trailer. They drove me up in the trailer, every single one of my schoolmates watching. And then the school banned “Red Rover.”
My realization came as I drove: I, too, have the right to play my music! I leaned over, turned on the stereo in the car, and filled the world around me with, “Love is a Miracle,” by Delirious:
Strange things happen in the land of Birds and Words. When I read through my user’s guide to my new state-of-the-art Zeiss binoculars, I noticed that they’re supposed to come with a Lens Cleaning Cloth. This extra tidbit really thrilled me because I love receiving little bonus gifts and I searched all over for said cleaning cloth. In fact, I ripped apart the packaging just to make sure it wasn’t lurking somewhere in the recesses of the container. Alas, no cloth.

The ground for the finished artwork is faux parchment used to simulate papyrus, and the medium is watercolour with body colour added for extra detail. Brian decided to use actual hoof prints and footprints to demonstrate the routes taken and, because there were so many of each, resorted to a more basic technology… he made potato cuts in the shape of hooves and sandals, dotted the routes in pencil, then printed directly over them.

So whatever reason I experienced the woman in yellow momentarily in the dream – as odd as it sounds, because of that impression, some of my other impressions of people I have continually known longer, have changed. Maybe we look or see something differently, or maybe we see it from ourselves from another’s perspective. How or why that happens I don’t know. But they do, hopefully in the end, for the better. No matter how short our experiences happen, in dreams or in actual encounters, many can and will lead things into what they are meant to finally be.

The longest of the adventures centers on the Jade Palace (pictured partially above) and has palace intrigue with five different powerful NPCs that players can ally with, which is pretty interesting and nonlinear (especially since it is set in a ruined city full of undead and also has a stuffed tiger zombie). As written, there are many railroad elements, but it has potential (and also seems heavily influenced by Clark Ashton Smith's Empire of the Necromancers). Overall, I can't unreservedly recommend this box in general, but it has enough elements that appeal to my sensibilities to make it worthwhile to me.
The last book I got was The Last Princess by Galaxy Craze. This one is a dystopia that takes place in England and is centered around a young princess who is the only survivor after a revolutionary who makes the royal family his first target.
During the pairings, and as with England, Wales put forward Space Wolves and I jumped at the chance to take them on. Especially as it was Wales's own Captain Mike Collins using them. Me and Mike have known each other for a good while but I have never had the pleasure of playing him. Given that I was relishing the forthcoming Captain vs Captain battle.

The way of salvation must be easy to make it possible for those of every culture and race to accept.

The madness continued outside as we began to race. Some kids wanted to race but wouldn’t hold the toads, some kids wouldn’t put the toads down when they were finished racing, and all of the toads took every opportunity for freedom as they all scattered in different directions when placed on the starting line. Imagine 17 preschool kids and 10 toads in an area that looked to be about 5 ft. squared. There was a moment where a toad was actually dropped by one of the kids on the head of another. I swear it couldn’t have been scripted better for a Little Rascals movie. Talk about insanity. But hilarious at the same time.
PS. I'll post all the details, like what products I used, once I'm all finished. Stay tuned!
This bathroom will be used by guests frequently, so I took a page out of Martha Stewart’s playbook and installed a shade in the closet to conceal the upper shelves when needed. This is a great trick to use in any closet to instantly conceal clutter or an embarassing stockpile of Guns and Ammo magazines before guests arrive.
So what does this say about the future of ebooks? It says that I have a very, very small sampling, but it also says that the future is a lot farther off than many are predicting.

I wish I had a few more (uninterrupted) hours in each day to spend time on crafts and projects, like these little wood color matching peg dolls I made for Kylie. As much as I love a more complex, labor intensive project, I almost enjoy something as simple as this even more- especially since I completed it during the course of just two of her naps. How cute are these?
It's crazy to think that 10 months of training finally reached it's fruition. In the last couple of weeks, I have been a basket of nerves about Race Day, September 11, 2010.

* "Asda's in house legal team send a clear message on fees to their external legal advisors" (Ben Mooneapillay)There were some other very funny entries which, alas, couldn't be listed. Three were definitely defamatory, one might well have been, two were a bit too rude for a blog which prides itself on being good reading for all the family. There were also a couple of entries that were very long and so unfunny that they could have been written by Ibsen -- which made them very funny but not for the right reason. Merpel, who has not been tasked with judging a competition on this blog before, found it difficult to decide between them. In the end she opted for Scott Roberts' entry. Well done, Scott, a copy of the prize will be winging its way to you later this week.

William went on to say that he knew not going to college was the worst decision he had ever made and that he was certain his son would never recover if he make the same mistake. I could see in this man's eyes that he believed what he was saying, that his pain was real, and that it was severe.

Most of Poland's news organisations are today reporting the fact that the Constitutional Tribunal has declared that the enactment of martial law in 1981 was in fact illegal; see for instance TVN24. This is an important step for the healing of modern Poland whilst being also at the same time at tad surreal.

Have you ever ridden on a carousel before? Mostly known as a ‘merry-go-around’, it is a playful, amusement ride that goes in slow circular motion accompanied with background music. Not the most exciting ride as you set into centrifugal force; nevertheless, the participation often invokes a nostalgic feeling to the ‘gallopers’.
6. Don’t substitute a question for a statement. You might think you are “suggesting” increasing the marketing budget by asking, “What about increasing the marketing budget?” in a meeting, but your colleagues aren’t likely to hear an opinion (and certainly not a well thought-out opinion) in your question. When you have something to say, don’t couch it in a question.

The guy was a former construction worker. With a little of budget he could start the business, since Twitter could be a good marketing/promotional tool. And this is not only for his case; it is widely known that Twitter can help small businesses. At the same time, the business owner can get feedback directly from his/her customers, while developing relationships; it would be less risky for small business owners who have limited budget.

And now it's back to my life. Teaching. Wrapping up the year. Maybe before June 8 (our last day) I will know what I am teaching next year! Perhaps before then I will find out if I'm teaching summer school or not (the apps were due on April 19 and we still haven't been told if we got a spot. Lame.). Otherwise, I'm going to assume I'll be in 2nd grade again. I want to be. I've gone back and forth on it...but this is where I am needed right now. And teaching the same grade two years in a row has only happened to me once before...so I'd like to do it again!

I got a surprising phone call from Candace yesterday. Apparently there are some issues with her family, but I'm not going to get into what or why or how. That's her business and not for me to tell the world. I can say that her issues are about the same level of insanity that mine are. She's still complaining about how vanilla her husband is, but at the same time she recognizes that it was her choice to date and then marry him, so she will just have to deal with that. So to cope she writes crazy, pornographic fan fiction. I haven't gotten a chance to read any of it, but I can't wait. The first one she sent me to is about 4,000 words, not that that's a problem. I'm reading about a book a day at the moment. Although, I seem to be having trouble getting through "Pillars of the Earth." She's afraid that when I read it, I'll think she's crazy, but since I already know she's crazy and I love her anyway, I told her not to worry. If what she writes scares me than that's like when I'm perfectly calm. It freaks the fuck out of everyone.

Recently, an ‘ineffective’ manager was leaving my office for a new job. She was asked to hand over her Social Media Plan for our entire department – a file she had been in charge of for the last two years. I had my suspicions as to whether or not she knew what she was doing, since our department had yet to establish any social media accounts on any platforms (aside from a Facebook page I managed to get approved for my particular project by going around her).

Now, before you go on thinking I'm all hypocritical since I do claim to be on his side by the picture on my sidebar, in the first book, up till halfway, I wasn't sure about him at all. The whole 'I'll kill you' dialogue really quite turned me off. Killers are not sexy. Seriously.

Poor little Manny. I tell myself that trauma is good for fruit-bearing flora. I hear that beating an apple tree with a bat is a great way to encourage it to produce more fruit. For some reason, fruit trees see trauma as a reason to batten down the hatches and create extra fruit, or so I read. It is sort of like storing up on food and water when a particularly harsh storm is on the way. I am trying to convince myself that Manny will pull through and be a stronger tree because of his childhood traumas. If this single, solitary, surviving leaf is any indicator, he may be fine. It did grow twice it’s original size in 22 hours.
First up today is the rumoured attempt by Arsenal to hijack Man United’s attempts to sign Dortmund’s Shinji Kagawa. He’s a bloody useful little player – quick feet and bags of invention. I highly doubt that this is anything more than a bit of news intended to ensure United act quickly in sealing the deal, so I won’t be getting my hopes up. Nice idea, though. He’s one of the types of player I’d like to see Arsenal go for.

I've always had a crazy obsession with Mythology, and when I was told about this book I was really excited seeing as how it pays homage to one of my favorite myths of Persephone. We all know the story of Hades and Persephone, but Aimee Carter put a twist in the story that leaves you wanting more. I was hooked from the very beginning, the Prologue grabs you and leave you wanting to continue.
A brief piece of the scene? DB was holding her, covering her mouth with a dishtowel, and yelling obscenities while trying to direct all of us to get into the car. The rest of us were running in circles. The older boys were crying... Bubba was in hysterics saying 'I should have caught her, I should have caught her,' and Lil' Bub was in hysterics saying 'she's gonna be ugly now!!!' I was saying 'oh my God, oh my God' along with 'I can't look, I can't look.'
i miss her optimism. and courage. and determination. i get all teary eyed about her. i really, really do. so much has happened since she dared to dream big. and knowing what i know now about how complicated our stories can be, and how easy it is to get off track, and how gratitude is the only way to joy, i want to reach out and give her a giant bear hug and thank her for reaching out toward something that was greater than herself and embracing all the possibilities that were waiting for her all along.
The point about the continuity of inequality though is that it belies what happens when a layer of working class people improve their living standards, say over 30 or 40 years. We are led to believe that inequality doesn't matter because we've done alright. What this does is break up the idea that we should have institutions in our lives (health, education, housing) which are paid by for all of us, and serve all of us. One trick by our leaders is to keep referring to terms like the 'kitty' or 'in the pot' meaning the sum of money that's raised through taxation - as if that is the sum total of a country's wealth! Meanwhile, the rich and the super-rich are salting away trillions. But, this apparently is not our concern, it's just a necessary part of how 'we' improved our living standards over a two or three decades, say. In fact, for a good deal of time, it's very hard to find out exactly how much this rich and super-rich pot adds up to. And even harder is to find out by how much it increases year on year.

A notably consistent horse, Planet Of Sound has won six and been placed in ten of his 21 races. Bred by his owner, Charles Lloyd-Baker, Planet Of Sound has been trained near Minehead in Somerset throughout his career by Philip Hobbs, who first ran him as a five-year-old in April 2007. Ridden by Richard Johnson the gelding finished third of 16 in a Haydock bumper, was given the summer off and then won when reappearing in a novices’ hurdle at Chepstow in November. He then finished runner-up in three of his next four races before gaining victory number two when beating another John Smith’s Grand national entrant, Calgary Bay, in a hurdle race at Newbury in April 2008. The following November Planet Of Sound made his debut over fences, finishing fourth over 2m at Sandown, but then won twice at Newbury and went to the Cheltenham Festival as a live contender for the Racing Post Arkle Trophy. He finished third to Forpadydeplasterer in that contest, and filled the same place behind Tartak in Aintree’s John Smith’s Manifesto Novices’ Chase. Exeter’s Haldon Gold Cup marked the start of his 2009/10 season’s campaign, but after winning that he fell in Ascot’s Betfair Chase and was only 11th of 13 in the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham. That disappointment was forgotten when he landed the Grade One Punchestown Guinness Gold Cup (beating War Of Attrition), but he managed just two outings the following season (3rd in Haydock’s Betfair Chase, 5th in the King George VI Chase) after suffering with infection in a leg. After 11 months away from the track he ran a blinder at the start of this season when second to Carruthers in Newbury’s Hennessy Gold Cup, and on his only other outing he was third to Tartak in Kempton’s Racing Plus Chase. He has never run over Aintree’s National fences.

The actual plot was good, it keeps the reader guessing what's going to happen until the end. The twists weren't predictable, which made for an entertaining read.

I still don’t know who is evangelical. And asking, “Is your church evangelical?” hasn’t so far gotten the response I’m looking for. I asked a Reformed friend and fellow classicist, and he responded, “Of course we believe in the Gospel!” How do people “get saved” in different churches? The presence of a personal conversion experience seems to be the most visible mark of evangelicalism. Southern Baptists are evangelical; Pentecostals are evangelical; what about Methodists? I know historically, Methodists have been evangelical — but according to the wiki, United Methodists are considered mainline. Now, what the heck is “mainline,” besides “not evangelical”? This again, seems a term searching for a definition.
So, I want to say to you: if you’ve been wanting to write, then just write.

The most convincing portrayal of human lovesickness is in a film called The Name of the Rose. Christian Slater is an apprentice monk who falls for a stunningly sensual beggar girl played by Valentina Vargas. He has no idea what to do about it, but it doesn’t matter because she takes charge of the situation, pulling off the lad’s habit and literally engulfing him in her yearning flesh. Little Christian’s boyish bottom is exposed to the world, while Valentina mews like a cat being simultaneously stroked by eleven pairs of hands. And throughout their brief encounter, they never exchange a single word. Inevitably, it all comes to grief when a bearded troll from the Inquisition arrives at the monastery, charging around the place making reckless accusations and flashing his deadly instruments. The tragic ending is a familiar denouement in human love stories, although in this one the parted lovers do at least escape with their lives.

Waaaay back in November my sons and I decided to create an advent calendar for friends of ours. We thought it would be fun to gather silly gifts to open every day, small animals, a lucky penny, a pretty rock, that sort of thing. Their sons are of an age with these guys and all about collecting, so it seemed a good idea and the collecting begun. Then all hell broke loose with the social calendar and somehow the calendar was forgotten about till it was already well into December. I told them we would do it next year.

The NRC declined to comment directly to accusations it’s reluctant to draw attention to the spent fuel vulnerability at Fukushima Daiichi because it would bring more awareness to the dangers of irradiated storage here in the U.S. But the agency did respond to a question about what it has done to address the vulnerability of spent nuclear fuel storage at U.S. nuclear sites with the Mark I and II designs.

In fact, no lesser a figure than the famous 17th-century English parliamentarian and diarist Samuel Pepys would be similarly tempted. After attending a public dissection at London’s Barber-Surgeons Hall one evening in 1663 he enticed his host to let him see the body alone, a sailor who had been hanged for robbery. Afterwards, in the flickering candlelight, Pepys wrote in his diary what I might have expressed myself if I’d had the vocabulary. “I did touch the body with my bare hand; it felt cold, but methought it was a very unpleasant sight.”

Stella - Pourquoi Pas Moi
I find there is more than just sweet chestnut coppice as the path leads along the top of a slope tree’d with mature beech. An ideal place to stop for lunch, I take a seat just off the path on a convenient stump, decorated with Trametes brackets. While munching away and enjoying the pleasant surroundings, I notice to my left a mound of freshly dug chalky soil downslope of the entrance to a burrow. A couple of minutes on hands and knees and I find evidence of the occupant: a black and white striped hair indicating this is a badger sett (despite their grey appearance, the badger’s guard hairs are in fact white with a black tip). Exploring further, I discover more sett entrances – and a skull, probably that of a young cub, with the lower jaw still intact and attached.

Every year at Flats we have internships for people who want to know more about us and our neighbourhood. (If you don’t know much about the community we live in, click here) Saying that we do something every year implies consistency and sameness … and there is some of that for sure. But there is also a lot of different-ness and re-configuring that happens every year with our internships. In my three years, no two years have looked the same.
The last part, making it a crime for an illegal alien to seek or perform work is one that might have trouble flying. In the immigration law of 1986, Congress specifically decriminalized this aspect, and most of the focus has been on penalizing employers.

Pardon, dearest Lord, my sins and misdemeanors for your mercy’s sake, for tho’ I do not deserve it, yet you having merited it for me, I request it on your score. You have done abundantly more than sufficient to satisfy for all my debts; I therefore lay claim to pardon. Grant it me then, since I can pay you more than enough; for I give you, dear Jesus, your death and passion, which you have given me, with the which you must needs be satisfied, and I cleared from guilt.

Beyond the fun, though, Double Mountain is doing something rare and possibly unique in America, and Kriek Kamp brought it home. In the age of industrialization and globalization, every region is a good region to brew. That's actually a good thing--it means breweries have ready access to perfectly fresh, clean ingredients, and don't have to wait for the season to change before they can brew. But it also means most breweries are divorced from their own weather, their terroir.

In front of the school were some fifty buses (forty-eight, to be exact) that wait daily for students to embark.

Hope you enjoy this perfect summer sandwich and I’d love to hear about any additions anyone can think of. I think basil would taste good on here too (I love it in my Thai food) and could definitely take a little more heat by replacing the jalapenos with serranos. Also, if you’re not a carnivore, grilled tofu or portobello mushrooms could be a great sub for the meat, you could even prepare them the exact same way with the soy and sweet sauce. I thought about mixing the mayo with a little hoisin and Sri Racha too to create my own “secret sauce.” Yum. Kyle squeezed lime juice on his sandwich too, I will try that next time for sure.
There is a parent maintenance act but how many are aware of it or avail its benefits. The fact that we should need a maintenance act for our own parents is such a shame but it does help those who are neglected and abused.
This year, I came up with the idea to use some of the hankies to make a table runner instead. I wanted to make more of these for gifts, so I decided to use the kids' hankies that had been mine as a child in blocks for a sample table runner and see how it all worked out. I decided to use the hankies as "doilies" or "napkins" under various tea-themed items such as teapots, teacups, etc. which I would applique out of coordinating fabric. Well! It took quite awhile, and some time on the part of several craft forum friends, to find enough motifs to use for the tea-themed items, but in the end, I ended up with more than enough ideas.

Having faith is something that's been a struggle for me most of my life. I have a bit of a Wednesday Adams streak in me.

How can you have faith the sun will rise when it might just go kaboom while you sleep?

Stuff Your Rucsack is a charity, set up by BBC Presenter Kate Humble in the UK, and is a very simple idea, which has enormous potential to benefit millions around the world. Anyone can sign up and anyone can list a need, and if people are going on holiday, then they look up the country they plan to visit, and find someone that they think they can help. That might be something as simple as pens for a school in Africa, or dog treats for a dog shelter, or calpol for an orphanage, pictures for the wall, or a book with pictures in it.

His shortcut led out onto a lower bend in the cobbled road, and Tupper turned downhill, jogging along as he strained his ears for the sound of hooves on stone. No telltale clip-clop reached him, but when he rounded the next bend, he caught the jingle of harnesses. To his surprise, the agent’s high-wheeled carriage was parked on a level stretch of the road. The lead stallion greeted him with a soft nicker, and the other horses’ ears pricked forward. At first, Tupper was afraid Rimbles might spook them, but Aurelius’s team was obviously used to seeing all kinds of odd things.
More likely to happen, though, is what happens in real life. We’re all human. I’ve seen sloppy and biased professional assessments, and I’ve seen some that can only be explained by unbridled partisanship if not downright malice, and I’m sorry to report that there isn’t always a long line of colleagues waiting for their chance to correct the record. People are busy enough already. They’re not always willing to risk their relationship with someone they know by speaking out on a subject where they don’t see themselves as unquestioned experts. And, well, they don’t want to be the impolite person who derails the discussion and makes the whole place unpleasant, so they maintain the decorum and tone down their disagreement.
Of course, I’ve been having a little bit of trouble keeping to working on it a little bit every day. I’ve been keeping myself entertained productively with a lot of other things – in terms of this project, settling on character designs, messing with the designs in different poses to see if they fit the character and I like working with them, practicing my digital painting skills, and namely a lot of things involving my little project-devoted sketchbook and my tablet.
Then after finishing that up, I moved over to the pistol line and shot some of the new rounds I'd ordered for my Smith and Wesson Model 58 .41 Magnum. I thought that I was getting a good deal on some target loads, but I didn't read the fine print on the internet ad page and I learned too ate that they were only "cowboy" loads, loaded light for Cowboy Action Shooting. They're only pushing 800fps instead of the 1250fps or so that I prefer, but they still go "BANG!" and I've got some nice Starline brass to reload when the cases are empty. So I whacked away at the falling plates on my range for a bit, well on my way to developing a practice that I call "conservation shooting" (always leave one standing...for future generations, you know.). Ideally I like to drop six plates for six shots, finishing a string with no plates and no rounds left, but today it just wasn't there other than sporadically. I guess if I'm attacked by six bad guys (and don't have a reload handy), I'll ust have to be content with dropping five and hoping that the last one changes his mind.

Not too long ago here in South Bend, F invited, K, L, and I to go eat at Ponderosa Steakhouse, a place that resembles Sizzler’s but without the charming name and make-your-own tostada bar. F, K, L & I have been trying to find places around town to eat and hang out besides our homes with little luck. (Often times people just tell us to do nature-y things outside of town when we ask what there is to do around here.) After telling F about the Ponderosa Steakhouse building that sits awkwardly in the middle of what might be the largest parking lot in all of America, F enthusiastically with a hint of sarcasm told us that it was a great place to eat as a kid. Like Sizzler, all the Ponderosas, F told us, had pretty much closed up shop. For historical reasons, we had to eat at Ponderosa as it has become a relic of the buffet boom of the eighties. Those sneeze guards and forest green decor — a trait that Sizzler and Ponderosa both share — makes this buffet a living museum of American middle-class family eating culture born out of the suburban eighties.

One final note about Migrants and Strangers in an African Society: for years, I had been using the working title “Exile Knows no Dignity,” which is a Bamanan proverb referring both to the humiliations migrants endure and to the place-bound nature of identity formation in contemporary African societies. I was attached to this title because it encapsulates so much of what the book is about. My editor at Indiana University Press prevailed on me to change it, however, arguing that the proverb was too cryptic to make a good book title. In the age of online search engines, the argument went, a title should clearly convey the subject matter within the first 42 characters. So we took my working subtitle — “Migrants and Strangers in an African City” — and made it the new title, while the old working title was distilled into the new subtitle. Not so poetic, but it gets the job done.

I have my favorite cookies to bake up at holiday time, but there's always the excitement of trying out something new for my cookie tray and I'm happy to report that the Dried Fruit Cookies I made from her recipe (p. 87 - subbing in a blend of sorghum, tapioca starch, white rice flour and a 1/2 tsp. of xanthan gum for the wheat flour to make them gluten-free) made a wonderful batch of cookies that disappeared in no time. The cookies were chewy and studded with nuggets of dried cranberries, with a hint of cinnamon. Perfect!
People who are diagnosed with HIV experience stigma and discrimination due to a variety of factors. Many people continue to be uneducated about HIV/AIDS and remain fearful that they may be infected by casual contact. Lambda Legal issued a report on HIV stigma and discrimination which found that 34% of individuals had false beliefs about HIV transmission, including mistakenly believing that transmission can occur through sharing a drinking glass, touching a toilet seat, or swimming in the same pool. The same report noted that disclosure of one’s HIV status can lead to wrongful termination from a job, wrongful eviction from one’s residence, denial of services, or assault.
Under current law, teacher seniority is the sole consideration when layoffs are necessary, unless districts negotiate otherwise. The Pioneer Press reported earlier this year that Minnesota is one of only 11 states that require districts to use seniority as the deciding factor in layoff decisions.

This hole that grief has opened, both into the universe and into the human psyche, might bring me to the truth I seek. And even if it doesn’t take me where I want/need to go, it’s still a gift. Not many people are privileged to find their cosmic twin, to be connected to another human, soul to soul, as we were, and grief is the price I have to pay. Sometimes the price seems too high and I’d like to fling the gift back where it came from, but other times, it almost makes sense, as if the universe is unfolding the way it should be.

Conch Villaheights was on the outermost edge of the Conch and nowhere near the scenic region. It was a dated, rundown building on the verge of urban decay. As she neared the building Tina checked her wrist meter and noticed a dip in positive energy production. If there was a noticeable decline over a block away, she wondered how bad it would be at the actually investigation site. The Villaheight was a restored relic. Some of its columns and window trim were actual Indiana limestone, quarried from nearby Bloomington, but most of the stone work was now synthetic and looked better than the original, which were pitted and stained beyond repair. Tina walked up the graded entrance to the foyer doors and tapped a key on the klantien cover beneath the building's grid number. The cover opened on invisible hinges and Tina leaned in, checking the codes. She waved her wrist over the instrument and checked the readings next to her personal meter. Not good. This building had not only fallen below negative output, it was now sucking life from the surrounding blocks.

In reality, this is Ben’s reward for being on the show. He gets to force women into a game of sexual favors where if they say no, they aren’t opening up (literally) or being vulnerable. If they do have sex, it better be good sex or HE’S OUT. It’s even better on the Bachelorette where girls triple their sex count in the course of 3 days. It’s so uncomfortable. It’s filled with awkward moments like the “hot tub makeout” and the “I’m closing the door because it’s time for doing it” and of course “lie in a bed of rose petals and preheat the oven”.

I’m a Red Seal Certified Journeyman (Journeywoman?) Industrial Instrumentation Tech. I have a ton of safety training, and approximately 5 years experience in the pulp and paper industry. And again, I can’t find a job anywhere in Nova Scotia.

For a moment she just lay there, too stunned to move, stars circled in front of her eyes. She shook her head and pushed her body upright, kneeling and then she stood to dust off the dirt and ash. A wave of dizziness hit her and she thought she was going to be sick, but the air thinned and cleared, enough for her to see hazy outlines of trees, buildings, and maybe life. She sprang up ignoring the pungent fumes and humid air; she was going to die if she didn’t get out of here, she felt certain of that. Her visions had never been like this, ever. This felt very real. She darted in the direction that was free of smog. Perspiration broke out across her back and she covered her mouth as best she could.Where the hell am I and what on earth is going on? Instinct told her, she had astrally projected once more, but this did little to comfort her. The view cleared even more, to reveal utter devastation, some kind of disaster must have happened, row upon row of small wooden buildings had been torched, and only charcoal, skeletal, frames remained. Everything was black or smoldering. Clouds of smoke were filling the air again, she called out, but there was no one to hear her futile cries.

The first loss to the Comets was earned. We stunk. Our best hitter, Matt Conners, was home sick with the flu. “So you’ve thrown up three times today. Drink some Gatorade and you’ll be fine!” I begged him. We were close, so very close, but as he was tying his cleats, he puked for the fourth time.
I tasted a Special Edition sake called "Cloudless Sky,"which was a Nigori, having sat on the lees for four months, but the lees were then removed. So it went from being a "cloudy" sake to a "cloudless" one. This is the first time I have ever tasted such a sake and it was interesting, with tastes of canteloupe and melon, but with a more herbal finish. The Momokawa Pearl ($12) is a more traditional Nigori, sweet, thick and creamy with a prominent coconut taste. The Momokawa Organic Nigori is a thinner, less sweet sake with more restrained tropical fruit flavors. It has been very popular at the sake tastings I have held.

Entertainment has become something that’s blurred when it comes to when and where you can enjoy it. At some distant time in the past, if you were not at home or in your car, you had no real choice of entertainment. Naturally, you could always just enjoy the great outdoors, although for arguments sake we will only refer to entertainment as music and media. You would watch television at home and listen to music in your car or at home.
I have figured out that my eating is strongly related to stress. When I get stressed, I suddenly want to eat out more. Lots more. I’ve figured out that, in relation to last week’s session about expectations about myself (and what I feel I should be doing or need to be doing at any given moment) that I have a LOT of expectations about what I feel I should be eating. And when I do eat out, I really down on myself for doing so. I’ve had to learn to not spew this out, because it makes my SO feel like crap as well. He feels cock blocked because if he makes me eat in, and eat things I don’t want to eat, I’m a bear to him. And if he lets me eat out, I turn the whole event into some shit fest about how “we really need to get this under control”. It’s pretty much lose lose for both of us. And while I’m curbing how much of it he sees, I’m still thinking it to myself.
But what is happening here from a purely operational point of view?
So once I’ve finished writing a new character into a new world and their story has wrapped up to a point where I can call the draft ‘finished’ and maybe even after a few edits and some time on the shelf the first thing I want to do is write what happens next.

I'm smack in the middle of reading The Paris Wife. I'm enjoying it so far, the premise is intriguing and the author's voice is quite easy to cozy up to which is just what one needs on a rainy Seattle night (see: all of them). For those who don't know, The Paris Wife is told from the (imagined) perspective of Earnest Hemingway's first wife Hadley Richardson. It takes place in 1920s Paris which is not a hard sell for this reader, regardless of the subject matter.

I am not exaggerating when I say their output is prolific, but, probably–honestly–not world-shattering, when compared with the Big Five. But I think I am preaching to the congregation when I say that most people reading this are big supporters of Indy Publishers because, as writers, we believe we have gone it alone for so long; along come brave-new-worlders bringing publishing to a more human level (less hype, more oomph); and we are delighted that the indy field is opening out to include more individuals–like us. It seems not only logical, but the most writer-friendly way to go.

Immediately, all the confidence I had in this weekend started to fade. I don't feel that it is my responsibility to travel any distance to pick him up for visitation. I also don't feel that I need to schedule the visitation at some random McDonald's in town so he can see Myles. You can say that I want things on my terms. The court order uses the word 'agreeable' when mentioning the times that we set for visitation. I don't remember the specifics about location, but if it says anything at all, it is probably worded along the same lines. What happens if we don't agree, though? What then?

To be honest, until I saw my logo in that freezer on my TV screen in my living room, I wasn't even sure it had even worked. After all, I'd never even attempted to ship ice cream. All I knew was it wasn't easy, and it was expensive. But I did have two aces up my ice cream covered sleeve - a source for dry ice. I've had this on my wall for a few years now...

It was taken at 1am, and there’s nothing I like about it, and that what makes it a perfect ‘Before’ photo!
The Minister has asked for research on the connection between registered design rights and innovation. The majority of designers in the UK and, indeed globally, rely on unregistered and informal rights. Having said that many designers rely on all the formal rights registered trade marks, copyright and to a much lesser extent patents, why then single out design right in the context of innovation through design?
So you can imagine our surprise when that test result (the first pregnancy test I had ever taken) was positive. I thought, surely I did something wrong while taking it. In fact, Heath was in such a state of shock he sat on the bathroom floor for about 10 minutes staring blankly at the directions looking for some kind of error. However, after a couple of hours went by and it started to sink in, we were like little kids in a candy store overflowing with excitement!
Walter has just burst into Nina's office, announcing that he has figured out how to get William back from the dead (or from the disintegration of his atoms that happened when he gave his electromagnetic energy to save Olivia, Peter and Walter when the three of them were trapped in the other universe... not sure it's the same thing...). He grabs the bell and the little hammer William gave Nina, and...
I’m not sure exactly when it happened. It might have been stalking me for months before I knew it was there, the thought gives me goose bumps and turns my mouth sour. Like when someone decides to tell you they know your deepest darkest secret and have known for much too long. The walk out of my building in the morning always made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. When I think about it I realize, I never entirely understood why. I would just chalk it up to the fact that I hate mornings with a burning passion that could eclipse the sun if it had a physical form. But now I wonder if it was because of that thing. Regardless, it’s here now and every morning is a race for my life. The first time it happened I thought I was going insane. I was leaving my apartment like any other day. The minute I slid the key from my door I knew something was watching me. I felt its eyes burning holes straight through me with a hatred and a hunger I couldn’t explain. The click of the latch on the lock of my front door was a hunting horn, a snap of a twig under the dainty hoof of the deer in the wolf’s territory. I think it was in that way that I knew, on some primal level, that I was square in its gaze.
Just a few years later...
Two weeks ago, I suddenly got homesick. Luckily, it only lasted for about three days. It was really weird, because I hadn't felt like this for over more than a year. Job not being at home for three days didn't really help ;), so I gave in to look at the website of the Book People and order some books for the boys.

I love the delicate look created by the overlay and the ribbon-threaded handle. It's small enough that it only takes a handful of chocolates or other goodies to fill it up, but it's big enough to hold a chocolate bunny or even a small gift, and the reinforcement of the ribbon threaded through the handle and around the body of the basket makes it sturdy enough to hold them! I've included some rick-rack (not used in mine) in the file to give you some decorating options to make several baskets that look different, or so that you have a less frilly version for the males on your Easter gift list.

Sunday has always felt right to me as the proper day to undertake household chores. Maybe it has something to do with my Lutheran guilt that I no longer attend church. If I can’t sit through another interminable sermon about how Zachariah slew Obidiah after Jebediah stole his Uriah Heep album, perhaps I should endure the equivalent anguish of running the vacuum cleaner. Though I didn’t quite get to the carpet on this particular Sunday (unless you count the part where I fell down while dusting the fireplace), I did accomplish the following:

Ah the bucolic life – farming for a living. A lifestyle choice that gives rise to the idea days are spent growing your own healthy delicious food for yourself, your family, and for others. Images of tractors rolling across verdant fields, the sun setting on the hot summer days with a herd of cows lowing in the background, sheep munching on the pastured hillside, and of course the poultry of every variety pecking and scratching happily in the soil. It is true, it does look like this – from the outside, the dream life of farming. It is accurate that all of those things are part of why I choose to be a farmer and yet there is the undiscovered or should I say, undisclosed side of farming that all who venture here might consider.
Finally, when buying a laptop, beware that you do not overspend. First create your budget and stick to it. When you think that you have found the laptop that you want, do not rush into it. Wait a day and check over your budget, requirements, and see if you are still as excited about the laptop in the morning, as you were when the sales clerk was showing off its specs. If you still feel that it is the laptop that you want to purchase, then go for it.

The stretch between the parking lot and the point turned out to be one of the most productive of the morning, giving us looks at at least one Red-necked Grebe, our only Ruddy Duck of the day, and four Common Loons, along with the usual Mallards, American Wigeon, and Lesser Scaup which have been regular sightings for the spring course so far. Out beyond the range of my camera lens were dozens of Franklin’s Gulls, Bufflehead, and even more Lesser Scaup, in impressive numbers, with a few Common Goldeneye mixed in. After reaching the point, we took a look around and spotted a few American Coots near shore, which was another new bird for our group this year.

I’m not sure what I’m trying to get at here; I’m just really sick of everyone trying to be an individual, or at least think they’re trying to be. These days, being an individual means being ahead of trends in fashion, music and movies (and being a snob about it). It’s even worse that everyone wants everyone else to notice how much of an individual they are (blogging possibly being the worst sin in this area). To me, being an individual is not what you wear, what you listen to, what you watch, but purely that you are.
I have always wanted to roast mushrooms. I never used to like them, but I’ve become more accustomed to them now (and quite fond of wild mushrooms). I think properly roasting anything makes it taste amazing, so I thought fro sure that roasting these lovely little mushrooms would bring out the earthy goodness of them. It did. However, there is one simple rule to preparing good roasted mushrooms. Make sure your mushrooms are clean. Whatever you do, do NOT submerge your mushrooms in water. That can damage their delicate form and make them mushy when cooked. Simply wipe them off with a damp cloth or paper towel.
The apostle Paul frequently referred to giving thanks: he gave thanks for people (Phil. 1:3), for the faith of converts (Rom. 1:8), for obedience of believers (Rom. 6:17), for spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 14:18), for victory over sin (1 Cor. 15:57), for answered prayers (2 Cor. 1:11), for people who cared for others (2 Cor. 8:15), for the gift of grace provided through Christ (2 Cor. 9:15), for financial support of the ministry (2 Cor. 9:12), for believers (Eph. 1:16), for pleasant memories of people (Phil. 1:3), for joy (1 Thess. 3:9), for strength and being chose for service for God (1 Tim. 1:12), for everything (Eph. 5:20).
I miss the theatre, though, and have thought about it often. It’s just one of the many things I used to do, way back before children, which I hardly ever do now. When there was a new staging of A Raisin in the Sun recently, I wanted to go – but I couldn’t think of anyone who would go with me. I kept telling myself I would buy tickets, but I never did.

One of our widely held values (one I share) is that we should protect our young from sexual exploitation by older members of the species. Here is a big problem in this regard: we are “gened” to reproduce. We reproduce too enthusiastically. When we were very sparse in number, this trait helped us survive. We no longer need it. By my subjective evaluation, we overpopulate the world by a least a factor of 100, perhaps more.

Daniel and his friends were the “best and brightest” of the young men of Jerusalem. And they were royalty (Daniel 1:3-4). The Babylonians changed their names. “Daniel” meant “God is my judge.” “Belteshazzar” meant “Bel protect his life.” “Hananiah” meant “the Lord shows grace.” “Shadrach meant “command of Aku (the moon-god).” “Mishael” meant “who is like God?” “Meshach” meant “who like Aku?” “Azariah” meant “the Lord is my help.” “Abednego” meant “servant of Nego.”

One of the most important parts of blogging or publicising your crafting skills is how you display your finished objects and/or products. I was thinking about producing a little ‘how-to’ or ‘top-tips’ post about the same, until I spotted a sudden rash of posts about exactly that subject. However, I am decidedly not a photographer, so acting like an authority on this issue would be a bit cheeky. Here’s a few links to some of the most useful posts I found.
My first question was this… if you are not losing weight with Weight Watchers are you being honest with yourself? Did you track what you were eating – accurately? That means measuring your portions – accurately. That means tracking EVERYTHING that you put in your mouth – EVERYTHING…

There’s a step beyond this, one that combines several of the principles we’ve discussed here already, but the best way to make sense of this further step involves a detour involving ancient Greece, modern California, and one of the more interesting figures in 20th-century occultism, the Austrian philosopher and mystic Rudolf Steiner.

But one fine day Uncle W allowed us to take a book back home. It was an Indian cookbook, by a lady called Rohini Singh. I don't remember the name, and I don't think its in print anymore. To my childish eyes it was a marvellous and beautiful book, with a lovely purple cover. It too, was filled with exotic Northern Indian dishes like murgh makhani (butter chicken), malai kofta (meatballs in a creamy curry) and desserts like sandesh (a bengali dessert) and rasmalai.

“But no one doubts that Communism will win, or at least I know of no one who doubts it – I can confide this to you because the hour is twelve midnight, and a man becomes loose-tongued then, if not downright frivolous. You, on the other hand, are not conditioned against Communism and you have no occasion to be afraid of it; so for that reason you can be a Communist if you like, it’s quite becoming for a healthy country girl from the north to be a Communist – more so, at least, than being a lady.”
I won't be traveling to and from India this winter, so I'm hoping to have time on my hands to make my way through most of these over the holidays.
Perhaps, most tellingly, while she vacations in Biarritz—a town near the Bay of Biscay in France—she gets into a conversation with a Swedish woman named Lena (Carita) who is much more gregarious than she is (hell, when they meet, she's sunbathing while fully topless); while they both share a drink, Lena calls over a couple of guys and starts flirting with them. What does Delphine do while all this goes down? She just sits there, looking more uncomfortable by the minute, not even bothering to jump into the conversation even when Lena tries to give her cues to join in. Finally, she can't take it anymore, gets up and flees back to her hotel room, already thinking of leaving the next day.
The big down-side of the Finder is that there is a long opening along the sides of the channels at the narrow end. I assume that this is to allow the cups to slide smoothly, but I find that it tends to allow the treats to fall through the base onto the floor beneath. Perhaps once the dogs become a little more skilled at removing the cups without shaking the toy around too much, this won't be an issue. You could also use larger treats that don't fit through the openings or spread some soft treat (wet dog food, peanut butter, etc.) on the inside of the cup to serve as a reward.

Postpartum incontinence may result from muscle and nerve damage during childbirth due to delivery of a large baby, prolonged labor, excessive pushing, a forceps delivery, or an episiotomy (an incision made during delivery to prevent tearing of maternal tissue).

History (along with a bit of common sense) tells us that tax cuts stimulate the economy, due to the very basic reality that when people can keep more of their own money they will have more money to spend. Tax increases, fee increases and a departure from a free market economy to more government control over our lives is a formula for disaster.
For those who find themselves in the pit now, remember that God will reach low to you and He will lift you up. You cannot be so deep in the darkness to be beyond His ability to save you. You cannot be so covered in dirt that He’s scared away or disgusted.

I have only two observations to make on this:
scholarship - I visited students' home to verify that they're really that poor. And yes, they were really that poor. One fascinating part about this was that after handing out the scholarship, these students began to see me with an extra glimmer of light in their eyes.
The guys at this site here did some tests. based on their tests 3 coats will probably do the job for what I have in mind, but I'm going to go ahead and do a 6 coat layer.

I know, I know. Spring Break is supposed to a drunken week full of crazy shenanigans. But my family and I are really close, and when my parents were like, want to go to Atlantis for your spring break? We'll play with dolphins and I was like, uh, yeah. I'm not the kind of person who says no to kissing a real live dolphin.
The witches used scrolls for witchcraft in those times. Some of them survive even today. Besides the spells, the witches also used some herbs and animal parts to make potions to cure some diseases and heal the wounds. Potions were brewed in cauldrons in order to combine them properly. Cauldrons were often made of wood, but other materials such as stones were also used. These potions, though denigrated as superstitious, were quite efficacious in those times as they are equally efficacious now.
We go up to St James's Hotel where all the journalists are staying. We meet Jonathan Steele, chief foreign correspondent at the Guardian. He agrees to take our remaining films, the tapes we made from the radio and also a hand written 'War Diary' that I have been compiling from my notes for our families and friends. He will deliver these back in England to the photo agency and to a friend who will type up and distribute the diary.

My sister is bugging me to read Stephanie Meyer’s Twilight series because she thinks I will get a lot of hits – but I just can’t bring myself to do it. Not only have I already been told the entire story, been forced to watch the first few movies (which were terrible), I’ve also read about two pages of my friend’s copy of the first book. It was average writing at best – only a person who doesn’t read anything would be impressed by it. I couldn’t be bothered wasting precious hours of my reading and living time on it.
I no longer feel the need to validate my love with a piece of paper. It meant nothing in my previous relationship and has caused nothing but grief in the divorce.
The footwear of lies did not do their worst, but they weren’t kind, either. I was glad to seat myself at a table with a pair of women speaking some Slavic language. For all intents and purposes, I was alone. I had a mug brimming with Hungarian coffee. I had I Capture the Castle.

In closing I applaud those men who are not afraid to say they prefer to date transsexuals and do not worry about what society will think. But please be aware that the greatest sacrifice is made by those who are transgendered and have to struggle with the constant abuse that society and ignorant men prey upon them.

I could be pragmatic and say that it is because those calves represent our livelihood–our income. We do our job to ensure as many live, healthy calves as possible. But, in reality, there is a different reason it is special. It is hard to explain, but when you see a newborn calf get up and begin to nurse–you cannot help but smile when you see its little tail swishing back and forth. And nothing beats watching a group of calves running out in the pasture, playing games that resemble “hide and seek”, and “tag”.

However, my phone then starts to ring, and I see that he’s trying to Face Time me (our new favorite thing since he got an iPhone), and he says that he’s managed to get four tickets for tonights The Voice live show in Elstree and would we like to go? If I’m totally honest, I haven’t really been watching it that much, I’ve seen a few episodes but I know my wife likes it, and a live show could be fun, so we gratefully accept his invitation and are told that he’ll pick us up at 2pm (about three and a half hours from now).

I am ready to go forward and see what 2011 has in store. I usually don't make New Year's Resolutions, so I will just call this a goal. My goal for 2011 is to try to document my life better, good or bad. That is the reason I started this blog in the first place, and I got too busy to do it.
Fast forward a couple of years. We landed in New London in 2008 and haven't gone all that far since then. But all of a sudden in 2012 we could hear the dulcet tones of our niece way down there in central North Carolina singing: "Aunt Ellie . . . Uncle Bill . . . I'm graduating in a few weeks!"
Over time, I’ve become increasingly agitated at Blanc’s new location… teeny-bopper staff, scuffed painted concrete floors, inconsistent music and the general feeling that I’m eating in someone’s refinished basement are all kind of adding up. But these were all forgivable sins for what was, to me, the best burger-eating experience in town. But now Josh Eans is gone. Quality is going downhill. Service, too. And the menu is even changing. All signs of a place that feels like it’s finally well enough established to make some cutbacks on quality and increase profit margins.

Movies and dogs are pretty much my two favorite things in the world. So when you combine the two of them, I'm in hog heaven. This year, some canine talent burst onto the scene that could easily be compared to the star power of Asta or Lassie. Beyond those career-defining roles, various films this year were positively peppered with pooches. I'm not just calling them out for being cute, but I truly believe that they were all strong screen presences, even those with limited screen time. Oh, and they're cute!

Eliza was a GREAT big sister (and leader) and didn't play with Isabelle even though she kept trying to tell Eliza knock knock jokes and peeking over Eliza's bed (which is conveniently located directly to the side of Elle's bed!) And Isabelle did a great job falling to sleep in her new bed! Minh Lee only had to sit with his back facing her for about 10 mins and she was out. She slept through the night and woke at 6ish and I went down, said "it's still night night, lay down" - she laid right down, I covered her up and sat in there for 5 mins. She then slept through both showers and until 7:30! YAY Isabelle! :) I'm so excited and proud of her!

The very first time I tried to dye something was around 1980 and I was living in Hoboken. I got some turquoise procion dye in a little packet from Pearl Paint in Manhattan. It came with it’s own little bit of soda ash. It all seemed so complicated. I wanted to try batik. I melted some beeswax and painted this giant sheet. I think I painted a huge unicorn or something on it. Anyway I filled a small garbage can with dye and soda ash and water and put the sheet in. Then I left it there for like six weeks. I just didn’t know what to do with it. Everyday I would walk by it in the kitchen and have that same anxious feeling I just told you about. So one day I started to wring it out in the bathtub and turquoise was everywhere. Oh my god I was making a huge mess! I got a big old black garbage bag and threw the whole thing out. I was turquoise up to my elbows and very sad.
Wow. I had no idea. And, my anonymous source of a tongue lashing was right. I don’t know. I don’t know about Ferraro’s because I've never eaten there. Actually, I've only eaten at a handful of restaurants in Montana. It is true, as I said earlier, that according to my taste and dining expectations, I've not been impressed with Montana’s restaurants. However, based on my limited experience, my door knocker was right. I don’t know squat about Montana’s restaurants and thoughtlessly gave opinion when I had no right to. For that, I woefully apologize. Hurting Montana is the last thing I want to do. New prairie Woman is not about “that” and if you've been reading my book, you know that I love this place and have no intention of hurting it. I celebrate this magnificent place. I honor Montana, its people, wildlife, mountains, lakes and rivers, its extreme experience. And while I’m here apologizing let me say this…the fact that a local person took the time to drop by my back door speaks volumes about the people here. This young man takes pride in “The last best place,” his home. This is his home and I insulted it. Please excuse me for becoming just another ignorant source of bad information. It will not happen again……….
This past week we met with a speech therapist who is going to write our IEP. Long story short our regular speech therapist has not seen Kristen since November because she has been out on medical leave. We have had three different people working with Kristen in the meantime. Therefore, I decided I needed to evaluate last year's goals and see what I thought we needed to set for next year due to the lack of a consistent speech therapist monitoring her progress. It has been me...the mom therapist.
Presently in custody, at the Lynchburg Juvenile Detention Center, are three blacks: 16-year-old Kenneth Davis, who reportedly initiated the attack, 16-year-old Vernon Jackson, and an unnamed 13-year-old boy. The 16-year-olds have been charged with first-degree murder and, as per Virginia state law, are presently set to be tried as adults, with the U.S. Supreme Court having taken the death penalty off the table, due to their age.

After I moved away from home, Spaghetti Bolognese was one of the few things I knew how to cook, and I made it a little too often. When I became a vegetarian, I never bothered to seek out a new recipe for it or convert my old one. Then, I came across one on Tastespotting from What Would Cathy Eat, and I knew I had to make it. Cathy writes "This one is particularly chewy and meat-like, because it has not just one, but three “meaty” ingredients: tempeh, mushrooms and lentils. Could this be the vegan holy trinity?" Yes. Yes it is. It also helps that it has a cup of red wine in it.
My annoyance is with the yard. There is so much to do to the yard! The previous owners neglected it quite a bit, so I have a lot of work to do to bring it back up to speed. All the other homes in my neighborhood have really nice yards, so I want to clean up my yard to match. At least repairs on the yard are inexpensive.
From the picture above, it looks like my child has very well-developed lips (yikes! obviously s/he takes after momma, cuz I have one GIANT lip that I appear to have passed on), and the technician told us that she could see TONS of hair on the wonton’s head. She said, “It looks kinda curly,” but then wouldn’t commit when I pressed her more. I didn’t know they could tell if your kid had curly hair from inside the womb! Now if it turns out to be curly AND ginger, I’ll be over the moon, even if s/he did end up with my hugely ridiculous lower lip. Though I suppose my own boring old brown straight hair would also be ok, even in combination with a mutant lip. It seems to be ok for me, so I suppose it will have to do for my baby. The wonton will just have bigger lips for me to kiss, which sort of makes me happy.

This time, instead of 20-plus birds in the birdie bin at PetSmart, there were only five. By process of elimination (too much like Ollie, too big, too old, too reserved, too much digging under the feathers…does that one have a skin infection or something?), we settled on this little blue girl. And it was decided she would be named “Wendy,” which sounds a little bit like the town we live in. It’s a stretch, but you can make it work. Also, she’s blue. Like the Wendy in Peter Pan, Wendy in the blue nightgown, Wendy who the Lost Boys called “Wendy Bird.” That’s a stretch, too. But whatever.

Brands like H & M that embrace opportunities in Cause Marketing, illustrating corporate social responsibility, and position themselves to build their brand reputation and value with their targeted customer base. Numerous studies show consumers are basing their purchase decisions on preferences for brands demonstrating an authentic involvement in a good cause.

I find inspiration in the oddest of places. Sometimes it's a news story or article I've read, maybe it's someone on Oprah, it could be from reading a friend's post on Facebook even. But my most recent bout of inspiration came from the tv show Ugly Betty. It may not be the best show on tv - it can be predictable and sometimes I feel embarassed for the characters (a personal trait of mine that I don't like), but Betty is a 20-something who knows what she wants and has goals. After many months of pondering what I want to accomplish I decided to write down my goals for 2010. I really don't know what I want long term other than health and happiness, so for now I have a list of about 15 short term goals. Most revolve around cleaning and organization, but I also want to read more, watch less tv, make healthier meals, walk Gizmo more, volunteer or make charitable donations, and establish date nights for Dean and me. I didn't really create goals for Ryan because his milestones will come when he's ready, I'm more concerned that he laughs each day - so I guess that's goal 16 - make Ryan laugh each day.

It's the Sydney Opera House of interior design magazines: surprising, refined, a little edgy (I love the way it always curves off in unexpected but joyous directions) and distinctly Australian. It also has a cheeky spirit wrapped inside that taut, dignified body. You could almost say it's the Hugh Jackman of glossies, but let's clear the screen of magazine analogies now.

We packed up after about and hour and a half since we had been out canoeing in Elk Horn Slough for the hour and a half before beach time. On the way back out to the road we stopped and watched the sea otters for a time. They come into the protected and more quiet waters of the slough during the day and sleep in rafts. They are sure cute in action, but I found they are not so easy to capture well on my camera. They just look like a furry mess!
Here’s a story about Draupadi and Bheem I heard a long time ago. At the time of her marriage to the five Pandavas, she had declared that she would spend one year with each of the brothers and during that year, no other brother would enter the chambers that she and her husband-of-the-year shared.

To the gentlemen – Let go of all that nonsense about the size of your penis. I know it’s inescapable, but you have what you have – so get over it. If you’re smaller, so what? There are MANY ways to get a lover off that don’t rely on you being large, and there are many toys to help if that’s what you want to do. Become a master of your partner’s genitals and body, and your penis size will not matter – trust me. Now, if you happen to be larger in the penis department, PLEASE don’t rely on that – so many men with large penises do. I have heard a lot of complaints about that over the years – where men decide that skill is not needed, because a large penis automatically makes you great in bed. It doesn’t, so you need to get over your size as well. Accept what you have – large, small or in between – and make the most of your penis… and your hands… and your mouth… your skin… and toys too. Why not? Sex is so much more than your penis – enjoy it all!

Rich Warren was a prodigy; a fantastically talented songwriter and guitarist who had been in various bands since he was a teenager. He signed his first deal with Heavenly as one-third of the Hybirds in 1996, when Britpop was at its peak. Like most bands at that time there was a huge buzz of anticipation surrounding the Hybirds - retro-rockers carved in the image of the Jam and the Who, with Rich's inspired riffing elevating it above the dross - but they only released one album in 1997, and split at the end of the decade.

“Whoever you are, bear in mind that appearance is not reality. Some people act like extroverts but the effort costs them in energy, authenticity and even physical health. Others seem aloof or self-contained, but their inner landscapes are rich and full of drama. So the next time you see a person with a composed face and a soft voice, remember that inside her mind she might be solving an equation, composing a sonnet, designing a hat. She might, that is, be deploying the powers of quiet.”

I gave Jake instructions to let the kids ONLY eat salad, since the rest of the day was filled with junk food, and went to take a nap. I was fried. I got to sleep from 4-5. At 5pm, I woke up, and helped the stragglers get some salad (sometimes the big kids are only helpful to themselves - hehe), and honestly, I don't remember what I did between 5 and 7. I think I was on the computer for a bit. Maybe it took me longer to wake up at 5pm. Maybe it was more like 5:30 before I went out. Who knows.

“Yes, you remembered.” A secret thrill raced over her knowing he’d recalled her name. But the thought of the letter from his girl slowed her racing heart. “I…ah…do hope you received good news from home yesterday.”
Eli Amir was born in Baghdad into the Iraqi Jewish community. As a teenager he went into exile with over 90% of his community who all left within a year, "unprecedented in the history of refugees," Eli told us. "Only one place would take us, Israel." He went on to become a ministerial adviser on Arab affairs and immigrant absorption.
Authorities announced that they had expelled 48 of more than 2,000 African refugees who have entered illegally from Egypt in recent weeks. Officials said they would allow 500 Darfurians among them to remain, but would deport everyone else back to Egypt and accept no more illegal migrants from Darfur or other places.
And if we end up feeling that we'd trade all our tomorrows for a single yesterday, then it must have been a superb yesterday at the time.

Another Gucci man, Christian Bale whose suit looks great but seriously needs a shave. The caveman look just doesn't do at the Oscars. His date looks nice in that black dress. It could be any number of designers, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani Privé, Calvin Klein or a someone totally different. Do you know?
Actually it is quite funny and appropriate that the animal the ANC has been feeding for decades has now turned on its master. Or is it the other way around? Is the master now consuming the beast? I’m sure you get the point…
Does this really hold up as an argument in this person’s defense?
What makes a movie a Hollywood blockbuster? Is it a multimillion budget? Do the celebrity actors count? The treasure chest and celebrity may help. But the real magic is in the work that goes on before that magical premier, before the record box office sales.

At least one commissioner believes the report should become a 'publicly sanctioned history' which 'can be taught in schools', to the exclusion of 'contradictory versions'. This, too, is an Orwellian notion, paving the way for renewed political indoctrination.

Petula Clark began her showbiz career on British radio during WW2, was one of the pioneers of UK television, she was a successful film actress and all of that before she began her recording career. She had a string of hit songs through the 60s, and has branched out into stage musicals and theatre

Obama has placed himself and his regime in an untenable position… providing that there are Conservative Republicans who will throw off the ‘official’ Repubic policy of not attacking Obama directly on his policies. His intent is nothing more, nor less, than the destruction of the American Republic and the freedoms for which it stands. MaoBama and his ‘academic’ leftists know full well that the fastest route to total subjugation of the American people is through relentless assaults against the energy sectors of our nation.
They can hardly believe that television was not a 24/7 presence or that telephones were all landlines – what else could they possibly be? MacDonald’s was still a mom-and-pop outlet in a small town in the USA instead of a pop culture presence around the world.
So with heavy heart I sit here before getting ready to work, tired and frustrated. It’s not a bad day and I don’t feel bad, it’s frustrating not sleeping and knowing full well why you can’t sleep but unable to solve it. So, here’s to a great day. I have a therapy appointment on Thursday so I’ll get head shrinked and zapped back into shape and maybe only kill off one more person tonight (in my dream).
Have you said any of these before? (I know I have.)
1. The American Diabetes Association is not working towards a cure. The organization is run by and serves the interests of the industries that profit from people with diabetes: drug companies, food companies, and doctors. It funds very little research of any kind, but concentrates on "education" which is centered on teaching people with diabetes that they can "eat normally" and, despite a decade of research contradicting this concept defines "tight control" as a blood sugar less than 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/L) two hours after a meal--a level that guarantees complications.
2). Robert Griffin III, QB to Washington.

My first designer handbag was Gucci. I was 21. This purchase was closely followed by a highly sought after Louis Vuitton which I carried proudly to the office. My boss told me "that bag will last you a lifetime", I used it everyday for about 6 years. It didn't, but it was the start of a love affair that was to continue for a very long time.
#1: Marriage. What's the deal-io with everyone getting all hitched and everything? It's like there's a new announcement in the mail or on the Book of Face every week. I feel as if I am severely lacking in an area of my life even though I know I am not. But hello, it's like all the sudden a numerous amount of classmates of mine have decided to tie the knot, jump the broom, and seal the deal. I have turned nineteen so therefore, my Mormon biological clock feels like its ticking...tick..tick...just jokes my friends, just jokes. We all know I'm far too little to be getting married.
Mum would always have our favorite game ready when we got back from guising with our loot. It was called “dookin’ for apples”. In this modified version of bobbing for apples, each player uses a fork to literally stake their prize. Kneeling on the back of a chair, you lean over a basin of water and apples and drop your fork down, hoping to spear one. I was always very good at this game and even got my apple in the first try several times. Another favorite game was one in which a treacle or syrup covered scone was hung on a string and you had to bite it down without using your hands. Needless to say it was a laugh to see your friends and family members covered in a sticky mess.
Sit quietly for a moment and think about what you carry around inside of you. What weighs you down? What detracts from your happiness? Write it down, take a look at what you wrote. How do you go about releasing the baggage that you are carrying around with you? That really is the hard part isn’t it? Letting go.

One most striking characteristic of this home-consumption stout is its consistent condition. It is not so consistent — comparably less so — when it crosses the water. Guinness's draught stouts and porters for Irish trade never seem to have either too much head or too little. The writer is not very familiar with other best brands, but these doubtless also possess this distinctive quality. Strangest of all, even though a cask should stand on an ullage of merely a gallon or two for a considerable time the contents still draw off with the usual firm, close, quiet-looking head. How different from the tempestuous, fiery, overflowing condition one so often sees in English stouts. You may judge a new delivery of porter to be flat, flatter than you ever knew it. You draw off a sample in a glass, and it looks black and uninviting. But let the glass stand for a few seconds, and then, when not before was a speck, the creamy foam, luscious like the head of a gyle as fermentation is just getting under way, appears on top. It is the universal practice to draw off to the last pint without vent. If condition is not good enough to force the liquid out of tap without air-pegging, it is not, according to popular taste, good enough to drink.
1) Mix up the exercise - I know it is inevitable to lose some muscle along with fat every week, especially with these large losses I have been having, but I am not a fan of that "Body Fat %" number going up on my scale. I know I need to continue the great cardio I have been doing, as well as get back to strength training. I hope to work that in this week.

Value for money
When we got to the playground on Chestnut, the dad pulled out a booklet of Paratransit tickets. I thought that was odd. People who use Paratransit tickets are usually old and/or disabled. But I didn't think too much about it. The fare was $17.05. I counted all the tickets in the booklet, and there was $18 worth. I also made sure that the white trip report sheet was on top and that it was signed. Without the trip report, the tickets aren't worth anything.
In all my years living in Toronto, no one had ever spoken to me in line at a store. In fact, we had lectures in high school on how to avoid making eye contact with anyone so as to prevent unpleasant situations, such as people starting up a spontaneous conversation about the weather.
Based on the published evidence and some interviews, my own view remains that the Tapie case in general is something and nothing. On the other hand, linked to a conspiracy to get DSK out of the 2012 Presidential campaign, a string of allegations against her would play badly for Sarkozy – whose performance in opinion polls is less than sparkling as it is. Certainly, six weeks ago the Elysee staff had to admit that they had known about DSK’s arrest even before the arraignment – in fact, as he was being pulled off the plane at Kennedy.

If you look up the word awe in the dictionary you will find the word fear listed as a synonym, thats the kind of fear where looking at here. But the context the Bible uses seems to make fear of God more of a conscious action, where as I understand awe as something we are struck with – it happens to us. Fear in the biblical context is something we choose and can be found lacking in, so there is a difference there.

The females of this species hide their young in their stomachs throughout the incubation period, and then give birth to them through their mouths. But in order for this to happen, a number of adjustments have to be made, all at the same time and with no mistakes allowed: The egg-structure has to be set up, the stomach acid must be neutralized, and the mothers have to be able to live for weeks without feeding.

Jonah's Injuries - obviously beaten up and knocked out
I have participated in my fair share of therapy. You might have guessed that if you have been reading my blog for very long. (I hope you have) And, as a result of all of that therapy I tend to over analyze my own thinking, feelings and have lengthy conversations with the third party voice in my head. I was once told that this is a symptom of co-dependence, and maybe it is. Either way, the voice, I am willing to concede, is my own voice doubting and judging myself. Because of this doubting judge I always second guess my feelings of being taken advantage of, or perhaps being used. Those are kind of harsh words for what I mean, but you get the gist. I tend to be over generous, something I have also been told is a symptom of co-dependence, always trying to be nice, please and gain favor by others and to keep the peace, etc. Maybe all true, either way, again, it is who I am and while I am aware of the therapeutic analogies that go along with the behaviors, I cannot for the life of me stop myself from getting into situations where I have been kind and generous to a person.Then feeling after a period of time that I have fallen prey to someone who is wholly capable to taking advantage of the situation and thereby rendering me PISSED....at them and myself.

It won't be here for another two weeks, but I'm looking forward to getting it and enjoying the benefits not only for my knee but for my overall health.

Please be aware that this project has been developing far faster as anyone (especially me) expected. 90% of the time since the idea of me opening a CrossFit box in Stuttgart developed late last year, I was working in Iraq and had to do most planning over the internet. I resigned just before Christmas in order to be able to put 100% effort into the project and we had a lucky break getting our place right after.
After Macy’s I talked to Patrick about the vests and the suits. The sale was just for the jacket and pants and it wasn’t very good. It would have been $220 then the vest was $75 and we would still need the shirt and tie, which would probably be another $50. We just could not ask the guys to spend $350 on a suit for a wedding … and that is before tax!

And this is where our careers (please insert your own inverted commas in relation to me) diverge slightly. Now, and I’m sure you’ll agree, although our lives have been all but identical up to this point, while I, enraged at not getting my own way enough of the time exited the theatrical profession in an epic internal hissyfit of epic proportions and quietly sulked, Tod continued to work in film, TV and on stage right up until his death in 1956.

Ultimately, cost-cutting should come in the form of prison closures, just as other states have done in response to impending budget crises. In Texas, the Hilltop, Huntsville and Sugarland's Central units are each more than 100 years old; technologically ill-equipped and outdated, they are seeing inflated prisoner costs-per-day.

It’s a busy time of the year, lots of things going on, everyone’s getting ready for the Holidays. There’s a great buzz in the streets and in the stores, but there are those who are opportunistic and are waiting in the shadows to reap the rewards of other’s hard efforts. This can be as devastating as a carjacking, or it can be as crushing as having the new stereo you got from your loved ones stolen while you sleep.

This is a race of creatures that can be used as a player race, should the DM approve. It sounds like quite a neat idea for some kinda subterranean adventure. A way to avoid the whole you have to be either a drow, druegar, svirfneblin or any of the classic human-like underground races.

Now, let’s take it from the ultimately more important aspect in question: the wearer herself. Why does she wear a cloth over her head? The reasons every hijabi might give you will differ, without a doubt. It should, however, eventually boil down to one main reason – she chooses to cover up for the sake of God. This will make sense the first time you hear it, and the second, third and fourth, and so on – until you decide to start thinking about it.
3. Lack of interest. With every challenge (even when I was posting regularly) interest would start off strong and dwindle down to a few people by the end of the challenge. True, this may be due to my lack of networking and promoting the blog, but I spend so much time networking for my other blogs and Facebook pages that I honestly don't have the time to adaquately promote this blog too.

A similarly titled book, “Games People Play” – written in the 1960′s – dealt with human relationships and the patterns we exhibit in forming relationships. Behavioral patterns which uncannily mimic those of more primitive primates, such as ‘tit for tat,’ reciprocation, altruism, and punishment.
To keep with the vintage theme, I wanted my gown to look very old world so when I found the chantilly lace mermaid gown at Vera Wang I knew it was the one. I picked a simple veil with a silk edge and went to Regina B to pick out beautiful gold and crystal vintage style hair combs to add to my updo. For the bridesmaids, we picked Amsale empire waist long chiffon gowns that were looked very 1800’s. We chose Pacific Blue as the color because it was so striking and different and would be a wonderful contrast the plush greenery in Ireland. We found the flower girl dresses at a tiny little boutique in Soho and they were just so whimsical and fairy-like I loved them.
For our last dish (I was still jetlagged and not ready for a full on meal with dessert etc.), we had the Fried Sticky Rice with Preserved Sausage ($168HK / ~$21US). This though amazingly delicious - you can taste the individual grains of rice distinctly, and fragrance released by a nice hot wok (always one of the signs of the chef's skill), with rich but perfectly restrained flavors punctuated by bits of juicy preserved sausage. Our only complaint about this dish would be the price - it's mysteriously more than the one with truffle, and doesn't have a lot of seafood in it (beyond the shreds of dried scallop).

Details, some smaller and some larger, show her femme-leanings. Her longer hair as a teenager versus her elementary school coiffure stands out the most. But we can add to the list her love of skirts, and her decisions to conform to the social requirements of modesty for women (notice that she wears pants when she stands on a chair to put up posters?). She sits halfway between the proscriptive Kana who’s adherence to traditional feminine ritual brings her strength and purpose, and many “guys with breasts” characters who seem less “aware” of their gender and more resigned to it (see: Konata Izumi). What makes her character work is an earnest and unironic position in regard to her womanhood. While being a girl doesn’t define Chihaya, she would be a different person were she a boy. You can’t understand her without taking gender into account.
Sadye had been Sarah, living a boring life, wanting something more, and then she met Demi during the auditions for the drama camp and they instantly click. Before, Sadye loved musicals and drama; and the week before she meets Demi, she gets a new haircut and a new wardrobe, turning herself into someone who (she thinks) is more glam, more drama, less suburban mall. And then she meets Demi and her life falls into place.
Many times new devotees, who enter the movement have raised a question to me; Prabhu, it is difficult to believe that such senior devotees who did so much service to Srila Prabhupada would actually deviate and fall for such ambition. This is easily understood from your own teachings about the ‘shajiya’ trap or pitfall that a practitioner of bhakti is prone to fall into if he one is not careful.

He reached over to touch my left hand, first patting it then grabbing it, clenching it tightly and strongly. He turned to look at me, a great giant in my mind, suffering silently. Without warning, this lost man had come to me. Without words, he had been holding out, eyeing me as I had eyed him. And between us we understood love and redemption.

The boys have always had their own rooms but given a choice, HRH would rather share space with his brother. From Mom and Dad's standpoint, HRH camping in Gremlin's room increases the chances of a full night's sleep for everyone. IT's called a win-win - except the obvious fooling around, blanket disruption, tossing of stuffed animals, and moving of beds (really?) that accompanies shared sleeping space. So in and out the parents go; cajoling, threatening, ultimately separating. The problem is that Grem actually prefers to sleep by himself so as the instigator, he's got nothing to lose and I've lost hand.
The President went to great lengths to conceal the full nature of his disease from the American people and from foreign leaders. He asked the press to never photograph him in his wheel chair. When in public, he walked with the aid of a cane and by holding tightly to his son James’s arm. Well he didn’t really “walk”, he couldn’t. With great effort, he had to grip his son’s right arm, and with his upper body strength, rotate and thrust forward his left leg. Then with his right hand and cane, propel his right leg forward. Over and over. Grip… thrust… cane…thrust… grip, thrust, cane, thrust. Observers have said that it was done so meticulously, it simulated the act of walking.

You never want to get into this situation, so it’s nice to have someone take you to the side and have you think a bit about what you are about to do.

Every little bit of information that you can get from your purchase will help you out.

This next shot I like for the sheer fun of it. Again the wide-angle lens has played its role here, overemphasising what’s close to the glass and throwing all else into the distance. A.’s hand and arm are large, almost claw-like as she crawls out of the rock, and she seems disproportionately large compared to the rest of the scene. At the end of the day it’s just a fun image, brought to life by the distorting effect of the wide glass.
Panel 2: In Jurassic Park the companies names are InGen and BioSyn. (I don’t think the latter is named in the movie, but it’s there in the book). Swapping their last syllables seemed the easiest way to change their names to me back in the day. Also note the bit someone wanting a coke. Get used to lines like that. 12-year-old me thought they were hilarious, and only got better with repetition. You can also see, in this panel, where I’d penciled the dialog and then unsuccessfully tried to erase it before inking the page.
A few days ago, Nancy graciously allowed me to take a peek and snap some progress pictures to share with all of her friends on the blog. CP2 is looking very different than she did back in mid-November. The soot is gone. The heavy smoke-laden odor is gone. All of the fire and water damaged debris is gone.

Someone seemed to think it would be The Best Idea Ever (c) to send the U.S.S. Nimitz back to 1941 to fight alongside our boys against the evil Axis powers and help turn the tide in the U.S. of A.'s favor. This is the story of The Final Countdown, a film that has a good idea but... at one crucial moment... it lags.

Which brings me to my beef with the paper: it's very thin and feels crinkly. I didn't see a spec anywhere on the label, but it feels similar to the 15-lb. paper on the Staples graph pad. As a result, the pen leaves an imprint in the paper, so its difficult to use both sides even where show-through is not too bad. Maybe I need to develop a lighter touch.

So, where do you start? If you have some spare chicken wire or old pallets lying around, build yourself a small enclosure. If you don't have an enclosure, don't worry! Just make your pile wherever you want it (out of the direct sunlight is best, but NOT necessary,) and add your scraps as you get them. I add all my kitchen scraps (no meat, just plant material,) all the vegetation that comes out of the garden, and any leaves that are floating around the yard. Each time I start a new pile, I add a garbage bag of straw and chicken manure I get from a friend when she cleans out the chicken coop.

There should be a book on how to figure out boys- except it’s rather difficult and I am sure it would be a very big book. Most guys would say they need a manual for girls- but we are pretty easy to figure out and if you just listened you would know. But if you ask a guy about their complexity, most of my guys friends would reply back saying this standard answer: “oh us guys are simple creatures! We live very simple lives” Yes off course you do…so that’s not true at all. They may not need a lot to please them, but they do tend to do a lot of stupid things! Beware guys- perhaps you should take some lessons from girls people we are always watching YOU! Girls are always analysing.
