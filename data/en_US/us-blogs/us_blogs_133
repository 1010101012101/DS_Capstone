Some days are tough. Very tough. The days when you are torn into shred by the pain and grief. When you want to reach out and hug and wail like baby, when you just want the world to end. When you yearn for the human touch, when voice is not enough and yet it is the only solace you have. When the words get lost in the lungs and you clutch the cell in your fist shut, your blurry eyes , tears streaming down your cheeks, unable to utter anything. When you swing between being a woman and a being a mother and feel helpless and defeated in both roles. When phrases like “hang in there” or ” this too shall pass” sound so hollow, for they don’t lessen the agony one bit.

I made the most of my Saturday - I oozed out of Tai Chi class and went to visit the woman who had bred Sage and Chicky. We straightened out a missing paperwork issue and had a nice visit. I came dangerously close to pocketing a couple of 3-week old Nigerian Dwarf kids on the way out. Then it was constructing the last of the two raised beds I am putting in this year, and I cut the pieces for a cold frame that I want to add at the side of the house - it's perfect: sheltered, a good amount of full, afternoon sun. If there is any sun, that is.
There is no way to sum this one up. The desolation, the anger, the defiant hope.
He starts by describing the Truman Doctrine of “Containment” of the former Soviet Union that was based on the so-called “long telegram” sent to the State Department in 1946 by an advisor in the US embassy in Moscow – and key Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) scholar – George S. Kennan.
These facts pose a compelling argument in favor of a strong probation system when fully understood. Liberals, conservatives and independents alike usually agree when these facts are weighed into the final decision.
When compulsive consumers-cum-critics praise this or that modern piece of referential art, they're pretending that they're spending a lot of time with it and that this is a testament to the quality of the material (they're making a claim then, of the art being essential, as explained above). Do not trust them, divide their claims of how much they've experienced the object of art by ten or more. If they say they've been listening to a record for two months straight, this means they've given it a half-dozen incomplete listens while surfing the internet, perhaps. The reason they're lying is because they know nobody will pay any attention to their recommendations if they were truthful about how they're using the product. Art is still sold on the basis of essentialism even when both critic and consumer do not consume the product with mind to its essential quality. The merit of art has been sidestepped, it has become at best a selling point on a marketing sheet. What is sold and bought instead, is a brief feeling of elation, belonging, an experience of something one already is prepared to experience.
As soon as I saw them peel off their shirts and pants, I was fully awake and alert. I paid more attention to the hotter of the two. I should also note that the beds were bunk beds, and I was on the lower bunk of mine and they were standing next to their bunk adjacent to mine, which was basically perfectly bulge observation level.

Two years ago I wouldn't have a clue what I was talking about either. Two years ago I didn't know what a Blog was. I had no idea that friendship could emerge from writing about the mundane, daft, and heart-rending things that happen day by day. I didn't know that people would drop by and leave comments that would hearten and sustain me through a dark day. Or make me roar with uncontained laughter. Or make me smile right down to my toes. I would have been totally gobsmacked to hear that Blogging could actually produce some real, Top, Friends.

Obviously the opposite is true too.
Lord Vincent concluded that Sutherland’s accusations were fair comment and a reasonable expression of the commonly held opinion that ‘such practices are revolting to the healthy instincts of human nature’. Indeed, Lord Vincent expressed his own opinion that works promoting methods of birth control ‘are calculated to have a most deplorable effect upon the young of both sexes’ and pointed out that Stopes’ works were ‘of such a nature that they were not read aloud’ in the court. The accuracy of Lord Vincent's prediction has become all too clear in our own day (see here and here for evidence of this).

I don't blush. But I thought perhaps I'd do a rosy-cheeked look, because I thought it'd pair well with my Hourglass lip stain. It all came together for one of those fresh-faced looks. I think. I'm not sure. I kept the eye makeup minimal and pink-toned, with winged liner. I tried to beat my brows into some semblance of good behavior and added generous amounts of pink blush. I think I need to do more looks like this just for going out. The Hourglass lip stain is one of my absolute favorites, and I need to showcase it more often.

In the not-too-distant past when things were good and they talked, John had told her stories, probably myths she now realised, of failed early space missions during which space capsules had failed to achieve orbit, instead carrying on into deep space -potentially for ever- with a payload of frozen, suffocated human remains. These stories apparently originated from radio enthusiasts who claimed to have listened in to the last words of these asphyxiating cosmonauts on the frequencies used by Roscosmos. Ever since, whenever she thought about them, she found it difficult to get the images out of her head: frozen, space-suited corpses, each strapped to seat, drifting through the darkness, slowly diverging. She could see them now.

And what does the Bible say? “I prophesied as I was commanded.” I think this means that he did as he was told, and he told as he was told. Then he says, “While I was prophesying, there was a rattling…” You see, here a beautiful thing: Nothing happened until Ezekiel started preaching. Nothing happens apart from the proclamation of the Word of God. If Ezekiel had just stood there, silent, disobedient, nothing would have happened. The bones would not have rattled. The tendons would not have appeared. Flesh would not have appeared. Skin would not have covered the flesh.
Kelly O’Shea just blogged about managing her tests for Standards Based Grading and that inspired me to share my workflow for managing reassessments. I know when I first started out I had a hard time imagining how I was going to manage all of these reassessments, so I think it is helpful for other new adopters to see how other people make things work. I want to mention right off the bat that I am not very talented at organization; I like organization, but I can never manage it myself.

Carmen had lived her whole life in a garbage dump. The social pressure of being made fun of for her shoes was new and completely dislodging for her. It was too much for her to take. She decided to leave school and return to the dump. At least in the dump no one made fun of her. She was the eldest sibling, and her brothers and sisters decided that if she was going to return to the garbage dump, then they were all going to return together.
So I pick her up first and she insists on sitting in the back seat?? I was scratching my head a few times! She stated that she wanted my mom to sit up front… yeah okay Aunt B…and then she is SUPER independent and does NOT want any help regardless if she is using a cane or not! Which is good because she does not let the fact of her experiencing a stroke stop her from doing anything! Praise God.

Some things just speak to you and you want them straight away, having discovered they exist. This is how I felt seeing the trailer for La Vie Murmureé (The Whispered Life), a French documentary about the Japanese writer Dazai. I'd never heard of Osamu Dazai. I watched the clip a few times, it just hypnotised me. I wanted to know more about this writer, who killed himself when he was just 38. I could find no info on the DVD in France
Ok, let’s move to the other point.
I’m going for living writers here. David Malouf’s An Imaginary Life. He writes the body like no one else, and this is my favourite of his I think. Anything by William Trevor or Alice Munro. As for poets, I go back to often, or will eagerly buy anything new by: Les Murray, Robin Robertson, Ken Babstock, Karen Solie, A.E. Stallings, Seamus Heaney. Those are who come to mind today…

Even in the 1920s and 1930s I always knew I was a Scot. So sure was I of my identity that I never minded being called British or English. If called the latter I just thought they were wrong. During the war we were all called English. As I grew up I discovered that my petit bourgeois contemporaries thought that there was no Scotland. It had been absorbed into its greater neighbour. Looking back this is not surprising. The union gave us the chance to expand into the great free trade area that became the British empire. We seized that chance. Glasgow was the empire's second city. We were the workshop of the world.
I really don't know how much posting I'll do now that I'm here and realize how fast a day goes. One has to be in the kitchen by 9 am for breakfast (for me that means after yoga and journal writing) and then one has to lay in the sun and read and then there's lunch again under the grape arbor in the warm sun and then there's the nap and voila! it's time for a beautiful meal, new friends to meet and libations to share. The Norwegians taught me a new word: "skol"! I like my new word.

He took a couple weeks to get it back to me and although the wait was painful it gave me time to pick out the perfect paint color.

Not saying I have any reasons to be depressed, I think I'm just lonely. As a single mother, I can't really go out and do things on a whim. Since most of my friends are my age without kids, they can. That kind of leaves me here..but you know what, it's all worth it. Because of this I get pretty good grades in school, and I read a lot more. =)
The Zohar points to an interesting fact, namely that while Noah is here described as “Ish Tzaddiq Tamim” (איש צדיק תמים), a righteous and whole man, later on he is described as “Ish haAdamah” (איש האדמה), a man of the earth. This is also the case with Yosef later on in the Torah, making a comparison between the two, that they were wealthy men, but didn’t let themselves be taken by earthly desires. So whereas there is a comparison with two Tzaddiqim against Noah’s favor, we also have a comparison with another Tzaddiq in his favor.

- Retief was one of the most influential of the Great Trek leaders. Among those who joined the Great Trek, he was a bit unusual in a couple of respects. He was much better off than most trekkers; at one time he owned over 20 lots in Grahamstown as well as farm properties. As can be seen from his letter (it was translated for publication in the Grahamstown Journal), he was better educated than most who were illiterate or just barely literate.

The Internet is like a teenage boy. It’s noisy and it’s growing so fast it doesn’t know what to do with itself. Which makes sense given that the World Wide Web is in its teens. Though it is slowly becoming more organised, it’s still easy to feel like you’re drowning in information.

Sometimes it feels like a lifetime has passed since I first felt San Francisco’s pull. Various women and friends have come in and out of my life and I’ve spent much of my time over the past few years living out of a bag, sometimes half way around the world. Plus I’ve fallen in love once again; San Francisco is a wonderful city in which to be in love. But of all the things that have within me and without me, one thing has remained constant; my affection and admiration for this city. No matter where I am in the world, I’m always proudest when I say San Francisco is my home and I see someone’s eyes light up. It’s then that I know The City has chosen that person too.

I used GinaK Designs Pure Luxury Kraft cardstock for the base, and used Versamark ink and a verbiage background stamp on the top. I layered some Fiskars DP with some purple cs, in order to relate to the focal image, and upholstered the bottom of the card with it. I really like the sort of glowing leaves in this DP, so I made sure they were visible below the focal image. I tore some value pack black cs to give it a rough edge, and backed my image with it, but this time I attached the black to the base first, and popped the image by itself over the black with some mounting tape. Then I added the owl, the rhinestones, and that was it.
One-third of the companies are not Vietnamese, but rather, companies that generate a substantial part of their revenue from Vietnamese operations. And 37% of the index constituents are financial companies where the long-term viability of financial services is not well known. In all, there may not be a better way to get as much Vietnam exposure than with the new VNM, but VNM is not a typical exchange-traded index fund.

Talk about ‘the right of Muslims to have halal products’ is in the air. What about the right not to eat halal products? Is that in the air as well? If not, why not? This is a big thing. Not just to animal rights activists, but to most British people. But who cares about them? Leftists and left-liberal councils don’t. Anyway, not only are the British people not a minority, they are mainly white. And that clinches it for the Leftists and left-liberals in our councils and in Government.
No, not necessarily the little things, even the big things bothered me. I hate the idea that John Cena berates Alberto Del Rio, like he is nothing. How do you put over a new guy by continuing to slam him, saying he isn’t in his league, and he is a coward? I get it, Del Rio runs away, but damn, at least give him some mic time to defend himself, tell Cena he will prove him wrong this Sunday.

One of the biggest eye-openers for me is how hard it is not to be able to buy something I crave. Often, I'll say to TSC, "What do you want for supper tonight?" or "I feel like roast chicken". Having to stick to a set menu is hard, and I can't imagine how tough it must be for those who really live under the bread line - they don't have the luxury of planning ahead what they'll eat. R12 a day is an average - not something you can bet on. So someone living in poverty might be able to earn R30 doing an odd job on one day, but then earn nothing for the next three.

Here is what I thought to be the hardest part of the project--covering the cereal boxes with fabric. I wish I could tell you exactly how I did it but it was pretty much trial and error.

When I was a kid our family took a trip to Cherokee, North Carolina. I don’t remember much about it, except the long car ride, Dad fussing, us kids looking out the window wondering when and if we were ever going to stop. The little tourist town was filled with the souvenir shops you expect in a place like that. All kinds of “Made in China” things could be bought including little plastic feather head-dresses and rubber tomahawks. I wanted to get my picture made with the Indian who sat in front of the big, colorful tepee, but my parents wouldn’t let me.
To hammer home my point one more time, the huge momentum swing that Gingrich got from winning South Carolina seems to have faded. Straw polls show Romney ahead of him by 9 percentage points in Florida, up from just a 2 percent lead on January 25th. Romney seems to be the favorite once again.

…until whoever’s in charge of the Hunger Games decides that Katniss and Peeta can both win. Because they’re just so in luv and we don’t want to see something really nasty actually happen even though this is a game about death. I spent the entire plot wondering if Katniss really was going to kill Peeta or vice-versa. Even at the very end when they spent a second thinking about killing each other with the berries, I thought that would have been a good ending. I mean, that obviously wouldn’t have worked out in real life, but as for theme of a novel, that would raise good morality questions, such as how could the people in the Capitol go on, knowing that their cheering caused 24 innocent kids to die? Or if Katniss had killed Peeta or vice versa, how about coming back and having everyone cheering for you when you killed by your own hand the one person you really want? See, here’s some good moral questions and ideas that would raise a sequel, prompt discussions, make you think.

The stenographer Alice Sycamore is in love with her boss Tony Kirby, who is the vice-president of the powerful company owned by his greedy father Anthony P. Kirby. Kirby Sr. is dealing a monopoly in the trade of weapons, and needs to buy one last house in a twelve block area owned by Alice’s grandparent Martin Vanderhof. However, Martin is the patriarch of an anarchic and eccentric family where the members do not care for money but for having fun and making friends. When Tony proposes Alice, she states that it would be mandatory to introduce her simple and lunatic family to the snobbish Kirbys, and Tone decides to visit Alice with his parents one day before the scheduled. There is an inevitable clash of classes and lifestyles, the Kirbys spurn the Sycamores and Alice breaks with Tony, changing the lives of the Kirby family.

Proceeds of its Monday Night Wine Club will be donated directly to the Food Coop. That’s $5 out of every $38 three-course wine tasting sold on Monday nights during January.

This set of post we will look at the story of Elijah and look at his powerful encounter with God Almighty. Who was Elijah? Elijah was God’s unpredictable prophet; he never did what people expected. We can see in 1 Kings 18 that he faced over 400 priests of the false god Baal on top of Mt. Carmel. It was a showdown of power. The false priest prayed for fire from heaven, but nothing came. Then Elijah did the unexpected. He poured water over the wood and sacrifice — three times. Then Elijah knelt before the God of Israel to ask for fire to be poured out from heaven like water from a bucket. Elijah was vindicated when God sent fire from heaven. He immediately turned and pointed to the false prophets and yelled to the crowd, "KILL THEM!" But victory was short lived. When Queen Jezebel heard that Elijah had killed them, she sent a royal decree to Elijah by messenger, "I will kill you by this hour tomorrow!"That’s when Elijah ran away. He could stand against over 400 false prophets of Baal—he was bold—but this woman sent him running. He ran into the desert and told God he wanted to die. He fell asleep under a juniper tree and an angel awakened him and gave him food and water and he went back to sleep. The angel awakened him a second time and told him to eat and drink again because it was going to be difficult. Elijah gets up and goes to Mount Horeb when God asks him a question then has him stand on top of the mountain because He was going to pass by. Heavy winds came and God was not in the wind, an Earthquake came and God was not in it, fire came and God was not in that, and finally a gentle breeze came and that is where God was. God then sends Elijah back with a three fold task to do. God dealt with Elijah’s discouragement by putting him to work. (Click here to read Biblical account of Elijah’s Encounter)

I was very disappointed with Romeo this week. I agreed with Len 100%, he took a major step backwards. Maybe Rumba was a bad choice. I suppose he could have danced Foxtrot if he wanted. He had no hip action, unfinished leg lines, and terrible heel leads. A heel lead, for those who don’t know, is when the step is taken with the heel first, instead of the toe. In Latin dancing, generally, the steps should be taken with a toe lead. All of our Rumba dancing gentlemen were guilty of heel leads, but Romeo’s was by far the worse.

This is truly a multi-cultural book, but one that also highlights the difficulties people can sometimes face when trying to fit into other cultures, or when you're homesick for the country and culture you know and grew up with. No matter who you are or where you end up, feelings are the same the world over and it can be strange when you're outside of your comfort zone and trying to fit in, but also deeply rewarding too. Too learn about other cultures and traditions in such a child-friendly way can only help promote greater understanding of different cultures, and the book also includes a small dictionary of word definitions and a rather yummy sounding recipe that I really must try myself.

A correct sketch of the life of the deceased would fill a volume of stirring interest. He was among the number who sought our inviting shores as a refuge from the wrongs and oppressions of the old world, during the first few years of the present century. We believe he was a native of the city of Hamburg, and served in the wars of Europe, first against the French, but being made prisoner, afterwards espoused the cause of Napoleon, and served through several campaigns up to the battle of Austerlitz, at which place, we believe it was, he was severely wounded. He then returned to France, and married a wife in the city of Lyons. He has resided in this county for twenty-three or four years.

“In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of unreliable elements. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them.”

Have you ever thought how terrible it is to see these little, freakish children rubbing their noses all over the place? And how horrible the caretakers of these children are because they have neglected the welfare of their noses? No, I’m pretty sure that most view these advertisements as an attack on other brands like Kleenex and the sort. And just look at the varieties of product they have! Filled with nose irritating vapors and lotions so that you need to buy more when your nose becomes inflamed and reacts to these substances. And aren’t these wonderful Puffs tissues supposed to help you and comfort you when you’re at your worst? But they are just taking advantage of you and your wallet by claiming their tissues are the best there are! How could anyone feel good about that? Puffs take money and paychecks away from doctors, nurses, handkerchief makers, Kleenex employees and not to mention the local small business. What a truly diabolical brand.

Other plants surrendered their roots, leaves, berries and fruits to make dyes. One lichen, called Qaqasunkha (family Usneaceae) comes with a caution. Although natural dyes tend to be less toxic (but not always) and better for the environment, gathering large amounts of lichen could actually be detrimental to the environment. So here is another example of the dangers of making a general statement about using only natural dyes.

Nicholas Sparks came back with yet another story of timeless love that definitely sears deeply into one’s raw emotions. It dwells around two individuals who fell madly and deeply in love when they were young, but got separated by the entire world that was against them. Twenty-five years passed and now with separate lives, they never thought their fates would cross once more as both of them were bound to return to their hometown due to the sudden death of someone they both hold dear to their hearts. Never did they imagine that their visit would re-live all their memories in the past, stirring their feelings once more, and leaving them with the question if love could truly rewrite the past. The book reveals their struggle in facing what has become of them during the lifetime they had been apart, discovering that once true love settles in, it can never go away. In the end, it’s just a matter of choice and a series of consequences.

It has been 27 years since the death of pianist/composer Thelonious Monk in 1982. He was never a fan of jazz-rock in the late ’60s and early ’70s, so I don’t think he would have found anything of interest in the smooth jazz movement that he’s missed since his passing.

In our home, we seldom eat meat. On a normal day, our meals will more likely resemble a handful of side dishes full of seasonal vegetables, fruit, beans and grains rather than a centerpiece of animal. However there are exceptions, like when my father brings us his homemade wontons, or a premium cut to celebrate Father's day, when we eat out, and when we know that the meat we are eating has been raised the way it was supposed to. You know the pastoral images, green grass, sunshine rays, happy cows.
The next day, my son and I were back in the garden to “save da tapoes!” In an act of complete deja vu, we (again, by “we” I mean “I”) uncovered all of the mulch, and replaced it with the dirt we took out last week… then I promptly slammed my face into a wall out of frustration. Why would potato growers grow their crops in mulch, when soil is better? Upon further research, I found that the individual potatoes actually form from the lower stem, above the roots. The “mulch” is used as a medium for the potatoes, not the roots. oi!

I have a hard time verbalizing my feelings, which is why I prefer to write them down. Being pregnant has been hard, because my hormones seem to intensify my emotions. I feel my emotions much more strongly than ever before, which makes it challenging to control them and properly evaluate them. I have had a lot on my mind recently, but I have not felt comfortable talking about this with anyone, because I didn’t think that people would understand. As a result of bottling up my emotions, I’ve hurt those around me, because I have been unhappy and angry with myself. I'm sorry for my actions and am thankful that God's working on me!

The United line-up hardly inspires confidence. Scholes had a decent game, but with him and Giggs in the team, and the blitz policy in force in the first half, they were never going to last the whole game. Manchester United’s best player, Valencia, was left on the bench and brought on way too late to make any difference. Their other star, Rooney, was back to his angry old self, and did absolutely nothing, except contrive to get Kompany booked for Rooney kicking his boot.

Three days after my brother's funeral, I laid on the floor, on my stomach, curled up and sobbed. It was the first time I really let go of my emotions and sobbed. Up until that point, I had cried,of course, but there was much to be done, to include being strong for my parents. I don't remember how long I laid there, but my husband says it was hours. He knows because the entire time, he laid on top of me and held me. At some point, I pulled myself together and moved forward. One of the things I said to my husband was that I wanted to show my kids how to handle hardships. How to deal with the worst life has to offer and to come out the other side, not just alive, but living. It took me about a year after my brother killed himself until I fully felt like myself. Durning that year, I had a lot of good days. Days that I laughed and days that I smiled, but from time to time, I would get overwhelmed by the emotions of anger I felt at him or the enormous amount of loss I felt not having him around and when those times came, I let them out. I cried and talked about how I felt and then I moved on. The time between "break-downs" got longer and longer until they just didn't happen any more. Now my kids were very young then, so I shielded them from a lot as I do today, but when they ask about that time, I can tell them, I had days where I just laid in bed, but the days I got up far out weighed the ones when I didn't and I am so glad I did because look at what I would have missed.

But it needs to be the norm instead of the exception.
The photo is of my 'workspace' in my studio. Well... half of it. The other is just as big and just as filled. The window is a North window. I like a mix of natural light and artificial for color choices, so I spend most of my time at this desk.
Here is Christmas Bread number 2: stollen. You really can't go wrong with fruit and almonds in a delicate and slightly sweetened bread. Dusted with icing sugar, this is a true holiday treat that makes this time of year so special. I prefer the marzipan centre to adding sliced almonds, but the choice is yours. This bread comes together much faster than the panettone because it has no final proofing and goes straight into the oven right after you shape the loaves.
that was easy. the answer was definitely ‘no’ to that one. i assumed they gave no sort of a shit, even for a second, much like myself who just wanted to read this same sentence while i waited for the doctor to call me up, and tell me that my father was going to live another day. wisely enough – i still believe this now – i kept my mouth shut. but i stared at her. trying to figure out why i knew her. i don’t think she even noticed. she had found her lighter and was smoking again, staring off into space, and occasionally shaking her head at the thought of her apathetic co-workers.
Steaming is a cooking technique that seals the food with moist heat and helps to retain their nutrients, flavor, and texture. When you steam fish perfectly, you will get a very tender, silky and slightly chewy texture that is so hale and hearty. Steaming does not require a lot of techniques and skills. You simply have to learn the secret tricks that would turn your plain steamed fish to Chinese-restaurant worthy.
I really love the way my older ones enjoy helping the younger ones, showing them new things, and teaching them. It is such a blessing to watch everyone working together in love!
Day 127 – April 27
Twitter can also warm you up for a busy day. First thing in the morning, it can be difficult to launch straight into your writing. Knock out a few tweets to limber up your fingers and brain. I like to start the day by tweeting nonsense, saying hello to people, checking out the latest sources of excitement and outrage - the virtual equivalent of chatting to folk over breakfast, which is in fact exactly what I’m doing. Get involved, get engaged, warm up... then, crucially, RETREAT and WORK. If you love Twitter as much as I do, then returning to Tweetdeck or your app of choice will feel like a reward to save for later. Or, you know, in five minutes, when you’re not quite ‘feeling it’...
ALEXANDER: No, she didn’t…I got down and started to eat the grass, thinkin’ that might touch her. And she said to me, “you poor man, you must be starvin’. Come around to the back yard an’ I’ll show you were the grass is longer.”
I’m finding that there are SO many little decisions to make about weddings that I’m often on the fence about darn near everything for a little while. This is the case with flowers. I’ve been told time and time again by recent brides that flower costs can really add up. Since we’re trying to keep spending under control, I was super intrigued when I found Rule 42′s Etsy shop.

“You’re going to listen to an anti-abortion protester?”
Canadian courts have never recognized a “political question doctrine.” There is, however, a poorly-defined notion of “justiciability,” which suggests that some questions might not be fit for judicial resolution. The test the Supreme Court has formulated is “whether a sufficient legal component to warrant a decision by a court.” In addition, I believe (though I don’t have room for a demonstration here) that the Court tends to stay its hand in certain cases where political uncertainty makes the relevant facts very difficult to figure out.
I just love the whole atmosphere surrounding darts. As sportsmen (and I refuse to get into that debate as to whether darts is a sport or not, it is, end of!!) the players seem down-to-earth and approachable, unlike some footballers, for example, who seem to carry an air of aloofness around with them that few are anywhere near worthy of. And it was this down-to-earth nature and approachability that made me realise I could quite easily write a novel incorporating my favourite sport and know that the characters would be realistic, that people could identify with them because they're just normal people with a sporting talent.

Another additional contract was the Lime Kiln Drainage located just east of the Bear River Restoration project. This drainage was a steep, narrow, and very rocky area that has a natural spring surfacing that could cause erosion issues along the pipeline. Native shrubs were installed with the goal that planting woody vegetation would dissipate surface water velocities and decrease flow volume further down the drainage. Native plant species on the Lime Kiln revegetation plan included willow species (peachleaf, yellow, booth and sandbar species), four-line honeysuckle, and woods rose.

Every time I hear the name of this brewery, I think of the movie Better Off Dead, from which the quote above comes from. Most of my friends speak in movie quotes, and I'm willing to bet yours do too. Meaning, in the middle of ordinary conversation, instead of just saying our own thoughts, we'll drop in just the right quote from a movie.
I hope I can work some more of the tomatoes in elsewhere, though I'm out of space now in the main garden. Maybe I'll buy some big pots and pot some on the deck. :) The peppers I thankfully have plenty of room for once I harvest our garlic, and the zucchinni I managed to squeeze in 3 right in the spot I'd planned to put 3 of them (thankfully). If I build another small 2 x4 bed in an empty section of the raised bed garden, I might be able to get the rest in. If not, I shall gift those to others, as well.
I was showered with gifts, each one of them so thoughtful and amazing that I couldn't even begin to list them here. My favorite gift? Getting to spend time with my girlfriends/parents and just feeling so completely loved and blessed.

The third full-time job is promoting my work. While writing quality stuff attracts an audience like nothing else can, this is different from the public relations and networking operations that also build and maintain your audience. I fear that using a post to celebrate my Versatile Blogger Award is dangerously like straight PR instead of writing – and it’s PR for other bloggers as much as for me. Is that fair to my readers? Sorry if that rings distastefully to anyone, especially fellow bloggers, but I always try to tell the truth on this blog.

Poynter has a great article that speaks to this issue. The Islamic center they wanted to build near ground zero provided a predicament for many journalists when headlines exploded as ‘Ground Zero Mosque.’ The problem with SEO starts now. Journalists must make a decision whether to be accurate about their reporting or continue to call it a ‘ground zero mosque’ just to bring readers to it and then hoping they read enough of the article to educate themselves on the truth.

In October 2000, top Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin ordered to “intensify the struggle” against Falun Gong overseas, according to a leaked Party document. Since then, adherents of the Falun Gong outside China have seen their tires slashed, their homes vandalized, their e-mail accounts hacked and their phones tapped; they have received death threats, have been beaten and even shot.
I've got some faux blossoming branches in the jar next to my favorite, inexpensive green apples ($1 each) from WalMart. We typically have fresh fruit on hand in the kitchen which always adds a nice splash of color to the room, but here in the entry, I like the pop of color the faux apples add.

We have enjoyed several retro food experiences in our attempt to walk back though the door to times past. One, for example, was at the Angus Steakhouse on the corner of Haymarket, London. This restaurant is the pinnacle of tourist hell (or heaven), no one British would venture there but we found a table because inside it is forever 1972 (as we imagine it). Prawn cocktail, steak and chips with a tomato, peas and a grilled mushroom, profiteroles for pudding and all washed down with furiously sweet Liebfraumilch. On this occasion I wore, to make the evening complete, a particularly beautiful Dior 70′s dinner suit in brown velvet I bought in an Oxfam shop in North Norfolk, a shirt with a ruffle and a purple velvet bow tie. It says something about the tourist nature of the venue than no one batted an eyelid clearly thinking that I was simply wearing what was sophisticated and cool for a night out back home in, say, Yakutsk, Russia or Fairbanks, Alaska (and for all our blog readers in Yakutsk and Fairbanks – sorry).
Table napkins definitely serve a lot of purpose on tables. It’s a good thing that there are a lot of options to choose from. This will allow people to customize it according to the event that they are celebrating. Using it often will also remind people on how they should behave while eating.
I gave my mom and dad a hard time growing up. I was defiant, I thought I knew it all, I made all the wrong choices. I went through dark periods of sadness and confusion. I pushed my family away, I told them I didn't need them. I caused them so much pain that there is nothing I could ever do to make up for it. I loved them, I hated them, I lied, I deceived, I did things I would be ashamed to write here.

since beginning to write this post until this very word there have been 4 police choppers and the sound of non stop sirens. riots. if you planned to come to KL this weekend, well bummer dude. you picked the wrong one. 100,000 so far are protesting through the streets of KL city center. it's called Bersih 3.0. riots, marches, protests coming from the people of Malaysia who want fair and free elections. apparently they don't get violent, but then they say that and last year the police had to use tear gas and water cannons! so I am steering very clear of that fiasco and having some rnr here at home.

The idea that Princess Haiku was a ghost appealed, because of the unlimited freedom of a spirit to travel and explore culture, history, time, place etc. I aspired for Princess Haiku to reflect the collective unconscious, for I wanted her to belong to everyone. In a world rife with conflict, aggression, ideology, hatred and greed, I wanted her to be everything that was beauty, goodness and grace. Art and music are universal languages and they are a good starting point for world peace. It is the task of the people of the world to do what governments cannot; find common human experience that allows for a dialectic of peace.

Hello blogging friends! Is it hard for you to make sympathy cards? Part of me has never liked making sympathy cards, I guess it's just because when we see a sympathy card we know there is sadness and a feeling of great loss for a loved one or a friend. But over the years I have tried to change how I think about creating sympathy cards and yes there is grief but I also try to think of the person who has passed and the beautiful life that they had and all of the lives they have touched along the way and then somehow it seems a little easier.

We guessed at what had happened - his wife had hit him with a frying pan when he came in drunk, he had slipped in the shower or maybe he had continued his drinking when he got home and was just too drunk to go to work and the ER story was just an excuse to keep from being fired. Even though we were short-handed, we thankfully got through the shift without too much trouble. Another day went by and it was time to go to work again. This time, however, the guy was ready to go to work and on the way to the rig, told us why he had missed the previous night.

I found my attitude towards Rousseau becoming more negative as I went through the text; initially, I thought a lot of what he was saying was interesting and relevant to questions about freedom and control – I agreed with his arguments for thinking in terms of ‘contract’, I was interested in what his idea of ‘the general will’.
I liked this better than a lot of the young LDI rye I've had. I appreciate that KBD bottled it at cask strength which is likely what makes it more interesting than many of the more watered down LDI ryes on the market. It's a fun one, at a good price, that's worth a try.

Similarly, Michael Braun, formerly assistant administrator and chief of operations at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), said that the Iran-backed Lebanese group has long been involved in narcotics and human trafficking in South America; however, it is relying on Mexican narcotics syndicates that control access to transit routes into the U.S. Hezbollah relies on "the same criminal weapons smugglers, document traffickers and transportation experts as the drug cartels."
After we set her out (okay, I confess, I did burn rubber just a bit) the Mister and I rode along in silence for thirty minutes. Then, he looked at me and smiled, "Nicest thirty minutes this week!"

He burst out laughing and laughed until tears rolled down his face.

Possibly, I can make the applications, and deal with the distress. Telling myself that I should not be distressed, I should just get on with it, or even that I am not distressed, it is imagined, has got me here. I can deal with the distress cognitively- What is actually happening?- and by feeling and accepting it, and self-caring.

I found Cardstore.com to be very easy to use and was pleased with the large variety of their design selections. They have photo cards for every occasion and event, invitations, thank you cards, birthday cards, everyday cards, encouragement cards, humorous cards, friendship cards, get well cards, sympathy cards, anniversary cards, congratulations cards, moving announcements, wedding cards, graduation cards, flat cards, folded cards, business cards, and even stationary. With all that to choose from I hope you can understand why it took me awhile to peruse thru their website.

I've been hearing alot lately about grilled romaine and have seen it in a few magazines and I thought I'd give it a whirl. Grilled lettuce you say? Grilling this green brings out a beautiful smoky flavor and it's one of the best things I've tasted lately. With a little grated Parmesean it's a perfect recipe to add to the grilling season coming up. Serve it with any pasta - give it a try!

We had a rip roaring good time! You meet so many fascinating people in the ER. Like my first roommate... a sweet little old man who was suicidal. He didn't stay long as he moved on to more luxurious accommodations in the mental ward. Then I was awakened from a lovely doze around 2:30 in the morning by my next roomie, a jolly old soul who sang Christmas carols at the top of his lungs. Sadly, he couldn't remember the words and was the source of a peculiar aroma that came wafting over the curtain that separated us, but why let that spoil a new friendship. Good times, good times!
The Discovery Channel has put out some incredibly bogus, poorly done disinfo presentations such as Inside the Target Car. Any MSM site that features Vincent Bugliosi, Gerald Posner, especially Hugh Aynesworth, Gus Russo, Dale Meyers, Dave Perry or Gary Mack prominently and positively is giving you counterfeit money. If you google “JFK assassination” the first 2 links that come up are lone nutter controlled disinfo sites: 1) Wikipedia 2) John McAdam’s site. John McAdams is a very lowly regarded man who basically controls JFK related content on Wikipedia as well as his own site. Both Wikipedia and the NY Times are both tremendously dishonest sources for information relating to the 1963 Coup d’Etat. Finally, another major source of disinformation on the Coup of 1963 is the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas, which blithely recycles the shredded vapors of the Warren Commission, as if it had an ounce of truth in it. Gary Mack, the curator of the Sixth Floor Museum, simply does not have credibility on the JFK assassination.

It is a 18th Century house, so again, it could provide extra detail for Sovay's home, but that is not why I went there. It houses the National Trust's costume collection. Only a small selection is on display, but I was lucky enough to talk my way behind the scenes and to be shown the kinds of clothes that Sovay and her contemporaries would have been wearing.

Alas I am by myself and sick. I just want to lie down, be taken care of, and watch bad movies while I doze in and out of unconsciousness. I admit it when I am sick I want to be babied. Because usually when I finally succumb to sickness it is because my body refuses to let me do anything else. Still when you are alone lying around isn't an option. I have work I need to get done, and Samshine is coming for a visit, so I suck it up buttercup. I hit the medication…dragged my ass into work…get Sam @7 but by 10 or 11 tonight I am sure I will be a waste. I just hope I have some energy to give to Sam this weekend. I really want to spend some QT with him. I have been missing him a lot lately.

Story: Argyle Jnr, identified by a prominent scar on her back, on the right side of her body, is an amazing mother and I don’t think it has to do with luck either! She has raised seven out of her last seven cubs (including her two current ones) without losing one of them – that is no mean feat in the harshness of the African bush. The most amazing achievement was when she raised all three cubs of her 2008 litter to independence! Firstly having three cubs is not all that common, but to successfully raise a litter of that size is almost unheard of! It was quite a sight seeing her and the three cubs together, especially if they were lying in front of camp during Boma dinner! As a leopard, she is not the most relaxed individual, but is becoming increasingly more relaxed with the vehicles, and is very chilled at night. Her first two known cubs weren’t too relaxed either, but with her second litter, she started relaxing more, and as a result Shongile turned out to be the most relaxed of the youngsters, followed by Vyeboom Dam male. With her 2010 litter, she seems to be spending a bit more time in the Timbavati, and the increased frequency of sightings is allowing her and the two cubs to become more accustomed to the Land Rovers, and they are slowly providing better viewing.

This is a recreation of Restwell Keep done using the tactical maps from A Season of Serpents. The map is not perfect, and the most glaring change is that the bank has switched sides from the southern wall to be adjacent to the keep. There are plenty of minor differences as well, such as the complete lack of an inner bailey, but to throw down this almost 300′ wide town is still pretty impressive. It also makes a congruent town shape, where the outer edges become the outer stone walls. With the addition of some dungeon tiles, even more possibilities open up.

Now many women are concerned about ‘spillage’. The rule of thumb is this, your gusset cups should not cover much more than the lower half/hemisphere of your breasts. The nipple should be just barely covered by the edge of your binding, or even half-covered. The top half of your breasts should be pillowed in the cups. What keeps them from falling out is the neckline of your shift. The shift is an essential partner in the team that is your Regency underpinnings, and it acts like the top half of your bra.

This interesting animal resembles a short, fairly thickset Australian dingo with a broad vulpine face and varying coat colour (most commonly brown), but with a noticeably bushy tail that it sometimes curls to one side over its rump. It also compares closely with the dingo in relation to certain cranial-dental ratios held to be of significance in canid classification. Recent genetic research has revealed that both singing dog and dingo date back at least 4000 years, making them among the oldest of the ancient domestic dog breeds.
This, the middle section of the novel, is why THE BERLIN CROSSING is being pitched in certain quarters as a thriller of the Le Carré variety, but I think it will become quickly obvious to any fan of the classic spy thrillers that that’s not the kind of novel Brophy had in mind. Certainly, he seems more than happy to play with the tropes and conventions of the spy novel - the secret service ‘spooks’ in London recruiting unwilling spies via blackmail; the East Berlin setting; the secretive missions, false identities and ‘dead letter’ drops; the sense of claustrophobia and paranoia - but any fan of Le Carré, Ambler et al will be underwhelmed by THE BERLIN CROSSING as a spy novel.
Though Shimla has pleasant climate throughout the year, it experiences very cold winters. The temperatures can drop to sub-zero conditions during the peak winter season. So for our readers who still would like to know a specific good time to visit Shimla, it would be October to November and from March to May. It is advisable not to visit Shimla during monsoons as the place has a history of having landslides every now and then. The roads can get very slippery and it is not a good idea to roam around at this time. Do take this advice seriously.

While I have been here I have had to make the most of indoor gardening. Being on the top floor, our balcony receives all-day incredibly strong sun; not the best for most plants, something I realized after systematically killing 3 basil plants last summer. (I harvested 85% of those plants before they died, so I don’t consider their deaths a total loss, though!)

Okay, so, today post is exactly what the titles says.
I still think that The Hunger Gameshas the potential to be the next literary touchstone. Given the popularity of the first film, the books are going to be read more now than ever. Unfortunately, it will have to overcome the movie, because the movie (as good as it was, and it was very good), through no fault of its own, casts the viewers in the role of the elite. It’s hard to identify with a poor girl from District 12 when you’re living in the Capitol.

Enthused by the idea that the building has a history within the Chatsworth Road community, Alvarado says: “We have met a lot of people who used to come here. It’s part of the high street. There was a man talking about it yesterday and he was like ‘trust me – it was Pain at the Dentist’.”
An encyclopedic study of the entire whisky world is an awesome task. Dave Broom is one of the two or three people equipped to write this sort of tome, but what struck me as I read it it was how he had marshaled such a huge amount of factual material and yet maintained a light lyricism in his writing. It is like bagging all the Munros wearing carpet slippers.

She got the greatest epidural ever, feeling no pain, and there was a moment just before she came out when we were just waiting for a contraction. The OB was fiddling with something and we asked what it was. She said she was playing with the baby’s hair and I laughed, but my ex did not believer her, so I held the camera down there and took a quick shot of what was going on. end of story.

But Lanza goes further than to suggest that there are different versions of reality. He argues that there are as many realities as there are observers, and that without observers there is no reality at all. In the cited article, he approvingly quotes Nils Bohr: ”When we measure something we are forcing an undetermined, undefined world to assume an experimental value. We are not ‘measuring’ the world, we are creating it.”

Ideally I'd have a room like this all to myself. OK, in my most fantastic dreams I'd have a room, even a tiny one, with a view of the sea. There's something about the ocean that seems to inspire my creative side. But I'm not complaining - not for a minute! I'm thrilled with the place I've got. Hm, except for the lack of bookshelves. I have to go to other rooms for my book collection if I want to refer to something other than the thesaurus on my desk. Oh, it's a hard life!

Every time I’ve walked around the house over the last few weeks I start getting a little hive-y about the number of projects I need to address. Now I’m not a fussy one when it comes to entertaining – I had all my girlfriends over last fall with a torn up kitchen floor and powder room and lived to tell the tale.
Editor’s Note
This project consisted of going to several different trailers in Southern Louisiana and doing small but necessary home improvements. I learned how to install chicken wire along the bottom of a trailer ("to keep the critters out" we were told). Learned how to install linoleum. We also painted the entire interior of several trailers. And on one fateful afternoon, I spent the entire day putting this white gooey stuff in all the cracks in the window frames and door frames. It was fun, but messy. I'm not sure if you've heard of it before - but it's called caulk. Of course when I heard it for the first time, I heard "cock".

At first I was completely taken with Winter’s writing; she certainly has a gift for pulling you into a story that makes you feel very unsettled, but at the same time compelled to keep reading. I was so intrigued by this helpless baby born with both female and male reproductive organs, and the decisions forced upon its parents; do they bring it up as a boy or a girl? Or do they leave it, being both male and female, letting it be as it was born to be. I feel slightly cruel using the word ‘it’ to describe a person here, but I’m not entirely sure what other word to use, so I hope it doesn’t offend anyone! The baby is soon named Wayne, a decision made by his father, Treadway, because of his longing for a son; someone to teach how to hunt in the wilderness of Canada, someone he can sculpt into a man; a provider. But Wayne’s mother, Jacinta, feels very early on that Wayne isn’t simply a boy, and she finds it unbearable to have to suppress Wayne’s female side. She wants him to live exactly as he is, and not be forced either way. However, perhaps the biggest influence onWayne’s life is Jacinta’s friend, Thomasina; who recently lost both her husband and daughter in an accident. Her daughter’s name was Annabel, and it is by this name that she chooses to talk toWayne. It is through Thomasina that Wayne’s female side is allowed to grow, and this has some devastating consequences for all involved.

So when the suggestion was made that someone needed to write about a Middle Eastern superhero my imagination went into overdrive. Of course we need a Middle Eastern superhero! Others have tackled this topic to great success, like Dr. Naif of the99.org, what’s different here is that I am not from the Middle East.
Hardly a day goes by that we aren’t made aware of this heartbreaking reality. It is so acute we now have not one but six new television series dedicated to men’s social demotion. In these programs, husbands are made to look like fools — while the wives wield a power so ugly it’s no wonder marriage has become so elusive. The modern generation has been sold a bill of goods about human nature, and the result is that men now have no idea how to be men. Why? Because women won’t let them.
See, it doesn’t matter what side of the aisle you hail from. If an incumbent's constituents are the least bit unsettled the signs are saying that the bar is much lower than normal to bounce them from office. What I don't see is a mandate for Democrats to re-take power, nor an “all-clear” signal for Republicans that a significant slice of the electorate is still in their camp. The electorate as a whole is very dissatisfied, and if you appear to be part of the problem, regardless of party, you are in deep doo-doo.

The main lesson from the Fukushima nuclear disaster is that the significant failure of the institutions that were supposed to protect people from such an accident in fact enabled it. Years before the disaster, the risks of earthquakes and tsunamis were well known. Yet, the nuclear industry and its regulators chose to ignore the dangers.

We have a glorious day here, I do hope you have one where you are too. My card today is for several challenges and I decided to go for an almost WOW scheme. I've followed the sketch from Sketch Saturday which was lovely to work with. My bp is a pearlescent white which I put through an embossing folder. I used a lace stamp embossed with guilded ivory ep although the real effect is very difficult to see in the photo - and we just won't talk about how many photos I took trying to get a half decent one. I've used double strips of white sparkly peel offs instead of some of the layers. Some punched flowers that I've added pearls to the centre of finish the background. The image is a combination of digi stamps I've added irises and daffodils to the fabulous basket from Shelley's Images that is one of the images for round #14 of the Progressive challenge at CDAC this time. I coloured all of them digitally. I had a very clear idea of how I wanted this card to look from the start but had a few false starts before it finally came together, but I'm happy with the end result.

This might not be the most authentic fudge, but hey, it has THREE ingredients and tastes amazing, so I don't really care. You could sub some hazelnut-chocolate spread for 1/3 of the peanut butter if you want to and garnish with what ever floats your boat. I did, and topped with chopped peanuts. This is best stored in the fridge.

One of the big things I worked on with my kids was being able to go out in public and behave appropriately. I would take them to places like the movie theater, out to eat in restaurants, to the store, etc. More times than not these outings went well, but sometimes they did not. In a way, this was good. I wanted the kids to have whatever challenges they were going to have with me so that I could shape their behavior and help them be able to tolerate and, hopefully, enjoy the outings so that they could participate with their families. This meant that I had to deal with the behaviors head on rather than escaping from the public environment as fast as I could. That was not always easy.

Well, I had a few hiccups with this one...1/2 the mussels didn't open, my sauce split and it wasn't as thick as I would have liked. However, the dish was very tasty and I would definitely try it again. Next time, I will make sure my butter has melted properly before adding the wine and turn up the heat so the mussels cook faster. I learned later that they only take about 3 mins to cook.

At 23, Stafford has had one of the best – if not the best – seasons by a Lions quarterback ever. This year, he has thrown for a franchise single-season record of 4,518 yards (he surpassed Scott Mitchell’s total of 4,338 from the 1995 season in Saturday’s win over San Diego). Stafford’s 36 touchdowns this year also are a single-season franchise record. He even has a 63.7 completion percentage, which also is one of the best marks for a Lions quarterback that has started 75 percent of the team’s games.

Not much is known about my great-grandfather, only that he was a drunken and rambunctious buffoon who constantly fought with his wife and eventually cut ties with his family. My grandfather was also a drunkard who cheated on and possibly abused his wife. He killed himself and his best friend in a drunken automobile accident on the way to his mistress’s house only four months before his son was born. My father (named after both men killed in the accident) was in turn born with the Curse and passed it on to me, his only son.

It should be noted the 1996 cost estimates contained in this report are much lower than the 1995 estimates for reasons explained in Vol. 1, Sec. 5.3. In fact, the prime emphasis of this report is the often fluctuating costs of the environmental management program, and not the variety or amounts of the contamination being remediated. Assumed remedial strategies for a variety of remediation scenarios are listed in Vol. 1, Table 6.2, pg. 6.8. “This analysis does not account for any costs incurred by the civilian radioactive waste management program.” (Vol. 1, pg. 6-20).

My rating might confuse you a little considering I have not really said many positive things about this movie. But here’s the fact: whether you like this movie or not definitely depends on where you see it and with whom. If you watch this in a multiplex, you might want to find Sajid and strangle him. But if you watch this a theater with the ‘mass’ crowd with a group of friends – like I did – after a stressful day, you might end up enjoying this brainless caper.

Adoption creates complex emotions bcause adoption itself is complex, forming out of complex situations.

It's always far more complex than we realize.
Today was just one of those days that I have to stop and take a moment to show my gratitude. It wasn’t any one thing that made the day so fantastic (although a few of these things were awesome all on their own!), but it was the combination of all of them that made it simply amazing.

Alex Jones talks with Douglas J. Hagmann, founder and director of the Northeast Intelligence Network. He is also the CEO of a private investigative agency serving a roster of Fortune 500 clients. Due to his expertise in covert surveillance and counter-terrorism, Mr. Hagmann has been used as an operational asset by the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, as well as the Pennsylvania and New York State Police agencies. Earlier this month, Doug said high-level, reliable sources told him the Department of Homeland Security is preparing for a “massive civil war” in America as a result of a collapse of the dollar and the hyperinflation that will result.

There are a couple of other issues addressed at this page, but those above listed in 1 through 4 are those that keep getting new life through the work of paid anti-nuclear activists, often funded by 'environmental' non-profit organizations. Further ridiculous hyperbole about the supposed ability of materials at the site to cover the earth in event of specified or yet unspecified further imaginary disaster is sheer rubbish - if events such as the rougly 10 megaton Ivy Mike shot and the 15 megaton Castle Bravo shot set off during the years of atmospheric nuclear weapons tests didn't spread "nuclear death" all over the planet (and neither did the numerous other multi-megaton shots we set off - and the Soviet Union set off) then nothing that can occur at Fukushima Daiichi can do that either. It hasn't and it won't.

The other family was everywhere in there, so I shut the door and went down again and said I wanted to go to bed. Actually I didn't want to go to bed at all, but I thought it would be best. Then I wouldn't have to say anything. The bed was as wide and desolate as the landscape outside. The eiderdown was like a hand, too.

Extra geek points for me!) out of the dangerous city into a just as dangerous suburban area in order to survive. If you don’t remember, or this is the first time reading about my plotline…here’s the basics.

I love Italian food. My love of Italian food goes beyond pizza and spaghetti. I have a longing to learn how to cook Italian food from the different regions of Italy. I recently discovered Lida's cooking show on my local PBS cable channel. I like her format of sharing recipes from Italy, which are intermingled with beautiful videos of her visiting the region from where her recipe originates. I was intrigued by her episode on Sardinia, and then I watched her making a very simple pasta with two of her grandchildren! Lidia explained each step so well, that she made it look so simple--so I decided I was going to make this delicious looking dish. Unfortunately, I don't have any of her cookbooks (which is going to change), and this recipe was not posted on her website. The sausage tomato sauce is very similar to how I make marinara sauce, so that was easy to "wing" on my own. As for the pasta-- I had to rewind her show (I love DVR), pausing and trying to see the measurements on camera. I ended up guessing at the amount of water she used to make this very simple semolina flour "gnocchi". Let me show you:

If you have a tendency to skim over extended quotes – as I do – let me re-emphasize part of Fiona’s letter. She said, “…goodness has nothing to do with sexual orientation.

There is no suggestion that MI5 were involved directly in the torture of Binyam Mohamed. Complicity is the issue. The Independent notes:“The mistreatment took part in Pakistan while the Ethiopian-born Mr Mohamed was in custody of US authorities. It is unclear whether this was done by Americans or by agents of the ISI, the Pakistani secret police, which has itself been accused of helping to organise attacks by Islamist terrorist groups in a number of countries in pursuit of its own shadowy agenda.There are no claims that MI5 took part in the abuse. But one of its agents, “Witness B” in court proceedings, “probably” knew of it in documents he read before flying out to interrogate Mr Mohamed.”
I agree with the DBJ assessment of removing the core… but I agree because the core forwards are not very good at contributing to offense. Of the forwards that remained at the end of the season on the Columbus Blue Jackets, only one has a career points per game over 0.80, and that’s Rick Nash. Only two are above 0.60 points per game over their career (Nash and Prospal) and neither is overwhelmingly dominant enough to make up for the lack of other skilled players. The core needs to go because, quite simply, the core is not effective. They need to be replaced with skill. The focus should not be on resigning Dorsett and Boll. Winning is learned when the team has enough skill to win games. Character can wait until that happens.
These words were not easy. On July 25, L. wrote to me: Although I know you do not feel connected to your sadness, rest assure, you are at a kind of magical stage of subconscious connection. She is speaking through your heart, mind and pen (or rather, your laptop). Sadness will roll in with the tides of mundane memories, with holidays, with realizations about the lack of phone calls. Unfortunately, it will eventually come. But for now, know that the unexpected thing about loss is a strange super-powered infusion of love that you gain from the person that you lost. It is almost like a shield that they give us for our hearts. And that shield is made up of the energy created by the POWER of your connection to them. Some may call it denial or shock, but really, I think it is the protection given from our beloved, the one who knows that our fragile hearts can only take so much at a time... Lest they break in two. And that is the last thing that they would ever want to happen. In the beginning, my grief was a conduit. I did not need to fight to speak to you, which was for the best - I am no fighter. I have lived with my grief through summer, fall, winter and an early, early spring (earlier still than last year:We are home from Paris, where June's sun visited in April forcing the sleepy cherry blossoms into wide-eyed morning, before, even their siblings have risen in Japan.) I know this feeling of grief like my eyelids on a summer's day, and yet I still feel so very unsure of what will be there when I open my eyes.

Realizing that their days as relatively attractive women with all their limbs are numbered, Anna and Rosette try to get a revolt going. Only problem being all their bunkmate's are all showing the signs of having resided at a concentration camp where medical experiments and gang rape are not only commonplace, they're in the brochure. (Medical Camp #9: "Come for the syphilis, stay for the sexual humiliation."). In other, less offensive words, they've been there way too long to be any sort of shape to help.
We received evidence that the secret army had actually existed, at least until the beginning of the 90s. And still there is no reason to believe it was dismissed. Can you add some important details to the above-mentioned?

But for the ones still on the loose, it’s a whole other problem. All we really know is that there’s at least one more of them (strictly speaking, there’s probably at least TWO more of them, seeing as how the Twilights keep talking about the Old GODS rather than the Old GOD, or just plain That Dude N’Zoth), and that they’re located, well, DOWN THERE somewhere. Hell, one of them could be tucked away somewhere under Orgrimmar for all we know. I guess the Titans supposedly imprisoned them all underground, although, first of all, Titans, nice job letting the rest of us know where they ARE so we could maybe help keep an eye on them, or at least not go digging around too close and maybe accidentally let them loose delving too greedily and too deep, and second of all, bang-up job keeping the three we know about contained all air-tight like they have been. Hell, one of those three is STILL contained as far as we know, and it hasn’t stopped him (her? it? they? do we need to invent a whole new pronoun for these things?) from stirring up all kinds of trouble with Deathwing and Ragnaros and the Twilights.

I hear a loud thud. Then crying. Great, they really are trying to kill each other. I can tell from the crying that the injury is probably not life threatening. I don’t dare get up to check on them until this call is over. I would hate for the person on the other end to know that I have monsters in my house. They probably don’t have monsters in their house. I’m pretty sure this is a freak thing that no other parent has ever experienced. No? Still, it’s not exactly what you want to hear on the other end of a phone while you’re trying to do business.

For the longest time, I wanted to camp out in the backcountry of the Everglades. These “primitive” campsites, are far from the electricity and amenities that the front country sites offer.

I took a short drive out to Lisle, IL this past weekend to check out the annual Midwest Distance Gala at Benedictine University. It is at an amazing facility for this type of event. Great track, green surroundings, great seating, etc. The announcer was excellent, on top of his game keeping everyone updated on who was who. After listening to Carol Lewis announce Track and Field all season it was a pleasure.
Gladys felt as if someone had just kicked her in the stomach. She stank? She stunk? What did he mean? Did he mean she smelt bad or that she had girl cooties? She was heartbroken. The whole class giggled then they laughed harder. Gladys smiled as best she could and tried to act like it was a big joke so she replied “Oh yeah, Brad, well you smell like boy cooties!” Mrs. Perkins put her hand on Gladys shoulder and gave her the teacher silent code for sit down. Gladys sat and turned the card over and over in her hand. Then it hit her. He had HER card. Oh NO! There was no way to get it back. What if he opened it and read it in front of the class now? What was she going to do?
While asking for a new interface, I should note that some limited customization is welcomed. The screen must look similar for all Wii U owners, but allow options to categorize and personalize downloaded games and applications. The Nintendo 3DS recently gained the ability to add and manage folders on the HOME menu. This reduced the clutter of all twenty ambassador games, as well as any eShop downloads. This is the type of thinking that should be used for the Wii U’s new interface.
One teacher that I spoke to and asked about his thoughts on the vote of no confidence responded saying, “I ask myself a simple question: has my job gotten easier or harder while he has been the superintendent and have kids benefited or been harmed as a result of his policies and leadership?” Given that, according to this teacher, the answer to the former question was no and the latter was that students have been harmed, his choice in the upcoming vote became clear.

So, are there diets that I haven't tried? Sure! I'm too poor to attempt Nutrisystem and Jenny Craig. I know people who have and have been successful on it ... until faced with the reality of rejoining a society where you can't walk into any restaurant and order a Jenny Craig/Nutrisystem meal off the menu. For me Weight Watchers is the logical choice. I like to eat. Scratch that last statement. I LOVE to eat, and I don't like being told not to have certain things. It makes me want them even more. This weight loss thing isn't hard to figure out — moderation and exercise. So if it's so simple, why can't it be so easily conquered? This isn't a rhetorical question; I really want to know!

From the patient’s point of view, the plication offers some significant benefits: faster, more intense weight loss in a laparoscopic procedure, and no device maintenance. With LAP-BAND, the faster the patient loses, the more often the band must be ‘filled’ (via a port in the stomach) so the patient continues to feel the restriction.

My parents worked incredibly hard to turn 5 acres of dirt into a wonderful family home. For over 20 years they landscaped the gardens and turned it into a beautiful place full of serenity. A lot of my childhood was spent helping them. We’d pick up rocks (oh the rocks) to make long rambling rock walls. We’d help make garden beds, trim trees, wheel dirt from here to there. At the time I didn’t see the sense in it but when they sold it only 5 years ago, they left behind not just a house but a magic place full of wonderful memories….and thousands of rocks.

But if your words are going to have substantial impact on your readers, or your business, or your reputation, or that of someone else, you want to make sure they have the right impact, the proper weight, a sharp focus. In such a case, using the appropriate words will be important, as will sentence structure, and length, and building in context. No matter how skilled a writer you are, you should consider what an editor can do for your work.

It’s just all kind of tedious to sit through. REPO clunks and chunks its way forward, introducing a string of seemingly endless subplots, but it’s the historical interludes that reveal the history between Nathan and Rotti that are the most interesting. In the past, there’s some semblance of hope in this dystopian world and a sense that things that are happening are caused by the very real emotions of love and rejection, but here in the present it’s all so depressing and, worse, so desperate to be cool by being dark and gory and singing that any real motivation gets lost behind noxious guitars and silly make-up.
I was looking through some old college pictures today and I came across this one from our sophomore year. Not only is Anna wearing her signature smile, but the angel wings made me burst into tears all over again. If anyone in this world deserves to be an angel...its Anna.

The Pilot had an early trip out on Saturday morning so he missed Christmas with my family. We celebrated Noche Buena with roast pork, rice and beans, mashed yuca, guayaba pasteles and rum punch. And because roast pork only comes once a year, this vegetarian of 5 years digged in and had a little bit of the Christmas pig. After dinner, we opened presents.

The world population, the totality of all living humans on the planet Earth, as of today, is estimated to 6 or 7 billion people and everyone is their own person that has their own beliefs and as long as they are not intentionally hurting somebody they have a right to their own beliefs, ideas, life styles and such. Why do you have the need to force your opinion’s on to others? Ask yourself that. Life is very diverse and can you not respect that you have a problem and that problem is within yourself, no one else is the problem. If you do not love yourself enough to be happy (yes, happiness is a choice) then at least realize this and stay the hell away with your depressing self cause you are only making yourself seem stupid.

I have since searched it out locally and have gone through two jars already. It's great on ribs, pork chops, and steaks too. In fact the last night in Topsail we treated ourselves to a massive grilled beef rib roast, again with the Famous Daves rub, and it was another "best I've ever had" moment. Like I said I'm not a paid shill nor am I employed by Famous Daves, but I give this stuff my five star recommendation. Give it a try and let me know what you think.

I read this book as soon as it came out in paperback, as a sophomore in college, and it changed my life forever. Paranoia moved in and never left. Before Communion there was nothing available in the local bookstores of NJ or upstate NY dealing with alien realities and no internet to order obscure titles. Streiber popularized the phenomena by getting his book into our only suburban options, B. Dalton and Waldenbooks. He brought the dialogue into the popular consciousness. And best of all, since he is a fiction writer first and an abductee second. He brought real acumen to the 'fictional' or cover memory aspect of the experience that few have been able to bring since. While some abductees say that the greys are living breathing beings, Streiber's always felt they were more robotic, insectoid puppets usually controlled by some taller single being; the rest appear as toys, goblins, balloons, masks within masks.

The construction of the tower was complex because of the very poor ground conditions on the site. The foundations were based on a sunken concrete cassion that was built above ground then sunk over a period of time. Cassion foundations are often found in harbour construction; to find this foundation being used in the 1960s for a local authority tower block was a first, the cassion below the tower was put to use as an underground garage area for residents. The tower itself has a very bold and striking appearance, unlike any other tower block or high rise building in the UK. Derwent Tower is of a Brutalist design and retains lots of design similarities with the Gatesheads "Get Carter car park" also a product of the Owen Luder Partnership. The building houses two-bedroom flats up to the 10th floor, 1 bedroom flats from floor 11 to 29.
5: I did a lot of research into which carriers were best for a mobile toddler, and the advice came down to two choices: a ring-sling and a soft-structured carrier. I loved the look of a ring-sling, and fellow mums advised me that it was the best choice for a toddler, being easy to slip them in and out. So I bought an Ellaroo lightly padded ring-sling brand new. It was the cheapest of all the slings I’ve owned, and by far the most beautiful.

I tend to keep the "big important secrets" under wraps for a while, just to make sure they don't fall through before speaking publicly about them. But because I've found so few women who are willing to share their journey, failures and successes, with a small business, I wanted to try and speak about mine. We've been looking at brick and mortar spaces the past little while. A few "oh we're interested in hearing more" phone calls made, and a much more serious one as of late. We found a space... nearby our home and a great size for starting out. The price and situation seem great, too. The only thing we're not sure of: the location is ~eh, even though it has 30,000 cars passing by daily (!!!), and the "Are we ready?!" freak out. I thought by having Honeybean it'd help satisfy the need for a storefront. It'd give us a few years to get things ready and to plan... but it's done the exact opposite. It's made me realize how much I loved owning my own business and it makes me eager to move on to bigger and better things (all the while keeping the 'bean of course!)

Ms Sand and Sunshine has decided to sew some of her quilt centre together today. It's going to look fabulous I think.

The quaint town of Ubud is made famous by Elizabeth Gilbert’s memoir, “Eat Pray Love”. Its streets are filled with women who seemed to have jumped right out of the pages of the book, single middle-aged, presumably divorced such as Gilbert, cycling around till the wee hours of the morning, in cascading dresses waiting for their soul mates around the corner, almost as if Bali held the entire world’s other half.

There’s awkwardness at first since they are both mad at each other but soon enough, Yi Gak does what every kdrama male lead does in this situation – he gets mean. Well, mean in that cute way we are supposed to find romantic.
This all started when Princess Birgitta borrowed the Cameo Tiara from her mother, Princess Sibylla for her wedding day. Actually, she had a two-tiara affair: she wore this for her civil ceremony, and a tiara from her husband's family (the Hohenzollerns) for the religious wedding. It's a bit of an unusual wedding pick, due to its interesting form and color, but it is one of the most historically significant pieces the Swedish house owns. Her sister Princess Désirée followed in her footsteps, but their other two sisters chose different headpieces. The strength of this budding tradition, in my opinion, comes from their sister-in-law Queen Silvia, and her decision to wear this on her wedding day. We've now seen it on Crown Princess Victoria, and it's a safe bet that we'll see it on Princess Madeleine some day.

But anyway. These communities have created their OWN public distribution system. It's truly amazing. They have seed banks (all run by illiterate dalit women) and they give seeds to farmers to grow these local crops. The only condition is that they have to bring back twice as many seeds the next year, so the seed banks keep growing. It's just really great. I can't do it justice. And these community distribution systems are currently supporting around 50,000 families in this region. It's sooooo aaaaaweeessssooommmmmmmeeeeeee.

Odd is the assertion that fakes are under attack because local brands such as Lenovo and Haier have a greater interest in preventing piracy. I say "odd" because no support is brought to support the claim. There is no evidence that Lenovo and Haier, as examples, are active in this regard in China, nor any proof that attitudes by such companies redound to changed views about fakes by the consumer public. In the world of nuance and context, the tagline--"Chinese consumers fall out of love with fakes"--more accurately yields the following:

Laying there in bed I finally succumbed to these feelings that had been plaguing me all week and I had a good cry. My poor husband didn't know what to do with me, but thankfully he just hugged me and reminded me of how beautiful he thinks I am and reminded me of all the fun things we are going to do this summer that will make time just whiz by. I was not wishing away the pregnancy, but wishing away the time and he reminded me that these next few weeks are going to be awesome and that I really didn't want to do that.

If I believe that the Bible is not telling me the truth about God, about Creation, about Redemption, then I will live like that. I will likely care nothing for God. I may not commit murder or rape, but I will likely live without regard to what God has said about Creation, Redemption, God, Jesus Christ, Sin, and the like. In other words, I will live without regard for God, I will reject him, I will ignore him, I will blaspheme, ridicule, and mock him. I can personally think of nothing more offensive than to disregard God, and ignore or ridicule the work He accomplished through Jesus Christ at the cross. If God did not create, then just exactly how am I accountable to God? But if God did create, then I am wholly accountable to Him.
Maybe it makes me feel better to pretend that there isn't evil in the world but I'm lying to myself.

2. Esthero –I Drive Alone (This song starts out “Can’t move on but I can’t go home,” which I think speaks true to places we get “stuck” in from time to time – especially with love. I used to listen to this song a lot when I was single, and the fact that I was driving alone listening to a song called “I Drive Alone” gave me an immediate calm. I think it’s so important to spend time with yourself before you get into serious relationships – to make sure you know what you really want, not what you’re taught to want. We’re always in such a rush for love (especially when we’re young). Enjoy being alone. It is such a gift.)
- On a related note, I've had SO. VERY. MANY. THOUGHTS. swirling around in my brain recently and all that I can think is that I wish I had the time/means to just sit and write them out. One of the best things anyone has ever said to me was my therapist in college telling me that she felt like I was pretty good at working things out on my own and that she merely served as a sounding board for me to organize my thoughts. I do seem to have an innate ability to remove myself from almost every situation and look at it rationally from other points of view; the problem is that I end up with so many varied perspectives that I get overwhelmed with the possible resolutions. There are a select few very close friends who can handle hearing me out without thinking I'm a total lunatic, but let's be real, not many of them have the hours of time it takes to just listen to me talk it out. In the absence of a professional being paid to do just that, I've found that writing it out serves as a passable substitute. I just never have the time to actually do it!
The signs convey the same basic message, one that shopkeepers have made use of for awhile: the simple "thank you, come again." They're obviously mass-produced, but how do local grocers acquire them? I asked around and found out that the green signs are provided by Chase, and the red ones by Western Union. However, they aren't just giveaways: Chase and Western Union purchase the space on walls and doors, and replace the signs at their leisure. The store owners get a monthly payment for renting the space.

So back to the point of my story. Sorry I get side-tracked very easily. I was talking to this guy on the phone earlier this morning that works for Monster...you know the job posting website. We basically have a contract with them that they will run our job posting ad for the next year but when I got our invoice in the mail we were charged tax. We have forms in order to be tax free so we had to chat about this.
So, free speech to Dagsavisen means that they can publish accusations that I inspire mass murder, that I am just like Nazi criminals who were responsible for organizing genocide, and that I represent a plague epidemic of delusional people whose paranoia is like toxic waste to society. Yet they refuse to publish a short reply by me.

Not long ago I was sent the Sophyto Daily Skin Essentials Collection to test out. I decided to try it and also have a friend try it too, so we switched off on what products each of us were using. This collection contains five deluxe sized products great for everyday use.
So that’s how I’ve gotten into the habit of stooping down to pick up debris. If I’m doing it often enough that people who witness the act think I’m just being a conscientious employee concerned about the appearance of the office, then they won’t be suspicious if they happen to notice the tile comet sliding down my ankle. Only once has anyone commented on the emergent hat, and I was able to laugh that off by claiming it was a dryer sheet.

b. Change of clothes for you. Spit up is not only incredibly gross for you to smell, other people can smell it too. Stop the random gagging and change your shirt. Plus it can and will ruin the just-out-of-the-shower-last-week look you’ve got going on. Just trust me and bring a change for you – you’ll probably use it first.
Believe it. It is real. But only for a season.

The other plus is my giveaway prize arrived this morning! My friend Jona had a giveaway on her blog not long ago and I won! (FYI you should read her blog if you aren’t already) I’ll be doing a better write up on the products I won when I feel better. But I tried the shampoo and conditioner when I tried to wash the ick away and they are amazing. I also have to say the color infused lip gloss is a new favorite. But more on that after many naps.

This time, I went on a lot of rides I had not been on during my previous trips to Disneyland as well. Roller coasters. I have been scared to death of them since forever. and for some bizarre reason, I went on many of them this time. Including my first roller coaster that goes upside down. (I kept imagining I would drop something and then catch it on the way down. My understanding of physics is amazing, I know.) The weirdest part is that I wasn’t screaming half the time, I was laughing hysterically. For no reason. It’s like I was just laughing to distract myself from the thoughts of “I’mgonnadieI’mgonnadieI’mgonnadieI’mgonnadie…” Laughter is just naturally my automatic defense mechanism. Even when it comes to something physical. (Yes. I will be laughing at the guy that is stabbing me.)
Against my better judgement, I started planting the southwest border, despite the disaster with the sheet mulching this spring. I need to get all these seedlings in before the cold of autumn.
Indeed, I can’t even think of an obvious reason for why this is happening (although as always there are a number of possible factors; some serious, some really not).”
Every once in a while I sit back and review how I got here from there… It never ceases to amaze me how many people have shared and are sharing my path. These people wear many disguises, and have been physically, spiritually and even metaphorically a part of my life and who I am…

Some get severe sugar and caffeine cravings in a desperate attempt to give the body some kind of energy boost, while others lose their appetite completely.
Suddenly, from the living room, there came the most bloodcurdling yowl, and then Q'Tesh came streaking into the bedroom, fur standing on end, ears flat to the head, eyes wild, and a pair of my super fuzzy soft socks in her mouth, with a stance that said she had captured the Holy Grail of Kittendom, and woe unto anyone foolish enough to approach her! Of course, that meant that Valla the little kitten was hard on her heels. She got to close and got a nasty, no-nonsense, smack from Q who then made a "GGGRRRRUMUMUMUMUMUMum-mum-mum-mum!" noise. I was hysterical. I wish I had a way of recording the sound. This continued for a while, flying all over the house, knocking over lamps, tumbling the freshly folded laundry, and sending various household items flying. It was enough insanity that the 2 old girls actually got up, and joined the fray. Great. Now I have one psychotic kitten being pursued by 1 determined kitten and 2 extremely wily old cats, who kept mounting ambush attacks. At one point I tried to take the socks away, and got slashed for my efforts. That is waaaaay out of character for her.

Look, I’m not buying that the atheists’ altruistic self-professed pursuit of reason is what undergirds their conclusion that God does not exist; I believe it’s because they want to believe that they’ll never be called into eternal accountability for their temporal actions by a holy God. Talk about an opiate for the masses!

First, let me explain what is not wrong with the endings. The lack of denouement is not a weakness or a problem. We do not need it. They're not really a part of the overarching issues that the ending is trying to tackle. This is an artistic decision that is designed to put focus on the broader, more complex issues. If we get to see each character's resolution, our attention is drawn away from the difficult discourse regarding evolution, survival, and dialectic. Indeed, the brevity of the resolution is actually one of the things that the design team did right. This, however, needed to be tempered by a sense of payoff for the player. A longer, more complex and challenging climax would offset a lot of player frustration with the ending.

Loving the other and Universal Love are wonderful values. But unless they are steeped in an understanding of loving (and protecting) our own first, and that this is a fundamental law of nature, we risk losing not just our identity, but as Jews, our very being.

It just downright sucked. Well April didn’t suck, I sucked. -_-. April was decent. Weather could’ve been a little nicer in my opinion.

Besides these two outfield prospects, the Memphis Redbirds have Amaury Cazana, Chris Swauger and Cedric Hunter listed as outfielders, all of whom have less than a .300 average thus far through 24 games in the 2012 season.

I am happy to say that Jackson is cancer free today, and in the maintenance phase of his treatment plan at CHOP. It was a rocky 7 months but Jackson has turned out to be THE strongest person I have ever known.

Like everyone who watched, read and partook in the screening of the ‘Singhvi Sexcapade’ drama, I too am inclined to give my verdict. There is a tweet i found striking. Will go by the same, support it and declare my verdict: Singhvi is guilty!!
So we try to first think about God. The Holy Spirit is amazing; he will lead people who are following him to help build community. It’s possible to have an explosive, movement-oriented church that has unbelievable down-deep community. And if I had a blueprint for that right now, I would be writing a book.

What I like: Everything in the Looking for the Perfect Gift? catalogue directly supports the spread of the gospel. So most of the gifts in the CMS catalogue are focussed on supporting and equipping missionaries, pastors, students or families to carry out the work of the gospel across the globe. This is a great thing as people definitely need to hear the gospel, and this gift can have widespread effect on the community as they hear and receive the gospel.

First, Is there really a need for things like this? I mean, I know this guy is probably just a smarmy huckster, but I’m sure some women will avail themselves of his service.

“In Medina, Muhammad displayed impressive leadership skills,” the textbook asserts. “He fashioned an agreement that joined his own people with the Arabs and Jews of Medina as a single community.

God loves the whole world; so should we. Jesus died for the whole world, not just for our nation or our kind of people. As the body of Christ in the world today, He has left to us the responsibility of carrying on His work and fulfilling His mission. If we don’t reach the nations, who will? We are His people. We are the ones who have the Word of Life. We have been blessed to receive the hope of salvation. When will we get serious about sharing it with the rest of the world? If not now, when?

Well done–you’ve created a budget. The next step is to track your budget over time to make sure you’re sticking to it.

I rang the librarian a few weeks ago as soon as I knew about the 5th February national day and offered my services. At that point,they didn't have a support group. And by yesterday they had a loudhailer, stewards, bunting, clipboards,a rota, home-made cakes, a celebrity and lots of willing readers.

HOTmilk is actually based out of New Zealand but they sell in the United States too! They specialize in providing SEXY and supportive nursing and maternity lingerie. I received their "Awakened by Her Desire" bra and panty set for review. When I opened the package I thought they had sent the wrong thing because at first glance I couldn't even tell it was a nursing bra! I wondered how supportive it would be since it wasn't an underwire and I was pleasantly surprised to find it was very comfortable and supportive. I did find that it seemed to run just a tiny bit small so I wish I would have opted to order one size bigger in the band and cup. One very unusual (but awesome) thing about the HOTmilk nursing bra is that it has 6 rows of snaps on the bra band to allow for lots of flexibility in the band sizing as you lose your pregnancy weight. I'll save you the details of exactly what my husband thought, but I'll just say that the mere sight of it hanging up in the bathroom had him calling me at school asking when I was coming home to model!

One look at the names of people in the Capitol screams, “Hey! This is like ancient Rome!” Cinna’s name comes from none other than Julius Caesar’s first father-in-law. Octavia was the sister of Octavian, the first true emperor of Rome, who later became known as Caesar Augustus. Flavia is the feminine form of the family name Flavius, which means ‘blonde’ or ‘golden’ in Latin. At the end of Mockingjay, we learn that Katniss’ doctor is named Dr. Aurelius, as in the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius.
4) Put your stove into low fire, and put the chocolate chunks into the bowl.Once the chocolate melts, that’s the time you can mix in however much amount of crispies, nuts, cookies or even raisin (if you want) into the bowl, or you can have it plain. You can use a silicon spatula to mix the chocolate.
This definition allows people some freedom to fail. There are times when having all the answers actually becomes a hindrance to team growth. In reality, great leaders understand that you can be completely right and still be wrong. Not every situation requires the “most-correct” answer. Why? Because time has shown that great leadership is a journey, not a destination. It’s a slow growth process that needs many different experiences to develop and strengthen ones ability to execute.

Trey was held back by the police as he tried to enter his drive. No less than six black and whites had surrounded his house along the end of their quiet cul-de-sac and yellow crime scene tape criss-crossed his driveway, front door and garage. He was panicked and when the duty officer realized who he was he led Trey personally inside, warning him gently that there was a lot of blood and he should brace himself.

If you find a vehicle that is sold for a much lower cost that you imagined it would be, ask yourself first the probably reasons why it is sold for such a low price. Cars that are usually sold with low prices when it could have been more have actually something wrong with it. Maybe it was stolen. Maybe it has been flood-damaged. Maybe it has already been in an accident.

The law of defamation protects a person’s reputation and good name against communications that are false and derogatory. Defamation consists of two torts: libel and slander. Libel consists of any defamation that can be seen, most typically in writing. Slander consists of an oral defamatory communications. The elements of libel and slander are nearly identical to one another.
What were the lights for? To light up political shenanigans for a public weaned on reality shows with appetite for more? I didn’t really know for sure, but the book cover offered enough fodder to feed the imagination. And the goat in the mix? Unless the goat was the electorate, calmly and routinely led to the slaughter post-elections, time after time.
This first piece addressed the evidence of DCS Phil Williams of the Metropolitan Police, who gave the High Court evidence about Operation Caryatid, which resulted in the convictions of Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman. DCS Williams’ evidence regarding the investigation, and what the police did, and more particularly did not, do seems even more concerning than it did at the time I write about it. Quite how the police managed to investigate so few people, in light of what we now know of what there was by way of evidence, remains baffling.
Article 24 Where an agriculture administrative department of the people’s government at the county level or above finds that a place of origin of agricultural products is endangered by pollution, it shall order the entity or individual causing such pollution to take measures to reduce or eliminate the pollution. If the said entity or individual refuses to do so, that shall be reported to the people’s government at the same level to punish it (him).
So with the war picking up steam, Frankie's rookie season was deemed good enough to be picked up by the Pirates organization who sent the young shortstop to the Class D Hornell Maples in the PONY League. While he didn't exactly tear up the league, he did boost his average to .271 in 129 games as the teams starting shortstop. He had 39 RBI's and belted 2 home runs, the only ones he ever hit in his career. The baseball odyssey of Frankie Zak was underway.
The story is about four bright and mature sixth graders who are the underdogs at the Academic Bowl (like Academic Decathlon, but for middle school). But their experiences (and the way they reflect on their experiences) make them wise beyond their years. They are called The Souls, which I thought was a little cheesy, and maybe the only wrong note in this whole book, but I thought of them as The Old Souls. They were able to find an acceptance of themselves that helped give them self-confidence and the ability to rise above typical sixth grade drama, like bullying and playing tricks on the teacher.

For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. (John 17:2 -3). Not an idea (know about you) but an experience (know you).

So when I saw ALL of the shades at K-Mart I couldn’t resist the pretty bright gold packaging with the gorgeous baked swirled goodness peeking out.
My project is a 2 page layout and what is more springy than lemonade stands. Hope you enjoy my layout.

The dissipating smoke in the bar's atmosphere took my voice with it.
Of course it is easy to point fingers at the current Administration and President Bush and I notice that many are doing that. I don’t know enough about American domestic politics to have any informed opinions but my feeling from watching the news is that the aftermath of this disaster could have been handled better. Just the same as the Swedish government could have handled the winter storm better, as well as the response to the tsunami that claimed the lives of a lot of Swedish tourists on vacation in Thailand.

There seems to be much debate about skipping ECC, but I feel it is the best move for our family.
We were having TV signal reception problems at our house earlier this week, so we didn't get to watch American Idol. But, I was looking online and saw that my favorite this year, Phillip Phillips, sang "The Letter," originally recorded by The Box Tops in 1967.

Article 132(1) of the Federal Constitution defines “public services” to include the armed forces, the judicial and legal service, the general public service of the Federation, the police force, the joint federal-state public service, the public service of each state and the education service.
This recent disaster was a most definitely obvious event when viewed from the longer term perspective. Mother Earth has, in fact, been awakening from her sleep for over a year. Let’s look at the chain of related incidences that ran through the build up to the Cardinal Cross of 2010 and continuing into 2011. January 12, 2010: Haiti Earthquake; February 27: Chile Earthquake: April 15: Eyjafjallajok Volcanic eruption; April 20: BP Gulf Oil explosion (yes, human made, yet caused by disconnected businessmen playing god with mother nature and creating their own seismic events – she’s still leaking from this wound).

The new Municipal Building, though not as lavish as the Art Deco Travis County Courthouse, or the Spanish/Italianate Revival buildings going up at UT, still got some attention in the architectural press. The structure consisted of four floors in a C-shape, with a courtyard to the east.

Mulcahy had a leisurely dinner and began walking the streets of Copenhagen. He couldn’t sleep. He recalled a trip he and Terpil had taken to a firm called Defense Apparel in Hartford, Conn., where Terpil discussed the possible purchase of up to 100,000 suits that would protect humans exposed to radioactivity. Could the Redeye carry a nuclear warhead? He knew now he would never place the Redeye order.
All of this together adds up to one single conclusion: The New York State Education Department is guilty of child abuse. Let me say it again, this time slowly: The New York State Education Department is guilty of child abuse. And incompetence.

I told her "that's good" and now I won't worry when they go walking in the break of dawn with her coyote stick and whistle! Or should I?
When the sun disappears, it immediately gets colder in here and I've had to turn on the heater. I have the feeling I should be eating hot soup or other hearty winter fare. I have at this moment a terrible craving for a stew or a chowder and I wish I was in the States so I could easily take care of it. I guess I'm in the mood for some real American food but that is hard to get. I wouldn't mind going to a Denny's right now and having my pick of the menu.
Those cats had a perfectly warm barn to go to..yet here they were huddled on the steps. I noticed that someone brought Grandma a wooden ski decoration and a festive wreath, I wonder why one ski was stained and one was natural looking? I will guess that this photo was taken some time in the 1970’s around Christmas time.

On the issue of name-calling and the rest of it, I cannot see how this is motivated by anything other than a belief in some of the stereotying and stigmatisation of lone parents that has justified the attacks on them in the past. It is appalling that the Minister would be involved in justifying any of that because I do not believe she herself believes any of those stereotypes and yet this legislation can only be motivated by that because that is the effect it will have. It will attack those very sectors of society which two years ago the Minister and her party colleagues were championing and defending against precisely this sort of legislation.

So, I think I'm first supposed to list seven things I love. This was really hard. Narrowing it down to seven, I mean. Food comprised a good 2/3 of the starter list, so whittling it down got a little easier after I decided that I should first eliminate most of the food, along with the obvious and predicable items, such as these boys, this entertainment franchise, and this hot geek.
And while on the subject of "madness"...I refuse to let change get the best of me! My thought was to redo the look of my blog...you know lighter and brighter...well, after writing this post, maybe it's a little too maddening.

I’m terrible (or extremely proficient) at procrastination. However, doing things like the reading challenge, and the dig in challenge give me a good excuse to write, and increase my attention span for writing at the same time. I imagine if any of my old professors are reading this and depending on which degree they were from, I’m both shuddering and giggling at the thought.
The problem is that she’s thinking too small. You’ve heard it before, but I’m going to tell you again: We live in a global economy. Our world is becoming smaller and smaller, and social networking is a huge part of that evolution. As a speech consultant in New Jersey, she has no problem finding clients in the Tri-State area. But she’s an entrepreneur, the owner of a business of one. She can’t criss-cross the country to drum up business in person. And while she might have a Web site that is optimized well enough to draw a regional, national or international audience, she could do so much more to up her earning potential.
Hope you're all having a great week!
So you can imagine the joy with which I announced on one of those social networks (can't remember which, my life is a blur) that I was just ONE CHAPTER away from finishing.

Having performed beyond expectations in my investigation of that creepy kid who claimed to see dead people, I have impressed Dr. Crowe enough to get another assignment. This one is more in my area of expertise, an anthropological study of clan rivalries in a community of largely Asian immigrants; or, as Dr. Crowe indelicately puts it, big trouble in Little China.
But, then came the problem. He was innocent, worse yet he was actually responsible for alerting the police and saving lives.
When my 4 year old son saw this, he says it is an Angry Bird! I was going like, huh? Angry Bird?....then I suddenly realised that he was referring to the famous angry bird game. LOL!

After all, she’s probably right. Faeries are nature sprites. The small fluttery ones help the flowers bloom. The gnome-like ones work on decomposition and help fungus breakdown rotting matter. What if faeries are our anthropomorphism of these natural processes? That makes them real. I’d go further and suggest that faeries are live, actual beings that do indeed work with flora and vegetation, blossom and decay. Today we tend to call them the more uninspiring names such as butterflies, bees and woodlice. Perhaps faeries are the anthropomorphism of insects? When some people look at them they may see just an insect. Their boring lack of imagination sees a creepy-crawly. I see the miraculous circle of life. If I ingested enough ergot alkaloids I’d probably see pixie faces too, just like our ancestors did.

Yes, it's been a long damn time. for those of you who stop in once in a while on a hope and a prayer, said hope and/or prayer has been answered. And thanks for sticking around. The past, what, 6 months since I last posted have been busy, obviously, but not much has gone on in Muckney World. I have been brewing with some buddies, but nothing specifically here at MB. Plus I've been out of the beer world for a bit. Well, it's time to get back into it. I'm talking actual updates, some more partial mash brewing here at MB, and getting back to that "buying local" thing I was talking about last spring.

Now I can just hand over a pretty card, rather than spell out:
I always like to cheer for the underdog. However, I feel like we have only been shown one side of the story. Kelsier’s brother Marsh had some harsh words about Kelsier and his motives. I found it interesting that Marsh was once active in the rebellion and Kelsier was too busy partying and making money. However, after Kelsier’s punishment he “saw” the way. Is Marsh correct in his accusation that Kelsier is using this plot to enrich himself? Or is he using it for pure revenge? Or is he arrogant and he wants to see if he can get away with it? Right now, I think it is a combination of all three plus he saw firsthand how the Lord Ruler can be cruel. And I find it interesting that most of the group who is participating isn’t really for or against it. When Ham asks Vin if they are in the right trying to overthrow the Lord Ruler her reply is, “Does it matter?” Then Breeze responds with, “Well answered.” Are all of them in it for a challenge? Don’t get me wrong, this makes for an interesting story. It kind of reminds me of the movie Ocean’s Eleven and the challenge of breaking into Terry Benedict’s vaults.

But here’s the thing: I guess I’m not really a hard polytheist. Yes, I believe the gods are individuals and not just archetypes. But I think that individual deities are more like regional accents or separate species than they are like individual people. Nor do I think there is a singly divine pantheon misinterpreted in different places as the Romans did. Freyja is not every goddess. She is distinctly not several other heathen goddesses—she is not Skadhi or Hella, for sure. And she is certainly not many goddesses from many other pantheons—she is not Kali or the Morrigan or Hera. She is not even every love goddess—I’m almost certain she is not Aphrodite. But there are other goddesses she is, mostly.
I bring all this up because a few female authors of late have taken umbrage at the packaging of their books, complaining that the marketing strategy is too female, and that the publishers are selling the authors short. Most recently Polly Courtney dropped her publisher because of cover art she claimed made her novels seem like chick-lit.
So, now I need your help in deciding which style to get. Here's what I've narrowed it down to:
These two very different appeals for the same outcome are what are called “writer-based reasons” and “audience-based reasons.” A writer-based reason may sound perfectly logical to you, but you aren’t trying to persuade yourself, right? An audience-based reason takes the values and beliefs of those you are trying to persuade (or inform, or entertain) and attempts to think like they do.

The hooded man stepped up to her, balled his cut hand into a fist, and raised it towards her face. What was he going to do? She kept her eyes fixed on the knife in his other hand, afraid that he would stab her if she dared to look away from it.

Before giving birth to my first boy, I decided to celebrate ‘solitude’ before parting me for who knows how long. A child is coming to be lovingly attached to me. He is part of me and I am part of him. I had no clue how this would be but I realized I will miss my solitude.
I am aware that I am a little late in casting my wishes for a blessed 2012 out to you. I feel as though I literally and figuratively fell in 2012. Literally, I had a bad fall on Friday Dec. 30th and have been pretty much incapacitated for days. Figuratively, I feel like Alice in Wonderland suddenly dropping down into a tunnel called 2012.
Gwyneth must now unearth the mystery of why her mother would lie about her birth date to ward off suspicion about her ability, brush up on her history, and work with Gideon--the time traveler from a similarly gifted family that passes the gene through its male line, and whose presence becomes, in time, less insufferable and more essential. Together, Gwyneth and Gideon journey through time to discover who, in the 18th century and in contemporary London, they can trust.

Pick 7: Jaguars
Bob is what you call an example of the kid whose mother should have smacked him in the mouth but didn’t. But really, you have to hand it to him, he has a sense of humor. Too bad the only person who thinks he’s funny is him. When I think of Bob as a kid, I think of a funny looking myopic fat troll, shirt hanging out of his pants, the end of his belt hanging down in front and snot running down his nose. You have got to figure he needs to make fun of normal people. I mean, what else does he have going for him, really?
Spain has a 57 on the cultural scale of Hofstede’s analysis. Compared to Arab countries where the power distance is very high (80) and Austria where it is very low (11), Spain is somewhat in the middle on the continum. However, the country does lean toward a higher level of inequality. For instance, Spain has an unequal distribution of wealth and there is a distance gap between the wealthy and lower-income society. The country tries to close the chasm by creating many government sponsered programs such as universal health care.
