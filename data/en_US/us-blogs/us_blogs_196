Morello: Aw, Phreak’s whimpering.

Even if he wasn’t blinded by the setting sun and the sweat that was running into his eyes, in his agitation he was unable to register the exact order of events. The oars were still splashing and there was a lot of screaming. Someone was shouting orders, then just shouting. Not all the screams sounded scared. A few must have thought it exciting and were calling to each other, looking for spectators and admiration as they jumped into the murky water before the boat completely overturned to its side. A single child’s voice rose above the din in a continuous, unnerving wail.
On April 2nd we set off on the Cosmos Tour called “British Panorama”, it covered England, Scotland and Wales. It was the first time I had been on a bus tour, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. Now I do…expect great sights, excellent accommodation, a knowledgeable tour guide and lovely company.
She got up from her bed and crossed the small hallway to the bathroom. Her mom rested her head on the floor, right next to the cold bowl of the toilet. A dribble of pinkish slime ran down her cheek. Mary took the closest towel in her hand and gently wiped her mother's face clean. She got a bottle of aspirin from the medicine cabinet and filled the glass of water that sat by the sink. She helped her mom sit up and swallow a few pills and covered her with a blanket on the floor again.
So..let me gird myself up with umbrella and credit card and head out here shortly.
Then I saw a shadow. I slowly crept closer and there he was, sitting in the only patch of snow on the block. No wonder we didn't see him. He was busy licking what was left of the little neighbor girl's snowman. I think he thought he'd found his twin.

“We cannot be, as a country, in a situation where our one and, in many cases, only energy partner could say no to our energy products. We just cannot be in that position.”
When Mr October, a sexy calendar pin-up vamp, is accused of murdering his girlfriend, an old debt is called in and Genny is forced to help prove his innocence, risking her job and the protection it offers – and threatening to expose her own dark secrets. Searching for the killer plunges Genny deep into the hidden heart of vampire society. It’s not long before she realises that she and Mr October are both unwitting pawns in a centuries-old power struggle between London’s non-human communities . . . and it’s not just her own neck that’s at stake, but the lives of all London’s supernaturals.
It was at that moment that many things happened at once. Firstly, Alice, backing away from the apparition form of her brother, tripped over. Her shoes had managed to locate yet another root poking out from the undergrowth. Secondly, the misty and translucent vision of Alice’s brother had come closer and she noticed that he had changed ever so slightly in appearance. It was if his features had been blurred, or burned and inexpertly patched back together again. His eyes had focussed with an unnatural hunger and burned momentarily red. At the same time as she noticed this she fell over, and by doing so, her hood fell back and her skirt flew up.
When we first launched our Apple-a-Month Club subscription service in October, it was with a mix of excitement, trepidation, and, to put it bluntly, low expectations. Admittedly, this was a defense mechanism, so that each new subscription would thrill us rather than the small numbers of people who blindly trust our taste feeling like a slight.
So, what does that have to do with a ‘beautiful symmetry’ then?

It was fabulous. For three whole days we got to trade in our pajamas-till-noon, mac & cheese-cooking, taxi-drivin', sleep deprived selves for fun clothes, high heels, delicious food (made by someone else!) and all sorts of great swag. It was really refreshing to be outside of our normal 24-7 job of being a mother.
My guy and I don't have any health problems like the gentlemen in the film but figure that we could stand to be a little pickier about what we put in our bodies. We have decided to give this juicing this a try. We haven't started yet; we're still waiting for our super spiffy juicer to arrive. I am excited, but a little nervous to commit to this. I'm worried that I'll only last a day and a half then go on a crazy carb binge. Kidding, kinda. OK, not really...it totally sounds like something I'd do.
Thursday saw us start making cake pops, finalise shopping and to-do lists, and generally getting all excited over the final arrangements.
At first I don’t think he believed me. He’s definitely not used to being an object of affection, and I think he thought I might be making fun of him. (It’s a good thing I vastly out-level him, because making fun of Frank is not a wise life decision.) It probably didn’t help that I had to admit that I think the name of his admirer is Sasche, but I’m not entirely sure. I just directed him to TotA — she’ll be able to introduce them.

I recently wondered if Continuum was too extreme for it to be really successful. I know that due to it's very high hop loading, right from bittering hops, through late aroma hops and ending with a stupid level of dry hopping in tank, it clearly strikes fear into those meek drinkers who get vertigo when faced with high level hop compounds. My love of crystal malt as a belay for protection against unbalancing, when on the edge of top level hop exposure, often attracts criticism.

I teach fourth grade and I really don’t mind if a child has a cell phone in their back pack. I understand the county policy of no cell phones in the classroom, but if a parent writes a note explaining why their child has a cell phone on a particular day, I don’t mind at all. If the phone mistakenly goes off during class, I give the child a lazer shooting out of my eyes look, and quietly put a mark on their MonkeyShines behavior chart.

8:07 PM – Edge starts off by question who the John Cena standing in the ring is? He wants to talk to the John Cena who was one of his greatest opponents ever. You know, the one who threw him in the Long Island Sound. He reminds John about his love for wrestling. He reminds John that the industry means nothing to guys like Brock Lesnar, and begs Cena to wake up. He then says that he is not asking John Cena to beat Brock Lesnar, he is telling him to. Nothing quite like a Rated R Superstar pep talk. Edge is greatly missed in my house.

The trailer makes it seem quirkier than it really is. It is actually the story of a young man who discovers he has Stage 4 cancer (this is not a spoiler, it’s the first scene in the movie!) and takes off on a spontaneous road trip to “live a life” before he becomes a patient and fights imminent death. It’s quite a love letter to Josh’s homeland of Canada – lots of magnificent scenery and gorgeous vistas. It made me want to visit Canada, and not just because you may meet a guy who looks like Pacey in a National Forest and get to have sex with him (although, they may want to add that to their travel literature )
He said that deep inside he just didn’t love me

Hey all! Monday morning came bright and early for us. Well, not too early :) 7:30 or so. That's a nice time to wake up. I got the kids breakfast, checked some emails, and we headed off to Wal-Mart. The kids had allowance money that was SERIOUSLY burning a hole in their pockets. Unfortunately, the little kids only had one and two dollars. Not much to buy at Wal-Mart for a buck :) I let the big kids go to the toy section, and the little kids and I went to get Captain America his Protein Powder for his protein shakes.
As I touched upon earlier, people often associate PTSD with wildly unpredictable and violent behavior. But, in reality, this is not the case. While it’s true that anger and irritability are two symptoms associated with PTSD, this doesn’t mean a person with this disorder is an emotional ticking time bomb. I believe what’s often left out of discussions about PTSD and potential violent behavior, is a person’s inborn traits. As you all know, some people have personality traits that make them more confrontational or aggressive than others. So PTSD, or any major stress factor, may make a naturally aggressive person more susceptible to lashing out in anger than a less aggressive person. But, I believe, this is the case only if the naturally aggressive person has poor impulse control to begin with. I feel it’s unrealistic and unfair to believe that simply because someone has PTSD, they are automatically more violent than the average person.

As I said in my earlier post ECB’s Rate Cut And Liquidity Analgesic, the LTROs acted like analgesics, taking the pain out of the crisis, easing the widening interbank rates allowing banks to finance themselves at more normal levels. They entered in carry trades on higher yielding Italian and Spanish bonds but unlike QE where new cash keeps coming month after month, the market was hit by a wall of money and the momentum has been lost, not helped by the German’s inability to agree to a bigger, more suitable firewall. A lot of what goes in the market is about maintaining the momentum but momentum has run out and has begun to go the other way until the policymakers again decide to take control of the situation and push momentum in the right direction.

Canada could use a superhero about now. We’d take a few more ordinary heroes instead — those willing to speak against the corruption that has sapped the will and ability of our authorities to hold powerful politicians accountable for serious crimes against our nation. Even American convicts are in awe at the corruption and coverup.
Just a quick blog today. I just realised that cameras are becoming quite the popular thing these days. I’m not sure if I should be converted as well, but I did find that the iPad as a worthy investment. So maybe I will be persuaded by the new Nikon D3200 to finally succumb to creativity. Only time will tell, more importantly, the Australian release date. However, if any of you do know of a good camera out there. I would be very interested in purchasing one. So let me know about what you think.

But they also both involve potential "dangers" that might make it "unsafe" for my children to live and learn in freedom - vases, televisions, pictures, and computers which generally do not respond well to being knocked around.But I'm not really talking about the dangers of broken glass or falling objects.
A few years ago Heather went to an after Christmas sale and bought up the remnants she liked best for $2 /meter. She zipped off a bunch of simple bags of various sizes and put them away for the next year's gift wrapping. Brilliant! I personally am not a fan of red and green, I rarely do "normal" for Christmas. It certainly doesn't have to be just holiday themed patterns though. In fact, I am adopting an entire spectrum of these bags for birthdays and such as well... and this neutral bag with the tree on the front is another lovely idea. I think stamped or silk screened pine cones would be gorgeous. I haven't taken on silk screening before, but I have a friend who does it and would probably be willing to do a trade. Regardless... this is the most easy peasy sewing project imaginable!
Yep, I gotta say that I love Stacey even more after reading that. (I think the fact that she was a Cyndi Lauper girl at 6 gives her major coolness points.)

Sharon, take a look, my friend.
These past two weeks, I’ve kind of dropped off the face of the Earth, as far as my blog and even the blogosphere is concerned. After my last post, I just didn’t have the energy to even turn on my computer at home, much less to gather my thoughts coherently enough to blog or leave comments. I didn’t even manage to read more than a post or so a day, if at all. Just know that even then, you guys were always in my thoughts!
Other times, this tolerance can be quite terrible in effect. We are admonished to “understand” and “tolerate” and “uncover the truth behind” behaviour like drug-dealing and drug use, abuse, addiction, and other unacceptable societal problems. If I am free to do what enriches me, I am also free to become morbidly obese, hit and scream at my children, dress in scraps of clothing, smoke/drink/drug myself as I will, and generally do what I like unto death. Fortunate are those who have caring family members or friends who will intervene when tolerance is strained to the limits, but otherwise, others often will not say a word directly to the person concerned.
I am not usually very political.
but restrained myself.
When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

From a leaseholders perspective you can imagine a model similar to Community Land Trusts whereby the CLT owns the freehold and always will with householders or RSLs only holding a leasehold interest in the land. Of course if leases are long a proportion of the value would become economic rent so it might be necessary to include the kind of clawback mechanisms you see in many affordable housing schemes whereby the trust claims back all increases in the land value, and the householder keeps all increases in the house. This would be a particularly attractive model for self builders, whether individuals or self builders of modular schemes such as those carried by by bodies such as the Walter Segal Trust.

In 9th grade the Journalism teacher came to our class "recruiting" students for the newspaper. I thought it sounded like the dumbest thing based on her presentation, so I wasn't interested. But many of my friends joined the next term. One day, a couple weeks into the new term my friend invited me down to the newspaper room so she could finish an article. I saw a room full of computers, so I sat down and started drawing on one. The teacher came out to chew me out about being on off-limits computers. Then she saw what I had drawn and "hired" me for the newspaper. Thus began my formal graphic designing.

And in this game of deceit, LIES and being played, she is the most foolish of all. I, at least, got out. She knew everything before going in and still CHOOSES to be a disloyal, unkind and uncaring human being toward me, her long time friend who only ever showed her love, support and kindness for nearly two decades.
Of course that is what my main character is looking for. She has another, unrelated motivation at the very beginning of the story, which she soon loses, and at that point she finds herself with no purpose. The rest of the book is her discovering her purpose, then running away from it (literally) then actively chasing it even though she fears it, and finally coming to terms with it at the end. Now that I realize this is her motivation, I can see that it moves everything else in the plot--only when she finds her purpose and embraces it can the story end. It also makes sense now that she is the only character in the entire book who doesn't have anything she obviously wants!

With a lot of qualifying taking place in the early round, the meet got going in earnest with the women's steeple heats. And if the heats are any indication, then gold is going to Gulnara Galkina (RUS). Running in Heat 1, she simply ran clear of the field and never looked back. She seems to know only one way to run, annihilate the competition! Which is what she did, winning easily in 9:17.67 with her closest competitor, Antie Molder (GER) a far back second in 9:21.73 - a National Record! So dominant was Galkina that she controlled the next two heats as heat 1 was so fast that everyone else had to finish in the top 4 of their heats to assure qualification! Among the qualifiers was Jenny Barringer (US) who controlled the first half of her heat before settling in and falling back slightly, then kicking in the final 200 to secure her place. Barringer's speed will certainly be a plus, but I don't see anyone being a match for the Russian. Makes me wish Jenny had chosen the 1500.

The desire to eat healthfully while on holiday ran straight into a favorite Noodle travel ritual - the Sharing of Cheesy, Crunchy Snacks. Early in our marriage, when our finances couldn't yet afford airfare to visit family out of state, my husband and I relied on roadtrips to take us where we needed to go. From North Carolina to Northern Virginia, from Charlotte to Chicago to Atlanta and countless treks in between, a full tank of gasoline and a package of faux-fromage fare were all the fuel we needed. At first, it was Planters Cheez Balls, which dusted the dashboard with Yellow#4 & Red#6 cheddar-ish powder and left bright orange fingerprints on the steering wheel. Nowadays, our meandering munchies of choice are the less messy but no less cheesy Pepperidge Farm Goldfish, beloved treat of stroller-bound tots everywhere and listed as #2 in Time magazine's Nine Kid Foods to Avoid.

It was strange talking over my history. The things that happened 5, nearly 6 years ago; the living with friends, couch surfing, that one night in the park, the junkie flats, the refuges…it seems like so much of a blur. I honestly don’t know how I came through that time & managed to escape the drug culture – I rarely drink & have never smoked, I’ve never taken anything that wasn’t prescribed. I feel so different from the girl who used to have screaming matches with her mother, dodging hurling items; while her father sat idly by. Disturbed by what was going on, but not disturbed enough to intervene.

Next stop, gasoline - and the third phone call from my daughter. Needless to say, the cell phone store won the battle, and I was officially done with them. I called customer service (for about the 10th time in 3 days), apologized up front for my attitude, and angrily explained everything we had been though. For a change, I got someone who would listen to me. This wonderful woman bent over backwards to solve our issues, applied rebates that for some reason just weren't available for the previous reps to apply, and will be the recipient of a very nice letter to her manager. I'm crossing my fingers that our problems are solved finally. We will know tomorrow.
What's a blog for if not to rant?

This “hard problem” was never “solved.” It simply faded away as organic chemistry and physiology steadily explicated the physical mechanisms and processes occurring in various parts of cells, and in the various organs of the body. This took some time, well into the 20th century, but by the 1940s, anyway, it was no longer credible to claim that “life” was something that might not be present when these mechanisms and processes of organic chemistry were present, or might be present in their absence. “Life” will always be an ambiguous concept to some extent (there is ongoing debate as to whether viruses are living, for example), because it is an emergent property, but its physical nature is no longer seriously challenged. The concept of “consciousness” is now undergoing the same evolutionary process – not a similar process, the very same process.

The teacher’s performative cues must be presented openly so the class will perceive what they value (in their words) as the teacher’s “passion” and “caring about / respecting the students.” The reciprocal degree to which students feel the passion and trust the teacher’s feelings as being sincere will have a salutary influence upon the depth and extent to which the subject-matter is learned.

I would surmise that any sane person would attempt to prevent the act to be executed. And therein lies my first problem: a stated act of faith can look every bit as crazy as any abject act of senseless (senseless for whom?) religious violence to any body who is not privy to God’s intention.

If this result were overturned by a court or international body, rather than by a further referendum, this would be an outrageous and very dangerous precedent, as it would signify the end of democracy and of national self determination in any meaningful way. What next? Regime change by tribunal?

Since The Nugget was a newborn, we have spent her sleepy time in the glider in her bedroom, rocking and singing. In the beginning, her sleepy time often coincided with mine.

Swanson was indeed one of the great stars of the silent era. Swanson worked at Paramount Pictures and with Cecil B DeMille. For a time she was the highest paid star in Hollywood. In that respect she was born to play the role. Some say that the role was based on another silent film star, Norma Talmadge. The similarities however happily end there. The scene in which she appears with DeMille (who plays himself) and meeting Desmond after a long absence is a heart-warming one in terms of their history and careers. DeMille refers to Desmond as “Young Fella” in the scene, a name he lovingly created for Swanson.

In this context, American CIA also got the services of Israeli secret agency Mossad and Indian RAW in order to fuel sectarian violence in Iraq.

She started off doing something that fascinated her, that kept her thinking about things that were wrong in the educational system. One thing that frustrated her was that teachers went to many training seminars, ran back to their classrooms, and did the innovative things that they learned at the seminar for about a month or two, and then fell back into their old, poor habits of teaching. In her program, people do things consistently and don’t only stop at the introduction of the concept.

Sometimes there are fields that appear to hire while others like drama will require exceptional talent and not usually be the career choice of many either yesterday or tomorrow. It however will give us the imagination and inspiration to find ways to turn it into a job that uses unique qualities not found elsewhere. In the past if we specialized in degrees that pertained to teaching and nursing we were almost always going to be hired but with the lay offs in education, you will find yourselves facing the reality that people with art degrees and business degrees have faced since graduating college for generations before you.

In this story, Hitler is drawn almost heroically. More than likely, Cole's intent was not to exonerate a dictator, but rather to just make The Claw seem as evil as possible. No doubt Cole, like most of the world, had no idea he was playing with fire. Even the great Charlie Chaplin said later that he would not have made "The Great Dictator," if he had known the depths of the Hitler and Nazi Germany's horrible madness.
I don’t believe that reconciliation is possible anymore. The moral righteousness pleasure that Sons of Onan derive from tightening the noose while practicing their vice is too addictive. And so, Wall Street Democrat-or-RINO banksters and Fannie-Freddie Affirmative Action saboteurs are recast as “conservatives who saw an investment opportunity,” a Wise Latina slides on the oily hosannas of white (and mostly male) U.S. Senators into a ducal fiefdom at the U.S. Supreme Court, and a black political operative in the U.S. Department of Justice run by a black race-baiter Attorney General working for an ethnocentric black U.S. President orders the squashing of an investigation of black thugs intimidating white voters, while Sons of Onan keep leafing in their minds through the glossy centerfolds of white racism and conservative malfeasance.

But there’s one last thing that nice people don’t know. It is that hucksters aren’t confined by the same boundaries they assume everyone else is contained by. They are capable not only of sucker-punching you, but of exceeding limits you never thought could be transgressed. Grifters are in some sense not part of the same civilization that Peretz, Brooks, and Noonan inhabit. Maybe they don’t believe this yet. But they will. They will.

Pandora’s box was an artifact from Greek legend. It was the box given to the worlds first created women “Pandora”. The box contained all the evils of the world and Pandora was told not open the box under any circumstances. But as in life, curiosity and the wanting to know, prompted by the ego proved too much for Pandora and she open it. All the worlds evils flew out into the world,..the only thing that remained in the box was HOPE!.

This double movement of secrecy is described by John of the Cross: “in darkness the soul not only avoids going astray but advances rapidly . . . To reach an new an unknown land and journey along unknown roads, travelers cannot be guided by their own knowledge . . . the soul, too, when it advances, walks in darkness and unknowing . . . persons who tread this road and desire to give an account of this experience . . . are unable to describe it. They feel great repugnance in speaking about it, especially when the contemplation is so simple that they are hardly aware of it

The designers in question might be irritated by these copies but sometimes they do indeed fight back. Gucci is in the middle of a nasty court battle with Guess over copyright infringement of their signature logo, which Guess is denying, but we all know it is in fact true. The Italian label’s signature GG logo has been plastered on Guess products for years and it seems Gucci finally had enough of the knockoff charade accusing the company of a “massive, complicated scheme to knock off Gucci’s best-known and iconic designs”.

That's part of the reason that I'm not a fan of placements, and why we don't do them here at Sell! Sell!.

So, by adopting the newer disciplines like social media research and ‘neuro/biometrics’, which means listening and watching as well as questioning, we can address many of the issues outlined above. If we are able to effectively bring ‘culture-neutral’ technologies into the mix, we can make significant progress towards overcoming the twin challenges of ‘reserved’ and ‘extreme’ responses to direct questions which impact conventional market research in Asia.
According to the plea agreement, Hassoun told a law enforcement cooperating source (CS) in early June 2010 that he wanted to commit acts of violence in Chicago and suggested bombing the commercial area surrounding Wrigley Field as one option. Hassoun said that an attack against such an entertainment center could “paralyze” Chicago commerce. The CS told Hassoun that he/she had friends who might be willing to pay Hassoun to perpetrate such an attack. Hassoun and the CS continued to discuss Hassoun’s terrorist attack ideas during the following weeks, and Hassoun indicated that he wanted to meet the CS’s contacts and was anxious to act against Chicago.

I finally had a chance to catch live video of Hollie Cook (daughter of Sex Pistol drummer Paul Cook) performing on U.K. music TV show 'Later With Jools Holland' which was broadcast last week. After playing her eponymous album over and over this summer, I can say without hesitation she could be the new face of reggae! Her album, produced by none other than Price Fatty, has been the soundtrack to my summer and is without a doubt the finest UK reggae set of this year - if you haven't already, get it here.

18. See Reymond’s New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1998), pp. 324-330. Reymond misunderstands various remarks in Calvin’s Institutes which are directed against the teachings of a contemporary, Valentine Gentile, as if they were directed against the Nicene Fathers. According to Calvin, “certain rascals” of his own time (Valentine Gentile and his disciples), asserted that the Father “in forming the Son and the Spirit, infused into them his own deity,” and thus in a “dreadful manner of speaking” they say that the Father is the only “essence giver.” In opposition to this teaching, Calvin affirms in the very words of the Nicene Creed, that Christ “is the Son of God because the Word was begotten by the Father before all ages.” (Institutes, 1.13.23). And again, in arguing against the errors of Servetus, who held that “the Word for the first time began to be when God opened his holy mouth in the creation of the universe,” Calvin asserts that “it is necessary to understand the Word as begotten of the Father before time” (1.13.7-8). Reymond completely misunderstands Calvin here if he equates the “dreadful manner of speaking” of Calvin’s “rascals” with the Nicene Creed itself. Reymond also badly misunderstands his words at the end of Book 1, chap. 13: “Certe nihil astute praeterii quod mihi adversum esse putarem: sed dum ecclesiae aedificationi studeo, multa non attingere consultius visum est, quae et parum prodessent, et lectores gravarent supervacua molestia. Quid enim disputare attinet, an semper generet Pater? quando stulte fingitur continuus actus generandi, ex quo liquet ab aeterno tres in Deo personas substitisse. (“Certainly I have not shrewdly omitted anything that I might think to be against me: but while I am zealous for the edification of the church, I felt that I would be better advised not to touch upon many things that would profit but little, and would burden my readers with useless trouble. For what is the point in disputing whether the Father always begets? Indeed, it is foolish to imagine a continuous act of begetting, since it is clear that three persons have subsisted in God from eternity.”) This is notdirected against the “eternally begotten” teaching of the Nicene Creed, as Reymond would have the reader think; rather, it is directed against the kind of scholastic debate found in Lombard’s Sentences, book 1, distinction 9, about the propriety of using the word semper (“always”) in connection with the generation of the Son, which might seem to imply a perpetual begetting within time. There is no indication in any of Calvin’s writings that he disagreed with the doctrine of eternal generation as set forth in the Nicene Creed. On the contrary: he positively affirms it, and uses it against Unitarian heretics of his time. In a withering review of Reymond’s book that appeared in the Westminster Theological Journal 62/2 (Fall 2000), pp. 314-319, Robert Letham takes him to task for his misrepresentation of Calvin: “Reymond cites one short paragraph from Warfield’s fine article ‘Calvin’s Doctrine of the Trinity’ to argue that Calvin rejected Nicene trinitarianism (334-35). This article is ninety-five pages long and Warfield repeatedly affirms Calvin’s approval of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan doctrine of the trinity. For instance, ‘It will have already become apparent … that in his doctrine of the Trinity Calvin departed in nothing from the doctrine which had been handed down from the orthodox Fathers.’ He also underlines Calvin’s ‘pervasive’ approval of eternal generation and eternal procession (244-45)! From this long article Reymond extracts one small paragraph and uses it to counter all Warfield has carefully stated over scores of pages. This is shoddy” (p. 319).
I have been sewing since I was a kid. My mum taught me how to cross stitch when I was about 7. Can kids even hold needles at that age, or even speak? I have no concept of what kids can do at what age, but for the purpose of this nostalgic tale I shall say I was 7 and you shall be thoroughly impressed. I really don’t know why I liked sewing so much. It was probably a combination of me wanting to be just like my mummy and also being addicted to that sense of achievement you get when you completed something beautiful.
In most of the above scenarios, I take it for granted that the USA will remain a major global player, and find it likely that Asia will increase its share of global BNP (although not necessarily to the point of dominance). The big question mark here is Europe. Will Europe become Eurabia, and be crushed by the other infidel powers? Will she slowly decline into third world status, or will she have the strength to expel Islam and forge a new beginning for herself, after generations of decline?

I've also made a brownie recipe out of my Taste of Home Baking Cookbook twice in the past week. It's a basic frosted brownie recipe, made from scratch, but it has a downfall ... if you eat it right away, it doesn't taste as good. You have to wait at least a day for it to settle (I guess) and "brownie up." Before that, it tastes like the dry ingredients just settled at the bottom and ... echh. Matt thought it was from a box, so I assume that means it's good!
Gudeg is a traditional food from Yogyakarta and Central Java, Indonesia which is made from young Nangka (jack fruit) boiled for several hours with palm sugar, and coconut milk. Additional spices include garlic, shallot, candlenut, coriander seed, galangal, bay leaves, and teak leaves, the latter giving a reddish brown color to the dish. It is also called Green Jack Fruit Sweet Stew. Gudeg is served with white rice, chicken, hard-boiled egg, tofu and/or tempeh, and a stew made of crisp beef skins (sambal goreng krecek). There are several types of gudeg; dry, wet, Yogyakarta style, Solo style and East-Javanese style. Dry gudeg has only a bit of coconut milk and thus has little sauce. Wet gudeg includes more coconut milk. The most common gudeg came from Yogyakarta, and usually sweeter, more dry and reddish in color because the addition of teak leaves. Gudeg is traditionally associated with Yogyakarta, and Yogyakarta often nicknamed as "Kota Gudeg" (city of gudeg). (Wikipedia).

Another specific problem with Borders right now - some publishers are afraid to send them books, in case they go out of business and can't pay for them. So even if a store like Borders - who has been awesome about supporting the Blood Coven series - wants to stock the books, they might not get to - unless they sort out their current financial situation. (Which I sooo hope they do!)

Dana Marie Bell, is a jewel I found while searching Amazon for something to read. She has several series and yes I have read them all. Her books remind me somewhat of Shelly Laurenston’s but with Dana’s own style. Her books range from shifters, to elves, to a chic that lives in a tree. At the end of the day they are hot, and addictive. Thank you Dana Marie Bell.
Wonderful thing it is, this being justified, or made just. If we had never broken the laws of God we should not have needed it, for we should have been just in ourselves. He who has all his life done the things which he ought to have done, and has never done anything which he ought not to have done, is justified by the law. But you, dear reader, are not of that sort, I am quite sure. You have too much honesty to pretend to be without sin, and therefore you need to be justified. Now, if you justify yourself, you will simply be a self-deceiver. Therefore do not attempt it. It is never worth while.

It is FINALLY time to announce the top 10 designs of this year's Custom Design Contest! All entries were submitted to an independent panel of judges and were narrowed down to the top 10 designs.

I will put up the remaining contest entry designs when I get back from out of town in a couple of weeks.

This is a consistent policy of siding with the leftists, siding with the Marxists, siding with those who don’t support democracy, not standing up for our friends in Colombia, not standing up for our friends who want to engage and support America, who want to be great trading partners and great allies for our country, to be able to form that kind of bond that is so essential in our own hemisphere.

Apple and Microsoft seem to be impacted in a similar way by seasonal changes. For Amazon, which already has by far the lowest margin of all four companies, operating income decreased by 40% while it increased its headcount by 17%. This leads to much lower income per employee and with increased stock price to a doubling of its already very high P/E ratio. I’m not a stock market analyst, but Amazon’s P/E ratio of now near 200 seems extraordinarily high. By comparison, the other companies look downright cheap: Apple 8.8, Microsoft 10.5, Google 14.5

Williams comprehended that, as a modern American poet, as a representative of the new American poetics—in short, as a leonine abstraction—Pound stood for causes similar to his own. Wrote Williams in 1919, two years before his attack on Pound in Contact:

This year, when I arrived at the brewery I was about 60 or 70 people back in line, despite being half an hour early. By the time the event began, it looked like all 300 ticket holders had joined us in the wait for the doors to open. I thought it was a little silly to wait in line for an event that was only open to so many people, but it proved to have been worth it. After getting in and buying my raffle tickets, I immediately made my way to the keg of 1998 Boilermaker from full sail - a beer that ran out before the last ticket holders in the line made it through the door. Let me say this: 13 years later, this beer is fantastic, and I bet it will continue to age gracefully for many years to come; a fantastic example of how much time can do for the right beer.

It's the frustrated tone many parents use for criticizing, commanding, complaining. It sounds like:
The more I read, the more frustrated I am by this culture of meanness that we live in. As a culture, we are really mean to kids, especially teenagers. These "broken" kids end up at our house and I see beautiful people, where their parents see kids that they may love, but are not measuring up. Why why why? That is such a horrible place for kids to live in the hearts of their parents, to never measure up to perceived expectations. More thoughts on this here from someone else who really "gets" it!

The Rape of Nanjing, a truly horrid episode in the truly horrid and violent history of Japan, was in 1937 and yet the Americans did not cut off Japanese supplies until 4 years later, starting the embargo in August 1941. Why so long? Why the morality wait that allowed the Japanese to continue expanding for almost another 4 years? Amongst other things, in 1937, the Nationalist Chinese were sponsored by Hitler's Nazi Germany as well as the Soviet Union, while the Japanese main sponsors were the Americans and British/French.
Should one take note of the fact that it were the English who killed the Boers' cattle with bayonets, thereby depriving the children of their food sources, then the high fatality rate does not seem to be incidental.
Quiet and out of reach, nowhere is the place Larkin really wanted to be. As he confirmed in late middle age: “As for Hull, I like it because it's so far away from everywhere else. On the way to nowhere . . . and beyond . . . there's only the sea.”[7] When I think about the places I used to wander as a boy on the whole they did little to distinguish themselves – a beach is a beach and grass and shrubs are grass and shrubs – and I suspect that was one of things I liked about them; that they didn’t encroach on my thoughts.

Before we launch, though, I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce our medical advisor, Dr. Mark Gunderson. Dr. Gunderson is the founder and medical director of the Age Management Institute in Reno, Nevada. Dr. Gunderson originally introduced the idea to join forces with Nina Cucina as a follow up to his Accelerated Weight Loss Plan. He understands that his weight loss patients, as well as his age management patients, need a resource that can guide them in the kitchen to become, and stay healthy. Nina Cucina is that resource.

The new Board of Judicial Conduct would be created after years of complaints that the Court of the Judiciary did not aggressively investigate claims of judicial misconduct and was too closely tied to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which appointed more than half of its members. The measure, Senate Bill 2671, also sets up a procedure for investigating complaints against judges and requires the board to report regularly to the legislature on how grievances are resolved.

Whitney Houston lost me as a fan that day.

I can't remember when I last saw a shrew, and to be honest, I'm not absolutely certain I'd seen one in the wild before. I was fairly convinced I had - I recognised it instantly, and shrews are relatively widespread mammals aren't they? But if you asked me to pinpoint when or where I'd be a bit stumped. It occurred to me that before last week, it's just possible I'd only seen pictures of them in books.

As I am currently dealing with a case of Plantar Fasciitis (by the way, I don’t think I am ever going to be able to pronounce Fasciitis correctly) on my right foot, I wholly believed it was because my shoes were in need of replacing. So after work, I headed over to Big Peach inDecatur, which is where I buy all my running stuff. I carried in my old shoes and one of the guys who works there came over and asked if I needed to replace my shoes. I said “Yes.” Then I reconsidered for a couple of seconds and said “At least I think I do.” He replied by motioning me over to one of the benches and said “Let’s sit here and talk about it.”

But I don’t think they can teach parenting in books. Even medical ones. Or magazines. Experience means a lot. When they talk about limiting families to one child to control the population, I think that might spell the doom of mankind. What they really should do is give certain families license to Dugger-it big time, because it takes a few kids before you figure it out. The rest of us should not be allowed to reproduce at all. (It’s an idea anyway)

The harmonization process is as it sounds but it is not only the harmonization of the human race and all other races in the universe, first the harmonization of SOUL and SELF must take place, how can you harmonise with another race if you have not come into balance and harmony within SELF? This process may prove challenging to many, many are walking blindly into the new believing they have no work to do, that the way ahead is merely more of “same” and we guide this is the smoke and mirrors that we ask you to dissolve. The work to be done is on SELF, for SELF is the creator in the new world, SELF is the ship that you are sailing on and are creating around, for when SELF is in balance then YOU ARE. Do you understand our guidance? Our words?

The maintenance of strong client relationships rightly remains a huge competitive weapon for law firms. The existence of secure personal bonds with leading clients has enabled small and medium sized firms to retain very significant clients who might normally be expected to use larger or better known firms. Again, however, I can identify at least three problem areas. The first is the obvious truth that although some friendships endure for a long time, many relationships tend to atrophy naturally over a period. Clients can outgrow firms, move away from the locality, or change jobs, and accordingly fresh relationships constantly need to be forged and new clients have to be sought. The second problem is that some client loyalties are to individual lawyers rather than the firm and can therefore be lost if the partner leaves, retires or dies. The third issue is that client loyalties seem to have become somewhat strained during the recession. One reason for this might be that whilst loyal and long-standing clients are not always as fee sensitive as new clients, nevertheless they may in some cases may feel that advantage has been taken of them, or that they have been taken for granted. Reliance therefore on the loyalty of an existing client base carries enormous risk as key clients may become impossible to replace.

I amended the recipe in the book slightly because I didn't have all the ingredients. I went to the shops with a list of things I needed and came out with 3 bags of shopping and nothing on the list! This unfortunately is not a one-off for me, I actually love supermarkets. Like, really love them. There was a time that I'd sneak off to the supermarket at 2am and spend 1.5 hours just wandering around looking and buying. Plus I'm a sucker for the supermarket tricks that force you to walk through the whole store and pick up things you didn't go there for. They pretty much get me every time, I just get excited. I'm in recovery now and am getting better at sticking to the list but sometimes I have a relapse, like today :).

With the introduction of the House Price Database due by June 2012, which should ensure all transactions – cash and mortgage – are publicly available, I hope we can finally wave “Good Riddance” to asking price and estate agent valuation indices in Ireland. That’s not to say the accompanying narrative isn’t interesting or valid, it’s just that it is faintly ridiculous to have so much analysis of what are asking prices or valuation estimates. DAFT says prices in Longford rose by 10% in Q1,2012 and prices in Carlow fell by 10% – no doubt, that’s what asking price data is saying, but does anyone believe it?

No. She was snarky and rude about. I instantly said as she walked away and her husband was thanking my husband for holding the door. OH MY GOD did you seriously just hear what that lady just said? I'm like she just called him Fat. My sweet 7 month old FAT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? A baby is not fat--what is wrong with our society... if you can seriously look at a little baby that can't even walk yet and call them fat you seriously have problems and I feel very sorry for your kids.

However, if I remember correctly, Tiny calls him out on this behavior later in the book, and that’s another thing that I love about it. AAAAND, as the story progresses further, we see that Tiny is not the greatest friend sometimes, either. He’s very wrapped up in his crushes. He’s wildly reactionary to every emotion that courses through him. And a side effect of that is that all social interaction will revolve around Tiny Cooper, making it easier for WG to not seriously pursue any other friendships.
Those of you who have been visiting here for a while, know that I regularly cook along with my friends at I Heart Cooking Clubs, and that for the last five months we have been cooking the food of the lovely Tessa Kiros. As we choose a different chef to inspire us every six months, we only have one more month to spend with Tessa. I have been loving delving into her books, and would love to add more of them to my collection; sadly, budget constraints means an embargo on cookbook buying right now. Nevertheless, without buying another book I still have more recipes bookmarked in my existing collection than I will be able to cook in the remaining month. I could happily spend another six months with Tessa.

As it turned out, I recognized Duane Browne because he had lived less than a block from me for many years, and, like me, had frequented the Dean Deli Grocery. I realized this on Sunday, when, with the permission of the owners, Browne's friends erected a memorial against their wall. Inside, friends gathered occasionally to warm up and tell stories as the owners/clerks nodded sadly and kept everyone supplied with loosies. When I asked about the memorial, the young man (roughly my age, and Browne's) behind the counter shook his head and said "You remember him, right? He was always in here. They kill you in your own home . . ." He trailed off.

Around Kugel, Auslander has created a number of enthralling characters. Chief among them is Anne Frank herself, whom Auslander re-imagines as an elderly crone, shuffling around an attic as she types her never-ending novel. Anne has been poisoned against the human race, as you might imagine, given her experiences, and proves to be a fairly callous, uncaring tenant, one given to pronouncements on the Holocaust that should shrivel the soul. She is a malign, brooding presence in the Kugel attic, and one which drives a wedge between Kugel and his wife, Bree.

We went on to Swamp, the little village near Pevensey, and there called on Mrs Keswa, who had been a leader of the Liberal Party around there. We first saw the old granny, who went off to call her daughter Emily. They were Anglicans. We gave them copies of the Message and explained it to them. The young Mrs Keswa said she had been kicked out of the church, because she had started practising as an isangoma, which is why she now goes around with no shoes on. She had always had these powers, she said, but now her grandfather and grandmother (who are both dead) have told her to use them, and she even helps white people. And even though she had been kicked out of the church, she still believed, and they seem quite willing to distribute the Message. and call meetings to discuss it.

Her sister and brother-in-law were the witnesses; the flower girl was Oona O'Neill, who grew up to marry Charlie Chaplin at seventeen.
So, needless to say after yesterday’s mailbag, I’ve got a lot on my mind right now. I still plan on making some inspection stops in the Eastern Kingdoms, but the timetable might be spread out a little more than it would have been, what with some other things I need to check up on.
get you that freedom
Third, you should consider the evidence that will need to be accounted for. Very briefly, that will include the following:
A fresh-faced new intern suddenly burst through the door. "Hello, there! I'm Doctor Ross. Why don't you tell me what happened?"
Leaving Mantanani the next morning, we took our final photos as remembrance of the Arkitrek Camp experience. While several of us will have the chance to come back and see how the building has matured over time, some of the participants may never be able to visit this building again.
Mary was eventually overthrown and Elizabeth reigned. Though Elizabeth had her own form of state sponsored religion and requirements of practice throughout the land, the threat to the Pict progeny abated and all were safe to live as they always had, once again. Practicing and living by the beliefs of the ancient traditions were well known amongst the families that were birthed in the northern reaches of Scotland. The ancestors mingled little with strangers. They felt safe with those locals who knew them and were able to practice their art in the open amongst themselves. The local vicars gave their practices the nod. It was the thing to do. One could not change the nature of people who grew up with the land and all of nature’s blessings. It was the way they lived for hundreds of years. So long as outward appearances were maintained and the truth hidden from strangers and visitors from the crown, all was well and the traditions continued.

As Carrington explains it, his project Cathedral Scan—which will be performed live on Thursday, March 3, in the basilica of St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral in New York City—"translates the architectural plans of Gothic cathedrals into open-ended musical scores via custom software. Treating the plans as a kind of map, in the live performance Carrington navigates through them to create diverse rhythms, drones and textures."Groups of scanners filling the sonic spectrum may act in synch, forming a single harmonically-dense rhythm, or they may scan the plans at different speeds, resulting in complex polyrhythms. Each plan is treated as a modular score, with a distinct rhythm and timbre of its own. Also, by varying the speed and intensity of each scanning group, drone-like sounds may emerge based on the “resonant frequency” of the black and white plan.Coming out later this month, March 2011, is an album version, on which Carrington's work is "edited from a live concert in a large church space, and combines the direct signal created in software with the immense natural reverberation of the performance space."

Spencer and Chastain (in the best of her 6 performances from 2011) are obvious. Woodley is too, especially considering this category’s reputation as the ingenue category. McCarthy has a good chance, as comedic roles stand a chance in the supporting field. And I’ll round it out with Janet McTeer, because I hear things. But don’t fall asleep on Bérénice Bejo (The Artist).
By 1948, this had erupted into an undeclared war that would be waged until 1960. British forces sought to subdue the Communists, who had gained a degree of popularity for their resistance towards the Japanese. It didn’t help that in China, Mao’s Communist Party was on the verge of defeating the Kuomintang nationalist party.
We'll be touring the country, going to FBI field offices and meeting the agents and research teams, helping them learn how the real publishing industry works, and how to spot all the different kinds of writing scams. We'll actually be sworn in so we can view evidence and help with the analysis. It's possible we may even be able to go along when the FBI raids a scammer's home and/or office looking for manuscripts and other evidence! (One of our duties will be to work with Victim Witness Coordinators to help authors recover their work that has been seized as evidence.)
Oh, and I’d have to live like the woman of God, the wife, the mom, the friend . . . that I wanted them to become. Plus, I’d have to be on my best behavior all the time because kids pretty much don’t blink and miss stuff.

My children, especially my oldest two (ages 13 and 14), were quite taken with the 3-d graphics (you can view a demo - here), and clear depictions of the animals' anatomy, even if they where disappointed with the lack of an earth worm lab. I was thrilled to find easy to follow, in depth, high school level lessons, that take no prep or additional teaching on my part. I'm free to learn along with the children, instead of trying to stay one step ahead of them.
Tracy nurses her beer, peering down at the ice. "What are they doooing? Did we score yet?"
The thing about this event, though, is that the alcohol flows freely all night long. The idea (the very very successful idea) is that people will get drunk and make bad bidding choices and then spend too much money. It's a really good idea. A $31,000 idea, actually. My only responsibility these days, as part of the planning and organizing, is to procure the catering permit that will make the free alcohol legal. You're not allowed to sell alcohol at PTA events, you see; you can only give it away if somebody has donated it. But you do need a catering permit from the Alcoholic Beverage Control office in order to not have the police come.
I think we all dream of lazy days under a shade tree sipping lemonade. With fingers crossed I hope to squeeze in a day here and there to do just that. As my Mom use to tell me "Take some time to enjoy your life, the chores will sit and wait for your return" And low and behold they always do!!

After her session came Adam Baldwin’s, no relation to the Baldwin brothers though it did inevitably come up in the interview. He was a terrific guest, actively engaging with the audience, telling stories and just all around a great guy. His character in Firefly is a terrible person, so there is a really strong contrast between his show personality and the.. well… personality for shows? Regardless, he was great. A young boy had a few questions for him during the Q&A and Adam invited him up onto the stage proper to sit with him and ask the questions. The boy was beet red and Adam probably gave him the best memories he’ll have for a long long time to come as he answered the boy’s questions. Definitely a die-hard fan was forged. I was sitting behind him and his adult male escort (brother/dad/older family friend?) when the boy came back, and he had a huge grin just plastered across his face.
Yesterday, I offered readers the opportunity to download Safe Harbor from Amazon onto their Kindles, tablets, iPhones, PCs and laptops — free of charge. It was my chance to introduce readers to a new novel by an unknown author and get them building the buzz.

While I still don’t know why Congolese little girls are “tortured” with hair extensions, I think I’ve now found the answer for the fitness of children and teens: it’s the dance of contortions—of the lower legs, thighs, waist, and upper body, with the accompanying effects on the muscles of the neck; just like hula hooping or swimming. A normal Soukouss tune runs for about 8 minutes on average — this translates into a total cardiovascular workout. Besides playing football (soccer), Congolese kids dance all the time. Hence, their incredible fitness. Even the “Shegues”—the street kids and teens of Kinshasa—are fit like athletes! (And they are thus a real menace to the riot cops whenever there is a riot in the capital city. I've personally seen them in action on July 27, 2006 during the presidential campaign chasing "robots," as riot cops are called; I captured the mayhem on camcorder and posted two videos on YouTube: here and here.)
We shot the thing in like two takes and were so pleased with ourselves we then decided to head to this country bar called Wild Wild West. I'm not sure how I got in. Perhaps they never carded any of us int eh group or maybe somebody knew somebody working the door. I do not recall, but I wound up purchasing a large plastic cup for I believe 7 dollars. Possession of said cup meant unlimited refills of any draft beer.
For example I was reading a few articles about how people don’t like their jobs, how people do like their jobs, people who don’t have jobs, and various other articles about every type of employment possible and in most of them there was always an image along the lines of this

In our culture, sadly, I think most of us believe we are not enough because our worth needs to be constantly earned. There is a continual striving to do more, to achieve more, and to acquire more. If we do this, it will somehow make us worthy. In this paradigm, life is very conditional. There is always more to do, achieve, and acquire. Living this way can be exhausting. Most of us live with some level of shame because we will never measure up.

An aggressive tall ground cover, a plant that makes many people wonder why grow it in the first place, it stings indeed quite strongly - this is a favorite in a permaculture food forest! If planted in a well selected spot where it can spread without negatively affecting gardener's comfort, this plant produces heavily, grows without many demands and puts its incredible life force into dark green foliage that is ready to harvest in mid Spring.

Once they were in there new home with food and water it only took them about 1/2 hour to settle into their new surroundings. This whole time our cat Cleopatra was ignorantly sleeping in her bedroom… yes she has her own bedroom, and no that’s not weird, to us at least. When she finally did come down to the living room to join us she noticed them sitting on top of a decorative pillar that we have. She of course wanted to give them a good looking over and possibly a bit of a nibble, so we ended up putting them in our dressing room for the night for the peace of mind for everyone involved.

It’s just not practical for us to have a large yard while both of us hold full time jobs and I write as a second job. In reading Where Lilacs Still Bloom by Jane Kirkpatrick I wanted to feel the warm earth on my hands and see the satisfaction of work materialize as I watch the seeds take root and become something amazing. But I am not a gardener. I plant different kinds of seeds.

But it is necessary to expose the machinations of state assets if we are to save our movement. When this is all exposed to the public as what it is - state dirty tricks - the name of nationalism becomes clean and honourable again and will inspire the public to work to save their children. Then the public will see that the thuggery, the holocaust denial and the sexual perverts were put there by state ops showing that we have a clean and honourable party made up of decent and brave British patriots willing to make noble sacrifices for their country and their people at a time when we are being replaced in our communities by immigrants imported here by the elites. It is the duty of the writers and bloggers not only to expose this but to maintain morale and try to “find the way forward. We must support the brave and noble people who go out to talk to the general public, often put at risk in dangerous immigrant areas, because of the foul and false reputation placed on them by state assets. We are entering a new era requiring honour, nobility and heroism to create a future for our dispossessed children and our people.

This is a question that I have been asked many times, and I have always felt a bit stumped as to how to answer it comprehensively, as it seems there is not a clear-cut view on this. So, I have researched a bit and come up with the following viewpoints which I, for one, found quite enlightening, and I’m sure you will too.
As discussed, minimum medals to gain rewards will go from 3 to 1 to better reward those who are backfilled. Warzones will once again be shutting down when population imbalance is detected. This was an unfortunate bug where a feature of Ranked Warzones (in full team play it is not desirable to let one team end the game prematurely by quitting out) was incorrectly implemented globally.
However, the ghost of the Argentine conman hung over Vincenzo’s head, as the latter’s jingoistic lamentations were alleged to have distinctly commercial origins. It was speculated that Vincenzo stole the Mona Lisa at the insistence of de Valfierno, who only wanted the painting to disappear from the Louvre so as to convince his buyers that each of their individual Mona Lisas was an original.

Years ago I belonged to a computer knitting group that occasionally had a drawing to give away items in its “treasure chest.” These items were things that members of the list donated and consisted of yarn left over from projects, yarn the knitter decided she would never use, various knitting tools, etc. All in all it was a pretty nice treasure chest.

Today, many of these leaders display a Goldman Sachs culture quotient of exactly zero percent. I attend derivatives sales meetings where not one single minute is spent asking questions about how we can help clients. It’s purely about how we can make the most possible money off of them. If you were an alien from Mars and sat in on one of these meetings, you would believe that a client’s success or progress was not part of the thought process at all.

How to get a special sabbatical? Get yourself knocked up on purpose! Honestly, you could have either quit your job or booked yourself a 3 week trip to the Caribbean! If you’re a teacher (which one of them is), why would you take a “break” from dealing with kids, only to deal with one on your “break”? Doesn’t that defeat the purpose?
Pours thick, dark brown color, very cloudy in a weizen glass. Good brown head on it that is very strong. It smells of strong roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee grounds. I think there was some element of wheat beer smells (banana, estery), but it is simply overpowered by the bock smells. Taste, oh yeah, strong malt, very thick, with a slight hop on the aftertaste. VERY VERY drinkable, low carbonation, tailor made for guys like me. Excellent mouthfeel, which comes from the wheat, but not very bready. It just fills up your mouth completely and very smooth (nullus). Definetly not a session beer, though there are no traces of alcohol. To further characterize that malt, I would say it is almost maple syrupy, maybe a little fruity. But this beer as excellent balance. This is a beer that I think helps define why we do what we do. I am sitting here watching this boring debate, and all of an hour after drinking it down, I am craving it big time. But smartly I only chilled 2 of them (one for the wife). We will cellar some of it, and break it out on special occasions. 5 Stars, all day long.
Pension reform is the wrong solution. It is the wrong solution because the State of Illinois has a revenue problem; it is also transparent and unfair that the wealthy among us are not part of the solution. The vast accumulation and hoarding of wealth by the few while most people live modestly or impecuniously in comparison is abjectly wrong.
Now the other Lipgloss-blogger, Lipglossbitch has her 3 from 1 going on and this week, it's all about budget lipstick. Now I must confess that I am not sure what budget means deep down because really, all the cheap american brands cost a lot more over here (compared to what you guys pay) so in the end, it doesnt mean much. I guess one could call it drugstore-brands but I would have to pay just as much for a L'Oreal as I pay for my favorite brand Make up store.

But I would have to say that my favorite part of the whole event was simply hanging out with my colleagues, the other photographers who had also brought their work to be reviewed. Although we were from many countries, we shared a common language: our passion for photography. So while we waited in the lobby outside the hotel ballroom where the reviewers had their tables, we showed one another our prints and books, talked about how best to present them to the reviewers, offered ideas of other places to submit the work, and generally supported and celebrated one another. For four days and nights there was nothing in the world but us, our work, the subjects and causes we care so much about, our dreams and challenges, and our shared passion for photography. I saw such amazing portfolios and met such wonderful people!
The woman who ran the infantilist business was, at that time, the girlfriend of a now-deceased special effects man who worked on Hammer horror films. I knew him slightly. He was brought up in Kent and, as a child, used to dig up the skeletons of Napoleonic prisoners of war buried in the Kent marshes. He didn’t like his girlfriend to eat food in front of other people.

I believe in maintaining a healthy detachment from one's protagonists (main characters in written stories). You don't want to fall into the character too much but you also don't want to fall out of the character too much. You want to be so much a part of the character that you can feel the way he/she breathes, but in that very same heartbeat you want to be able to immediately detach yourself at any given time and say "That's her, this is me" or "That's him, this is me." The easiest way to do that is to use names not too closely associated with yourself but at the same time ones that are meaningful enough to mean something!

Joel also enlisted his half brother Justin’s help to highlight an international ministry. Justin Osteen is a medical doctor who spends much of the year in Africa to help the under-served. When the collection plates were passed to the crowd, they were encouraged to adopt a child in abstentia through monthly Champion of Hope donations through the Osteen Ministries. At least the pitch was less maudlin than Sally Struthers schtick.
This also gives it a more archaic, sonnety feel, which makes it funnier. I like the idea of some Elizabethan or Restoration poet thinking about S&M. It’s also less coarse than, say, John Wilmot, so it doesn’t call him so much to mind and thus retains it’s anachronistic humour.

Also, the report notes that economic recovery has generally been strongest where growth in government jobs, including military jobs, has been greatest, while the loss of government jobs has coincided with weak recoveries. Even the most indispensable government jobs must be paid for through taxation, and the dollars that are spent on these cannot be invested in new private-sector jobs, cannot be used to start new businesses, and cannot be saved. Is the dependence of the recovery upon tax dollars removed from the private economy a good long-term investment for the American taxpayer?

4- Grab your fabric paint. If you are using a textile medium like I did (which turns any craft paint into fabric paint) mix them according to the directions on the bottle. I chose to buy the textile medium because I already have a bunch of acrylic paint and that way I have lots of color options for any freezer paper stenciling I do in the future. I found the stuff I used at Joann's for $2.99. Don't forget your coupon!
But TYWLS also goes the extra mile — bringing in Cool Women with Hot Jobs (from Estee Lauder, Goldman Sachs and AT&T) to inspire the girls to dream big when it comes to potential career paths.

And every one of the 2,000 TYWLS girls, 74% of whom come from economically disadvantaged families, is encouraged to lead, work collaboratively, and strive for personal excellence.
The evenings at the Joker comedy club where we were lucky enough to have Ross as a compere, will probably be the funniest nights the club will ever see. All Ross ever needed was to see something and he'd be off - someone's T-shirt, a bit of décor in the room, a late comer sloping in, anything! - a springboard into the ad-libbed pool of comedy, each topic providing a link to yet another piece of on the spot improvisation. There was always a bit of scripted material in the back pocket for emergencies, but to be honest, it was rarely needed. If you've never seen him perform, don't go thinking that the guy must be a lazy good fer nuthin’ who can’t be bothered to write material. The stuff he creates live before your eyes is nothing short of stunning, and every single show he performs is totally unique. How scary must that be?! Walking out to deliver two hours of carefully crafted material is probably nerve-wracking enough, but walking out to ad lib for two or three hours??!

Straightening on shaky legs she picked the tail up, bent and twisted to the side she pressed the plug against her lips, which immediately opened and coated it with honey. Moaning at the touch she trembled again. Time was running out, she knew she needed to be ready. Taking a deep breath she spread herself and pushed the plug against her tight pouting ass. As the thickest part of it finally passed the tight ring of her pulsing ass she sighed and squirmed. In the mirror she was glad that her sight was dimmed, but glanced back yet again just the same, hoping to see the swirl of tail.

Well, guess what. I’m no David and this monster diabetes inside me sure isn’t Goliath. I took my blood sugar reading. Yikes! A whooping 237. Okay, okay, I’m thinking ain’t nothing but a thang. I ease into a pair of old white capris. It’s already warm at 9am. I slipped on a t-shirt given to me by a long ago co-worker. A young graphic designer running his own t-shirt business from out of his day job. He was a killer with Photoshop but punctuality, getting to the job on time, just wasn’t his forte. Point is I gear up all set to do battle with this monster. In my haste, instead of going to the park, I walk out my patio door and return to my old stumping ground.

Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, who died at the age of eighty-one in 1954, was, as far as Mme Thysse was concerned, the unsurpassed star of French prose, and by the end of the year I think she had persuaded us all. Colette would have belonged to Mme Thysse’s parents’ generation and, a Parisian herself, our teacher would make numerous, anecdotal asides about Paris during the Belle Epoque, during the First World War, and during the Nazi occupation. Fuelled with appropriate passages from Colette, those lessons were filled with images of Parisians dancing around kitchen tables in time to the rhythmic pounding of German guns, or hiding Jewish families in attics, or gleefully gathering up basketfuls of stunned fishes after Nazi bombs had exploded in the Seine.
“What’s wrong with your hand?” I look at Chanyeol’s precious hands. Now, I see his left wrist is covered with bandage. One thing I afraid is the return of his dark side. I admit that I don’t really care about anything happen around me. Except for Chanyeol, I can’t be careless about him.
Now the fun part, and the only reason this post is even remotely appropriate for a beer blog: you need one half empty can of beer for each chicken you're cooking. To be honest, it doesn't seem to matter too much what kind of beer you're using, so I suggest something that's good enough to drink, but not too expensive to waste half a can of inside a chicken's ass. I used Dales Pale ale from Oskar Blues. I don't think it's the best Pale Ale in a can, but it was on sale for a couple bucks less than Caldera. Now a lot of guys will tell you to slide the chicken down on the can and you're done. I like going a step further. Get a bullion cube, crush it up, and stick that in the can with the beer first. The idea is that the grill will get the temperature in the can hot enough to start boiling the liquid, which will steam the chicken from the inside, as well as flavor it a bit.

That would have to be Philip Marlowe. The first time I read the opening paragraph of The Big Sleep, it felt like coming home. Odd, really, because I’ve never been to LA. Generally speaking, I’m more a fan of standalones rather than series heroes, but I’ll be first in line if they ever discover an unpublished Marlowe manuscript.

Jose Rizal is the Philippines’ national hero. He was born on June 19, 1861 in Calamba City, Laguna. He was a novelist, a poet, an essayist, a correspondent, an ophthalmologist, and a diarist. He wrote two novels, the Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. He formed an organization named “La Liga Filipina”. He wrote these novels that inspired people, including Andres Bonifacio, to drive away the Spaniards that were in the country on that time. He died on December 30, 1896 by being executed by a Spanish firing squad in Bagumbayan, Manila. People erected monuments of him to remember him.

My husband and I had a very casual wedding reception to go to this weekend .. yep it was in a barn .. it was very low key! I went out to see if I could find a summer dress thinking they would all be on sale at this time of year .. well I didn't find a dress but I did find some nice tops.

People often attend plays, concerts, and other events. At these events the spectators only see what is on the outside. What is onstage. Some people are in amazement at what they see, others couldn’t be impressed. The fact is we do not know what is going on backstage, behind the scenes. Just like a contest to win a one-time free backstage pass to see a favorite performer or playwrite, HaShem did the same thing with The Jewish People. He went around to all the nations and asked them if they would like a “backstage pass” to the wisdom of creation, i.e., the Torah. The nations didn’t win the contest because of their decline in the offer.
Mercedes-Benz’s raced down the street, one following another to discharge their celebrity passengers and reporters who pranced from the car up the steps to the large blue door, to be greeted mid-way by a man with a shock of thick white hair and a long cashmere blue coat draped about his shoulders.

Alternate: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
Using miniature trees and a charge of dynamite, the Russian scholars reconstituted a great number of times in the laboratory the effects of an explosion comparable to that of 1908. By transposing the position of the trees obtained in this way onto the actual site, they were able to determine that the energy liberated in 1908 was the equivalent of ten megatonnes and, above all, that it could only have occurred in altitude. Which was also confirmed by a decisive fact: the systematic sounding of the marshy ground at the epicentre of the explosion and around it does not permit the discovery of the slightest parcel of meteorite rock. And for good reason… By studying the electrical fields registered at the arrival of the object and by grouping all of the testimonies of the inhabitants of the region, the scholars were able to determine that, before “exploding”, “the object” of the Tunguska had changed direction several times in flight. This singularity and the fact that no observation station throughout the world had registered the passage of a meteorite or a comet permits us to assure that the object which flew over the Central Siberian taiga on 30 June 1908 was a flying apparatus, of extra-terrestrial origin, piloted or teleguided by intelligent creatures.
2. Cowpuncher's Blues
I enjoyed this book. On the surface it’s nothing like his other books but that’s not a bad thing; different does not equal bad. It contains some gentle humour and is nowhere near a dry as it could have been. Much of the credit has to go the way the author has fleshed out his characters; they are real, vibrant (often eccentric) people but also real people. There’s a side to Edison—and Morgan even more so—that’s not very nice. Morgan starts off as a businessman and “It’s just business” could have been tattooed across his chest and yet we also get to see his human side too; at his heart he’s quite the tragic character. Edison, on the other hand, is forced into the position of becoming a businessman and it doesn’t suit him one bit. What humanises him are his relationships with his two hard put upon wives, Mary (who died in 1884 at the age of 29) and her replacement Mina (who he married in 1886 and who outlived him). He’s not the best husband in the world—what driven man could be?—but there is a genuine affection between them once they can get his attention. Most touching is the way they send each other messages in Morse code—both wives learned it. (Edison’s first two children to his first wife, Marion and Thomas, were nicknamed ‘Dot’ and ‘Dash’ by the way.)

“The house of evolution is falling. Its various theorists are increasingly at war with each other over the basic question of how evolution is supposed to work, and its materialistic and naturalistic foundation is becoming increasingly clear. The evolutionists tenaciously hold to their theory on the basis of faith and as an axiom of their worldview. The publication of these two articles in influential magazines indicates that proponents of evolution see the Intelligent Design movement as a real threat. They are right.” R.

Now, I have to admit that about a year ago, someone told me about a zombie romance and my first reaction was “Thanks, but no thanks.” Then, I decided to give Isaac Marion‘s Warm Bodies a go. The story is told from the perspective of R, a zombie who, try as he might, cannot remember much about his life before now. Then, he meets his (living) sweetheart. The book was a quick read, but one that proved in the end that Virgil may have had it right when he said, “Love conquers all things; let us too surrender to love.”

The AG dealt swiftly with the question as to whether any other form of copyright could be deployed to protect databases, concluding that they could not. In support of this he noted Recitals 3 and 12 to the Directive (these reflect the EU legislature’s intention that the directive completely harmonize the protection of databases by copyright so that further rights cannot be conferred at the national level) and Article 14 which establishes transitional arrangements for databases formerly protected by copyright under national rules which do not meet the requirements for copyright protection under the Directive. Such arrangements would make no sense, said the AG, if any ‘national’ rights were intended to continue.

IBM and the Holocaust is the stunning story of IBM’s strategic alliance with Nazi Germany — beginning in 1933 in the first weeks that Hitler came to power and continuing well into World War II. As the Third Reich embarked upon its plan of conquest and genocide, IBM and its subsidiaries helped create enabling technologies, step-by-step, from the identification and cataloging programs of the 1930s to the selections of the 1940s.

An eye for an eye is not the way of it anymore. Love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you, do these things fall absent in this case? It amazes me how so many can be so wrong. I am sad for my fellow Christians. I am sad for those who think that evil should be repaid with evil, and that hate brings about justice. I am sad for those who think that being against the death of a human being means you are anti-american, or misled, or stupid, or racist. I am sad that those like myself, are labeled as “anti-military” and that we “spit in the eyes of troops” when we say that we choose love over hate, life over death, and Christ over country.

Now, before I go off and be all productive, I would just like to point out last week wasn't a complete dead loss. You may or may not know, there is currently a tweetathon organised by the Society of Authors going on every Wednesday, in support of the short story. I already blogged about this here. Last week, I took part for the first time, and my line was selected to form part of the short, short story. You can see details of all the short stories, and more details about the tweetathon and the campaign by clicking here. If you have some time spare on Wednesday from 11am to 3pm UK time, please do take part. It's good fun, and an excellent way of promoting the short story.
Once you start thinking about what's going to happen next, you can start to capture the moment. Anticipation is key. Once you start to think about what's going to happen, where do I need to be, what do I need to do with my camera - that's when you start to get the photographs you want. Once you start thinking about it, these things get easy. Once you figure out where the pinnacle of the moment that's happening, you can catch them.

One of my school mates has a legion of friends on his Facebook account, most of whom he has never met in actual life. It seems bizarre to me how people now associate human existence to merely the email id! How do you know that an online contact is genuine or just trying to be more sociable by hiding behind his cyber personality? The institution of marriage too is slowly losing its bathos and being organized like a business deal over online matrimonial sites. Social networking apparently is bringing the world closer but is this the real world or just the microcosm confined to our computer screens? People are being drawn apart as they seldom meet face to face. If they do, who will use the Skype account?

She storms out – but not before breaking a vase. I loved this little temper tantrum!

Why do I ask? Well, I suppose I would consider myself a bibliophile, but I have my specifications. That is, I love books, but I don’t love all books. I love the books that I love, and that’s that. I enjoy the writings of certain authors in certain genres and pretty much keep my focus there. There are other genres that, consequently, I simply have no interest in, and haven’t read (nor plan to read) anything therein. For example, I have no penchant for reading most non-fictional works. I don’t care about basket weaving, crochet, American History, guns, or works on the sociopolitical climate of the Middle East or Latin America. With regard to fiction, I have a higher tolerance, although I don’t read romance, most works with gender or race undertones or allegories, or anything, you know, boring.

We used rope as guidelines to get straight rows but if you visit the farm you’ll see that one of us still managed to make completely crooked rows (ha!).

My friend Debbie gave me a Christmas gift that touched me deeply. It was just a picture frame really, nothing special, except for the message it contained. Before I opened it, Deb said, “I saw this and immediately thought of you.” Engraved on the frame was the phrase “Blessed are the Happiness Makers.” Deb and I met just weeks after Mom died; DH and I were at Ted’s one night when Debbie and her husband walked in, saw that there were no open tables, looked at me, pulled up a chair and said, “You’re cute, and I want to meet you. Can we sit with you?” A much needed new friend sent by an angel above. Blessed are the Happiness Makers. Through all this, from this loss, I have made happiness…better than a banana eating a bowl of cereal on top of a school bus happiness. Thank you, Mom, for that most important of lessons.

Two repeated phrases reinforce the complexity of Kanye’s sophisticated relationship with himself and those who love and hate him. The first is the refrain, borrowed from King Crimson’s titular song, ’21st Century Schizoid Man’. Like Mersault, who is torn between societal norms and his, albeit largely unexplored, indifference towards the world of human affairs, Kanye is ‘schizoid’, a divided self. The song explores this division as one between the private and the public self, between his natural creativity and the pressures of fame, between his younger more authentic persona and the new one, ostensibly undermined by celebrity. Taken with ‘All of the Lights’, which follows ‘Power’ on the album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and forms with it something of a musical diptych, Kanye laments the extent to which fame has changed him and in doing so has driven his family away.

This season also introduced Spike, and did great things with him, I'd say. I'd been enjoying Buffy up to his appearance, but the scene where he so casually disposed of the Anointed One was the first moment where I felt that I was watching something truly special. Restoring Drusilla to "health" (whatever exactly that means for a vampire--obviously not mental health) cost him the use of his legs, and I loved how bitterly ironic that became when she started gravitating away from him toward Angelus, in part because of the latter's non-impairment and--even worse--his cruel stream of wheelchair jokes! Spike's savage (however relatively insignificant) beating of Angelus in the finale was a satisfying and well-earned character payoff.

While the majority of the OWS crowd may just be a bunch of whiny, self entitled, think the world owes them somethings, shit draws flies, and OWS is responsible for any acts of violence, terrorism, and crime that results from their rhetoric. Normally I'd just clown on these clowns for a couple of paragraphs, but I'm in a transitional period, and I'm here to help. So listen up OWS, There is no utopia, the world doesn't owe you dick, nada, zip, zilch. If you don't want 150 k in student loan debt for your worthless degree in the Arts or whatever bullshit you studied in between bangin patchouli oil laden hairy pitted hippy broads with a single name like Moonbeam or Azure, then try going to a community college and earning a sensible degree that is actually worth something.

I didn't do that this Sunday morning. The thought (and this, I swear, is historic) never occurred. Because I had gone to sleep reading Buzz Bissinger's Father's Day, and, on waking, I was so wild in my want to finish the book that habit had no power over me. Subtitled A Journey Into the Mind & Heart of My Extraordinary Son, Buzz's book is a memoir about fatherhood and about a trip he took with his adult son, a second-born twin named Zach. Read the flap copy and you'll know why the story—about not wanting and getting, about bewilderment and exhilaration, about doing wrong and being wronged and loving hard and forever—should be important. Read the book to find out why it (absolutely, you-can't-deny-me-this) is.

This was a surprise free gift included by Wahat Aljalabiya. The gems also look sort of silvery in the picture but they’re actually sort of a reflective black. The choker design is pretty neat, I have not seen one like this in the stores here. It is a flexible wire so it would be comfortable on any size neck and is easy to adjust and take on and off, and it does not actually feel at all constrictive or tight on the neck.

“The way it should work, and the way it works for most in the state of Illinois, is that whoever hires the employees should pay the pension,” said Illinois Public Policy Institute’s John Tillman. “Schools outside of Chicago are getting a free ride on the backs of taxpayers by having the state pay for their pensions.”
There is a large hand painted ginkgo fused in the center right area of the collage. Maybe 5 years ago my neighbor Rhonda, gave me a ginkgo leaf this size that she found when she was at the library. I cut this hand painted fabric leaf out immediately, but it never found a home, so here it is. This is why these collages are so much fun.
Anyway, I was stretching the other day and a sudden thought hit me. “Why am I doing this? Why? Why am I exercising to a point that my muscles hurt the next day?
The Canada that existed prior to WWII was much different from the post-war Canada. There is no denying that Mackay was a traitor to his people. That is not the issue. It is recognition of the disproportionate involvement of Jewish interest groups who coordinated a full scale press against the Anglo/Franco host population, on humanitarian grounds. The S v K decision allowed blacks to move into white neighborhoods in St. Louis. The result is that St. Louis is now one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S.

...watched some break-dancing. We sat opposite Shakespeare’s Globe theatre and were treated to a fab impromptu display from four guys and a girl, all throwing athletic shapes and spinning arms over legs on the dusty concrete floor. We clapped and we cheered; we threw money in the hat and marvelled at folk who go out dancing wearing a crash-helmet. I mean, you’ve got to be seriously committed to doing a head-twirl; it’s a tricky style look to pull off, otherwise.

As we saw earlier. the verb construction for πληροῦσθε, which is translated in Ephesians 5:18 as “be filled,” is present tense, imperative mood, passive voice. The present tense shows a continuing action which is designed to be a continuing reality. Here is the last part of v18 from the Greek, “πληροῦσθε ἐν Πνεύματι.” With the verb structure clearly in mind, a literal translation of this would be, “Be being filled in Spirit.” This tells us that we are to be in a constant state of being filled with the Spirit.

O love of my God, which as much exceeds our love as you Lord excel us! you witness it by dying for us, not only once, but daily dying mystically on our altars. Give me a gratitude as ample as these benefits. Take from me what is mine, and odious, and give me what belongs to you. Give me an upright heart, and a will conformable to yours, and in all my thoughts, words, and actions, let me have no other aim but your will and greater glory.

But wait there is more waiting if you are an artist! It is what we do with that “wait time” when we are creatively working that is important. When an artist has down time, time in which we have to wait for something to dry, wait for something to stick together, wait for something to cure, melt, mold, bake, even sell… we need to also occupy that time to be productive. And guess what? An artist usually fills their wait time with something that takes even more time to wait for, right?

I piled up about 2.5kg of lumpwood charcoal into my Weber chimney starter and let if take off for a bit whilst I sorted out all the ingredients. This gave me 20 minutes or so to season and skewer the chicken, skewer the spuds and swedes, wrap up the garlic bread and chop up the vegies for the ratatoullie.
I met Scott Walker and his brother Landon at a Suzuki Workshop where he was teaching cello master classes and fiddle group classes. His immediate connection with both my kids impressed me -- his gleefulness, his sense of fun, and his ability to work with Benny immediately and effectively, and charm the socks off Sadie -- I was impressed. During the faculty concert, Scott and Landon played a song together that is without a doubt one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've heard played on the cello. When I found that Scott had written the song, I knew that I had to get my kids more time with these people, so I began to look into their summer camp.
But it's still a pretty fucking awesome gift, under the circumstances.
A medical device firm, for instance, can claim a credit for the money it pays to a contract manufacturer that makes the prototypes and the labs that tests the devices. It can also receive a credit for fees it pays to intellectual property lawyers to obtain a patent, even if they’re unsuccessful.
Once your felt circles are cut, fold a circle in half. Cut 2 slits at the fold in the center, about 1/4"-1/2" long and leaving about 1/4" of room between the slits. Cut 1 foot of the yarn you used to wrap the wreath, for each flower you want to make. Thread the yarn through the slits of each of the 8 pieces of felt that make up a flower. Once all are threaded, tie a tight knot at the base & leave the tails as you will use them to attach the flowers to the wreath. Arrange the felt nicely to make the flower.

The news of Brown's stabbing traveled like wildfire, as did the news of Willie Earle's arrest. The nexus of unrest was the Yellow Cab office on West Court Street, where Greenville's taxi drivers had congregated in an angry pack, and started passing around a bottle of whiskey.
Many people don't accept these things, but they are powerless. The national political class may yet discover what people are capable of when they feel they have no other option. We are heading for either civil war or repression on a near-totalitarian scale. The only alternative is an agreed-on set of rules whereby states or other jurisdictions can peacefully and legally detach themselves from what they deem intolerable.

All’s well that ends well, I suppose. But that’s not the point! The purpose of extreme couponing is to save money while providing for one’s family and community. To become a better and more responsible steward of one’s financial resources in order to maximize quality time with loved ones. And I had ultimately failed at doing so by wasting precious time with my son and neglecting to pay a basic utility bill.

When my train trundled into York station, I enjoyed my first walk through town and stopped and watched traffic entering and exiting the bar, which means gate for the Vikings who once called this city home.

Pull the dough out of the fridge and roll a small amount of dough (about a tablespoon) around each kiss. I like to smoosh the dough just a bit in my palm, stick the kiss in point first, then wrap it around. You have to smoosh it a little to hide the kiss completely.
This reminds me of a post I wrote a while back in reaction to the death of Amy Winehouse. I only occasionally listen to her music and probably wouldn't have written a post on it, but I was absolutely shocked to see her mother quoted as saying, "It was only a matter of time." Even disregarding that, the general attitude at the time seemed to be that she deserved it.
*Your local Parks and Recreation service likely offers classes with topics ranging from flower arranging to genaeolgy. Not every class they offer will be free, but the prices for these classes will be lower than what you would pay to a normal instructor. Let your kids look through their flyer at the beginning of the school year and pick something special and new they want to learn, or perhaps to find a class on a skill they want to perfect, such as photography. Give them opportunities to "earn" the fee by doing jobs around the house. This frees up your time, potentially saves you money, and they will appreciate the class all that much more having earned it.

Since then Ashley has had a couple similar incidents with a Sprite and a cupcake, but at least I can now look at her and tell that things aren't right. She gets pale,slightly green and sweaty. Honestly, I am at a loss on what to do for her. Her fasting blood sugar is elevated, but not enough to qualify as full blown diabetes. Her post-prandial numbers are high, but not high enough to fall into the diabetic range. She runs almost everyday and if she doesn't run it is because she has been walking the streets for hours trying to sell Girl Scout cookies (of which she has only had one this year). Some days I think she is ok so I let her eat a cupcake at a birthday party and she gets sick and feels miserable. Other days she is fine.
In fact, other countries like Britain are already experimenting with this kind of legislation, such as mandating public schools inject pro-homosexual content into every aspect to UN-educate the public (IGNORANCE is Bliss).
In other words, if I understand him at all, Lanza is saying that there is an endless series of moments of observation. These moments are independent and featureless, until our minds process them into what we conceptualize as things and events. The way our minds do this is to create an inner matrix of observations, stitched together in our minds by the purely mental categories we call “space” and “time.” There are no things, there are no events, there is no space, there is no time. There are observations. Our minds create all of the other things when they process those observations.
Inspiring and flavorful ingredients can turn a blah salad into something so much more. Olives and olive oil add a whole new taste dimension to your basic salad, not to mention the bonus of heart-health benefits they provide.

I LOVE salads, olives and olive oil, so I was so excited when the International Olive Council contacted me about posting about their new Add Some Life campaign!

I wanted to read novels using the E ink screen, and then I wanted to look at ebooks with colored material using an LCD screen. If I had the technical know-how to create this invention, I would tinker away in my garage and become the next techie genius, but I don’t. So I just wanted to give a shout out to all the inventors in the world. Hey I have an idea, anyone interested to make it real? Is this even possible? Let me know, and I’ll be the first one to buy your new invention.

I engaged on this topic reluctantly. Principally because the parent-child-teaching method model is so individual & one shouldn't meddle. But also because, as a homeschooling dad, I've found it really difficult to communicate, on homeschooling; because I have fairly radical ideas, and with mothers; because my communication style is fairly, some would say masculine. You know if someone, in everyday life, asks me a question I'll answer it. But I've found this approach often gets me into trouble, so I try to avoid these types of discussions.
But yes I heard about such an emergency exit. I asked some friends about it, they as well heard about it, but couldn’t help me further. Only this year in 2012 I found finally someone who actually went with me. This was good because finding the entrance to the emergency exit out of the big city isn’t that easy.
Lately my posts here have been informational in nature (..the DBT Skills). Sometimes I find I present myself as someone who has it together. I feel like a fraud. Sometimes I do feel like I am doing well, and I am genuinely “holding my own,” but that is really a small portion of the time. Lots of times it’s just a front. Not for you. Not for other people. But for me. Because I have a really hard time facing my own vulnerabilities. I have a hard time being true to myself. Vulnerability is a hard thing.
Have you ever found yourself guiltily plucking thin air whilst listening to the intro to Smoke on the Water? If this is the case, perhaps you should think about adding yourself to the list of competitors for this Sunday’s Air Guitar champion of Paris event!

I have often heard that working remotely – away from the office causes people to be more productive. Well there is new research in and it suggests that this is not always the case. Apparently when the task depends on creativity, productivity goes up in a less structured environment but the reverse is also true. So next time you need to accomplish some real creative stuff set yourself up in a really cool environment but to get those routine mind numbing tasks done better stay at the office.
Now add in the beaten egg and mix well and cook for some more time...
My request to meet ‘The Boy’ before I moved to a new city went unanswered. I wanted to meet him to talk about my book, considering it dealt mostly with how our relationship had a profound emotional and psychological effect on me. He read some of the words I wrote about him and seemed accepting and pleased at how I had described his soul and essence. After reading, he assured me I could write what I wanted as long as he was sufficiently unidentifiable as a character. With the first draft completed, I wanted to talk to him before I left to embark on my new life. In ways, I wanted his buy-in to my endeavors, to have him involved so that I could keep the story as undiluted as possible and to ensure he was comfortable with some of the darker aspects which were essential to the integrity of the story. ‘The Boy’ is a unique spirit; dark, brooding, intense, emotional and complex and I wanted to do his personality justice. Everything about him was relevant to the story and I wanted his support.
To this day I cannot say “why”…I have no idea why God would have cared about me…but the lostness and deadness and sin in my life had finally brought me to this place, and it was then, that God intervened in my life. You see, He had a purpose for me–a higher calling than living for me. And little did I know, His plan to rescue me–to bring me out of death and into life–was about to be stepped up a notch.

By now the rumble of the Manhattan bound F-Train was right below Louie’s feet. Not liking the feel of the sidewalk vibrating beneath his soles, Louie squashed the cigar against the red brick wall outside the luncheonette, leaving another tell tale black mark along with thousands of other cigars he squashed. He then made his way back inside and sat on his favorite chrome stool, his cup of warm coffee was still there untouched by the counter.
The Bible, rather than being a single document, is really a collection of ancient texts, written and compiled by an unknown number of authors over thousands of years, and many times these authors and editors disagreed with each other, creating tensions, contradictions and conversations within the scriptures. To me, this is in no way inconsistent with the patience and mercy of a God who would set in motion his plan on Jan. 1 and wait all year to see it fulfilled. He is a God of evolution, of gradual change, of conversation and dialogue, of seeking and finding.
Ironically, if we look through the Bible we see the ones God chose to do big things for His kingdom were not just those that strived to follow God, they were also the sinners. Rahab, a harlot, helped Joshua and his soldiers hide as the prepared to capture they city of Jericho. King David had an affair with Bathsheba, got her pregnant and had her husband killed and yet he was considered to be a man after God’s own heart. We see that He can take any situation and turn it around for His glory. I believe the greatest testimonies are built on those that God has restored.

Poll methodology varies, but currently the support for the long-suffering KKE, the Communist Party of Greece, an old Soviet style Marxist party, prominent in the protest movement and known for denying the true scale of Stalin’s atrocities is running at around 10%. SYRIZA, the Coalition of the Radical Left, and the democratic socialist party DIMAR, the Democratic Left, are both recording similar results. That gives anti-austerity leftist parties, before the crisis either non-existent or with only fringe support, with a level of support that rivals the mainstream coalition.
Looking at the chart before you, it’s hard to imagine how I can claim there is a racial silence on indigenous people when indios/indígenas acocunt for a (sometimes extremely) significant portion of the individuals marked in the censuses. Except that, from 1789 onward in particular, super majorities of those entries were for unnamed indigenous tributaries delinquent in paying their head tax. (After Independence, tribute suffered a long drawn out death worthy of PeeWee at the end of Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie. The tax went by various names, but was most often referred to as the contribución personal from the 1830s through its end in 1857.) Indigenous arrests were most likely NOT to be related to tribute in the period 1767-1769, which coincided with the period of the restoration of royal authority after the Rebellion of the Barrios.
It’s one thing to ask for a $25, $50 or $100 donation, but to ask for farmland, crops, IRAs and more!?! This kind of target marketing isn’t just disgusting, it is simply outrageous!

John Wesley died on the 2nd March 1791. On horseback, preaching two or three times a day. He was well travelled. It is said he rode 250,000 miles, gave away 30,000 pounds and preached more than 40,000 sermons. In one of his famous sermons he exclaimed:
Since the end of World War Two, Britain’s towns and cities have been transformed for the benefit of local councils and commerce. Grievous damage was done by Luftwaffe bombs, but the Nazis were outdone in gratuitous destruction by postwar urban planners.

The second book is more ambitious and in some ways more satisfying, being rooted in all-too-readily imaginable reality: The Submission by Amy Waldman reconstructs the process of choosing the 9/11 memorial for the site of the Twin Towers but imagines a scenario where the winning design, chosen anonymously from thousands of submissions, was created by a Muslim architect. Before the selection has been announced to the public, the selection committee is torn apart by the resulting conflict. The book was written before the controversy about the proposed Muslim cultural centre at Ground Zero, but eerily foreshadows it. The characters are complex, and beautifully drawn with their frustratingly dogmatic thoughts and opinions, never quite behaving the way they should, and never quite making the matter an easy one.
Future students of American history will be scratching their heads about this case for decades to come. Our embargo and refusal to normalize diplomatic relations has nothing to do with communism. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have had diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, with China since Nixon, and with Vietnam despite our bitter war there. No, Cuba was pure politics. Though it started out to be a measure of an administration’s resistance to Castro’s politics, it very soon became a straight-jacket whereby first-generation Cuban-Americans wielded inordinate political power over both parties and constructed a veto over rational, mature diplomacy.

I began with down-stays--one in the morning while we ate breakfast; one in the evening as we watched TV. These take effort on the part of the trainer as well as the dog, since one absolutely must get up and put the dog back in its place every time it gets up. Also, every time he wanted to be let out I would make him sit and I would wait by the open door, letting the cold rush into the house, for as long as it took him to stop sniffing the great outdoors and look at me, whereupon I would release him. Every single time.

The same paradigm operates whether parents are supervising live or on-line behavior. One of our sons was spending a weekend away, attending the celebration of a friend’s bar mitzvah that we weren’t close enough to the family to be included. We told him directly that although we would not be there, we had asked adult friends who would to “keep an eye” on him, and report back to us. Not telling him in advance would have constituted spying. Being clear about our expectations of him, and what we had put in place to be certain we fulfill our parenting responsibilities lets everyone understand that our care, concern and supervision is important enough to continue, even when we can not be present. When that same son begged for text messaging on his phone, we agreed only after explaining that we would be checking the monthly bills to guarantee that no texting was occurring during school hours. And we did check, and thanked him regularly for his responsible use of technology.

I can’t expect that to happen every week though! I know we make our own opportunities really and if I want to reach my ideal of being self-employed then I need to get off my backside and approach galleries myself, and maybe get good at talking to people in real life! It’s scary but I can’t just let the weeks fly by while I while away the hours being cosily domestic, only producing ceramics when occasion demands it – I need to take some chances.

Ah, but of course I do have a point to make (there's a shock) and that's concerning the cover design on Started Early, Took My Dog. Now, as a rule, I'm not overly keen on contemporary cover design, at least not that which graces (disgraces?) novel dustjackets. The form for designers seems to be: find a nice font; alight on a vaguely relevant/failing-that-moody image of a person/house/if-all-else-fails-tree from an image library (which can lead to amusing duplication; The Rap Sheet has lots of examples of the same pics popping up on different covers); bung on a texture; job done. (The jacket for Case Histories is all about that unusual illustration, although I guess it at least displays a mind at work in the picking of that illo.) Truly distinctive or memorable jackets are few and far between, and cases are an afterthought, if that.
In a review in the Guardian, Jane Smiley is utterly puzzled by the novel, and seems somewhat horrified by its casual violence. Perhaps that's not surprising as her bloodless books are almost the opposite of the carefree romp you find here. Yet it's surprising, amongst the welter of good reviews for this year's Booker list to find this negative one for what, to me, is by far the best of the bunch I've read so far.

Seeing as the race of the seven thugs hasn't been mentioned (apart from one photo), its safe to assume that they are all African-American. White bashing has become a national sport in America, committed by gangs of Blacks - male and female - and done with the intent to either hurt the White's severely or to kill them. Since Mr Hope 'n Changie came into office, this Black thuggery seems to have gotten worse. It's almost as if they've decided to drop the facade of trying to be a civilised race and in turn unleashed their inner savage. Or, maybe it's just that people are starting to report this behavior more and more? In any case, another young White man is fighting for his life, all because he wanted to help his fellow man. The criminals? Well, they range in age from 14 - 17 years of age, with 2 of the 7 being female. My, what fine, upstanding citizens liberal America is producing! You could almost close your eyes and be back in sub-Saharan Africa.....
The author’s confident assertion in the midst of political turmoil is founded upon the Ancient Near Eastern concept of divine sonship where the King was somehow connected to a deity. Historians usually distinguish between sonship in Egypt and the rest of the ancient Mediterranean world. Ancient Egyptians, it is said, believed in a literal/physical relationship between a deity and the Pharaoh where, “The Pharaoh is Deus incarnates…The god Amon has begotten him with the queen mother.”[3] Mesopotamians, on the other hand, held to a kind of adoptionism. Kraus says, “Contrary to that [i.e. Egyptian mythology], in Babylonia and Assyria the king is most often understood to be a servant called, installed, and empowered through a ‘statement’ by the gods.”[4] We should exercise caution and restraint in asserting such broad generalizations for either position. According to Jarl Fossum, while literal/physical sonship was portrayed in Egypt, “The enthronement was the definitive act of begetting or deification in Egypt too.”[5] Likewise, while Mesopotamians held to a form of divine appointment, Fossum suggests that there are hints of literal/physical sonship amidst their mythology, “Beginning with the Sumerian king Mesilim of Kish, the Mesopotamian ruler was seen as the ‘son’ or ‘child’ of his god or goddess. The king is said expressly to have been ‘born’ of the deity, and we should obviously understand his sonship in physical terms.”[6] We should exercise this same sense of balance as we strive to understand Ancient Israel’s view of divine sonship.
So there you have it, friends: London After Midnight -- a Halloween treat with a trick. If you've seen 1935's Mark of the Vampire, the twist came as no surprise to you; for that matter, even in 1927 the New York Times commented that whether the ending surprised anyone would be "a matter of opinion."

The examples above that my friends provided were thought-provoking, and it wasn’t obvious to me what the answer should be. Like I said, free speech is a difficult issue. So I did some research.

This is false. The Forward has confused the number of cases we know about with the number of cases that actually occured. For example, it appears to have been unaware of the two Rockland County cases reported by ABC last night. And the Forward also seems to be unaware that there is no mandatory reporting of HSV-1 in New Jersey. Therefore it is impossible to claim that there have been a finite number of cases, “between 10 and 15″ admitted to hospitals in the United States, Israel and Canada in “well over a decade.”

A.

Few groups were hit harder by the recession than young men… The unemployment rate for males between 25 and 34 years old with high-school diplomas is 14.4%—up from 6.1% before the downturn four years ago and far above today’s 9% national rate. The picture is even more bleak for slightly younger men: 22.4% for high-school graduates 20 to 24 years old. That’s up from 10.4% four years ago.
Matters more that I know the solution.

I first met Andy when I was home for the summer after my freshman year of college. I was in a new place, didn't know anyone, so I was hanging out with my sister and her high school pals. He was nearby with a group of friends not in their clique; I have no memory of why we started talking, but we did and exchanged phone numbers. We had similar taste in music and in movies, but that's as far as it went. He was crazy for antique cars, performed in karate competitions, and talked up his experiences as the star of his HS distance cycling team. He was charming, charismatic, and came from new money; his father had built a local empire and his son got the spoils. There were certain personality issues that made it a summer romance and not a long-term one, in my mind: he was extremely anti-social, for one thing. He discouraged hanging out with his friends (bunch of "jerks") and had no interest in meeting the few I had—didn't want to "share me" on our dates. He never introduced me to his parents (we entered through his "wing" of his house without disturbing anyone) and when he came to take me on a date, he would honk from the driveway rather than make small talk with mine. This drove my parents to dislike him intensely.
Roxanne Green was my elementary school bully. She was only a year or two older but she had a face, I recall, that was somewhat resemblant to that of a haggard old man’s. She had a curly mop of wiry, dark brown hair that always reminded me a little of a brillo pad, and these cruel, beady little black eyes (I don’t know if they were actually black or if my mind is inventing details to fill in the gaps left by time) that had an almost piggish quality about them. She was easily mistaken for a boy at even the slightest distance, and she was – as most bullies are – mean.

She bullies "The Bugs" to no end. And to Bugsy's dismay, she enjoys making friends (human and canine). You may remember that Bugsy hates everyone. Violet is the exact opposite. She loves nearly everyone, but be careful, she's very aggressive with her love. Her kisses land right on the lips every time no matter how you try to maneuver her--it's a gift.
I sat very still and then I heard the small voice. …and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. (Phil 4:7).

Yes, I know that Google, Facebook, and likely countless other online companies are regularly scooping up information on every key stroke. Yes, I know that unlike those genuinely progressive Western countries, our little backwater nation does not require companies to tell the citizenry what information they are gathering about us.

And yes, I think that there is some price to pay for “free” e-mail, “free” searches, “free” social networking.

Ok, maybe I’m being a little dramatic but the possibility the town could be a giant fireball by morning is high. April 30th is known as “Maienstecken” here in Germany. Also known as the “Witches Night.” Halloween sound familiar?? What does this mean? It basically means to take/hide/move things. There is no literal translation but the meaning is that the children (ages from 7-18 approximately) get together and go around their town causing chaos hidden under the dark blanket of the night sky.
Moving is expensive. Adding expenses for deposits, hookups, new installations, etc., makes it more expensive. You can make life easier by relocating existing basic services where possible.
Anyways, the civilized are making sure, by destroying so much of the Earth's ecosystems, depleting and toxifying and irradiating the soil everywhere they go, that they won't ever be able to do anything that resembles agriculture as there won't be any soil left to do it.

Me, well, I've been busy. The Amish Furniture Store keeps me very busy. I seem to be in charge of at least 11 different departments in this business, and never seem to have a dull day. 3 weeks ago, I chipped a part of one of my molars off. I was disgusted to learn that my only option for fixing this tooth, was a root canal followed by a crown. My appointment for my root canal was last Wednesday, but I still don't have a root canal because as soon as they numbed my mouth up, I passed out and the endodontist wouldn't do the root canal. So, I'll be heading back there tomorrow high on some valium.... Hoping this attempt has the outcome that I need.

Of course he thinks this: only his party is backed by the rich; he doesn’t need public subsidies, like the Greens do. Harper thinks the Canada Health Act – the very thing Obama has been pointing to as he’s worked for a more universal health care system across the border – should be scrapped. Health care shouldn’t be a Federal bother, you see; he also thinks we should pay for it privately. Have none of you seen what’s been going on for decades in the States?

In other words, if you want to reduce stress – and possibly improve your time management, your to do list should be super short.

Okay.

In recent decades the Coptic Pope has been considered the top-ranking member of the Oriental Orthodox communion, a somewhat ad hoc group of churches that does not form a clade but which is united by a reluctance to accept the conclusions of the Council of Chalcedon of 451 AD. It's a long story; let's just say that it had something to do with the vexed question of precisely how Christ could be both God and man. It was to the fifth century church what the argument over gay clergy is to the 21st: divisive, unresolveable and ultimately a bit daft. About twenty years ago a high-powered group of theologians came up with a form of words that seemed to satisfy everybody (except the few remaining Nestorians). But the fifteen hundred odd years of mutual anathemas should stand as a warning to anyone who thinks that the current rows over sexuality and gender will be patched up any time soon.

In stark contrast to easy and detached slactivism, PAIR offers its volunteers a first-hand look into how progress can occur. Every session is a training ground for how we, as PAIR volunteers and officers, can improve. We are bonded through the common joys and challenges of working with this special group of students. As we strengthen our relationships with our students, our lives are slowly changed to reflect more selflessness and more compassion. When a PAIR volunteer becomes an officer, it is an eye-opening process, to say the least. They are challenged in every way, from working together on a team to becoming a point person for an entire session day. As president of the Rice PAIR chapter, I have seen officers grow into dedicated, passionate individuals that stop at nothing to ensure the refugee youth we serve have fun and educational programming.
