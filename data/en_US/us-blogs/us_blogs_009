The suspension means that employers who have workers coming up to their term limit at the end of this year may now apply for a two-year term limit exemption work permit, buying the employee another two years on-island. It is hoped that this two-year breathing space will allow immigration experts looking into the Immigration Law to make changes for the good of Cayman and its economy as a whole.

Who doesn’t have an old cardboard box around home? You, know the kind made with brown corrugated cardboard. Rip up a side into palm sized pieces, make a nest in the bottom of the ‘barbie’ (no, not the doll, your daughter would have a fit – it’s Australian and NZ slang for a BBQ), put on some smaller choice pieces of charcoal, and light. Then feed on bigger bits of charcoal. Simple.

Son of Daedalus who dared to fly too near the sun on wings of feathers and wax. Daedalus had been imprisoned by King Minos of Crete within the walls of his own invention, the Labyrinth. But the great craftsman’s genius would not suffer captivity. He made two pairs of wings by adhering feathers to a wooden frame with wax. Giving one pair to his son, he cautioned him that flying too near the sun would cause the wax to melt. But Icarus became ecstatic with the ability to fly and forgot his father’s warning. The feathers came loose and Icarus plunged to his death in the sea.

When you get right down to it, the main thing a zombie movie has going for it is the built-in fear of these slow, lumbering decayed bodies coming towards you to eat your brains while while you just stand there like an idiot. Oh, and if there's time, subtle subtext and artistic pretension.
The Avengers weren't the first... as in a superhero team movie. The X-Men franchise and the Watchmen movie had glimmers of this concept perculating throughout their various tales. However, the Avengers cemented how diverge heroes can unite for a common cause with nothing bonding them save for equal parts tenacity and talent. Not a mutant-tie nor a mystery-tie... but the true tie that binds... heroism in the face on indominable odds. While we can dream that Charlton's Action-Heroes and Archie's Mighty Crusaders may someday grace the silver screen with their presence, nothing can match what transpired when Marvel Comics' Sensational Sextet saved their world!

This next pick comes half from nostalgia and half from it actually being an entertaining adventure with tons of magic despite some dated TV special effects. This next pick comes from the BBC miniseries of C.S. Lewis’s “The Chronicles of Narnia” (1988-1990), specifically “The Silver Chair.” “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe” and “Prince Caspian” were OK (and I still argue have more magic than the most recent theatrical incarnations), but for me the adventure didn’t really start until Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace were sucked into that painting and went on that quest in “The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” (1989). The Dawn Treader sails the high seas, its crew—made up of an adult Prince Caspian and Warwick Davis in full mouse costume as Reepicheep—on a mission to find the seven missing lords of Narnia, welcomes the former royalty of Lucy and Edmund. The voyage takes them to several different magical islands. They meet strange civilizations, nasty despots and slavers, whimsical wizards, monsters, dangerous relics, and even have Eustace turn into a dragon (one of the highlights). The salty sea air, funny clothes, odd creatures, and fun characters make this a memorable fantasy adventure epic. The last part of the BBC “Narnia” series (and I say, the best) was “The Silver Chair” and is also a great quest story. Eustace and Jill wind up in Narnia and must team up with Puddleglum the Marshwiggle (Tom “Dr. Who” Baker) to find the old and dying Prince Caspian’s lost son, Rillian. Their quest takes them through forests and fields, flights atop giant owls, to cities full of giants, and deep under ground where they are confronted by unspeakable evil. Though some of the acting is clunky and the costumes funny and you can see the seams in many of the special effects, “The Silver Chair” is a great adaptation from the Lewis novel. Tom Baker (“Dr. Who”!) holds most of the film together as the pessimistic, but wise, buffoonish guide character. Another thing that makes “The Silver Chair” particularly memorable is newcomer Jill’s struggle to remember Aslan’s words amidst all the new unfamiliar and dangerous settings. Giants may be looking to cook them, and subterranean civilizations may be looking to take them captive, and an evil witch may be desiring to make them forget everything, and Prince Rillian may not even want saving, but the quest is always grounded by the three main characters. Loaded with magic, adventure, and fascinating Christian symbolism, “Silver Chair” makes another great addition to the genre.

First, let me start with a vision I always had of myself as the artist. It’s late at night, and I sit at an antique oak desk in front of a Royal manual typewriter. A cigarette dangles from my lips as smoke curls around my head. To my right, sits an amber-filled tumbler and to my left a filled ashtray. I sit typing madly away at the next great American novel oblivious to the late hour and the ash building on the end of my fag. This vision was in my head even before I acknowledged myself as a writer. When I finally made the leap nearly 14 years ago and actually said the words, “I am a writer,” the vision was still there although not a part of my actual reality as a writer.

I went out with some girlfriends last night. It was another reminder that the Universe is listening to me, even if I'm not asking the questions out loud. They told me about the true meaning of friendship, they told me how they understand my feelings, they told me that they do not and would not judge me...they told me I had a safe place to go. I don't think there are words to express how much I really really needed to hear that. I am grateful for each of those ladies...

Sometimes or a lot of times, we shop when we’re bored and that’s always a dangerous thing. Been there, done that ... a lot! More often than I care to admit. When we shop like that, we’re often trying to fill an emptiness that lives deep inside of us. We rarely recognize it as emptiness but it's a real void, a void we try to fill with "stuff." And that emptiness could never be filled with “stuff.” That kind of emptiness is something only God can fill. It's only His love and His healing touch that can fill that God shaped hole.

City Lights was an anachronism when it first appeared, a new silent production from Charles Chaplin, one of the masters of silent comedy, at a time when the rest of Hollywood was eagerly embracing the arrival of sound. Released in 1931, when silent film was all but dying out, the film opens by immediately mocking the talking pictures, with a scene where a group of local dignitaries deliver speeches commemorating the unveiling of a statue. As they speak, the synchronized soundtrack (Chaplin's one modest concession to the new technology) features muffled nonsense noises, as though Chaplin is making a point, up front, of how irrelevant and silly so much dialogue is — as Norma Desmond would say in Sunset Blvd., it's all just "talk, talk, talk," and Chaplin for one doesn't need it.

"If I had my priesthood to live over again I would be a gentler with people the next time. I would console more and challenge more carefully. I was one of those people who was taught and who deeply believed that only the full truth can set us free, that we owe it to people to challenge them with the truth, in season and out. I believed that and did it for most of the years of my ministry. And I was a good priest, I lived for others and never once betrayed in any real way my vows and my commitment. But now that I am older, I regret some of what I did. I regret that sometimes I was too hard on people! I meant it well, I was sincere, but I think that sometimes I ended up laying added burdens on people when they were already carrying enough pain. If I were just beginning as a priest, I would be gentler, I would spend my energies more trying to lift pain from people. People are in a lot of pain. They need us, first of all, to help them with that!”"

Shardlake is a fully realised character, a very human mix of good and bad, attractive and unattractive qualities. He is intelligent and humane, a rational thinker, a follower of Erasmus and a keen reformer, believing that religious reform will improve the human condition. Yet he also unquestioningly accepts the class distinctions of his time and defends the resulting injustices, he is quick to take offence at any real or imagined reference to his disability (Shardlake has a hunchback), and it seems his zeal for reforming the monasteries may owe something to unpleasant childhood experiences in a cathedral school as well as to Erasmus’ ideals. Nevertheless, Shardlake is driven mainly by a search for truth and justice, and his disillusion as he is forced to recognise that many ‘reformers’ are more concerned with ego, greed, vanity and abuse of power, is both convincing and poignant. The other characters are clearly portrayed as individuals, though none has the depth of Shardlake. I will be interested to see how (if?) Shardlake and his principles manage to navigate the rest of Henry VIII’s increasingly tyrannical reign as it unfolds.

That NWB is dominated by Toribio hence he favors it over NLU.

My position at the time was, "if you build it, they will come"; new jail construction, Grits argued, would accommodate bad policies while jail crowding forced the system's collective managers to confront them. So I'm particularly encouraged by indications that Harris County judges are now acknowledging their role in the problem and attempting to help resolve it. A defense attorney:

As a result, Christian America welcomed all religions, with Muslims arriving here by 1619, Jews establishing their first synagogue in 1654, and Buddhists, Hindus, and others also being present from the early days. Significantly, only America extended (and continues to extend) a free-market religious tolerance to others while still preserving the core societal values of our Christian heritage. But the culture has begun to shift. The level playing field is being eroded. As in Europe, Christianity is being knocked down and Islam elevated.

Too often records made up of minimal components are misinterpreted as being gloomy, but this is unlikely to be a fate which befalls Kammerspiel, given the sunlit glow which bathes its sounds. Opening song ‘Maschines’ begins with a twinkling melody and builds gently like the breaking of the day, culminating in Kampman softly cooing “You are home”. As the album progresses, you come to see that the template of ‘Maschines’ is in fact the blueprint for much of Conquering Animal Sound’s work. Frequently their songs begin in timorous fashion, gradually layering more and more sounds on top as they build. Let’s be clear though, this isn’t to say that Kammerspiel is in any way guilty of being formulaic, because the band display a boundless creativity with the finer details throughout, a little snippet of tape hiss here, a dissonant hint of cello or a snatch of thickly-distorted vocal sample there, meaning you’re never really fully aware of where they’re taking you at any point.

My second husband was another story. The last six months we were together he was astonished why I would still want to be divorced when things between us were getting so much better. I had just resigned myself to saying yes to anything just to get him to sign the paperwork. I didn’t throw his clothes out on the lawn and kick him out, but as soon as the divorce was final I got rid of most everything he’d left behind.
Moving on, my husband was very upset with me. He woke up and cleaned the house the following morning. We had argued the night before and the following morning. What frustrated me was that I was fuming mad and instead of stopping the fight then and there he fed the fire. Which can be a very dangerous thing. We ended up saying hurtful things towards each other because of stress and anger. A few things he said in our fight BEFORE this one, which was a day or two prior, really hurt me. I had brushed it off my shoulder at the time and even laughed it off. We made up quickly and it wasn't a big deal. Then it really started to eat away at me. Which I think is why I burst into an argument the way I did.

So, that took care of most of the symptoms, but then I was still was getting kidney/bladder infections even after going off the Singulair. Guess what, turns out that another of my fucking prescription meds has been messing with my pancreas, kicking out sugar into my urine and causing those kidney/bladder infections. Again, it was me that figured that one out, without help from the doctors.
People have to be told,
And from San Antonio's George Cochran:
‘The best man wins’ is the dictum and philosophy in truly democratic and civilised countries.
vs 1: Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
It’s noon now, and the radio reports that the highway is closed from Nipigon to Hearst – that’s 5 hours of driving time in normal conditions.
The heat retention of the U3 and U5 products are what set them apart. Obviously with hot blood pumping through its vessels, the human penis is just as warm as the hot cavernous folds of our lady parts, which is the reason I have always soaked my toys in hot water before using them. It’s regardless of that, they lose their heat and feel cold and unnatural inside me.
Luke's hand, fingers and knuckles were covered with open wounds, but none of them were deep. They did have gravel embedded in them, though, as did the huge scrape on his arm. But his chin had a small but deep chunk torn out of it. I had immediate visions of spending the rest of the wedding day sitting in an emergency room, waiting for stitches.
My life is a work in progress. It’s always been that case. Take for example I worked my butt off to get out of my small fishing community and realized at the pivotal age of 12 the only way out was securing a good education, applying for student loans and saving money. I started working at the local drug store at the age of 16, babysat every chance I could and saved every penny for university. Once I got to university I quickly realized those A’s I had received were worth C’s. I gathered my courage and approached every professor and bless those English and History professors at Dalhousie University for taking the time to teach me how to write a proper English paper, how to write up a Bibliography and how to use the library.
A clinical psychologist, Ellen Weber Libby, PhD, has written The Favorite Child ($18.00, Prometheus Books, softcover) based on thirty years of helping successful, often powerful clients in Washington, D.C., where outsized personalities abound. Based on more than 60,000 hours of therapeutic counseling her book looks at the advantages and disadvantages of being the favorite child. Having been brought up to believe they can do anything, being unafraid of challenges, they often suffer an array of personality problems from the pressure to maintain the façade at all costs. Their ability to tell the truth can suffer and their intimate relationships are often elusive. We have seen this over and over again when politicians are brought down by adulterous affairs and other bad behavior. I found this book provided powerful insights and, if you think you were a favorite child or a member of your family was one, you might well want to read this interesting book. From the same publisher there’s God’s Brain by Lionel Tiger and Michael McGuire ($25.00, Prometheus Books) that takes part in the fractious debate about the existence of God and the nature of religion. What makes this book particularly interesting is that the authors approach the topic based on evolutionary biology with a focus on brain science. Tiger is a famed anthropologist and McGuire is a pioneering neuroscientist. The thesis they put forth is that the brain creates religion and its varied concepts of God and then, in turns, feeds on its creation to satisfy innate neurological and associated social needs. Not exactly the story you got from the Old and New Testament or other sacred text, but surely a fascinating exploration of how religion helps “soothe” the mind in a stressful world. One can see this at work when people with strong religious beliefs are able to cope with tragedy in a fashion that reduces the initial shock and guides them to a successful response.
Chris came into the garage at some point during this, and agreed to make my cuts for me with the jig saw. I don't fit behind tools anymore, so I either have to bend over waaaay low to get things below my belly, or just pass the task of to Chris.
This kitchen also has the glass doors on the upper cabinets, cabinets to the ceiling and MARBLE counter tops. Not crazy about the horse above the stove though (who would do that to such a nice kitchen?).
I sketched a simple teapot shape and enlarged it on the computer. I used this as a template to make my card base. Once I had the shape cut out I added the striped sage paper at the top and bottom of the card. I softened the edges with a little pale green blending chalk. I used Creative Inspirations Paint in Winter Frost and added a little detail to the edges with a paint brush. The shimmer really added that little something extra to the card. I gathered a piece of cream lace by hand and glued it to the card, I attached a little garden twine over this to make it a little more secure.
I had high hopes for “Illusion.” Maybe 20 years back, I’d enjoyed “This Present Darkness,” as well as other Peretti books. I think I’ve read that this is his first book in seven years.
OK - things have been rather busy and hectic recently with one thing and another.

Season three opens with a few new characters. After having success with the first two seasons, Sheehan moved on to other projects. If you follow the series closely, you are immediately turned off by the new addition of “Rudy”. Rudy is basically Nathan played by a different actor, but also has taken the raunchy humor even higher than Nathan. After the first two episodes I was going to stop watching the series, but then I realized that the writers overcame the loss of Sheehan. The humor is still hilarious and the characters still maintain some integrity without completely falling apart. I actually enjoyed the character of Rudy, played by actor Joseph Gilgun.

The Christmas edition of The Economist (17 December) carries a fascinating feature, "Portrait of the artist as an entrepreneur", which you can read in full on The Economist website here. This article chronicles the manner in which Albrecht Dürer commercialised his art works and explains the cost-effectiveness of generating printed engravings and woodcuts in preference to painting in oils: the effort was comparable, but the profitability of selling copies made the non-painting options far more attractive and the publicity and exposure helped expand his reputation far more than one-off paintings which were often viewed only by the commissioning party and his immediate associates.
I hadn't heard of Australian blogger Oliver Dupon of Dossier37.tumblr.com, but then he probably hasn't heard of me either. But thankfully he has made it his job to check out over 70 artisans from all over the world and bring them together in one place.

There are many types of bullying, including racial bullying, sexual bullying and cyber bullying. Bullying includes name calling, saying or writing derogatory comments, purposely excluding an individual from activities, spreading lies and rumors, ignoring, threatening, doing anything to make another person feel uncomfortable or scared, stealing or damaging belongings of others, kicking, hitting, slapping, and making someone do things they do not want to do.
As my dear 9 year tells me when I try to explain to her this plan without crying, " Mom, if it is God's will, than no matter what, we will happy."
I got to thinking what it would be like to really wean ourselves off our addiction to money and consumerism and with the #OWS movement now out in full force campaigning for our rights to equality and justice I find myself thinking about it all over again. This process has showed me how much could be changed about our day to day lives if we didn’t use this kind of pervasive and perverse system. I think it can be handy, even just as an intellectual exercise if nothing else, to try to step outside the money way of thinking to allow mental space for the possibility of something new to grow. Just as science fition often becomes science fact, given enough time. I don’t claim to hold all the answers and there is so much out there I do not know enough about, but here is my 2 cents on the subject in the small hope it might help someone out there in a better position than I to do something about it:
DESCRIPTION: Want to boost your metabolism, lose weight and feel better? In this two hour class you'll get a better understanding of what your metabolism is, how you can accelerate it and just what foods will rev it up or put the brakes on it. Find out the biochemical problems with Low Fat Diets and why a breakfast of cereal and skim milk does not “do a body good.” Maria’s recipes and diet secrets have been featured on television programs, radio shows and magazine articles. She has also been interviewed many times on the importance of balancing your brain neurotransmitters and how that equates to weight loss success. The more sugar we eat, the more we crave it. If you start your day off with cereal and skim milk, you aren’t going to be able to walk by the candy jar in your office at 2pm! Check out these to breakfast comparisons:
For those of you still interested enough to hear more of me (!!) there is another interview being broadcast this week on BBC Radio Scotland; it’s part of a series called ‘Pioneers’ and I was really flattered to be asked to contribute, especially as I feel like there is still so much more I would like to achieve. The presenter, Clare English, was a real joy to work with, and to be honest it felt more like a chat with a good friend than an interview!
I just had to promise not to deface...sorry, customise...them before this weekends preview. Speaking of which...

And these beliefs follow us toward adulthood. I, of course, being inquisitive, questioned my geography teacher, who told me it would be New Zealand.
In today’s world, our generation has become increasingly dependent on our smart phones. During every free moment in our hectic lives (such as lunch), we are texting friends, checking emails, playing games, or checking our social networking page. It angers me how people get caught up in their smart phones and not pay attention to the other people around them. I find this to be rather rude and insulting.
"Do you want her to be calm and beautiful?" asks the teacher.
But, today on a longer-than-normal drive back north, I realized something: I'm young. Twenty somethings are supposed to be unsatisfied... and honestly, if I wasn't, I'd be extremely worried about myself.
Superheroes, on the other hand, reveal the best things about our humanity by comparing physical capabilities with mental and/or emotional facilities. The hero isn’t a hero because he has super-strength. The hero was a hero, first; the powers come later. (There’s a reason DC chooses Batman, the only “human” superhero, always to save the day.) Heroes are heroes because they choose to be. They are the best in each of us and to present them any other way is a mistake. Their flaws, the obstacles to their self-awareness, these things make them better heroes. Superheroes give us a template for being better people: working through your weaknesses is what makes you strong.

I’ll admit it, up until two weeks ago I had never tried a brussel sprout and I certainly turned my nose up at them whenever someone suggested that I try them. Why? I have absolutely NO IDEA.
Wanting others to like what you like is perfectly normal. But where many people go wrong is in how they attempt to approach it. With friends, you mostly have to be respectful about it, and introduce things in a "I think this is so cool and thought you might too, want to watch it/read it/try it with me?" But when it comes to children, so often their very thoughts are considered to be under parental control (because really, what is attempting to teach something against someones will if not attempting to control their thoughts?), parents decide what their children should be interested in, and decide to make it happen.
Frugal Dad.com is an extremely useful website. It has a blog style article section that shares many useful information posts, such as 'how to save on the cost of your summer vacation', or information about emergency dentists. The articles are very factual and informative. They can be followed on:
A simple website for college students all over the nation to share what their quirky professors say with millions of their closest friends.
A headline to a Guardian article today giving the findings of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee declares:
The newly constructed Hungarian constitution reflects an awakening of cultural and moral sensibilities, it recognizes the continuum of history above the trashy verbiage of EU treaties and grants citizenship to Hungarians who live in annexed regions. The Constitution expresses Hungarians’ belief in the role of Christianity in preserving nationhood. It declares that marriage is the sacred union of a man and a woman, and it protects human life from the moment of conception. In addition, the government has withdrawn financial support from money-mongering churches.

Tuesday had me boozing it up with Andraste and Fresh Hell (missing her favorite TV show’s premiere), and we had ourselves a time. Old Knudsen and Dive, we so talked about you. We also shared stories of drink, music, baseball, men folk (I know what SPOUSE’s name is!), gabbing and gabbing until we were drowned out by the karaoke performers—and then we laughed.

Offering free instruction on how to do something seems to be the most popular headline out there – online and off. People love to get stuff for free and people who are selling things love it even more. If you, like me, are trying to establish yourself as a fiction writer but also as a content expert, you should make sure to use some of these headlines, sprinkled in with your book sales tweets. I don't yet have my first Romantic Suspense novel done/released, so these tweets dominate my current stream of linky-tweets.
This last paragraph comes the closest to telling me the gist of the story, but it should be expanded to the size of the whole query and should absorb pieces of (but not all) of the paragraphs above it. The skeleton of the story here is that two people need to find the same guy—Grandpa Henry—for different reasons and they come together to make that happen. But we don’t learn this information until the last paragraph and by that point, you seem to be wrapping up.

I'm not sure if I've mentioned before but he is a serious groper. He gets very angry with me if I stop his busy hand from rubbing and running anywhere he can reach. This is a BIG issue for me. I've been working with him on it since he was 7 or 8 months old and am not having much luck. Any time I have worn a nursing necklace, he has beaten me with it, so this hasn't helped. I usually have to wear a tank top under a long sleeved shirt to limit his access. Why the trouble you ask? Because the sensation is SO uncomfortable for me on SO many levels. It gives me MAJOR heebie jeebies and always has. It's just too much touch on sensitive skin all at once for me and I find myself gritting my teeth just to get through it.

One interesting thing about the Bohn signage though is it mostly appears on commercial buildings, obvious rentals and a lot of vacant homes. Obvious that Bohn is supported by the landlord class in this town.

Jerome: Not a change of place, for God, by whom all things are filled, cannot be absent from any place; but He seems to be absent from the vineyard, that He may leave the vine-dressers a freedom of acting.
The stake of this “unusual” festival is as big as it is straightforward: living proof that the spirit of Romania may be included in the circuit of universal values, but maintaining the ineffable component not subject to marketing, by supplying real values that contribute to Romania’s real, clear and soulful image in world .
The elephant in Botswana is a different type than the elephant in Thailand; even more different are the contexts in which these elephants live and the types of responses that the societies and governments take to protect them. The “colonial study abroad student” who lacks curiosity about the context of the host country, and who takes the experience without sharing it, may need to be pushed by the desire to gain university credit. But there may be other ways to raise curiosity in students and wean them from the veranda. We have perhaps left too little unstructured time in the programs: time alone in which boredom can breed curiosity.

Now, you may doubt that Jesus's Mom would appear to people in chocolate drippings, grilled cheese sandwiches, or tortillas, but you have to remember that this is America, and we are big, fat fucks, and the only thing that we will pay attention to is food or TV. The Virgin cannot demean Herself by appearing on "The OC" (like there are any virgins on there, anyway; She would stand out like a sore thumb amongst all those teenage whores), so food it is.

Chill dough 1 hour if it's sticky or difficult to handle.
If this is the way the non-grieving public learns about grief, no wonder so few of us understand what grieving means until we find ourselves immersed in this strange new world. Because of the lack of characters who grieve properly, I’ve been toying with writing a book about a grieving woman, even going so far as to write a few scenes while the emotion is still fresh in my mind (though I can’t imagine ever forgetting what it feels like to grieve for a soul mate — every single day in a thousand ways, I am reminded once again that he is gone).

I kept trying to run while putting the camera back into the pouch of the hand held bottle, got incredibly frustrated and at mile 4 decided to put the camera in the safest place in the world, my jog bra. By mile 5, I felt a BZZZZT in my bra and it really hurt! As I ran over to the side of the course to stop, the BZZZZZT wouldn’t stop- I pulled out the camera, forced it into the water bottle pouch and shook my head… my teeth felt really funny and my jaw was kind of sore. Who completely electrocutes them self during a race?!?!?
There are two sides to a death. The side you see; the tears, the mourning, the hugs, the flowers, family, friends, ceremony and trimmings. Then there is the business side of death the side you don't see until you are the one charged with settling your loved one's last wishes. That side is clinical. There are rules, there are regulations, there are expenses and paperwork that all the kind hearted, compassionate people in the world cannot take that away.

Now that you've arrived the days are flying off the calendar so quickly that I haven't even had a chance to blog but once so far this month and it's already the tenth! For some reason at the beginning of this deployment time just seemed to drag on and on. Maybe because it's a much longer deployment than last time, but for whatever reason it just seemed to take FOREVER!!!!

As for the Pakatan, once the full result of the GE-13 is known, it must swiftly swear-in and take control of the country. Whether it will be blocked by the army and the police on UMNO’s orders is a different issue and needs to be solved separately. But Pakatan must seize the day, it must be tough and clear-minded. If UMNO refuses to cede power, and creates riots, Pakatan should play smart and not fall into UMNO’s trap. The United Nations, of which Malaysia is a member, will surely be watching and they will help to ensure order by putting pressure on UMNO.
When I feel inspired to write a post here I find myself swerving toward the positive. I guess I keep my sad times to myself. They still happen and they usually take the form of NOT writing on the blog. Conspicuous by my absence I guess.

That’s a very appealing notion for many people in America these days, and it’s worth glancing at the reasons why that should be so. To begin with, of course, a great many people in America do sit on their backsides and get rich. Most of them sit in the corner offices of large corporations, where they spend their time making decisions that, to judge by the results, would be better off made with one of those Magic 8-Balls: “reply hazy, ask again later.” John Kenneth Galbraith pointed out with a commendable lack of restraint in his book The Culture of Contentment that in America, as a rule, the more money you make, the less work you have to do—and, one might add, the less value you have to produce. Consider the upper reaches of the American banking industry, with their multimillion-dollar annual bonuses: what, other than misery for millions of ordinary people, do they actually produce?

Typing out the quote above, I wondered if I'd discovered the secret to Chris Christie's rhetoric. It's a rule of 3. Say something once. Then restate it with the same key words, but in a somewhat different order. Then say it a third time, carrying over some key words — e.g., "America" and "next 5 weeks" — and add on one new thought. (Let me know if you see other examples of what I'll call The Christie Rule of 3.)
Just when I thought (hoped) I was done writing (downloading) about DNA and I stare at my computer screen waiting for the information to flow all I can see are these spirally things sticking out of a body.

even today i can see your neat and tidy apartment in my mind. it was STUNNING in it's cleanliness. there was never a plate in the sink, and all your copper-bottomed revereware was shined to a mirror finish and hung, in order of size, on the wall. your bed was made so tightly you could have bounced a quarter off of it. all this order wasn't a detriment to your entertaining though.......i loved coming over! we had the best time.........you'd cook me a dinner of mac and cheese, a hamburger patty and peas, and then we'd watch t.v. afterwards (a favorite was 'chico and the man'). we'd go to bed and hold hands talking until we fell asleep. you would always rub my head and my back.

He stood motionlessly, cup in hand, staring out across his yard. If someone had have been traveling down Foxtrot Road at that moment—perhaps on their way into town, headed for work—and looked into Richard Dansky’s front yard, they would have seen the distinct outline of a tall man. Even in the darkest hours of morning, a passerby would have noticed Richard’s rigid and expectant posture. Perhaps they would have noticed the way his chin was raised at an angle, as if he were deep in thought. They would probably assume that Richard was waiting with an almost inspirational gait for the southern Virginia sunrise as he thought about some unnamed task the day would bring.
In the summertime, my mom, the older bro's (brother #3 wasn't born yet), and me would ride our bikes up to the library and spend a couple hours there. Mom would enjoy quiet time around one of her favorite things in the world: the written word. She has quite the library herself at home, too. This library had a decent children's section, but the coolest thing about it was the claw-foot tub. Yes. The library had a claw-foot tub in the children's section to sit in while reading. Since most kids were at summer camps or daycare whenever we went, it was up to my brother's and I to take turns reading in the tub. It's still weird for me to walk into other libraries and see that they don't have a tub. As long as we were good, didn't fight over the tub, and didn't bother mom, we would be able to pick out one piece of candy from an old-school pharmacy store as a treat on the way home. I always picked Necco wafers since there was "so much more candy" than a single candy bar and would last longer. I still smile whenever I see them in a store. Thanks for humoring me with a trip down memory lane.
I was chatting to the horribly young Valerio after he had delivered our wood for the winter when he happened to point out that he and his brother were responsible for clearing the snow from our roads (see above, that is him last winter). "Lordy" I said, "what a wonderful job, all that power and effect, master of all that you see, clearing a path for us humble peasants" in effect the usual nonsense.
"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith (not religion or good works), we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.

Jamie should have known something was off about the church of the Right and the Real from the start, especially when the Teacher claimed he wasn’t just an ordinary spiritual leader, but Jesus Christ, himself. But she was too taken by Josh, the eldest son of one of the church’s disciples, and his all-American good looks. Josh is the most popular boy at school too, and the first boy outside the drama geeks to give Jamie a second look. But getting her Dad involved in a cult was not part of the plan when she started dating Josh. Neither was her dad’s marriage to the fanatic Mira, or getting kicked out, or seeing Josh in secret because the church has deemed her persona non grata.

One of my favorite blogs was the one titled Game of Thrones and the Seduction of Nerdism, in which I discussed the way in which I overcame my hesitancy and became a huge fan of the series. My goal with this piece was to display my own misgivings which others may relate to and then show how wrong I was. Because Game of Thrones is so visually appealing, it was not difficult to find images which help to prove my points. The introduction is long, but none of my other blogs contain as much voice as I felt this one did, which is why when I discovered that my first attempt to post it (on this horrible computer) had failed, I found the word document in which it was originally written and reposted it. Upon receiving comments about the blog, I changed the organization of the introduction to, hopefully, make it more engaging to someone who is unfamiliar with the series, without delving into the complex aspects of the plot. Discovery was the theme of this post, and I hoped it would inspire others to discover those complex narratives for themselves.
Little did she know, I thought connivingly, that me and Bogdan, when we’d no fanny to hand, would take turns on each other in what he liked to call the ‘Daisy Chain’, whereby I would anal him (or vice versa) while giving him a reach-reach around wank, while he would be reaching behind (a reach behind, I suppose) wanking me off, while I, with my one free hand would be rimming myself and trying to reach my male g-spot, while he, with his one free hand, would be left to tickle his own balls. It was an invention we both conceived of one night we were doing coke and had the horn a weaker.

Recorded brain waves are from zero to 24 cycles per second. The brain waves of a person in a meditative state are in alpha state, and the frequency ranges from 9 to 14 cycles per second. During theta state, the brain waves’ frequency goes even slower, from 5 to 8 cycles per second. Physicist Bob Beck discovered that during mystical work, the brain waves of clairvoyants and psychics were at 7.8 cycles per second, the same rate as that of the resonance of the earth.
"Friends" are telling me not to be "hard" on myself. People are telling me who to date, what to think, where to go. Telling me what I "should" do, how I should do it, and at what speed I should proceed. I am not asking for advice. This is all unsolicited. What is it about a single woman that invites every Tom, Dick, Harry, Joe, Pete, Steve, Mike, Jeff and Marshall to think they need to give me direction? And yes the only people telling me what to do ARE MEN.

It’s 825am this morning and I’m staring at a blank page. The dog is lick-licking herself behind me. It is the background music to the click-clicking of my laptop keys. I don’t know what the hell to write, but I will say as I read the news this morning – I felt like things were all about me. I often read the NY Times and the Huffington Post, pretty much everyday. I read them at the end of the day when I know what I’m going to write first thing in the morning. When I don’t, I read them first – the stalling and the reading often helps to churn up new ideas.
Lately a picture has been passed around on Facebook, and probably also other places. It is depicting an Israeli soldier, standing with one food on a Palestinian girl, pointing his weapon at her, while the girl’s sister is sitting crying next to them. This is passed in order to show the cruelty of the Israelis, or at least the soldiers (but since the general notion is that all Israelis are going to be soldiers, all Israelis are cruel anyway).

As for writing, I have much the same problem. When I write I imagine a scene and through that imagination I watch my characters act and react, hear what they say, see what they do and write it down. When I try to do the same for first person, I find it difficult not to think of myself when writing 'I'. So I can't see the character. Does that make sense to anyone other than me?

While the story is based on an imaginary scientific scenario, the book is not a debate on the medical ethics of cloning. The events that take place which ultimately lead to their determined end explore, ironically, what it means to be human. Using the intricate relationships of the threesome, Ishiguro goes deep into issues of love and loss, dreams and reality, wrongs and their amends, and the ultimate search for the source of being, the very purpose of existence.

The mayo clinic states that the percentage of females who are unable to lift over ten pounds between the ages of 55-64 is forty percent of the population and for those in the 63-74 age bracket these numbers rise only slightly to forty five percent. However, it gets much worse for the 75-84 year olds, where a full sixty five percent of them were unable to lift ten pounds.

The word went around. “If you’re hungry and broke, you can get something to eat at The Salvation Army.”
When a baby is reaching a developmental milestone, they often struggle sleeping and get a little fussy or moody. Yeah, my daughter takes that to a whole new level.

The Pomegranates are ripe and ready for eating here and as they are a great source of vitamin C, B5, potassium and supposed antioxidants that is what I am doing. The easiest way to remove the seeds from the white pulp membranes is to soak them in cold water or alternatively the whole fruit can be frozen, in which case the seeds also separate easily. I prefer to leave them on the trees until the last moment when the pods have split naturally and the seeds are most ripe.

If I rewind to two weeks ago, I sat at this very computer writing about my lack of inspiration and how I was spending much of my time dreading the future, rather than looking forward to it. That post and reflection opened my eyes to a state of mind that I was slowly adapting and accepting … one that commonly makes an appearance when I am faced with impending changes.
In short, he was saying that my life goal must not have wiggle room. I must decide–and decide quickly–what my first priority will be and stick with it. If God has called me to ministry to people with special needs, then I must continue on the path that leads me to that goal. There are so many scriptures that teach this principle that my mind was immediately filled with pictures of men going to battle with an adequate army.

Got me thinking though, that maybe, babies who were born spontaneously from vaginas and breastfed probably have an advantage over those who were not. I mean, my granddad was your regular tough man from the block in his heyday with all the vices the world could provide at his hands. He used to smoke like a chimney and could finish two cases of beer in one sitting. He was born to a poor family of eight kids in the 1920’s, delivered vaginally with no complications and breastfed because there was no money for formula milk. He’s now 89 years old and, ignore the catheter dangling from his leg, he’s still spry. He has the most unbelievable immune system… although I’m not saying you should leave your kid/s with their vices, gosh no. Your brand of parenthood is uniquely your own.

I get why Doomsday Preppers is on the air and I don’t knock Nat Geo for capitalizing on the increased interest in prepping brought about by economic turmoil, the solar maximum, and the arrival of 2012. In fact, even though I generally find myself scoffing at the television while watching the show, I think that we, as preppers, should be thankful that they are shining a light on the preparedness movement – even if that light isn’t as favorable as we might like. If the show plays up some of the worse prepper stereotypes in order to drum up an audience and leverages the idea that “all preppers are a little nuts” to get people to tune in, who cares as long at it inspires some people to think about being more prepared.
I bought him a special Kong collar™ today at Pet Supermarket. It's an inflatable "c" shaped collar that closes with velcro. It works like a cone, but doesn't protrude so that he runs into things or can't get a drink of water while wearing it.

For some reason, almost all the Illamasqua blushes are matte. I think the formulation of this is deliberate - the theory is probably that if you want to add shimmer to them, you will layer on a separate shimmer product to customize the level, size, and type of shimmer/glitter you want - just like the pros. These are all work-appropriate since they are matte, and come in wearable colours. Despite the brand's outrageous image, today's swatches are all colours you can wear to the strictest office.

It is not always easy to prevent RSI that is caused from working in an office. Many factors can stop you from taking preventative measures. Your boss may have a large document to compile; you may be short staffed at work and having to cover for several colleagues over the holiday period or due to sickness; your company doesn’t have the money to provide a good desk set up for you despite your many requests; and the list goes on. However, there are measures you can take despite these types of obstacles:
Plus there’s nothing new I could add to by creating another male protagonist. There’s a lack of true reflection on the nature of what they do since it’s ‘expected’ of boys to be warriors, at least in literature. By having a female warrior it gave me the opportunity to question this, since Billi doesn’t have the same expectations of ‘what she should be’.

In summary, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and message forums were one of the early modes of online communications with anonymous users. There was no expectation that the users would ever meet in person. Later, some groups and organizations used the Internet as their primary mode of communication, and meeting users in person was a by-product of attending club events. Nowadays, the norm of modern social media tools and websites is that profiles disclose a person's true identity, and meeting up with other users in person is no longer considered taboo or "weird". Websites like Meetup.com or Twtvite.com are examples of websites created to facilitate offline meetings of online communities.

Knowing that the Manhattan-bound lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge were scheduled to close for emergency pothole repairs at midnight, savvy drivers headed out of Brooklyn around 11 p.m. Thursday night -- only to get stuck in a massive traffic jam as workers shut down the bridge an hour before it was supposed to close.
Well, it happened. The thing that I've been dreading for almost four years happened yesterday on a lovely, end of the summer evening with friends. We had been invited to a barbeque at a nearby neighborhood swim club that our friends belong to. It was Friday of Labor day weekend. Did we want to bring the kids over for a swim and a potluck dinner? Actually, yes! It is difficult for our family to socialize together with other families because of the Joshua factor. Barbequing at a pool is a perfect setting to give it a try. Swimming is one of the things that all of our kids, including Josh, love to do. The adults might even get some conversation in over a glass of wine while grilling some bacon wrapped pork chops.

What it's about (or at least how it seemed to me): Narrator Dom Ullis is a young, educated world traveller who occasionally frequents an opium den in a rather seedy quarter of Bombay in the '70's.

She becomes the moral and emotional center of the story, a seeker who loves to read and who continually reaches toward spiritual and philosophical clarity.

‘Needle Stuck on Lebanon’ sounded particularly resonantly. The broken record metaphor is galvinised to represent the ongoing attacks of Israel on Lebanon in 2006. The track opens with a siren, the crackles of a record player and recordings of radio, tv and internet news broadcasts covering the Israeli bombings – “the Israeli bombardment of southern Beirut has begun again, and again, and again,” one broadcaster is puppeteered by SC MoCha to stutter. The track’s high woeful melody meanders along before quickening to the sound of a crunching beat, like rubble underfoot, and missiles hissing.

I have to laugh now (although I wasn't finding it overly amusing the night I made it), but looking back at Krista's post regarding the meal, she mentioned that her kids were not big fans of the "gravy". Ironically, my kids and I all really enjoyed the chicken, "gravy" and all (although I did put it sparingly on my kids' chicken)--it was my husband who didn't seem to care for it. (Not overly surprising--he's the pickiest eater in our home!) He thought the onion flavor was "too overpowering". Here's the thing...I fully admit that I've had onions that were VERY strong and while I happen to enjoy the flavor of onion, there have been times in which I've scraped off some excess, because it was in fact "too overpowering". By no means did I think the onion flavor was too much--it was actually a very mild onion. He kills me, too, because he asked me "are the onions cooked?". Ummmm...yeah...by TWO different methods! Not only did I saute them, but they were then baked within the sauce for about 25 minutes while my chicken was in the oven. (He even watched me take the chicken out, with the sauce covering it!) I love him dearly, but he drives me crazy sometimes!!! I've mentioned this in prior posts, but before we started dating (about 10 years ago), he literally ate the same 3-4 meal rotation. He NEVER would have considered eating onions before I started cooking for him, but he will eat them in certain dishes now. As far as this dish is concerned, I'm honestly not sure if it was more in his head, just because he previously had himself convinced that he didn't like onions and this chicken was obviously smothered in them. If he'd be willing to try it again, perhaps I'll try a Vidalia onion...doesn't get much more mild than that! In the meantime, I'm going to enjoy devouring the leftovers, all by myself :)

If we were permitted to make choices we might begin to think. And then we might believe, for a second, that we are human.”

Why spend so much time on this comparison between the Watergate scandal and Operation Fast and Furious? Because it is the Rosetta stone for understanding how Obama's Gangster Government came creeping in, bent on turning the United States into a total control grid, where vestigial scraps of freedom will be doled out by the State to obedient subjects. When a Gangster Government is not opposed by an honest media or the threat of meaningful congressional hearings, it is emboldened and it advances. This is the outcome of President Obama's new policy of ruling by executive decree, and his repeatedly stating that, "If the congress won't act, I will."

Lemme unwrap that a little. I'm not saying that I could, say, eat 3000 calories of healthy food in a day and lose weight. I couldn't. What I'm saying is: if I eat mostly healthy, mostly unprocessed foods, I can cram a lot more food in for the same amount of calories. OH MAN.

Further, Hale also has trouble with grammatical categories that Pullum does not take her down for. She uses the opening of a short story by Jo Ann Beard to talk about "static verbs": "Here is a scene. Two sisters are fishing together in a flat-bottomed boat on an olive green lake ..." Apparently, Hale sees "is" in the first sentence and "are" in the second as "static" verbs that should be used carefully so as not to make one's writing too static. But the "are" in the second sentence is part of the phrase "are fishing", and "to fish" is surely not one of her "static" verbs.

Ruvo’s obsession with funding neuroscience research was born from personal tragedy. In 1992, his father, Lou Ruvo, who owned a local Italian restaurant, started showing the early signs of Alzheimer’s, but after taking him to various physicians in Nevada, no one could seem to properly diagnose him. A physician friend recommended Lou see an Alzheimer’s specialist in California. “That started the journey,” says Larry Ruvo. “In the waiting room there were three patients: one in diapers, one in a wheelchair and another with his head bent over, out of it. My dad was still cognizant and he said, ‘This is what’s happening to me?’ I told myself if I could do anything to help, it would be to never allow people to lose their dignity.”

My godson spent the weekend with us because my friend was out of town until Sunday morning, so my morning started with a 30-minute drive to get him to his soccer game by 10. I stayed for the game because otherwise no one would be there to cheer for him. I didn’t mind doing this because my friend is a single mom in need of a break. I made my youngest go with me because both my son and my husband were sick (and we do call her Trouble).
What the idiots haven’t figured out yet is what they are going to do when all the whites have been slaughtered or driven out of South Africa and every last possession of white people has been plundered and destroyed. The answer is equally as clear – they turn on themselves and before long the beautiful country that whites built is reduced to rubble and is just another African civil war zone – until the neo-colonizers move in.

Conservatives were much more likely than liberals to believe in life after death, with approximately 80% of conservatives/extreme conservatives reporting that they believe in life after death and only 66% of liberals/extremely liberals reporting the same. (All percentages are rounded upwards.) While a person's belief in life after death is not necessarily predictive of whether he fears death, the results are suggestive and weaken Pyszczynski's paradigm. The Pyszczynski et al theories would seem to imply that belief in life after death is a cognitive defensive mechanism but a sizable proportion of individuals with liberal orientations clearly exhibit the same phenomenon, so it is as least not a peculiarly conservative defence mechanism. And in any event, the number of people who absolutely reject the possibility of an afterlife is very small, only about 9% in this database.

You've punctuated this first sentence oddly. If you take out the phrase between the dashes the sentence doesn't make sense: "drunks and late night security guards free tickets or a few hundred bucks." A dash is like a parenthetical statement.

While this achievement in creating a new FDC is commendable, it is certainly not the first time that an Indian company has developed a FDC, as is being projected in some of the news reports. Cipla and Ranbaxy and in fact most of the Indian drug industry has been extremely adept at developing FDCs. In fact Cipla is credited with pioneering FDCs in the battle against AIDs/HIV. One of its first such FDCs was Triomune, a FDC of three anti-retroviral (ARVs): Lamivudine, stavudine and Nevirapine. The FDC was credited with greatly increasing compliance amongst the HIV patient community since it did away with the need to take the three drugs independently.

If there were two believers recently married, what should they do about sexual intercourse and children that might come forth?

I understood where these moms were coming from since I had heard several of the girls were crushing on various boys in the grade and had orchestrated a number of lunches and movie nights so they could double date. Some of the girls have some serious interest in boys these days. I also knew from the grapevine several kids in the grade have started "dating" and making out. Further, the text under the photo suggested the boy in the pic would not be happy it was posted; in fact, someone remarked "M..is going to be pissed at you for posting that." That's what made me decide to make the phone call. It seemed he might not even know about the photo.
For years medical doctors prescribed antibiotics anytime a child had an ear infection. Overuse of these antibiotics has resulted in “super bugs” – bacteria that is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Serious consequences can result from this resistance; stronger antibiotics are being discovered but eventually bacteria will become resistant to those as well.

We got to the restaurant, ordered dinner and chatted. The usual vital stats were exchanged, talk of our respective jobs. No matter how hard I tried, my eyes were constantly drawn to his mouth; I desperately hoped he didn’t notice. After dinner, where I, like the idiot that I am, ordered the hottest dish on the menu and then carried on as though my mouth wasn’t burning like the deepest bowels of hell, we walked up to the coffee shop and went for a walk around town. We talked about his son, childhood memories, blah blah blah. Short term memory, I don’t remember everything we talked about – he would. I do remember him telling me he was going on the road for 2 weeks the following morning. My immediate thought, “I can’t let him go before I know more” so I suggested a drive and he quickly agreed. I’d love to know what he was thinking at this time, perhaps I’ll ask him.

In my years of work, I've spent many a long hour standing at a flag post directing traffic. It's a long hard day of standing, hoping you don't get hit by a distracted drive, jumping to keep from being hit by a distracted driver, wondering when you'll get a break to go pee, wondering if you'll have time to sit in the shade and eat lunch and the hope it doesn't start raining. Slick highways, and poor visibility, raises the whole danger thing a notch.

Men keep their issues to themselves. Love is like a religion to them especially when they are blinded by it. Men might take time to fall nose deep in love but when they do, they treat it like its divine. If a guy truly loves a woman, he never discusses the intricacies of the relationship with another soul. During a hard time, he controls his boiling rage by drinking it down instead of running around sharing his stories. He slowly finds the solution to patch up things while his woman with her designed plans and strategies, kills his love slowly but steadily. If a man actually wants to tell his close friends that his heart is broken, he simply approaches his gang and says ‘I am broken’. The next thing he knows is his friends dragging him to a bar and together getting sloshed. Now even if he actually shared the problem during his drunken yapping, none of his friends will remember it the next day anyway.
For example, while following a lead about a couple Tennessee men who were taken to an Alabama prison during the time of the Civil War, I discovered Cahaba Prison. Cahaba Prison, also known as Castle Morgan, is located in Old Cahawba, Alabama (I'm not sure why there is a spelling difference). It had been an unfinished cotton warehouse that the Confederate government turned into a prison. Although there were only 432 bunks, it would eventually house more than 3,000 men by 1865. A staggering number crammed into a small space. You can imagine that the living and hygiene conditions were horrendous. Surprisingly the death rate was only 2%, which compared to other prisons this was very low.

Labour is in the process of reviewing its policies and internal Labour polling is showing that the public want a tough responsibilities agenda, similar to that of New Labour but, something closer to Maurice Glasman’s Blue Labour vision. Labour now see ‘New Labour’ as a deeply unhelpful political label (see here) but its essence was modernity, progress, globalisation, mobility, flexibility, individual rights and universal values. Its orientation was for Labour to modernise Britain through an accommodation with capitalism and the pursuit of social justice via the state. This strongly chimed with the Lib Dem position to the point where there were talks of formal coalitions based on shared values and beliefs.

He doesn't promise that everything in your life will magically be better when you become a Christian, but he does promise to be with us through all things and the assurance of Heaven is also a pretty awesome thing.
The extreme ease of becoming rich also comes to the aid of upholding morality; money is never an essential consideration in marriages; commerce, industry, the practice of a profession, assure young people of a living and a future. They marry the first woman they fall in love with; and nothing is rarer in the United States than a bachelor of twenty-five. Society thereby gains more married men in place of licentious bachelors. Finally , the condition of equality protects marriages, while difference in rank obstructs them in our country. In the United States there is only one class; no barrier of social distinction separates the young man and young girl who agree to become united. This equality, propitious to legitimate unions, is highly embarrassing to those which are not. The seducer of a young girl necessarily becomes her husband, whatever the difference in their economic position, because while superiority of fortune exists, there is no difference at all in rank. The rectitude of tradition, which applies less to individuals than to society as a whole, gives a serious cast to all American society.

If you paid me £210,000 a year as opposed to what I get now then some of that money would trickle down and out into the general economy.

So how was the food? Zizou’s pork chop was overcooked but still strong in flavor. But I was really scared when my Vienna sausage and ensalada rusa came out. I knew that my ensalada rusa, a classic Spanish tapa, would be full of mayonnaise and not in a good way, but I felt this perverse desire to order it. The sausage looked like my worst nightmares, so pink and clean and consistent. But it was delicious. The smoothness of its texture didn’t mean that it was lacking in character. And even the ensalada rusa was comforting and satisfying, because it was exactly as I had expected it to be.

Returning the serve, is it excellence? Maybe it’s the two sides to the coin, or it’s the snake eating itself, the perpetual motion and return, the breathing. If those in charge just let those players who can handle the moment and control it and actually become better whilst within that sphere play, just flat-out play, flat-out play they will.

The weeks generally been taken up with my normal wombling and also a fair bit of gardening - having given this up at home - I'm tending to rampage around other people gardens. Don't worry I'm not guerrila gardening on the quiet - I'm not that keen - however I'm often caught rampaging around other folks gardens (lets call them clients, it sounds better than being a garden stalker). I only tend to play, or interfere in, sorry I mean work in, with a few folks gardens, and this week - play was stopped by snow. SNOW! I gave up weeding the rockery I was rampaging around after I couldn't see the weeds for the white stuff.
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) – Afghanistan would support Pakistan in case of military conflict between Pakistan and the United States, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in an interview to a private Pakistani TV channel broadcast on Saturday.
I and I know many other parents and members of our community expect a full and open investigation by school administrators and law enforcement into this issue and to hold accountable any and all those who had a hand in this despicable act.
Jeff and I talked about our fears- that when she is a teen, she will be one of those uber-popular mean girls and will be heading up the Burn Book and tagging other kids to get picked on and directing her minions to do her bullying for her. And that's why we address it every time it comes up. We could have just laughed off that card. We could have joked about it. We could have made light of it. We could have ignored it and just thrown it away.

In a very real way to be human is to love other species and so long as that remains rational and not carried to extremes that is a very good thing.
I also love GPB because it supports the NPR stations which seamlessly cover the air waves from Atlanta to Savannah– and thus provide the only entertainment available on the excruciatingly boring 4-hour drive from Atlanta to Savannah, where we have a little cottage that we rarely visit because of the aforementioned drive.
Here we have a little town consisting of the simplest and plainest buildings in the main, and yet, owing to the splendid placing of its two public buildings and to the arrangement of its streets and places, the whole presents a degree of beauty and impressiveness quite astonishing

Before his final release in 2000, prison officials referred him for evaluation as a sexually violent predator. In 2010, a state psychologist concluded he could be safely released under supervision because of his age and Landau petitioned for his release, but the director of the Coalinga State Hospital disagreed with the doctor’s assessment.

“Part of him was like, ‘How could I just stand by and watch that happen?’ It was a really horrible, stark moral choice that he faced and he still wrestles with that,’’ Martinkus said.

Now that I’m back in Valparaíso, routine feels more comforting and less confining. Returning to a real bed was, as always, a wonderful feeling, and I can’t believe I’ve just past the two month mark here. Tomorrow I’ll be headed to Buenos Aires for another week of adventure, which I assume will be the topic of my next post.
It wasn't one of the most momentous events of our lives?

Rowan went to meet Santa for the second time this year. You can see the first picture below under “Thanksgiving Celebrations”. This second time was less rushed and he really liked Santa! It was funny because his friend Sam who was with us was excited about Santa while we were in line but terrified when he met him, Rowan was the exact opposite! Silly boys.
Such people can be pushed by circumstances to take desperate measures and this sad case should heighten calls for more support and better protection for people living on the edge.

This movie definitely doesn’t present a “plan of salvation”, and it does not march a bunch of foot soldiers (wearing the armor of God) to the cadence of specific doctrine. Instead what I took away from it was that it let people see the little streaks of light (Christ) poking through the misdirection of a college student that was trying so hard to get as far away from God as possible. God never leaves, and you cannot escape Him.. he is everywhere. He is even at the so-called “God-less” liberal arts colleges.
Better brush up on your Greek alphabet, no? Just to point out a few of the harder ones: Omicron means "little O" in contrast to Omega "big O", Theta stood for death in biblical times (with Tau in opposition as a symbol for life), and Phi stands for the golden ratio (i.e. the golden rectangle). A large deal of the sonnet doesn't hold great meaning as single lines, but as a whole paints a general attitude towards Omega. Plus, it's fun. There are a couple possible clichés in the first couple lines, such as "grand and glorious" and "end of ends" (which I would argue is inverted by the subject matter), but I don't think it's that bad (and the rest of the poem is utterly clean).
P.S. I listened to my professors lecture on my recorder hooked up the stereo in the car all the way to the movie theater to make up for the time spent watching the movie. My daughter and her boyfriend got to learn about asthma medications. LOL.

I'm not sure what I'll do tomorrow. I was thinking about watching C but since my headset is broken that would be a hard thing to do so maybe I'll do nothing instead. I'm indecisive but since I've heard better things about the latter pair I'll probably get those. I'm impatient though so waiting for them to ship is going to be unbearable.

Some of these changes will grow in the book publishing industry, but for any new model to succeed, we must take back some of the control given away. Writers must accept that the days of advances from publishers are numbered and that the real ‘work’ of a book is only born when it is printed and they cannot run and hide to pen their next magnum opus in the shed at the end of the garden. This is not too big a price to pay. The reality is that less than 90% of authors receive an advance of $10,000 or less.
But, more basically and importantly, because it is by means of national elections that the government, the regime it heads and the entire political order at whose apex the government stands are morally empowered, “made legitimate”.

I wish I knew the classy way to tell you to get the hell out of my way with your monstrosity of a car, but the New Orleans in me only makes me want to jump out of my car and beat on your window or lean on the horn—either way, not a good look. So, I beseech all of you no-ATM-etiquette donkeys to actually practice having some manners or go inside of the bank. I’m sure there’s someone in there that can appreciate your lackadaisical demeanor –a live teller.
She’s upset that he knew about it and didn’t say anything and I’m thinking that if she feels like that after only a few hours, how should poor Rick Castle feel? Anyway, after confirming that she likes him, he makes her look at him and says the words everyone expected him to say: Don’t like me.
The character of the professor, of course, allows Taylor to explore the serious side of his subject, which brings us back to our introductory axiom: you are what you eat. Taylor interprets this quite literally, arguing that, in times past, the people of any particular region ate the food that the soil and rivers of that region could produce. The building blocks for their bodies came from that location and were demonstrably different from those produced in another region. Thus food is part of what connects us to our land, gives us our unique identity, is, in fact, an essential ingredient in the alchemy of place. The professor begins to divine this truth while studying the homeless in Stanley Park, coming to believe that the tendency of these people, who have lost nearly every human connection, to enact an urge to return to wild land, gives evidence of an innate human need to connect to place, in some ways comparable to the DNA-encoded imperative which brings salmon back to their spawning grounds. It is evidence, as he says, “of the deepest roots of all.”

But the reality is that without a solid economic base, it is impossible to build an effective foreign policy. And under President Obama- inaugurated in January of 2009 and still in office- the number of people who have been unable to find jobs or who are underemployed has gone up and stayed up. The unemployment rate is not 8%, or whatever the bureaucrats quote it as- the unemployment rate is much higher than that. The number of people underemployed or without a job is 20%- 1 in 5 people- and has been such now for almost 4 years and likely will continue to be such if Obama gets reelected.

The famous geometry lesson from The Teaching Gap. I always feel bad showing it, because it is awful, but the teacher seems like a nice fellow that I would like, and very well intentioned. The first five minutes is plenty, although there is a spectacular bit in minutes 37 and 38 where he tries to give a hint.

They quickly reverse and return to where they came from. Rather hilariously one extra playing a Roman is so shocked by the disappearance of the Ambulance that he seems to forget to close his mouth for quite some time. The Doctor deduces that they have driven through a barrier to another time zone. He uses a grenade to blow open a safe in Smythe's office and inside they find a map of the different time zones which appear to include: Roman, Greek, Crimean War, First World War, Peninsular War, American Civil War, Mexican Civil War, English Civil War, Thirty-Years War, Boer War, and Russo-Japanese War.

It is no surprise that the company chose Switzerland to launch this idea. Not only are the Swiss considerable high in purchase power parity, and can therefore afford the pricy Starbucks coffee, they are accustomed to high quality coffee from its neighbor Italy and they are willing to pay for it.
I would dearly love to write full time but I’m under no illusions about how hard this is to achieve. You have to sell a lot of books on a regular basis to do this and I have one title out. I do enjoy my day job too so I’m grateful for that but maybe one day…

The first book – what a disaster! I was so eager to get the book out that I designed the cover myself – in word, enough said! I was rescued by my daughter’s friend at university who was an art graduate. She redesigned the first cover and went on to design the second and third book covers too. Lesson learnt; yes, you DO judge a book by its cover. When I give book talks in schools I always hold up both book covers. The response is overwhelmingly for the redesigned cover – always!

Now the government is trying to force the pace. On April 18th the Central Bank made its sixth consecutive cut to its policy rate, bringing it to 9%, an all-time low in real terms. Its policymakers see subdued global demand as an opportunity to reset rates at a lower level, without risking a return to higher inflation.

Ok, we can’t know what they were texting about. Could have been totally innocent on both their parts. As with any situation when you’re looking for clarity you have to not look to the words; spoken or texted, but look more to the behavior or what it is people do. About 75% of our communication is through body language. It’s through our body language that the story is told and the truth usually comes out.

Now I am going to be honest here, I do not like John Cena. I haven’t always felt this way but after well over 5 years of seeing him win and win and win, never sell an injury and smile like a doofus I have had enough of his act. The people in the crowd who chant “CENA SUCKS!” to combat the high-pitched shrill of “LET’S GO CENA” feel the same way. It’s not that Cena is a bad guy, it’s that we’re sick of his act. You can only watch the same story play out so often before you grow sick of it. With Cena, I am sick of it.

Something else to consider, when my client has a large scale project that is overwhelming the best tip I can give is to break the project down into manageable parts. Look at the pieces of the project separately and decide when to start. Assign a little time each day until that portion of the project is finished. Set a timer for 20 minutes when the timer rings come to a logical stopping point and walk away from the project. Maybe take care of one or two small tasks. Then begin the next part of the project. Do this until the entire project is finished. Believe me, you’ll be finished before you know it because it’s not overwhelming when broken apart into manageable pieces.

The orgasm was now clearly in control and I was along for the ride. I groaned and mumbled and tensed in her lap and gave her quite the show. The waves kept coming and coming one blended into the next with dozens and dozens of orgasms cascading one into the next. I was afloat in orgasmic anguish in a pool of sexual rapture and pleasure was agonizingly intense. The waves of orgasms stretched out longer and longer with shorter and shorter respite between them. After 45 minutes there was no respite between them at all and they were getting extremely hard. They were now were back to back and very powerful. My experience has been that the longer the session goes on the more intense each subsequent set of orgasmic waves becomes.

I'm not Catholic, but from what I understand, Mardi Gras is an opportunity for Catholics to eat all the fattening foods they can before the beginning of Lent (which starts tomorrow, Ash Wednesday). But for midwesterners we also think of Fat Tuesday as Paczki Day! Growing up, I thought eating paczkis was the way everyone acknowledged Fat Tuesday, but it turns out it's a bit more of a midwestern thing, due to the large Polish communities in the midwest. So in case you've never heard of them before, paczkis are a polish donut and just thinking about them makes your butt grow two sizes.

Favorite Ethnic Cookbook: Both encyclopedia and cookbook, Flavors of Malaysia by Chef Susheela Raghavan is a comprehensive and intriguing look at Malaysian cuisine. Besides all of the recipes, there is a lengthy history and reference section. There is even a section on how to give a Malaysian flair to other recipes. It is well written, interesting and very informative, one of the best ethnic cookbooks I have seen in a long time and I highly recommend it.

That counts. Right?)
A glimpse of what all this has cost the U.S. economy can be seen by looking north to Canada, where animal spirits have been unleashed in the energy sector. Canada’s close economic ties to the U.S. have traditionally meant that when the U.S. gets the sniffles, Canada gets swine flu. This time it’s been different. Part of the reason is that Canada’s housing market was not poisoned by a federal government push to put unqualified borrowers into homes they could not afford. After the 2008 collapse of the housing bubble in the U.S., the Canadian financial sector remained strong.

Now I had never heard of Alex before, and I’m still not sure exactly what he does, but fair play to the lad. At only 23, he’s enjoying a cushy number in the bullshit capital of the world-the City of London-and getting paid a shedload for it. And he’s not afraid to spend it. Hence his big night out at the Playboy Club in Liverpool.
With that insight, let me ask a few questions… “What are you currently doing in your life that you know you can’t afford to do…and haven’t had the strength to change? What are you spending money on that you know you don’t need and can’t afford but you just aren’t strong enough to let go of?

Freefall is a mixture of romance, drama and coming of age. There are several intense scenes filled with unadulterated emotion but the underlying messages run deep and strike the reader quickly and strongly. Despite these scenes, the majority of the book really is humorous. Much of this comes from Seth. Scott has nailed the male narrative, bringing Seth to life in fantastic ways. His logic is so simple and logical it’s funny. The things he says, the thoughts he has, and the reasons he does things build his personality in a great way. He slips the reader into his mind easily from the start, and through Scott’s writing and his narrative, the reader is often left feeling confused and shocked. His emotions are raw and unstoppable, his screw ups huge and frustrating, and his comebacks gratifying.
So I calmly try to announce that there is indeed some good news and it involves another shift, their eyes rolled back into their heads and the moaning started, I pointed out that it was good because we were actually buying the place and not another rental, they are starting to look more excited, at this point I am trying to find the words to soften the blow of Taita and they are not coming so I just simply say "it's the house I grew up in" I really don't think I need to tell you Rachelle's reaction :) However, after some discussion (?) they did come to see that this was overall better for all of us and that they now have a better inheritance from us than they would have had if we had not done this at all. Sometimes you just have to speak their language and in this case it was how many clothes they could buy when we are gone!

When my youngest son Eric was born, everything amped up a notch. Eric has Down syndrome and was extremely fragile. Failure to thrive. He nearly died and I had to be super vigilant. Suddenly I had to worry about a heart defect, thyroid fluctuations, low weight gain, and the hours of home therapies Eric needed to combat his vast developmental delays. I did this all while trying to maintain a normal life for Nathaniel and Serena. My hours of research increased tenfold. Oh, and I wasn’t allowed to mention the fact to anyone, not even family, that Eric had this major chromosomal defect — that would affect his entire live and all our lives profoundly — until he was a year old. Eric’s father wouldn’t let me.

As for the matter of whether or not my patron will ever pay for me to compete Pro-Am: I don't know. The more time that passes, the more I lose hope for it. I don't know why my patron still doesn't want me to compete Pro-Am (it's not financial; this expense would be a drop in the bucket for him, practically the equivalent of me buying a latte at Starbucks), but it is one subject which it is not appropriate for me to broach with him, so I may never know. I may be the only dancer in the history of Pro-Am that started at Bronze level and went straight through to Open Gold level (I've almost passed through Gold, and the next level after that is Open Gold) without ever once doing a Pro-Am competition. But even if I never do get to compete Pro-Am, I'm EXTREMELY GRATEFUL for having had this opportunity to go so far with my ballroom training - training that I could never have afforded on my own. My patron is kind and generous, and a gentleman who keeps an appropriate distance and has never tried any funny business. This has been an amazing journey.

I began asking Adnan how to say easy phrases in Arabic, which I wrote down in a notebook. Fawzy, a friend of Adnan’s, also took it upon himself to try to teach me some Arabic as well. He even taught me to sing a beautiful love song in Arabic, which I still remember to this day. One of the lines from the song, loosely translated, says something like “whenever I try to speak, the only sound that comes out is your name… Your name is written on my voice.” I remember being requested to sing it a few times at some gatherings the Arabs had, and boy, did that make an impression on those in attendance. Here was this young blonde American girl singing a love song in Arabic – they loved it!

Here’s a terrible picture of the beer in question. It goes for double figures in bottles out in San Francisco, and I’m sure everywhere else - $16.99 is a typical price. It’s made by FIRESTONE WALKER, under their confusing NECTAR ALES brand – the same folks who make that hemp beer that I actually like. It’s a super-dark, very strong black ale. BLACK XANTUS is a succulent Russian Imperial stout, with light carbonation. The dominant flavors are vanilla and bourbon – whoa, lots of bourbon. Truly, it’s almost cocktail-like, and it lacks a lot of the richness and “meaty” quality I like in beers of this ilk. I’d call it a true beer lover’s beer, but as a beer lover I found it just a tiny disappointing. In conversation with others, reactions are all over the map – some think it’s the second coming, others think it’s a whole lot of nothing. Me, I call it a 7/10.
Now I would love to put it down to a natural human instinct to revel in the torment of others (fictional characters being easier of course) or the instinct that most people feel to stare for painstaking minutes on end at car accidents as they are passed on the roads. But this experience I put down to an appreciation of the author’s ability to create characters so inherently complex that one becomes confused on a fundamental moral level as to where the antagonist fits into the entire plot. Now perhaps it is just me (though I am disinclined to agree with this hasty assumption) but the clear antagonist of the tale, the obvious “bad guy” as it were, the gentleman proudly walking through page after page sporting his massive black top-hat, was my personal favoured character by page 250, and had my deepest sympathies and affection as his part in the story drew to a close and our beloved heroine, Lanny, bricked him up in a wall in favour of a man who would never truly love her. Despite his glaring inadequacies as a trustworthy individual (okay, perhaps I am downplaying the sheer wickedness of the character to an extent), Adair expressed love toward Lanore. A possessive love certainly. Perhaps some might even call it a display of ownership rather than love itself. But really, isn’t that what most people in love feel?

Most emigrants jumped off around mid-April. At this time of year, these frontier towns teemed with people and wagons and livestock.

According to the report, there has been little change in the composition of the federal work force over the years. In FY 2010, there were over 2.8 million people employed by the federal government, of whom 56% were men and 44% were women. Of that total:

The performances in this movie were exactly what they were. First off, all of the bunnies (and mostly EB) were so ridiculously cute in their animation. Women will swoon. I may have swooned myself, but I’m not entirely sure what swooning is. Is that when you pass out and wake up with no pants on and covered in blood that’s not your own? EB himself had occasional moments of funniness, but almost as many occasions of annoyance. I think that’s due to Russell Brand lending his voice to the character. I’ve always felt like Russell Brand’s idea of comedy was to constantly have things coming out of your mouth and then, even if only 10% are funny or worth hearing, at least people will still leave thinking he was hilarious. What didn’t annoy me about EB was that he was a fantastic drummer. Sure, there was no good reason for him to drum in the movie, but he was animated to be good at it. James Marsden was mostly manic and over the top on his side, with a little bit of stupid mixed in, but he never really bothered me. Gary Cole was mostly an asshole through the movie.

It was not always that way. The Communist League for whom Marx and Engels wrote the Manifesto, for example, was made up almost exclusively of Artisans and small trades people. The Craft workers of the 19th Century who created the Trades Unions were more akin to today's professionals than today's ordinary workers in many ways. At the beginning of the 20th Century the Socialist Parties like the German SPD went out of their way to win over the middle class and petit-bourgeois, and of course, Lenin himself was the classic analyst and strategist for winning over that most traditional middle class – the peasantry.

They write, "Even as thousands literally die from this onslaught of Chinese junk and poison, the American economy and its workers are suffering a no-less-painful 'death to the American manufacturing base.'" They corroborate the shrinking of the manufacturing industry that I wrote about in my book: "America's apparel, textile, and wood furniture industries have shrunk to half their size - with textile jobs alone beaten down by 70%." And, "other critical industries like chemicals, paper, steel, and tires are under similar siege."

The core of these issues involves a call for better governance and greater consultation with Malaysians. This has been the central nerve of Malaysian politics since 1998-1999, as leaders who are seen to be engaging in reform win power and those who don’t lose support.

Building on what things like Evil Dead and Return of the Living Dead did in the 1980's and Shaun of the Dead and especially the Scream franchise did last decade, director and co-screenwriter Drew Goddard and producer and co-screenwriter Joss Whedon have taken tight hold of the horror genre and squeezed and twisted and folded and mutilated it until it screamed for mercy, then pushed it just a bit further until it figuratively and literally (not to give any spoilers away) came tumbling down on its own already fractured head. An elaborately structured M.C. Escher house of cards that not only deconstructs the genre in all its giddy meta-cinema glory (or gory) but also gives it the kick in the ass wake-up call it has so desperately needed for oh so long. This ladies and gentlemen, is The Cabin in the Woods. For those in the more self-aware camp of moviegoers (i.e. the film geeks and cinephiles among us) this film should delight and entice. For those looking for your typical horror flick, good luck.

An intriguing and unexpected comment from a Facebook friend who has followed my blog inspired today’s post. After saying some very nice things about my writing, she asked me, “Did you feel a sense of synchronicity when you met Traci? I’m extremely intrigued by the theory of synchronicity and ‘feel’ that it has a tendency to play its hand in fate and destiny. If you have a story to share I would love to hear it.” Well, I do have a story to share, actually several stories, and a confession to make. But first, I’d like to examine the question: what is synchronicity, anyway? From Wikipedia:

There are pieces by established and up and coming scholars.

The King 2Hearts gathered great expectations even before it started to air, as it was to be a collaboration between producer Lee Jae Gyu of Damo and Ha Ji Won, and Lee Seung Gi had left both KBS2’s 1 Night, 2 Days and SBS’Strong Heart in order to participate in the drama. Through those variety shows, Lee Seung Gi had already become the Nation’s little brother with his relatable ‘clumsy’ image. The dramas Famous Princesses, Shining Inheritance and My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, which he took on while he was at the same time appearing in variety, added onto his reputation when they became great hits. The King 2Hearts, which he gave his full concentration after leaving all of his shows, however, is slipping ever farther away from the top, and viewership ratings continue to drop.
The hangover went, but my confidence took a plunging nose dive. No longer writing everyday, absorbed in the thing I love to do more than anything, no longer sure I was good at anything at all. My tutors were great and tried to reassure me, but I couldn’t stop the niggling little voice in my head that told me I wasn’t good enough every time I opened my laptop to write. I lost the nerve to read at Inky Fingers and pulled out of the open mic slot, so sure I was that everyone would hate whatever I read out. Although this reaction was possibly a little over the top (drama queen, moi?) I realised just how fragile my belief in my own ability to write was.

“People think that this is something that has gone away. I think there is a misconception when you are talking about workers with kids that male and female parents share equally the responsibilities for the home but many research studies have shown recently that that is not the case. While men are doing a lot more that their fathers did a generation ago, in dual career families, women are bearing the lion’s share of the caring of people in the home. But what our study showed was that even when women DID NOT have those responsibilities, their bosses felt that they still did.”

Think about it; this is a film directed Lawrence Kasdan and starring Diane Keaton, Kevin Kline, Dianne Wiest, Richard Jenkins and other pretty great actors. You’d think this would be a good movie, or at the very least a decent one, and instead we get this utterly forgettable and lifeless affair. Ugh. It sucks because these actors are still very competent even with such crappy material, and Ms. Keaton and Mr. Kline do their best at bringing some life into Beth and Joseph, a married couple; she’s super warm-hearted and yet is feeling really lonely because her husband, a back surgeon, is just this serious and uptight sort of repressed man.

The mainstream Roman Catholic Church hangs its legitimacy on unbroken lines of consecration from bishop to bishop, extending all the way back to St. Peter. Only bishops (or higher clergy) can ordain priests or consecrate other bishops – a form of organisational quality-control, as well as a narrow conduit for the divine grace that is said to be conveyed in the sacrament of ordination. Since an ordination or a consecration makes the recipient “a priest forever unto the order of Melchizadek,” a priest or bishop who later turns heretic, or otherwise runs afoul of the Church’s hierarchy, retains legitimate Orders – even if forbidden to celebrate Mass or excommunicated from the Church.
I'm not sure at what point I'll feel like a mom. Maybe it will take me as long to feel like a mom as it will for these children to call me mom.

I went home by way of Holborn, and the fog was denser than ever,— very black, indeed, more like a distillation of mud than anything else; the ghost of mud,—the spiritualized medium of departed mud, through which the dead citizens of London probably tread, in the Hades whither they are translated. So heavy was the gloom, that gas was lighted in all the shop-windows; and the little charcoal-furnaces of the women and boys, roasting chestnuts, threw a ruddy, misty glow around them. And yet I liked it. This fog seems an atmosphere proper to huge, grimy London; as proper to London, as that light neither of the sun nor moon is to the New Jerusalem.
However, that really does not have me so bothered…. because it is a money maker I see…… however..

How did this photographer get on your list? In addition to documenting the why you should also note the how. From a marketing perspective it’s good to know how people are finding you, clients, colleagues, potential employees or otherwise. Note how you found them on your list so that you can refer back when asked. You will also be able to start tracking if there are any patterns in which sources you are using have the highest rate of return (ROR) for landing a job.
Which makes me wonder who put together this website, and who at the company approved it before it went live. Surely in a company celebrating its 200th anniversary there's somebody around who sewed with their thread in the last decade or two.

Oddly, given the fact that he has now been nominated for a Tony for a supporting role (while Radcliffe was ignored), John Larroquette seemed far less engaged in the piece, speeding through his lines at times as if he were trying to catch a plane, and other times performing on cruise control. When Larroquette "woke up" once or twice in his role as J. B. Biggley, as he did in "Grand Old Ivy," he was quite charming, with both him and Radcliffe performing brilliantly. Unfortunately, director/choeographer Rob Ashford could not leave a good thing alone, bringing a whole chorus of football players to dance along, wiping away one the few enchanting character encounters.

Review your commitments both unconscious and conscious. Review your relationship to your body and if you find you have bids for power that are unreasonable, adjust them. If you find you should have had a bid for power or made some decision around a physical issue, but have not yet gotten around to it, now would be the time to do it. Some of you spend too much of your time dealing with your physical body. Some of you don’t give it the time of day. Try to find balance this month as a bid for power. Then make a commitment to do what is needed for your health and physical well being.

So what is the probability we’ll run into “X” organization? This bleeds over a bit into the “Where” area but IMHO it’s directly attributable to three things: Proximity, Visibility, and Appearance/Impression. Logically the closer you are to any given threat the more likely you are to encounter it. If your nearest town is contested between two or more violent organizations then it’s more likely you’ll encounter the one nearest you – it’s human nature to take the path of least resistance and rather than cross through and raid or attack a location those elements will most likely work outwards from their location.

A very rhythmic album, with punchy drums that seem to circle around the ranty vocals and elevating guitars. The songs are very much construed like any of today's popular anthemic indie rock songs, but something sets this band apart. Maybe it's just connecting with me more than your average indie rock, but every piece of the music is done very well here and it all fits together in a very pure and groovy way. It's almost like a jazz album in the way each instrument has its distinctive role in a complex, yet coalesced whole. It is a meticulously crafted, clearly post-punk influenced album brought up through a modern indie rock context that deserves to be thought of as one of the decade's highlights. - Matthew Foster

To do this, measure the same as for the bottom, but make your 'dot mark' a little closer to the edge. To rephrase that, instead of marking at exactly the 1 inch mark on the ruler, mark the 9/10ths mark. I find that is usually enough.

His robot is strange. They call it a ‘machine-man’, though it is clearly feminine. It stands, walks, extends its silver hand to Joh, who recoils. But in its blank eyes he sees potential—a being who can sow dissention among the workers, and justify a crackdown. Joh and Rotwang descend to the catacombs and spy upon Maria delivering one of her sermons. She recounts the story of the Tower of Babel—and the two schemers fail to see the point of that story, or Maria’s obvious value in preventing revolt. Instead, they plot to discredit Maria by replacing her with the robot, in her likeness. The robot will use Maria’s authority to preach a new message of chaos. Joh departs. Rotwang considers taking things further.

Everyone knows the economy is lousy, and has been for the last several years. But our liberal friends ask us what, exactly, the Republicans will do to make it better. The answer is complex, of course, and includes several long-term issues. But I always say that there are two obvious areas of low-hanging fruit: energy policy and regulation. A new administration could give our economy a quick and substantial boost by encouraging, rather than blocking, the development of America’s vast energy resources, and by stopping the promulgation of endless regulations that burden business and, by imposing needless costs, make us all poorer. The Obama administration has been destroying wealth through irrational regulation at an unprecedented, and accelerating rate, as depicted in these charts from an earlier post:
“So please, after a week of name-calling, socio-political commentaries and jokes, let’s all just forget those so-called ‘conservative’ OWC,” said Khairul, ending the conference after hearing his mom call his name. “We the Obedient Kids Club are definitely more conservative and less progressive. We make it our goal to curb all kinds of freedom yearned by children around the world, from TV to Playstation, from girl- and boy-friends to questioning whatever our obviously smarter adults say. The media focus should be on us! People should be enraged by this club’s very existence!

This salsa came out mild to medium which was perfect for the whole family. I like a bit spicier salsa, so if you like really spicy, you may want to add more jalapenos, but as is, this recipe should be mild enough for most.

I always feel a little inward rebellion when someone talks about a “Proverbs 31” woman. The woman described in that chapter is too good to be true, like the superwomen described in magazines displayed at the supermarket checkouts. I can’t relate to anyone who can hold down a full time job, keep a perfect house, serve perfect meals, raise perfect children, and still have the energy to fulfill all her husband’s fantasies. No, I think was missed a few of those classes along with the presentation classes I wrote about earlier in the week. But Proverbs 31:13 says She…works with eager hands, and that’s a pretty good description of Mom’s hands. She was probably taught that idle hands are the devil’s workshop, and she took that teaching to heart.

Or do you prefer a soft, silky, ethereal feel of the water? This is usually my preference. If so, you want a slow shutter speed. I shoot waterfalls, depending on the light, anywhere from 1/2 second to 1.6 seconds, using a low ISO. But how can you shoot this slowly?

He was amazingly good - first of all we were in a new place. Then there were bikes, horses, cows, dogs fetching sticks in water, and model planes. The trail head is near the model airplane airport and there was a plane flying. At the end we could see Boulder Reservoir. Tetley looked and looked at that - not in a fearful way at all but curious, wanting to know more.
At the Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima, workers have been risking their lives to save the worst case scenario. They all are on a suicide mission.

Another positive aspect of the show was the fact that the character introductions for this series only spans across two episode. Whilst the character introduction process usually tend to be on the tedious side for most series, this series had managed to ease through this stage of things by placing the focus on the mystery whilst integrating the characters into the situation in an almost normal manner by having the mystery play-out around Oreki instead of giving the other characters too much attention.
This may not sit well with my fellow Ranger Fans, but winning a Stanley Cup this season has not obsessed me. It never really has. Not this season. And I stressed that numerous times over the season; especially near the trade deadline. I do not say this because I lack confidence in this team. To the contrary, we've shown we can beat just about all comers. I just do not believe that's where we are yet. We had a plan. I believe in the plan. We stuck to that plan. And it's up to us to follow through with that plan to the very end. And I specifically mean that for us Fans especially. At the moment, the rebuilding of the Rangers is near complete; but not fully complete. So don't go getting all bent out of shape if things don't go our way. This team is being built for future long term success; not just tonight.
Brown the ground beef with the onions. Drain grease if there is any. Combine all of the other ingredients except for toppings. Bring to a boil in a large pan, then simmer for about 30 minutes. Serve with toppings.
I feel, already, that I am an important member of the team and have not been one of the unlucky ones from my course who will have a brain-numbing experience. In total, I will be working at the office for 4 weeks and am hoping to do more with CommsConsult and the team whenever other opportunities arise.
My five year relationship ended, I can no longer trust, feel comfortable or believe what we had was real because he broke our bond, my trust, and my soul when I found out who he really was. I said I would never allow anyone to change my love, but he did. I have not been the same since. I used to be light, care feel, optimistic, believing the world will be good to you if you set out to only put positive things into. When my relationship came crushing down, I had no one I could go to and talk about my feelings with. I kept everything inside for months and I grew bitter, angry, suspicious that everyone who smiled in my face was hurting me behind my back.

I’m shocked. Shocked, I tell you. Worse yet, it seems Nancy Brinker has not yet come to terms with the harm she has done to her foundation:
There are many moments in life we wish we could get back. When you threw the ball in the house and it just missed the open hands of your sister to break your mom’s favorite lamp. Those hurtful words you said to your girlfriend in anger. The brilliant plan to see if your homemade wings could actually sail you to safety as you leap from the roof. That time you put your foot in your mouth when trying to make a good first impression. All momentary lapses in reason. Quick . . . and painful. Your mom’s wrath, the crushed look on your girlfriend’s face, your broken leg(s), your utter embarrassment.
But the Thinkers are unusually persuasive, and they're set on convincing Vi to become one of them...starting by brainwashing Zenn. Vi can't leave Zenn in the Thinkers' hands, but she's wary of joining the rebellion, especially since that means teaming up with Jag. Jag is egotistical, charismatic, and dangerous--everything Zenn's not. Vi can't quite trust Jag and can't quite resist him, but she also can't give up on Zenn.
I did find the keys obviously. And my phone. I popped the trunk with the key fob and climbed out, just as someone walked by (of course). My pants were on backwards and my shirt was all twisted and my hair was a mess.

Bayern were the more deserved team over the two legs, they carried more of a threat on the flanks and had a more adept midfield trio, here Mourinho failed. Heynckes had Gustavo as a destroying defensive midfielder, Schwienstieger as the link man with his running and Kroos with his passing link-play behind Gomez at the tip. Madrid meanwhile, didn’t have a designated holder between Alonso and Khedira, the German desires to move forward whilst the Spaniard is a passer. Mesut Ozil, at the front of the 3, is similar to Kroos, though with much-less defensive discipline, heightening the need for Khedira to support the space off him and in-turn, exposing Alonso. Against Bayern’s creaky defence, Ozil’s creativity was understandable to be included, but Gustavo was superb over both legs and Granero would have been a safer bet.
When she untied him, he immediately put his right fist down his throat. She picked him up and began to coo to him. “Well, little man. What do you think you are doing with that fist? Open up and show me what you are holding so tightly.”
UPDATE: Bible Version Question: I researched various translations as much as possible, although the sheer amount of opinion on the subject is a mite overwhelming. To the best of my knowledge, the ESV and NIV were both translated from the original Hebrew and Greek, so I plan on using them (although I’ll be reading them online, so I may do some comparison with several different versions). My understanding is that the Apocrypha was in the KJV until the late 1800s, or early 1900s. Do you include them in your Bible? Why or why not? Which version do you prefer?

Not exactly “new” music, but here’s an unreleased demo of Janis Joplin’s classic “Me & Bobbe McGee” done as a solo acoustic. You can hear it, and read about “The Pearl Sessions” and an interview with her sister here.
She also smoked around friends who smoked, but only when they were actually smoking. It was clearly a social thing for her, and there was no addiction, or – and this is the first time I’ve ever thought of this – maybe it was a passive aggressive way of pricking Dad. Why does that make me smile? I guess because, like many men in the fifties and sixties, he was “The Man” of the house. Golly, this is a revelation as I’m writing it.
Rondo, who was suspended once during the regular season for his conduct concerning an official, finally spoke to reporters about his ejection from the Celtics’ 83-74 Game 1 loss to the Hawks on Sunday night. He was thrown out of the game for bumping official Mark Davis in the final minute, but has stood by his story that he did not bump him intentionally.
And I can’t watch these brilliant, gifted women assume the fullness of their roles in the kingdom of God is only available in the room where there are no men present. It’s too painful. It makes me angry.
Since forming in 2003, The Safes have released their debut LP Family Jewels, a follow-up EP Boogie Woogie Rumble, and 2007’s LP Well Well Well to great success. The Safes first three releases have earned widespread critical acclaim. These features and glowing reviews in such notable publications as Washington Post, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, Pitchfork, Paste, and Popmatters (to name a few) lead to packed shows in major cities all over the USA.
And I was. Very careful. Public places. People knew where I was. Who I was meeting. It should have been fine. It should have just been the once. But no, I’ve not been able to keep away. I’ve had to go back for more, and more. I hoped this last one would be the one to finish it off. The one to expose the situation for what it was. After all the first time I met him he used a pseudonym so I should have known. But something tells me its not going to stop. Its bad; I’m married, he’s married. He’s got kids for goodness sake.

At first, I could not quite figure out what the sound was and then I saw the woman standing in my elderly neighbor's tiny little flowery weed patch out in front of the house. She had her arm buried shoulder deep in the Meyer lemon tree and the cracking sound was a branch heavy with fruit snapping off in her hands. Admittedly, the tree is about 2 inches from the sidewalk and the fruit was covering every square inch in a very tantalizing manner. But to stride through a stranger's flower garden crushing the plants below to break off a large branch of a tree to get to fruit that does not belong to you seemed like more than just innocent enjoyment of nature. And beyond trespassing. It pissed me off so quickly and thoroughly before I really had a chance to think things out, I called out to her. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"

The conflict in Mali is certainly multi-causal. It would be foolish to suggest otherwise. Had Qadhafi remained in power, a Tuareg rebellion may well still have broken out in Mali at some point. But just because an event is multi-causal does not mean the importance of one of those causes should be minimized. As Dan Murphy writes, “What seems clear is that the timing of all this is inextricably linked to events last year in Libya.” Events did not have to play out in this way and to take the particularly chaotic form they did.
Just because most Americans aren’t familiar with the metric system… a grain of rice weighs between 20-30 milligrams. A ten gallon tank is roughly 30 liters. So if ammonia equivalent to the mass of ten grains of rice is added to a roughly 10 gallon tank, there is a 50% chance of killing every fish in the tank. That’s not a lot of ammonia. If your tank already has nitrate problems, then the mass of ammonia needed drops… a lot.

According to Dr. Maiwald, since using the invention as the search criterion for finding the "starting point" invariably favours a hindsight analysis, the analysis normally starts from the problem (left to be overcome in the prior art) both as described or implied (e.g. by the discussion of disadvantages of the prior art) in the specification.

Not until the boom in the use of smaller computers of the 1980s did the NTDS start to face obsolescence. Development of successor systems began in the mid 1980s, and by the mid 1990s, a variety of cheaper, faster, smaller and lighter systems began to replace it. Today several high bandwidth data links working in conjunction with advanced versions of the computer systems used in NTDS perform the battle management function.

Christians today need to stand strong against the "redefining" of worship to mean whatever man thinks it should mean. God speaks about the worship He demands; it is wise for us to read what He has given us.

Pour the lime filling evenly into the completely cooled crust. Bake for 15 minutes or until the center is set but still 'jiggly' when shaken (yes, that's a precise, official cooking term).

I also can’t control how loudly God speaks to me and what kind of blessings I have. I can’t control how or when He talks to me and I can’t control what He will do in relationship with me. I don’t have a predictable “if…then” relationship with Him. In fact, I’m learning a whole lot about just how much I am not like Him and how very much He is not operating inside any kind of predictable formula.

I am still in shock. I went out to breakfast with my parents on Sunday and told them. We were ordering drinks and my dad asked me if I wanted coffee, or a mimosa or something, and I said, “No I can’t have coffee or alcohol anymore.” I started smiling and they finally got that this wasn’t due to some new diet I was trying. My mom instantly started crying and my dad was thrilled. Of course he tried unsuccessfully to be reassuring by saying: “Don’t worry, even if you have another miscarriage, it doesn’t mean anything is wrong. My coworker’s daughter just had a baby and she had several miscarriages before this pregnancy.” Thanks Dad, but reassurance fail. I don’t care though, I’m too excited.
