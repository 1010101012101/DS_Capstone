Use the same diligence you channel into your writing when seeking a grant. The best reward for landing one of these jewels is that one award perpetuates another. Funders put heavy stock in a previous grant win. But like finding the right publisher and nailing a great magazine feature, you must match your needs with theirs. Both of you have a desire to succeed--and when you connect, it's a match made all the way to the bank.

Buildings within the site later were later named after trees, with the original building becoming The Laurels, East (former male side) and The Laurels, West (former female side).

The more time Cade spends with Leah, the deeper he falls in love. To Cade, she’s an angel who’s saved his life and given him the sense of hope he’s never known. But he’s not the man she thinks he is, and before he can find permanent shelter in Leah’s arms, he must learn to have faith and put his former sins to rest…

Google has become such a facet of my everyday life that I am not quite sure how big of an effect that it would have on my life if it were to suddenly cease to exist. I use it every day for both work and personal life. If I need a phone number – Google! If I need directions – Google! If I want assistance in locating someones house using photos that I found on their Facebook account so that I can watch them take out their trash from my tinted car windows – Google!

Nikka's Yoichi Distillery is located on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. Founded in 1934, Yoichi is Nikka's signature single malt. While less well known abroad, the Miyagikyo Distillery in northern Honshu is the same size as Yoichi but it makes both malt and grain whisky. Miyagikyo has not only made single malt but a popular series of single grain whiskeys labeled as Nikka Coffey Still (though these were originally produced from Nikka's now defunct grain distillery Nishinomiya). Miyagikyo is in the area that was affected by last year's earthquake and tsunami, but luckily escaped without injury, serious damage or ill effects from fallout, according the Christopher Bunting of Nonjatta.
LiveLikeYou was created because I wanted to make design available to people who can't afford an interior designer. Most people go to the major retailers when designing a home, PB, Ikea etc. they are not sure what to buy, so they buy something safe..like a beige couch. And they're often insecure about what color to paint the wall, or they don't have time to deal with it- so they pick something safe like beige, or never paint because the simply can't make a decision. And go on living like like every body

The problem with having a large space is that while cleaning I always get distracted by the fun stuff and end up making a bigger mess, instead of cleaning up the original mess....this problem keep multiplying until I can't move anymore and I end up on the dining room table.

Like some kind of giant Lego set, the station is made up of distinctive blocks which surround an inner exercise yard, with each section serving a specific function. There are five storeys of residential apartments (40 flats in all) located above the workshops and garages, which house a dozen emergency vehicles. The apartment block sits on a series of columns, making for a physical separation between it and ground level which isn't necessarily visible at first sight. To the rear of the building, a number of parallel spiral staircases provide a dizzying means of access to each level.

stages. The original version was written without Adam's POV, actually. The original was completely from Ellory's POV. And it didn't work that way. I kept reading through it and felt something was missing and everyone else who read it always wound up hating Adam. So I knew I had to add him in. He is a very bad boy, lol, but there is also a good side to him and I wanted the readers to be able to see that. If his POV wasn't there, how would the readers be able to like him or sympathize with him at all? I don't think they would be able to. He's already a very dark character and it’s hard to like someone like that without seeing or reading about what's going on in their head. Also, the book began with Ellory's POV too. Then I switched it. I thought the opening would have a much bigger impact if I started it with Adam's POV. And apparently, according

I know there are quite a few combo collector's out there that collect sports cards and comic books. If you're lucky enough to live somewhere with a good comic book store this Saturday is Free Comic Book day. I'm lucky enough to have one of these great stores very close to me and I've made the trek to Free Comic Book Day almost every year for the last 6 or 7 years now. There are some great freebies given out and most stories hold other promotions and sales on that day as well.
I'm enjoying a beautiful morning here at the Jammi Homestead...the sun is shining and the air is filled with the crispness of early Spring. That of course, is outside the house, where I am not. My beautiful morning consists of starting the workday by gazing at my bank of monitors and getting ready for a day of reporting comparisons - which can actually be fun, except that after an hour of peering at the screens, my eyes are begging to be punched out. Soon, I'll hear my contractor hammering away and the crack of 2x4s falling. The smell of sheetrock dust will again be in the air. Sheetrock dust, in case you don't know is like sin, it clings to everything and it goes everywhere, no matter how hard you try to contain it...it is impossible.

Just a couple nights later I was back "home" working with another nurse in caring for an unstable patient. Blood pressure propped up with several continuous IV medications, multiple blood products needed, an air leak in one lung causing massive accumulation of air under the skin, no neurological response to painful stimuli hours after surgery - very sick patient. The air leak was the most immediate striking. Because his lung wasn't completely sealed like in a normal person, every "breath" delivered by the ventilator caused some air to leak into the body cavity resulting in subcutaneous emphysema. Chest tubes inserted in his chest were helping drain fluid and air, but couldn't keep up. So air accumulated in the chest, then made it's way down the arms and up the neck to his face.

Quote from Dr. Vandana Shiva:
I felt the contractions deep inside of my body, the spasms that pumped my hot liquid passion like a fire hose onto her belly. I usually cum in thick heavy streams but this stream was heavier than most. The pulsing seemed to go on forever as I spurted all over her belly, covering it with my cream. When it was done my prostate was aching and empty. I was done.
Part of the reason I don't stamp humans often is that the images can be too realistic, not realistic enough or just creepy! But these have a Campbell's Soup / vintage look that I love.

We've had our fair share of moving experiences. Mostly good, but probably more than we'd care to have. We moved into our first house in February of 2000. In January of 2004, we moved out of state when I began my first ministry in Ohio. I think it was fourteen months later that we moved into a different house there in Ohio, only to move again eighteen months after that.

It's possible that Gower can be viewed as artist stand-in in Pericles, but he is far less successfully integrated into the play than, say, Prospero is in The Tempest; and if we view the magic of Prospero in the latter play as a gloss or comment on the "magic" of well-constructed literary art, or any art — as critics have done for quite some time, viewing Prospero's vow to give up his magic as Shakespeare's own farewell to writing plays — we learn a whole lot more about art than we do from Gower's clumsy rhyming and rudimentary stage-managing.

I would perhaps develop my comment in this way: that two artists would focus on the same type of gendered color coding of endless amounts of cheap every day commodities is an indicator of a general situation, but if one knows that the other did the --visually identical -- work of discovery and research already, what is her responsibility to the earlier artist?Holland Cotter praised the "impressive debut"of Portia Munson's first NYC solo gallery show in 1994.

There's always been a sort of 50/50 love-hate affection I've had with tribute bands, but when your long time favorite band is slowly dying off, sometimes you have no other choice, especially when you long to hear that music amplified to a live capacity. I've seen The Pink Floyd Experience twice: four years ago in Huntington, West Virginia and roughly one year ago while residing in Louisville. Both sets where sensually satisfying, but not because they played "Wish You Were Here"- in fact, they didn't play it at all. They were satisfying because they took time to cover virtually every era of Floyd, cascading from the late Division Bell to the ancient jam tune known as "Astronomy Domine." No Floyd was left behind. So after seeing this band twice, I've had pretty high expectations when it comes to these kinds of concerts.

First of all, after MUCH debate, we decided to install the stove in the corner of the kitchen, blowing inward to the rest of the house. I was a little worried about placing it there because there is a wall between the kitchen and the rest of the house. I was concerned that the heat might stay all bottled up in the kitchen and wouldn't make it adequately into the rest of the house, even though we did aim the blower toward the doorway. When I finally realized that the BHE meant for the stove to be our ONLY heat source (I was under the insane delusion that we still might use the furnace on occasion - you know, if we got chilly or something) I begged him to tear the dividing wall down completely.

Many people think Eurovision is essentially a straight up political contest, a game taken far too seriously by most of the entrants. This is not entirely accurate.
More importantly, this section specifically states that the “(f)ailure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided, upon motion and after hearing.” This will obviate the former practice of some trial courts in allowing amendment of the incomplete pleading for the incorporation therein of the certificate against forum shopping. That was erroneous since this undertaking against multiple filing of cases is not part of the operative facts required to be alleged in an initiatory pleading, such as allegations on the cause of action, but is a special requirement for admission of the initiatory pleading for filing in court, hence the absence thereof is not curable by mere amendment.

She has us all on a roller coaster wondering what on earth we are going to do for her. Talks between Dr. R and our cardiologist are being had, one of our frustrations is whether or not we can really do anything for Lucy cardiac wise. We are looking for some guidance as to how high is too high for her heart rates and how long is too long to let them be high. Pain continues to be a growing issue, Drew and I witness on a daily basis just how strong our little one is when it comes to pain.

Day #5 of my pointlessly self-imposed vegetarian week.
So Jake and I were convinced that yesterday was Jaxon's big day! Around 10am I started having the most painful cramps ever that were radiating from my back to my front. There was a constant pain but there'd be waves of just extra stabbing pain. I started timing the contractions and they were about 5 minutes apart by the time we left for the hospital. We got there a couple hours after my contractions started. They sent me to the triage center and I was put on two different monitors, one for Jax's heart rate and another to track my contractions. They got closer together at the hospital, about two minutes apart but there wasn't a clear pattern to them. The contractions also weren't changing my cervix any so after 3-4 hours of being in the hospital they said since I wasn't progressing that they were going to send me home. The nurse thinks I'm in early early labor and all I need is just one little push and I'll be in active labor quickly. I was dilated about the same when I got checked. She said I was at 3 cm, so I guess that's better than 2-3 cm. I was a little disappointed to go to the hospital this late in the pregnancy and not come home with my baby boy.

The Master Bath happens to have the best view in the house, the Hollywood sign and downtown Los Angeles. So I convinced my client that we definitely had to remodel the master bath for obvious reasons but also it was in the back of the house and it would not be a good idea to remodel the whole house, install wood floors, paint, etc without redoing the master bath. He finally saw the light and agreed!

The cinematography serves the leads as it does with Rick’s establishment, the glitters from dresses worn near the bar and casino and the darkness when the patrons have all disappeared. The symmetry of these deep shadows evoke noir techniques I’ve seen in British romance movies of the era, where the love can forbidden despite the lack of guns. And unlike noirs where the men’s silhouettes haunt the alleyways and doors, the chiaroscuro stays indoors and somehow the frame doesn’t make me feel cagey. These sequences also reminds me of Curtiz’ later work in Mildred Pierce.
Those are my worst offenders. Every now and again, I will add another temporarily (“like” for instance, used as in “I was like, you know, like nearly there”).
very well, but if you do that is to have a new approach. Talk to her friends. You know what it’s gonna hurt and shutdown but you tried and if you don’t how would you know? So ask her friends. If you get a little indication that she likes you. If you talk to her friends you’ll get a positive response. You may ask her out or just text back and forth while email just really get to know, make sure that’s she’s comfortable because you could scare her away if you ask her out too soon.

...when I was a wee lad, my father tried to teach me to football. He did at least succeed in giving me a love for the sport that I have for no other, not even the ones I actually did play well (like tennis or track). An unintended consequence was that a phrase he gave me while trying to show me the intracicies of defending and tackling in the open field became a great life lesson:
Or he would be fired.
I mentioned in a previous post my severe dislike for Facebook. This dislike still remains, but yet again, I have an account. I’m not proud of this fact, but if I want to stay in touch with certain people, Facebook is a necessary evil. I am being EXTREMELY choosy as to who I allow to be my friend on Facebook. People who are on there now are people I am interested in, want to talk to often, or just generally enjoy what they have to say. Not to say that people I don’t allow aren’t my friends; I would happily chat with them down the pub for example, but chances are they’re not going to engage with me online – I’d be just another number. Also people I know who will absolutely upset me get binned straight away. There’s one now waiting in my inbox for such a fate – do I have any interest in their life? In some respects, yes I do, but do I need to hear about his perfect life/girlfriend/whatever – absolutely not. I don’t understand why every time we speak he feels the need to tell me about what his girlfriend is up to. I don’t know her. I don’t care to know her. Shut up. I may be somewhat jealous of her, yes, I’m not ashamed to admit that but going online is meant to be a leisurely pursuit, not a constant trigger to push my mental health buttons. This may make me sound crazy, but having an on/off sexual relationship with someone over 6 years which is now definitely 100% off, being aware of someone who is good enough girlfriend material just makes me feel awful. I have no time for this. I am great in my own ways, and maybe, at some point in the future, someone else may see that too.
Busby said she thinks her musical influences and her choice of work are connected. "I'm a trained historian and I'm very interested in these lovely bits of social history that you get in many of the songs. I especially like the ballads that were sung at executions. They're very sentimental and for me that's a rich seam. I like the stories about ordinary people's lives, about the sad and happy things that happen to them. The unrequited loves and the snapshots you might get of the life of an ordinary serving girl, for instance."
If you read this really fast, you'll get an idea of what it sounded like as these words spilled out in excitement from Lance, "It's a DS!!! Wow, I can't believe you guys got me a new one. Well, look, it's not new but it works right? I thought I was NEVER going to get another one since I left mine out in the sun and then you fixed it and then I did something else to my one they fixed and now it won't turn off and freezes all the time. WOWOWOW! Man, I'm going to have to get use to the power button. Thanks guys! I promise to take care of it." (He'd been waiting about a year...saving up his money and then buying Lego's instead. )

Overall, I’d say our special teams haven’t performed as well as we would have liked. While Brandon Boykin and Branden Smith have both made tremendous contributions, we also gave up a punt return for a touchdown (albeit due to a bit of trickeration) as well as a fake punt for a touchdown against Sakerlina. We’ve also gotten away with couple of mental lapses during the fielding of punts. But, hey, that’s why we have practice.

The resolution passes and the sentiments pendulum between unapologetic apathy and ignorant rage. I am disgusted, as hate is spewed towards the United States and India. A cricketing rivalry with the latter turned vitriolic against its supportive stance on the resolution. India raised the LTTE, someone announces to cyberspace. Or perhaps it was such anger and ignorance directed at a section of our own people.

The funny thing is I had all the intentions of telling a doctor on Wed, but when I got in there I froze, then got told off because I’d used an emergency appointment when it wasn’t an emergency. It is to me, because if I just make a regular one, I’ll probably still back out. I thought with saying it was an emergency I had a better chance of spitting it out.
I'm excited to be working with my original Matilda Jane Trunk Keeper who has become a trusted friend of mine and elated to have found something where I am able to stay home with my daughter during the day and run a business in the evenings and weekends. I am looking forward to all the wonderful new people I am going to meet and the new experiences ahead of me - I feel very blessed with this opportunity. I hope you join me on this journey - I would love to make you a happy Jane with those awesome benefits!

As far as food is concerned, he is getting a little more picky. Mainly, he's refusing bread! Any bread- pita, cornbread, sandwich bread, etc. It's okay to boycott bread, I suppose, as it's not full of nutrients he really needs, but it just seems odd to me. I mean really, who doesn't like bread!?

And just a note about my "mailable" cards as I've had a few comments and questions on them. I KNOW that I can mail some of my more embellished cards by backing them with a scrap piece of cardstock or taking them to the PO to see if they fit through the template BUT I don't always have time to mess with that, especially going to the PO so I like to have some cards that I know I can pop in an envie and mail off from home without worry of them coming back to me or being damaged. Plus, our PO seems to be rather strict about any cards with lumps or bumps and always wants to charge me extra postage. I even had one lady scratch through the envelope trying to find out what the "bump" was one time...it was just something popped up on dimensionals:( So, these are all cards that can be mailed without a second thought. I even do mail some of my heavily embellished cards using our padded envies but only when I have time to go to the PO.
And, of course, someone made it into a musical. Then Showtime made that musical into a movie. The film starts with a group of concerned parents assembling at Benjamin Harrison High School to watch a film being screened by the Lecturer (Alan Cumming, as the film’s Greek chorus). The film-within-the-film deals with upstanding young teenage couple Jimmy Harper (Christian Campbell) and Mary Lane (Kristen Bell). Across town the slick pot dealer Jack (Steven Weber) runs a reefer den out of the house of his “girlfriend” Mae (Ana Gasteyer). Some of the addicts that live in the den are maniacal college dropout Ralph (John Kassir, best known as the voice of the Cryptkeeper in Tales from the Crypt) and “reefer slut” Sally (Amy Spanger). Jimmy’s innocent world and Jack’s depraved one soon collide as Jimmy is pulled into a downward spiral of fiendish reefer addiction. Musical numbers ensue.

Another proposed definition that is infuriating NAFA and other groups was one for “swaps,” which could characterize some annuities and life insurance products as securities swaps. That would likely mean a completely different distribution for those products—and producers would have to have a securities license to sell them.

“My father and Mr. Hatfield, a neighbor, would wait until there was about six inches of clear ice, usually in February. Dad would bring our team and wagon alongside the pond and, using the same crosscut saw we used for winter wood, cut the ice in big slabs. They slid the ice up 4x4s onto the wagon, then took it to the ice house, which was adjacent to the road. After about three or four loads, the ice house was filled. More straw was placed amongst the ice blocks and laid on top.”

After this point, Wisdom 13 goes back to the subject of the idolaters, and how miserable their religious situation is. Tackling the issue of idolatry is one of the major focuses of the later prophetical writings, as well as much of the book of Wisdom. So if you want to know the answer to the questions raised in the above paragraph then I think you have to jump to Romans 1, where Paul writes about knowing God through creation, and affirms the idea here in Wisdom 12-13 that ignorance is foolishness, and therefore inexcusable.
The book is filled with candid conversations about informal dinners with Sir Winston Churchill, conversations with Nikita Kruschev, Indira Gandhi, Charles de Gaulle, and so many more. Apparently Kruschev was a clown and a joker, and it was difficult to have a conversation with him, he joked around so much. Who knew. President Kennedy was particularly fond of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, and they were very close friends, but neither President nor Jacqueline Kennedy liked Indira Gandhi. These people are all icons of the 20th Century, and Jacqueline chats about them casually as if they were the folks down the street. It's wonderful.
IT equipments were rarely monitored for their energy consumption. The efficiency of system administrators and other IT people is decided by the availability and performance of IT Infrastructure. They are responsible for meeting the performance SLAs and availability around 99.99% in complex 24 X 7 environments. That is the reason that monitoring focus is mainly on these aspects of the Infrastructure and most of the metrics being captured by native utilities or third-party tools fall into availability or performance categories.

Things have been moving full throttle in the summer... after the baby got over a bout of cold and cough... it was the hub and the MIL that followed suit.

His partner called dispatch to get some paramedics out for the girl even though she didn’t seem in immediate distress. That was a huge ‘yet’. Then he bent to lean and put himself at the girl’s level. “Hi there” he put a hand out to help her up “I’m Officer Levins. I’m gonna get you safe inside okay?

They did tell us that they didn't want their bunkbeds together anymore so they each have their own seperate beds now.
I hate how I feel, I hate that I want to barf all day long, I hate that my doctor told me I need to increase my calories and I can't because I can't eat. It doesn't sound good it doesn't feel good. My muscles ache so much these days like I can't walk properly. My arms ache and my stomach HURTS. I am torn because my doctor is considering lowering my chemo dose because he doesn't think I am handling the side effects too well. But then I worry the chemo won't work right and feel like I'm failing these dumb drugs too. I feel like I am stuck in a poor little old lady's body. I am only 34 and I am sad because I just want more littles and I want to have more energy, and I want want want. I want none of THIS (STOMP STOMP STOMP)

I am reposting this piece from almost one year ago. Simply, because the continued feedback I am receiving from authors who have used, or are in the process of using this publisher's services, have continued to be negative. I see no evidence through the communications I have had with Raider authors, who have contacted me, that the promises made from this publisher to address the issues they highlighted - this time last year - are being properly addressed. This is the very first time in the three years of POD, Self-Publishing & Independent Publishing that I am personally not advising authors to use their services.

Before the world began, there was God and Heaven and the holy angels. Beneath God’s Heaven was a chaos without form and void with darkness upon the face of the deep. Where did this darkness come from, this chaos, this void that sounds like the bottom-less pit and is a description, really, of hell?? How did hell beneath Heaven, this void, this chaos, this bottom-less pit description of darkness on the face of the deep void… how did it come into being?? What do we know from God’s Word about history before the world began?? We know that before time began, the devil and one third of the holy angels fell to become the devil and his unholy angels –devils.
“…the time for them to understand the concept is yet to come…” Then why did God not just create humans with the ability to understand these concepts? So God wants us to believe and understand his word, but he doesn’t give us the mental capacity to do it? Doesn’t make much sense.
As we travel through our time here on earth, there are going to be storms that ravage our lives. Some will blow in fast without a lot of warning and unleash their fury immediately, like the sudden loss of a family member or close friend or an unexpected job loss. On the other hand, some of life’s trials will gather slowly letting you know they are on the way like the storm that announces its impending arrival with a low rumble of thunder that progressively builds as the storm clouds blow in on the growing winds. In a similar fashion, some of life’s storms vanish almost as quickly as they arrived while some trials seem to drag on endlessly making you wonder if the rain is ever going to stop. Finally, just as storms vary in their intensity and level of destruction, our challenges will test us in different ways. Some of us will be knocked completely off our feet and have our worlds torn apart around us. In just the past couple days, I have read stories about a man who lost his entire family to a tragic auto accident, a couple who lost their five month old baby to a rare but deadly disease, and a young man who is pressing on with his life after somehow surviving two separate plane crashes that claimed the lives of his sister, brother, and mother in one accident and his father and step-mother in the most recent crash. At other times, life will push us to our limits and test the strengths of our foundations like the thousands of people who are out of work through no fault of their own and struggling to pay their bills, put food on their tables, or keep a roof over their families’ heads. Finally, we are all sure to experience the minor inconveniences and rainy days that just seem to drag us down at times. We won’t all experience the same levels of hardship, but one thing is for sure, we will all face some storms in our lives.

A lady appeared out of a hidden door. She had apparently been watching the auditions and liked me enough to come into the room and say so. I was handed a card with a callback time printed on it, along with about six of the other performers. When I got to my car, I called my mom to say that I believed I was going to be hired. After all, they were looking for twenty performers, and I had shown them that I knew what I was doing and was more than qualified for this low paying long hours quite a distance away summer job.

But in the run-up to renewal, the Obama administration dramatically reversed its stance on the bill. Not only did Barack Obama fully support the Act, sans revision, he issued an official statement requesting that it be extended for not one year, but three! The statement made clear that the President “would strongly prefer enactment of reauthorizing legislation that would extend these authorities until December 2013.”

"The one transcendent Nickelback song is the semi-acoustic "Rockstar," a dilemma for all those who want to erroneously pretend that Kroeger has no sense of irony. "Rockstar" has a faultless construction — it's simple, true, sarcastic, and aspirant. I suppose those four qualities also describe Nickelback, which is another reason why humorless people will always hate them."

Rather than spending that money on travelling expenses, we prefer to save or furnish our apartment. ;) Cakap jer takde budget.... LOL.
The other way round, if you made it to level 4, and already live a quite sophisticated life, you are respected, you are self-confident and so on, you take food for granted, and just giving you some more ordinary food will not at all make you happier.
So, in the end – how was it? It was a ton of fun, to put it simple. Relatively speaking, knowing that this only had around fifty or so episodes whilst the first had around two hundred, this was better than the first. One arc blew my mind in terms of badass scenes, and another one made me laugh like crazy. All I can say is this – if you haven’t watched the first one yet, do it. If you’ve watched the first but not yet begun to watch the continuation, do it. Both of them will always be masterpieces in my eyes, if only because no other series can make me laugh as much. It’s without a shred of doubt a must-watch in my eyes.
Along these same lines, social media expert Jason Falls simp­lifies the definition, but perhaps a little too much: “Did you get something from your audience that can make your business better?”
He also made a big deal that he couldn’t get any more specific than those vague statements because he can’t recall their conversations “verbatim.” I tried to explain the difference between verbatim and the bare minimum. He still didn’t get it. I gave him several examples. I said if you asked me what Transformers was about I could tell you it was a movie about cars that turned into robots. That is the quick, 5 second recap. But there are plenty of other things I could tell you about the plot, how the story progressed, what happened, the sequence of events, etc. without repeating the script of the movie word for word. He still claimed that he had no idea what I meant. He said that my example made no sense, and that the short summary he told me was “everything.” I disagreed whole-heartedly.
author and I do not want you to think for one minute that having faith in in Jesus Christ is all that there is to the “Christian” life. God forbid it. Quite the contrary is true. The person who has found favor with God through faith in Jesus Christ will manifest a transformed life in that there will be works produced…but the works are not done to earn God’s favor, but rather, they are done out of love for him and for all he has done for us and given us

The Girl is studying this for A-level Eng.Lit and as part of my clinging-on-for-dear-life-to-the-past mentality, I got my own copy (we're even on the same page at the moment - how vicarious can you get?!) so we can, as the exams ask, 'discuss'. And I'm actually quite liking it. I've even read all the Foreword and the background and the Bio on Bram Stoker and (typical of me) very much liked the way he seemed to be a closet homosexual who pretended to take as his girlfriend, every sister of whichever male obsession he was currently... well, obsessed with at the time. Canny, eh?
Seriously...someone tell me how to stop this before I nix showering because it cuts into my goal-achieving time.

We are all, regardless of Meyers-Briggs Type, current job or past training (or lack thereof), inherently creative beings. As I’ve talked about before, our culture and particularly our schools not only don’t know how to cultivate creativity, they actively crush it by about 5th grade. This is not that rant.

I think the University needs to start taking account of it’s students living off campus as well as it’s students in halls. There simply isn’t adequate routes onto campus. The University must know that the vast majority of it’s students live either on Greenstead or in Hythe, so why not make it easier for them to get to campus?
It’s official. School is out and summer has begun. My days are longer filled with 3-hour-long lectures, dance practice, meetings, and late nights at the library. I have fully moved out of my apartment at school and although my room at home is now covered with boxes of unpacked clothes and shoes, I see that as an accomplishment. My grades from the past semester are posted (3.82, not bad) and my externship starts in exactly two weeks. So….what now?
In the winter, by contrast, yang foods should be eaten to counteract the yin temperatures. In the case of illness, yin symptom patterns (fatigue, pale complexion, weak voice) would be treated with yang foods, while yang symptoms (flushed face, loud voice, restlessness) would be treated by yin foods.

Here at Sell! Sell! we're big fans of long running advertising campaigns that manage to stay fresh over time. As we've said many a time before, it's simultaneously mind-boggling and depressing how often agencies and clients get bored with an idea long before the public ever do.

The PbC completely eliminates lead from the negative electrodes and replaces it with a highly capacitive carbon. Getting rid of the lead on the negative electrodes eliminates sulfation, rather than simply reducing it." A pretty wise old graybeard I worked with when I was still in college said, "engineering is the art of compromise", meaning you always trade various things against each other. There is rarely ever an ideal answer; just some compromises that work better than others in their intended place. Axion Power, sums up some tradeoffs this way:
But yaoi, despite it's definite propensity for graphic depictions of sex, is also about romance. And I'm a sucker for romance. True, that sometimes includes the aspects of "romance" I hate most like rape and superficiality, but good authors write consistently good manga. Shoujo generally is generally about romance, too, but there are some key differences, homosexuality being but one of them. So why am I reading it?

I’ve been taking the prescribed painkillers and taking it FAR too easy, and I’ve finally reached the point where I’m majorly bored and wishing I could get back to working out. I really feel like the last 2 months of fitness are going to be completely lost by the time I’m able to get back to anything, and that makes me really annoyed! I’m tired of lying around and not doing anything, but it still really does hurt too much to do anything MORE than walk a little.
"...this cyclone is expected to have a life of between two and three days. It is now tracking to cross Mt Isa as a category 1 cyclone sometime on Friday.

So we are still talking about a massive and intensifying event."

I spoke with Matisyahu over the phone while in Chicago and he was very patient with the brief connection issues we had to accommodate. Immediately I was at ease knowing that I’d be speaking to someone less concerned with how much time or money they don’t have. In fact, money wasn’t even brought up despite trying to get him to talk about file-sharing.

Right in the beginning of opening your mouth, you are trying to push a falsehood. You actually lie, as it has been pointed out from the very beginning of our conversations since 2006, you were never a Christian. You boastfully claim you were "for 25 years" but you never actually were.

When bottled beer drinkers turn to cask once a year and urge others to support it, you really have to sit up and take notice. Thus it was when I read Zak's blog. It seems the great and the good are getting creakily to their feet, skirting the fridge, no doubt with a longing and lingering look and wistfully surveying the exotic bottles in the garage - sorry cellar. No reaching for the outsize wine glass or the "exciting" triple Imperial Mild for them this evening; like Guy Fawkes night or Christmas Day, a once a year treat beckons. They are off to the pub to drink the real stuff.
This quilt by Elizabeth Bren was not necessarily my favourite quilt, but definitely my favourite example of quilting in the show. One of the few quilted on a domestic machine, and also one of the few where the machine quilting really complemented the piecing.

The container was then lifted by a crane, onto a ship of some kind. We heard the sound of the boats engine shuddering to life, and felt the rocking motion of the boat upon the water. I spent hours upon hours in that darkness, with heat, bodies, and the stench of urine and feces around me. Then our container was lifted up in the air again, and was deposited on solid land. Shortly after, the doors swung open.

I adapted the recipe in some ways: (a) I baked it in a muffin pan to make mini quiches, all the better to be picked up and munched on, (b) I used broccoli instead of spinach, (c) and used cheddar cheese because I am not a fan of feta.
No, Einstein, it isn’t a “game”; the word is “precaution”. Those of us not on the public dole like yourself need to actually cover our expenses, and a reloadable gift card allows prepayment from a distance. It’s also a wise precaution against criminals like yourself who have a nasty habit of robbing people under cover of “law enforcement”. And please don’t project your warped suspicions onto other people; YOU may “automatically believe cash is an ill-gotten gain”, but normal people and the government of the U.S. refer to it as “legal tender”.
I've been busy getting some work done since we got back from our small (but much needed) vacation. It seems I have developed a bad habit of making a card, putting it aside to post later, and then forgetting about it...
Firstly it attempts to place the blame for drunken behaviour on the first rather than last drink of an evening (god forbid you place it on the actual drunk) and shift it onto supermarkets and away from pubs and bars when all those fighting and puking in the street have clearly being hitting the bars near where the trouble occurred. An attempt to shift responsibility and paint pubs and bars as wholly safe, responsible and controlled environments.

I am the person who wakes up, groans internally when I see the clock, closes my eyes for 'a few more minutes' and falls right back to sleep because the bed is so warm and soft. Groans again when I next open my eyes and see how much time has actually passed, and scrambles to get ready. I spend entirely too much time sifting through clothes, hoping to find clean matching socks for the kids and pants that fit. Because, my other confession, I hate doing laundry. The clean clothes just pile up, begging me to sort, fold, and put them away. If only I would do that. It would probably help with my morning routine.
It did not matter that UCLA fans dominated the lower level of the arena; the Coyotes were not going to let that deter them from showing their pride and support for our team.
Excuse/Issue Resolution Two:
This is the type of film that sparks debate. While it can’t be called entertainment (there are plenty of other ways this story could be told) it takes courage of conviction to make a film that depicts violence in it’s ugliest form. The recent re-make of The Last House On The Left (see review elsewhere here) covers similar ground but doesn’t leave you feeling as dirty as this does. Another comparable film is the French movie Irreversible in which Monica Bellucci’s character suffers an attack of such ferocity that scores of audience members got up and walked out.

So how do you push on as a designer and a creative soul if you are constantly having to create within these limitations? How do you keep your sanity, and be proud of your work? How can you fight for your freedom? Well you can start by no longer perceiving these client imposed boundaries as limiting. Be thankful in fact, that you have them. These guides make your job easier, and NO design job should start without a well documented and mutually agreeable brief. A good design brief sets the pace, cuts free any misconceptions, saves you time and money and is a valuable reference point. It allows you to narrow your field of vision to a few concepts, concepts which can be explored in depth with all the creative juices you can muster.
drowning ruth takes place during wwi. older sister amanda has just had a nervous breakdown & left her job as a nurse to head home to rural wisconsin for a break. she goes to live with her sister mathilda & her daughter ruth (malthida's husband carl is fighting in france). less than a year after amanda's arrival, mathilda is dead- she is found under the ice in a pond on their property. when carl arrives home from france he finds ruth under amanda's tight grip. the story is told by 2 narrators- amanda & ruth. amanda alternates between past & present while ruth mostly tells about the present, but every now & then brings up the night she drowns.
But I need to think about what's next. I am teaching, now - the Women and Madness class - and really enjoyed rereading Freud's case studies this weekend - that Freud, he is SUCH A TRIP. But I don't have obviously a full slate of classes. I am writing an essay on Caitlin Flanagan for The New Inquiry - I need to start work on that this morning, more than scribbling things that make me laugh in the margins of the book - although before class tonight I have to watch and tweet Gossip Girl and play with my darling puppy, so there's that. I am hoping to write more of these essays - it's funny, I feel like that's a return, but hopefully a different sort of return. I am also at work on Under the Shadow of My Roof, kind of concurrent with the essay writing. But regardless I need to figure out an occupation. Right now I am considering: public intellectual, or, upon 6 years of graduate school, if I can ever get into a program, scholarly intellectual. Or, TV critic. Or, I don't know. It all feels so uncertain, the future. I know I will have readings to do for Heroines beginning in the fall, and I will be hopefully doing some more readings with Gina Abelkop this spring and summer. I'm going to be reading in Asheville this upcoming weekend, and two New York readings next week. Everything feels full, and sort of busy. I guess that's a good thing?

During Highpoint we have been totally consumed, mainly spending time in our showroom, talking to designers, boutique and department stores. The best experience outside the showroom was a short escape to hear Maxwell Gillingham founder of Apartment Therapy speak. OK one can build a perfectly popular and engaging site/platform but that doesn't always mean the person behind it reflects this as well. But after hearing Gillingham speak there is only one conclusion: Gillingham = Apartment Therapy (with the support of his fantastic team of course).

In Performing Prose: The Study and Practice of Style in Composition, the authors are aiming to make the abstract idea of “style” a concrete tool writers everywhere can utilize.

All Saints, to you who were not raised Catholics, originated with Pope Boniface IV, who instigated the idea in the early 7th century when he consecrated the Pantheon in Rome as a church dedicated to Saint Mary and the Martyrs, and ordered that that date, May 13, should be celebrated every year. Several centuries later, Pope Urban IV (d. 1264), ordered it to be a day specially to honour those saints who didn't have a festival day of their own.

Apparently what NASA calls “medium-sized junk” falls back to earth about once a week. Debris the size of a bus falls about once a year. When bits of the Skylab space station (the size of a house) fell onto parts of Western Australia in July 1979, local authorities fined NASA $400 for littering.
But enough with the nonsense; to start off a series of Glee related posts I selected a piece that I re-watched on TV today. It’s a mash-up between Rihanna’s “Umbrella” and “Singin’ in the rain” from the musical.

When first meeting with a client and throughout the process of creating a succession plan, it is important to properly explain the need for ongoing evaluation of these agreements. While the agent educates the business partners on the need for a buy-sell agreement or key person insurance, the agent can also convey that these are constantly evolving documents that will need to be re-examined on a yearly basis to ensure that strong protection remains in place. Having this in mind will not only prepare these owners for when the advisor calls to schedule a checkup, but also help to reinforce how important succession plan updates can be.
So think about that the next time Reina Tanaka is chewing up the scenery as a slobby, mentaiko-bread-loving high schooler. (At the tender age of 22 lololololol.) Mathjisuka Gakuen and Majisuka Gakuen are both cheesy as hell, but in the math school we see girls taking on that cheese with confidence—they’ve done it on a theater stage, and they can do it in front of a camera. I guess to a REAL actor who acts in REAL shows it’s all equal crap to them, but when Tanaka finishes that final proof with a flourish and that mischievous, self-satisfied smile of hers, you can’t help but be caught up in her charisma.

Clearly there are more people out there like me than I originally thought. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.

This is a beer for which one's mouth literally waters. But the Bitter Woman is by no means the brewery's one hit wonder. A while back I was able to secure a sampler pack of a variety of Tyranena's products, so I got a crack at each of the brews in their standard line-up. Some of these aren't my favorite styles, but believe me there's not a bad one in the bunch. For example, Three Beaches Blonde is a light ale perfect for those who aren't sold on the intense bittering of an IPA or fear the dark roast of a porter or stout. This beer has a wonderful fruity quality and a nice hint of honey on the finish.

“As a song director Yoo Youngjin wrote, it’s been a very long time since the SMP (sm performance) style appeared. There are people who think about DBSK seniors’ first debut when hearing this song, and others that it’s new. Anyway, since lately the trend for the boybands is to debut with a very cute and pretty song, I think we can get more interested in a strong song. I like the orchestra sound’s imposing feeling.”(Sehun)
I thought of the title while listening to the song “Parentheses” by The Antlers (great song, great album, great band, listen here). Even though the lyrics don’t exactly have the same meaning that I was going for in my title, they served as inspiration nonetheless. This blog will be a place to record the parentheses, the interruptions from my usual routine, the side notes, if you will, of my life. Little anecdotes or thoughts of mine that may, or may not, be worthwhile writing about.

Yesterday, voters in North Carolina voted to amend their state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. And to be fair, North Carolina isn’t the first state to pass a constitutional amendment discriminating against ordinary Americans in this way. There are at least 30 others. But we expected more from the Tar Heels. From a state that boasts pillars of higher learning and advancement like Duke and Wake Forest Universities, the University of North Carolina, and from a state that grows increasingly culturally diverse with metropolitan areas like Charlotte, we expected better from North Carolina.
I've been enjoying the front garden so much lately that I've hardly taken time to enjoy the rest of the garden this summer. Our front yard is the sunniest and warmest place to spend the day, and with the lack of sun we'd been having for most of the summer, I chose not to spend the sunny days in the shady backyard. After lots of sunny days in a row, and more predicted to come, I took some time to clean out the pond and enjoy how pretty it looks in the backyard now. There are still plants that are behind in their blooming, but I'm hoping they'll just bloom longer into August and September.

Other bloggers have shorter posts, such as Librarian’s Commute, The Distant Librarian, and David Lee King. Too short was occasionally a problem when the brevity was a result of not giving any examples to demonstrate the points being made. Also, the extremely short postings were so short that they didn’t catch my interest. The blog I am most likely to continue to read is David Lee King. His posts left me wanting a little more, but in a good way: long enough to catch my interest but short enough not to bore me. Lesson to be learned here: find that sweet spot when it comes to length.

I love children’s books and my own collection although pared down by all my moves is embarrassingly large.

In our experience biotech cases can be the most challenging during examination. However it is important to realise that at the EPO a real dialogue is possible with the Examiner. Whilst the EPO does have an established practice and case law which seems quite strict, Examiners are open to the arguments made by applicants.

It's definitely a delightfully scrappy quilt with elements of surprise. If you don't already own this publication then you really should. :-) Two of my favorite bloggy friends are STARS! :-)
Dear Commissioner Palmieri:

But when we humble ourselves before the Lord, He is always waiting with open arms to forgive and to love us. That's a wonderful thought! No strings, no restrictions, no making us pay for a wrong over and over and over, He forgives and our sin is then cast away as far as the east is from the west. But it begins with examining your own heart.

The trick in part is to understand subjective morality and whether it imprisons or frees the human soul, but also to understand that for everything there is a price. If you set the price too high it may not be met. The only way to actually ensure you get an opportunity to sell out is by setting your price low. Set your price at a free beer and you can guarantee you'll get the opportunity to sell out. Thus what we have here is not pongy old man's ale, but fine craft beer, from a fine traditional brewery making modern ales for the modern discerning palate.

This is a wonderful introduction to what wind is and how it works. It even debunks the popular idea that air weighs nothing. Readers simply need a few materials (a plastic bag, a hanger, balloons, etc.) in order to conduct the series of basic experiments within the book. Between experiments, readers are offered explanations of how wind does what it does and how we experience it. The simplicity of the language combined with the great illustrations and easy-to-do science experiments make this book a wonderful resource for teachers and parents alike.

Several GRSF volunteers doggie-sat us while our humans had lunch next door on the human side of the park. Miss Wendy, Miss Rebecca, Mom and a few others hung out, swapped stories and enjoyed the sunny day. After lunch, Mom played fetch with JJ while I enjoyed the ambiance for a little while longer. Mom brought us to the human side (as did everyone else and their K9s) and we sat in the grass while the leader of GRSF, Miss Carol, spoke to us. Then, they participated in this thing called a raffle and another thing called a silent auction. Mom didn’t win anything; she told us she should not play this thing called the lottery.

Revolting as it may sound to pronounce such words, what should matter to policy-makers is not Is it revolting, but rather Is it true. If it was true then, and still is true, then the consequences for Euro-American policy-makers are vast. Except for the brief disaster known as Reconstruction, the great experiment of putting municipal government into the hands of Afro-Americans is still young. The results thus far have ranged from worrying to calamitous. Bringing in ethnically Euro managers from the outside to save these cities from themselves may be the only answer, as unhappily this 'race in its childhood' shows time and again that its adulthood lies somewhere in the future.

I can't help but feel that Malick's searching through the miasma of time and evolution, in dopey whisper-overs, not for God, or his true Dad, or Brecht, but for an ideal art film audience, the kind that 'got' Antonioni and didn't fall asleep or turn off the tape halfway through. He wants a human mind's eye gallery for his photographs, which slowly move--ala Bill Viola--so slow down and weep along or kindly check your messages with your hand over the blue screen. Images are important to us. If the film says anything, it may be "I Am a cinematographer. But is this stuff Tarkovsky, Eisenstein? Ain't no Russians, ain't even any atomic age. I was kind of shocked the mushroom cloud wasn't even addressed, when surely the age of atomic anxiety was at least worth mentioning, or television. Can a family really get along on nothing but prayers and piano lessons? No wonder Brad Pitt's cranky! No wonder that poor son is so starved for images he has to steal female undergarments. Unlike the rest of us, he didn't grow up bombarded with TV and in-class movies and filmstrips, and comic books. That lack has made him hot for images the way a reformed Mormon is hot for the pleasures of the flesh. If you've ever made it with an ex-Mormon you know what I mean. They take to your body like someone dying of thirst to an ice cold beer. This is how Malick takes to the image, guilelessly and openly.
Dear W,
So, I escape a long time marriage of vile emotional and mental abuse that could have killed me only to have to be in hospital thanks to another loss: her support as a friend. She’ll still be your friend, he says. Oh. Isn’t that precious. Isn’t she gracious. How the hell could anyone ever trust a thing she EVER says again? She was so deceitful all those months, how could he even THINK that was possible. Childish of them both. Except she is manipulating HIM now to thinking what a good person she is because she will still be ‘my’ friend. Oh, God, spare me.

"You can never tell how things will get reported as a consequence of our interactions," President Obama said. "When we met two years ago, we exchanged beers from our hometowns. One news story said: “David Cameron and Barack Obama cemented their special relationship -- by hitting the bottle.”
This experience made us at first very scared. The shivers did ran down our spine on thinking of the whole process we had to do- the holding, banging and then dissecting the frog’s little body as it twitched itself in pain..
It seems the only export markets George Younger had left were India, the West Indies and the Straits Settlements. I was at first surprised that the West Indies market lasted so long. But, the situation there was quite different to, say, South Africa and Australia, which were large territories that were establishing their own industrial base. The West Indian colonies were much smaller and based mainly around agricultural products. It's telling that Jamaica's Desnoe and Geddes was only founded in 1918. The brewing industry was much more developed in South Africa and Australia by that time.
Recently we have learned that conservative Republican Mia Love has won the nomination for Utah's newly created 4th Congressional District. The heads of liberals from coast to coast have exploded in sheer amazement. How could racist, women hating Republicans vote for a black woman?

I was invited over His lap, a concession on His part that I was/am very thankful for...and He even started off with a quick hand warm-up. Then He started in with that darn paddle. Each set was a build-up in speed and power. I was kicking and ouching, and trying to move away, and even told Him once to stop. Not my best behavior. He would stop and talk and calm me and start again. Finally He started on a set and I just lay there, head down, panting, but staying quiet and in place. I hear Master say, finally....acceptance. When He finishes this set, He tells me to ask for another set, saying that I want it to be the hardest yet, so I remember it for a long time, and to say it loudly and as if I mean it. Master knows this is difficult for me, so He gives me a minute or two, and I ask. He agrees and starts with the hardest,

I took the kids to the pool this evening. Well, I didn't take Jackson since he can't swim until he gets his stitches out. And I didn't take Brooklyn because I told her she had to eat her dinner if she wanted to go to the pool. Instead of eating, she chose to lick a piece of bread and drink half a cup of Hershey's syrup (don't ask). But the other 4 and I headed over to the pool after dinner.

Alright, alright - she's being played by a completely different woman (Lilyan Chauvin from the original, Jean Miller here), and in the three years time from movie to movie the orphanage has been closed, she has to get around in a wheelchair, she's had a stroke of some sort and lots of scarred, nasty Phantom Of the Opera-ish makeup on her face but yeah: the same character. Myself, I wouldn't think that one person could change so much in three years. I understand that the dynamic is that there had to be enough time for the pre-teen Ricky from before to age into the late-teen Ricky we have here, but Mom Superior...wow. This is like she has some sort of bad run-in with a Salvation Army truck.
The issues go beyond simply raising a child under false pretenses. Once an adoption, even one performed under false premises, is completed, the child becomes a legal beneficiary of the adoptive parents estate, for example. Then there are the issues surrounding the true nature of the relationship between these children and their adoptive families. As Sue recounted, she could see the stress of lying on her son's face as he repeatedly covered up the truth from her probing questions. One day, he just got tired of lying.
Am I the only one that has one of those?

Specifically, Making Planning Popular "aims to encourage greater popular knowledge of how the built environment is, or could be, produced." Accordingly, "David is showing a manifesto, recent articles and essays, and a series of case studies chosen from his growing database of arcane, marginalized, or forgotten planning practices. This work will in time form a popular history of planning"—publishers, take note!—"one in which such practises are brought back to life to explore their relevance to today’s environment, in the belief that putting planning knowledge back into popular culture will lead to a more democratic built environment."

I'm so thankful that it was a quick process, because I'm not sure I could have done it if it was any longer. I am still recovering from the "quickness" of it all. There was a little bit of tearing but nothing near as traumatic as the third degree episiotomy I got last time. My unknown on call Dr ended up being fantastic, and she allowed my body to work on its own without jumping to cut anything.
Since I have never had a long-term, monogamous relationship, you can probably guess that I’ve kissed a lot of people. Like the rest of my non-existent sex life, it took me a while to feel comfortable with kissing. I didn’t receive my first one until I was sixteen. I never had the opportunity to kiss my first crush, Christopher. However, my second huge crush, Jordan, did the honors.

I have always loved reading. I'm a fast reader and a prolific one. I used to get a little disoriented by my reading speed when I would digest a mighty tome spanning several generations in an afternoon. One of the things I miss the most in my working mother life is the luxury of time to read for pleasure, and I relish my business trips. Those nice quiet plane rides are perfect places to climb into much anticipated new novels, carefully selected weeks in advance. I get inordinately disappointed if a book turns out to be rubbish, my reading time is so very precious now.
The slogan "Forward!" reflected the conviction of European Marxists and radicals that their movements reflected the march of history, which would move forward past capitalism and into socialism and communism.
I felt a sharp pain as he sank it into my neck but it lasted only for a second and a whole new feeling took over. The endorphin rush. That was what I needed. Addictive it was and way better than drugs. I felt high but it was only for a minute before the pain seeped in again. I moaned with agony and he took another sip of my blood to make it go away. The constant cycle of biting, the pain, and the effect of it all took place for the entire night. I couldn’t remember it in details the next morning but my neck felt sore.

Is it appropriate that the matter be investigated? Of course it is. Here, in the highest profile perjury case in Scotland for many a year, it is alleged that a senior journalist, with connections to the Government, may have lied on oath. The Crown Office would have been criticised if it had failed to look at these concerns, though since the allegations re the NotW phone hacking have been about for a long time, it might be asked what evidence in particular has prompted the Crown Office decision today, rather than before. Perhaps the front pages of the newspapers qualifies as the necessary “evidence” to prompt the inquiry, bearing in Mind Mr Sheridan’s solicitor, Mr Anwar, stated some time ago that his phone had been hacked by, he suspected, the NotW.
Now had I an evidence, as I thought, of my salvation from heaven, with many golden seals thereon, all hanging in my sight; now could I remember this manifestation and the other discovery of grace, with comfort; and should often long and desire that the last day were come, that I might for ever be inflamed with the sight, and joy, and communion with Him whose head was crowned with thorns, whose face was spit on, and body broken, and soul made an offering for my sins: for whereas, before, I lay continually trembling at the mouth of hell, now methought I was got so far therefrom that I could not, when I looked back, scarce discern it; and oh! thought I, that I were fourscore years old now, that I might die quickly, that my soul might be gone to rest.
I don't mind someone else being busy, late, or forgetting. I simply don't.

Where, when, can I still make it? Yesterday, you say... of last week? Right. Birthdays? Forgettaboutit. Anniversaries with lady-friends? Huh? Holidays? What do you mean it's Christmas day already?

Yesterday at around 5 pm, F3 ventured yet again into one of the traps. She was caught several weeks ago, but released because the field crew thought she might be lactating and didn’t want to keep her from her kits at what would have been a crucial time. Her behavior since that incident raised suspicions that she wasn’t, in fact, denning, and when she went into the trap yesterday, we headed to Montana, arriving at two in the morning and getting up at six to go the trap. The risk to any hypothetical kits would have been reduced by the fact that they would now be old enough to be left for a greater length of time.

I have this weird compulsion, though, to find out more about the people who died young. I’ll Google them, read the comments on their obituary on Legacy.com, look them up on Facebook, look their friends up on Facebook. It’s always sad when someone dies young, but when I do this, I’m always hoping to find out how the person died, and hoping that it’s any way but the saddest way to die.

I give NEVER credit for fully taking on the idea that James Bond is getting old. They don’t pretend that Connery can still do everything now that he could do two decades earlier and the film is built on this idea that Bond has outlived his youth. He’s called on the carpet for his lifestyle, he’s forced to start taking better care of himself, he’s spent the majority of his time teaching instead of being in the field, and the world is ready to move on without him. The problem is that whatever they thought in 1983, in 2011 we kinda see the point of the bookish M’s complaint. There is value in working out and eating right and if Bond really hasn’t do any of that over the years, then he should darn well start sooner rather than later.

Then, use a spoon to scoop out small balls and roll in your hands (it is a bit messy) and then roll through cocoa powder until coated. Top with a sprinkle of matcha powder.

On the corner of Sutphin Boulevard and 91st Avenue in Queens is King Fish. From outside, it is hard to imagine that this establishment, with its small store front and simple sign, is one of the most popular in the borough. Traffic through here is always constant which can easily be due to New York's dense population but which just as easily can be attributed to the impressive selection of seafood here. Red snapper, grouper heads, scungilli, king fish. An excellent variety to say the least; a selection that caters to the city's diverse communities - those grouper heads are a favorite among Trinidadians for fish soup.
And as being told, here are the rules:

Miller’s title is an apt one. His critics called Socrates the gadfly of Athens: “No matter how hard his opponents tried to swat him away, he kept biting them with difficult questions.” Iris is the horsefly in this story. She asks the hard questions, the queries everyone else wants to sweep under a rug.
In case anyone was wondering, yes, I will be at New York Comic Con this weekend. Mostly hanging out at the Top Shelf table, signing copies of the not-really-a-'new-release-anymore-but-still-worth-your-time Liar's Kiss and just generally being personable. Stop by, say hi!
Of course focusing on the kids is a pleasure. It’s nice to feel like I’m actually doing something good. For years I’ve been dumping my son one place or another while I jump into the rat race for the day and then pick him up for scraps of time each evening. It was necessary at the time but life changes and I’ve changed. I don’t think I could have been happy then without work in my life, and now working was interrupting my life.

Isn’t that like giving a book to a man who cannot read? I’m not advocating that we should veer away from Christians in Christian fiction. I’m saying that there is a purpose and a place for books with Christian characters and also characters who are not Christians–the non-believers, the doubters, the people in spiritual crisis who need help but who are so lost they don’t even know what they need. There is purpose in those books, and let’s be honest, those who might benefit from them aren’t apt to be ones cruising through the inspirational section in a bookstore.
They walked to the parking lot towards her car, away from the horde of fans waiting for him at the tour bus. She said “You shouldn’t leave your fans disappointed”. “Not to worry” he said. “Most of them are happy enough with Pretty Boy Billy”. As they drove towards her house, she glanced over at him. ”Well I would imagine you have all kinds of girlfriends everywhere”, trying to sound nonchalant about the images playing in her head. He stared at her a moment. “Well”, he said, “Let me be perfectly honest”. “So before this goes too far, let me tell you what you are. You’re amazing, I’m attracted, but I’m terribly distracted. And I’m trying to be verbal, and I’m back into this circle because I just found someone special. And that’s really something special if you knew me. Nice to meet you, nice to meet you, nice to meet you anyway. And even if you want me to stay here, I’m telling you right now I should leave before I get to changing my mind, dear. I hope you understand what I mean.”

Tuesday, Tiffany and Michelle went to the National Archives. I slept in and vegged. My hips were hurting so bad by this point from all of the walking. I then met them at the National Portrait Gallery where we saw an exhibit of Norman Rockwell's work from the collections of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Very cool!
Its such a great comfort to know, that our little apartment is situated on some faulty tectonic plate connected to a shifting one in Indo and India, those places have something happen to them yearly - and now we are in the firing line!

Nevertheless, I didn’t take communion until after I was baptized at 13. Some friends of my parents, who had started a little restorationist house church of their own, took it a step further. If you weren’t baptized, you couldn’t even partake in worship with the rest of the group. They were a lovely, sweet old couple, but how this was supported by scripture is beyond me. Nothing makes God less attractive to a preteen than being told he wants you out of the group.

The first red that I will show you today is one by Sleek MakeUp. I've had this polish since December and I've used it as underwear for my China Glaze Ring in the Red mani that I posted about here. When I first bought it I expected it to be more blue-toned, but I was disappointed to see it's not. It actually pulls very orange on me.

Some books and films for children sacrifice emotional depth for plot. That’s fair enough if all that happens is a pressing of the mute button. Not every series needs to be full of wrenching psychological angst. Anthony Horowitz’s brilliant Alex Rider series for example is all action, but when you do hear about Alex’s inner life you believe every word.

Bridget: “Because -”
On Friday he told me I was 3.5-4 cm dilated and asked if I wanted him to strip my membranes. Because that only works if the baby and I are ready, I decided I was fine with that. He did it 2 or 3 times with Evelyn and nothing ever happened. I planned on seeing him back for my OB check the following Monday. Immediately I started having the lovely pinkish discharge. I had some cramping, but it was minimal- like early menstrual cramps. Saturday morning, I started to realize that my minimal cramping was coming at regular intervals. I never had any contractions with Evelyn until after the Pitocin, so I didn’t know what I was supposed to be expecting. Steve and I both remembered that I was told with Evelyn that contractions make your stomach hard- like your forehead. But these were just felt down low, below my big belly, and in my back, like a minor backache. No hard belly-tightening.
What an awkward pose! We went up to the mall to cool off and see Kung Fu Panda 2 in 3D. I can't watch 3D movies with out getting a headache so I was no fun the rest of the time in the mall. I did go down to Sears and try on several pieces of Land's End clothing. I was so excited that they fit and they were not in the plus size. I still have a long way to go but it felt good to try on and look around at all I will be wearing soon. It has kept me motivated! T shirt-JC Penney
Happy Birthday, sweet Sarah. We’re so lucky to be yours.
This will definitely change things for him and me. Our identities, I think, are going to be the most in jeopardy. CJ and I have become a "we" and an "us" but we can't forget who each other are deep down. We mustn't change who we truly are in this whole process. I've often felt that I've lost myself a lil in this relationship but even just acknowledging that helps me bring it all back to focus. There has to be a happy medium of understanding, compromise, and listening to each other's needs and above all else, sharing. Of course there's been other 2 only children couples that have lived together but this might be a challenge for us sometimes. However I'm up for the challenge. This is going to be an awesome test run for the rest of our lives...I'm strangely comfortable with that.

I’m getting emails from people asking me if I know Angelique Todd, the English girl who’s hanging out with a tribe of gorillas in the Central African Republic. Obviously not. Her base camp is 300 miles away, and I’m not going to travel all that distance to say hello to a woman with a face like Squirrel Nutkin. She'd be most welcome to visit us, of course, and we'd extend her every courtesy short of milking the suckling hippo. English women may love their dairy products, but we gorillas don’t grope animals that outweigh us by half a ton.
When I tried to see the puruSa in myself (abhyAsa : seeing puruSa in others), I was shocked and pained to see a dark tar-like hardness that was all the self-denial and self-sacrifice and injustice-to-self that I have indulged in, in the course of my life. I wrote a public apology to myself (I’m sorry!) and then when I looked inwards I saw a light white mist and not that horrible black tar. When I look at others I see the light brightness of the puruSa!

Amazing how when you're busy, time just flies by! I'm in my 4th month of pregnancy already, it's just flying by. The kids are all doing well with school. Jackson's reading has been a struggle for him, but we're seeing definite improvement, and a friend and fellow homeschooler shared some tips with me on helping him. She has a son his age and another Jacob's age who both also do and did struggle with reading, so I'm very prayerful that over the next few months we'll have a full fledge reader on our hands. Emma's doing very well with her letters and loves doing school work. We're going slow and steady. Jacob's doing great, although we're working on him rushing through everything, when he takes his time he never misses a thing!
The rest of the basement really still looks the same. Now the junk is organized into boxes of similar junk. Kitchen crap in three boxes, decor crap in four boxes, etc. See? Pictures do not look very different.

Morning everyone. Oooh I'm a little sleep deprived so I apologise in advance for any bad spelling or grammar! This is a scheduled post as I'm on a 12hr day shift today after only finishing my night shifts yesterday morning! My body clocks shot to pieces lol. The kids are at my mums and Pete's away so I've got the house to myself. Sounds good but I'm sure it'll feel a little eerie when I get in from work later tonight!

When I left her office, I thought, go get something with an eagle on it. I went to a store that sold Southwestern, Native stuff, thinking I might find something there. I had never been inside this store before, and had never heard of Zuni fetishes, but I went in and there was this beautiful stone eagle on a shelf of animal carvings, staring at me with a turquoise eye. I bought it, and the clerk gave me a bunch of information about the significance of the eagle in various cultures:
A common question posed by aspiring writers is: How do I get published? Every published author has a story, but the plot to Meg Gardiner's "big break" story is as twisted and surprising as any you might read in a mystery novel.

The root itself has little aroma, but when the root is grated or cut, that grate or cut damages the cells in the root causing the release of an oil in the plant that causes an irritation to the nose, eyes and the mouth. This is what we would also call the heat in the vegetable. Consider a hot mustard…same thing.
Perhaps to stand up to the grandeur of steakhouse fare you need to have a big wine, which unfortunately will carry a big price tag.
In the world of today speaking the truth is a revolutionary act. Not just speaking the truth about politics but about Jesus as well. Even in most churches now days the truth is very taboo. Tradition is held as an act of worship, even when the tradition is wrong and goes against the teachings of the bible. Speaking the truth and standing for God means being persecuted, hated, and abused even by church people clinging to the wicked traditions of man. I have lost many people I believed were friends for my stance for the truth. I have made people angry enough to try to fight me. They find out that I will not fight back, so they do not physically hurt me, they just harass me.
There is something magical about the beach in winter, particularly at a very low tide. The rocks, which are normally hidden underwater are exposed to the elements, and the view stretches for miles, uninterrupted by swimmers or boats. It is incredibly peaceful, even with a skipping five year old!
When Gary, Mary, and Walter get to the Muppet Studios, they find it in complete disrepair. Admission only costs 50 cents, but even that seems a steep price given the decrepit condition. Walter sneaks into Kermit’s workshop and accidentally discovers that Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), his two Muppet henchmen (Bobo the Bear and Uncle Deadly), and Statler and Waldorf are conspiring to destroy the studios completely in order to dig for oil that lies beneath the property. If the Muppets want to keep the studios and the rights to their name, they’ve got to raise $10 million. The visitors from Smalltown head to Kermit’s house to let the depressed frog know what’s what, and convince him to reunite the gang in order to put on a show to come up with the cash.

If you find yourself barely being able to drag yourself out of the bed every morning, pray, ask God to give you strength. Especially if you wake early to exercise. The first thing that comes into your head is, “why did I wake up so early?” I can sleep a little longer. Take these opportunities and early mornings to build your mind and body. Devote time to reading the Bible or daily devotionals. Open yourself up to Him. Create opportunities to fill your heart. Even if we may be blindly committed, Jesus Christ is the ultimate guide.

I really don't think I'm a chump. I actually think I have selective memory disorder and the little girl who asks how high to jump when asked tends to revert back to the known. I also think that I can't change my integral self. I like to help and will give you the shirt off off of my back if you have a need. It's been ingrained in me and most times it's one of my better attributes. Except for those times that I offer the assistance, the caring to the wrong people.
Section 3 of Commonwealth Act No. 671 provides for the filing of a report with Congress by the President as soon as that body convened. According to the majority opinion on that date the whole Act No. 671 ceased to have force and effect. Under that theory, as soon as the Congress convened in June, 1945, and it is to be presumed that President Osmeña, complying with his duty, must have made his report of all the numerous Executive Orders he had issued so far, perhaps including those issued by his predecessor President Quezon who because of his premature death was unable to report his acts to Congress, the President automatically lost his emergency powers. But the majority opinion qualifies this convening of the Congress, for it says that it must be a regular session and not a special session, thereby extending the life of Commonwealth act No. 671 one year longer, to May, 1946 when Congress held its first regular session after liberation. I do not quite see the necessity or the reason for the distinction made between the special and regular session, for at both sessions Congress could well receive the report of the President. The reason given is that “in a special session Congress may consider general legislation or only such subjects as he (President) may designate.” But as a matter of fact, the first two special sessions called by President Osmeña in 1945, after liberation, each for a period of thirty days were both to consider general legislation. So, actually there is no reason for the distinction.
Well, it was room in which men could talk "freely", as women were barred. Not possible nowadays, of course, with all our equal opportunity legislation.

To this extent, one of the most lacking of Awards in my estimation is that of the work of Parliamentarians – whether in Britain, US, India.

So I am sifting through boxes and drawers and find a linoleum block/woodcutting kit bought about ten years prior. Thought I would give it a go. I found that I truly enjoyed carving the blocks with my various Art Deco inspired images, retro fashion plates and an Art Nouveau inspired nature scene as well. And I enjoyed the printing itself. A new found medium.
I did a "theme" for my present. My theme was "Girls Night In" I had a bottle of one of my favorite Wines (Cameron Hughes 273) a copy of one of my favorite movies... 27 dresses ($4 on sale!) and a bag of 100 calorie microwave popcorn). Mine cost a little more than $10, but that is okay, because it is my party, I can do what I want ;)
You see while you sit around and eat all that gastrointestinal horrible food it curls into a ball where you let it release into the air that I breathe. I don't know how many of you know how bad a beer fart is but increase this a bit. It is like rotten eggs, that sulfuric smell of torture. Friday's are the worst because everyone around you is farting and trying to look nonchalant. Well I am hear to tell you that it is not discreet and it hurts my health I am sure from breathing in your butt stench. I hope that you all take heed of this blog, should you go out and eat like it's a hangover Sunday, make sure you use the toilet before coming into the bar. Please do not put myself and everyone else through your torture. Sincerely-Everyone

MH: You mentioned Ari Marmell's Household Gods as your first entry into YA, but I read Finlay's The Prodigal Troll, which Pyr published a few years back and that definitely had a YA feel to it as well so this doesn't feel that far afield. I know some publishers end up putting YA books in the normal adult SFF section like Tor did with Zoe's Tale rather than YA. Do you know what kind of strategy you'll be taking with it? Was there anything in particular that drew you to this Household Gods?

Hundred Waters create a sound that is truly their own here. It's part pop, part folk, part experimental, and is largely electronic. They clearly know what they're doing when they mix electronics into the otherwise organic songs and it never comes off as amateurish. The singer has a very soft voice that's easy to get drawn into. The album definitely fits into modern indie music well, and is one of the more accomplished albums I've heard in a long time. - Matthew Foster

A really nice roasted malt and burnt rubber aroma. (I sometimes find burnt rubber in my stouts, and people say it sounds really unappetising.. but that's how it smells, and I'm not trying to put it across as a bad thing.) The flavour is rich and creamy. Big on the burnt malt roasted bitterness but light in the finish, which is really good as it doesn't feel like it's filling you up - a problem I'm finding recently drinking pints of stout.

I’d like to think that people have it in them to always be their best…but I know not to be so naïve as to think every corporation will act in a responsible manner. And if you take away the personhood that makes each corporation obliged to follow the law you make every corporation a mafia, a law unto itself who acts under omerta like silence so that no individual within the corporation can be prosecuted. You think a corporation can behave badly now? Wait until you remove their personhood.

However, it’s usually only once a book has been published and has picked up some momentum--good sales, excellent reviews, media interest--that it becomes a viable candidate for foreign sales. Your agent, therefore, will concentrate on selling your book for first-time publication before he starts thinking about foreign and/or other subrights--and since he’ll be doing that in his own country, your book needs to be a good fit for that market. Books with American characters in American settings usually aren't suitable for first sale in the UK, just as books with British characters in British settings usually aren't suitable for first sale in the US. It's tough enough for any book to find a readership; it's even tougher when the subject matter may not resonate with with the prospective audience. That's certainly how publishers see it.

Leave it to Jessica Simpson to need an instruction manual for naming a baby.

You can ask anonymously if you want. There have been a few questions already asked in the comments section from the last post but if you have more - go ahead and ask! Don't be shy. I will be answering them sometime soon with the help of a few friends. We'll be nice, don't worry. We'll do our best to answer them if not accurately, at least comically. You really can't lose.
There was a place for comments afterwards and there were more than 200 comments. Many of them were of a forgiving nature...Britney became famous too young, it's the stress, it's her stage-mom etc.... Some were mean of course, (it's scary to know that people who say these things walk the earth!) But many of them appeared to be like me, they read the article because Bipolar Disorder was mentioned and they either had it, or had a family member with it.
And what American hotels may lack in excessive pillowing, they tend to make up for with a wonderful piece of bedding called the “duvet.” For those of you not familiar with the finer things in life, a duvet is a quilt stuffed inside a blanket stuffed inside a sheet. The name alone, with its suggestions of French luxury not seen since the court of Louis XIV, is enough to send my muscles into a state of total relaxation. When I die, I want my body to be wrapped in a duvet. What you do with it after that doesn’t concern me. Throw it in an overgrown lot zoned for light industrial use for all I care.

Publishing is the Wild West right now, with changes happening daily and most of the prognosticators from the beginning of the year already proven wrong, as they were last year and the year before. The recent settlement with the Justice Department by several of the Big 6 is a huge game changer.

So, I began doing an exercise from a writing book where you start interviewing your character. It's suppose to help you get to know them a little better. So, I start off interviewing him for his hopes and dreams and he tells me that he wants to go back to fort Laramie and leave his wife either here or with Hazel Henderson back in Cheyenne. I was floored.

Seb, still a little nerdy but excelling at wrestling. His mother would have had a conniption had she seen the bruises on his arms and the grazes on his knees, sustained from being dragged across the canvas. She'd be even more horrified to see his opponent's split lips and eyebrows but at least this pursuit had him being noticed by the fraternity chiefs. Caning David Wiltshire clinched the deal, and he was asked to pledge. His Fraternity brother's recognising his potential value to the team, despite his social ineptitude. After seeing Corina's acceptance to swallow her pride in order to belong, he too shook the hand that would inaugurate him and began his three weeks of humiliation before the final Hell Week pledge

Day 019 – August 10, 2011
Before you go to bed or when you wake up in the morning, when is it you decide what it is you will be wearing for the day or event that you need to get dressed for? Do you choose an ensemble based on how you will spend your day, or with whom? Do you choose on the fly or are you a planner?

The message to boys: Eh, you could take this from the Peter Pan Pedophile view or the brother’s view, either way, if you take the girl you have to take the brothers as well, either to keep people off your trail or to protect your sister, who isn’t smart enough to go alone and she takes care of you, like a mother, anyway.
I have summarized the essence of what I have taken from the day 1 of this training event. All these need to be put to practice.
The stress of living with the addicted abuser is terrible, I narrowly escaped my own alcohol addiction, self-medicating in order to live with a big time abuser addicted to alcohol and power. I grew up in a broken home, so far below the poverty line as to not even see it. I grew up without a father, and believed I did not have the right to deprive my children of theirs. I lasted 8 years and it almost destroyed me. I drove myself (type A) in the career arena in order to provide the financial security that I had never had. Fast track to early burn-out.
Beer can evaporate rather quickly depending on how much heat you use. I think it cooks off quicker than wine. But then again it depends on the cooking temperature. If you are cooking a brisket slow and low it doesn’t burn off nearly as fast as if you’re boiling up a mess of bratwurst.

Today’s decision in the Copyright Tribunal is part of an on-going series of cases where Meltwater and the PRCA challenged the NLA on its high fees for reading freely available news. In the ruling, the Copyright Tribunal agreed with Meltwater and the PRCA's contention that the NLA's proposed licensing scheme was not reasonable and required amendment. Nine points were challenged by Meltwater and the Tribunal agreed with Meltwater on seven of them. By fighting this licensing scheme, the PRCA and Meltwater were successful in reducing the fees for all businesses totalling more than £100 million over the next three years. The savings for Meltwater clients alone are more than £24 million in the same period.

It is 1848. Revolutions rumble through much of Europe. Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Prague and Rome are shaken by demonstrations of students and workers, demanding democracy and reforms. English philosopher John Stuart Mill shakes up economic theory. Karl Marx writes about the exploitation of the laboring masses. In the United States, it’s a presidential election year and Daniel Webster and Henry Clay find once again that the executive office has eluded them both. A determined group of women are gathering in Seneca Falls, New York. The Oneida Community begins a radical experiment in group living. The Associated Press is organized. Telegraph service extends from New York to Chicago. Gold is discovered in California at Sutter’s Mill. Over a quarter of a million (226,527) immigrants enter the United States, of whom 49.8% come from economically ravaged Ireland; And in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a new weekly newspaper appears. It’s revolutionary because its editor is a woman.

One thing I love about social media is that you can see what’s “trending” at the current moment, whether it be halfway across the world or right within your own town. It’s quite entertaining. Someone starts something, it turns into a huge craze, everyone joins in, and next thing you know, there are 500 different stories on your news feed featuring the infamous plankers or “what people think I do” memes. But somehow, I’m always the last to know. Perhaps it’s because I have more important things to do like “free reading” or watching squirrels fight in my backyard. I don’t know.
Amounts that can be contributed to qualified retirement plans are governed by certain limitations. These limits, determined by the IRS and influenced by cost of living indices, can change every year. For 2012, there are small increases to the 2011 limits.

There are many variables impacting eating behaviors that we need to consider in the fight for healthier eating habits. Prescriptive supply-side solutions won’t fix the obesity crisis. Shaming the food industry or overweight people won’t do it either. The answer lies on the demand side of the equation. And that’s the hard part of the equation. If the demand is there, the supply will follow. The overweight and obesity issue in this country requires comprehensive, societal change, one that impacts body, mind, soul and environment. It’s pretty daunting to think about it that way, but then again, so is the problem.
UKTI also works in partnership with other organisations to deliver internationalisation initiatives. For example, the Export Marketing Research Scheme is an initiative run by the British Chambers of Commerce as a contractor to UKTI. It provides advice and co-funding (at up to £5k per project) for eligible companies to carry out their own market research overseas. The Chambers can also provide support for an Export Communications Review, which examines a company’s strategic communications approach to trading overseas.

I'm also trying to get back into stamping... as most of you know, it was a rough year for me, but things are looking up and I'm starting new. I actually cleaned off my stamp table and stamped a little last week. Baby steps... LOL.

Growing up in the ’80s was great, as I recall: the 49ers and Joe Montana were dominant; my pop music cassette collection ruled; and I was not at all embarrassed by the thought of wearing Jams shorts. (Admit it — you owned more than a pair or two yourself). I remembered the phone numbers of my parents and friends easily, too, and the only place I answered a phone was inside my house. Ah, memories.

Then her memory moved up to eighth grade. Sam Knepp. A thirteen-year-old girl just had to have someone to like. The other girls would have thought her a true dummkopf if she had no one. And so she had picked Sam at random. What other choice had there been? Sam sat across the aisle from her. He was sort of cute. He had freckles, red hair, and a good smile. But there was that horrible habit he had of opening his mouth when he was puzzled or surprised.
It is slightly irritating at times not to be able to give people a clear answer when they ask me whether I am introverted or extroverted. I think that for me, just like for most everyone else, it depends on the day.

I do the same thing with house work. I plan out in my head what MUST get done today, and be sure I do that while little man is eating or enthralled in one of our special "closet toys". Then I can do other smaller chores through out the day, but I'm not upset if I don't get everything done, because my main goal was to get the one large chore done.

With shoes, I employ a variety of approaches. First of all, I try to buy shoes that don’t suck. They need to be wide enough for my feet, which not many shoes made for women actually are. They need to have plenty of ankle support, and they need to also have arch support. I’m a walker; I walk long distances in urban terrain, and I kick the crap out of my shoes. By the time they’re broken in, I have to replace them, because they are also worn out. I usually have to Band-Aid at least one part of at least one foot, for at least a week or two when the blisters reach their zenith, so that I may continue walking and breaking in said shoes. It’s quite the feat, but I do know that eventually they will conform – because they have to – and there will be peace. (Hint: for those of you who experience pain in their arches when breaking in new shoes – try loosening the laces. Works like a charm.)
My cherished plans may go astray,
Then we did the stupid thing. Everyone I've spoken to about this, including architects, has said I should have just done it. We were going to replace the shed with a brand new one - and had emailed the authority to tell them we were doing it, under the rule of an existing building can be replaced like-for-like.
While searching for a label for Songs From The Heart, I happened upon an e-mail address of Bryan Thomas, who had written a review of us several years ago in All Music Guide. I sent him the new CD and he immediately got back to me to recommend Steve Stanley of Now Sounds. It turns out that Steve had been trying to get the license from The Universal Music Group for our original album for sometime and was unsuccessful. I told him to try again now that we were getting renewed interest on the internet. Three days later, bingo, he got permission. This is surely serendipity.
Deviate a fraction of a moral millimeter from the prevailing orthodoxy and you are either not listened to or you are jeered at and abused, your reading of history trashed, your humanity itself called into question. I don’t say that self-pityingly. As always with dictatorships of the mind, the worst harmed are not the ones not listened to, but the ones not listening.

On Stranger Tides is nothing but a cheap rip-off of a book fused with Disney characters and Blackbeard. By the end you feel like you’ve sat through twice the length of the previous films and are left flabbergasted at how awful it was. Hopefully this puts a long needed rest to the Pirates franchise as it clearly needs it. For a script that was worked on and redone and refined so much, or so the claim is, the mediocre script and acting is not enough to carry something that was so special in its debut in 2003. There are far better fan fictions that would have made a better film. Even me and my friend worked on a far more superior story than what was barfed out for Stranger Tides.

I've heard of spiders from Mississauga, but spiders from Budapest?!? Absolutely ridiculous! Sporting not one, but two facial anomalies, a bearded man with glasses, halfway through The Spider Labyrinth (a.k.a. Il nido del ragno), a movie about... (I'll get back to you on that, as I haven't decided yet), utters the line: "I'm in the middle of a situation I do not understand." Mere moments after these words were spoken, I couldn't help but notice that I was nodding profusely. At first, I thought there was something wrong with my neck–it's been known to cease up on me, especially when I'm watching weirdo Italian horror flicks set in Magyarország, a magical land located smack-dab in the middle of Europe (come for the paprika, stay for the screeching harpies). But then it dawned on me: I was concurring with his bewildered statement, and, as everyone knows, when I agree with something I hear, I tend to express that agreement by nodding (the level of the nod's profuseness depends on the quality of the item being agreed upon). It's not that the film, directed by Gianfranco Giagni, is overly complex (it's pretty straightforward, if you think about it), it's just that it leaves out a few key details. However, it's recently come to my attention that I should stop expecting films to lay out their plots in an easy to digest manner, and, of course, quit boasting about my ability to lower and raise my head.
I go back to Kirsten's place with her, and pack my bags....because I just...felt like moving. It's nice to have wiggle room in your road trip plans. I was feeling---more like a small town, and like.... exploding my car's contents all over the place so I could regroup.
By the end of the book I felt like this was more about setting up where the series will go from here since its taking them to a different place and with a whole new group of people.
With my first years, we were working with film scripts and acting them out which led to some hilarious moments. Often times, they had no idea what film they were acting out (the character names were changed, and since they've most likely only seen the film dubbed into French, the dialogue doesn't sound familiar.) It's been a little while since I've shared some little classroom anecdotes, so here we go.

This, perhaps more than any of the other Tedder’s Top Ten lists, is a pretty inadequate list. There are some folks who travel throughout the Methodist blogging world far more than I and who, therefore, are far more competent to make this list than I.

I first learned about “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” when I stumbled across it playing as part of Pop-Up Video on VH1 several years ago. It was “The Time Warp” scene and I remember thinking hey, that’s the song from Fiesta Texas! Based on the stage play “The Rocky Horror Show”, the movie was released in 1975 and starred much of the original stage production’s cast. Although not initially a hit, the movie went on to play well at midnight screenings around the country, and 37 years later it holds the record for the longest running theatrical release of all time because it has never been pulled from cinemas. Although I’ve caught bits and pieces of the movie over the years on late night television I had never sat and watched it in its entirety until recently when I attended a midnight screening at the Alamo Drafthouse Village in Austin, TX.

Following her studies at the prestigious Cours Florent, Emmanuelle Devos began shooting with the brilliant young generation of filmmakers fresh out of La Fémis: Noémie Lvovsky and Arnaud Desplechin who brought her to Cannes in 1996 with his My Sex Life… or How I Got Into an Argument. The accolades arrived in 2001 with Jacques Audiard’s Read My Lips (César for Best Actress). She filmed again with Desplechin and Audiard and also with Nicole Garcia, Emmanuel Carrère, Alain Resnais and Xavier Giannoli, whose In The Beginning saw her win the 2010 César for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Still devoted to theatre work, her film career continues unabated. She will soon begin shooting with Martin Provost and with Jérôme Bonnell alongside Gabriel Byrne.

Sometimes Mother Nature really irks me. This is one of those times. We finally tasted the beauty of the spring of 2011 only to be pulled straight into an unending succession of rainy, damp days. Then came heat and humidity the likes of August in the Midwest. Now we’re back to the cool, crisp days that we have come to expect during a New England spring. We may have survived The Rapture, but I’m not sure that I will survive another week of Mother Nature’s roulette wheel of spring weather.

She also told us that the wine bottles, some of them dating back to as early as the 1400s, have never been touched.

Fairness compels me to make a few observations. First, one does not visit Bermuda for the beer selection. Beer geeks might instead focus on the gorgeous scenery and great snorkeling – two areas where Bermuda arguably trumps, say, a Brussels or a London. Second, there is at least one brewery on the island, more than can be said for many places around the world, though I can't speak to the quality of their wares as I did not have a chance to visit. Also, let's not forget that in a climate like Bermuda's, often your lighter lagers are just what the doctor ordered, and indeed one could do worse (one could also do better, but one could do worse) than Heinie, Stella, Sam Adams, and so on.

My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you and I hope that I have that desire in all that I am doing. And I know that if I do this, you will lead me by the right road although I may know nothing about it. Therefore will I trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death, I will not fear, for you are ever with me and you will never leave me to face my perils alone.

FAQ: This is going to be the bulk of the new updated blog, which is sort of a shorthand version of everything I want to include in the book. I've got lots of half-finished draft posts and lists of questions I'm working on. They'll just be posted to the blog as normal and listed on the Pages somewhere. It seems like the simplest way to do it.
Apparently, they shred the boat covers to get inside. They’re looking for food or warmth or warm food.

My goal? I’m going to become a detective, like Sam Spade, and then I’ll find out what happened to Mum when she didn’t come back from the supermarket two years ago. I will, and I’ll bring her home.

Don't go to buy, unless you have an unlimited budget. Go for inspiration, but definitely eat at Ze Cafe around the corner, on East 52nd. The food is sublime, the intimate carriage house space lovely, and we were charmed by the still demure, Gloria Vanderbilt, lunching in a straw hat, elegant white sheath, with bright red sandals to match her signature red lips. Anderson Cooper inherited her inscrutable eyes.
However, I found this book very original, funny and entertaining. I read it in just few hours and really liked Lawrence. He might seem a bit bitter at times (at least that's my opinion), but you can feel he DOES care about love and women. I sometimes thought he cares even too much, trying to decode everything a woman does, or tells him, each message or e-mail he gets.
The Fun Ford Weekend Series presented by Roush Yates, JE Pistons and Joe Gibbs Driven is proud to announce that the renowned RK Motors Charlotte has joined the series as a 2012 sponsor.
Eli's been a little off lately. He's not loving much of his music....and not laughing much. This makes us sad. We feel his laughter lets us know all is right in his world.
Lovely organic asparagus topped with a dollop of chicken with veloute' sauce. Then a Raclette Crepe was created with sliced boiled potatoes, the Prosciutto Ham and that fantastic cheese which melts to perfection.
Salut Benjy! So what do you wear to stay snug on the chilly parisian streets? I hear you like cashmere, I'd love to see some of your outfits! merci! Marie
I often wish my mom were here so we could go back and talk about these things. I wish I could visit that horrible fashion-show scene with her now that I'm a grown woman and could have words for her there. I wish we could talk about why appearance was so important and where she wounded me in that. I wish we could cry together and talk and work through the hard things that made our mother-daughter relationship so tense and strained.
1. send my daddy to the states for a very intense medical treatment, just like in the teleseryes and the movies where the rich families send the rich dads to The States for the super serious medical condition consultation. We’ll fly first class because we wouldn’t want the masikip flights of the budget airlines. The mention of Budget Airlines will make us shudder by the time we’re swimming in cashes.
All those things change always is.
Special thanks to Dec for sending this my way much apreciated mate

And finally (in cases of hysteria) both the object, the feelings for it, and resulting guilt (caused by the super-ego’s criticism) are repressed—causing hysteric reactions.
Do you have any special plans for dinner this year? Lunch? Take out? Dine in? Fancy restaurant? Your favorite hole in the wall? Meal with the whole family? How do you celebrate? I'd sure love to hear...
It all started with My Name is Aram. It was a hot summer day - the last of the library books sat on my desk, my best friend was on vacation and it was a Thursday ... in August. I was bored. School would not start again for another 4 long weeks ... two more days until my next trip to the library.
What is it about a full jigger of absinthe that so intrigued Charles Baker? While tastes have changed since the late 1930s, especially those regarding sweetness, Mr. Baker's fascination with all things involving heaping amounts of absinthe befuddles me. As someone who used recently learned to enjoy all things licorice-flavored, I can completely appreciate the beauty that hints of anise bring to so many classic cocktails, such as the Morning Glory, the Sazerac, or any Improved Cocktail. I can even understand the joys of a Suissesse, Absinthe cocktail, Absinthe frappe, or any other cocktail that is wholly centered on the unique flavor profile of absinthe. But what I can't grasp is why anyone would make a cocktail with all these other substantial ingredients and then add so much absinthe to it that nothing else could be tasted. If you want an absinthe-based drink, have an absinthe drip.
All documents sufficient to show affirmative proof of residency, citizenship and other information asserting the true residence of Julian H. Robertson including, but not limited to, documents reflecting Julian Robertson's birth certificate, home address, place of employment, bank accounts, ownership of real property and social security number, as well as certified photocopies of driver's license(s) and all pages of last issued passport(s), voter registration card, tax returns from any and all countries wherein he pays taxes, including applicable employment forms and documents authenticating plaintiff's residence.
That means I now have 37 little 'bits' to write, some just a couple sentences of what E. calls 'counter-history' for a neighborhood spot and others more complex in terms of needing to establish something about a relationship or a plot development or even serve as an entire new scene (only a couple of these I hope). About to go out and tromp round the neighborhood for a few final physical details; will probably be writing these 'bits' over the next three days.
So again my heart does softly beat,

These photos, taken by LIFE photographer J. R. Eyerman, show the 22-year-old starlet in her early-career days, when she was still a newbie in Hollywood and her locks weren't yet that platinum blonde she later would become known for. Eyerman captured these photos in the fall of 1948, following Marilyn through the showbiz training-- acting, singing, dancing-- that would one day make her an icon.
Joey remembers being separated from his mother at an auction ("I screamed for my mother and heard her reply echoing in the far distance") to a mean, alcoholic old "owner" who lumps him in with an older horse named Zoey. The owner's 13-year old son, Albert Narracott, takes a liking to Joey despite his mother's insistence that he leave him alone.

Though her steps feel lackluster, this plain, goody-two-shoes Cinderella does seems to grow bit by bit during her journey — as if by proxy — when she dances with another. While she herself has to forever symbolize humble virtue, the prince demonstrates her dancing joy when he partners with her; at this point, her godmother’s superior womanly strength and power seem to fill the young girl, too.
A lot has been written about a black man being elected to the white house since November 4th. All I know is that I met a woman who has possibly never been as hopeful about her country as she was when a man with the same complexion was elected to the white house. And this gives me hope.

When we fail to ask God’s powerful questions we cannot lean on His unlimited strength. I know that I need His strength to help me cope with the challenges of everyday. When someone says, “no” I’ve learned to ask, “why?” When someone says, “yes” I’ve learned to ask, “how?” Too often when we seek information, what we receive is noise rather than real answers.
I was about to post on this subject when David beat me to it. However, I was not planning such a comprehensive post as the one David has provided for us. I just wanted to consider one section – the testimony of Jesus at his trial.
No! It was ridiculous. You can’t just have part of your face not moving and the rest moving everywhere. That doesn’t work.

Oreos and pretzels were coated in chocolate and sprinkles. We made trays of peppermint bark, chocolate toffee and chocolate covered peanuts. We also made the cutest candy canes with chocolate Santas, which I think will be delicious with a cup of hot chocolate.
Indigenous leaders dismiss Bush’s views that more research is needed, and point out climate change is already happening. Yefimenko, from the Russian Far East, asserts one can no longer take snowmobiles across frozen lakes and be sure of reaching the other side without sliding in the water. Around the Arctic, water flows in rivers are unpredictable and it’s very difficult for reindeer herders to cross those rivers.
Again what is meant by theft or to be thief. Apart from the Criminal Definition societal values shape what constitutes theft. Does theft means only tangible commodities. Does theft include intangible commodities like feelings sentiments emotions. There are great many heroines/heroes who stole the hearts of many men/women and can we call it theft. The very feelings of all these men/women towards a heroine/hero other than their own girl friends or wives constitute mental prostitution. Are thieves are only those who steals caught prosecuted and put in jail ? Those who have a behavior tendency kleptomania steals but never caught of even if they are caught can they be defined as thieves ? If a sister takes some thing with out informing her parents or brother can that be considered a theft ? For example if Nira Radia and likes stole crores worth of 2 G spectrum and sold to foreign companies. Was it considered theft ? Scores of corporate administrative executives like Sri Lakshmi (women) got corrupted stole public money in bribes and benefited few corporate executives or political leaders. Was that considered theft ?

There are people much smarter than me who have tried to quantify quality of life - the Tripawds folks posted a link to an article in the comments section of the previous post that's probably worth looking into though I haven't read it yet.
The Thunder are one of the NBA’s trendiest teams and it is becoming time for them to shed the youth factor as an excuse for not winning. The Thunder made it all the way to the Western Conference Finals last season only to lose to the eventual NBA champions. This season they are returning all their major pieces including Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. This will be the team’s first season with Kendrick Perkins manning the center spot for a full year and there is no reason not to expect them back toward the top of the Western Conference.
it was fun observing the adoration that they have for each other. logan has a smile to die for. little sis has an equally fantastic smile and a sass about her that i love.

The overlapping of the mala and the bracelet broadcasts the generosity of spirit that time distanced from experience can provide. A reminder that enlightenment is often about untying the more complex and intricate legacies. Her gift of this bracelet is the mantra I need to hold.
I am so excited about this giveaway from Graca who blogs over at Sew Essentially Sew. Up for grabs is this amazing vintage vogue dress and coat pattern (for sizes 8-14). This giveaway is open to everyone and Graca will ship anywhere! You can enter the giveaway (which is open until Friday) here... I've been lucky to win a couple of giveaways from Graca myself! If you haven't check out her blog--definitely do so! I just love it! As she puts it...
What I inmediately noticed is that the Revlon Lip Butters have different finishes, some of them are frosty, shimmery, and cream and I love the color selection, there are a couple of nudes, very bold colors and darker colors as well. The L'Oreal Balm all have cream a cream finish and they all are more wearable colors. As for the smell, Revlon Lip Butter, even tough they all have food names they don't really smell at all. Balm has as slight vanilla scent very yummy I must say.
Also, I've also posted a ton of past beer trip photos at Potable Curmudgeon Inc., my travel/consultancy Facebook page. Check them out at your leisure. Verily, there have been many good times.

4. The Mouth That Roared
Last Thursday afternoon we hit the road for Hallowell where we planned to show the Lubec Arts Alive film at the Harlow Gallery. We made it to town with only minutes to spare before the event and luckily all went off without a hitch. Nancy, who oversees programming at the gallery, had already set-up the seating and projector. I don't think I will ever get tired of seeing the film and it always gets me a bit teary-eyed at the end.

Ok...so I've been thinking about this for quite some time.
The curtains eventually arrived, and they looked great, and we managed to sleep a bit longer, although by that time we were used to getting up early and still woke up early. S has a theory he has spent too many years in my cave like environment and has adapted to my needs of dark rooms to sleep in :)
But neither authors nor publishers have that romantic aura. If you believe an author is by definition rich, and probably gets about £5 of the £6.99 you pay for her latest paperback, then you will feel less guilty about illegally downloading that book instead. The author can take the loss because she’s an author, and they’re rich, aren’t they, all these newspaper articles prove it. The reductio ad absurdam is that eventually nobody will earn money from writing content while every other lifestyle page has a “Grandad gets 10-book deal after showing top agent his shopping list” story – pasted from a press release because the publication can’t afford journalists any more.
You may have noticed our newsletter's just a couple days late this month. That's because there are a lot of changes going on right now behind-the-scenes. Just hang tight! You'll get your shiny all-in-one-place email SOON. We promise!
2011 was a crazy year. We got married in July (it only took us nine years…) and I’ve just brought out my first crime novel* which was exciting. Eventually, though, after six months we were very fortunate to sell our house in Essex. But because we couldn’t find anywhere to purchase we had to rent.
Maybe I just feel bad for Death, because everyone is scared of the Death card, but all it really represents is an ending, and a beginning. Things have to end before new things can begin, and for some reason we seem to forget that in order to start over, you have to end. You have to die, if we are taking the analogy all the way. We need Death.
The show is actually the first program that BBC America has developed and funded internally, rather than re-broadcasted from the UK. In a nutshell, I would describe the show as a combination between Iron Chef/Chopped and Survivor.

It's been a little bit since I had a trade post to, uh, post, but fortunately Johnny of the new hotness that is Cards from the Quarry (warning: more purple than a day of basketball and pancakes at Prince's house) came through with some nice stuff today. As I once did with some of you, he read my blog and hit me up about trading while also introducing me to his blog, which I'm now following (and you should too, whether or not you're a Rockies fan). I'm always down for that, so trade we did. I sent some Colorado stuff his way, and here's what I got back:
The White House was noticeably silent on the law’s two-year anniversary.
For almost every single argument one can think of there will always be a counter argument or some kind of exception to the rule. That’s why the word “debate” exists. So unless you are interested in debating just for the fun of it, or unless you are able to prove your opponent wrong and highlight weaknesses and flaws in his argument there is really no need to waste your time. Examine the following statement, for instance:

My life is an open book. Nothing to hide… nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about.
The cast is outstanding with faultless acting. Carey Mulligan is radiant as Jenny and Alfred Molina plays her limited father, easily persuaded by the glib Peter Sarsgaard as David, and Olivia Williams as the despairing teacher. Dominic Cooper is excellent as David's friend, one of those slimy types who live by their wits and always choose malleable, attractive women. Rosamund Pike as his girlfriend is outstanding especially when Helen is puzzled by the common term “to read English” while the great Billy Fury's Maybe Tomorrow plays in the background.

So for any of those out there with some '68's to trade, drop me an email. My wantlist is on the right hand side. I have a number of vintage stars from the 60's and 70's, some pretty nice, others a little beat up. Heck, if you have an off-condition Mantle, I'll trade you an off-conditioned 1963 or 1966 Topps Koufax. If you have a nice Bird Belters (#530), I have a 1961 Topps Frank Robinson with your name on it. Whatever you have, drop me a line and I'll be sure to respond.
I seldom buy full CD’s anymore..I mainly buy MP3 downloads from Amazon, eMusic, and (very seldom) iTunes. Most of the time, I do not buy whole albums of MP3′s. I just select the ones that I like after listening to the streaming album on Rhapsody. It saves me money in the long run, and I can avoid skipping song after song while driving!

We haven't been spanking lately, and I have been worrying that since we haven't been actively practicing Dd, that we would just fall apart and go back to the bad habits that we forced upon each other before. After the episode, I went back to being respectful and submissive... and he started talking to me as if nothing ever happened. Communication is so important... but sometimes communication doesn't have to involve words. Sometimes less is more. Sometimes just body language... eye contact... attitude... all speaks louder than words.
That's it. He can't lift it any more and if he wants to drink it, he has to tilt his head down or use his other hand. I keep teasing him and telling him that I didn't sign up for life with a cripple. Mom told me to remember the "for better or for worse" part of the nuptials. I said, yeah, but we never promised to LIKE it. God I hope it gets better but it has only improved slightly in 9 days time. Fingers crossed for poor Sergie.
Conservatives’ buttons are pushed by other things. If conservatives see someone disrespecting a person in authority, betraying loyalty to some sort of a group, or doing something disgusting, sexually disgusting, they go off.

In Article 3(b) of the Unified Patent Court Agreement concerning the jurisdiction of the court over European patents, there is a reference to “supplementary protection certificate issued for a patent”. Article 2(7) of the Agreement indicates that “patent” means a European patent and a European patent with unitary effect.
“I know it’s still tough. I know the battle’s not yet over. Some of your buddies are going to get injured and some of your buddies may get killed and there’s going to be heartbreak and pain and difficulty ahead,” he said. “But there’s a light on the horizon because of the sacrifices you’ve made.”
When I handed Mama the last gift, she surprised us by reaching into the pockets of her robe and presenting each of us with a small wrapped box as well. I remember looking at Phillip in shock: how on earth—and when—had she located and wrapped presents for us? She was never left alone in our home, could no longer drive, and certainly didn’t walk into town on her own. She didn’t have the strength for any of these things.
There are still five months and change until my debut novel comes out. I have a teleconference scheduled next week with the publicity team at my publisher to discuss…well, I’m not really sure what all is going to be discussed. But I’m greatly looking forward to it and will keep everyone updated on what happens. In other words: things are happening (and will continue to happen) as the date of release approaches. Between now and then I’m going to have to continue focusing on my health but plan to also continue writing/editing and working towards the release in September.
If the sixties was a naive and charming flower child, then the seventies was her big, bad older brother; darker, more worldly, less giving … and the eighties was his garishly-painted and promiscuous girlfriend. It’s no wonder against such a backdrop that things could become confused — and that dreams could turn to heartbreak.
At this point I wash my hands in very warm water unlike if I were making pastry, or scones, where you need quite cold hands, as very warm hands assist the yeast, and you tend to get a nicer dough.
Dirk Bogarde was a cinema star of international magnitude in the 1960’s and 70’s, his films being screened across Europe and North America. In the 50’s however, his star shone mostly in Britain (albeit shown very brightly) and he was cast in a variety of roles including the comedic “Doctor” series. But some of his best roles from this period and precursors of those parts which made him a mega star, were those which cast him in a dark shadow. How’s THAT for a segue way?

Since I previously promised some posts focused on the importance of corrective exercise as well as the ultimate chapter of the Fat Loss series (check out the previous installments here and here), I felt it would make sense to begin this discussion with the importance of soft tissue work.
John would go up there and ice skate, and Dan would too. But one day John asked to go up there, and I said sure.
The Bible says that God is our dad. That’s a weird thought at first considering who God is. He is more than anything we could ever imagine. He is the perfect representation of love. He is the creator of everything we see and everything we can’t see. It’s almost unfathomable to consider Him as a dad, but that’s exactly how the Bible describes Him.

We had our ultrasound yesterday afternoon. The wonton kicked like a mad fiend the whole time, but it went well overall. You can see from the photo above that s/he’s still in there. We saw (and heard) the heart beat steadily, we saw all kinds of baby parts (though not the kind that would give away the sex, sorry Al), and we learned about the size.
