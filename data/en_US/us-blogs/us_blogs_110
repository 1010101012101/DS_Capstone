Notwithstanding the academic’s dubious method — did he really need to watch all that TV to come to that answer? — his finding is consistent with what most of us consider common sense. But make no mistake, the celebration of narcissism isn’t exclusive to the tube. In fact, TV is but one vehicle in a parking lot full of vacuous media hype machines forever reminding you of your incontrovertible magnificence.
As for Shakil, it is difficult to say. I liked him, even admired him for having a core of steel draped in velvet, but I could not quite get excited about his personality. He just seemed too ‘perfect’ for me. However, once again I suspect the author has introduced him as much for a future reason as his role in this novel. We will see.

I don't really have a usual. Usually try and hang out with some friends outdoors grilling/BBQ'ing. I typically manage to bring an awesome dessert along, like last years 100% from scratch red/white/blue vanilla cake with strawberry filling and homemade frostings (both buttercream and fondant):
Christmas is definitely my favorite time of the year. I love warm sweaters, early mornings with coffee and just the lights of the tree and traditions.
Earlier in the month, United were eight points clear atop the Premier League standings. I offered up my thoughts and opinions on United’s run for the title, which I thought were fairly accurate and on-point. Alas, the Reds seemed to perform in the opposite manner, dropping an all-important game versus a soon-to-be relegated Wigan team, as well as blowing a massive lead at home against Everton. These dropped points proved costly, and all signs pointed towards the Etihad Stadium for the derby.

We may sympathize with the need for laws to be clear and the rights of individuals to be protected. But there comes a point where one has to say that given a choice between wisdom and law, one would prefer more of the former and less of the latter.

The terms used by economists are misleading. State control is Socialisation, not Nationalisation; Stock Market corporate control is Internationalisation, not Privatisation. The legal prohibition of foreign ownership, and the break up of larger corporations to ensure the maximum practicable level of private individual control, goes by the awkward label of Distributism - although Nationalisation would be more appropriate. It is perhaps to distract the people from the real workable alternative to Internationalisation and Socialisation, that the economic labels are muddled. By deception our enemies do war.

One of the most widely recognized celebrity disasters this year was the Kim Kardashian, Kris Humphries wedding. After only being married for days, the marriage was ended. Newspapers and magazines went crazy writing about this event, as the wedding had been all anyone had been talking about! The dream wedding was aired on television, and audiences were consumed by it. When the divorce was announced, the public relations representatives for Kim did not do a good job of covering her story. The news was posted everywhere, but nowhere did they give a reason behind the divorce. Kim is now recognized as materialistic and it is expected that the wedding, as well as the divorce, are just a big publicity stunt. If there had been more reasoning and insight from Kim herself, she may have a better reputation as a result.

So, is there another ‘social networking’ site out there that actually concentrates on social networking, or are we stuck living in a time when all you do is pass around pictures? Frankly, if I could find another site that was kind of like Facebook and kind of like Google+, but didn’t have games and concentrated more on what people were doing I’d sign up in a heartbeat.

In the text of the act, the law is allowed to be used against anyone who knowingly enters or remains in a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority to do so, but those grounds are considered any area where someone — rather it’s President Obama, Senator Santorum or Governor Romney — will be temporarily visiting, whether or not the public is even made aware. Entering such a facility is thus outlawed, as is disrupting the orderly conduct of “official functions,” engaging in disorderly conduct “within such proximity to” the event or acting violent to anyone, anywhere near the premises. Under that verbiage, that means a peaceful protest outside a candidate’s concession speech would be a federal offense, but those occurrences covered as special event of national significance don’t just stop there, either. And neither does the list of covered persons that receive protection.

He bought Bootjack Ranch, a 224 acre property on Highway 46 East in Paso Robles and two years later 139 acre Heart Hill Vineyard, which gets its name from a natural oak-tree filled depression on the hillside near the road in the perfect shape of a heart.

I think it may be a bit odd to make your kid's undies, especially when you can buy them so cheaply, but that is exactly what I have done this week. And it's not the first time either!

As we so often counsel our students (right after the Power Point slide on Culture Shock): You will return home a changed person. I joke and say Charleston will not change, which always gets a laugh as if to say “Duh, Kelly.” I point out that the traveler is the one who embodies the change. Their parents, siblings, partners have remained the same – but the student has experienced a shift. We use the time worn phrases to coach them: broaden your perspective, open your mind, change your life. So with our blessing, they go forth and conquer .. and then what?

Nineteen year-old Alice’s pre-Underland life (or more accurately, her time in between trips to the fantasy land) sees her mother attempting to marry her off to Lord Ascot’s son, who’s rich, but a loser, and is just trying to trap Alice further into high society life. Alice’s mom isn’t an evil witch or anything (Ascot’s wife fills this role nicely), but that’s the point; it’s not just the mean that trap you, it’s the weak and meek who simply strap themselves in and ride the ride. There’s a huge scene at the Ascot estate that’s all boring dancing and society-demanded behavior. There’s a huge level of phoniness to it all, of course, as evidenced by Alice’s brother-in-law making out with someone who’s not his wife, but the overriding existence of this whole party sequence is to show us how trapped Alice is by society’s expectations.

So, the busy month. What could have possibly kept me away? Lets go through this chronologically, peeps, for the sake of thoroughness.
When I was younger I sort of lived in the ghetto, haha. It's a bit exaggerated, but it's kind of true. The houses weren't fancy, the neighbourhood wasn't that decent. At night you heard squealing tires of cars getting away quickly. People were hanging in groups often. Music everywhere. But we had a hard time, back in the days. A single not working mother and two children, no wonder we were living in the "ghetto". But this time has taught me so many things.
Yet as if to make sure that no-one mistakes Scalped for a work that's nothing but despairing, if not even entirely nihilistic, Aaron also introduces to us to citizens who are doing the very best they can to create a world in which the community might hold together if not exactly prosper. There are the teachers encouraging their students to aspire to jobs such as "marine biologist", and there are the policemen such as Officer Falls Down who deliberately stands up in public to Red Crow and his all-too-obvious corruption. Small victories and passing kindnesses they might be, but it's implied that they're essential to the everyday well-being of the community. Yet despite these momentary sparks of hope and even defiance, we're also constantly being shown how terribly wounded the society of the Reservation is, and in that, Scalped stands as a rare example of a contemporary comic book which is explicitly designed to refute the argument that the Republic's social ills are largely the fault of a mass of utterly selfish, anti-social individuals. This isn't poverty as the cumulative effect of the selfishness and idleness of a mass of scroungers and criminals, but poverty as an inescapably objective fact of life imposed and perpetuated by a political system which is, it seems, largely beyond the people's influencing.

So it’s not that the world has caught up; we’ve fallen behind our own pace – and producing medalists in spite of ourselves! People are excited about twenty five medals when in reality we wake up on any given morning secure in the knowledge that without doing anything we will get on average at least one medal in each sprint and hurdle event and each of the relays at any given Major. That’s 14 medals nearly guaranteed without doing anything other than having an open tryout – our Trials! And even there we are behind our once world leading pace. Granted the winds in Daegu were a bit limiting, but consider that our men won medals with times of 10.08, 19.70 and 44.63. With the exception of the 200 mark, we’ve done better in nearly every Major since the 1960’s – and Tommie Smith approached that 200 mark (19.83) way back in 1968. We felt fortunate to take high jump and long jump gold, yet in ’91 both Powell AND Lewis were over 29 feet, and in ’96 Austin was making attempts near 8 feet. And while we are struggling to get a man into contention in the 800 and marvel at David Rudisha, Johnny Gray had four seasons under 1:43.00 in the 80’s/90’s; and he, Mark Everett, and Rich Kenah all medaled at various Majors in the 90’s!

Of course, this whole ALA crusade is a good example of groups that need to change their mission as time moves on, and becoming an adjunct of the left is usually the easiest way. The ALA was founded more than a century ago to fight tuberculosis. When I was a kid growing up, the ALA was mostly about convincing us to quit cigarette smoking. Now that that mission is nearly accomplished, they have to move on to something else. Trouble is, air pollution is going to prove a fading issue, too, because in another two or three decades there isn’t going to be much left here in the U.S.
For the dough: Whisk the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk and 2 tbsp of the melted butter together. Stir the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed (the dough will look very shaggy), about 30 seconds. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead until just smooth and no longer shaggy, about 30 seconds. (Make sure you don’t overwork the dough or it will become tough. Use extra flour if needed to work the dough.)
Dear Homeless Man,
It was a beautiful rainy day, I call it an "Indian Summer." Not your typical day for a wedding in Hawaii but legend says rain is a blessing and good luck... Personally I really enjoyed photographing it. We got lots of rainbows due to rain, at times very challenging to shoot but Richard and Michelle had a great energy and lots of friends and family to share it with. They did not mind getting wet and for the most part I was the one having to hide from the rain so my lenses would stay dry.
Back in the day when those Indie bands still made those small 12" EP records Echo and the Bunnymen released Lips Like Sugar as a single along with their awesome cover of that Doors song "People are Strange" that was on the Soundtrack to the Lost Boys. Oh those Late 80's college days gone by.....
These were some brilliant men we were meeting. PhD's here and PhD's there. Professors, engineers, ecologists. Good golly, these boys were barely 30 years old. They lived all over the world and had reunited in Doolin to share a little fun with their buddy.

I think things turned around for me on page 19, where Ace's not-yet-best friend Lilly is described as being "as coordinated as a newborn giraffe" on the basketball court...because really, that's my life. I played tournament basketball for most of my life, and my coach used to say that I could trip over the lines on the floor. In college, my nickname really was "giraffe", taken after that newborn giraffe clumsiness. And really, when someone so perfectly captures your life in novel form, how can you not continue to read, if not only to try and discern whether the author was secretly spying on you and crafted a novel about your life?!

“They’re the sociology, anthropology, philosophy, arts, and victim-studies students, whose degrees are increasingly worthless in a world that increasingly demands hard skills.” This statement is flawed, only because the writer is looking at north american statistics, in a north american context. Canada is the last refuge in North America for research, literature, democracy, human rights (movements and literature), clean energy, sustainable policies, etc. You need an open mind to continue Canada’s good work, and an open mind needs an open and broad education, not just the ‘hard skills’ the writer is trying to imply. To state that Canada is going to become the US by default is to ignore the complexity of Canadian culture. I heartily denounce this article because honestly – I admire these Quebecois students’ resilience and mobilization/organisation even if I disagree with their cause.
Anyway, back to the movie. DG and Cane Man make their way down the road (they almost run out of gas of course) so they stop at some random guy’s house. Now first off, if a crazy killer is after you, you should never bring someone else into that mess. And this guy is dealing with his elderly mom who just died. He’s, obviously, a computer nerd and able to place an email to 911 (?) which also, obviously, is how people contact the police these days. They all hop in the car and go to the police station, where the killer (who must be able to read emails in his chrome skull) is there waiting for them after killing all the cops with his knifey powers. So if this guy attacks you, don’t try to shoot him, just push him down. Anyways, Dumb Girl convinces them to go back to the funeral home. Cane Man locks them in the chapel part of this place and goes off to wait for his brother to come to his house (why would he do this?). So DG decides waiting around won’t help them so she leaves. Nerdy Guy sits in the car they parked next to a hearse which contains his dead mother. Chrome Skull is waiting in the hearse and takes the time to use Nerdy’s dead mom as a puppet to scare him (as if a serial killer wouldn’t scare you enough this guy has to defile a dude’s dead mom).

Even in these difficult economic times the USA is a wealthy country. People could make a living scrounging our land fills, finding useful stuff from what we throw away. We spend more money on our military than the rest of the world combined. Apple Computer has more money than the United States Government. It doesn't take much imagination to find a story there. Until the tsunami hit Japan and destroyed their nuclear plants dumping radiation into the sea, Toyota was the largest auto manufacturer in the world. We are talking about hundreds of Billions of dollars. The bailout of the auto industry, a government program beginning with a Republican Administration and completed by the Democratic Administration, worked well, probably saved a million jobs and certainly saved a lifestyle, saved American Industry and put American Auto makers back in the number one position. I wonder what Toyota would do to get it back?
It was my third year in university, after being on academic warning for having a GPA not high enough, and just looking around, and seeing the people around me that gave me some perspective. I told myself, it was time to change ( I don’t actually remember doing this ) but something came over me, where I knew I could do better for myself, in every aspect of my life.

And it doesn't fall prey to the clutter of every day life. This is my retreat - where I hide when I need quiet, reflection time. This year it is host to my favorite Christmas crafty moment thus far - this simple boxwood centerpiece.
Unfortunately, architect Louis Page decided that the new cornerstone, which bore the usual inscription (the date of construction, names of City Council members, and names of the architects and general contractors), was unacceptable and wouldn’t be used. One of the problems was the stone was made of red granite that had a great deal of black mottling, making the lettering hard to read.

Perhaps the ‘Cruddas Affair’ is a wake up call to Catholics. Why is the Church so sycophantically snuggling up to the Left? Why do we tolerate errors on this scale? Why are Catholic public figures not brought to task for the scandal they cause? Justice and peace must be at the heart of the Church’s faith and morals, and I mean true justice and peace, and not simply those ‘easy’ or ‘soft’ issues which the wider society will not object too much to, and which does not require individual Catholics to convert to the Gospel.

Over night, the tide turned and I received much more support when I spoke against it again the next day. Yay for logic and reason. Out of respect for that mother I declined to pursue the scorched earth strategy that a few compatriots put forth, an endless series of amendments about every genetic disease we could find with increasingly harrowing personal stories about each accompanied by vituperative declamations against any who disagreed.

OK. So you have your water bath pan, filled with your little custard dishes. Get yourself a nice, easy, primal custard recipe. You can experiment with it after you're used to the process. I like the Son of Grok banana "Caveman Custard" recipe. In my head, I call it "1-2-3 custard" because it requires one can of coconut milk, two bananas, and three eggs (along with a dash of cinnamon). Whip up your custard batter, and pour it into your ramekins. (I did nearly-full baby food jars, and about 1/2 inch deep in the larger dishes.)
I have an upcoming sponsorship on Kindle Nation Daily, one of the most popular book-finding sites around, for SECTOR C. It will be featured with a cover image and book description copy right before the website shows what the Kindle Daily Deal is for that day. The sponsorship ad -- which I signed up for in early October -- will run on Dec 28, which I think will be an excellent day, giving folk with new Kindles time to charge their readers up and find sites featuring bargain books.

In a large bowl combine the sugar, shortening and egg, thoroughly mix using a rubber spatula. Add in the milk and stir until the sugar has dissolved. In a second bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Using your fingers crumble into this flour mixture the brown sugar. Blend the dry ingredients into the flour ingredients. Add the pecans, stir well. Spread the batter into the cake pan. Top with the apple slices, slightly pressing them into the batter. Sprinkle with the cinnamon/sugar mixture. Bank 25-35 minutes. The coffee cake is done baking when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Serve warm with a bit of butter on top. (How I wished I had made some whipped cream to top this off)
This is what she sleeps in next to our bed. Love the incline, love the rocking, love the small size. If it had automatic rocking, I'd make love to it. Once cleared by the doctor, of course. I folded up a thin blanket and slipped it between the frame and the padding to give it a tiny bit more padding (not enough to make it unsafe I hope) and I also place a rolled-up washcloth under her neck to prevent her chin from slumping into her chest (this is why newborns/infants aren't supposed to sleep in car seats and why pouch slings are dangerous - the chin-to-chest position can cut off their airway). This was a great investment and I know most people who also have it also swear by it.
Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Scoop out about 1/4 cup of the mixture and use it to coat the pecans. Then add it all back together.

Real pirates are not and never were romantic, and neither were highwaymen, in spite of the myth of the handsome beribboned rascal who kisses the lady's hand before demanding her diamonds. There's room in fiction, I guess, for romantic rascals: but that's because it's fiction. With another hat on, I spoke recently at the Mervyn Peake Centenary Conference at the University of Chichester on Peake's classic picture book about pirates: 'Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor'. Here is Captain Slaughterboard in all his sleazy glory: a comically terrifying character in the tradition of Long John Silver and Captain Hook. Pirates in children's fiction are almost pure fantasy: as mythical as unicorns.

I had no idea, five years ago, that blogging would have taken me to the places it has. I have met a bunch of wonderful, intelligent, insightful, glorious people with whom I feel a real connection. I couldn't believe it when I got one follower who wasn't just a supportive friend. At this stage I have 119 lovely followers which to me is amazing. It's not much compared to some folks but I love it. Every single time I get a new follower, I do a little happy jig. Every time I get a comment notification in my inbox I grin like a maniac. Because it all comes down to the very basic desire I had when I first started this blog: I want people to read what I write. I want to entertain people. If someone comments or follows me, it feels like confirmation that I'm doing something right. And don't even get me started about how I feel if I am reading someone's blog and I notice I am in their blog roll. Then we're talking a victory lap of the entire apartment.
When asked about the fan turnout for the alumni skate, Lindros began to answer, but paused ever so briefly and looked up, deep in thought. In just a split second, the memories of the prime of his career – centering the famous “Legion of Doom” with LeClair and Mikael Renberg, the line that combined for 305 goals and 666 points in just over two seasons together – appeared in his mind like a movie reel. “I’m not surprised,” he finally muttered, a grin forming at the corners of his lips, perhaps thinking of the great times he shared with millions of Flyers fans for almost a decade – including a Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP, a Stanley Cup final appearance, and enough highlight reel plays to fill a YouTube account. “Flyers fans are so supportive of their team.”

There was this episode of How I Met Your Mother on (how amazingggg is that show, anyway!?), where he made a cameo, and after fangirling with my equally Enrique-lovin' sis over him every sec he was on the screen, I couldn't believe I'd forgotten all about him for a while. All right, so it wasn't that hard to believe, but you get my flow.
The Undergroundpewster's report of a 31% drop in baptisms of children in the Episcopal church posed that question which made an old Pete Seeger song come to mind. Once again, I had to change a few of the words.

Why are layoffs always the first response to distress? Pepsi has an abundance of products; maybe they have just spread themselves out to thin with their acquisitions and focus on the Frito-Lay snack division. Plus, this focus on “better-for-you” products at the expense of good ole’ Pepsi advertising and head-to-head competition with Coke will not keep Pepsi in the top of mind with consumers.
My dad recently gave me a box of old photographs, clippings, playbills, drawings, cards, college applications, stories, and other odds and ends from me that he had saved over the years. Here's a picture of me at 8 or 9 that I've never seen before.
A Mammoth in the Fridge by Michael Escoffier and illustrated by Matthieu Maudet is a deceptively simple story with a surprise ending. At first I didn’t think there was anything special about the story, until I got to the last few pages. The ending left me with a smile on my face and children will love it too. Both the text and the illustrations are quite sparse and simple but they’re fun and there’s a sense of anticipation throughout the story to keep children guessing what might happen next (will the firemen catch the mammoth? Where will he run to?). I especially like the illustration of the mammoth squashed into the fridge. The father is telling the children to stay away because it might bite, but the mammoth just looks upset that his hiding place has been discovered. Thanks Gecko Press for another unique, curiously good picture book!

But enough of that. Let’s make better use of our time together and chat about something more interesting. Because it has been an interesting few weeks. Where to begin?
BP may control the data from the patches on the shrimp boater’s sleeves and it may control its own data — which could still be pried loose with either an administrative or criminal subpoena, and probably should be — but nothing prevents the government from doing its own sampling. The notion that the federal agencies responsible for environmental, health and safety are somehow helpless bystanders is just nuts, or bullpucky. In fact, EPA, like NASA has already begun its own efforts.
This is a bad snap, but this is how the kitchen looked after we moved in over 16 years ago.
Overall I think this movie was not bad with the 3D effect, one of my friend mention that TGV IMAX is much more better with 3D movie. If Beauty and the Beast is available at TGV IMAX, you guys better go and watch it and taste the awesome effect from this movie. Rating? 7+/10, I watch this on my childhood, couldn't understand any single word, just staring at the TV and watch the cartoon jumping here and there, now I understand what is the meaning they singing in this movie, so I think this would be very fun.
ARRRRRRRRRGH! However it’s probably just as well as lunch consisted of this:

I also went to visit my Dad in hospital. I hate hospitals. It was hard sometimes as Dad was at times confused and when we took him for a walk out of the hospital it wasn’t until we were heading back that we realised he’d put his slippers on and not his shoes. So there he was walking in the rain in his slippers.

The AT&T Center in San Antonio was a fairly standard stadium venue; but, lord, how long has it been since I attended a "stadium concert?" I think, maybe U2 back in the early 90's? I went with an old boyfriend to see James Brown at the Erwin Center, but it was really a fairly small show...not sure if that counts. Anyway, it was big, but the crowd last night was only about 11,000. That seemed strange...I think Houston sold out in like minutes.

We have also been harvesting at a pretty regular rate. Frankly, I’m quite surprised at just how much food we’re bringing home; especially since this is our first year doing this. Each time we visit the garden, we can typically count on a handful of beans and a couple cucumbers being ready to pick. I have been keeping track of it just to the right of this post. (Note: The “Harvested so Far…” section is updated in real time, where these posts are edited for several days before posting. In other words, the list to the right is always a few days ahead of these posts.) In fact, both the peas and lettuce have been completely harvested at this point. We now have 6 pepper plants (including one super-chili) growing where the peas used to be.

There is no let-up in crime and violence against women in our society. The line has to be drawn somewhere. I consider women to be one of the finest and noblest creations of God filling this filthy world with plenty of charm and colour.

However, I have never been so stressed out in my entire life. We have been on the go since we first got possession of the house and we haven’t stopped. This is in no way an exaggeration. If we weren’t at our 9-5’s we were either at our house painting until 11pm or we were out buying things for our house. And to top it all off it was Christmas, so we were also doing our Christmas shopping when time allowed us. And after all that, I was determined to not let our activity level fall off the chart, so we went to bootcamp twice a week and ran at least once (which to me wasn’t enough, and thus added to my already high stress level).

Pours an unfiltered orange-amber, with a weak head but I like the unfiltered and cloudy appearance otherwise. Solid amber smell that's bready and has a twang that may come from the hops. As it warms it gets a bit of a bitter smell that may come from adjuncts. Reminds me of rice.
Re: “A time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. … A time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out – those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.” It’s unclear whether this refers to judgment at the end of the world, or whether it ties back in with Jesus opening heaven, (i.e. the three days while he was dead when he opens the gates of heaven for the first time, and goes down to hell/wherever to pick up the good souls down there who get to enter heaven now that it’s open.) The phrase that “the time has ‘now’ come” seems to imply the latter, but it could be either (or both).

I certainly don’t believe in that as much as I used to, hell, I’m not sure I believe in it at all. There are too many bad people getting away with too much horrible crap and too many good people are given way too much stuff to handle that they don’t deserve. Think about it for a minute, I bet you can think of a few, truly good and kind people who don’t deserve what they have and a few unkind, bad and selfish people you wish had more of the same, negative karma that they give out, if only to teach them a lesson or two. Does it happen often? No, it rarely happens if at all.

Elizabeth Taylor lived in Penn, in Buckinghamshire, which is where I lived for several months when I was four and my family was between countries (Liberia and Haiti). I went to my first school there, and I expect I learned to read in Penn, though I have no specific memories of learning. This coincidence has endeared Taylor to me, and I feel a tiny bit proprietorial on the basis of having shared a village with her for a few months, unbeknownst to both of us at the time.

There was no reason for the Court to make new law in this case. The defendant could have tried to invoke the “one free bite” rule. But, at best, the “one free bite” rule would only help him escape civil liability for money damages as to the first child. He was certainly on notice of the dog’s propensity when the second child was attacked. Additionally, the “one free bite” rule would not impede a dangerous dog proceeding, and a well-crafted dangerous dog statute can provide restitution to victims without the hassle of a civil law suit.
Some days I wonder if I really want to cut. Especially days when I get to go on a nice relaxing trail ride or even days I get to do ranch stuff. And even on days like today. I don't really want to ride today cause I have a toothache and my mouth is sore. But I know I can't compete if I don't have a horse that is in shape or we just risk injury. So we ride pretty much everyday. And its boring. We don't have much to practice cause we are just keeping them in shape. Walk, trot, walk, lope, walk, trot, walk. Pretty boring. But necessary. Especially with Jessie all I have to do is make sure she stops when I sit and its all good. Charlene does a little more with Dude cause he gets lazy in his rollback so she practices them and the circle back exersize, but I don't do that much cause Jessie just does it soo good everytime.

The narrative of the book is beautiful in its simplicity and it conveys all the sadness of their situation. I fell in love with the narrator, the other boy (whose name is never mentioned) because of his innocence and unswerving loyalty to his friend and I love Luo for the same reason, because he is always ready to help out his friend. In this terrible context their friendship is so pure that not even a totalitarian regime or fear can break it, not even a girl. I also enjoyed how the author shows that the novels the boys read are not only a way of escaping their reality but also a way to learn about passion and feelings. The ending, while abrupt and painful, is also a hymn to the freedom that knowledge can provide, a little ray of hope for the only character who can actually have any. It left me with a bittersweet feeling because while I know the seamstress is doing what is best for her, it also seems selfish and cold-hearted.
So we made a deal: I live my life in the world of humans, working and thinking and talking and, when it's too hard, she shows me the wonders she's lived and seen and pondered. Then, every once in a while, we meet again and for a few glorious hours live in a beautiful world.
First off, this is a topic that I can get a little passionate about. Nothing too scary, I promise. That said, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CHURCH THESE DAYS?! I know I’m not the only one who has heard people talk about how hypocritical Christians are, how useless faith is, how the last place they would ever want to go is to a church. This is warfare, people, and too often the Church poses no threat to the enemy; in fact, sometimes we pose a threat to our own side.

Bodegas Julian Chivite’s Gran Feudo Rosado is a classic Navarra region rosado.. It is a popular favorite in Spain as well as here in the USA. Made from all Garnacha grapes, this traditionally styled wine displays strawberry and watermelon aromas with bright acidity and a touch of minerality to tie everything together. This lightly fruity rosado wine makes for some classic Spanish refreshment.
When I picked a career, I chose a path which would be immensely financially rewarding. I’ve been careful not to be in any serious relationships for fear that things were not where they needed to be at the time. Sure, many idealists would argue that she has to love you for you, but frankly – I would never advise my own daughter to marry a man who didn’t have his life in order. I appreciate my future wife for thinking the same way. Would I date someone seriously at this point with the intention of marrying them? Only one person. We will save that topic for another day. But candidly, she always knew I would be professionally successful. What she didn’t know, was that she was one of the biggest motivations that helped when I was down. Her memory and words kept the lights on, on more nights than I care to admit.

Because it is not Mother's cloth, Fatima. In fact, mothers go through a nice period of NOT having to use such things. But I digress... It all started for me more than 3 years ago. I have always been interested in living and eating healthily. And as I became aware of what was happening to this world of ours, I became very interested in living with a smaller footprint on the world. For many years I have been unhappy with the choice in so-called feminine products. The disposable-ness of them, the bleached white-ness of them - to think of putting some of the worst chemicals next to the most tender part of my body just never seemed right. I had long ago given up using tampons for the same bleached-white reason and because they stopped feeling good to me. I noticed that I felt more bloated when I used them.

Life goes in seasons and it was after about 6 years with that church that I lost Gods vision for my life. I created my own vision based on what I thought was more important to me. I had allowed the hard times to get bigger than God in my head and that wore me out quicker than anything. Yes, in case you didnt know, when you are planting a church you almost always have to work another job to pay the bills. In my case, I had gotten up to working three jobs and was still basically broke. I had a wife, and 3 kids. I was living in my father in laws house. I had school debt. I had medical bill debt. My life looked nothing like what I had always pictured in my head. Nothing. Thats when I dropped church. Thats when I said to myself “I have been living my life in sacrifice to others and their ministries for years and got nothing back. I cant even rent an apartment!!”. Thats when I started MY vision for MY life. Guess what? My vision didnt work out so well. I was working to make my first million before turning 30 and I was well on the way. In a couple months the business I had started with a good friend was in staring down contracts with ABC Disney and Clear Channel Radio. That part was looking good. However, I was never home. I didnt talk to my wife. I hardly spent any quality time with my kids. I was just working. Without going into all the junk that followed, I will just say this. I hit my rock bottom and God was again the first thing on my mind. It was then when He began to restore me.
There are many who will sneer at the comparison of radical Islam and the Nazi Party, but those who do so are either wilfully ignorant or deliberately evil. What ideology wished to exterminate the Jews? What ideology wished to murder the homosexuals? What ideology had global domination as its central theme, for which it was prepared to use violence and terror? What ideology revered its leader as a prophet who could do no wrong? What ideology thought of women as second class citizens fit only for religious study, the bedroom and the kitchen?

nts, flower prints, etc.,but they don´t even know of where it comes from or who put hem together in an outfit; Brian wore those things that now are topic fashion trends in the latests seasons; those wine coloured jackets , black striped suits, ankle leather boots, striped t shirts, Snake skin shoes, dandy hats, old jewelry, fur coats, flower prints, enormous sun glasses, silk foulards and golden jewelry; almost every item that he wore, mixed and defined his style is now a trend clue.

The Belgian track is what I consider to be the best song ever made in Belgium (some Belgians will immediately declare me insane right now, I guess). It's got a wonderfull and haunting melody, a distinct and strong voice and very sarcastic lyrics. "Dag vreemde man" ("Bye stranger") by the late Ann Christy could've become an international hit if it had been promoted in the right way, because there is a ressemblance with Cilla black or even Dusty Springfield.

I should have went to another exit. I made assumptions about the group due to the time of day (8:00 a.m.). The men looked like college staff members because they were holding papers. The men were casually dressed. No one had an ID badge. My assumptions could have been incorrect.

I thank you, Lord, for 54 years on this earth. I give you praise and honor for the successes that you have given me in this life. I’m not famous, I’m not really anybody to speak of, and that’s okay. You have given me a wonderful wife and two marvelous children (not to mention a pretty awesome son-in-law), and I am blessed beyond my wildest dreams. I pray that you might grant me 54 more more years, but whatever you choose to give me, I will live it for you, and do my best to honor and glorify you through it all.
The most effective offensive maneuver is a preemptive one. The United States government might get antsy and dispense with the prospect of gaining any knowledge, wisdom, or new technology the object may have to offer in lieu of preventing an Independence Day-like assault on our precious American soil.
The spare minutes left over after planning, organising and running rehearsals, not to mention checking on all the various backstage teams and emailing out a whole variety of notes, were mostly spent working, sleeping or just trying to get some form of sustenance. For the record two packets of crisps definitely does not qualify as a satisfying or healthy dinner option. Oh, and praying. There was an awful lot of that.

Heinrich's son, Christoph, established a new Schumann porcelain factory in 1881, It was located in the town center beside the market square. Schumann porcelain was also located beside the railroad tracks that forced the closure of his father's factory a few years earlier..That factory was later inherited by his son and it became Carl Schumann Porcelain.
The third course is a new addition the menu, a confit cube of ocean trout sheathed with a ruby red layer of pomegranate jelly. Its flavours are echoed in the seeds of fresh pomegranate that harmonise texturally with the briny bursts of fresh trout roe. Shreds of Noosa crab are sweet and succulent.
If you didn’t know, I’m from Ohio. And though I was not directly affected by 9/11, I still remember exactly where I was and who I was with. I remember what our teachers told us and what the principal said on the announcements. I remember watching it over and over for the next few days wondering what in the world is going on. But never, for the life of me, did I expect to one day be living where it all happened. To meet people who were here, who watched it live, who lost friends and family. I never thought Josh would live next door and work across the street (I also didn’t know Josh in 7th grade). I now love hearing their stories – somehow they all tend to be inspiring, like, “Here I am 10 years later – living.”
This time, I did something slightly different. I actually asked the cashier at the liquor store if he knew whether or not people frequently left their kids in the car while they went booze shopping. He claimed to have no clue, but mentioned that people frequently brought their kids into the liquor store while they went shopping.

The time has come that I've been dreading—looking for a new car! After 12 years and nearly 220,000 miles, my 2000 Toyota Camry is ready for retirement. Apparently, I'm not the only one keeping my car longer than usual. A recent NBC nightly news edition revealed that with the poor economy, people are keeping their cars longer than ever and that the average age of vehicles on U.S. roads has increased to 10.8 years. I'll be sad to see my trusty Camry go as it's been so reliable. After all, how many cars can you get more than 200,000 miles out of these days? Mine is still running well at 218,676 miles but with the high miles, we don't feel we can take it on long road trips anymore.
Well we did it! We kicked off our promising-to-be busy 2012 at the Muskoka Wedding Show this past weekend. Being ‘newbies’ to the event we weren’t sure what to expect. It’s a great time! A weekend of chatting up happy couples, snacking on delicious treats, toasting a glass of wine with new friends, and soaking up all things wedding. Did we mention the wine?!

But what I was thinking is this. God created so many good things for us to enjoy. First, in the Genesis account, if you are a man, he created woman. Good call God. All of us men say thank you! For the women reading this, the same is true, as God intended for us to walk side by side enjoying each others company and doing life together. But we couldn't do it without breath. We couldn't experience the joy and....heartache of relationship without breath. We couldn't experience the sunrise with a good cup of coffee in the morning without breath. Or take in a view of Grand Canyon. Or listen to a great piece of music and be moved to the core of who we are without breath. Or taste a meal with such complexity, flavors so well balanced that we want to savor each bite. Or for those with children, to just watch your child sleep. Without breath, none of this is possible.
or did it start when we entertained for the first time?
The good thing was that two men have a caring attitude, I must say because of giving me water and food and asking me to take a break, to eat, Hohoho, It’s awkward and funny but I like how kind, approachable and joker they were.
'Ikrima (a religious scholar) said: At first Muslims disliked it (Jihad), but later they loved it and said: "We listen and obey." And that is because the submission to the order to fight means hardship, but if the reward is made known it becomes to compare the hardship involved and its reward.

This view is from somewhere near the Blue Ridge Parkway. It was years ago that we were visiting friends in their new home way outside of town. Our host was eager to lead us on a walk on the extended property behind their home. We hiked through the woods where he seemed to be already acquainted with every tree. When we came upon a clearing at the edge of the woods I snapped a few photos. I was drawn to a stand of trees at the top of a distant hill. I remember him commenting that he also liked that view with the row of trees. I hope the trees are still there.
Mine is my second/storage closet in my bedroom. It has served me well over the past year and a half. Of course, now that I’ve divulged this secret – I may need to make some changes. hmmm. Anyway, please don’t think this is just for a guy we want to date. It took 5 or 6 years before Cosby ever saw my apartment slightly dirty – but he also never looked in my storage closet. So maybe it was a mutual understanding.
This is probably my favorite, for it reminds me so much of Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. It has such great elements - a train, the car, the gloves, and that cool hat - and also the fact that the woman is driving the car.

I know this is a repeat, but I spent days trying to learn a computer program that was supposed to make pattern making easier and have gone full circle back to inkscape. I haven’t given up on the program yet, I have a couple weeks left in the free trial, but so far it feels harder. Hopefully it will become easier and it can help me get these patterns out faster. I can grade this in inkscape pretty easy, so I will have 6 and 8 up soon. I may put up 18, but I’m concerned about grading that far out from size 10. We will see.

If God appeared and says I can only write or read – it would be write. Every time. Writing is about more than putting words on the screen. I write in my head all the time, because I live in my imagination, and so much of what I see I always look further at it, creating characters and stories all the time. If I couldn’t write, I couldn’t think. I’m very lucky.

Long writing day yesterday. Only got one chapter done, but it ended up being the longest of any of my chapters so far. As I was writing it, I kept reminding myself to let the chapter go where it wanted, but was intrigued to see that it was going in a direction where I could possibly use part of "The Game" near the end. My original goal for this novel was to use a lot of my shorter published pieces and sort of knit them together to form one coherent story, but sadly, I haven't been able to do much of that.
A typical Filipino man is always dominated by women throughout his life. First, he is dominated by his mother, then a girlfriend, then his wife, then his daughter, then his mistress, then maybe a “chimay,” if he is a “chimay” killer, then by Mama Mary when he is old, gray and dying. Who is at fault in the relationship, the man or the mistresses?

We are the “racists” if we resist they chided, whilst they set about producing a hundred thousand books, movies and TV shows depicting us as vile and filled with hate, yet it is we who are the victims of race hate, we who are the main victims of race hate crimes and we who are being driven from our towns and cities, many, such as our capital, we have already all but surrendered. It is we who are being ethnically cleansed.

Instead of going through all the 36 hours of nightmare trial and errors, let me tell you what my solutions could have been, and then what it was. I’ve found that these symptoms are the result of several possibilities, all with much the same answer. These things are trial and error resolutions, so best you have all the possibilities in one spot, unlike me who hunted and hunted with little sleep.
And to think, when I booked this outdoor October wedding, I was most worried about it being too cold to play outside. Ha. The sun was intense; it felt more like August than October. And the winds were so strong, I couldn't even put music on the music stand - it would have blown into the next county. So I played the prelude, processional, commitment ceremony and recessional music from memory. As I did, I held onto the harp with both knees and both elbows against the gusts.
My goal was to get under 24 hours and for the first 23 miles or so I was on track. The snow was bad up top and down the back side of Immigrant Pass (I fell 3 times in the snow) but I made good progress.

The questions for Vus, on the other hand are "Do you love her?", "Have you provided for her?", "Do you satisfy her?", "Have you tried to give her more children?" (I thought I would lose the lunch that I hadn't eaten yet at this point?" and finally, "Do you want her?" (p. 252). Clearly, this cannot be taken as a fully representative sample of the questions asked, but some vast difference between them are obvious. At the close of the book, Maya decides to give him 6 months more, on the basis that he had never "willingly mistreated her" (p. 254, one assumes, aside from the times he expressly forbade her to do things, treated her as less than a child, cheated on her, ground his body foulsomely against another woman in her presence, and ordered her around).

So if our plot is something like "A woman meets husband (Tom) at his parents home in Manhattan for Christmas, but falls for another man(Dawes) after seeing Tom at his absolute worst, and Dawes at his absolute best." But what is the point? The drama and conflict is good and all. But if the point is not to get a laugh from the reader, i.e. we are not writing comedy, then we need to have a point that is unspoken but is driven home. Not only is it important that we remain true to proving this premise(and thus keeping our plot directed and know when the story is over) but it is important that we remain loyal to this premise (again to keep our plot directed and to prevent confusion within the reader). For instance we could write a premise for this plot of "adultery is bad" since we haven't written the end yet, it is possible that we could make that premise work, but it would be weak. A better premise would be something like "sometimes you need to break the rules to remember why you made them" i.e. "sometimes you need to find love outside of your marriage to remember why you fell in love in the first place" or maybe even "marriage cannot prevent true love" (if we want her to truly fall in love with this new guy). Another premise we could work with is "it is a man's duty to keep his wife interested in him". How about this premise: "old love is more powerful than new love" (we could make the new guy and her have a bit of history together). I could go on and on and on. Alright I'm bored, but the point is. Once you have organized, told and proven your story according to this point/premise, then you need to wrap it up and your story is done. You need to be consistent here. If you backstab yourself by abandoning your premise halfway through, the story will never reach its potential. Blah blah. I read far too many stories on this site without any actual point to them other than "I had a cool climax scene in mind and wanted to write!!!!"
One principle that George Osborne clearly does not subscribe to is that of progressive taxation. The Con Dems plan from 2013 onwards to cut a further £10 billion pounds worth of welfare. Rather more alarmingly it can be said that cutting taxes for high earners whilst slashing support for those less fortunate has merely highlighted the fact that the Westminster seems to have become a plaything of the rich elite and their friends.

This volume presents a bit of a conundrum. A lot of the material was really cool. We learned more about the hierarchy of the Soul Society. Specifically, we know about the fuedal Japan caste system that separates the shinigami from the regular souls (and also that Rukia and Renji both came from the lower castes originally. Also, we see the darker sides of Soul Society. Even in death, you aren’t reunited with your family which means that the things Ichigo and Rukia told Shibata when they cleansed him weren’t true (though you always got the idea during those scenes that Rukia was holding something back). You learn that the souls in the slums have a very low opinion of shinigami and that some people, like Ganju, don’t think that any of them are good. We know a little bit more about the process that is going to be used to execute Rukia, and through the introduction of a character named Aizen (whose true nature has been ruined for me by being roughly ten years late to this particular dance), we get hints that Rukia’s execution is certainly not normal and that someone may be pulling the strings to make it happen. However, for all of this cool stuff, the plot has gotten too complicated without becoming more substantive to back it all up. There were many, many new named characters introduced this volume, and to be honest, none of them really struck me as particularly interesting or compelling. I’d say Ichimaru was pretty bad-ass but he was introduced last volume. I’ve read where Tite Kubo just introduces new characters when he has writer’s block, and that unfortunately just means there could be dozens and dozens of flat and one-dimensional characters before I know it.
This time the city offered him $16,000 to reopen the street, which he and his lawyer fought until his death in 1840, by drowning, of all things.

To be honest, the beer could use six months for the flavors to come together. When you have high-hop, high-alcohol, and richly-malty beers, that's usually the case. These flavors could do with a bit of time to get to know each other. Put a few bottles away for winter and break them out with the roast beast. It'll be perfect then. If I was forced to rate the beer now, I'd give it a B+, but my guess is this will be an A by November.

I am about as Southern as it gets. Off the boat Southern. A good 300 years of heritage in Virginia and Georgia. I am of the first generation on either side of my family to move out of the south and stay out on purpose. There are plenty of reasons I did this, and one of them is certainly the institutional racism that infects the culture down there, so much so that racist notions were casually brought up by teachers in my high school to African American students during class time and no one, not even the African American students, batted an eye. If a teacher asks you “Why do black people like grapes so much?” in a Georgia class room, it’s really not that unusual.
The western US has suffered an increasing number of large wildfires in recent years according to a new paper in PNAS. The causes are droughts, a build-up of combustible fuels—largely from trees dying of heat and insect infestations—plus the spread of fire-prone species.

Okay, now this whole Danny-and-Kendra thing was really getting annoying. In my book, Danny was officially scum. And what really bugged me is that I thought he was perfect for Nicole. He seemed like a good guy. Now he’s turning out to be the villain in what was supposed to be a Cinderella story. I advised Nic via text to just forget him. The problem was, I was sure – I’d bet money on it – that Danny was going to come running back, and drop to his knees at Nicole’s feet, begging for another chance. I told my friend to try and pick herself up, to brush that dirt off and pretend like He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named never even existed.

I performed my duties as Forensic Ballistic Specialist for the last 18 years of my police career, after completing a 3-year in-service training programme, based on the standards and requirements of the Association of Firearm and Tool mark Examiners (AFTE) - USA. Other forensic-related qualifications include a Diploma (Fss Dip) awarded by the Forensic Science Society (UK) and various certificate courses, among others, a firearm-related Forensic Chemical Investigations Course, and various Assessor/Moderator courses related to the use of handguns, shotguns, rifles and hand machine carbines. Prior to that time I had 7 years experience in various other police departments. My total service-period in the SA Police was thus 24 years. I accepted the government’s voluntary severance package at a time when Jackie Selebi was still the National Commissioner. This fact should already provide informed readers with a hint as to why I left the Farce.

“The feeling that you wake up not only rested, but blissful; that what you have thought of as challenges, as troubles — it is not that they disappear, but they do not weigh you down; that you have the energy to take on whatever tasks at hand you choose, but that you do not feel burdened, that you simply feel that you are doing almost without doing. It does not feel like a sense of disengagement, but rather higher engagement.”
I had a lot of fun researching this one. I have an inexplicable soft spot for dubstep and these songs really got into my head; I think my girlfriend got very sick of hearing me constantly singing, “our GOD is an AWEsome god, he reigns…”
That being said, we in the whiskey loving community should rejoice at this news. Buffalo Trace has done an admirable job keeping prices reasonable on its excellent bourbons and ryes. There are other companies that would easily be demanding three figures for something like the Antique Collection, but BT doesn't do that. I'm hoping that things like Clix Vodka help them keep our prices low. For every imbecile that buys a $300 bottle of Clix, that's more money that BT isn't charging me for bourbon. All hail the cash cow!
We pass our prejudices along to our kids, and those who are highly offended by the thought of society gradually beginning to accept the concept of gay teenagers are mortified by that prospect. So they encourage the hate while cloaking their venom behind words of sanctimonious indignation, and the kids watch and learn who they're allowed to despise, demonize, and bully.
I couldn’t, your presence in my life is worth too much to me.
Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (Foxconn) was founded in 1974. The company mainly deals with original design manufacturing. This means that companies make contracts with Foxconn to manufacture products that they have designed. With partners like Acer, Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Dell, HP, Intel, Microsoft, Motorola, Nintendo, Samsung, and Sony just to name a few, you would be hard pressed to find a person that has not used a product that was made at a Foxconn plant. 2011 revenues were over US$95 billion, which represents a 61% increase from 2010. Profits increased 7% to US$2.45 billon over the same time period (Worlds Biggest Companies, CNN). Although it has factories in Brazil, India, Malaysia, Mexico, and parts of Europe, it is most strongly associated with China. In fact, Foxconn is the single largest private employer in China. Foxconn is not just a job for these employees. Instead, it is a way of life. The company has campuses at its factories where all employees live. They have barracks for people to sleep, and cafeterias for people to eat. Employees very rarely go home to visit friends and family. And while these conditions may not seem ideal, Foxconn does provide a job to people who may otherwise not have been able to procure one. Approximately 75% of Foxconns massive 1.2 million person workforce is employed at one of its 13 Chinese locations. Despite the fact that Foxconn produces a wide variety of goods for a long list of companies, Foxconn is most closely associated with Apple Inc..
Looking back we do believe God told us to leave, but not for the reason’s we thought. God had us leave to humble us and bring us back.
Thank you both for such a beautiful shower!
I finally got around to washing the headband strap in my hard hat, for the first time. It was rank. And you may be thinking, “Haven’t you been in AmeriCorps since October?” The answer is yes. That’s about 7 months of ick built up. I’ve learned that part of this program is coming to terms with being dirty almost all of the time, particularly when your team is camping or trail building or both.
The only dominating species was humans, coming to oggle the shrine of gardens in a major city. I couldn't believe Dave and I have changed so much. Or maybe it has more to do with our changed surroundings? We don't live in the suburbs any more. We see all manner of wildlife on our doorstep, in our bushland garden. It's not that we're lucky to have what we do, but rather fortunate we didn't have the money to rip it all out and replace it with the kind of contrived "garden" we always wanted. Ninety-five percent of our five-acres remains natural bushland.
In the Shakespeare series he’s still in the midst of writing the work we know him for (great!) but he also randomly comes up with lines and ideas which we know from Star Trek and Indiana Jones (bah!). I’m never going to believe he might die if he’s making up stuff I know from the 20th century. I’ve already suspended my disbelief, don’t break it! Less is more. Also, don’t lose me by jumping the shark or applying plot duct-tape.
It was a spontaneous moment. It will be Sunday morning tomorrow and what better time to have something indulgent. I had a few fresh blueberries leftover and about 3 to 4 ounces of Chevre goat cheese and I was standing in front of fresh bread at the farmers market. The raisin studded Challah just called out to me. It had been a while since I indulged in making French toast so it was time.
Please watch this. It isn't long, but it is very important.
damn, i never saw that coming! RIP

The 5-star book was the wonderful A Room with a View by E.M. Forster. I’ve recently started collecting those iconic Penguin Classics trade paperbacks, the ones with the black bottom border. This was a recent addition to that collection, but I had read it before, many years ago. I think it provides a wonderful introduction to Forster. It’s got great characters, who Forster both pokes fun at and adores, and it’s full of humor and reflection on the nature of living an authentic life. It’s also pretty short. If you’ve only seen the movie, which is also wonderful, please read this.

Despite a history of over 90 years, to date there has been little published research on the use of distance education in the primary and secondary environment in New Zealand or other countries in Australasia. Barbour (2011a) examined 262 articles from the main distance education journals for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States (including the Journal of Flexible, Open, and Distance Learning) from 2006 to 2010 and found only 1 of the 262 articles related to distance education in the schools sector in New Zealand. Further, during this five-year period only three of the 21 articles published by the Journal of Flexible, Open, and Distance Learning related to primary and secondary distance education in any country.
New Years is coming and that is fun, but I'm not a person who plans my whole year around New Years. I do like to get all sparkly dressed (something about New Years makes me want to wear sparkly things) and go out for a little bit, but if we don't, then no big deal. Brian will be working, so he will not even be awake when midnight comes this year. Its only the change of a number, not really the true new year in my eyes, but still fun to celebrate if its possible. Too bad sometimes drama and fights have to break out because people just drink too much on New Years...something that we attempt to avoid, places with over drinking and strong emotions. People can really get hurt physically and emotionally when those two elements are mixed.
The last thing she needs is for him to be the only one who can save her from losing her dance academy, the dream she has worked so hard to turn into a reality.
But I don't know if the cold is worse to wake up to than what Leo woke up to. I heard him stirring in bed after I finished drying my hair. And then I heard him open the door to the bedroom on his way to the living room, and I tried to catch him in time...
I suppose 11:00 wasn't so late for me, but I didn't sleep well the night before when SH was up all night because I am a delicate princess who is highly attuned to her surroundings and hearing a husband working in the office upstairs and wondering when he is going to come to bed is not restful.
Sunday we had a small birthday party, for my kids and their cousins. What fun we had. My parents and grandparents all here for a birthday bash! We had a great time. When the party was over, I thought I’d give our dog, Molly, a special treat, leftover hamburgers that were on the plates.

Slow pitch softball is starting!!! I still have first game jitters because of “the incident” but I can’t wait to play. This year is going to be so much fun because my girlfriends are playing, it’s me, Carli, Sato, M’liss and Taylor. I played with and against all of them in high school and on my summer team. The boys are Dustin, Paul, Parker, Tyson and Mike. Yay for softball!

If you are going to be looking for a source of meat and it’s just you and a couple other people that you will be looking after, then something like a pig will not work. Seeing this as well, because I don’t necessarily want or will have ten extra people with me and my family, I looked further to find a compatible source of protein. After a lot of research and weighing options, I have decided to go with rabbits.
That’s one of the biggest reasons why I don’t have a facebook fan page (besides the obvious- the fear of not having anyone to like my fan page!). I know fan pages require constant updates and interactions. And even though I would like to be interactive, I am very lazy with such things.
in the last week there has been a payday and many reasons to celebrate. So, I am afraid I have to admit, I have spent quite a few occasions in the last 7 days partaking of a fine and tasty beverage in a good pub. Here are some details of my excursion into Tuesday temulency.

I have only a few cons for this book. The first was the number of characters. A lot of character names were mentioned, and a lot of characters had small parts, which caused me to get lost in all of the names and often question who exactly the author was talking about, which resulted in some frustration. The other con was that, due to the fast-paced nature of the book, some of what happened seemed very convenient, and almost had to be written off.
If you’re reading this blog chances are you are looking to improve your game and learn about the attraction and seduction process. The material in this blog is meant to teach men about social dynamics that influence female decision making behavior and improve success with women. I try to to answer the question “How Do You Get A Girl?”. The topic that I will discuss today has to do with the importance of active listening to improve communication.
So this has taken the wind out of my sails I must admit. I do feel down about it all but know I now need to be very strict (I have been slacking a bit on writing down everything I eat and the exercise eased up a bit last week too) with everything and really push on. I can't be demoralised by it - look at the people who lose 10 stone and then have to lose another 10 stone to reach goal weight. That must be demoralising.

How are you all? I feel like it's been awhile since we've interacted (then again...that's all my fault)! I hope you are all having a wonderful spring. I just love spring (however I feel like it is short-lived in Arizona). I have never experienced a TRUE spring - the one that I read about in books where the snow begins to melt and the animals come out of their warm homes. Because we live in the desert, the spring I experience is the sudden sound of crickets, or seeing ants on sidewalks, or warnings that the rattlesnakes are out again. But what I do love about spring is seeing the green leaves begin to grow on trees again. It is seeing green grass stems start growing from our lawn. And this year, we have a great supply of jasmine in my backyard planter box. I have enjoyed cutting it and putting some in vases throughout the house. And each morning it is so cute because Claire comes and sits by them and smells them.

But on the way back, we happened upon a music shop. After a sideways glance into the store, Paul made and about-face and marched right in. His face was glowing. Here in Cusco he found the instrument he has been looking for since a family trip to Spain four years ago. He asked the shop-owner if he could hold one, and she said it was called a Chorango. He played around with a couple, oohed over their looks and just glowed because he had finally found the instrument that garnered his curiosity a few years ago. He didn’t buy it then, because we were leaving on the Trail the next day. But we made a note of the prices and where the shop was, and promised to return.

Sometimes, sometimes, just sometimes my life runs like the well oiled machine it really is. A doctor’s appointment at 9 meant I could drop the cherub off at school to make sure he got there in time for his exams, his Big Standard Grade exams.
Hank Moyer known to be a rowing enthusiast, says; “I rowed on Kodai lake since when I was 11 years old and lived at Benderloch (1939-1941), and continued rowing there until I was 16 (1944). To row from Benderloch to the far end of the lake where it is marshy takes about 10-15 minutes of steady rowing.
So, from where did the US Government get the idea for the number five, if not the scientific studies? I was closing in. Marion Nestle, nutrition professor at New York University, thinks she remembers exactly where. “It was Susan Foerster, the head nutritionist in California. She had the bright idea of promoting fruit and vegetable consumption in a state which was a big fruit and vegetable producer.”

With new ownership around the corner, the Dodgers have reason to believe they will return to 2nd behind the Lakers, which makes sense. USC sports is ranked 2nd right now, which is amazing because they are not a pro team. Even when the Dodgers rebound, the Lake Show, Doyers and Trojans being the top three tickets in town aren’t surprising. What DIDN’T make the list is what shocked me.

The baby I mentioned was from our church. This was his second stint in intensive care and his parents had been through a lot. The entire church was praying for him. God didn’t “need” my prayer to heal him. But He wanted me to pray so that I may be blessed, just by praying for that sweet child. And I was!
Jack laughed. “Your sense of humor is what keeps you alive. There are only two reasons a street rat would pique your interest.

The pair set off on a road trip back to L.A. The journey is predictable only in that they learn an awful lot about themselves and one another along the way. The movie plays as a drama, but with some peculiar, dark comedic bits peppered throughout. Much of the background music consists of country tunes, which made me think that country artists have come a long way over the years – and there is nary a k.d. lang song to be heard.

Pollack actually snarled. Pevan and a couple of the guardsmen stepped back, but the Sherriff knew the law. He let Van Raighan drop to the ground. The thief staggered slightly, but straightened with a glare at the big man. He glanced at the circle of guardsmen, raising an eyebrow when he saw Pevan, then raised a hand in front of him. That was where the Clearviewing had ended. Rel took a clumsy step forward on legs suddenly stiff with anticipation.
So excited was I! And my parents were intrigued (they drink a beer here and there, especially while on vacation). Little did I know that a storm was brewing--literally. Hurricane Earl was threatening the East Coast and many projected paths had it hitting Maine on Friday. The day I was scheduled to fly out. Portland (and thus its airport) is right on the coast. Delta was offering travelers the chance to reschedule flights free of charge. Reluctantly, I rescheduled to fly out a day early--squashing any plans of brewery tours or tastings. Of course, as we know now, Earl petered out and became a tropical storm, dumping rain and churning up the sea, but nothing worse. Figures.

I let my mind wander. Think about the object. Jump from subject to subject. I found myself thinking about the old technology, and time. A quote from T.S. Eliot popped into my head; "In my beginning is my ending." From there, I thought about Janus, the Roman god of beginnings and endings. I know when the idea is starting to come for me, so out comes the sketch book. I start listing elements that fit the theme. I'm not going to post my sketches here. They're incredibly messy--I tend to sketch and then over sketch. I like to leave space for the sculpture to grow organically, so I tend not to plan out every element of a piece beforehand.

I can tell you that I've been in and out of my cocoon many times over the last 11 years. I'll chomp chomp chomp on those green leaves ... waiting for - whatever - to happen so I'll know it's time to get to the real work of transformation. Then I'll get wrapped up in the process of eating right, exercising, keeping a food journal - and any other requirements from whatever crazy diet I'm trying out. All from the safety of my cocoon.

How about a fictional real world example: I want to determine whether the local natural gas company's fracking plans will provide a net benefit to my community. I listen to both sides discuss the issue at the local town council meeting. The gas company uses an article in a peer reviewed journal to support its case that fracking is safe and environmentally friendly; I want to back-check the company's claims, so I look-up the article on-line, and learn that it would cost me $65.00 to purchase it--ouch. I check with my local library, but it doesn't carry a subscription to that article and doesn't have the resources to procure a copy for me. I ask the gas company, but I get nowhere....Hmm, wouldn't life be better (and wouldn't it be easier for me to fulfill my role as a good citizen) if the journal was open source.
The president has repeatedly objected to any short-term deal, calling it “kicking the can down the road,” because there is a likelihood that the two sides would reach the same gridlock next year once such an extension was set to expire, and he did so again on Friday.

Because we had discovered and embraced unschooling when Liam was so young, I feel that we have been given a pass to avoid the usual pitfalls that many folks may believe go hand-in-hand with living with a teenager. Liam has always been shown consideration, compassion, empathy, respect, and kindness, and he is now extremely considerate, compassionate, empathic, respectful, and kind. I guess I was that way, too, as a kid, but perhaps a bit more out of fear (fear of punishment, fear of judgment, fear of ridicule, fear of a butt-swatting). Liam knows no fear of these things. He is considerate, compassionate, respectful and kind because it is a sort of cultural norm for him (in our family's culture).

Doubt and faith in painting are inextricably entwined. Vermeer’s faith in painting was pitched against Calvinist iconoclasm and suspicion of the “idolatrous cult of painted images” (Arasse, p.83). This iconoclasm is not doubt, but rather an extreme certainty in one religious belief that is in conflict with competing beliefs. Vermeer’s defense of his painting was an immersion in the practice, his “workplace, his laboratory of constant pictorial research”, an entrenchment of faith against suspicion.
The grip of vice and lawlessness on chaotic municipal governments kept the growing urban problem as far as ever from solution, until at last a régime of crime in Cincinnati goaded the populace to three terrible days of fire and riot in 1884. (4)

Samsung, however, sits atop the smartphone business, with a 29.1% share in the first quarter (42.2m phones by IDC’s estimate; the company does not give figures) compared to Apple’s 24.2% share (35.1m phones). Samsung’s portfolio is shifting towards smartphones, which presently make 45% of its worldwide 93.8m sales – compared to Nokia, pushed down to second place in the overall rankings, where 11.9m of its total 82.7m phones are smarpthones, a 14.4% share.
I can see many interesting game variations - defend a crippled ship, defend a specific location, add flak effects, add command ship effects, victory points, etc. This game really has the potential to be a great hook for folks who enjoy mini games to get back into them for not really a whole lot of start-up money. It is also something that a game shop could demo quickly and easily without a lot of set-up.
Calculating historic values of money is notoriously difficult because it depends on what you measure it against, and how that has moved in price relative to other commodities and general consumption. It’s easy to say that a pound would buy X amount of bread in 1800, for example, but that doesn’t take account of how much cheaper the inputs for making bread have become, or the fact that bread isn’t nearly as important an item of consumption now as it was two centuries ago. Economic historians have been shouting at one another about historical prices for decades, and there’s no sign of the storm letting up yet.
“While we were touring to promote our Nocturnal album, we met people affected by the struggle and hardships,” the group explains. “From natural disasters to the global economic crisis, we were moved to go back into the studio and reflect and convey what we witnessed and experienced.

If you're new to canning, this website has very good step-by-step directions. Canning seems intimidating, but it's really an easy thing to do. Just make sure and have all of your supplies organized, and you'll do great. Also, be careful not to burn yourself when taking the jars out and placing them back into the boiling water. Otherwise, you will wind up with a nasty burn. Trust me; I've learned the hard way.
13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.

Algerian sweets are very elegant and tasty. They are sweet and nutty. A blend of wonderful flavorings: nuts, vanilla, lemon zest, orange blossom water or rose water. Some are dipped in honey syrup, others beautifully iced and decorated with almond paste flowers. There are so many varieties. New amazing designs, stunning colors and delicate decorations keep popping out. Every time I visit Algeria, I feel so "yesterday" when it comes to these delicacies.

I appreciate any positive or negative feedback. Thank you.
While “Clutching Poochie” is both a story of spiritual triumph and historic significance, it also suggests a radically new way to deal with child sexual abuse: by allowing the stories to be told and celebrating the heroism, rather than the helplessness, of the victim.
I wish there was a similar platform on the web where I don't have to worry about catching up, where I would not feel inclined to share every little detail of my life and to say everything that I want to say. All in all, I wish for a cleaner and a simpler web.

But the Strangest thing, in recent memory? I've been around crafty folks way too long to have any concept of strange, ha ha! So I guess I'll cite the tiny spoons I've been hoarding since...um, June? On one of our trips to our local farmers market, we spent some time & money at the Wild Pea Hummous booth, and when the owner caught me tossing our sample spoons into my purse (don't worry, they were well-licked!) he offered me a few clean ones. He also offered me his collection of used spoons, but I decided that was too big of a commitment for someone who didn't even know what she was going to use them for! But don't worry, once I figure that out I'm heading right back for some hummous!
Cameron ripping out the introduction to Understanding Poetry with a ruler might be the best character detail of the whole movie. Also, can we ascribe his worminess to the difficulty of maintaining a perfectly shaped crew-cut with red hair? No wonder he is clinched tighter than a Tea Partier’s purse-strings.

Other than their recordings, very little remains of the original Ink Spots (officially, they continue to perform to this day, with a 'conveyor belt' approach to the line up). Not the original line up, but here is a clip of one of the later line ups (still with Bill Kenny on vocals) performing Do I Worry as a musical interlude in the 1942 Abbott and Costello film Pardon My Sarong. Orville Jones has gone by this time, and his replacement is awful! A horrible rasping voice that is quite unnerving!

Anyway, as expected, Ronnie breaks up with Enid, but not before getting all grabby in the car and being generally awful to her. While he's berating her about George, she covers her face with her hands while crying, so he "pried them away, forcing her to look at him. His fingers bit into her wrists, cutting off the circulation". What the HELL Ronnie!? Let go of her, you horrible fuckbag! Maybe Jessica was actually doing her a favour, in her own skewed, sociopathic way.
Say the word Cookie to anyone and these immediately come to mind: large, buttery, chewy cookies chock full of chocolate chunks and nuts with the tangy, fruity, festive addition of dried cranberries. Nothing says home quite like a batch of freshly baked Chocolate Chip Cookies warm from the oven. The cinnamon adds a warm note and a golden caramel color to these classic treats.

Never mix the lye and water in the same area where my dogs or cats (or kids, of course) are. I always mix my lye and water in the basement and wait until the fumes have completely dissipated before I bring it upstairs to use in the kitchen. It is also a good idea to keep your pets gated out of the area in which you are going to work, just in case there's a spill.
The large flowers were made with grungepaper and Wendy Vecchi stamps and glued to bamboo skewers which I'd inked with DI Forest Moss. The flower in front was made using tattered florals and a spiral rose. Although they can't really be seen there are also other two flowers on the base made from tissue and dictionary papers which had been cut with spellbinders, coloured with the inks and scrunched up to look like carnations.
We are all struggling, this is true. I sorta hate that I’ve added to the glut, in many ways. I’ve resolved to slow down on the releases for a while and let people catch up. One official album a year, and maybe a few 7″s and things. But I’m writing constantly, and my brain gets to be like a computer than needs to be defragged, or have it’s hard drive cleaned. This is when I put out a record!

College sophomore Samantha Hughes is in need of her own place. Her current living situation on campus is less than ideal, as she's stuck with a dorm mate who consistently leaves a sweatsock hanging from the doorknob--a variation on the ol' Knockin' Boots indicator. Samantha has found the ideal apartment, but being a student she is a little lacking in the funds department, so it's almost like kismet when she reads about a babysitting job on a campus bulletin board.
One year ago today, I wrote my very first WordPress blog post. If you’re curious, or simply feeling the suffocating pillow of nostalgia, that first post can be found here. Still… it’s been quite a year for me. A year ago I had no film crew, an unpublished novel, an unsuccessful YouTube channel, and an unfinished website. Now, one year later, I have a film crew! OK… so those were bad examples, but there really have been some very interesting changes in my life, and I would like to talk about one in particular for just a minute because, not only do I have this blog to thank for it but, ironically, it is also partly responsible for my recent absence from it.

When you work in retail, the holiday season is a busy time. Our bookshop gets flooded with gift-giving inquiries about various out-of-print titles, last-minute shoppers and daily trips to the post office to mail gift packages. Our eldest daughter was busy with her part-time jobs too, so all we wanted to do was collapse into a heap on Christmas Eve night, enjoy a lovely supper (cooked by the younger daughter elf as her present to us all) and then veg out with books, movies and Scrabble.

Researchers at Penn State University have followed up their initial report, that again is being widely reported in the media (I heard about it first via National Public Radio.) It seems that the interaction between the ants and their parasitic fungal species is far more complicated than proposed earlier, and this new study models the spread of the fungus within the population of ants in a colony, as opposed to between individuals.

The survivors had learned early on that the infected were not the typical fare of zombie that were found in cheesy movies or comic books. They possessed intelligence that enabled them to work together. The infected would work in groups of three, like wolves, to corner and trap their prey. Along with their apparent intelligence, the infected also had heightened hearing, smelling and sight. A trade-off for the lack of vocal abilities. The survivors were at a major disadvantage to the infected, because anything they could do to take any of the infected down would only serve to bring more near them.
Respect isn’t a skill or a body of knowledge; it’s an attitude, an approach, and an action that describes a connection to someone or something. Respect is recognizing and believing in the importance and value of another being, or even of ourselves, and communicating that recognition through our behavior. The absence of respect may be more noted by others than its presence because respect is often quiet. English uses the convention of nouns and verbs, but like many words in the English language, respect is both a noun and a verb, and it always takes an object. I thought of the exercises that I was taught in school so many years ago, in which we diagrammed sentences to give a visual structure showing the relationship of each word to the whole. But words themselves are complex things and contain many concepts and relationships.

LA: Well, first, it's early days here, and this is our first and only YA acquisition as of this moment, but we took it on with the expectation of publishing it in the YA section of the bookstore, not the adult section. It's too soon for me to discuss strategies though as to what drew me to it, Household Gods was actually submitted to me first, as an adult fantasy offering, and I fell in love with it, and Ari's writing style and imagination, but felt it was too short for the adult SF&F category. I asked him if he could expand it, and to his credit, he told me honestly that he could not. But I loved - loved! - his style, and let him know how much I'd like to work with him, so we put our heads together, he showed me five different proposals, and The Goblin Corps, a tale of an elite military force of orcs, goblins, trolls, kobolds, etc... in a Dark Lord's army, was the one I chose. He's just delivered that manuscript as of a few weeks ago - and it rocks! Meanwhile, I never forgot Household Gods, and then one day it hit me like a ton of bricks that with its teenage protagonist it really was a YA, and its word count wasn't problematic for that category either.

Is this a bad thing? No. If you have read now admittedly dated The 7 Habits, you might find The 3rd Alternative underwhelming. If you haven’t, it would behove you to skip it and go straight to this, which has similar content and almost identical messages, but is written from a 21st century perspective instead of that of the good old days of the bullish late 1980s.

First, the rejection of Petrine authorship is anything but ‘certain’. Secondly, arguments from silence are weak and are arbitrary in their orientation and application. Third, though 2 Peter wasn’t rapidly spread throughout Christendom, wherever 2 Peter was known, it was embraced. Fourth, arguments from language are flippant and are reveal more about the presuppositions of those who employ them than they do about the words to which they are applied. Fifth, when 2 Peter is given a consistent read and treated as Petrine, all the internal objections are met with reasonable solutions. Sixth, pseudepigraphal works were always rejected buy the church and prevented from canonical status. Finally, skepticism fuels rejection of the Petrine authorship of 2 Peter every bit as much as scholarship. Brewer, after 110 pages of interaction with skeptical scholarship on the issue, writes “The main factor keeping scholars from Petrine priority is their “presupposition that the Bible is not the supernatural revelation from a supernatural God”.[98] Regardless of the interaction and refutation given them, skeptics will continue to be doubters of God’s word in search of reasons to justify their doubt.

It uses the tried-and-tested almost perfect method of turn based battling, and everyone has special moves and power-ups and magical spells and stuff. Outside of battle, you navigate a 2D map complete with charming sprites which were all the rage way back, and you get to navigate traps and bottomless pits and the like. That feature didn’t come into RPG’s until several years into the future. I love that whole depth in Wild Arms, how it feels more like an action game when you’re navigating the map and how it feels more like an RPG in the battle.

So what are the benefits of living with a musician? For those of you who have never tried it, imagine watching something appear from nothing – a song being birthed, if you will, in completion, from the mind and hands and voice of a person. Creation of music, to me, is far more compelling than creating a child. Any animal or insect can produce offspring, are in fact designed and programmed to do so, but only a special kind of person can produce music. Music is joy, pain, and every emotion in between. It drives everything from a march to a mosh, and causes emotional reactions in everyone that can hear or feel it.I get the pleasure of living with someone who compulsively writes songs, plays many instruments and sings for me. This is the gift I get for loving a musician.

It seems that everywhere I turn around lately there are babies. I love babies! My baby making days are over, I think. I would kind of like one more but I have my hands full with the two I have, I'm not a spring chicken anymore, and (probably most importantly) there's no man in my life. It does take two to tango. I've been blessed with two beautiful children and I'm grateful for that.

It's incrediby frustrating, and we've learned that published authors often go through this cycle even AFTER their work is out in the world being read and judged by others. Sometimes you just have to step back and let things roll the way they are meant to. Now, if you're not getting the response you would like from agents, by all means go back and tweak your story here and there, work on making it better, but we have to distinguish between our own insecurities and the flaws in our writing. I've had plenty of false alarms, and I'm grateful to have realized that it's not just in my head, but I do need to work on my story. And now it's finally coming to the point where those false alarms are coming up less and less. Pretty soon the real deal is going happen, and the querying process will begin. For real this time. Scary, but true. I'm sure you're all in a similar boat, trying to figure out if it's time, or if another false alarm has struck. Wherever you may be in your journey, I hope you succeed.
So what in the Circus of Horrors has upset the weak stomachs of the college authorities? One of the artistes, known as Captain Dan, is a dwarf who pulls household appliances with his private parts. Let me say at once that he is not one of those that I tutored. I never taught trainees to do anything with their todgers other than keep them in their pants. Dwarves being dwarves, however, they often took the expression of their creative impulses into their own hands.
Study after study has found that skin-to-skin care helps regulate babies body temperature, respiration, and heart rate better than any radiant warmer (heated baby bed) can. This is because mom's body is the ideal temperature for baby and mom will attend to babies needs immediately and decrease the probability that baby is stressed/crying/gasping to be nursed. (see IBC for more information).
To communicate a thought, Lubiano never uses one word where ten would do. She spends nearly six minutes “analyzing” an Obama speech to the Congressional Black Caucus (at 6.21 of the linked clip). After much verbiage, she comes to a conclusion that anyone looking at a typical political column could receive: that standard black political rhetoric often imitates the cadences and style of the Black church. Lubiano delivers this analysis while taking sure to note that she, herself, is a non-believer.
Until now Ronan had been encouraged to "boy-up" and it was planned to present Ronan as an everyday skater-boy. But with his girliness still showing through, the image just wasn't believable. So a decision was taken to encourage and allow Ronan to "release" and enhance his campness . Disgustingly, SYCO planned to sexualise him. They were well aware of course, that if they sexualised a young girl to look sexually older than she is, all hell would let loose. But with Ronan, as one executive put it, "no one has ever seen a 'gay' kid before, it'll be a novelty." As for the pre-teen market, it was accepted they wouldn't care if Ronan appeared gay or not...most probably don't know what gay is anyway. And so, with a total gaysexualisation of Ronan secretly planned, SYCO got to work. I should stress, Ronan's parents were not aware of any of this

We still face a challenge in setting up a fully functional office as well as producing a workers paper and we appeal to all working class organizations and individuals who share our objectives of smashing the capitalist system to help. Indeed the global imperialist system is facing a deep crisis that today is threatening key countries like Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Italy. Even in the heartland of America the protests by workers is taking on a political character not to mention the aggressive and brutal wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya over natural resources. The recent revolts in the Arab countries clearly shows the limitations of the capitalist system in its decaying phase.
First Hit #1: August 18, 1973
In the end, I don’t know the reason for the exclusion of Plath. If (and I emphasize this is an if) it has to do with real or perceived insensitivity in her work, I think Rita Dove is well positioned to make explain the point. Indeed, I can think of few people who could do it better (how I wish Reginald Shepherd had lived to write about this!). As my friend in publishing suggests, it would be far better for Dove to provide a full, in-depth explanation for the exclusion than to simply edit Plath out of this representation of American poetry. One might say Dove owes the world this explanation, not only to defend her editorial choices, but to inform us about how Plath looks from where Dove stands.
I had a good weekend painting away! My guys were doing home repair stuff that makes me a nervous wreck (definitely not a micro-manager, definitely not...) so I settled in to the studio. With my music turned way up and no one to disturb by singing along at the top of my lungs, I was feeling 'beachy'... And I found this photo I took last Summer on Cape Cod. As I was painting, the scene just felt comfortable... familiar, and I couldn't figure out why. As I was putting the last few brush strokes on, I realized, that my good friend Joan Brancale had painted this exact cottage from this exact angle (we both must have stood at the edge of their driveway), and her painting hangs in the dining room of her Summer home, where I have frequently visited. Oh, well, great minds think alike, I suppose!
My painting is third grade art at best. I used to paint every Sunday, especially in my mid-20s when I lived in Austin. It helped me get out of writing head when blocked by moving into a diffferent spatial sense. That move is now inhabited by designing and constructing handmade books. I used to say that I was a baby bookmaker. Maybe now I consider myself an adolescent one. I don’t know.

Put flour and seasonings in a gallon sized ziploc baggie. Shake vigorously, until mixed. Pull out one or two pieces of chicken from the buttermilk marinade(depends on the size of the pieces, really. On Godzilla-Chicken, one is all I can do) and let excess liquid drain off. Put the chicken in the ziploc baggie, shake it all about till chicken is coated. Pull out of bag, shake off excess flour, and put on a rack over a cookie sheet (mess cleaning made easy). Once all chicken is floured, warm your oil. Note, I said AFTER it's all floured up. The flour will have time to kinda soak up the buttermilk and help keep your coating ON the chicken if you give it this time to rest. Plus, it's coming to room temperature, a good thing when working with hot oil. Get the temperature of your cooking medium to 325F. Some say 300, some say 350. For me, 350 is too hot, 300 not quite warm enough. When you add food to the oil, it will cool down the oil, and oil temperatures below 300 (as will happen if that's the temperature you start at) can leave the food excessively greasy. When the temperature is right, add the chicken to the pan. Put the dark meats (legs and thighs) in the middle, where it will be a bit hotter, and the light meats (breasts and wings) around the edges. Cook for 10 - 12 minutes until golden, flip and cook for another 10 - 12 minutes.
So what am I working on... well I am quilting another quilt for a friend. My second commission piece.... YEAH! But OMG am I having tension problems and this is after the Bernina dealer worked on my machine for two hours! I don't know if it is the thread or needle or what. Finally, I have used a new needle, new spools of thread for both the blue top thread and white bottom thread AND lowered the top tension and tightened the bottom tension and think it is finally right.

During this summer, I was sharing the rental of a wonderful 80 year old cottage about 3 hours north of me that was just a remarkable, relaxing, rejuvenating place of tranquility for me with my brother and his partner. So many of my girlfriends had been such a help to me during this entire mess, had me for dinner, minded my son, etc. that I wanted to repay them by having them come up to the cottage and enjoy it with me.

For several days, I followed an established routine that felt for a while like it was working. I’d sleep late, then get up for about an hour or so to eat a bowl of cereal, read the newspaper and watch SportsCenter highlights, then head back to bed. After waking from this first of many naps that would soon follow, I might run out to the store to pick up a few items, or possibly take out the garbage, or maybe even both. It wasn’t much, but it provided enough personal fulfillment that I could head back to bed again for some reading.

I think it all boils down to the first attack of the mentals I had when I was at school. Severe paranoia, depression and anxiety, all not really helped by bullying and a bit of an eating disorder. It was all my parents could do to get me to leave the house, let alone get on public transport to go to school.
No, my friends, I do not speak in riddles. I speak in general terms so as to help as many of you as possible. You each have a different level of understanding and awareness, and you each will read the same words but derive a little different meaning and understanding. For some, English is a secondary language, and this too will cause some misunderstanding. However, I encourage you each to take-in these words with an open heart and ask for CLARIFICATION within.
This is not the only liberty I took… I sometimes find this confection to be overly sweet and somewhat adult-unfriendly, with its massive presence of rice bubbles and marshmallows.

There is plentiful evidence from business consulting firms including McKinsey & Co., and from Catalyst, a nonprofit research group, that companies with gender-diverse management teams experience higher growth in their share prices, better-than-average operating profits, and outperform their rivals in terms of sales, return on investment capital and return on equity, according to the report. That research showed that women asked more questions and made fewer reckless decisions, proving that “women are not a cost, women are a benefit,” Ms. Reding said.

When I did this last time, they just did it, with a big smile and said don’t worry about paying, just put some money in the charity box they had in the shop. Fantastic. I’ll come back with service like this – we’d come back anyway as we’ve used them lots over the years and they’re good. I ran in last Saturday early afternoon and the same guy was in and I asked the same question, if he could glue it on. No questions asked he just did it. And again no charge – just money in the box for charity. It happened to be a rugby day on Saturday with a big Army and Navy game on at Twickenham Stadium and I got chatting to another customer in the shop (whilst we waited). As I was chatting and waiting I noticed some signs on the walls in the shop. One fine example below…
Our wheeled home is just so almost there that we now have a proper sense of how it'll be when we're in it for good, and it is wonderful. We've made a beautiful home with a view that is always changing. Of course there are still cupboard doors and plugs and taps and bookshelves and desks and hooks and pictures to go in yet, but it isn't a horsebox anymore!

McLarens problems also delayed the testing of their DRS (Drag Reduction System) adjustable rear wing. To feed the hydraulics to the actuator mounted inside the middle of the rear wing, the team have routed a non-structural pylon up from the gearbox to the wing. This houses the hydraulic cables & sensor wiring and does little to support the upper rear wing.

Stephen King does a few things I would never recommend to an author. But he's Stephen King and can do what he wants, so who am I to complain? For one thing, King's direct reader address (using "you") works well in this book and helps me believe in Jake as a normal person who is just as confused as I about why and how this is all happening. As a general rule, however, I do not like direct address and do not recommend trying it without supervision. King also foreshadows a lot, which works for increasing the suspense, though often I find that authors want to utilize this tool in an ineffective way (ie. foreshadowing too much). And if I were to voice a minor complaint, it would be that at times the foreshadowing does feel a bit excessive.

There is the threat of high-school antics early on, but these are mercifully dropped quite quickly. A bit more development happens between Shu and Hare, and it’s certainly not unwelcome. Just as she’s about to confess, the train stops and a guy in a hoodie rushes on, knocking them aside, as he’s pursued by thugs. Pills scatter out of his pocket. It’s Yahiro. He and Shu go off to have a conversation. He explains things. Despite being told to leave, Hare tracks them in secret, and eavesdrops.
Documents were seized and published by the Bavarian government that laid out the whole plan — and some of the conspirators were arrested.

The first way is of course to become a giraffe. The second way is to become World of Warcraft. Third way is to be something called “hot”. Now Katie, I would argue that there are at least two distinctions of hot. There is the normal human definition which is that individual who seems suitable for mating. And then there’s the weird, culturally constructed definition of hot which means that individual who seems malnourished and has probably had plastic bags inserted into her breasts.

My nemesis tried to get me into closed room with three bosses so they could assert to me the seriousness of my situation. He was a one of the cronies of the burly pink guy. I need to buck up. I needed to show more enthusiasm. It was really my politics he could not stand. They had read my letter to a magazine that did a photo shoot of college girls naked, and I called the whole idea misogynist. He was on to me and he could not believe I was getting away with it. He must have had a harsh Italian childhood, beaten for not working hard enough, fed bootstrap stories, pulled away from video games by the ear; and here he saw me, a spoiled college grad, getting away with grounds for dismissal. He brought his two year old child to work one day on "Take Your Daughters" to work day (which he hated because it was liberal) and she ran up to me and clasped my leg. He was saying to everyone how the first words he taught her were, "Big government is the problem." Much to his horror and my surprise - I looked down at this blue eyed kid and picked her up.

Very healthy choice is to expend more calories, than the ones we intake, by increasing the physical activity; 30 to 60 min of daily light exercise, such as swimming, cycling, dancing or jogging is very effective, as it has a real effect on the energy balance (which is the balance between energy we need in order to be alive and energy we take with the food). Bear in mind that: by walking after eating we turn the calories into heat; eating after vigorous activity we turn the food into energy. Finally, by eating 4 to 6 times a day, the right food in the right amount, we produce more heat and consequently we lose weight. Also, when eating proteins and carbohydrates, the glucose rises in the blood and our appetite decreases; when we eat fats, the glucose in the blood is depressed without decreasing the appetite.

Being In Debt And Having Money Worries…..
Touch is the story of Martin Bohm (Sutherland) a very successful journalist who is now working odd jobs to help pay for the care of his autistic son. This is difficult as his wife was in Twin Towers on 9/11 and his autistic son has a really bad habit of escaping his special needs school and climbing cell phone towers. But what begins to make his life infinitely more complicated is that there appears to be a method to the random behavior of his son. His son somehow sees how even the slightest variable affects the entire world. And in the first episode, climbing the cell tower at a certain time, setting a few cell phones to ring at certain time and leaving a few numbers to be found he engineers a way for a bus of school children to be saved, stop a terrorist bombing, launch a woman’s singing career, and save a couple’s relationship. Oh, and convince his father that he can see the larger pattern. The episode ends with Martin convinced that his new purpose in life must be to follow the clues his son gives him to help make the world a better place. And if you think I’ve given spoilers, I haven’t. Because even knowing this won’t spoil the emotional force that the end of this episode has. If you have any humanity you will be crying. And it is not often that TV can make me cry…and certainly this is the first Pilot with characters I have not invested years into has made me cry. If even a tenth of the shows in this series are half as moving, this show, no matter how long it lasts will be one of the most powerful and well written shows in history.
Medicinal Uses: Lemon juice is widely known as a diuretic, antiscorbutic, astringent, and febrifuge. In Italy, the sweetened juice is given to relieve gingivitis, stomatitis, and inflammation of the tongue. Lemon juice in hot water has been widely advocated as a daily laxative and preventive of the common cold, but daily doses have been found to erode the enamel of the teeth. Prolonged use will reduce the teeth to the level of the gums. Lemon juice and honey, or lemon juice with salt or ginger, is taken when needed as a cold remedy. It was the juice of the Mediterranean sweet lemon, not the lime, that was carried aboard British sailing ships of the 18th Century to prevent scurvy, though the sailors became known as "limeys".

Despite this I find myself asking the same question of myself and our country every time the issue is raised. Why does it seem impossible for us all to work together? There are very few people in this world that are pro-global warming and even fewer that promote the cause of rising sea levels and yet gathering together enough global gumption to actually do something seems about as easy as herding Bonsai kittens.

But as a kid I was obsessed with British wrestling, and would watch World of Sport religiously every Saturday afternoon to catch all the latest bouts.... all enthusiastically commentated on by Kent Walton (and his weekly welcome of "greetings grapple fans"). One of my fondest memories of childhood, is the large chunk of the 70's when my dad would take me on a monthly trip to see the wrestling live. What a magical world it seemed to me back then... so glamorous, so exciting, such passion, and of course, such sport!

As Hell’s Kitchen improved after the successful fight to drive out the pimps and prostitutes, the possibilities for development increased. For example, the site of the old Madison Square Garden at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street, which had stood vacant for almost 20 years even though excluded from the Clinton Special District, became the subject in 1985 of a proposal from the Zeckendorf organization to build what is today World Wide Plaza. In typical Tammany style, the McManus association sought to have a certain number of housing units (agreed upon to be 148) set aside for low income people from the neighborhood and then supported the proposal. Although other more radical tenant groups opposed the development, the fact that the McManus Club, which had been in the community for almost 100 years, supported it essentially rendered this opposition in effective, and the project went forward. The same pattern was repeated with developments along the 42nd Street corridor, and along 57th Street, where the Sheffield was finished and opened.

Another thing I want to meditate on this week is a line from one of the praise songs we sang yesterday . The line reads ” there are so few words that never grow old , Jesus Jesus Jesus “. You know how when you repeat some words over and over again they lose meaning and start to sound really weird ? Try doing that with the name of Jesus . I don’t believe it would ever grow old or lose meaning . Because it’s ever so much more than a name . The name Jill , I’m sure , would not have the same outcome . Try it , reflect on it , and examine exactly what the name of Jesus means to you .

It was also an actual desert. Or at least a steppe climate.

Frankly speaking composting bin fits the place, but my modest persona can't :) if I want to do something there.
The photo was taken in Terre Haute, Indiana by Elsam 328 Main Street between 3d and 4th. I Googled Elsam and found in the 1900 census for Laconia, Belknap, New Hampshire an Edwin A. Elsam, photographer, born in Indiana in 1840, married to Mary Elsam birthplace New Hampshire, both age 60. I also found a marriage date for a Edwin Elsam, photographer, born in Bombay, India to William and Sarah (Hudson) Elsam, and his bride Mary Houghton, residence Laconia, NH in May 1889. Assuming this is the same person, he probably came from Indiana to New Hampshire before 1889 which would date this photo before that time, probably between 1860 and 1889. Whew!!

Our first afternoon there was a stiff breeze. Imagine the hot dry Karoo. You are a sparrow sized bird with short legs. There is water. In a pool, with a smooth concrete rim. The filter runs on a solar panel. Couldn’t bear to watch the birds battling to reach the water, so the Ungardener carefully chose and placed two rocks. Those little birds were delighted to be able to bathe. The solitary bees and the mud wasps were also desperate to get water, and hundreds of them lost their grip, to drift drowning on the water. We spent some time fishing them out.

Not knowing whether we'd be interviewing Levon for the camera this time round, I decided to come prepared by penning a few pages of questions to ask him. Most of these queries were answered in the book, but I had a few special, personally concocted questions thrown in there. I spent my nights in those hotel rooms reading and amassing my plans for when we got to sit down with Levon. It was incredibly exciting...the closer and closer we got to Woodstock, the more my adrenals were pumping away. I had met many celebrities before, but I had never been to one's house to interview them, so I was pretty keyed up. I didn't know Levon at that point, so I didn't know that all I needed to be was myself. Steve, meanwhile, wearing his multi-colored beret and holding a half-smoked cigar in hand, was cool as could be. It was difficult for me to read his emotions, which I guess was a feature that made him a bit more of a professional than me.

In the seventeenth century, the word menu was not in use in this country. The term that was in common usage was 'bill of fare'. However, at James's great feast, the long list of dishes was referred to as a 'catalogue'. Here is the full catalogue of the dishes on Sam's table from my copy of Sandford's book. A venison pasty is listed as item 144. I am not sure whether he got to sample it, but if he did, I hope its was sweeter and more toothsome than the one at Sir William Penn's 'that stunk like a devil.'

"Your article on the patent wars in the smart-phone market left out one key player: the consumer ("The great patent battle", October 23). The flourishing competition among mobile platforms, devices and applications directly benefits consumers. In contrast, exploiting vague software patents to try and block open-source innovation neither helps consumers nor promotes the development of new technologies.Innovation and competition, not ligitation, are the keys to providing the new generation of products and services that is changing the lives of billions of people around the globe."So what do we make of these comments? Let me suggest the following:
"The Rub" - unfortunately, the notice provides no guidance on what type of "showing" is needed to file a second or subsequent continuation. Is it sufficient to take a reissue-type approach by simply claiming that the applicant claimed less than he/she had a right to claim in the original application? What if you claimed that "subsequent to the Notice of Allowance, it has come to applicant's attention that certain types of products may be infringing the disclosure contained in application 10/999,999, but not literally claimed. Accordingly, applicant is submitting new claims that would encompass the potentially infringing products." Would that be sufficient?

What was simultaneously interesting by way of random archeological facts and somewhat boring by way of the flow of the book was the first half of this book. While it does lay a sort of frame work for the second half of the book, so much more time could and should have been dedicated to a discussion around some of the findings and their implications, socially, historically and religiously. The story does carry a sort of adventure feel to it which could have made for great fiction but detracted from the theological robustness of this book.
So, so true.
When I was a young reader the two kinds of books I most liked were science fiction, and the thrillers of Alistair McLean.
I know that quilting has always been popular, but not so much with young women - and it's young women who lead the way in cultural change, so the fact that so many young, hip, creative women are sewing and quilting is definitely something noteworthy.

As I say, those who follow Craig’s work on the Kalam will be able to guess his response. For years now, Craig has been harping on about the distinction between “causal priority” and “temporal priority”, as well as the possibility of timeless eternal intentions. Combining these two notions, Craig can say that God’s intention to create the universe may have existed eternally and may have causally preceded rather than temporally preceded the beginning of the universe.

Now I don't know if this is a real story. I also don't know who wrote the words to the Senior Edition of "Jesus Loves Me". Doing a search was no help either, so I will assume these words are Public Domain. If you know otherwise, please let me know and I will be happy to give credit where it is due.
However, even this quirk of nature hasn’t been able to hold back the tide of deterioration, and ever since that visit I’ve been struggling ever harder to read the small print on tins and packets of food. And when I’m that extra bit tired even the TV guide is starting to be held at arms length.
The second reason does have some appeal. While I have never had a class actually disrupted by someone’s choice of attire, it does seem possible for this to happen-provided that the clothing was such that it would create a significant and lasting impact on the class. In all my years of teaching, about the most extreme reactions I have seen is having some students stare briefly at another student because of his/her choice of clothing. This has sometimes been followed by some whispering. However, this sort of “disruption” is nothing compared with the disruptive influence of personal electronics and people talking to each other in class. Naturally, students coming to class partially or fully naked would probably have a significant impact-but that is already covered, I think, by existing laws regarding public nudity. Because of this, I have never really considered improper attire a threat to my classroom-but my experience might be unusual. There is also the possibility that I am blind to the damage it has been doing in my classes. If other professors’ classes (and mine) are, in fact, being disrupted by improper attire, then the code would make sense on this ground. After all, the disruption of class would harm the other students and thus warrant imposing on the liberty of the student whose attire is causing the disruption.

At this point, I didn't really want to go in the princess' room anymore as I was tired of hearing the demands and complaints (the foley, the nurse, the bed, the IV tubing, her family, I'm hungry, etc.). Hey, this is what happens when you opt for an epidural - certain things come along with that. We discussed this in the birth strategies class that I taught and she attended. Night shift came on and I got her a fabulous nurse. The princess was feeling pressure so I told the new nurse (Nurse Wonderful) that she could check her and start pushing....call me when the baby is looking at you. :p JK! She pushed very well (I figured she would - she had a great pelvis) and delivered a cutie over a small second degree laceration.

My momma's favorite color is red, so I grabbed Cherry Cobbler, since it most closely resembles the rubies she adores. Since the card needs to be mailable, the gorgeous 3D flower originally created as an embellishment had to be left off.

Art or Idiocy? was in Cleveland this past weekend and had a chance to visit two of the city’s art venues. First was the Cleveland Museum of Art, which is partially closed for a major renovation and addition. The project is more drastic and expansive than Chicago’s Art Institute. As a result, many galleries of it’s encyclopedic permanent collection have been closed and deinstalled, with the museum’s total closure for a temporary period coming later this year. But what is currently on view is amazing. The NEO show, akin to the Greater New York, and the extinct Chicago and Vicinity exhibitions, highlights contemporary work from northeast Ohio. Also there is an exhibition of meticulous works on paper by Belgian artist Michaël Borremans. It is his first museum show and the CMA venue is its only stop in America. Borremans’ Hallucination and Reality is quite the sleeper hit.
Since I slept in until about 9:00 I decided this would be a great morning to make some scones. They only take about 40 minutes total to make which is just enough time to sip some coffee. They’re about as difficult to make as pancakes, which isn’t too tough. I used my homemade strawberry jam in them because the recipe uses a cup of diced strawberries which is exactly what was in that jam. How handy. The first time I made this strawberry scone recipe a few weeks ago I was trying to impress the previously mentioned boyfriend with my domestic skills. I didn’t separate the individual scones on the baking sheet and they did not cook in the centers. I was mortified. He said it tasted like cookie dough and ate it anyway. Twice since then I’ve made them just to prove to myself that I could. This scone practice is fine with my son. He has eaten more scones from coffee shops around the country than most adults have. I was about to make a glaze to put on the top but there was no powdered sugar in the cabinet so I made honey butter instead. Later in the day I texted the boyfriend to tell him I had not messed up this batch. He was sad to have missed them.
Finally, Taylor, your apology, or lack thereof. I totally get that this was all a big shock, and you've put a lot into this company to have some angry-Native-people-who-can't-take-a-joke try and take that away. But your apology is pretty much a text book response to this type of thing, so much so that I almost laughed. Read this, if you don't believe me. We're not interpreting this as offensive, it is offensive. It's not honoring to have someone make a mockery of your culture, traditions, and spirituality. I don't find it respectful when someone makes light of the insurmountable loss of land and life from broken treaties, or basically tells me that I can't take a joke, when the joke is at the expense of my culture.

Overall, the Gippsland Organic Yoghurt is hands down a better choice. You are consuming much closer to the real product, with a mere 3 ingredients to create delicious and healthy yoghurt, and not a replica achieved by ‘modifications’. And the best part, for an organic product, it is still CHEAPER than the non-organic variety. A trait you do not find often in organic products!

Another thing that strikes one as counter-cultural here is the tolerance for smoking. Smoking! Among educated people in California, it’s hard to name a bigger sin than smoking, except perhaps the sin of intolerance (which is oddly permitted when it comes to smokers). Here at TAC some of the students do smoke, right out there in front of God and everybody, and no one bats an eye.

Clearly the KZN MEC has forgotten that he, of all people, should know that crime in South Africa is out of control and the very least the public expect from people in authority is that they set the example. What they do not accept, or tolerate, is that the person charged with ensuring that law and order is maintained show total disregard for it’s implementation and furnish grounds of justification, which have no basis in law. If he was late for a function where does that leave him in terms of breaking the law? As for “racism” and “lack of accountability”, Cele seems to be the master of both.

On Sunday morning I poured a cup of coffee and cracked the slender spine of Julian Barnes's 2011 Man Booker Prize-winner The Sense of An Ending. I read it in one sitting, and at a compact, piercing 160 pages, I'm sure I'm not alone; one is likely to gobble it up in one forkful if one cottons well to English schoolboy nostalgia, the vexations, yearnings and botched sexual encounters of the young, the pithy meditations on regret of the old, and the best eff-you letter to an ex-lover I've ever read in any work of fiction (page 104).
“Let The Right One In” is a vampire story, or it’s a coming-of-age story, or it’s a love story. Or it’s all three. It’s a story about abuse, and about friendship, and about fear and about freedom. It’s horrific and haunting and oddly sweet and beautiful. Whether you’ve seen one of the two recent adaptations of it, or whether you’ve never heard of it before… once you’ve read it, you’ll never forget it.
I generally don’t do a lot of sanding before I paint a piece. You want to make sure you do enough sanding that you have a good, smooth surface to start painting on, but if you’re using a good primer, I don’t think it’s necessary to sand your whole piece before priming and painting.

As those of you who have followed the evolution of my little Etsy fiber shop will know, this is an issue I’ve explored and reexplored since even before posting my first skeins of yarn. My recent post on Fehu in the Pagan Blog Project seems to have brought it to the forefront again. In that post, I talked about the fact that many pagans feel reluctant to spend their money on items crafted by strongly Christian artisans. I myself have no issues with doing so, but I respect the fact that many people do.

Him, me, and alot of people I know are in a weird spot that we’ve never been in our entire lives–a position of entire freedom. Barring money issues we could pretty much go anywhere or do anything we wanted. And that freedom is terrifying. We could wander down hopeless, winding paths for many years without realizing they aren’t getting us where we want to go. We could stumble into obstacles the likes of which we haven’t seen yet. Hell, for pretty much the first time, we could truly FUCK UP bad enough to ruin many years of our lives.
So was it a suicide prompted by Paul’s inability to come to grips with his newly-discovered sexuality? Or perhaps a lover’s tiff? Or was it something more sinister? The answer to any one of these questions would make an intriguing story, but to all this Lindquist has added the quest for closure when the loss of a family member might have been caused by suicide on account of his homosexuality.
Ladies beware, 21 Jump Street seems to be a dude comedy. With plenty of sick humor and male bonding to boot, the ladies of the audience will probably not get as excited as their male counterparts. However, with the handsome Channing Tatum factor, as well as a strong attempt at a love story between Doug (Jonah Hill) and Molly (Brie Larson), there is some appealing to the farer sex. However, the blew-em-up chase sequences and blatant “dick” humor will probably make the shier girl crowd cringe and wander off.

So the infected wandered the city at night, searching for people who had avoided the sickness and survived in the city. These survivors were essentially squatters, constantly moving from one location to another. Emerson’s two police stations had already been ransacked by these survivors and they had taken whatever they could to arm themselves for protection. The problem was, firing a gun would attract more of the infected to their site, as would fire or any other sort of noise.

Her boyfriend had dumped her for someone else, someone younger, a blond with a bigger chest. He was her world and in losing him, he had broken her. She’d snapped. She wasn’t even sure where the knife came from, but suddenly she had one in her hand. She wasn’t upset, nooo. She was happy for him. He had won someone “better.” Even though he broke her heart, tore it into pieces, and threw it in the fire, she was happy for him. She wanted him to go away. She made him go away. The knife sliced through his flesh as easily as scissors through paper.

Hymns remind me that I’m not the first Christian to walk a hard road and that I’m not the only Christian to walk a hard road. They were the first words I learned to be able to articulate what I desperately needed from God. They fully admit and reveal what is inside me while also affirming and reminding me of truth. In them, as I sing them, I feel connected to saints through the ages. It soothes my loneliness while giving me a place for my tears. Even in times of great joy, I continue to be blessed over and over, by their richness and brilliance.

Before Levi’s bone marrow biopsy was started, the doctor informed us that he had decided that Levi should undergo the fifth round of chemo. Despite the fact that we knew this was an option all along, it did bring to an abrupt end the “everything is normal” game we had been playing for the past several weeks. We weren’t excited to hear this news, but we’ll accept it as the direction we need to continue to move towards the victory in Levi’s battle. We are hoping to hear back some preliminary results from Levi’s tests tomorrow, and potentially we could hear the results from the MRD test by the end of the week. We shouldn’t have to start the fifth round until after the New Year, which means that we’ll get to spend Christmas and my week off of work next week as a family.

This is how it always works for me, putting these bits and pieces into my brain and letting it mix and stir. For me, it never works to go look at other people's stuff: that just makes me depressed. Because the things I love are things that aren't popular, I'm not going to see inspiration in shops or galleries. There I just see things that depress me in their predictability. Even artwear, even cool clothes--it just doesn't usually do much for me. I need the bits and pieces of stuff grabbed from here and over there and way up on that shelf, all disparate, all quirky. Dump all those in the pot, and let my brain play around with them.

For a moment the incident seemed to be little more than a scary mishap. The other Warmisham girl made her own way to the shore with a small group of spluttering but high-spirited children.

Several parents packed their own offspring and those they’d brought along into their cars and drove off.

There were two lanes going each direction and in the rear view mirror I observed flashing lights of the colors that indicated I needed to pull to the right and stop. Now, behind me was an SUV and there were two other vehicles in the lane to my left. As I slowed with blinker on and pulled to the right, the SUV behind me put on her left blinker and made the initial gesture of pulling to the left land – right in front of the police car.

Up front they do not really have a goal scorer that will get a lot of goals but they work hard and do a very good job for the team. Alan Connell and Paul Benson both have 12 goals this season and this does not seem high enough for a team that are going to be champions. Connell has got 10 of those goals in the league in 30 games. The undisclosed figure which is believed to be a six figure sum may not have quite been paid back yet but if he scores enough goals to keep the team in League 1 next year then the fans will be grateful. Paul Benson on the other hand has been a very good signing and 9 goals in 21 league games is impressive. I think he is a very good player and if given the opportunity I believe he will do well in League 1.

Jesus said to the man: Get up and take your mat and go home. Do you think the man was going to not do that? And so if Jesus says to you today, “My grace is free for the taking, my forgiveness is available; rise up, come back to life.” Do you think you will not do that? The man walked; will you? The only other option is to remain flat on our back, paralyzed, left to do nothing but beg. But Jesus offers grace; what else do we need?

Can we hope to have such meetings again where Christ is recognized as the One actually leading and teaching His people through one another? I believe we can if we painfully divest ourselves of so many of our traditional concepts of what it is to meet in His name rather than in the name of the usual “order of service.” But we must re-thing the entire enterprise through the revelation of scripture.
MyMr would probably be pleasantly surprised, but not gonna lie, I am a little shy. Yes, I said it, I am a little shy. Am I worried about it hurting? Sure. A little. But it will only hurt briefly. I am much more scared about having another woman looking at my chacha.
Philosophers from Plato onward have struggled to define what is true and come up with some way of understanding our sensations and experiences in a rational and intelligible way. In modern times we have access to more information than ever before. That deluge of information can be overwhelming, but this is the environment we live in today. As consumers and as participants in democracy it will be up to us to develop the habits and acumen to discern what is real from what are shadows on the wall.

All of these 3 aspects of autism demonstrably overlap with each other - for example, prosopagnosia and the notorious issues with "eye contact" (a bizarre phrase to me, with the image it conjures up of people's eyes actually touching each other...) are in the overlap between sensory processing and social communication, attention-deficit issues are very often an overlap between sensory processing and executive function, and difficulty with initiating conversation or other social interaction can be partly due to communication difficulties and partly due to inertia/executive function issues - but nonetheless i think most if not all widely-recognised aspects (or "symptoms" as the DSM types would doubtless say) of autism (that i can think of, anyway) fall into at least 1 of these 3 broad categories, or can be explained as an interaction between them.

parents so I canvassed their opinions to ascertain some of the worst, and most hurtful, comments that they have received. I have kept all the statements anonymous and have included some of the internal and external responses that my sources have made.
