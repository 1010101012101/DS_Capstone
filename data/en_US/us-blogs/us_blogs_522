“Little Mermaid” is an original Hans Christian Anderson tale published in 1837 .
Throughout the week, Disney offered a wide range of arts and crafts classes on traditional Hawaiian classes. Some free, some for a small fee. My favorite by far was one I almost missed. The day before our snorkeling trip, I discovered that Kuahiwi Lorenzo would be teaching traditional Hawaiian feather work at the same time we'd be out on the boat. But, he'd be doing a presentation at the artisan's corner later that day, after we were back. So I sought him out, and asked enough questions that he ended up offering to give me an impromptu feather working class. I hadn't realized, but in ancient Hawaii, bird catching was a special occupation, where they learned to trap the birds without injuring then. Once caught, they'd remove a few feathers from each bird, then release them so new feathers could grow.

The beauty of this world is shown in the guitar interplay of the Cavanagh brothers. For all the ridicule that their future career as 'Radiohead for metalheads' has brought them, their debut album finds them in perfect sync with each other. One guitar will start a voice and let it linger mid-way, only for the other channel's guitar to pick it up and give it conclusion and rest. This game between brothers touching and yes, harmonious and joyful. There is no death-lust in the mental image of two brothers playing their instruments together, reaching agreement. I have been enchanted by their conversation on their early material before and long since I could realize similar musicality in my own multi-part composition. Though the brothers here connote this record has come from common grief (a family loss is alluded to directly in the liner notes of the record via a commemoration) I hear in their guitar stereo compositions, joy and lust and desire for something beautiful.

At its outset, about a third of gun owners had more guns than the FCA allowed, so they were required to sell the guns or surrender them to the government. Section 137 of the FCA expressly promised that compensation would be paid to people who surrendered their excess guns—either because they had “too many,” or because they were enticed by one of the government’s voluntary gun surrender programs.

When referenda are passed that take rights away from a minority of citizens, we hear that it must be honored because we are a democracy based upon majority rule. But those majoritarians forget the other half of the democratic principle that guarantees inalienable rights to everyone, including minorities, regardless of what the majority wants. The drafters of our constitution added a Bill of Rights for that reason although it took a long time for that ideal to start to take hold and it generally has been the judiciary that has had to take on the mantle of defining and protecting minority rights.
The resolution also states that it important for stations to hire more women and minorities.

To conclude, Glasman has a good grasp of what is wrong with England. He has a comprehensive understanding of the realities and consequences of a lack of political representation and the subjugation of discussion about the English question. However, whilst we should be grateful for, and take up with vigour any opportunity to engage with the political hierarchy about the necessity of freedom and fairness for England, I struggle to see how these ends can be achieved through the medium of political parties that seek only re-election and mandates of vacuous ‘change’ above anything meaningful.
We are each responsible for the reality we create within and around us. If we are not happy, it is because we are creating unhappiness within ourselves. We are creating unhappiness through our attachments, aversions, expectations, fears and in general, through our inability to accept what life is offering to us.

4. The Fountain: This is another unusual and fabulous film by Aronofsky. It melds a medical drama with mystical and mythical elements, yet pulls it off brilliantly. Hugh Jackman, who plays a medical scientist in the film, is trying to find a cure for his terminally ill wife (Rachel Weisz) and works day in and day out in his lab waiting for a medical breakthrough. I am not a medical genius, but I believe it’s some sort of stem cell breakthrough he’s hoping to achieve, and that’s where the ‘tree of life’ in the film comes in as the mystical connection. There is some Mayan mythology stuff too, something which does not interest me much. The film is a good watch. Maybe, you’ll discover more nerdy inspirations.

I read a story about an Arctic wolf who had a litter of pups. At first, she kept them in a deep hole in the midst of some rocks. After some time she moved them from the den to another spot almost a mile away in some willows. She was hungry and went off hunting with the rest of the pack and left her pups hidden until she could return. Several hours passed and she came back to nurse her young, but she didn't go where they were. She and another adult wolf passed the spot where her pups were and headed back to the den. She laid down and waited. The other wolf with her rested for a moment and then trotted back to the willows where the hungry young wolves greeted her excitedly. For the next hour she used all kinds of methods to get the young pups to follow her to where their mother lay waiting. She tried leading them, but they wouldn't follow. She tried getting them excited by acting playful, but they wouldn't follow. Finally she stood in the direction of the mother wolf, looked over her shoulder at the pups and lifted one leg very slowly and took a step. She patiently walked this way until the pups began to fall into rank behind her. They followed until they came to one last obstacle that lay between them and their mother, a talus slope of uneven sharp rocks. Once again she does everything she can think of to get them across. She even tries to carry them, but their little hind ends would bump up against a rock and they would whelp and wrestle free until they were back to the edge. So, the wolf plants herself facing the mother who is just on the other side of the rocks on smooth ground waiting, and she lifts a paw and slowly takes a step forward across the rocky barrier. Eventually the pups follow her to their mother......all but one. One little pup is left. He is too scared to try and make it across, even though he knows his mother and milk for his hungry belly wait on the other side. His fear paralyzes him. The adult wolf comes back to him and sits with him for a bit and waits. Then she goes and grabs a bone left over from a caribou kill earlier that day. She swings the bone from side to side and growls a playful growl. The young scared pup runs over and grabs the other end and begins to tug and growl as well. They play like this for a while and the pup doesn't notice the adult wolf is all the while leading him towards the rocks and to his mother. As she backs up to the craggy slope, she raises the bone higher so that the young wolf can't see the rocks and he begins to jump up trying to grab the bone. She holds it so his vision is focused upward. It isn't long before they are across the spot that he was so afraid of and he sees his mother and runs quickly to her. The other adult wolf lays down and rests, her job done.

Because when we look at this team now, it’s got Wilpon written all over it. By that I mean, every time we see this lineup, every day that we see Ruben Tejada out there, we’ll always wonder why Jose Reyes really isn’t there, if it was truly a baseball decision or financial save-Fred’s-ass decision. (Despite whether you think the Reyes deal was a bad one, the fact a big market can’t keep this guy is beyond me.) We’ll wonder if David Wright will be a lifer. We’ll wonder if Jason Bay’s and Johan Santana’s heart clogging contract will have to be ridden out because of poor decisions made in the past and paying for it in the future by not having wiggle room. And I’ll always be pissed off that Chris Capuano wasn’t given $12 million for two years because they decided to stick with Mike Pelfrey when they should have cut his ass off the team (yeah, I said it).

I didn’t take many notes in May either other than May 24th I had all the guns but one, returned from the police who had confiscated them. I then had the task of finding someone to sell them all for me as I surely didn’t want to deal with strangers coming to my home, didn’t really know the value on each gun, etc. This caused me to search for receipts which Rob had quite the habit of getting rid of so I wouldn’t know what he’d spent. I did manage to find quite a few, but the man who I consigned with knew a lot and I just had to let it go and trust him.

I have completed 2 half marathons in the past 7 months, and feel pretty good about both of them. I feel as though I learned a lot about myself (such as: I like to run in the early morning, and be done with it for the day; I like activities that show results, i.e. PRs at races) and even more interesting, about my relationship with my bf. We started training last summer while living in two different cities 5 hours apart. Since then we have moved closer (1.5 hours), and continue to train separately during the week and occasionally together on the weekends.
The Census Bureau just reported that in 2009 the poverty rate for all Americans jumped to 14.3%, the highest rate since 1994. And the 43.6 million Americans that fit this category is highest number in 51 years. According to analysts from the Brookings Institution, poverty is expected to continue climbing, reaching a high of about 16%, over the next 10 years. If this holds true, another 10 million Americans – including 6 million children – will be in poverty by then (Source: CNNMoney).

American Muslims have also enjoyed the direct support of President Obama. In April, he traveled to Egypt where he told the Muslim world that America no longer considers itself a Christian nation. He later traveled to Turkey and announced that America was one of the largest Muslim nations in the world (despite the fact that 78% of Americans claim to be Christians but only 1% claim to be Muslims). Then in May, President Obama refused to invite Christian and Jewish leaders to the White House to participate in the National Day of Prayer (as former presidents have done), but in September, he did invite Muslim leaders to the White House for a special Muslim Ramadan celebration to commemorate Allah delivering the Koran to his prophet Mohammed.

As lullabies, stories, and wishes alike floated around the room, my mind wandered for a while. I wondered quietly to myself, what exactly do I look for when I listen to music? Is there a goal that I am trying to accomplish, or do I just listen because listening is what I know best? As an answer, goosebumps spread across my body as the final note of one of the songs rang in my ears. I listen because music evokes a feeling. It isn’t a feeling that I can describe, but it is a feeling that allows me to forget everything awful and think only of those things that are right and good. And with that realization, just as I do when my dear friend plays lullabies on his guitar for me, I lost myself for a long while in the sweet melodies and unexpected harmonies. Not even the applause could break my trance; it was a truly moving experience.

The beauty of this book is that in it the author shares invaluable spiritual truths and narratives in an easy to read and understand fashion to help us mature spiritually and to build us up in our faith. Also he provides us with different exercises to challenge us to stretch ourselves and our faith so that we might be more like the God that Jesus knows…and wants us to know and love. In his book the author tackles such practical issues as sleep and how important adequate sleep and rest are for our physical, emotional and spiritual health. In chapter 9 of the book, How To Make A Pickle, the author addresses the issue of slowing down so that we might be cured of a condition known as “hurry sickness” sharing with us the need for us to “ruthlessly eliminate hurry.”

I've been evaluating the project that I did at the prison - examining the feedback that I got from the men in the creative writng group as well as my own jotted-down throughts on the workshop as they happened.

I was fairly prescriptive about what 'Flash Fiction' meant, and what themes I wanted the men to address in their writing, and how I wanted them to interact with me and each other during the six workshop sessions I held in the prison.

There is an interesting moment where Arbuckle, witnessing a tramp harassing girlfriend Minta Durfee, mugs angrily and moves toward the camera until his face fills the frame in a giant close-up that is at once menacing and comical. There is also a closeup of Minta Durfee used in a reaction shot in the first reel, as well as a later close shot of an anxious Mack Swain cheering on the boxing match from his ringside seat. In fact, THE KNOCKOUT contains several moments where the framing suggests greater care than the average Keystone comedy of this period. Subtle but creative use of camera angles, and the use of medium shots to bring the audience a little closer to Arbuckle, serve as evidence of this. These little moments are crucial in establishing the connection between the clown and the audience; Chaplin clearly knew this, and used such moments sparingly throughout his career. While some critics have seen this as evidence of Chaplin’s lack of technique, it is rather a sophisticated use of such techniques by limiting their use, thereby increasing their effectiveness when used.

Hannah's husband is kidnapped while at sea, so she's alone when a high ranking Christian government official comes to her seeking aid for his laboring wife. Ignoring the pleas of her Rabbi to adhere to the laws, she agrees to help his wife in exchange for the ransom money needed to rescue her husband. Once the baby is born, Hannah is under threat of arrest for treating Christians and practicing witchcraft for using her birthing spoons, and she's protecting the baby she helped deliver from family members intent on doing it harm. She turns to her sister who left the Jewish Ghetto to become a courtesan and they disguise themselves as plague victims to evade arrest.

The link above will take you to the newest printing of the Jackson’s Trailblazers series… there are actually 5 novels included in each book (I believe there are 5 compilation books available). I highly recommend the Trailblazers series, and I’ve found the new books to be a cost-effective way to add to my collection.

Most significantly, however, the relative rarity of pipe-smoking in America is a telling sign of its current intellectual crisis. If the pipe epitomizes the intellectual way of life, then is it any surprise that it cannot be found where schools substitute politically correct ideology for real philosophy, or where the intelligentsia, instead of engaging in serious thought, pander to the latest activist fads? Is it any surprise that America’s most famous pipe-smoker in the last thirty years has been Hugh Hefner, pajama prophet of the trite philosophy of hedonism? No, the age of the pipe-smoker is as far from us as the day when philosophers will be kings and kings will philosophize, a sad reality to which the thick blue haze of non-pipe smoke is only too ready to attest.

Not for the first time, Google's position would appear to be idiosyncratic, because its business model focuses on making its Android software available to manfaucturers for free, and then garnering revenues through advertising activities by users of the smart-phones. As such, Google may be a less appropriate object for suit because, in the words of the article, Google "will be hard to pin down. Google does not earn any money with Android, which makes it difficult to calculate any potential damage awards and patent royalties" -- although, as also noted, Oracle has filed suit against Google regarding the use of Java by the Android system (for more on this lawsuit, see here and here .)

The dress, the hair, the beautiful alabaster skin (enhanced by just a little tiny pinch of arsenic each day), everything was set. The painting began in earnest. After much deliberation on the subject, Sargent painted the gorgeous woman in the dead black gown in profile, everything about her image, just perfect. Except for one little strap that seemed to fall daringly off her shoulder.

Always supposing that Fraser wants to make common cause with his ideological brethren elsewhere, a list of members of the International Democrat Union (the Blue International, so to speak) is a good starting point. Most of them go in for 'bah, me too, I'm a sheep' names like the National Party - Honduras and New Zealand or Conservative Party (bit of a non-starter that one) - Canada, Colombia, Norway and Nicaragua. However, things get a bit more interesting with Estonia's Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica and France's Union for a Popular Movement.

“I did once or twice, but not really. I mean, I was walking in the same direction. I had about an hour before the bus was going to leave again, and they seemed kind of up to something, so I was curious about them. They walked to a motel, met some people there, came out like fifteen minutes later, and got back on the bus again. I thought it was weird. A couple of times they got off the bus and the Cadillac picked them up and took them somewhere, then brought them back. One time they got in a van.”
Five ‘Fabulous’ out of the last 20 years of intermittent play going is probably more a reflection of how truly intermittent it has been in the past rather than the state of modern drama – and if I were Meatloaf I’m sure I could conjure up a song along the lines of “Five out of 20 years ain’t bad’ and I am more than happy to sit through numerous ‘Good Entertainment’ category plays in the hope of hitting another ‘Fabulous’

Following a screening of selected video chapters from the award winning Watershed Report, thought leaders will describe and defend “our phenomenal sustainability success story” from the point of view of 2062. What does it look like? How did we get here? With good humor, good science and audience participation, this free evening at Intiman Theatre promises to be provocative, informative and courageous. If 1962 ushered in the Space Age, then in what “Age” will we be living in the year 2062? What Age do we want to be living in?

But this isn't the story of co-option, of street energy being tamed and exploited by the industry. At every level of hip hop, from the precinct hoodlum, through the cottage industry small labels, right on up to the corporate empires of Def Jam and Cold Chillin', rappers are on the make, eyes on the main chance, looking to be promoted to the next tier of capitalism.
When broken down to three simple steps it looks pretty easy, right? Think about it this way. I treat my pencils something like...well...copics. :) I lay down a light even layer of color in each section, blend that smooth, then go back with a darker tone and scribble a bit into the lighter areas, blend that out. Repeat if I'm using a third, darker tone. I find that this style of coloring and blending gives me something that falls about half way between watercoloring and copics. Easy as 1, 2, 3! Let's take a closer look at each monster.

The live show we'll listen to at the corner of 9th and 14th is finished. I found an old unlabeled live show from approximately the time period and played the recording from the distance we were from the stage and at a similar respective volume, and recorded it onto this tape. Actually we'll be listening in on the performance kind of from a distance...since we'll be sitting outside on the sidewalk.

In later life, our local Kent boy read Inga Clendinnen's ‘Aztecs: An Interpretation’, and this began an interest and fascination with the Aztecs and Mesoamerican civilization. So intense was his interest in this subject, cajoled by his wife, he would go on to write four books of historical mystery novels, three of them published by St. Martin’s Press and Simon & Schuster.
There’s been plenty of nonsense written about initiation down through the years, but the basic concept is easy enough to grasp. The symbolic and ritual tools of magical practice can be used to set off the same set of reactions that allow a child, or for that matter a baby baboon, to stock its social self with the nonverbal and emotionally charged patterns of its social group. This is done in a careful and controlled way, with patterns that further the process of magical training, and the candidate—the person going through the initiation—is taught nonverbal signals that allow him or her to activate the new patterns when it’s time to use them, and deactivate them when it’s time to deal with the nonmagical world. In the short term, this makes it possible to practice magic without too much psychological strain; in the long term, the experience of shifting from one set of arbitrary social patterns and emotional charges to another teaches the reasoning mind to detach itself from the social self altogether, and think its own thoughts rather than those of its society.

I chose to read Jean Baudrillard’s Requiem for the Media. In this section Baudrillard discussed the opposition of consumers of media being both consumers and producers of the news and other things that we obtain from the media. In his article he elaborated on his idea that the media is in place only to serve a social function and that the communication medium (media) is the message. Baudrillard discussed that a better way to comprise on who produces what society consumes is joint production through genuine interaction.

Album opener “Plastic Shotgun” is an insanely complex song that will make your head spin. Night Sun has a bit more ELP in their sound than Lucifer’s Friend but are too heavy to be a full on prog rock band. “Got A Bone Of My Own” and “Slush Pan Man” are dead ringers for Death Walks Behind You-era Atomic Rooster outtakes. “Blind” has a nice jazzy groove to it similar to Deep Purple’s “Lazy” with some nice guitar work. Fast ones like “Crazy Woman” and “Nightmare” use the “Speed King” template to excellent effect.
The rich palate was succulent and textured with ripe plum, a lovely freshness of acidity and minerality balanced by firmer tannins, cherry flesh and cherry stone and black cherry fruit. An earthiness does show through, but the succulence dominates right now. Lovely acidity and supple tannins on the finish. Really elegant, great balance, nothing is over extracted. I like this very much indeed – 90/100 points.

I would take the kids to their classrooms, I would meet up with a friend for coffee in a café near school and have one of their amazing nutella croissants. I would then go to the Tuesday market 10 steps from my front door to buy large amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables, some mozzarella di bufala perhaps, maybe some olives from large overflowing buckets. I would then go home and have a few luxurious hours to cook something for my blog without any interference. I could even try something a little more complex and time consuming. I could take pictures in daylight, try to improve my technique. Then off to a sushi lunch with my friend and just a few more hours to get some things done in the house that I never get to do when the kids are running around. A quick trip to a neighborhood fabric store to pick up something to make with my daughter for her carnival costume and then off to pick up the kids early for once. The perfect day.
Every time my mom says this, I feel like I am raising monkeys that have been trapped in the zoo for a long time and are dying to get back to the jungle. Sort of the Madagascar characters which my kids enjoy watching. Perhaps they can relate or perhaps they just simply laugh easily. Not that we do not talk about serious stuff like school, saving money and staying healthy. Nor do they get undisciplined each time they cross the line, does not do their assigned tasks or act too smart for their age. Like any ordinary family, my kids and I go through with the same struggles and triumphs. Being a single parent and having 7 minions to raise is tough work to the 7th power. One will easily lose her sanity by just thinking what meal needs to be prepared that will fit the budget and look delectable still. Or by keeping yourself healthy while three of your kids have the flu, worst one of them is confined in the hospital. Or just by simply having the time to take a shower, comb your hair and grab a bite before you head for work. Crazy as it may sound but at times it would help if one remembers to breathe in between before getting caught up again and overwhelmed by this daily routine.
Go to the local grocery store. Take with you the closest thing you can find to a pre-school child. (A full-grown goat is an excellent choice). If you intend to have more than one child, then definitely take more than one goat. Buy your week's groceries without letting the goats out of your sight. Pay for everything the goat eats or destroys. Until you can easily accomplish this, do not even contemplate having children.

After our drinks we headed over to one of our favorite OKC restaurants, The Wedge Pizzeria. We had a flatbread appetizer, and a truffle shuffle pizza that had mushrooms and spinach on it. It was all excellent, but the thing I haven't been able to get out of my head was the oh so tasty, oh so fresh, oh so summery and divine peaches and prosciutto appetizer we also enjoyed. And then, I decided to make it at home. It is rather simple to make and would go well with many different dishes. Enjoy!

I deal among other things with myths about how the Greco-Roman cultural heritage is supposedly shared by both Europeans and Muslims. The fact is that Muslims rejected most of it, from wine and theater via sculpture and visual arts to Greek democracy and secular Roman law. The only aspect of the Classical heritage that proved more compatible with Islamic culture than with European Christian culture was slavery.

Cashmere scarves are expensive, since they are imported from abroad and are handmade. It really enhances a man’s personality. These are more worn during winter and can make a guy look really smart.

My favorite orchid lives in the bathroom, where it is continually bathed in humidity from the shower and from the spritzes I give it every time I go by. It is rewarding me by putting out a remarkable row of large blooms, white except for the magenta bit in the center, whatever that is called. The white parts, of course, are anything but white, and have suggestions in them of the entire spectrum, enhanced by a multitude of tiny diamond points that sparkle in the light. Our bathroom is not large, and the orchid takes up a good bit of the counter, so that we bump into it as we use the sink. But I can think of worse things than bumping into an orchid in full bloom when I go to wash my face.

It seems that more exhibitors this year are concerned about issues of sustainability, as well as presenting more sustainable seafood. This is obviously a very good thing, as protecting the bounty of the sea is a crucial issue. I feel more positive about matters when I see so many exhibitors who are similarly concerned. And if you want to learn more about sustainability, you can discuss the issues with various exhibitors as well as attend some of the sustainability seminars. It was also good to see they will have a seminar, Selling Diners on Sustainability, which will help restaurants sell more sustainable seafood.

As for the ‘backlash against violent extremism among Muslims in the UK’ – I simply haven’t seen it. No doubt, as a journalist, Burke can search for isolated pockets of backlash. He will find them. But this reminds me of the time that the British Government, again circa 2006 (when Burke says things were pretty bad) starting looking into Islamic extremism in the UK. What did it do? Well, for a start they brought in the services of the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), other Muslim ‘leaders’ and various ‘experts’. In turned out that many of these people also turned out to be extremists of various kinds. Burke’s Muslim ‘backlash’ against extremism still hasn’t produced a single Muslim march against Islamist violence. There hasn’t been a single march, of any kind, by an Muslim group against the indiscriminate bombing of Israelis, or British, American and European soldiers. And I think that there never will be. Not the least because ‘moderate’ intellectuals like Tariq Ramadam say that such extremist actions are mere ‘interventions’. If a rich and educated Muslim can say such a thing, then one must surely wonder what Muslims on the streets of Bradford think about these things.

Joe Dante has used his fondness for these bits of Americana to launch a website where he and his friends have gathered together a marvelous collection of trailers.

We can then safely assume that my ancestors were the first to return to their place of origin, namely the southern tip of Africa - we were there before the blacks. We were the first to have joined our original ancestors - the first back in the 'ancient country.' We went 'walkabout' with others and we were the first to return.
Which brings us to the pitch rods. Last year Harris introduced a new strategy. On previous hunts with him, he used two stout rods with large treble hooks. The muscle was there, but the casting range was limited and inaccurate. Plus, large three-pointed hooks slinging out of the boat made everyone a little antsy. So, last year he decided to bring a smaller rod with lighter line that cast farther. We were hunting open water, more or less, so we could quickly maneuver close to put more lines in him without much fear of the gator breaking us off. Worked twice in the night.

Okay, back to the story and how I came up with it. First, to set the stage, I need to share a little something with you about myself. Well, about my hubby and me, actually. We love zombie movies, from the George Romero gems to Shaun of the Dead and everything in between, including "Walking Dead," the new series on AMC. You just can't go wrong with a movie full of walking dead people, can you? Well, if you've ever seen a zombie movie (or even you haven't), then you know the creatures aren't the heroes of the film. I mean, how can they be, right? They're all dead and decayed and downright unattractive, not to mention pretty damn scary. Which was why you can imagine my surprise when my hubby suggested I write an erotic romance about a zombie hero. I was like, you're kidding, right? What woman in her right mind would fall in love with a dead guy? No way could that possibly work, or so I thought.

It's amazing just how much the average "classic rock" doofus, who claims undying devotion to the mid-sixties rock scene and can tell you just about every Beatle story that he's copped outta fortysome years of ROLLING STONE all dripping with peace and love ginchy goodness, pretty much knows NADA about the music scene which the Beatles were part of nor the groups who were also doing their Liverpudlian darndest to make a dent. Yeah, I know that rock 'n roll ain't supposed to be just another version of history class...you know, "on which date did Mick Jagger develop his first herpes sore" or something equally odious, but if an entire generation of flower children claimed such a devotion to the fab four then why weren't they more interested in learning about the other acts who were frequenting the Cavern Club and creating a similarly-minded ruckus in the same clime and to the same clientele? I'll tell you why...them kids wuz spoiled ignoramuses!

Welcome to my Space Station!!! I have for you step #5 of this
.... "Sometimes I pressed my ear to the door and heard distant comings and goings. The gist of events and conversations, uncertain threads and emissions of her and her brother's lives. Explosions of hoohas, pounded stairs, slammed doors, flushing cisterns, music. It was as if they were putting it on to fascinate and tease me. Listen here, Fred! What is this noise here? And that one?"...
In every market, there are two trajectories—the pace at which products and services improve and the pace at which customers can utilize the improvements.
Without income, but with a renewed belief in the otherworldly apparitions which haunt Manhattan, they put a new mortgage on Ray's childhood home and decide to go in business as the Ghost Busters, paranormal exterminators. Business is slow at first, but when a posh apartment lady, Dana (Sigourney Weaver), starts getting harassed by her refrigerator - which, incidentally, opens onto another dimensions where ancient Sumerian demi-gods chant, ZOOOL!, into the steamy flames - business positively booms! And if demonic possession, floating grubby green things and 8000-year-old pissed off deities wasn't enough, the Ghostbusters eventually get harassed by the Environmental Protection Agency, as represented by the snide skeptic, Walter Peck (William Atherton).

Thank you to all of you for visiting my blog and leaving me sweet comments! :)
I don’t remember who, but someone in my 1980s radio career once advised me to speak as if I were addressing only one person, not the whole audience. So, it’s not, “Hello everybody,” it’s, “Hello, you.”
The big event for the trip was to take Little Miss up the Banff Sulphur Mountain Gondola. The morning was clear, so we made our way to the top in a crazy, dangling, eerily quiet gondola pod and got to listen to Little Miss giggle, ooo, and aaahh the whole way. The views are amazing way up there and we were pleasantly surprised that the weather held and was not windy or blustery when we stepped out on the boardwalk at the top.
7- Uglies by Scott Westerfeld. This would make an amazing movie! Westerfeld sure knows how to world-build, and the book had a lot of adventure that would keep me riveted.
I haven't brought this movie yet and I'm wondering if anyone out has and if so,what do you think of it? This isn't the movie of course but it is a 19 minute trailer which was the extra's feature on the excellent (albeit for the highly annoying background music) Sex Pistol's DVD,Who Killed Bill?
Some Europeans have converted to Islam, but the media and education system-damaged girls who drink to excess, take hard drugs, are covered in tattoos which they display from their overly exposed flesh, have sex to be popular and not appear 'racist', tend to be used and abused and not considered of sufficient quality for marriage - which is understandable. Such girls do dilute the gene-pool of the indigenous population, but their behaviour leaves the Pakistani colonies intact, which doesn't serve the global agenda insofar as mongrelisation of all the Goy races is concerned.
The action/crime/biography Stander is my favorite Tom Jane performance. It features a lot of action, wit, and clever means of robbing banks while evading police. A definite 9/10.
We found this gorgeous morepork/ruru tea towel in MadeIt, a cute little boutique we stumbled upon in the city. I've had my eye on the artist that made the tea towel for awhile. It was nice to see her work in person.

Also, if you have been married more than one time and for 10 years or longer and meet the above criteria, you have 3 social security benefits to choose from! Yours, and your past 2 exes! So whichever is the highest, that is the one you take. But beware, social security will not freely give you this information or even ask you if you have been divorced.

I have never experienced a Tax-Free weekend before & let me say it's not very fun. I can't remember a time where I was running around so much. From one customer to the next, doing 10 things at the same time...insane! Why do people wait until the last minute to shop for school clothes? I mean, it's one thing to be out of town all summer but these people were coming in saying they were just here the past week or so. Why didn't you shop then? The entire store was 40% off & I bet you we had the sizes you were looking for! But no, you come in tax-free weekend when just about everything is regular priced & you get upset that we don't have your sizes. Sorry people, your mistake...not mine!
In the picture above, the black hose that was the real guilty party is back in its place. This piece of tubing draws water out of the washing machine and empties it down a drain. For whatever reason, the hose slipped free, fell to the ground, and began discharging H2O (also known as the extremely dangerous dihydrogen monoxide) all over the floor.
I get a 7am train into London, so the first thing I do when I get a seat is to check my emails and respond to anything that has come in overnight. We deal with lots of Australian publishers and other people not in our time zone – my emails are never at zero. After tackling the inbox, I usually read submissions or requested material for the rest of the journey in.
Combined, these 3 growing areas should provide us with all the herbs we favour, all the salad we can toss, all the spinach, beans, carrots, strawberries, rhubarb and asparagus we can eat.

Finally, Whybray’s article has nothing to do with the meaning of the word קנה, and instead simply argues that other texts from the ancient Near East do not provide a source for the poetics of Proverbs 8.

As our eyes glance over the world around us we are able to quickly grasp a 3-D image of our environment. But can we always trust what we see? Just as we have mental shortcuts, we also have visual shortcuts that help us quickly take in the world around us. Sometimes though, those shortcuts can lead us astray. And when they do, its entertaining. So for today's Friday Fun, I thought I'd share a few of the more famous visual illusions that I learned about in my Sensation and Perception class. Try them for yourselves and see if you fall prey to your visual system!

Olivia has just about had it with the popular kids at school. She and her friends have done nothing to deserve evil pranks and awful name-calling, but that doesn't stop queen bee Brynne from humiliating them on a daily basis. If only Olivia's classmates were more like the adorable dogs she helps her grandmother train--poorly behaved, but improvable. Wait...what if her tormentors' behavior actually could be modified using the same type of training that works on dogs? Olivia and her friends are desperate enough to give it a try. But is it really possible that the underdogs of Hubert C. Frost Middle School could make it to head of the pack?
M – oh! Wow. That’s…umm…that’s really forward.
The sheer curtains on the picture window were hung too low, so I kept them off until I find a better choice. I also started painting the breakfast room chairs. And by started, I mean I painted one. How about we have all kinds of fun and back waaaaay up...here's the kitchen when we moved in. Warning: cover your watch because this room is so homely it could stop time.
Tired of celebrating the preacher and ignoring the foster parents, the hospice workers, the carpenter, the faithful giver-in-secret, the teacher, the prophet-disguised-as-a-mother.
On-trend cobalt with heinous faux tan, on-trend coral with divine Grecian cleavage-bisecting braided silver straps, and the season's must-have, a maxi that has been gracefully hoiked up five times in four minutes over a too-tight strapless bra cowering beneath an onslaught of orange breasts. There may also have been fascinators. I choose to label it car-crash couture.
The man standing by the door is a veteran of our armed forces and was on my flight to Salt Lake City. He spent a number of minutes staring out the window, so I had to snap a shot. Oh, and in case you’re wondering about the umbrellas, stay tuned. I’ll have a separate post about them coming up soon.
I really liked Penny and I deeply felt for her. She had to deal with Danny, but also with their daughter. This is a child that hasn’t seen her mother in months and who’s used to her father, so when her mother comes she wants nothing to do with her. The infidelity hurts her but her daughter’s rejection devastates her. And she only has one week to figure out what to do about it all. Fortunately, she has the support of her in-laws, who love her and worry about her, and who make brief but remarkable secondary characters (maybe the brother will have his own book).
So, where had this imaginary fog come from? My first thought was to blame it on the sunshine. Hot weather always makes me tetchy, restless, and generally unproductive. While the rest of the country (apparently) was basking in our Indian summer- romping in the park, splashing around at the beach, relaxing in the garden - I was cursing the audacity of the sun for daring to shine in Autumn (or rather, shine so much). I'm not a big fan of heat, see. Don't get me wrong, I don't retreat indoors at the first sign of a ray of sunshine. I have been known to go to (and even enjoy) barbecues, sit in a nice beer garden (under an huge umbrella) with a glass or five of something chilled, or even venture to a park or beach. It's just that given the choice, I'm more a roaring fire and jumper kind of girl. Sunshine isn't even my preferred option in Summer, never mind Autumn - WHEN IT'S NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE SUNNY!

I’m from singing hymns beside my siblings in my Mary-Janes and fidgety lace, shaking hands with the minister, and feeling peaceful while my mama sang grace.
Alas, the day isn’t over yet, and either way, this has been an amazing vacation spent with a kindred spirit and I’ll be flying home tomorrow refreshed, and as ready as one can be to reenter the 9-5 life of a working stiff.

I guess they figure if they get totally smashed into the corner we won’t see them and pick them up. They absolutely hate to be picked up! I have spent hours just talking to them and reassuring them I won’t hurt anyone … I have picked each one up many times and all they want to do is escape. The Guinea book we have does say you have to play with them ALOT! It has been a week and they are not coming around to our friendship … at all!

What about the child who definitely understands the concept, but does poorly on the test because he forgot to show his work (because he didn't need to do any work to get the answer)? Or because he is sick? Or distracted because of some tragic situation going on in his life? Does that mean he does not know it?
After rounding off our first full day in Wuhan, we boarded a night train to Wudangshan where we encountered our passport debacle. A few days later, we would once again return to Wuhan well after the girls’ bed times, and a bit worse for the wear. Despite all this, a night’s rest in the same lovely hotel brought us another warm, sunny day in Wuhan. A nice place to close the book on this journey. We enjoyed a peaceful walk around the city, taking in the beautiful East Lake, and making our way back for our last meal of street food on our trip. Sure, the museum we wanted to see was closed (it was Monday), but the day was beautiful, the girls enjoyed some exercise equipment, much to the delight of the locals nearby. Our trip ended with an uneventful high-speed sleeper train back to Beijing. Our tour of central China complete, we were glad for a bit of rest before it all starts again when we head to Fujian and across the Straits to Taiwan.

The grimy guitar tone is heavily responsible, as it sounds like someone has hooked an IV up to your veins and pumped a city sewer system through your body. Or trying to floss your teeth with rusted barbed wire. The riffs cycle through streams of primitive tremolo patterns and bombastic chord sequences redolent of albums like Harmony Corruption, Utopia Banished, Mental Funeral, World Downfall, Realm of Chaos and Horrified. Drums maintain a laid back but aggressive stance in the mix, all raw and natural-like, and the bass feels like sentient, distorted ooze that escaped a tar pit one night and decided to stalk the living for their flesh. Vocalist Adam Scott has a broad, blunt guttural that brings back memories of the old British growlers, though they also hurl forth a more surgical snarl where it can amplify the aural destruction. As for the production, I doubt I'd have it any other way than the dry, brutal honestly implemented here, well suited to letting the vocals and instruments breed their own, morbid puerility.
To date there is one confirmed illness in Washington related to the recalled product. Other illnesses in Washington and Oregon may also be related.

Could I sneak out before it broke loose? It was passive when it was alone, but as soon as I entered, it started moving around again. These bathroom stalls were NOT going to keep me safe from a zombie.

I asked her how she came to live such an unconventional life.
But I'd also rather be in the waiting room at my doctor's office, you know, just in case. No, I won't disturb anyone, I'll just watch the fishes and gaze out the window, if that's all right. Maybe go down to the hospital cafeteria for lunch, since it's only three floors from the antepartum unit. Nice and close by, if it's needed.
In her book, Me And My Big Mouth, Joyce Meyer writes, “The source of most of your problems could be found within you—from the neck up. You’ll find it in the thoughts that come from your mind and the words that come out of your mouth.” Yesterday we saw that our words are important because according to James, they are like a bit in a horse’s mouth, directing our lives. This writer also gives us a second illustration that affirms this ideal. Look at James Chapter 3 and verses 3-4 in the Message…
And I will find my way home, out of his darkness
We headed off to a National Park, and let me just take this moment for a sidenote: my affection for the US National Park System can not be overstated. We once took a sixteen day family vacation, built around the National Parks, and it is something the kids still talk about, eight or ten years later. The topic of National Parks will definitely be revisited in more than one blog in the future.
but first I started with a blanket....an old soft baby blanket.
The merchants filled their ship with new merchandise and set sail for distant lands and, passing the island again, were welcomed by Tsaritsa Marfa and Tsarevitch Guidon, to whom they recounted their visit to Tsar Saltan. Nor did they fail to tell how he had purposed to sail thither until he had heard of the fir tree, the squirrel and the nuts of gold and emerald.
The reason behind keeping children rear-facing as long as possible, is to allow the seat to absorb the impact from a crash instead of their neck/spine. This is even more important for small children because their heads are huge in comparison to their bodies, and until the vertebrae begin to fuse (between ages 3-6), the spine can stretch farther than the spinal cord can. If an adult gets whiplash from a crash, imagine what would happen if our head weighed 50lbs, which comparable to how a toddler’s head/body is proportioned.
English Commentary: This just starts the movie, but with the commentary track (also available by selecting audio track 5 with your remote’s audio button). The insights here are provided by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski authors and experts on Japanese Cinema, especially Toho films. Anyone who has purchased any of Sony’s Toho Master Collection (Classic Media) will be familiar with them. Here, they stick to the film we’re watching, only going outside of it VERY briefly when talking about the cast’s other projects. This is a major improvement in their style, in my opinion. They also provide some fun background on the suits and props used as well as reasons for why certain things happened as they did, and even the fate of some of the props and sets.

Instead we get Robert Urich, giving his Burt Reynolds best as the swaggering Jason, a swashbuckling space pirate/captain/whatever heading up a bunch of fellow space-bound losers. Or in this case, an intergalactic Leo Gorcey to a whole spaceship full of Huntz Halls. Not that Robert did a bad job, and he makes a good leading man in a lightweight throwaway flick like this, but under the circumstances he could have put his talents to much better use... like starring in a different film.

THE NEXT BUS RADIO? BY JOSH GOLIN
While there were (and are) poor people in the South, the Appalachians were much more cosmopolitan than “Deliverance” wants you to believe, even in the frontier days. A community was made not only of tenant farmers, slaves, and migrant workers, but landowners, shopkeepers, railroad men, and professionals like doctors and lawyers. Even in the darkest hollows, there were mine owners and sawmill supervisors, engineers and dynamiters, school teachers, clergy, newspaper editors, and government officials. There’s a richer potential for story here, in the mingling of these varied people, than in wallowing in overplayed stereotypes.
“We are on the cusp of an epic shift,” wrote Jeremy Rifkin in his 2010 book The Empathic Civilization. “The Age of Reason is being eclipsed by the Age of Empathy.” He makes the case that as technology is increasingly connecting us to one another, we need to understand what the goal of all this connectivity is, and allow humanity to see itself as an extended family living in an interconnected world. The innovators I’ve listed, along with countless others, are the drivers of that worldview.

The fact that we were dating aside, I wanted to wait on the whole relationship thing. I didn't want a label. I didn't want to start college with a boyfriend.
Wullie's fist clenched involuntarily as he looked at Big Jim White's face and thought to himself - I would never get tired of slapping that. He forced down the forbidden impulse. Big Jim is kind and good, he told himself. Big Jim only wants what is best for Scottish football. Big Jim is not an arse.
As the fire burns; truth, justice, wisdom and innocence is shined upon, and all beings of the historic and ‘mythical’ past known in literature and legends such as Gods, Goddesses and Masters, get ready to fire their bow and arrow as a hallmark of the universal spiritual target about to be reached. I am captured by a symbolic vision of the sky turning to fire, the sun and solar flares having a sacred significance as our passion and heart-soul is ignited.
a. Jesus was raised by this same power, the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus was not resuscitated. No man who suffered crucifixion and died after six hours on the cross would be able to survive. We have records of people who were taken off of crosses before they died but even these people soon died from their suffering. The cross may have been a slow death but there was no death more certain. Jesus did not revive because of the coolness of the tomb. He was wrapped in linen with up to one hundred pounds of spices. There is no way that he could have been resuscitated. The power of God was necessary to raise Jesus from the dead.
It is dreadful to die of thirst in the sea. Must you then salt your truth so much that it can no longer—quench your thirst?

Now I’m willing to concede that this proposal would never gain widespread acceptance, so here’s my second solution: give the whole South China Sea to the least intimidating claimant for all concerned – The Republic of Morac-Songhrati-Meads.
Some Calvinists have agreed with Arminians that the group of people under discussion is truly saved. They even agree that that if someone who displays these attributes falls away they will be lost forever. However, the Calvinists who believe this also take the warning of the writer to be only hypothetical. To justify this belief these Calvinists draw upon the term “if” used in some translations. For example, the New King James renders this passage:

The occupation is so moribund that 69% of Americans chose “U.S. should not be involved in Afghanistan” in a survey. About half said Obama’s withdrawal timetable is too slow. When Newt Gingrich referred to the occupation as “very likely. . .a mission that we’re going to discover is not doable,” his Republican competitors did not even bother accusing him of “cutting and running.” As in the dying days of the Vietnam War, the leaders know they have lost but dare not admit it, so the slaughter drags on. That includes even President Obama, who secured the 2008 nomination on the basis of his supposed rejection of the Iraq war.
“Yeah,” she agreed as her feet alit. “Plus I can smell the sticky sweetness.”
The days that followed were filled with emotional highs and lows as I put my heart into a hodge-podgey, pieced together application and portfolio while I tried to allow my mind to shift toward accepting the possibilities hanging in the balance. Is this what I want? Is this where I should be? Am I ready to go? Can I do it? With little information and little certainty, I was hesitant to talk to anyone about it. I did counsel with the people closest to me, and thank goodness I did. They always know jsut how to get the tiniest bit of sanity into me when I'm the headless chicken running around. My best friend, Matt, asked how it all was going/if I had heard anything one night. I said I still didn't have much information but it did seem like Karen wanted me there, so at least there was that. He said, "Yeah, but do you want you there?" And that was it. That was the idea I had to hold onto. It was just exactly that simple. Did I want me there? Forget the personal pressures, the obvious inadequacies, the decisions beyond my control. When it all boiled down, I did want me there. And what a relief it was once that decision was made.
I have to mention Tod. My love for this boy has grown and grown with each book, and I'm sure it will continue to do so. He's just the most amazing, brave and selfless guy - and one of the funniest. He is just so completely wonderful, and I want one of my own. Sabine is still very much Sabine, and so I'm still loving her. That girl has serious spunk, and despite the way she can treat Kaylee sometimes, I love her for it. I am so looking forward to more of her. And I'm so glad I finally got an answer to a question I've been wondering about ever since reading the prequel novella, My Soul To Lose. Just shows how brilliantly talented Vincent is, If I Die is the fifth book in! She has had this book in head in some form since the very beginning. It blows me away.

First, we needed to have a body. Our Heavenly Parents had physical forms, but we did not. To become more like them, we needed to also have physical forms added to us, though these physical forms weren’t without down sides. The instincts, the nature of these bodies would have both good and bad qualities, which would need to be tempered and brought into submission with the laws set up God (our heavenly Parents). Giving in to some of these instincts would be a form of sin, with which we could not be in the presence of our God. To compensate for the inevitable sin by every child of God, a Savior was needed, and provided, in the meridian of time.
This past weekend your dad and I were lounging in bed with you, as is our practice on the weekends. We love having that lazy time together as a family, warm and cozy in our big bed. You were laying between the two of us and dad & I were talking together when suddenly you made a noise I’ve never heard come out of you before. We both stopped talking and looked at you. You looked back at me as if you say, “Ya mom, that’s right. That just happened!” The noise sounded distinctly like a fart, but it clearly came from your mouth. Your father and I being the pillar of immaturity that we are, we found it both heart-warming and HYSTERICAL! We were so proud.

03. Xandria - Save My Life
I have not been handling my personal life. I have not kept in touch with people, attended to the mail, made dinner, or kept the house clean. I come home at seven, grade or plan, eat whatever we can scrounge (unless B's parents have cooked a delicious, life saving meal) and crash on the couch. After three weeks, I feel like the deluge of work is lightening a touch and I may be able to tackle some of these things. Here's hoping.
I’ve been purchasing these magazines on and off for a little over a year, and I save every issue that I buy because I have gone back and referenced them many times.

She added the French court has yet to issue a subpoena for Abdul Razak as it has yet to finalise the list of witnesses, and that the former could choose to defy the court order and not fall foul of action by the French authorities.
After a short coffee break, we came back to the table, thinking about what we just learned from the battle. I rapidly accepted the fact that bow fire was useless, and now even more that I was going to play with the orcs. Gabriel didn´t believe that from the start, so he started slow, but finally accepted it too.
Assistance Dog Guide (AADG) named Argo joined our family to help our little boy, Noah, the youngest of our four kids, who had Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Someone on Google+ took offence (or did he?) and posted (or did he?) this comment:
But see again a like fulfilment in the case of those who mount up by faith to the friendship of our Saviour Christ. They also heard the words Get thee out of thy country. And that they did it eagerly we may learn from what they say: For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after the city which is to come, whose builder and maker is God. For they are strangers and sojourners upon earth, being citizens of heaven and leaving the land of their birth to speak allegorically of their heavenward aspirations, desiring eagerly the resting-place above. For this the Saviour set before them when He said, I go and will prepare a place for you; and when I come, I will receive you with Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. They were told |406 to go forth from their kindred; and how shall we show this? We will refer to Christ’s own words: He that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And that the things of God were preferred to their earthly and fleshly relationship, and their love towards Christ set forth as far stronger, is certainly unquestioned among those who reverence Him. And the blessed Abraham was ordered to bring to God his own son for an odour of a sweet-smelling savour, while others, girding themselves with the righteousness that is by faith, were commanded to offer not others but themselves. For he says: Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. Since it has been written concerning them: They that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof, they knew the mystery that is in Christ. For they know the powers of the age to come, and what will be in the last days; for they will receive the rewards of their labours, and take as requital the recompence of their piety towards Christ. Therefore we shall become just and the friends of God, as did Abraham. And the Gospel dispensation is far more ancient than that of the Law. I mean by the Gospel dispensation that which is by faith and friendship towards God, then moulded first in Abraham, as in the beginning of his race according to the flesh, that is of Israel, but now coming as from a type to truth, and being well fulfilled in the holy disciples themselves, as in the beginning of a spiritual race preserved as a people for God’s own possession, which also is called a holy nation and a royal priesthood. Therefore it has been said to the mother of the Jews, I mean the synagogue, by the voice of the Psalmist: Instead of fathers thy sons have been born.
Lake Views: The lake gets significantly wider the further you hike on the Townsend Trail so the views also change subtly in character as you go. When you reach the power lines at about 1.5 miles, step out onto the point to find a sandy beach that goes for 50 yards or more. The view includes the bridge on Yanceyville Road. Another prime lake view is at the 2.3-mile mark. This vantage point shows Lake Townsend at its widest. From there, you can see the remains of an old duck blind on a spit of land that appears to be a favorite roosting spot for passing birds.
Suddenly the bare branches outside my office window are bursting with green crepe paper leaves, springing down under the weight of a black squirrel leaping off the fort’s wall and down the limb, startling me from the daze of rainy midday. At home, the woods behind our house approaches, the trees full and verdant in their new leaves and blossoms. The robins hop and watch us, and we watch them, and feel thankful for the trees and the quiet.

You have probably heard the common expression, “So-and-so really gets my goat!” We use it when we talk about someone who has a way of provoking us.
There are currently about 1.7 million home care workers in the country. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 2.5 million by 2018. That’s an awful lot of hard-working people to leave at risk of poverty.

Misanthropic gameshow champion Chase Windborn wins an all-expense-paid tour of Entropia for himself and one of his foreign pen pals. Welder and frustrated artist Natalie Machackova is Ernie's choice. And if Chase chooses to stay home with his stamps, he'll forfeit a half-million of his winnings.
The Tramp gets a job maintaining the very machines that once fed him through their gears. His superior, an old mechanic, becomes trapped in one of the largest machines, with only his head sticking out. The Tramp moves to save him, then breaks for lunch. Frighteningly, the mechanic doesn’t ask him to stop eating—he just asks him to bring the mechanic’s own lunch over and feed it to him. Break over, they go on strike and the plant closes.
I so nearly didn’t attempt this loaf, unsure how it would reproduce gluten free, as so far my bread based gluten free baking has been a bit hit and miss. I’m so pleased I decided to take the plunge and make this bread. It was absolutely fabulous and that moment of slicing into the loaf and revealing the swirls tucked away inside was one of pure delight. I was dancing round the kitchen in such a good mood – It worked!
Little porky Anny opted not to chill out as a human being and stop taking things so seriously, going down the road of getting his pound of flesh while in the process convincing himself that his cause is just. You see my fellow pursuers of a harmonious zen state, there is knowledge and there is passion. Both equally dualistic. You can know everything in the world but without passion you will never be able to understand what you know. On the other side you can be passionate with ignorance at which point passion becomes what I phrase anti-passion. Anti-passion and passion are easy to discern from one another. Passion, which is infused with properly perceived knowledge always moves in the direction of freedom, peace and allowance of other human beings. Anti-passion however, always moves in the direction of bringing about peace through intolerant force. That’s the current leadership of the party, and that’s this guy. No doubt he dabbled in a few debate classes and all his friends are careful to avoid topics he might could turn into an argument because they’re sick of hearing him try to impress them with his anti-passionate rhetoric. Never works though because when he’s sitting at the huddle house sipping on a lemon water and he sees his friend pour ketchup on his scrambled eggs he just has to jump in his lap about it by bloviating on why its socially, economically, philosophically and theologically unacceptable to do so in public. Sheesh.

As a society, we have become so dependent on material things for our happiness that our lives would become completely disrupted without them. When things are on shaky ground, we pray to God to protect what we have. We reach out to God and expect Him to keep things as they are or fix them and make everything all right. God becomes our plumber who's supposed to fix things when they go wrong. This need-based spirituality is all right, but it's a bit superficial.

I don't know if these two examples justly represent a "common white tendency" (can you think of others?). However, they do help to explain why such an overwhelming percentage of Libertarians are white, and also why a lot of them -- although they'd never admit it in public -- are flatout racists. As Niky Ring writes (in a post entitled "Libertarianism: the ideology of American racists"), "Why are people shocked when a libertarian flips over and there's a Klansman on the other side?"

While being generally helpful, my friend's main concern was that he was under the impression that he wasn't supposed to tell anyone that he was one of the judges, having signed a piece of paper seven or eight years ago when first invited to take part, agreeing not to nominate anyone with whom he has a business relationship and also not - he thought - to broadcast the fact that he's on the panel.

The IPKat's friend Stephanie Bodoni tells him that the battle over control over the use of the word WATERFORD (see IPKat post here) is to be fought at a higher level, now that Waterford Crystal, the Irish maker of luxury glassware and china, is appealing to the European Court of Justice against the application by Assembled Investment Ltd (a South African winemaker)to register as a a Community trade mark the words WATERFORD STELLENBOSCH. Says Stephanie: "The crystal maker, a unit of Waterford Wedgwood, has appealed against the decision of the Court of First Instance (CFI) in June that Assembled Investment Ltd's use of the word WATERFORD for wine and other alcohol was not likely to cause confusion among consumers". This particular battle is also being fought in Ireland (where Waterford is the name of a local town) and the US. The CFI's view is that, since articles of glassware and wine are not similar goods, there is no likelihood of confusion. This decision reversed that of the Board of Appeal in 2004, which held that a likelihood of confusion existed, citing a high degree of similarity between the marks which can facilitate a finding of likelihood of confusion even where the parties' goods are not very similar at all. The Board of Appeal's decision had overturned that of the Opposition Division - which felt, as the CFI did, that there was insufficient similarity of goods.

By the 28th of November I had 6 mittens done. And realizing that my time to work on knitting mittens was exactly 45 minutes to an hour after I get home from working the evening shift and before nodding off at night - that meant that I needed to produce at least 9 mittens each of the remaining nights, and at the speed of roughly 7 minutes per mitten (and I'm rounding up with my time here).
- It is the year-on-year CPI, not month-on-month CPI. The y-o-y CPI can peak at 21 percent in August and then slowly ease to 19 percent at the year’s end. A figure lower than 19 percent is almost impossible, mathematically speaking. Even in my opinion, the 19 percent level is still too low actually. For Vietnam dong, I think we must increase the reserve ratio as soon as possible.

He asked me what it would sound like and decided it would have an Australian accent. This was later changed to a cockney accent. He asked me what I would name the company and I started repeating…Geico the Gecko. The mascot lizard would be named “Martin” for Charlie Sheen’s dad.

God gave me a voice. He’s given me melodies to sing, lyrics to inspire and a heart that is willing and ready to share with others. I can sing. I am a singer. I have a God-given gift of song. Writing music is a huge part of that gift, but singing it and connecting to it and to others through it and to God through it and connecting others to God through it, that’s my gift. I know now that God has given me this gift and he’s given me amazing opportunities to use it. I am going to believe in Him. Believe in His plan, and the hope and future He has for me and my family.

PAUL: But I went — I went into the Air Force in 1962 and studied aerospace medicine. Actually had a daydream about maybe becoming the first physician to go into space. That — that didn’t occur, but I see space — the amount of money we spend on space, the only part that I would vote for is for national defense purposes. Not to explore the moon and go to Mars. I think that’s fantastic. That’s — I love those ideas. But I also don’t like the idea of building government business partnerships. If we had a healthy economy and had more Bill Gateses and more Warren Buffetts, the money would be there. It should be privatized, and the people who work in the industry, if you had that, there would be jobs in aerospace.

I'm tired of latte liberals and journalists, who would never wear the uniform of the Republic themselves, or let their entitlement-handicapped kids near a recruiting station, trashing our military. They and their kids can sit at home, never having to make split-second decisions under life and death circumstances, and bad mouth better people than themselves. Do bad things happen in war? You bet. Do our troops sometimes misbehave? Sure. Does this compare with the atrocities that were the policy of our enemies for the last fifty years and still are? Not even close. So here's the deal. I'll let myself be subjected to all the humiliation and abuse that was heaped on terrorists at Abu Ghraib or Gitmo, and the critics can let themselves be subject to captivity by the Muslims, who tortured and beheaded Daniel Pearl in Pakistan, or the Muslims who tortured and murdered Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon, or the Muslims who ran the blood-spattered Al Qaeda torture rooms our troops found in Iraq, or the Muslims who cut off the heads of schoolgirls in Indonesia, because the girls were Christian. Then we'll compare notes. British and American soldiers are the only troops in history that civilians came to for help and handouts, instead of hiding from in fear.

I won’t open up the whole Charlton Athletic Pandora’s box here, but it raises more questions than it answers, notably whether we need it and can cope with it from an infrastructure point of view. Finally the very open comment that Eltham car parks will be the “revenue generator(s)” could kill the development of Eltham before it starts. Of course we want more pedestrian, public transport and cycling access but to penalize the motorist (and therefore families, the elderly, and the disabled amongst them) is asking for trouble.

The name Leonardo Da Vinci is so well known that we give it little thought beyond the fact that he was a remarkable figure in history. Indeed, we may not even know what his contributions were! Stefan Klein has corrected that with Leonardo’s Legacy: How Da Vinci Reimagined the World, now in paperback ($16.00, Da Capo Press). A painter, sculptor, scientists, inventor, and writer, his discoveries changed history. With each chapter, another invention and another facet of Da Vinci’s endless imagination are explored. Klein is a leading European science writer and anyone with a love of history and science will quickly find themselves drawn into a distant time in which this giant intellect and talent transformed the world in ways we still experience today. As noted last month, Paul Johnson has written Socrates: A Man for Our Times ($25.95, Viking), now officially on sale. Johnson is a noted historian and he brings the Greek philosopher and the times in which he lived to life. It’s a visit to the fifth century B.C. and the life of a man whose thoughts helped shape our actions and our understanding of the body and soul. The author has taken an ancient, iconic figure and made of him a living, breathing individual, albeit and intellectual giant. All of Western civilization is indebted to him.

Gods and Monsters (1998) – If you have been paying attention to this humble little movie blog the past month or two you will have certainly by now noticed that I have a certain fondness for the old Universal Horror films, chief among them Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. To me (and to many others, I can’t really claim this as my original idea) the most sympathetic character is the Monster. Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein were about the outsider. The man who made those two films, James Whale, knew a thing or two about being an outsider. He had been a cultured young man in a working class family in Britain (a country that is very insistent upon class). Furthermore he was a homosexual. Granted, Hollywood was reasonably tolerant of such things provided one was… discreet, but Whale had a life before Hollywood that much have been difficult. Author Christopher Bram wrote a fictionalized account of the last days of Whale’s life called Father of Frankenstein. Writer/director Bill Condon adapted into this film, taking the title from a line in Bride of Frankenstein: “To a new world of gods and monsters!”

Once a month at an upscale restaurant downtown, this group of mostly elderly men, meet in a private room adorned with scantly clad Greek and Roman goddesses. They sat at white-linened tables, sipped wine, and listened to guest speaker Christo Burger talk about the threat of Islam, the biased media, the Antichrist, and God’s special plan for the Boer nation. His business card describes him as President of the CIA (Christian Intelligence Agency), “Spreading Absolute Truth.”

Consider the needs of our Volunteer Fire Companies. We are losing volunteers at a rate that could lead to the demise of this essential community protection that neighbors provide for each other.

The concept that has remained with me is related to what happens when a child goes through various stages while growing up. In the beginning, for a child, everything done by parents is right. The child learns from parents and parents have all the answers for their kids. At some point though, the child will realize that parents do not have all the answers and it is not necessary that they are always right. That moment in child’s life can be very difficult because one most important pillar of his own thoughts and values is broken at that time. At that stage, the child is most vulnerable because he or she starts looking out for some other inspiration or hero in life and depending upon who becomes the hero, the life of child can take a different turn. Before I read the book, I had never looked at this idea but after reading it in the book, it seems so natural.

Were we to be told by God all that He wants of us in our lives, we would have fairly good knowledge of the future, which would be highly detrimental. We would have much less burden for prayer.

After the roast’s initial 30 minute cooking period, remove from oven and pile the apple topping on top of the roast. Return to oven (make sure there’s still water in the base of the pan!) and cook until the center of the roast reaches 160° . Generally, this takes about 40 minutes per pound, but I’ve found that using this topping makes the roast cook a bit slower. We’re also cooking this at a slightly lower temperature, to let the apple flavoring soak into the meat. If you’re shorter on time, a good guideline is 350° and 30 minutes per pound. Let roast stand for 10 minutes before carving (it allows the meat to firm up to make slicing easier).

Using a large knife, slice cauliflower into four 1/2" "steaks" from center of cauliflower (some florets will break loose; reserve). Finely chop enough loose florets to measure 1/2 cup. Transfer chopped florets to a small bowl and mix with olives, sun dried tomatoes, 1 tablespoon oil, parsley, and lemon juice. Season relish with salt and pepper.

My ultimate goal for 2012 is to work out more times than I did in 2011, and now that the year is one-quarter gone (shocking, huh?), I went back and calculated that in the first quarter of 2011, I worked out 75 out of 90 days (83.3%) – so I’m reaching my goal (by two-tenths of a percentage point)! Woo-hoo!

One of my favorite movies of all time is Cast Away starring Tom Hanks. Hanks’ character, named “Chuck,” is on the verge of proposing to his girlfriend Kelly, the love of his life. But he has to take a business trip first. Over the Pacific Ocean, his plane goes down. He survives the next four years completely alone on a deserted island. Finally, he is rescued. But four years with no word is a long time. When he returns, he finds that everyone had given up on him, and considered him dead. Even his true love Kelly, had mourned him, and then moved on. She is now married, with a toddler.

I once had the misfortune of working with a highly unpleasant misogynist called ‘Scoffer’ - a combination of his surname ‘Scoffield’ and the eating habits that had resulted in him becoming almost perfectly spherical. When in his late forties he suffered an epic fatal heart-attack (which presumably was the objective of eating six meals a day) a number of the psychologically abused women spread a rumour round the office that a vending machine had fallen on him.

I’m modern, independent, self-determining. Or am I? Quite often since the breakup I have had keen moments of realizing that I remain imbued with Gary’s tastes and opinions. We had similar tastes, in many ways, to begin with. We both liked Bernadette Mayer, Clark Coolidge, Arabic music and Indian food even before we met. And in the marriage our tastes blended into each other more: he came to like Japanese food and Alan Davies, I to enjoy graphic novels and Jack Smith. There were divergences. I would never, for example, really warm up to DA Levy or Paul Blackburn (they were both just too “guy” for me), and he never really got into my predilection for long colorful scarves (which he said made me look like Anne Waldman) or chinoiserie in interior decoration, but still, by the end of the marriage, he was wearing a lot of purple, and in his own way, by the end, he exceeded me

Many of the breweries at the Festival are available at bars and pubs around town, so it wasn’t all new to the beer-lovers in our group. But there were smaller breweries that are up and comers. Mile Marker is a brewery in St. Augustine we never heard about and fully intend to visit on our next road trip. Not only were their brews intriguing and the team behind the table friendly, come on… it’s like an hour’s drive away. How could you not? Each of their offerings at the Festival were tasty.

It has been a really low key day in the house. Yesterday we went swimming at a friends house and had a fantastic time. I managed to sunscreen the kids and my face but forgot the rest of myself. We stayed in the pool during a torrential downpour, had lunch and swam some more. Today I am quite crispy. I am fairly certain I have not had a sunburn like this in years. To the store I go to get SPF 70.
The dives that day were great – rather than try and get from point A to point B – the usual objective of a dive – Kath was content to just find one area with great marine life and let us swim around there for an hour. It’s not how I would choose to spend every dive, but it was a nice change. I’m definitely not doing these dives justice – we were seeing turtles, reef sharks, moray eels, schools of smaller fish, shrimps, lobsters and the occasional octopus. With only Kath and each other to keep track of, it was very relaxed but filled with great sightings.

It’s them and their cronies that are behind this global expansionism. They’re a private, for profit, off-the-shelf, regime-change industry. They fight the wars, organise the occupation that follows, rebuild the ruined infrastructure, recruit new governments, and manage the post-war economy.

Boredom lies at the heart of why marriages grow stale and partners cheat on one another and often seek divorce. Sex with the same partner reflects Prof. Toohey’s identification of predictability and, to an extent, confinement. So boredom carries with it some real challenges for any society.

A book intended for those going to India, but fascinating for those who, like me, had family serving in the Indian Army and Civil Service in the early twentieth century, is Flora Steel and Grace Gardiner’s The Complete Indian Housekeeper and Cook of 1890. Based on their experience of living in India for over twenty years, it was intended as a Mrs Beeton for Englishwomen in India, aimed at newly married women who arrive in India with little experience of running a household in Britain, let alone in an exotic far-away country. It is far more than a cookery book – the first part contains advice on every aspect of life in India, beginning with coping with native servants. Contrary to popular views on the linguistic laziness of the English abroad, the authors urge the reader as a priority to learn to speak Hindustani. They explain Indian weights and measures and give the names for common items which a well equipped storeroom should contain. They advise on wages and the duties of different types of servants, which vary depending on where you are. (Bombay was clearly the most expensive place to live.)
He held the entrance doors to the building open for her and she squeezed close to him, even though there was enough room between the double doors. But she couldn’t resist the chance to make bodily contact or get a whiff of his cologne. Warm, spicy musk tingled in her nostrils exciting her senses and she almost stopped to press her nose against his chest but the feel of his hand settling into the small of her back gave her an even warmer sensation. She leaned into his hand as he pushed her forward guiding her out into the early afternoon sunshine.

Yes you read that right and I am talking about myself! The fading ups and the lingering dreaded downs of the pain pills consumed me and I had to ask for help. I went to a mental hospital- the one that my son has been to- and they sent me to the ER to get medically cleared with the assumption I was returning. That didn't happen. it was determined that I needed a medical detox from the pain pills, so off to a detox program I was sent. I thank God it was a nice one and they kept me pretty comfortable. I was started on subutex 24 hours after my last dose of narcotics and for 3 days they checked my vitals and asked a lot of other quesions, which determined if I was in need of more subutex. After 10 days, I was discharged on suboxone. (Subutex has only the active ingredient of suboxone, minus the extra one that deters abuse.) I could not go on to the inpatient mental hospital like I wanted because they cannot facilitate the suboxone.

At that time, I looked up—way up, the guy was about 6’9″ and looked like a former lineman for LSU—into the face of this guy who just said, “I ain’t got no f%$#ing papers and you are going to give me my f%$#ing paycheck or you will be f%$#ing gator food,” to which I replied “yes sir,” handed him the check, finished the shift and went to the bathroom and threw up. I looked over my shoulder for the rest of that trip, not certain he would not finish me off for threatening to not pay him.

When Craig said that Fyne Ales’ Davarra had been too bitter for him, I knew I was in for a treat. Davarra is the first of a three-part IPA project, coming in both pale and dark versions. The dark one is the same beer coloured with malt extract. I had planned to try both, but after drinking the pale one I couldn’t imagine how the dark one could possibly be any better. Another terrific beer with satisfying, long-lasting bitterness, perhaps a little on the sweet side but then maybe it's nice to have something to chew on between sips.

About 45 minutes later, the same man returns to the convenience store -- this time to purchase a drink. But when the clerk opens the cash register to make the transaction, the bandit quickly makes a grab at the drawer and takes some money. Although the bandit got away, authorities have a good look at him -- thanks to the store's surveillance cameras. "This guy is very identifiable... numerous tattoos on both arms," Keller said. Anyone with information in this larceny case is encouraged to contact the South Salt Lake Police Department. "Probably the most humorous part is when he squats down and tries to lift [the ATM] with his back," Keller added. "We don't get many of these."
More importantly, he added, its governing board was unanimously in support of the initiative – ‘not in a soft way… they are firmly committed’.

The game also looks really charming. The sprites are cute and the idea of moving between foreground, midground, and background using the 3DS’ stereoscopic 3D ability is not only neat aesthetically, it makes playing the game quite interesting too. All in all, this demo really sold the game to me and I plan on picking it up when I have less things to play. Did anyone else try the demo as well? How did you like it?

If you place a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will immediately try to scramble out. (This is like the initial reaction when the first few of the eleven started falling down- many jumped out of ISKCON). But if you place the frog in room temperature water, and don’t scare him, he will stay put. Now if the pot sits on a heat source, and if you gradually turn up the temperature, something very interesting happens. As the temperature rises from 70 to 80 degrees, the frog will do nothing. As the temperature gradually increases, the frog will become groggier and groggier, until he is unable to climb out of the pot. Though there is nothing restraining him, the frog will just sit there. This is because the frog’s internal apparatus is geared to sudden changes, not to slow gradual changes.

‘The dark ages’ is how Lalit Kalra describes the state of stroke care before the past three decades. Patients were abandoned at the back of hospital wards. Little was known about the condition and treatment essentially involved bed rest. Close to one-third of patients died within a month and half died within a year.

There would be no white mobs in the street chanting “No justice, no peace!” There would be no whites holding a “million hoodie march” in New York City. There would be no white equivalent of Al Sharpton, the professional race-baiter behind the 1987 Tawana Brawley hoax, leading marches in the streets of the shooter’s hometown. There would be no Federal civil rights investigation by the Justice Department. There would be no comments from a president who seems congenitally unable to keep his mouth shut on matters involving left-wing political correctness. And there would be no national media attention from biased, left-wing “reporters.”
Although some of these sentiments are often serious and even beautiful, you will also find some to be a little quirky and humorous. This new series is meant to be a mix and match collection where all the elements are made to work well together. This collection is one that I will continue to add to and the series will contain individual character designs, coordinated mini backgrounds, mini borders, inspirational affirmations and humorous sentiments as well as elements which can be used to embellish your projects.
However, poor mothers are actively resisting this model, as well as the stigmatized identity attached to it. There is another model of mothering that some poor mothers have created for themselves. This model is called the, “mother as provider,” model and dictates that any job won’t do if it does not pay a livable wage. These women are resisting the state sanctioned, “work first,” model and are instead fighting to get the education needed to properly provide as a head of household. Currently, a state does not have to support a University education, and many recipients who attend higher education must also fulfill compulsory work requirements, as well as the unpaid labor that is parenting.
I decided to take a simple approach at looking at the effect of ENSO. Using GISTemp Land/Ocean Index values and Ni¤o 3.4 values, I computed 12-month running averages of Ni¤o 3.4 and compared them to the average GISTemp values at lags of 0, 3, and 6 months. Foster and Rahmsdorf used a diferent ENSO index and found optimal lags between 2 and 5 months. So one would guess that a 3-month lag would fit the data best in my case, and indeed it did.

But on a serious note, they kept talking about honor as one of the key traits to those kind of heroes. I kind of disagree with that. It’s loyalty that is key, not honor. There is a big difference between the two. My Duty, Honor, Country book has that at it’s core. Outside of that, though, they were very on target.

I am simply suggesting to you to RE-iterate on your forms and patterns just a bit if you will to try to explore “Other” channels to your direction and where you truely want to see change and how to bring forth such changes. There is SO MUCH each and every soul can offer in our world of existance in the here and now times. You see all the time people not able to heat their homes, feed their families and the list continues from there. OUTREACH directly to those whom you are so desiring to help and assist. DONT limit your energies to bicker backer back and forths that have now taken so much of your “Time” and not seeing much Effect as of yet. TAKE YOUR POWERS BACK within self and DIRECT them in TRUE FORM thru your movement and deliver them where you want to see the Cause and Effect from that action.

I had an unexpectedly Proustian moment the other evening with a bottle of Brooklyn East India Pale Ale. I was absent-mindedly putting the beer to my lips, and vaguely thinking about having visited the brewery in 2007. Garrett himself showed me round, and coincidentally, EIPA was in one of the kettles that day. As I breathed in, pre-sip, the big burst of floral and toffee aroma snapped me instantly back a couple of decades, to my first ever trip to New York. It was probably 1989, a time when New York was still the sleazy and dangerous city of filmic lore. I was visiting an American guy I had met while he was travelling in the UK. The precise scene evoked by this inhalation of aroma was a party at his apartment on Hoyt Street in Brooklyn. I'd been drinking black and tan for the duration of my visit, and like most Brits abroad, complained loudly about how crappy the beer was. In an attempt to shut me up someone handed me a bottle of the brand new Brooklyn Lager. I wearily, sneerily took the bottle, had a gulp, and was dumbfounded.

My battle is going on for over a year now with the help I pursued still without an accurate date. But with a lot of time on my hands that I'm home and not able to work, God is the One Who allows me to have that amount of time so I can learn and discover that "what I put into my heart is what will also come out." If I don't trust in Him and just make my heart heavy with worries, my blood pressure goes up and anger seeps in which is not pleasing to God in the first place.
Despite Romney’s well-established ability to shape shift his positions on any number of issues or topics, depending what audience he’s talking to at the time, he’s worked hard to put himself into a corner on lending even a pittance of pity to union workers in general and public union workers specifically. His antagonistic attitude toward government at all levels, especially the federal government, promising to take an ax to it if he’s elected, seems to working against him in Ohio, where public union workers, their family, friends and supporters, have not only not forgotten the battle they waged last year over SB 5, the bill that would have effectively gutted collective bargaining as its been successfully practiced for nearly 30 years, but appear ready to send another message to those who want to rub out unions by voting for the President.

15. Reviewing these books, we can now see that Banks set aside the notion of operating under the Charters they hold as banks, instead of being Banks they became like very poor casino operators and traders, selling what they do not own. The records in our possession, signed and registered by the receiving and managing commercial bank, show the underlying funds in numbers and amounts that stagger the imagination. The Green Hilton and Garuda Memorial Agreements demonstrate clearly the value of the global account system.
Yauch directed Beastie Boys videos under the pseudonym Nathaniel Hornblower, as well as the 2008 basketball documentary Gunnin' for #1 Spot under his own name.

In the mid-1990s, he co-founded the Milarepa Fund, which raised money for the Tibetan independence movement. They put on a series of benefit concerts, the Tibetan Freedom Concerts.

The date of the portrait sitting is a little more difficult to estimate, partly because the studio setting and furniture are not visible, but also because my knowledge of the subject of men's clothing fashions is meagre. It is possible that the subject sat for the portrait in the early to mid-1880s, as suggested by the mount, but I think it more likely that it is actually a copy of a slightly earlier photograph, taken perhaps in the mid- to late 1870s. Perhaps the man visited a studio first in the late 1870s, and then ordered a further copy of the portrait half a dozen or so years later.

Shirish asked, I had joined a company exactly on 10th Apr 2011 and got confirmation after six month. Now we had appraisal from 1st April 2012, they tell me that since I have 10 days short for one year completion, hence I am not eligible for the appraisal. Is is correct

It would be negligent to overlook the compliance of the mainstream media in the charade. Americans might not have been paying attention to details, but the alleged journalists of the mainstream media did little to provide honest details. The primary news media outlets were owned by corporations with plenty of motive not to rock the boat. If Americans had been exposed to the truth, perhaps they would have woken up sooner.

I came back to it almost a year later. Lately, I”ve been on a bug craze, particularly dragonflies. To me, these creatures represent many things, one being the magical properties of light. Their wings can bend and reflect light.
This adoption process, although in the same country Zoya was adopted from, was vastly different. We had friends, The Woods', which made the 3 weeks there so much less lonely. For Zoya's adoption, we spent 3 weeks alone in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere. We needed that experience and looking back I'm glad God gave that to us. For Mila's adoption, we were in the center of a city with lots to do and see. We got to experience so much more of the culture this time around, which I am grateful for. The process and legalities of things seemed to be easier in so many ways this time. The entire three week trip this time, I just kept saying, "I can't believe how different things are this time around." The region we were in had a lot to do with how different things were.
So here is what you'll be watching this fall on the Peacock network:

A word should be paid in tribute to the blu-ray version of this film: Dazzling! Originally shot on 70mm the picture is deep, and that has made all the difference in the 1080 transfer, enabling a dazzling clarity that lets you look up the nose of a man in a tank 5,000 yards away. The many long range desert battle seemed to be 3-D. The horizon line of the desert (this movie is always very horizon line conscious, and I respect that) warps the sides of the frame (Todd AO fisheye Cinerama 360 lenses) into a sloped elongated triangle, so it's like looking (from the top of the stairs) into a pinkish sand-colored diorama set in the wall of a sloping Victorian house attic bedroom. If ever there was a reason to get blu-ray, this or Polanski's REPULSION would be it for me. I tried looking at the GODFATHER blu-ray, but got freaked out that you could finally see Bonasara the Undertaker's yellowed teeth clattering in the shadows as he talked of "vengeance for my daughter!"
Veronique Vasseur, the prison physician, told me that the cells were full of rats and lice. Suicide is rampant, and depression lurks in every crowded cell. It has been said that prisoners with no other means had swallowed drain cleaner as a way to relieve the pain of life. With these thoughts in mind, the prisoners families and friends, who had often traveled to this place from many places around the world, met on the bench where we talked about families and loved ones and gave each other support.
But now I sat hurling across the Atlantic in the dark with "France" approaching closer and closer. My stomach quickly knotting, the sense of adventure gone this time around and all that is left in its place....a looming sense of isolation and incomprehension.

A simple card, but with huge impact. That out of his dark place and in his own particular way, he could still summon up enough strength to tell his mother that he cared for her.

On monday evenings I would finish my studies for the day at around four, and head down to the local community garden centre to help my friends cook (a by donation) dinner for the local community. This monday I was feeling a bit anxious for some reason, so after helping cook -(I made a mulberry salad with three different kinds of mulberry!!) sat down by myself inside and tried to avoid conversation. Eventually, as was always the case back then, I was drawn into one, it was a hot summer night, warm air and very still, so it was agreed that a group of us would head down the beach after dinner had worn off, and have a good long swim. Seemed like a good idea to me as it was very warm, and my mind was unusually anxious.
House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has a strong vibe with Romney, who is said to like the idea of running with a younger, more exciting conservative.

I find that quiche is very forgiving, so I like to play around with different types types of cheeses. Some quiche recipes rely on cream cheese to make the quiche silky and creamy and subsequently cut back on the amount of half and half. For this quiche, I added a bit of goat cheese to add creaminess, but you can skip this if you wish.

The inclusion of newspaper evidence, the importance of seemingly irrelevant facts, the insistence on the apparent insolvability of the crime, and the depiction of the police as inadequate (“many a school-boy is a better reasoner” 215) are all familiar characteristics of the detective novel. “It is doubtful,” claims Sayers, “whether there are more than half a dozen deceptions in the mystery-monger’s bag of tricks, and . . . Poe has got most of them, at any rate in embryo” (1928, 80).

The game also introduces the concept of companions as you’re given a small party to adventure with in the demo levels. While this is a cool concept and really fills out the class structure in your party, I felt that it made things a bit too easy. Your party is really good at what they do (except the healer decided not to heal me during combat) and even if you just run around like a nut, your party will continue to lay waste to the creature. They’re intelligent but may be a bit too intelligent. Never thought I’d be saying that. They tended to do a better job than even myself. I could have also done without the constant chatter from them. It all becomes a bit overwhelming when each person is continuously yelling things about what they’re doing and seeing the text scroll up the left side of screen seemingly every 5 seconds.
We are working on stocking the shop, but hopefully within the next week or so, we will be ready to open with the first of the bags adorned with polymer buttons. I love this little bee stamp! I used it quite a few times over the weekend. I call these buttons "Bees in Flight."
This year, I am most thankful for my sister's beautiful life and the courage that she has. She is the bravest person I know and has gone through so much in just 22 years, and she is still so positive, spontaneous, loving, and kind! I am so thankful for everything going so well with her surgeries and that this crazy season of her life is over and now she can heal, grow, and move on past the things that have been driving her nuts! :)
Both boys can get frustrated when she gets into their stuff or what they are doing. They do a pretty good job relocating to the dining room table when this happens. Originally, I let them sit on the end table, but now that their sister is pulling up, that isn't working at all either.

Beat 8 ounces of cream cheese and 1/3 cup sugar in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the bowl a few times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese and sugar, then the vanilla. Blend in the eggs and yolk, one at a time, beating well after adding each one. Beat in the orange zest and juice, then the sour cream just until it's completely blended. Stir in the cranberry puree until the batter is as uniform or marbled as you like.

Mr. Ixolite was in Mexico on his holidays and was looking to try the hottest chili he could find. He went into a restaurant and ordered a hot one. After the fire in his mouth had been put out, and he sat there gasping for breath, the waiter came up to him and said, “Excuse me, Senor Ixolite, we are very sorry, but we accidentally gave you the wrong chili. We gave you the mild one instead of this very hot one. Would you like it?”
I made a start and sorted out the boys clothes in piles of worn out, disgustingly worn out or too small. Some of the too small still had price tags on. They are hard to buy for. It all has to feel right and smell a certain way before they will put it on. I often buy clothes they scuttle off with and I never see them again as is shown by the tags on some. :( I know it wasn't cleaning but once I'd parked all the clothes they had none left ;) Well not quite none but they are down to a pair of shorts I'm not convinced will fit ( only D will wear them, a pair of pj's ( only D will wear them) and a top and jogging bottoms each. An emergency clothes shop is on the cards.
Kriffle’s father Proggle is “proud leader of the Triplifer tribe” but he is getting old. He’s at his wits’ end with the leaf issue and intends to bring the matter up that very day at the Fleedenhall debate. His wife will have none of it and tells him to permit Kriffle go in his stead. As it happens, the leader of the Quadrigons and head of the Fliddercouncil, Farggle, is also unwell and so his daughter, Fargeeta, stands up in his place. The debate does not go well. Elections are not far off and it doesn’t look as if the Triplifers are going to have any chance of winning unless Kriffle can find support elsewhere. He heads off to the Florddenbureau with its Kafkaesque snaking corridors to try and find support from an old friend of his father’s, Brakliff, who has risen over the years from third-assistant-junior-secretary to first-higher-senior-official-over-secretary but Brakliff is unwilling to help him. Then Kriffle visits the academics at Flooderversity but things are not easy there either: Professor Skervvle is only interested in the essence of leaves; Professor Horkelo's specialty is how many leaves there are; Professor Yangbelu only cares about the concept of leaf and, much to the consternation of his esteemed colleagues, Professor Sklinger only studies bark.

I remember the first time I bought a pint of bitter – when slightly underage – in 1976. It cost 21p. Now, obviously there has been a great deal of inflation since then, so it’s not surprising that the equivalent pint is now around £2.40, or more than ten times more. But how does that compare with the general movements in prices?
Club Shaft – Get forceful, last-second acceleration from your club shaft, which acts much like a whip. Feel where the club shaft flexes, and focus on stressing the club shaft midway down your downswing instead of at the top of your swing. This will allow you to get a more explosive impact.
As we counted down the days to our trip, Florida revealed its wild spring weather (torrential spring downpours) and the weather worsened. We debated between ourselves about taking our chances in the rain and figured we’d forgo comfort and just do it anyway. Carolina, Veronica, her boyfriend Ruel, and I made the two hour drive towards the area known as Flamingo, the southernmost point of the mainland United States. Checking in at the ranger station, the rain had thankfully slightly let up, so we checked in at the rangers station and picked our campsite, called “Lard Can Camp”.

To anyone outside of science fiction or soap opera fandom this is completely insane since the two are self-evidently the exact same fucking thing. To someone uninvolved in either there is no difference whatsoever in what die-hard sci-fi fans do and what die-hard soap fans do. Both are equally objects of mockery. One dresses up more, the other sends panicked letters in that don’t quite seem to grasp that the characters are fictional. But other than that they’re exactly the same thing.

You'll see from the picture that I've lost my half chaps so I need a new pair of those too. And no, I'm not buying blue ones :) Also you can see I'm riding Rogo bare back. While waiting for his incision to heal (it's close to the girth area), I've had two or three short bareback rides. I love it and he seems to like it too. We work on 10 m figure eight trot circles (he can do them quite well most of the time) leg yield (his hind quarters are still lagging but getting better), and a bit of trying to sit his working trot. Also we did canter circles a couple of times and I want to increase my confidence with those transitions. If I weren't going to Sue's I think I'd spend most of the winter bare back. As it is, I think I'll use it for cool down time.

If your client is in a bad mood, the idea is to understand that if you’ve been impeccable with your words, it probably has nothing to do with you. Thinking that you are the cause of someone’s bad (undisciplined, unkind, thoughtless, etc.) behavior is counterproductive and a waste of energy. We’ve all heard the expression, “Let it go.” If you happen to end up working with a difficult client, the message is to get the work done as expeditiously as possible and move on. That doesn’t mean you have to continue your professional relationship with this person, but it helps to realize that it’s not about you or your work.

Love at the 2nd hand store you say? Oh yeah! You may never understand the unorthodox way one could find love in a thrift store, so that’s why I’m writing. People search the world over looking for love. They often wonder can it be found in the arms of a prince charming (a congressman, a senator, the principle or the trainer at their favorite gym). Others wonder if miss perfect is waiting around the bend (the run-way model, the house wife who does all her house work in heels, or the one who’s just like momma). When real love could be staring them right in the face, wearing glasses, tennis shoes or riding the bus. Love, the magic between two people who come alive when they realize that all they want to do is be with one another. You know the magic moment that happens in the movies when two friends laugh hysterically and one touches the others hand a little longer than usual, they stop laughing, their eyes meet and they lean in for a kiss. That moment…

Everyone do hate pimples. Who doesn’t? For sure, nobody does welcome it. I for one have been combatting pimples since my early teen years.

My skin is so sensitive that I can’t use anything scented less I want breakouts.

We silly little human beings are obsessed by ourselves, we really are. Our entire lives revolve around our own being as we feel we are the centre of each of our own universes and nothing in the world will ever change that. So the very idea that when we, the lords of all creation, die, well, that's it folks, shows over chums, turn off the lights, feed the cat for me when I’m gone, etc, etc. Well it totally freaks our minds out because it kinda confirms that we aren’t really that significant and the world will in fact keep on turning after we pop our clogs.

Sight and Sound was terrific opportunity to be introduced to the work of so many gifted artists living and working here in the Artistic Zone on Vancouver Island.

With budget minded decor being the premise, I used Granny Smith Apples as table decor which also doubled as the guest favor.

While she was away, I sat in the chair by the window and read novels, marking up the margins with arrows and multiple question marks that underscored my utter failure in understanding the arc of the plot, let alone the subtle literary allusions and call outs to Shakespeare. In the late afternoons, when the wind picked up, I'd pull on a hoodie and jog along the beach.
At around the three quarter mark in the story, the crisis hits after she climbs to the top of a tower at the Ashram and asks to be shown everything she needs “to understand about forgiveness and surrender.” Up until this point in the book, we know she has been craving a resolution to her dissolved marriage. She would have loved to have an actual conversation with her ex-husband, but knows that will never happen due to the ugliness of the divorce, which had turned them into “two people who were absolutely incapable of giving each other any release.”
Let us observe, understand and accept ourselves as we are. Let us not reject ourselves overtly or covertly through expectations.
So of course i drew Sindy... incorporating the wonderfully freeing mark making and scribbles mix media background. I choose bright fun colours and drew Sindy quite loosely.
That’s not absolute evidence of dreaming, of course, for it doesn’t let us into the cat’s brain; it could simply reflect sequences of motor patterns that are wired in its brain. But it’s certainly suggestive that some dreaming is going on.
So I finish glazing the pots and set out at 9:10 with Buster our big lab. And we go by the yellow house, no sign of Ava, but Stephanie and her mom and the little baby are out front.
Some Filipinos are surprised to find that there is a street here in Singapore that was named after their nation’s capital. Manila being a major port and once center of economic and Christian missions during the Spanish era in all of Asia shares a long and deep history with Singapur. Just imagine the history that has transpired from our shores to theirs, ships that has gone back and fourth between the vast seas that separates the two state.
There is so much preparation required to help prepare souls for the coming of My beloved Son Jesus Christ.
While Khazanah approached local companies Naza Group and Sime Darby Bhd. about buying the Proton stake, Syed Mokhtar’s DRB may be the best fit, said Mahathir.
Also, I might have some stuff for sale in the upcoming weeks. I need to clean the cabinets!
thanks so much for crafting with me, mom! seriously, the only thing better than family is crafting with family
This is the last collection from My Little Shoebox to be revealed. It is a truly lovely collection of papers, stickers, cardstock, and 3D Roll-Up Flowers and banners. The colors are vibrant and lend themselves to cards, layouts and projects. I know you'll enjoy creating with this splendid collection!
1. They may help to lower your risk of getting cancer. (A review of research published in the October 1996 issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association showed that 70% or more of the studies found a link between cruciferous vegetables and protection against cancer.)

Rinse, dry and lightly season both sides of the pork chops. Spread a thin layer of dijon mustard on one side of each pork chop and then dredge in breadcrumb bowl. Spread remaining dijon on other side of each pork chop and dredge. Place pork chops on baking sheet and pat remaining breadcrumb mixture on top.

Later when I chose to be a teacher I knew that I wanted to be a teacher that made learning fun, like my own former teacher. I find many teachers are scared of math. Probably because most people aren't what they would consider good at math or it is their least favorite subject. Today I want to share with you guys a few ways to help make math more fun and interesting for your students.

Getting the state of a 6 button pad is a little more complex – it requires bit 7 to be set ON, and then OFF, and then ON again to retrieve the 3rd byte of data. For the moment I’ll leave it out, I don’t own any 6 button controllers for testing anyway.
This was our first year farming, and the learning curve was steeper than you can imagine. It was at the same time. When we took the leap into farming, overnight we became responsible for several hundred tiny little lives, and the weight of that responsibility was heavy. No matter what, our days were filled with hard work, and now the thought of anything being damaged and
is smoother and well, more eloquent. I think that would
The WHI study's intervention phase was stopped earlier in 2002 due to an increased risk of breast cancer among the participants taking HRT, compared to those taking a placebo.
I found three of these wood trays at the dump awhile back. A man was actually throwing them out when I pulled up beside him to unload some stuff for my husband. I was like, "WOWWWW, are you throwing those out"!?!?! He was so super nice and just started loading stuff up in my van! I went home from the dump that day with more than I went to throw out! That is the last time my husband has asked me to take anything to the dump for him!hahaha
Bubble Lord’s rampage begins.
Roeser, a former newspaper editor, says The Clubhouse will be published quarterly and is always looking for quality submissions and articles that would be of benefit to agency owners, large, small and everything in between. “It’s wonderful to be in the position to do something I am genuinely passionate about, while giving something to our profession that will make us all better practitioners, better professionals and in general, better agencies. Clients trust us with their hard earned dollars, and we must continually earn that trust. This magazine will help us remember who really pays the bills.”
Think drums, drums, drums, and more drums. They all play drums and sing, the main singer has the biggest drum set though and the other guys play keyboard, guitar and bass. That’s it, just these four dudes pounding out with so much intensity and having a fantastic time with it. Check out their E.P. Takers and Leavers here. But go see these guys, seriously, they are from Seattle so you should have ample opportunity.
I started watching this roe buck in the field at 9pm, it’s a shame he appeared so late as I’d like to have to photographed him in better light. I took this shot with the 100-400 L lens and used a lot of ISO to get this image as there was very little light available.
In the non-film categories, Arnau Bataller wins Best Score for a Television Series for the Spanish telenovela ERMESSENDA. Veteran Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi wins Best Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media for the Level-5 / Studio Ghibli game NI NO KUNI: WRATH OF THE WHITE WITCH.
My wife and I sat down to watch the news the other night together, both of which are rare happenings. Usually one of us is working or the kids are doing sport, scouts or something. The normal bad financial news, followed by rising crime statistics, and then a cute and furry animal story. In other words the norm, however interspaced amongst all this was a brief story on Graffiti, and how it was a blight on our city scape. The reporter went on to reveal the new initiatives for prevention and clean up, which in fact sounded remarkably like a rehash of previous ground breaking plans.
There are still some things left to do out there. Potatoes need to be dug. The last of the herbs need to be picked and dried, peppers need to be gleaned by the end of the week if there is no killer frost, and all the carrots need to be pulled.
It’s 03:35 in the afternoon, and I’m home alone again. I just spent a few hours with my beloved mother, she and I went out for sushi in the warm sunshine. Afterwards we walked to the police station so I could get my new passport, yay! Not long until I leave for Leipzig. And then we went to a store where mum bought two candles for herself, and coconut tea for me. ♥ Great.
3. Teeth should not be decorated.
I am, however, clearly at the bottom of the staining hierarchy - the three boys were working industriously away with paint pots and brand new brushes. I had an orange bucket and a paintbrush HB found in the garage, much as you would give to a well-intentioned child who wanted to help the adults. Hmph.
And I suspect that most of the women wearing these x-rated costumes are all buttoned-up-and-denim 364 days a year. But October 31 rolls around and that gives them an excuse to go all fishnets and stilettos and barely-there. Why is that?
Is it predictable? Yep. Have you seen this type of movie before? Probably. But is it a great movie? Hell yes. The fact that in the last fight I was on the edge of my seat, yet still knew the outcome of the movie is a testament of the power of this movie. It manages to connect with our base emotions and while it’s a story we’ve seen, it’s one we won’t get bored from. Add to that some great acting, as well as camera work that really captures what Mixed Martial Arts is all about and you have a movie that should please a fair few people.
expected something like this as I had been reading other blogs and comments for quite a while. I thought I was ready to deal with anonymous, uninformed criticisms. However, I was left reeling by an attack on my parenting by a member of my family!
Or yet if I act, or fail to act, in the manner of your design for action, let me be.
As well Timmie is back! That’s Cats old pal and neighbor, it will be fun to see how he or if he will develop in the series. I won’t tell you how the story goes because I’m a firm believer in you should be reading them yourselves, but I can tell you I loved it and can’t wait for the next one! As well I can’t wait for the next Night Huntress World book. Oh but the real thing I’m waiting on is Vlad’s books, he’s my man, my minds love slave and the fictional character I fantasize about most! Yes I like fictional characters in my fantasies, so sue me.
The mixture is simmered for 10 minutes. It is then strained and the juice is squeezed out. The liquid is measured and an equal amount of cream is added to it. This mixture is boiled until it reaches a soft, ointment-like consistency. It is cooled and can be applied to the nipples after the baby has finished nursing.
I had a hard time doing today’s blog. After all, no one is going to say, “Let them starve.” So instead what I did was find an article that shows how Americans say those words every day with the choices we make. But what that means is that, rather than interacting with an idea opposed to fighting poverty (I couldn’t find any), I’m interacting with a lifestyle that promotes poverty for most of the world. Therefore, the article I’m discussing is actually not a scholarly work but an article from the USA Today discussing American spending.
SELF was founded in 1990, though its mission has evolved from its initial focus on home lighting solutions to a wider range of projects, including medical clinics, small businesses and wireless communications. Current projects are mostly centered in sub-Saharan Africa and Haiti, working to generate incomes and empower communities.

What this means is that nearly all the ideas that are baked into HR help make organizations grow into unresponsive dinosaurs. You get GM as a result.

What Turkle suggests is this, "Face-to-face conversation unfolds slowly. It teaches patience. When we communicate on our digital devices, we learn different habits. As we ramp up the volume and velocity of online connections, we start to expect faster answers. To get these, we ask one another simpler questions; we dumb down our communications, even on the most important matters."
The group that was chopping wood would leave the camp at eight to search for a suitable tree to fell. Everybody had to have an axe.
But what more than makes up for all this is being with family and friends and the wonderful views from my cliff top. It really is idyllic here overlooking the Bristol Channel and on a clear day like today looking deep into the Land of my Father.... And other days out in the area provide other outstanding views.
I just realized that I have not posted in awhile. Sorry! I have been busy I guess.

In a saucepan, add the egg yolks, sugar , lemon juice and zest and whisk together until well combined. Over medium low heat continue whisking until mixture becomes thick and coats the back of a spoon. Remove from heat; stir in butter until melted and combined throughout. Place curd in bowl and cover surface with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.
The Civil War series (by director, Ken Burns, 1990)
While the main goal is to lower the youth suicide rates to do so, a bevy of concerns and issues must be addressed: Bullying, Depression, Eating disorders, OCD, Bi-polar Disorder, Self-Harm, Schizophrenia, Suicide, Violence, Sexual Abuse, GLBTQ issues and rights, etc. Though YA literature is not issue drive, kids and characters grapple with these concerns daily. Fantasy novels offer an escape (while still dealing with many of these same concerns in other wordly settings) and contemporary novels address the issues directly.

One of the first things that we were told was that the offenders are going to be expected to go throughout the facility for all of their services and nothing will be brought to them. This includes: meals, programming, jobs, recreation, medical, etc. They want the daily life of the offender to mimic (as much as possible) the life of the outside.
Again: is the physical book dead? Absolutely not. But the loss of Borders will, I think, hasten its transition to a secondary format.
I have read loads of lovely, wonderful, books since Christmas, Solace of the Road, by Siobhan Dowd, Desirable, by Frank Cottrell Boyce, Once, and Then, by Maurice Glietzman, Reavers Ransom, by Emily Diamand. I love books, honest. I even try and see the best in books which do nothing for me and are totally not aimed at a middle aged, female, Londoner.

Anger is what we feel when someone may have violated our boundaries or done something wrong or unacceptable to us. Just because we feel anger doesn’t actually mean that someone has done something wrong to us or that our boundaries actually have been violated. But it does indicate that something HAS HAPPENED and that we need to look into it and get to the bottom of it.
Metal Gear Solid HD Collection for the PlayStation®Vita will have optimized controls, making use of the Vita’s unique touch-screen and rear touchpad.

Although the Board admitted that is was "troubled" by Rodale's previously-acquired Supplemental Registrations, it was nonetheless convinced by the "clear evidence of genericness" present in this case.
This conditioning began from childhood and continues ruthlessly. The conditioning goes like ‘If you don’t do what you’re being told you’re going to be persecuted’. And basically, it’s applied everywhere – from my relationships with parents, women, friends to school and university. In order to survive I had to follow the rules – and so I became a social animal – caged in rules and dogmas.
It definitely means more prep work, but seems like a great way to spark interest in the books you’re talking about, and get a better sense of your audience’s preferences.

It’s enough to drive you to drink. As this purports to be in some way a beer blog, albeit admittedly not a very good one, what lout would our future King and Sovereign be getting pissed up on? What grog by Royal appointment? I checked it out here. This is all the stuff the Queen agrees to stick “By Royal Appointment” on, presumably for either freebies or backhanders.

It's also necessary to warn you that your breath may harm small animals and children. Certain veteran cheese-eaters will sport one of these post-consumption. It's like a condom for your face. Sure, it's not the most attractive thing in the world, but neither are you after eating those vachebombs.

However, the debate itself, and indeed those debating, are of less relevance than was the parting shot by the bigwig from the Campaign for Racial Engulfment, who, just as Kirsty was terminating the discussion, turned to his adversary and smugly announced that a multi-cultural society was “the reality of modern Britain”.
Rosemary Debenham was waiting with her daughter and grandson, who needed a blood test, when the drama unfolded. Mrs Debenham said: “An elderly gentleman with two walking sticks came into the upstairs department. He said as he was not very mobile and he was frightened of missing his slot, he would wait upstairs until his number was called.” What could possibly go wrong?
Character has extra appendage or organ not usually found in his species. Examples include: A third eye in the back of his head, light sensitive antennae, arms and hands (for a fish or other species that normally doesn't have limbs), a head or brain for a Plant. The players always design the new parts, but the GM must approve the design. Now, I appreciate the brevity of this entry and its reference to the GM as the final authority in determining what is an acceptable new body part. However, as Maxstadt notes at the start of his article, "Some players have trouble inventing original mutations which are more than mere variations of the official mutations in the book." Likewise, there's always a tug of war between player and referee in trying to decide just what sort of mutation is "too much."

You have the choice to alter a clock or any other item this week. The catch is it has to be for your space. It could be something you will use to organize other things in, something for your wall, a sign for your room or just something pretty for your desk. You just have to find something to alter. That is the creativity challenge. But please, make sure you get a clock!
Perhaps I cut a size too large? It's a bit loose.
Now I doubt McCarthy would agree with me, and the critics above would be quick to point out that it is my categories (my sense of elitist belief that I know what good painting “is”) that animates this quite false sense of sympathy and pity. They would also point out that McCarthy’s point in testing those categories of my false reading, and those feelings, is to show how underneath it all, they are arbitrary. The same would be true if I feel this sympathy and pity at McCarthy’s disgusting dinner parties, where he ends up drinking fluids out of his anus with a tube, sticking hotdogs in all sorts of inventive places, and rolling around in ketchup. The “correct” reading would be that McCarthy shows a certain American lifestyle and happiness to be barely capable of concealing its primitive impulses and that when the bubble bursts, it reveals the chaos. It “shatters boundaries” and that is what the wall labels and curatorial statements end up saying. The only thing missing is a reason to care.
Yep, purple and pink are two of my favourite colours! Purple more than pink really but both colours stood out when I was surveying the 'zoo' (my extensive collection of ami's! If you're new to my blog- here's a post in which I revealed the 'zoo'... yes, I am a self confessed amigurumi addict!!)
In our rapidly evolving global context, Western nations, including Canada, are asking the question “To whom does the future belong?” We watch with wonder, and not a little envy, as emerging economies spread their wings and take off, seemingly overnight. Countries that have struggled with poverty and development are becoming economic miracles, blessed with stratospheric growth and a new-found confidence to compete in complex industries with established world leaders.
So feeling like I haven’t had anything shareworthy to, well, share, has really been a roadblock on my writing journey. My feelings of self-worth have always been tied up in what I’ve accomplished, and the rekindling of my long-dormant relationship with depression made it physically impossible to feel like I’d accomplished anything, let alone something to be proud of to share with the class.

I wrote Nothing But Trouble when I saw the call out for the Honky Tonk Hearts series with The Wild Rose Press. Cowboys, a honky tonk bar, a bull named Stud Muffin… (Okay Stud Muffin was my addition. LOL) What could be more fun than that! I hope everyone who reads Nothing But Trouble has a smile on their face when they finish and a warm feeling in their heart for the HEA ending.

Innocence can’t be restored, but purity can. The Lord has been teaching me this week that without purity spiritually sensitive people will be aware of evil and what the evil one is up to, but with restored purity we can see, like Elisha’s servant Gehazi, that the forces for God are much greater, and we have no reason to live in fear. Impurity leads to anxiety and fear. Purity leads to assurance and confident courage as we can now have our eyes opened to the things of God.

The furor over Wilson would lead to Congressional oversight into the EATSCO contract, which would find over $8 million in overbilling. EATSCO would lose the contract. Shackley and Clines had already been forced to leave the CIA due to their association with Wilson. Shackley, who had long been expected to be a future head of the agency, lost that possibility in the uproar.
As part of the program, fighters can go into the center annually for a free MRI and a battery of tests. Jesse Magdaleno, 20, a super-bantamweight participating in the study, says, “If the doctor told me my health was at risk, I would stop. I am not going to let boxing control me. I have to think a long time down the line, my health, my family.”
The Koch Theater stacks high – two, three, four levels. During the technical rehearsal, the director coached her to sing to the people in the last row on the last tier. And she did just that! A wee little thing she is (maybe five feet tall, no more than 90 lbs), she stood center stage and shared her story of Kamlari, or indentured servitude, through this song.
Nate Larson and Marni Shindelman - GEOLOCATION: TRIBUTES TO THE DATA STREAM - Our collaborative work examines virtual communication and its impact on physical encounters. We follow strangers through their Twitter updates, becoming intimately involved in their banal daily errands. Using publicly available embedded geotag information in the updates, we track the locations of the Twitter users through their GPS coordinates and make a photograph to mark the location in the real world. Each of these photographs is taken on the site of the update and paired with the originating text. This work is a means for situating the virtual into the physical realm. We imagine ourselves as virtual flâneurs, ethnographers of the Internet, exploring cities 140 characters at a time through the lives of others.

The Alchemist is about a young boy named Santiago who sets out to live his dream instead of settling down into mundane everyday life like so many of us do.
