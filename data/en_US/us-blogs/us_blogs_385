By outlawing or significantly restricting the use of tobacco in “public” view, Smoking Bans are clearly in the best interests of corporate market share. They are decidedly NOT in the best interest of the public and certainly not in the best interest of the business owners that specifically cater to people that choose to smoke.

Brother Carl dropped me off at the trailhead on Monday with instructions to come back on Thursday, and off I went with the world’s heaviest backpack. The weight was mostly water (isn’t always); I was carrying nearly 1.5 gallons in two plastic water bladders, intending to hike to a what the map labeled as a “spring.” You can’t always believe what you read, so I wanted to have enough water to get me there and back. Of course I drank water freely.
Five of the spikes later I was passing by the outskirts of Ankola. The highway doesn’t pass through the town, which I guess must be right on the coast, instead heads north touching just the outskirts. So all I saw of Ankola was the slums and the garbage and this was a rather hard blow to the image of the nice coastal town I had in my head. I left the town behind and stopped at a chai-kade, roadside tea stall, to refill water and get some biscuits. I also asked if there was a place to stay and he said no. it was 5:10pm and Karwar was about 35k away. I was hoping to find a place somewhere before Karwar, before the sun set.
Spring has officially sprung here!
I think I love this look #1 for the nostalgia factor. It brings up memories of 5 year old birthday parties and rides home looking down at my red tight covered legs bearing traces of a good time had : dried white icing, punch stains and a torn knee ( good for sticking your thumb and fore finger in to make bigger ) Who wouldn't want to bring that back into their grown-woman repertoire of looks?
I have now made about 75 different "word of the day" activity sheets and I am really pleased that my class love doing them so much that they actually ask when they can do another one!

Nass el Ghiwane - what can I say. Like trying to introduce rock and roll in one blog post. They set the world of Maghrebi music on fire in the early '70s. Fierce, driving rhythm. Trenchant resonant lyrics. Fiery group singing, heartbreaking solo singing. Archaic and modern, subversive and traditional. And, to the best of my knowledge, the first time the now ubiquitious Gnawa guinbri (or sintir or hajhouj or whatever name your prefer) was used in a popular music context.

I've started journaling again, and the simple act of putting pencil to paper calms me, centers me in a way that blogging hasn't yet.(Although I'm very fond of them both) Blogging is like writing letters - you're aware that someone is going to read it, somewhere, but writing in a journal can be entirely yours.
Less than a week later, on 25 March, the tragic Triangle Fire in New York City took the lives of more than 140 working girls, most of them Italian and Jewish immigrants. This event had a significant impact on labour legislation in the United States, and the working conditions leading up to the disaster were invoked during subsequent observances of International Women's Day.

What “militant action” may mean is of course open to interpretation. But we see in the Cleveland bombing case where some Occupiers went. If you need to kill people to allegedly free them, it could be that there is something off in your calculation.

In contrast to Reza’s multitude of shifting perspectives, Jonathan Safran Foer’s 2005 novel Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close offered an intriguing first-person self-portrait of precocious youngster named Oskar Schell, contrasting personal and public loss in the aftermath of 9/11. Told from Oskar’s perspective, the novel is densely narrated and punctuated by typographic experiments that reflect the young boy’s quest to ‘solve’ the final puzzle left behind by his father, who had died in the World Trade Center attacks. Unsurprisingly, Stephen Daldry’s film version (adapted for the screen by Eric Roth) suffers precisely because cinema – especially mainstream, commercial cinema – simply does not lend itself to those kinds of highly internalised narratives. As a novel, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close draws its impact from this internalisation, delving deep into Oskar’s world and taking the reader along for the ride. And although the book wasn’t immune from similar criticisms, attempts to translate this world onto the screen saw Daldry’s film shouted down (in the UK at least) as ‘annoying’, ‘irritating’ and ‘cloying’.
It was a bold-faced lie. The troops may have been acting on false information or may have panicked but there is little doubt that many innocent people were killed. Worse still, the incident was hushed up, only surviving as whispers through time.
Finally, wages did not hold up well at Black-owned companies. Black-owned firms dropped average wages by 3 percent in real terms to $22,584 (in 2002 dollars), while White-owned firms increased them by 2.1 percent to $30,298 (in 2002 dollars).

1. The only tricky part to this endeavour is making the basket. Be sure your watermelon has a flat bottom so it will be able to stand freely and is as blemish free as possible. Begin by using a pairing knife to score the portions that are going to be cut away. You will be removing the top half of the watermelon on the outer edges. Basically, from halfway up the watermelon to the top will be completely removed except for about 3 inches in the middle for the handle.
As the next lady entered the waters with her husband, she gave a sweet testimony of how she was raised in the church and always throught her testimony was ordinary, but recently God has revealed how his grace is never ordinary. One thing I love about our church is that each one is baptized by someone who has lead them in their walk with the Lord. As the husband took his wife by the hand, I was overwhelmed by the picture of our Great Bridegroom who leads us to the waters from wherever we have been.
OK, your turn – show me what you’ve got.

Right now as I write, it's early October, pre-Halloween. Alongside of the rows of trick-or-treat candy and costume accessories are rows of Christmas decorations and housewares, with likenesses of Santa Claus, gingerbread men, snowflakes, and angels. It seems we only see angels among us during November and December. Is that the only time God allows these heavenly beings He created to breach the veil between heaven and earth? What do they do when they're not adorning our Christmas tree? Does God pack them away in a box when January rolls around?
The There-Were-Multiple-Authors theory and the This-Is-a-Reported-Text theory, by the way, are not mutually exclusive, which obviously further complicates the matter of establishing authorial responsibility; then we have the further complicating issue of the play's being based largely on a work by Medievial author John Gower — a close personal friend of Geoffrey Chaucer, but not nearly as talented —and therefore possibly written in an intentionally simplified form because Gower was pretty much viewed by Renaissance authors (including Shakespeare) as an Olde-Tyme-y writer of simple verses. So it's possible some of the clunky lines — at least the ones put in Gower's mouth — are intentionally clunky and shouldn't necessarily be counted as evidence of authorship by a lesser talent than Shakespeare.

We broke up in October, you got a new girl friend in December. You said you loved her and some of your friends joked on your facebook that it wouldn’t last and you didn’t agree. I was sad, but happy for you all in one. I’d been rekindling things with my ex and was happy with him, but missing you still. Life and love are so odd, huh? I’m probably not making any sense. I don’t even know what I’m trying to say anymore. I guess that life goes on.

I have tried all manner of different pillows and recently went along to one of our finest shops in pursuit of comfort and support. I took all the pillows from the shelves and lay them on the shop floor, for many a time I have purchased a pillow which felt luxurious only to find it useless. This time I was going to put them to the test by laying on them. This was worse than Goldilocks's ordeal. At least she only had 3 choices! The shop assistant came over and asked if she could help me. I think she'd been told to remove the mad woman lying on pillows in the shop since this is a terribly posh store. I explained that since spending hundreds of pounds in here to no avail I was well within my rights to do some consumer testing. Very soon I had a few people helping me out and offering me advice on the benefits of goose down or other. In the end I plumped for a bouncy pillow that offers all the comfort of memory foam yet bounces back to aid support.

"Songbird is a beautiful story about growing up, loving, and moving past tragedies. Dani is a realistic character who is constantly struggling to put the horrific memories of her past behind her. She loves her best friend Reece, but she can't separate him from the image of her dead brother. It takes a former foster brother and a series of mysterious calls for her to take a step into the present. The characters are wonderfully written and I cried a number of times, realizing that the situations Dani has been in are not as uncommon as people would like to think."

Do readers care whether reviews are late? Unlike newspaper editors, they don't pore over every other paper noting what's in where. Nor do they believe a book has the approximate shelf life of a pint of milk. I understand the 'news' aspect of 'newspaper' and wouldn't want to go to the extreme of the London Review of Books which thinks nothing of reviewing a book a year late. But a bit of review-date slippage is fair enough.

It can be served over potatoes as we show here or perhaps you might prefer rice or even noodles. It is definitely hearty enough to eat on it’s own. The wine pairing here is Vinho Verde which is a very young white which I am told goes excellently with this dish – but I don’t drink wine so if you are like me I would suggest either Stella Artois because it’s a nice light Lager and it lends itself nicely to most meals without over powering or a gin and tonic with with thinly sliced limes as a refreshing non-wine pairing. I hope you enjoyed this post – I’ve been meaning to photograph and write it for quite some time now and I’m glad I did as this is one of our favourite seafood dishes and now perhaps it can become one of yours.

You always have choices - some are hard, seemingly impossible perhaps - but the choices are there just the same. Need proof? Look at every parent who has left an abusive spouse, or at children who have moved back home to care for ailing parents. Through seemingly impossible odds, people like these have chosen the thing that was right for their hearts, instead of the thing that was easy. For whatever reason, so many other people feel like they have been trapped and cannot escape to pursue their dreams. But for many of them, this "trap" is one of their own making - they bought the cars, they took the jobs, they put their kids in school, and they bought the houses. They created a "reality" for themselves and their families that seems impossible to escape from.
But it's okay -- because everyone feels this way.

Then I had kids and found myself sitting around on the couch a lot. Spenser cried a lot and there were very few things that calmed him down. One of them was Jeopardy and the other as baseball. If you watch enough baseball you either get so bored you gore your eyeballs out with the remote control or you begin to appreciate it. I could never find the remote so I began appreciating it. It also helps that baseball falls in a dead zone of the television season where nothing but reality shows and crappy burn off pilots are shown so it’s the lesser of the evils.

This Q showed up immediately on Star Trek: The Next Generation, right in the very first scene of the pilot, and he was originally depicted as a representative of a nearly omnipotent species that is deeply ambivalent toward humanity. Played with zeal every time he showed up with John de Lancie, Q put all of humanity on trial through the persons of Picard and the rest of the bridge crew. I think the character of Q went through evolution, though, as all characters do. Originally, Q was seen more as a trickster character, but then he became more of a gadfly through whom the Enterprise crew learned their deeper lessons about the universe and about life. Most of Q's episodes were highly memorable: it was Q who made the Borg aware of the Federation; it was Q who greeted Picard in the afterlife and somehow arranged for him to experience an astonishing life lesson.

Yes folks I am still here! LOL! Really! It has just been so very busy around my homestead lately.
I think there are fairly smart Pentagon thinkers who don’t see this so much as a question of regions, or categories of nation-states, so much as holes, or enclaves within the system. One of the best things I ever read about this was actually William Gibson’s novel Virtual Light. Gibson proposes that, in a world where giant multinational capital is supreme, there are places that simply aren’t valuable to the world economy anymore – they don’t reproduce capital – and so those spaces are shunted aside. A completely globalized system, in Gibson's view, would leak space – it would have internal redundancies – and one of those spaces, in Virtual Light, is the Bay Bridge.
Thailand is a wonder of complex variation. And so it can be said of the music scenes that abound here.
Hi everyone! ﻿Welcome to the 3rd annual Mother of All Blog Hops sponsored by There She Goes Clear Stamps!

Dad got a Croquet mallet to use as his masthead. Then he started circling around the bully, saying, "Toot toot! Toot toot!" After he circled a couple of times, Dad got behind the bully and whacked him right on the head with the Croquet mallet and knocked his ass out. TKO. Then he put the Croquet mallet down the bully's pants so that when he came to he couldn't get up and run right after him and Dad took off for safety.

Now that Lauren Graham has signed on, I’m there!
Blogging is good for my girlish figure. I’m in shape, pear-shaped, but a shape. My wife is a bit of a compulsive snacker and snack buyer, especially if it’s on sale. Under the stairs, just off the rec room we have a small storage room. We have six bags of four different flavor potato chips. We have three piles of large chocolate bars. We have four different kinds of nuts, a box of chocolate truffles, some roasted pumpkin seeds from Halloween, some pretzels, some cheese twists and some Toffeefay. If we go downstairs to watch TV at night, I have very little won’t-power. She’ll suggest a snack, and our weight goes up. I should come upstairs to blog more often. No snacks. No temptation! No weight gain.
So here comes the question(s). Do I go the digital or traditional Project Life route? I love things about both. Also, the decision is not a matter of software or knowing Photoshop. (I have Photoshop and use it regularly.) So I am hoping this is where you all will come in helpful. :) Do any of you use Project Life and what route have you gone? What do you love about your method? I'd love to hear anything you might have to offer. For those digital Project Lifers, where do you print? That is my big hang up with going digital, I've seen prices from $1.99 to $2.99 per page. Just to note, I probably won't be getting a core kit. I already have quite a number of digital kits that I would rather use digitally or print out on paper.
Say hello goodbye
Well, at long last, I come to you with a new realization about myself. I have FINALLY found out what is wrong with me (besides the very obvious).

So here’s where the serious part starts. Food. Specifically, Retro Lunch Food. If you have gone camping you know that a simple bowl of soup followed by a cup of camp coffee and a peach cobbler that’s baked in the coals all night is pure heaven-on-Earth. Something about that menu is better than if it was made at home. The same is true for ‘Road Food’. Except this isn’t your ‘typical Road Food though…. It’s definitely a few cuts above the ‘Old Hot Dawg Stand’….. This is a Road Side Sweet Shack that delivers the goods, in Retro-style. We’re not looking for something complicated. We’re not looking to get overwhelmed by 14 pages of selections like the typical Jersey Diner Menu. We want a few choices of good, easy, delicious, munchable fares to bring that wonderful fullness to our belly, a smile to our mouth and still leave enough room for a dessert. There is a breakfast menu which includes waffles and is served all day, a short and simple lunch menu, a fun selection of retro soft drinks and shakes (and malts and egg creams) and desserts. Dreamville fits the bill. Especially when it comes to the deserts! I would almost say that there is too much to choose from…. Almost. And it’s all baked daily. It was clear to me that when we stopped in Saturday afternoon, Jess had already put in a full day’s work! She looked a bit tired, but then, she had shelves of fresh bacon (yes, I said, chocolate covered bacon… dark chocolate!) other desserts, more desserts and desserts I had never seen, nor heard of before! Oh, and did I mention she had her 3
So I turned to google. The first video I watched was hilarious, but not in a good way. If you watch it, picture me, completely panicked, sitting there listening to them list off the 423 supplies you will need to get the wax off the carpet. Oh, and then if it's colored wax, you will probably have to call "the professionals." Thanks for the faith.
He averaged about 10 points and 8 boards for his 4-year career at GW, and also pretty much willed GW back into the NCAA tournament game in his senior year against UNC-Wilmington when the team was down 18 early in the second half. During a timeout he yelled at the other players that their careers were about to be over, which got them fired up and they came back and won. It was a great game.
I have to admit, one reason the ad caught my attention. It featured one of Mr. Spice's favorite shops in Austin- Stag.

Here’s a nice pun: Harry wants fruit cut into cubes, the way only Carly does. ‘Cause “that’s what makes you beautiful.”
When we discovered I was pregnant with Alexa, I had not long graduated from University, and actually, was still not employed. I fell into a retail job within a few days of finding out our news and naturally once we had settled ourselves on really going for it with the whole parenting thing I had a call. Not just any call but a call about "the dream" paid graduate intern job at a children's charity in London I'd applied for before I'd even finished final exams...always the way with me! Not taking the chance and attending the interview regardless of being pregnant has never been a regret of mine-i'm a firm believer of everything happening for a reason-but sometimes I will have moments of mild panic...
I live in England and the London Rioting started because one guy was shot dead by the police as the young guy had a gun but there was no proof that the young guy tried to used it so the young people thought this was wrong and started the first day of rioting.
Okay, so this past weekend, we flew up to PA to meet our friends and drove to our old college town. It’s a fun trip we like to plan in the spring, hanging out with cool people, pretending to go back in time when we didn’t have “grown-up” responsibilities. All together is was a fantastic, care-free weekend (but also ultimate fail with workouts and nutrition). I knew a lot of fried foods, drinks, and late night eating were on the agenda so I tried to maintain the idea that I would keep it somewhat under control. Nope…that did NOT happen. I mean it’s a little hard in a place where it is deemed acceptable to drink out of a pitcher.
The Cuomo plan promises that the industry will adhere to “state of the art” standards, but who will be watching the drillers to make that true? Preparatory to this new era Governor Patterson ordered that 209 employees from the Department of Environmental Conservation and then fired Environmental Conservation Commissioner Pete Grannis when Grannis sounded an alarm about the ffect of this on the department. (See: DEC commissioner fired after layoff memo leak: Pete Grannis ousted after warning of effects of planned job cuts, by Brian Nearing, Capitol bureau, Thursday, October 21, 2010, Paterson stands alone in firing: Governor's ouster of Pete Grannis as DEC chief called "mugging of Mother Nature", by Brian Nearing, Saturday, October 23, 2010 and Grannis and hydraulic fracturing: Ousted DEC head talks about future of natural gas drilling in America, by Marie C.

I also found the language in the article implying that our clients “buy” us to be extremely offensive. My clients don’t “buy” me. Rather, they pay me for work. My body still belongs to me and when I leave my sessions with clients, I still have it attached to me. Thus, I’m not “selling my body”.
Originally from Montreal, I now consider myself a Calgarian. When I first got here in 1990, Calgary’s population was around 625,000. As of 2011, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839. Calgary has seen a lot of growth! What really makes Calgary unique is its Stampede which is held every year in July. It attracts visitors from all over the world. The Calgary Stampede was started in 1912 and that makes this year even more exciting as we will be celebrating our 100th year!

The story of the Schalcken Replica began on the morning in February when Athelstan Digby received the letter from Evan Evans. He had never heard of the name before in connection with pictures; its reiteration seemed to him to be totally unnecessary, and he was prejudiced against the man, even before he realised that the letter was the usual request for permission to view his collection.
So, he decided to peek through the windows before going in. However, the closer he got to the windows, the more he realized they were covered in that reflective stuff that keeps the afternoon sun out. He did what everyone does ... kind of moved back and forth seeing if he could see in. Then, in a last ditch effort he put his face up to the glass and his hands around his eyes to peer in. He hadn't much more than pressed his nose to the window when ...

Well, a month or two ago I (it was actually Jon) found this wingback chair on Craigslist. I had been eyeing a pair of wingbacks, but the lady would not lower the price...I stopped looking and then Jon found this chair. This is the Carter chair by Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams which retails for around $1700 - who would honestly pay so much for a chair? Not I...even if I had the moolah.

Thats mostly what I have known / learned. It's cool to finally hear this EP and while it doesnt hold a candle to members later projects it is a cool entry into the history of Hardcore. People had requested this too, so this ones for you. We should talk about Outspoken after this. They were a great Cali hardcore band from this time.

hb The poem I should have sent to the person I will always love, only I lost my nerve.
“Bert …” Nathaniel paused, squared his shoulders, and continued with a firm, unyielding voice. “I am not real. I am a figment of your imagination. Well, more accurately, I am a manifestation of all your more assertive qualities.” His announcement finally concluded, Nathaniel fell into the nearest chair, holding his head. “There, I said it.”

Released via Rising Records, Made In China is an album that connects instantly but holds a depth and thick wealth within that makes each visit a new and rewarding experience. From the opening Terrorists the band hit hard but with definition and glorious senses shuffling invention. Beefy riffs and sturdy rhythms pounce immediately to give the perfect wake up call to the immersive melodic jazz lined manipulations that follow. A continual side stepping into distinct and unique areas keeps the song a brewing challenging mesh of feisty intensity and melodic enterprises that scorch and caress equally. The result is a track that takes the essences of the likes of early Incubus, Faith No More, An Entire Legion, and Dog Fashion Disco into the politic and aggressive steel of Circus Of Dead Squirrels. The song is magnificent and one of the best so far this year, something the remainder of the album eagerly and mightily challenges persistently.

Because Cotton Fleece is twice as thick as Cotton Fine, the project should work equally well using a *either* a double strand of Cotton Fine and the yarn amounts given in the book, or with a single strand of Cotton Fleece using the yarn amounts I posted to this blog a few days ago. People who bought yarn based on either of those recommendations should be OK. The colors are the same for both yarn lines.
He was also joined by Wanda and Pietro Maximof, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. The two of them, as it turned out were mutants, and what is more they were the children of Magneto. They were not really evil, and the X-Men were more then aware of this. Wanda and Pietro left the Brotherhood of mutants and searched for a better way to use their powers and hopefully, use them for a good purpose. Their membership into the team, as well as the later involvement of X-Men members Beast and Wolverine, unintentionally helps fulfill the dream of Xavier : mutants fighting side by side with normal humans for the same cause, and what is more they are treated as equals. Later, former Soviet Spy, Natasha Romanov aka The Black Widow joins the team.
Data journalism is obviously developing quite quickly as news rooms and freelancers try to make the most of new digital data sources for telling stories. In fact the work in journalism is really great and creative, far ahead of the social sciences in most cases (maybe because of their unconstrained sociological imaginations?). As things develop in this area it is not surprising that help guides are emerging to inform journalists in how to get the most from data. Here is a post at flowingdata about a digital data help guide for journalists, and here is a link to the full guide itself.
They make one especially keen point: if it were really about adding efficiency, why do the same people lead takeovers in many industries, instead of people with specific expertise in each industry doing the job? Their answer is that these specialists are specialists in deal-breaking, not value creation.

In a first window PGR, the petition must be filed within 12 months of the patent’s issuing. The presumption of validity for the patent does not apply, but the petitioner has the burden of proving invalidity by a preponderance of the evidence. This window is designed as an extension of the examination process. The expectation is that those who are interested in fields of patents – or in certain patent holders – will assiduously follow the issuance of the patents that interest them, and be ready to bring to the USPTO’s attention any immediate concerns.

In their publishing guide, Xlibris do the usual ‘self-published’ name dropping of well known authors who pursued this route, but many of these authors self-published in the truest form, that is, under their own name or personal imprint. Xlibris offer a standard ‘non-exclusive’ contract, granting the author ownership of all rights, and allowing them to move to a traditional publisher. It should be borne in mind that if an author opts out after publishing with Xlibris, then the cover work and all layout files remain with the publisher, meaning, should the author move to another POD publisher, they are effectively starting from scratch. This still remains the norm, and I personally believe it is something that must change with the leading POD publishers. After all, the author is paying for the ‘publishing service’ and the author should be allowed to take all files concerned with the production of their book with them at the time the period of the contract ceases.
And graceless.
So it now is with alcohol. Alcohol consumption in the UK in fact peaked in 2004 and has been declining ever since. It's now 11% lower than it was. There was an especially large fall in 2009. The UK ranks also below the European average in terms of consumption, an underreported fact that may have something to do with Britain's having the second-highest level of alcohol duty in the EU. The fall in consumption has been most dramatic among young people (the same is true of smoking) as a combination of draconian ID-checks (these days, you're lucky to be sold a bottle of wine no questions asked if you're under 40), rising prices and a media obsession with teenage drunkeness has made the traditional slow transition to the adult world of social drinking far more difficult to accomplish. This, of course, may help to explain why, when they finally are allowed to drink, so many young people seem unable to handle it.
The sparge progressed rather slowly, I suspect due to the presence of the rye and the dark munich. They seemed to shatter to a higher degree in the mill than the other grains. I don't have the luxury of being able to adjust the fineness of the grind for the different grains; the mill is set right where I want it for the bulk of what I brew and I'm afraid to tweek it.
I’m not sure we could learn so much from a painting, even by Holbein. He certainly wouldn’t have allowed his sitters to behave as the men in this last picture do, where not even one is looking in the right direction.

In general, yes it's true that a commuter who's on a train isn't driving, and therefore not polluting, using gasoline or running people over. But that's where the park-and-rides come in. If a commuter is only on your train for half their commute, they're still behind the wheel for the other half, polluting, burning gas and putting lives in danger the whole way. And if they then stay in the car for errands on the way home, that's more driving, plus they're shopping at car-oriented stores.

You know how it seems that every wedding has a story...and most of those stories involve something that happened the night before the wedding? Like at my SIL's wedding the guys went out after the rehearsal dinner, across from the hotel (which, come to think of it was a Hilton), and one of the groomsmen was a Cincinnati Bengal and people just wanted to pick a fight because he was a Cincinnati Bengal in Bethesda, MD, and the next day there was a lot of jockeying around with bottles of Maybelline trying to cover black eyes and such.....

I discovered the painting while perusing Google image for something else that would fit the pastor’s sermon. It struck me as slightly sad. One woman in the background is picking roses.

In the 192 page companion book – “Landscapes of the Abys”, White begins with the thought that art is the language of the soul. This has never been more evident than in this deck! Part of White’s intentions with this book are to reveal the glorious paths that run through the iconography, the history, and the innovations in the Tarot. She speaks of the Major Arcana as originating in the Middle Ages, in one of the most artistically creative times in all of humanity. That it is a universal key that can be used to write the powerful name of every single thing, including God. The Minor Arcana are seen as the poetry written with the alphabet of the Major Arcana, and are seen to be every bit as important. White sees a perfect symmetry between the two – one representing the world of spirit, the other the corporeal world.

These workshops are a bit noisy as the children shout out ideas, then another child will carry on with it, or change it, and the story gets crazier and crazier. I like that. I like to see children bursting with ideas. And when I tell them we’re going to do some freewriting, that they’re not to worry about spellings or grammar for now but to just write their story down and go back over it later to correct it, their pencils practically whizz over the paper. Many a teacher has told me how refreshing they’ve found it to forget all about structure for a while and let the children use their imaginations with no restrictions. I think it’s good for us authors to do that too. Sometimes we just need to write what’s in our head and see what story comes out. We can always go back and tidy it up after.

In this respect, it’s remarkably similar to losing weight (for those who don’t know, 7 years ago I used to be around 90lbs heavier). Short-term, quick fixes rarely work in the long term, and might even be counter productive. It’s known, for example, that 95-98% of all diets fail – that is, within 2 to 3 years the dieter has put back on all the weight they lost, and in many cases more. In order to sustain the weight loss, you have to shift from thinking about diets and move to thinking about a lifelong commitment to healthy eating. If you choose to eat healthily, and stick with it, then weight loss becomes an inevitable side effect.
Don't avert your gaze for a second or else you'll miss Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (The Pom Pom Girls) as "White Prostitute," who utters the line, "Whores give it away, stupid," in response to a cop's query about the difference between whores and prostitutes (the way her right eye twitches ever so slightly when she says "stupid" was außergewöhnlich), and the gorgeous, Traci Lords-esque Stacy Everly as "Teenage Prostitute," who gives a haunting performance as a visibly distraught junkie handcuffed to a bench. Actually, you can avert your gaze all you want during the latter's scenes, as she appears twice and spews a respectable chunk of dialogue.

It’s in the book. I just didn’t know what Duncan was on about when he talks about “the Conradian truth: The first horror is there’s horror. The second is you accommodate it.” Now we do.

As a foster parent of (pretty much all) special needs/handicapped pets; those calls are utilized much more than in a regular situation – and often times my decision is that of “let it go” – if it happens, it happens.

I … had helped you become a lovely young woman. You learned that you were attractive enough to have any man you wanted, so you offered yourself to every passerby. You made shrines for yourself and decorated them with some of your clothes. That’s where you took your visitors to have sex with them. These things should never have happened! You made idols out of the gold and silver jewelry I gave you, then you sinned by worshiping those idols. You dressed them in the clothes you got from me, and you offered them the olive oil and incense I gave you. I supplied you with fine flour, olive oil, and honey, but you sacrificed it all as offerings to please those idols. I … watched this happen.
Here’s another crock of fresh bullshit delivered by the right wing of the Republican Party (which has become, so far as I can see, the only wing of the Republican Party): the richer rich people get, the more jobs they create. Really? I have a total payroll of about 60 people, most of them working for the two radio stations I own in Bangor, Maine. If I hit the movie jackpot—as I have, from time to time—and own a piece of a film that grosses $200 million, what am I going to do with it? Buy another radio station? I don’t think so, since I’m losing my shirt on the ones I own already. But suppose I did, and hired on an additional dozen folks. Good for them. Whoopee-ding for the rest of the economy.

As I grew up, life wasn’t as beautiful as it is today and many of the traumatizing issues arose as God begins to heal my heart and soul. When time of healing begins, for most people who have been abandoned, either literally by actual physical absence, or emotionally—a parent can be in the home and not there for us—the abandoned child syndrome may remain years later, showing up through insecurities and fears, clinging behaviors or its opposite—walls to intimacy. Many people in therapy or in a writing-as-healing classes discover stories that surprise them—stories about the mistakes they felt their parents made, power imbalances in the family, or stories about physical or sexual abuse.
To complete my project, I traveled to Varanasi, India, for a week and had the most incredible experience of my life. I interviewed women microfinance clients from small, remote villages around Varanasi to evaluate the impact that Grameen Foundation’s Microsavings Initiative at CASHPOR has had on their life. After that, I chose five women to participate in a small film about the microsavings program, with the purpose of showing the world the important role that microfinance and microsavings play in the fight against poverty.

For those with a religious/faithful bent, “Let he who is without sin, cast the first stone!” I’m NOT so I won’t be casting any stones. I live by the motto, “To Each His Own!” Everyone makes their choices and lives their lives. As long as it doesn’t hurt anyone, it’s not any of my business. Yes, I intervene when I witness bullying. But otherwise, we are all free to live as we choose. And, like the old man’s scars, our differences make the world a more interesting place to live!

It appears that as feared, the murderer of Norwegians is to be used as a poster boy for the anti-European agenda of the international one world order. Just as the Germans were libelled for crimes they did not commit (such as the fake Holycaust), and made to pay reparations to those who destroyed their country, so it seems the victims of the Zionist atrocity in Oslo are to be used to silence criticism of the Zionist multi-culti State.
Recently my parents have moved house, meaning that I had to clear out my bedroom. It’s quite sad going through all the things you have gathered throughout your life and deciding what stays and what goes into the bin. One thing that I was delighted to see again were all my mixtapes that I made from the radio- I must have had 20 that I could find and along with compilation CD’s that I and my friends made. Instantly you are transported back to a place where the music really meant something, well it must have as I as really strict about what went into my mixtape!

Luckily, I have a strong support group of friends and family who were there for me through every step of my recovery, even through a semester I took off from school. I also had a great therapist who spent months working with me, teaching me that I do have control over my own life and that things don’t have to be so bad. Thanks to her, I was able to return to JMU after a semester off ready to take on the world.

Shortly after the nine mile mark my family was waiting for me. It is amazing what a brief moment of cheering from them can do for my morale. With a high five and only four miles to go, I felt like I had it in the bag. Except I didn't. I hit a wall right around the 10 mile mark. Not surprising at all, my longest training run was 10 miles, and my mid week runs were much shorter than they should have been. Again, it was having Dani by my side that kept me going. I mean, I couldn't let her beat me by too much, could I? :o) The next two miles went by really slowly. I felt like every step was a struggle. But I couldn't give up.

But The Clock is more than just a record of this astonishing fact – it is, I would argue, a distillation of our modern world’s collective wisdom about time captured on-screen; a patchwork history of film that celebrates our efforts to document, understand and enjoy the times we live in. Spanning many genres, periods and nationalities, it is ultimately an affirmation of the work of millions of people who have made it possible for us to leave behind such a rich record of real and imagined human life.

Time to dig out some photos from the archives, all taken with the old Canon A1 in the days before digital photography:
If the Muslim population of a country were to peak at, say, 1% of the total, it could perhaps be ignored. After all, Nazism is also a murderous, totalitarian ideology, but its continuing presence in European countries does not appear to be an existential threat to them. However, as is well known, Muslim birth rates are significantly higher than those of non-Muslims throughout Europe. No pernicious ideology (Communism, Nazism, etc.) that has afflicted Europe in recent history has benefited from this dynamic. Yet it is a dynamic of massive implications.
If you are paying attention you may recall that in my opening sentence I asserted that Twitter is lateral as well as linear. Even better, the lateral can link back into the linear in serendipitous ways. A couple of days ago a random retweet threw up a perfect example of this by leading me to a blogpost by Mack Collier (@MackCollier) entitled “You will fail at social media.” Intrigued, I read on – and I thoroughly recommend that you do too. Embedded in the post is a video of a TED lecture from Sir Ken Robinson whose 15-minute presentation on why education matters posits that creativity demands we have to dare to fail in order to succeed. This short video has radically altered my thinking about my childrens’ education and training and education in the company I help to run. I can't recommend it highly enough. Sir Ken’s thesis observes that children dare to fail until adults educate that courage out of them – and that this traditional approach to education is disastrous in the context of the global creative economy we live and work in.
Although this is the second pumpkin-related recipe here on the blog, I have to admit that before this year, I used to avoid pumpkin like the plague. No joke. I guess I had bad memories of how pumpkin tasted like - my mom used to stir fry it with some soupy substance which till today I have no idea what it is. No thank you. I guess it's also a sign that my tastebuds are maturing somewhat - I used to think brinjals (aubergines) were icky too, but I've come to accept them, same for salted egg yolks and sweet potatoes. I still don't really like bitter gourds except when cooked in an omelette though.

Not wanting to do more 6+ hour long runs I decided to do just enough training to get through the Quad. I planned on shorter long runs, 14-20 milers, with more intensity to make up for the lack of distance. Last weekend I ran the 25k of PCTR's Stinson Beach 50k and the weekend before that, the 33k race of PCTR's Muir Beach 50k with great success. This is success measured in the amount of fun I had and the whoop ass I dealt, mainly to myself. Fun + enough intensity = successful race.

A fast boat takes you two hours away from Bali and onto the Gilli islands. There are three tiny Gill’s; Gilli meno, Gilli air and Gilli trawangan. One is for family, the other made up of empty spaces that promise of seclusion and romance is the Gilli for honeymooners. And the third Gilli is Party Island, where everything that grows naturally, hear magic mushrooms and marijuana is legal. There are plenty of signboards promising you a trip to the moon and back, if you would just add some mushrooms on your pizza or into your milkshake.
Still, I knew nothing of the man P. G. Wodehouse, except what I read on the back of some book or another, and then all I learned was he really did love Pekingese dogs, which appear in so many of his stories. The full story is fascinating, and McCrum has told it beautifully.

“I’m running for president in the Republican Party, I’m doing very well. And last time they wondered about it, but, you know the whole thing is, is boy the people are really frustrated,” he said at the time. “You go to New Hampshire there are more independents than Republicans or Democrats.”
Ma had her hands full; a baby added to the mix of four older children, a large house to care for, meals to cook, water to haul, Indians to worry about, lessons to be taught, illnesses to doctor, cows to milk, chickens to tend and very importantly, trees to plant. Jessie wrote, “My mother went bravely about it to plant trees and flowers only to meet with repeated failures, the trees died out and the flowers never bloomed.” Even now, tree planting is a risky business. Just one summer of continual 100 degree temperatures, day after day, can wreck havoc on any orchard in Kansas. I digress….
Two companies currently operating in Sierra Leone were specifically singled out in the report. Quifel International Holdings, a Portuguese owned firm acquired nearly 130,000 acres of land in northern Sierra Leone, cultivating everything from oilseed to pineapple, sugarcane, mango, etc. The other is a Swiss owned renewable energy subsidiary — ADDAX & ORYX GROUP. ADDAX is reported to have leased 20,000 hectares of land in Bombali district, also in northern Sierra Leone, growing sugar cane for ethanol production. These operations were set up with lofty promises of employment opportunities for people, and accountability for a responsible use of the land, but the realities on the ground, after just a few years of operations has been disappointing. A June 2011 land deal brief by the Oakland Institute accused ADDAX of employing only about 200 people, with no dedicated monthly salaries, benefits, or job security after promises to employ 4,000 people. In the case of Quifel, it claimed that villagers were hired only as casual laborers, and paid less than two dollars a day for a period of only a month, after which they are let go. It also promised to provide stable employment for thousands of Sierra Leoneans as part of its acquisition agreement.

Can it be a generational issue too? It’s possible. I had a lunch with an older professional, and she posed the question of if there’s a negative effect of having too many LinkedIn connections, or too many facebook friends. Is there such thing as ‘too many’? Does the number show the reach you have, or that you’re a networking whore? I never looked at it that way before. But it seems to be many older professionals have that perspective. But I think that’s a totally different conversation.

Prime Ministerial PMQs and statements aside, probably the time has come for those in the Real Opposition to assess who will be next in the firing line across these three dangerously interwoven sectors of our public life: the media, the police, and the politicians. Somewhere in there lies the full strength of how the law has been flouted, and the Constitution perverted, by all three in various ways since around the turn of the century. But some very determined investigators are going to have to take on some very powerful interests to enjoy any real depth of success in such a thankless mission. Jailing Coulson is going to seem a fairly straightforward process by comparison.

There was a room I didn’t get to see when I visited, devoted to the “Lost Battalion,” that is, the 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery. This Battalion was detached from the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas National Guard during World War II, and wound up in Java, where it was captured by the Japanese. The men of the Battalion were forced into slavery, and worked in Japan, Burma, and Thailand. The Battalion earned its nickname because nobody in the US heard a word about the Battalion for almost three years.
This is where we need to pump the breaks. As much as we want to dive into things, we can’t. We cannot expect ourselves to continue whatever it may be for a long period of time. We will simply get burned out. Taking a step back will also help to understand these items, hobbies, or habits aren’t permanent. These aren’t vital to our character. These aren’t vital to our personality.

Ewan is the atypical warrior male. Mairin is the spirited female. They are a match in every way that is right. Banks delivers these characters to have tension, fury between them and not to mention passion. They heat up the pages with their sexual scenes but what I like the most is how defiant Maririn is too her warrior husband. She keeps him on his toes which is enjoyable to read.

The study reveals that film stars are no longer considered to be larger than life in terms of his or her persona and lifestyle; they are now real individuals who have risen to extraordinary heights. This shift in how celebrities are viewed is largely attributed to the availability of more real time, wide spread knowledge of what the stars do off screen – be it television shows, blogs, news controversies, or activism. While celebrities were once virtual prisoners of the characters that they played on-screen, they are now seen as individuals whose personal traits earn them as much admiration as their display of talent on-screen. His real attitudes and his larger life story is where the opportunities for brands lie.

As the game developed around the country schools got tired of playing against themselves and decided to expand their horizons and start playing against other schools with football teams in the region/area. The 1st ever game between two schools took place in the state of New Jersey on November 6th 1869 when Rutgers and Princeton Universities. The two schools located just 37. 1 miles away from each other developed a series and became rivals. The following year Columbia University joined the series which prompted Yale University and Stevens Institute of Technology to form a league or an early type of conference.

This is a bit of an odd post, as I started by wondering what needed to change for D&D in early modern, and it became clear LOTFP is already there. However, how do you feel about ditching the traditional view of domain rulership and conquest for sliding D&D play into a setting themed against a later age? I've always like knowing there's an "end-game" out there, where D&D crosses over into a different style of play and there's a natural point for retiring characters.

Milestone #2. For the first time ever, I climbed over 100 stories on the StairMaster! I wish there was more of a story to go along with this, but there isn’t. I got on the StairMaster, threw a towel over the display, and started climbing. I had some great music, and before I knew it, I had climbed 75 stories, and I decided in that moment to that I’d push myself to get over 100. I had been close before – my last outing on a StairMaster resulted in a 98-story climb – but today I went 104. HOLY FUCKING SHIT, I CLIMBED 104 STORIES! It took 22 minutes and I burned 375 calories.

It’s funny that I just began reading a book about this very theme — The Culturally Savvy Christian by Dick Staub.

And if culture is important to God, shouldn’t it be important to the Church too?

Of the many techniques I learned from studying film and scriptwriting, my favorite is “enter late, leave early.” This means your scene is really just a middle slice out of a sequence of events (i.e. it does not contain all the events).
The fourth leg (sat-ya) still has significant potency in the fourth age, the age of Kali. It endures even in adverse conditions because it is the principle, most durable, powerful leg of morality.

I received a comment yesterday that got me thinking. A woman told me that her three daughters were well behaved and she implied my kids act up because of my lazy parenting. I really don't think she was trying to be mean. I think she simply doesn't understand that not all kids are the same and it's not all about the parenting, but about the kids and their different personalities as well. Anyway, I started thinking about this and in all honesty, if I only considered my three daughters, I probably wouldn't have much material for this blog. They're well behaved. I don't have problems with them. Now, I'm not saying that boys are bad or that I don't like my boys or anything remotely like that, but I will say that my boys are the root of the behavior issues in this house 99% of the time. Jackson has ADHD and can't take meds because they cause high blood pressure for him. Until you've spent a day with a kid whose brain doesn't have that little switch that makes them stop and think before they act, you can't begin to presume I'm a lazy parent. And Clay hasn't had any official diagnosis, but I'd bet big money that he has it too. I have six kids and they're all VERY different. They all have their own personalities. And they all react differently to instruction. I'm not getting into all this here because I've already written about it in my book. I did want to talk about judging others though.
Live CD from the 2-nights of bands, b-movies, bar-b-q and beer known as Sleazefest '94 that took place at Local 506 in Chapell Hill, North Carolina.This is the official CD recording of the inaugural Sleazefest in Chapel Hill, North Carolina which took place late August 1994. Organized by Rick Miller of Southern Culture on The Skids as an answer to all the “lollapalooza” and “woodstock ‘94″ type festivals happening that year, he assembled a who’s who of trash rock, rockabilly, and garage rock, called it Sleazefest, and held it at a local BBQ joint. Just listening to this you can tell this must have been one hell of a party, and I guarantee you there was more than one guitar neck covered in BBQ sauce fingerprints before this was over. - A Truer Sound

One thing that really surprised me was that Lyssa really took the time to get to know me personally, we made a connection. This connection carried over into the classroom and really help unify our message to the course participants. By the second day we were co-training like a well-oiled machine. Lyssa is a great coach/mentor too, she took the time to explain the reasoning behind almost everything that she was doing. Not only did I get her message, but I got the meaning behind it as well. I learned so many facilitation tools and techniques for working with teams, it was great.

I can not say enough the devil will attack you but don’t worry you have the most powerful God, on your side… The reason I am mentioning this again about the Devil is because for the last year I went through some very rough times and the Devil attacked me in many ways to the point I actually fell away from having a relationship with God, because I felt alone and I also felt that God, was with drawing him self from me when actually it was a delusion from the Devil and I fell for it because I let my faith become weak…

It's a lovely afternoon here today, I think that Spring is definitely just around the corner now......I can't wait ! So, onto the card I'm sharing with you today. It's my big sis's birthday tomorrow, I'm confident she won't look here, so I'm safe to show you !

Until today, that is. That little store must have an aura that draws me in – or maybe I’m a glutton for punishment. In any case, I went in, and bought: half a melon, some cherry tomatoes, 2 pieces of baklava and a small jar of home-made strawberry jam. I did not ask if it was his granny or himself who made it. But I really wanted to.

Led by an ichthyologist and an entomologist graduate students, the first stop for this group was a classroom-like setting where we were treated to amber, flies, ants and stained fishes. Sweet. I got to hold a piece of Baltic amber that encases a pair of flies that are still in the heat of copulation. Pretty rad. There was also amber that encases a species of previously undescribed ant. That guy has a massive pair of mandibles. We also spent some time looking at stained fishes under the microscope, although the staining technique itself is sufficient to show the complexity of fish osteology. "Fish bones are jigsaw puzzle from hell". Yep, that pretty much sums it up along with articulating a snake. The staining technique uses red dye to color the bones and blue dye to color the cartilage. Here's a writeup on how to prepare a stained fish Hidden Blades, Glowing Scorpions and Bug Genitalia: Great Science Images From the American Museum of Natural History.

In the spring, though, I had an idea for a narrative non-fiction book, personal and of-the-moment, which is something else I've always wanted to write. Madame Agent liked the idea, and wanted a detailed proposal. *insert more life and distraction* Additional time has passed, but here I am writing again, with new verve for the non-fiction idea. It's what I've been working on.

Ben talks to Kacie’s dad and he is basically like “dump her now” because he doesn’t want her to get hurt unless it is him chaining her to her bed and making her practice baton twirling. It got mad awkward balls because Ben was doing his “I’m on the fence” thing and he was like “get off the fence and go back to California” kind of thing. In fact, he later tells Kacie that he doesn’t want her moving to California and if she does she better not move in with him. I wanted to know if Mom and Dad slept in separate beds. I just have a feeling they do.

One day a new clipboard lady comes to see your mum and dad. You see them cry and decide you don't like this clipboard lady, you wonder where the clipboard lady you remember has gone. Mummy and Daddy are sad so you hug them then fling yourself to the floor and scream so the clipboard lady will go away. It works so next time you decide to scream louder and kick your feet harder to be sure she'll go before your mum and dad cry.

Making the deaths all the more tragic, perhaps, is that many are a result of forgetfulness rather than neglect, occurring when distracted but otherwise responsible parents or caretakers inadvertently leave a child in the car.
Arguments that either, or both, of these categories are simply subsumed back into the culture industry - that this is a weak "critique" acting merely as a way for capitalist hegemony to innoculate against real critique - may be true. But they miss a crucial point, which is that audiences never consume these works in a vacuum. This is sometimes referred to as the "hypodermic needle" model of mass culture, wherein the mindless unwashed simply take in whatever bad shit the corporations sell them - McDonald's, Two and a Half Men, and so on. To put it another way, critics of mass culture from this viewpoint presumptively project onto the lumpen masses a condition of pure and uninhibited spectatorship, ... i.e., recreating in fact the very modernist ideal of the immersive, mainlined gaze seen in something like Anthology Film Archives' Invisible Cinema. But whereas something like the Invisible Cinema was an elective practice for society's aesthetes, the hypodermic needle funhouse is a prison. Recto or verso, what "haunts" these conceptions of media consumption is the fantasy of erasure of the viewing-listening subject, and the elaboration of this same subject as answerable to the mediated mechanics of ideology (as in cybernetics, another field of inquiry whose heyday was roughly contemporaneous with the height of avant-garde Western cinema as well as hypodermic needle masscult theory). The subject becomes, indeed, subject-to.

I gave in and pulled out my headphones halfway up. As I rounded the last corner and saw a group of vehicles, and the orange coolers that all the other aid stations were using, I got excited. Again, both Phil and Coach David had told me that it was mostly downhill from AS #4, and even better, the AS was there! I got out quickly, opting not to linger, but within a quarter mile realized the dirt in my shoes was going to be a problem, and my toes were hitting the front of my shoe consistently. This was shifting my gate, which wasn’t something I wanted to continue. I thought back on everything I know about what I have done wrong in the past, the first of which is figuring I will grin an bear issues to the point it drags me down so instead I stopped, and made the adjustments. Before I knew it I was moving again and I was passing people! I was making up time, and people I thought I would be with for the rest of the race were falling far behind. As I crossed mile 20, the 50 mile front runner came tearing up the hill looking really strong. I felt good, looked at my watch, and in the low 4 hour range, I realized I might be able to come in under 5 hours. As though that wasn’t enough, I was feeling at home, like all my other worries were irrelevant here. I felt like this is where I belong, this is where no matter how hard it may feel at times, amazing things happen inside each of us. Running through the trees above theArkansasValleybelow was just what my soul needed.

I woke up friday morning thinking about what I learn this past year about what were the most important things, what I loved and cherished, what brought me Joy and Peace. Beyond my spiritual beliefs , I most cherish my Child- My Home and My State. I just happen to live where the Cardinal is the state bird and when I look up from my desk theres a crepe myrtle tree and many many times theres a Cardinal there eating or just perched on the limb.. It may be fanciful thinking but I believe they're here to bring me a special message or just to remind me of what I love and to stop a moment and take Joy in it as I go about my day.
To be continued tomorrow.
I went into the store specifically wanting to find a few certain items to try on and this was one of them. I fell in love with the cute polka dot pattern when I saw this top online, and in real life, it did not disappoint. It was every bit as cute! I tried this on in an X-Small and it fit perfectly. The front is a bit shorter than the back but after staring at myself in the mirror for a good 5 minutes I decided it was long enough. If I really wanted to, I could slip a white tank or cami underneath for a little extra length and I think it would still look really cute, but I think it's fine without it too. I could have sized up to a small for a bit more length, but it would have been way too boxy and baggy on me. The X-Small was the only way to go for me. This top also comes in a few solid colors. I loved the coral color and would love to grab it when it hits sale. The material of this top is light and airy, and probably a little susceptible to wrinkling, but I love it nonetheless. It was a no-brainer. To the cashier it went and in my closet it now hangs.

The reason I chose this picture for repetition is because there is repetition throughout this whole image; although they may be doing different things on each side, it is clear that every individual image within this still has a counterpart on the opposite side. For example, the women at the top on both sides of the swords, the women wit the water bowls, the red scarfs falling, the woman and man fighting with swords, the women with the goat horns, and the two women crawling on the floor towards the center. The picture, although it does appear to be visually heavy through out uses a uniform background in the entire shot. The pillars and colums and walls are the same on both sides. The colors are also being repeated. This shot only contains very dark, gold rustic colors, with the exception of the light being shown on Kanye West and the light sky in the back of the pillars. The idea of the body in its natural form is also being repeated, hince all the people execpt Kanye west are either completely naked or have a a small piece of clothing on. The use of women are also being repeated, there is only two men in the entire picture.

Don’t worry. If you read the excerpt and didn’t really think it was story-ish enough for you, the whole thing is actually a story. Just a short one. With a pamphlet inside. There’s characters and plot and such.You just got to read the beginning of that pamphlet. It’s complicated I know, but that’s just what I felt like writing. Those things happen from time to time.
I actually have a huge smile plastered on my face this week thanks to the amazing review copies I got this week. I started Pretty Amy the other day and have been thoroughly enjoying it and don’t let the pretty cover fool you, it’s quite a funny book, but also goes a lot deeper than that. Lisa Burstein will be stopping by on May 29th to discuss her debut novel so make sure you drop by.

Chavez doesn't start his Sinfonía Romántica with anything Latin, Indian, Mexican, or American. Rather, the English horn presents a puzzling, tonally ambiguous melody that will resurface throughout the symphony. Across this clip (recording by Enrique Bátiz and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), but especially with the repeated short-long-long trumpet figure toward the end, I do sense the kind of starkness to which Bernstein may have been referring:

As Loretta and I passed by the Stanton’s, the kids were standing in their small yard. As we no longer had anything to do with them, there was an air of hostility. Anyway, words were exchanged between me and one boy. More words ensued; about this time Mrs. Stanton came flying out the door, down her steps, off the bank into the road and was on me like a duck on a Junebug and flailing away at me. She beat my back while I was trying to escape and screaming ‘bloody murder’. Loretta stood by mute and stunned. I don’t quite remember what happened but Mrs. Stanton had quit and gone back into her house after she had “beaten me to a pulp”.
Moreover, McCormack provides a more fitting account of Barth’s clearly dialectical understanding of scripture and the Word of God. He takes seriously Barth’s tension, the being statements regarding scripture and the seemingly subjective, becoming statements, preventing either one to swallow the other whole. Barth seems to point in McCormack’s direction when he wrote, “The Bible, then, becomes God’s Word in this event, and in the statement that the Bible is God’s Word the little word ‘is’ refers to its being in this becoming . . . that it is God’s Word even in spite of our lack of faith.” In other words, scripture becomes what it already is even before we apprehend it.

All background and designer paper is from BasicGrey - Pyrus. I added distressing to most of the bare edges and sponged on some Memento Rich Cocoa ink to give this card a rough look. I used the sewing machine to attach the layers with all different stitch patterns. The main sentiment is a Stampin' Up! stamp called Happy Grad, and the small sentiment, "4 you" is from the Stampin' Up! set Tiny Tags. A Martha Stewart border punch was used to create the scalloped border, and the leaf and flower punches were Martha's as well. Seam binding was added and tied in a bow on the side. I paper pierced the top left corner to comply with the sketch. A large metal brad was added to the flower's center. To finish the card, I added the "key to success" at the bottom with the tiny tag tied on.

Second, the lawsuit implies that medical information is a perfect system. That test results are never accidentally mixed up. That testing is black and white in the first place. That a definitive diagnosis can always be made. It simply is not that way. This suit requires physicians to be right, every time, with every diagnosis, or they are at the mercy of the legal system.

Branney's skill as a director are on full display; Troy Sterling Nies' score is his best work yet; Matt Foyer's physical performance reminded me of the best of Dwight Frye while his unique vocal delivery pulled me into the film's story effortlessly. This was an ambitious production, and everyone delivered.

No matter what our own relationship is with food, our children are born with their own particular set of taste buds, metabolism, sensitivities and tolerances. Our children are born with their own preferences and those preferences expand as our children explore the world and try new things. We can try and make our children eat according to our schedule and expectations, our own preferences and sensitivities. We can try to brainwash our children so that they believe exactly the same things we do about food and nutrition and health. We can try to control and manipulate our children's relationship with food. On the other hand, we can accept our children for who they are. We can respect that they are a different people than we are and what they eat, how and when they eat it, may be drastically different. We can aim to be a Family of Connected Individuals in regards to food as well. We can also remember that our children are going to be in the world, playing at friends' houses, going to school, visiting relatives, shopping in stores, and they are going to be exposed to a wide variety of foods, as well as a lot of different information and ideas about diet and nutrition. They are going to have the opportunity to make choices about food, even if we never give them choices at home.

Hawkeye, on the other hand, doesn't really work outside the context of the Avengers. People have tried, certainly: he's even developed a small but respectable solo rogues gallery, mostly composed of people from Clint Barton's past who have a mad-on for whatever reason. But he doesn't have any projects, any real reason to operate, outside his team. He doesn't have Green Arrow's social conscience to propel his characterization. Hawkeye grew up a poor orphan, a boy who literally ran away to join the circus and learned everything he needed at the feet of some extremely dubious characters. For Hawkeye, being an Avenger is the best job in the world, certainly more than almost anyone else in his position could ever have dreamed of accomplishing. Whenever he's left the team - to have his own "hard traveling hero" moments, or to gain perspective on whatever recent setback he suffered - it's always been temporary, and often when he's left the main Avengers group it's been for the purpose of founding or joining another group, such as the West Coast Avengers or the Thunderbolts.
The first time I called I got some guy who was completely exasperated at my utter ignorence on the subject of liquor licensing. He was ok excecpt for the fact that he couldn't keep his contempt for my stupidity out of his voice. His answers were short and if the answer to "Do I need this form?" was no, he never offered up what form it was that I needed. So then I'd ask. It was like tennis. It was draining.... For both of us I imagine... This lead me to hang up without asking one last question.
I do try to use my truth, though, my understanding of my essential shortcomings (perhaps, words are slippery, I could say sins and that too would be accurate but sins are done willfully and while I willingly allowed myself to be do and have and now have to deal with the stain on my soul, I did not willfully set out to show myself the fragile human that I am and yet I have and here I am) drives the philosophic voice that chooses the words that defines the course of the flow of my awareness.

She felt his garments move over her exposed flesh one second, then the next, his lips brushed hers, a gentle caress of skin against skin as if she were a china doll he could easily break. Maybe he could. She had heard talk of their strength, beyond that of any human. With his hands braced on the chair on either side of her, his mouth traveled, a light kiss on her chin, a nibble without fangs on her neck, the draw of his tongue over the skin above her breasts. Her tight nipples rose up to meet him as she fought for breath.

More properties of the crack are beginning to manifest. It is growing and has broken in to The Byzantium. The Angels are at first fascinated by it, then frightened by it. It is bleeding light and energy from the end of the universe. The Doctor, River, and Bishop Octavian go in search of the bridge of the ship, leaving Amy with the clerics. The light from the crack grows and the clerics go to investigate one-by-one, and one-by-one they are erased from time and memory. It is hard to not see patterns emerge, not merely for series five, but taking in to account elements that are going to emerge in series six. I’ll hold off discussing that for now. I also wonder if Moffat is at all familiar with Lovecraft. The previous episode had a book written by a madman. This episode had Amy communicating with a cleric as he went to investigate the crack. She speaks to him on the communicator, but we never see his death. Somewhat reminiscent of The Statement of Randolph Carter. Although, Moffat may have little to no knowledge of Lovecraft. Lovecraftian elements have so infiltrated modern horror and sci-fi that a writer can use those elements and not even know it.

Criminals always lie about their actions to avoid punishment for their crimes.
Love, when it comes down to it, is not defined by gender, nor is gender defined by love. Love, in my experience, resists definition. It is without boundary, without pretense, without externally-imposed rules. Love makes the rules.
For the most part, I liked the writing. I thought it was poetic, dreamy, and subtle. It captured the somber tone of the book well. But, but...and this may just be me, but I cannot stand when authors overuse participle phrases. And this author used them more than necessary and in places where they didn't belong. It yanks you right out of the narrative and ruins the magic. For you non-editor folks who are wondering what a participle phrase is, here is an example:

The makers of this game were influenced by the popular claw game at casinos. The installation required the players to use a foot-pedal and gear-knob to control the claw in real time. It is one of the most advanced projection mapping I have seen lately. Players have to pick up the Chevy Sonic to win the car. People who pick up the gift boxes instead of the car win some cool prize other than the car of course. I wonder if any of these other prizes involved a track day or a visit to the factory to see how the car is made, basically a prize that engages the users to find out more about the car effortlessly and makes it easier for them to take decision to buy the car. Financial prizes involving price – off, reduced interest rates etc. will certainly help to gain customers.

Over the last few weeks I have been gathering items for redoing / updating our living room area. After having the same color scheme for four years- I felt it was high time I implemented a few changes to the palette. I still love earth tone colors, browns and greens especially- so I decided to keep them and add in splashes of bright colors to really bring some life into the room.

I am pretty confident I'd get 2 good days and maybe a third less impressive day out of this sort of set.
I’m trying to stay in the moment and not worry about next week and the fact that I only have like 2 or 3 appointments meaning that I’ll have more extra time which is usually not good at all. I guess, once again, we’ll just see how it all plays out.
Let’s say you need to get some work done right now even though you haven’t exceeded your “Maximum Time Allowed.” Thankfully StayFocusd gives you “The Nuclear Option” which lets you block sites for the number of hours you indicate. If I know I need to get some work done in the next three hours, I’ll “Nuke” my time-wasting sites so that I have less distractions preventing me from getting things done.

This story has two settings, Lanzarote and the planet Sarn. The former features some great location shooting and allows the viewer the opportunity to see Peri in a bikini. Other than introducing Peri, the Lanzarote setting does not actually play much of a role in developing the plot. The volcanic, desert planet of Sarn also features some nice camerawork, even if its society is not very well sketched. Superstitious people who want to sacrifice people to their god are not exactly original in Dr Who.

In some instances the reader is prompted to adopt the spiritual quest of the speaker. Such as in in “Confessions of a Song and Dance Man” where the speaker proclaims, “A God-fearing agnostic,/ I tend to look in the corner of things,/ Those-out-of-the-way places,/ The half-dark and half-hidden,/ the passed-by and the overlooked,/ Whenever I want to be sure I can’t find something./ I go out of my way to face them and pin them down.”

I find the notion that these old games are being released without translation, from a prior rerelease, one at a time for $9.99. Perhaps Capcom realized it could have made a lot more money if it hadn’t released the Mega Man Anniversary Collection (all 8 of the first games on PS2 disk) about five years earlier. Although I still consider it fun to go and waste an hour playing through these old adventures every once in awhile, I can start to see where things went wrong with this series. Hopefully Capcom will get back on track before it’s too late.
I bought a set of dirtbike/racing cars stamps yesterday - it's nothing like I would normally buy but my 4 year old and 2 year old were with me and begged and begged to get them, and I had a rare parenting moment of weakness and decided that I probably would get a fair bit of use out of them...and if not, I have no doubt that my boys will use them over and over again. At $6.95 for a big set of many stamps, it didn't break the bank. My 4 y.o. couldn't believe his luck (I hardly ever say yes!) and he held the stamps the whole way home looking at them and telling me about them and how he can't wait to make a card when he gets home! Will post a pic of his card later.

I took Dave to Paris for the weekend as a surprise for his 40th birthday last year, it was the first time either of us had been and we loved it. Also the first time we have both been away from the children for two nights...it was so relaxing, and such a beautiful city, The Louvre, The Eiffel Tower, The Arch de Triumph, Notre Dame Cathedral, all amazing.
Now that I'm a stay-at-home mom I have a lot more time to cook and bake. If I'm craving something, I've really enjoyed having the time and energy to whip it up. Back when I worked, when I got home around 6 p.m. it was hard to have the energy or motivation to whip up something. Now I start my dinners mid-afternoon and have usually already eaten by 6 p.m. It's great!

She noticed the ever-present protesters on the other side of the street. One of them, a young woman, was carrying an infant in a baby carrier on her back. The baby had a thick tuft of blond curly hair that begged to be looked at her. Her face reminded her Tori of a Pampers’ box.

The raid tonight follows raids on Saturday, during which soldiers arrested 16 year-old Anan Tamimi from his bed at gunpoint shortly after midnight. He was then taken to the nearby military base. He was then released with no further explanation at the entrance to the military base at 4 in the morning while still blindfolded and cuffed.
We chatted during the day, and she asked me what her carriers name was.. And instantly, I thought of fireworks.. But you cant call a baby carrier Fireworks, can you?? (Well, I did have a friend once long ago who wanted to call his first-born Stairwell... hmmm interesting hey? What a freakster!)

5. Although the indication of product given in connection with a RCD does not affect the scope of protection, it can be used to determine the product used in various parts of the "overall impression" test, such as the "design freedom" subtest. However, where there is a particular category of products within a broad category defined by the "indication of product", this also can be used, as the Board did in this case (Decision paras 59-60). Applicants will therefore need to give a little thought to indications of products in future, as we have thought possible since OHIM Appeal Decision R 1421/2006-3, the Cash Register case.

It is fair to say that over the last decade I have observed a steady improvement in law firm management and in partner behaviour and discipline. Nevertheless, there is huge room for efficiency gains in just about every law firm in the UK. In addition, the way in which partners manage their people, their time and their priorities is in some cases embarrassingly poor. There are a few Private Equity Houses which are interested in investing in the legal sector and most of them see the imposition of strong management and appropriate accountabilities and discipline to be one of the key areas where they can add value with a view to gaining a return on investment. For the last fifty years or more, lawyers have led a fairly cosy existence with high profits continuing to accrue from traditional working practices and comfortable work ethics. The brutal truth is that these comfort zones are shrinking fast, and the firms who have acted quickly to bring about efficiencies and accountabilities are steadily gaining both in profitability and in the ability to compete.

I get the impression that parish life has been quite decimated in the United Kingdom. Community centres used to be the focus of the community, that is, the parish community. Nowadays, they're just rented out to weird Tai Chi groups and Yogi masters. People can go to Mass and never know anyone there but for a few they have talked to. Perhaps it is another strange failure of the fruits of the Second Vatican Council. Perhaps Mass has taken 'centre-stage' as being the 'entertainment' and 'community bonding' session. That would be a strange knock-on effect, wouldn't it? All that working for 'justice and peace' but no bingo and no fun.

For the first two lines, the chorus sounds like a power pop song, but the words are unusual and it could definitely be compared to Jonathan Richman. On the third line of the chorus, though, the song suddenly opens up into this post-progressive, hard rock/pop mode with overdubbed keyboards, power chords, and drum fills.

I have to say that this new mall is incredible. I had more fun "people watching" than actually shopping. All of the pictures were taken on a cell phone (i.e. and they blow). I really wished that I had taken my "Bad Boy Camera" but the day wasn't about me and my hobby.
The evenness of the lines and regularity of the motifs is not up to my usual standard... but everything withstanding I like the representation of 'things earthy'.

Quite a buzz has built up about this film pre-release in the media devoted to the horror genre and I have to confess to catching some this enthusiasm myself, so when it opened I got myself straight down to local multiplex. This film was made a few years ago by MGM but when they went bust a lot of their projects got frozen. Fortunately Lionsgate took over the distribution of this film so we all finally get to see it. Written by director Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon, it has a lot of the witty dialogue you’d expect if you are familiar with Whedon’s TV shows. This review will be short because I don’t want to give any spoilers. Avoid the trailer if you can but it is probably too late for that

I told my massage lady last night that it was one of the worst days of my life. (continuing with my dramatic theme) I think I even punched my steering wheel on the way home. I felt sad for my little G man. I even started being hard on myself, blaming me for his cold because I wasn't able to nurse him for a year. I know a lot of sick breastfed babies and a lot of healthy formula fed babies, but whatever. I even cried a little bit while I was brushing my teeth last night.

When you enter the dojo, when your Sensei gives you instructions on what techniques to carry out, when your Sensei corrects you, you respond with Osu in a clear and affirmative voice. You are saying that you will do as they have instructed without delay. You will not do something outside of that scope.

-Comment: A young boy barefeet in buckskin Lederhosen with H-style suspenders (pictured). Only this very short scene. One even younger boy in pants with suspenders and some other boys, mostly in long black, maybe cotton pants. Some sailors at the beginning and end, also a brief scene with a boy in sailor suit. Nothing more is shown. Some young men have long collar flaps. One collar (medium length) is shown at close up, but the man is much older (gray hair). Also some altar boys (red/white clothing).
The biggest thing I'll take away from the book, the element that will stick with me the most, is the incredible set-piece imagery, some of which wouldn't seem out of place in a Lord of the Rings film. I think certain 'snapshots' from the book are forever imprinted on my memory, they're so unforgettable. The great twin mountain peaks at sunrise. A wounded bull elephant charging through the trees (there are scenes of elephant hunting in the book, by the way, but as with the outdated race issues it would be unfair to judge Haggard too harshly for it). Key moments from the tribal war. The moment when the trio first enter the Kukuana Place of Death (that was perhaps the most memorable scene of all for me). I mean... wow. I'm actually glad that no decent film adaptation of the book has ever been made, because now I'm not tempted to watch it. It'd take a damn fine movie to match up to the pictures in my mind! Perhaps I should write to Peter Jackson...

Inversion is one of those games that hit me out of leftfield when I first saw footage of it earlier this year. It certainly looked interesting and the gravity based gun play seemed like it could be fun. Unfortunately while this may turn out to be the case the gameplay on offer here didn’t really sell me on the game. Not to mention the fact that graphically it was quite poor, with lots of jagged edges and pop in. Fingers crossed the full game gets more polish before release.

It might just be an entry luxury utility offering when it was not the used acura legend parts. Once the 1988 acura legend parts a new crossover sedan hatchback with coupe aspirations, a new chiseled taillight arrangement. Overall, the setup works remarkably well executed and in doing so it has only one unattractive feature: a puzzling set of Pirelli ice and snow radials mounted, it still felt a touch light and skittish in some situations you'd be hard pressed to hear or feel its presence. Gears shift automatically or with finger-tip actuated gearshift paddles. Its five gears are one short of the 1990 acura legend parts, the 92 acura legend parts is near sublime thanks to outstanding handling qualities that are mounted higher than previously, making them easier to read at a glance.

I’m originally from Miami, and grew up there in the days before air-conditioning. I appreciate a nice draft as welcome refreshment.

At first, the work was very interesting because I had no experience working in an actual research lab surrounded by actual scientists. I was eager to soak up knowledge and asked plenty of questions. When it came time for independent work and growing our own cultures I felt less motivated to do this because I excited to move on to the next stage of sequencing organisms. As such, I decided not to work with any of the organisms I found and I am hoping to work with an organism that was grown and isolated by the group.

This last weekend I took TJ and joined Danny on a high school ministry canoe trip on the colorado river where Danny and about 100 students and staff floated a 30 mile stretch over two days. Danny has been bugging me for years to come with him and this year I came as the Saturday night speaker and to scout out this experience for our own youth ministry too. (Which btw we are so doing! Dang I had fun with TJ and I think we're going to try and join Thrive and unite for next spring. Can't wait!) Anyway, in the process, I learned that Danny has been on this stretch of river for over 30 years. He started as a kid, then continued as a high school student himself, and now has kept the tradition going for the last 16+ years as a youth pastor.

Mitchell was an excellent constituency MP whose main political interest was the British Army. He was critical of the Army’s leadership. For example, in August 1970 he was quoted: ”… those bastards in Whitehall”. He was on the patriotic or traditional wing of the Conservative party and opposed British membership of the European Community(now the EU), sanctions against Rhodesia and the arms embargo on Israel. He was prominent in the Monday Club and the Anglo-Rhodesian Society. Mitchell was one of 39 Conservative rebels who defied the Party whip to vote against British entry to the EEC(EU) in the Commons vote on 28 October 1971.

Hohensalza, (now called Inowrocław) was in the county of Hohensalza in Prussia in the province of Posen (which is now Poland). The area of Hohensalza had a predominate population of Catholics, though there were some Protestants and a small minority of Jews. 36% of the citizens were German speakers, 64% Polish speakers in the 1930’s.

Saturday I got up early I wanted to see the Leopold Museum before heading to our opening at 11am (I am told this is not an unusual time for exhibition openings n Vienna). Being pressed for time I decided to just focus on looking at their Egon Schiele collection. I have always been a big fan of his work and I couldn’t let this chance to see so much of it pass me by. I was not disappointed his drawings have a fragile, intense beauty and I was happy to see his landscape/city paintings that were a complete surprise.

So I bring up the housing crisis to Conservative Cali Dude, who then proceeds to climb up on a 2-story soapbox and pontificate on the unfairness of the presumed bailout that's coming. Fact is, though, he's right. 5 or 6 years ago, when we were both still in Indianapolis, we talked about how utterly ridiculous the housing market was becoming and that there would be a serious correction coming. It wasn't if, it was when. And we were both right.

Today of course we see the rise of stage-managed nationalism, of simply a British form of neo-conservatism and coupled with this we see the management of Muslim anger, in a direction again at odds with Muslim betterment. Yet the forces that stir the brew remain scot-free, at liberty, whilst any that defend their people, their nation, of any colour or creed face the peril of the Hague or immediate death at the hands of the managed mob.
To summarize it may be asserted apple iphone is among the greatest pieces of technology and it is right now getting used by most of the people. Using the rise in need for this product, the actual demand for applications is equally increasing and thus searching for related iPhone Application Improvement companies becomes a difficult work.

Frank confirms that I am, in fact, human. Here, I begin to think that either Frank IS actually human and wants Brent and I out of the brig… or maybe he’s just realizing that by confirming two humans to be human, that he’s getting the humans to trust him more, whereas saying we’re both cylons would cause more conflict.

The cream needs to be infused with the spices overnight. Subsequently, after the custard is prepared, it has to be refrigerated overnight again. If you are the sort who can only manage one item per day, then you would need to get on with the sweet short crust pastry a day earlier. So much work? I think it will get more breezy after repeating this a couple more times, when the routine becomes more familiar. It is really not so difficult and the end result turns out really quite similar to what I ate at the store.For those who are not able to travel all the way to Sydney bakery for their treats, this is the greatest option available. And then, for those who are reluctant to pay AUS$5 per tart, you can save quite a few quids by making them yourself. The authenticity of the cookbook makes it a gem and because these treats are meant to look rustic, you can get away with a little shoddy workmanship and still look like a kitchen goddess.

I fallowed this ladies tutorial HERE on how to cover the tops of the jars with coffee filters... only I don't drink coffee and the filters are in my craft room for use with glitter. I stained mine with a bit of water, soy sauce and a squirt of an oil based dark walnut scratch repair liquid. (I had it on hand) I love how the oils and water don't mix... when you go to soak anything in there the oils at the top swirl around and take the the paper in different patters.

Models of the city exist, at many different levels of fidelity, for many different gaming scenarios. From the crude polygonal outlines of early iterations of Microsoft Flight Sim, to the normal-mapped biomorphic horrors of last year's ultraviolent brawler, Prototype, Manhattan's skyline and the districts beyond are etched into virtuality, over and over. These models exist on countless DVDs and hard-discs across the world, in ten of thousands of memory-states within the architecture of game consoles and PCs that are modeling the city right now, in real time. It might be impossible to say how many different (or identical) instances of New York are stored, digitally, within the city itself. It seems likely that a model of New York sits just an arm-length away from every Xbox-inhabited TV stand in the greater metropolitan area.
Senate Education Committee Chair Florence Shapiro called the budget of the Windham School District, which educates Texas prisoners at 112 prison units across the state, "the biggest waste of money I think I've seen," according to reports from the Austin Statesman and the Houston Chronicle. "With the state facing a massive shortfall, members of a Senate Finance subcommittee said they can no longer justify the $65 million a year in state revenue used by the Windham School District to provide approximately 5,200 high school equivalency certificates and other vocational training programs."
Smoked beers what to say about them. Well first of all most of the smoked beer I have seen available and have tried have been stouts and porters. This is not my favorite style of beer as I am more of a hop head. I am starting to expand my horizons in this area but taste buds change slowly. I bet you are asking where am I going with this. Well let me tell you adding smoke to a beer you are trying to get in to doesn't always help. For some beers like the Alaskan Smoked Porter the really light smokiness really compliments the porter. In many of the other smoked beers I have tried the smoke was way overpowering and added a different type of bitterness that wasn't pleasing to my pallet.

What Paul doesn’t mention in his tutorial is there are two types of polarizer filters: Linear and circular. Linear polarizer filters do not work well with digital cameras, so professional photographers recommend using circular polarizers instead. One other note, as with most things, you get what you pay for. They best advice I’ve found is that if your budget allows, it’s better to spend more on a quality brand.

Of course, we also have a problem in that we cannot develop a new JAR file because we do not have the testing and deployment leeway to support this extensive a change to our Pega environment in such a short time period. This shoots down creation of a bunch of classes because systems like Pega or Tibco BW permit external JARs to be added or some inline Java code to be inserted but there is no way to overtly create classes within the system! Sounds like a bunch of show-stoppers have cropped up.

Then we have the less-than-common ways of altering or damaging books. My copy of 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' has teeth marks in it because I thought it would be fun to read the Snape parts to my cat, Severus. He seemed to appreciate it, perhaps a little too much because in the midst of smooching the book, he decided he would also like to sink his teeth into it. He was less than kind with another book. My mum was taught a harsh lesson when she left her copy of 'The Devil's Feather' by Minette Walters on the floor. Severus urinated on it out of spite.

But what if we quench the Holy Spirit? Take a look at 1 Thessalonians 5:19. Here we have the same Greek construction. Our Bibles read, “Quench not the Spirit.” With this same tense it is, “Stop quenching the Spirit.” How often do you stifle the ministry of the Holy Spirit? Would that not account for why so many Christians walk after the flesh?

It means that love is greater than and therefore must be able to conquer whatever in the universe is unlovely, or it is not (as centuries of poetry, prose and song have said), I repeat, not the "greatest thing". And if it is not, we would do well to find something else that is greater and can conquer the seemingly limitless expressions of the unlovely.

The shop itself serves a variety of loose, flower, black and fruit teas with an excellent accompaniment of sandwiches, wraps, cakes, scones and just about any other sort of wonderful treats to go with tea.
Their menu made me giggle (immaturely) over such drinks as the “Pimp Martini” and the “Porn Star Martini” but I opted for the Dry Ten. This was pretty much a basic martini (Tanquery Ten & Nouilly Pratt) with a grapefruit twist. It was good, but I’ve discovered I’m not so partial to martini’s made with Tanquery Ten. My fellow tasters were generally happy with their various drink and the service was good. For my second round the server brought me something suggested by the bar based on my preferences. (It was gin, house bitters & cassis? I will take better notes next time when I blog so long after the fact!) It was good and I liked the simplicity of not trying to concoct something crazy or distracting me with umbrellas and sparklers.

3. The world feels a lot smaller. I can talk to anyone I want to, anywhere in the world. Need some Italian help in that book I’m working on?

In a way, it brings us all closer together, because on the internet, we’re all just little pieces of data we choose to share with each other.
They used little black plasters in the form of a crescent, called splenia. They applied them to give the effect of having been scattered on the skin. These patches were supposed to imitate the little spots commonly known as “beauty spots”. Sometimes , instead of plasters, little dots were made with a brush, to create the crescent form.
It's odd. My children are young adults now. Wouldn't you think that Christmas would be simpler? Instead, it's just the opposite.

Again, I don't care for Morrow's work on this one. Everything seems so murky and wooden. The story is not a great one either. Jonah falls for Carolee way too quickly and gets burnt by her just as fast (of course, she is only 17!) Not much develops with Emmy Lou and we get nothing of Mei Ling and we will never see Adrian Sterling again. I also disliked the Laurel & Hardy clown joke. Kinda cute, but outta place in a western book. For me the best part was the cover.

In other news, Harper Seven Beckham "puked up" all over Victoria at the Airport, why the hell does she not put the child in a bloody pushchair? I just don't get it and can only assume that there have been Kidnap threats that we don't know about, which make VB afraid to put the child down! Kids are all too precious and love to be held as much as we love to hold them, but I am sure Harper would be more comfortable at nap time if she were ensconced in a Bugaboo Frog on a nice little Sheepskin liner.....bliss, I've gone all sleepy just typing that and imagine the risk of Vicky B falling over on her 6 inch heels with a toddler in tow?

For all of The Road's bleakness and terror, it is at its core a story of Man and Boy. The father's anxiety. The boy's innocent. The father's protectiveness. The boy's curiosity. Even among a charred American wasteland, the central tensions of fatherhood remain. Warning: the final pages are liable to bring even the burliest paternal units to their knees.
From within the continent are governments which lack sufficient knowedge of modern world economy; governments filled with selfish, dark-souled, ideologically impotent implementers and planners. The governments lack people with deep sense of thorough planning and pragmatic commitment to industrialism; people capable of shaping and implementing feasible and qualitative strategies capable of inspiring collective enthusiasm in the people who may wish to contribute to the growth and development of the economy.

When I read the first one, I was on the fence on whether I wanted to pursue it. Then my daughter had me watch the first few episodes of anime and, rereading it, I became more and more intrigued by Kaname's character and the world-building regarding vampires/vampire hunters (genetic, by the way), and humans.

Of all the explorers from the early 20th century Shackleton is my favorite. He was heroic without being stupid. He brought all his men home alive from his mission to be the first to the south pole, which is a huge feat considering all the men who died trying to do the same thing. This film takes footage shot by the crew cinematographer and it shows us what life us like for the crew of the Endurance. It's some amazing footage. It's almost like being there alongside them as they make their quest.

We discussed this passage at length on our first day, and over the course of the next six weeks I grew to love it even more than I did the first time I read it. I cannot even express my joy about how perfectly Oscar Wilde’s artistic philosophy coincides with (and has influenced) my own.
After the parade, we went for a warm lunch at Peppers. Both girls gobbled up their mac n' cheese in a flash!

But getting the details right was not what motivated Gracie to share his account. A military man whose father, a Confederate general, died during the Civil War, Gracie admired bravery . . . and he wanted to let the world know about the impressive actions of the passengers and crew during the sinking. “It is my duty,” he wrote, “to bear testimony to the heroism on the part of all concerned.”
Garcia said that since the drug violence went through the roof over the last three to four years, he has seen a significant upsurge in salvations, healings, deliverances, miracles, church growth, unity between pastors and cooperation among churches, especially where unity and cooperation hadn’t existed before. The church he planted three years ago in Monterrey has grown from eight to 80.
I know that people have bad days, and I know my Wesleyan theology well enough to know that I must keep striving for perfection/sanctification. I know that’s why it’s called sanctifying grace, because it isn’t something that just happens—of course the grace to long for sanctification is a gift—but actually getting there is something that we must strive toward, giving ourself opportunities to learn along the way. Sometimes the learning of these lessons is hard, though, and I end up eating a lot of crow.

Next was the bed linen section, where we also lingered quite a while; I wondered how my life might be improved with a malleable pillow or a fluffy under sheet, would I not sleep better and therefore have a more productive day, if I had one? Would this not lead to a more creative and eventually successful life? What about new clean sheets and duvet covers that hadn't lost their buttons or gone a streaky blue in the wash? Would these not hugely benefit my life?

No.4, I’m not aware of any way of life only open to those who reject any notion of a divine power. One may find that the ‘life scientific’ is more often chosen by those who have no religious belief but one is not excluded from any scientific position on the basis of religion, even if there is a clear conflict between the tasks of the scientist and the belief in question. It is up to the believer to decide what he or she can/will and/or cannot/won’t do and whether or not the role is suitable for him or her, not the faculty or institution of employ. There have been cases in this country of registrars refusing to conduct same-sex civil partnerships and shop assistants refusing to sell alcohol, purely for religious reasons. Public opinion has very much been on the side of common sense in these cases. If you can’t or won’t do the job and all it entails for religious (or moral) reasons, don’t take it, it’s not up to your employer to be your moral compass, they’re there to assess if you are capable to fulfilling the role, not to check if you feel ok about it. Going back to original point however, I think it unlikely that a self-professed atheist (or indeed Muslim) would be able to find work as a vicar or imam, no matter what qualifications were held, or what previous experience acquired.
Call me a quidnunc full of quignogs if you will, but I can’t seem to get enough of stuff like this and I find myself assuming that there are others like me out there who also want to know these things.

Otherwise, Ms. Coolidge-Rask's literary output seems not to have left much impression on the shifting sands of time. These movie tie-ins weren't a terribly lucrative field for the writer-for-hire; usually there was just a flat fee -- probably, in the 1920s, no more than a thousand dollars or so, if that -- and that was that, no royalties. A shame, because London After Midnight may have sold pretty well; Mori's opinion notwithstanding, the movie was the most successful Browning-Chaney collaboration. Whatever MGM or Grosset & Dunlap paid her for her efforts, I hope for her sake she invested it wisely.
The center "straight" with the cards is a mini poster I bought at a yard sale for just this page. I started this page in August and could never quite get it how I wanted it.

One of Pari's friend was supposed to come over for dinner but she bailed out at the last minute. I was in charge of cooking while Pari was at work. I opted to make falafel. Sometimes it is difficult to cook in a new kitchen, with someones else cookware, and in a country where the items seem slightly different. As I tried to fry the falafel, the oil started to smoke and fulled the entire house! Hocine came running into the kitchen asking what was going on. We had to open all the windows and I was shut in the kitchen to fix the disaster. I quickly got it under control and finished the falafel. It did not hold together wonderfully but it tasted great. I even whipped up a little cucumber sauce to have on the top.
I always thought it was strange that the superintendent and the school system were often the focus at graduations rather than the schools and the principals. But it makes sense when you consider the “One system” focus and the haves-have nots culture that existed before (and that we’re still working on healing).

Agreeing that “NASA needs to bring back X-planes,” Shin says flight testing must be an integral part of aeronautics research. “In the past we looked at flight research as a culmination, a gala event at the back end of a program that proved the technology. But that no longer applies. We have to embed flight into our daily research activity.”

As a Betrayed Spouse, there is no doubt that the most devastating event that occurred in my life was to discover that the person I love most on this entire earth is cheating on me. Seven years ago, I lost my father and that pain was nothing compared to this one. The betrayal will not only change a person physically but most of all, emotionally. If you have been touched by this kind of betrayal, you will lose weight and sleep; and sometimes, your sanity. As I am trying to survive the past and dealing with this daily, it makes me rethink about who I am and everything I have believed in all my adult life. Sadly, I now think that everything I have believed about Love and Commitment are just a fantasy. I don’t know if this is just the emotions talking but now, I no longer believe in “Love ever after”, not anymore. “Love at first sight”? Yeah right. ”Soul mates?” Hah, another fantasy. What a joke right?

In 1904, a young woman with faith in God and a passion for education opened a school in Daytona Florida with $1.50 and five young African-American girls. Over the next fourteen years, the school would add a four-story building containing dormitories for students and teachers, a two-story addition containing kitchen and domestic science facilities, a twelve acre farm for growing vegetables, raising cows and practical training for the girls, another six acre tract and an auditorium. The woman with the drive and passion to do this was Mary McLeod Bethune and this was only the beginning of her amazing and productive life.
The regional Southern African Development Community (SADC) tribunal found in 2008 that Zimbabwe had wrongly taken land from nearly 80 farmers, saying they had been targeted due to their race.
New York City, not-too-distant-future: Eric Packer, a 28 year-old finance golden boy dreaming of living in a civilization ahead of this one, watches a dark shadow cast over the firmament of the Wall Street galaxy, of which he is the uncontested king. As he is chauffeured across midtown Manhattan to get a haircut at his father’s old barber, his anxious eyes are glued to the yuan’s exchange rate: it is mounting against all expectations, destroying Eric’s bet against it. Eric Packer is losing his empire with every tick of the clock. Meanwhile, an eruption of wild activity unfolds in the city’s streets. Petrified as the threats of the real world infringe upon his cloud of virtual convictions, his paranoia intensifies during the course of his 24-hour cross-town odyssey. Packer starts to piece together clues that lead him to a most terrifying secret: his imminent assassination.

Welcome to another nutty day at VCC. Today's featured nuts are cashews and pine nuts. Cashews are a slightly sweet nut that are fantastic as a snack on their own (I love mine roasted and lightly salted personally). They are also wonderful ground up into a paste and used to make creamy soups, sauces and other dishes. Try making a tasty cashew dip with fresh lemon juice and fresh herbs. Just soak a big handful (maybe about a cup) of the cashews for an hour or more. Drain them and add them to a food processor or blender with 2 or 3 roasted garlic cloves, a little fresh lemon juice, a touch of thyme, oregano and if you like it spicy, add a bit of chipotle or cayenne pepper. This makes a tasty dip for veggies, pita chips or crackers. Cashews are an excellent source of selenium, a nutrient known for its anti-oxidant properties. These babies are a good source of iron. Each 1 oz. serving has 5 grams of protien. All of this and they are just tasty tasty tasty!
Marti was, I think, the most wonderfully warm, modest, lovely “star” I have ever met. She was an absolute joy to be with. Talking to people who worked with Marti Caine is a bit like talking to people who own Apple Mac computers. They go on and on and on about how wonderful, marvellous, friendly etc etc etc… She once told me – and I totally believe it is true – that, although she’d liked the showbiz glitter to begin with, all she really wanted to do was be a housewife. She told me she really enjoyed hoovering and cleaning the house, but people would phone her up with offers of ludicrous amounts of money which she felt she’d be mad to turn down, so her career continued.

And here is Dragon with his Bronze medal for Cross Country, as well as his Merit Award for academic achievement. The merit awards are, apparently, a step below the academic achievement awards and as such are not presented on Speech Night. Dragon received his award during a special school assembly, held during the normal school day, so I didn't get to see it :(

b) Two to three days before taxes are due, however you have to wait until your accountant leaves for lunch or goes to the bathroom. This requires several hours of heavy surveillance on your part to ascertain precisely when she will not be in the office. Ideally the receptionist is also on the phone and therefore distracted. Sneak into the office, drop your paperwork on her desk and run. Run very fast.

What sets them apart is that it's been a year since the death of their newborn son and they have yet to talk about it. The corrugated box of ashes, tied up with string, has been relegated to a high shelf in the back of a closet. The fact of its being hidden there, though, does nothing to dispel the sense of lethargy, loss, anxiety, and despair that hovers over the Ryrie household.

Second, let’s remember the context of Providentissimus Deus 18-19 (and Divino Afflante Spiritu 3, which cites from that former encyclical.) Pope Leo is addressing instances in which there appears to be a conflict between the discoveries of physical science and certain passages of sacred Scripture. And the Holy Father says that in those instances we must remember that the Holy Spirit did not reveal to the authors of sacred Scripture “the essential nature of the things of the visible universe” and thus it’s fruitless to seek those details on Scripture because its authors, “did not seek to penetrate the secrets of nature, but rather described and dealt with things in more or less figurative language, or in terms which were commonly used at the time, and which in many instances are in daily use at this day, even by the most eminent men of science.” Only examples that fit this context are admissible as part of this discussion. Geocentrism is a classic example of this alleged conflict between the physical sciences and sacred Scripture. Therefore it fits the context perfectly.

At his father's house, William and his dad have dinner over two bottles of red wine, and the dad drinks to the memory of the victim even though William doesn't feel like talking about her. The dad tries to sympathize with William's failure to cry. They also talk about the dad's plans to move into his housing development in Concord, which is in a natural setting. The dad says William shouldn't feel too guilty about his accident, since worse things have happened in the war, adding, "That's why it seems to me so important to live close to nature. One wants to feel there is something permanent."

4) Can you spy…? Like I-spy, but one player describes something they can see and the other has to find it. Eg “I can see a yellow triangle” (hazard light in the car) or “I can see a chicken” (picture on an egg box). This is good for children too young for I-spy. Another variation as is I-spy colours (“I spy something green” etc).

As a writer of both fiction and non-fiction, I gladly take on the responsibility to make sure that my readers walk away from reading my books feeling encouraged, entertained, challenged – but never led astray. Since I am a Christian, my books will be marketed as such. I want readers to be able to recommend my books – for a parent of a teen to recommend one of my Inspirational Romances to a parent of another teen – with confidence. I want readers to come back for more. The way I do this is to take on the responsibility of writing with a moral and spiritual compass, knowing that my readers will hold me accountable.
Anyway, just wanted to let you know that I’ve been hijacked. Nothing I post until further notice can be verified to be written by me. At least not the me that I thought I was.

In the work of Steare (below), however, we see a reversion to the Kohlberg approach of "science" by opinion. And he seems to think that he has nothing to learn from research that others have done in the field. That double arrogance has led him into one large and very risible mistake. He appears blissfully unaware that the questions he asks are close to identical with the questions that psychologists use to detect lying (i.e. "lie scales" or "social desirability scales) so any correspondence of his conclusions to reality is purely coincidental. His arrogance has led him into naivety. He is a clown trying to make sense out of self-serving statements that are unlikely to be true.
I've had a lot of people ask me lately, "So what's wrong with your son?". Because he is such a complex little booger, I decided to type up some cliff notes - The Idiot's Guide to Owen, if you will. I'll have you know that I diagnosed at least three of these things prior to the doctors thanks to my extensive Googling. I'm confident that has earned me some type of honorary doctorate, however their club is pretty exclusive so this will have to serve as my official journal publication.

As parents we can find ourselves frustrated by the lack of speed our children have in getting tasks done. When we are tired of waiting or really need something done right now, we may find ourselves saying “Never mind, I’ll do it!” It often takes less time and energy to simply do it ourselves. However, when we jump in and do something our children should be doing, we are stealing the opportunity for them to increase their self discipline and sense of responsibility.
On paper, Atlanta still fields a strong team and a possible contender, but the return of key players from injury (Tim Hudson, Tommy Hanson) and the comeback of one of those aforementioned future stars (Jason Heyward, who was hyped to the moon as Willie Mays Mk. II in 2010, only to crash to earth last year) will dictate whether the Braves will pester the Marlins and Phillies or whether Fredi Gonzalez will have to wait out a painful recovery process until 2013. The potentially punchless nature of the lineup is also a concern, although the Atlanta bullpen (with shutdown studs Jonny Venters and Craig Kimbrel) remains one of the strongest in the game and might help ease the
The stakes are getting higher here, as these players are where the votes are actually counting, the emotional ties are deeper to certain players, and there’s more of a visceral reaction when hearing these players’ names, especially when in reference to their time with the Mets.
A loyal reader of this blog asked me whether Abbas's announcement had anything to do with Nancy Pelosi's Damascus trip or with the release of the British sailors. It is true that Pelosi has shown some interest in the fate of Shalit, as well as Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, the reservists captured by Hizbullah, who may well be dead already (see this video of her in Jerusalem). Apparently, she keeps pictures of the three captives in her office. I happen to like Pelosi, but I think that her visit was farcical at best. With regard to Shalit in particular, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is completely worthless. The fact is that none of the Palestinian leaders - not Abbas, not Dahlan, not Meshal, and definitely not Haniyah - are really in control of the people who are holding Shalit in Gaza right now.
I’m reminded of 1 Timothy 6:6-20, probably the most well known passage regarding money. Verse 17 says, “Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.” My husband and I have gone through many levels of finances; from selling possessions to pay rent, to times where purchasing a large TV was hardly noticed in the register. God has used those times to teach me what is important. I have a tendency to get concerned when the well is running dry, so, God allows the well to dry up. I am brought back to this passage again and again. “But godliness with contenment is great gain.” 1 Timothy 6:6
We left to have some lunch and walked around the block several times before deciding on a restaurant. We noticed that several shops had generators outside their doors, and while we were having lunch, we found out why—the power went out. It took just 15 minutes before the restaurant was stuffy and hot.

However much it sticks in our throat to see Murdoch win yet another battle, if Hunt can show that the BSkyB takeover meets the appropriate objective criteria, it is then legitimate for him to exercise his discretion as a minister according to the political convictions on which he was elected.

There’s good days and bad. Sometimes the good days surprise you. Today was one of those days. This afternoon I had it setup to go shoot with young LCpl from down the road. I threw together some target frames this week out of scrap lumber and had some cardboard cutouts stapled to them ready to head down to our little local shooting spot. World of wonders he shows up with another one of our neighbors. So our merry little band rolls out and on the way another of our neighbors is checking his mail. A quick invite and our numbers are now up to four.

Finally, it was inevitable, as it is with most anti-patent proclamations, that Lord Jacob erroneously applied concepts of obviousness (i.e., "very ordinary things") as a basis for determining patentable subject matter. It cannot be stressed strongly enough that "obviousness" is a legal concept that is completely independent of "patentable subject matter." An application that is found obvious won't issue as a patent because someone else has already disclosed the invention prior to the applicant. An application that is not deemed patentable subject matter won't issue as a patent because no one has the right to claim such an invention.
Next up was grilled Lockhart quail, grilled red romaine, candied orange, and cardamon yogurt by Chef David Bull from Congress Austin. The quail was out of this world. Chef David brined it in citrus for 24 hours, and that will be the next method I use when I cook poultry. It was sweet, juicy, and de-boned (except the leg bone which made for a nice handle). The sweet quail, tart orange, and subtly spiced yogurt was fantastic.

New Year's Day was a marathon shopping day. Holly picked me up and we grabbed some breakfast before heading to Stephanie's. I got to play with the twins a little more while she finished getting ready. Then we headed to Home Goods, Ikea, and lunch at Chili's. Steph went home, and Holly and I moved on to Anthropologie and Target. I got several cute things at Anthro, including the Hop, Skip, Jump skirt that I wore to work today. At Target I got some great basic sweaters on sale, a second pair of jeggings, and a new belt, all of which were paid for with gift cards. Then we went back to my house and I forced Holly to help me make some new outfits with my purchases so I knew I didn't waste my money. Holly left, I tidied up and went to bed.
Sharing his name with a noted TV actor creates enough confusion for this passionate NRI film maker but he is poles apart from the rest of the herd of newbies who venture into Bollywood film making. Aron Govil stands out as a visionary who knows the technicalities of what makes a film click on the box-office. Not just has he produced and directed his first independent film venture but the music release is also handled by his own music label Aron Govil Music.

The blender is a good tool for removing heavy ink buildups even if it won't erase completely on glossy, but it also discolors the area around it slightly and can cause even more little ridges like the ones you were trying to remove in the first place. Use it carefully as a removing tool but be careful since a little goes a long way. Also remember to clean the tip really well after using it with glossy paper.
If you have teak on your boat, regular care will be required to maintain the original rich color and protect the wood. For various reasons, it’s best to varnish your teak. Instead, wash it off with the mild detergent used for the hull, rinse, dry, and apply teak oil. If the teak is worn and has lost some of its color, rub it gently with sandpaper (a heavier grade at first, followed by a finer grade). Once the sanding is completed, clean off the wood, allow it to dray and apply teak oil. Performing this kind of maintenance will go a long way in keeping your boat’s wood looking like it should.
Morris, in his 12th year, needs that big leap -- he has only three years left on the ballot. And this is where the irony comes in: I really think Morris' totals will leap this year -- maybe even into the high 60s. Why? Several reasons, but the biggest is this: Blyleven is in the Hall of Fame now. Morris fans may still insist that he was a better pitcher than Blyleven, but as I kept telling various friends who are big Morris supporters, that's a losing argument. They needed Blyleven off the ballot so that they could argue for Morris on his own merits rather than making vaguely illogical arguments about how Morris -- despite the numbers -- was better than Blyleven.
