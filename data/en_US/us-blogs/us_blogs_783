Kamisama Hajimemashita which is about a girl whose dad gets a lot of debts and she gets kicked out her house. then she “defends” a man that she meets from a dog and he tells her that she should go to his house if she’s got nowhere to go. it turns out that he was th previous god of the shrine and now he’s made her the new god and from now on she has to live in a shrine with a grumpy (and sexy) familiar and two other spirits and it follows her crazy story of godhood.

Navrathri is nearing and everyone in India is busy in buying dolls. Preparing different Neivedyams for evening pooja for distribution is a real fun. There are different dishes prepared during these 9 days. Each one follows their own custom of doing it.
Last, Happy Daylight Savings! Yes, I was a total goober and did not reset my alarm clock and woke up an hour late this morning. I hate the way it feels to get up an hour earlier than normal. Now I get to save that special feeling it for tomorrow. On a positive note though, I will now get home early enough to take my pictures out of doors, in the daylight! That means that my readers will have to wait until the day AFTER to see the photos of “what I wore today,” but they will be of a higher quality. Of course, I didn’t think of this until after I’d taken today’s photos, so the new schedule doesn’t take effect until tomorrow. Check back on Wednesday for Tuesday’s outfit.
of happiness
May the God who gives us peace make me holy in every way and keep my whole being. Spirit, soul, and body – free from every fault at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls me will do it, because He is faithful in Jesus Christ Name! Amen!
As for this week, I’m afraid not much has changed on my desk apart from the absence of the mask picture which has now winged it’s way to Spyder who is giving it a good home!
"Who would want to steal modern art," Tom said abstractedly.
“The main problem lies with the present, not the distant past.”
In 2005, Pressly appeared in "Death to the Supermodels," a film that featured half a dozen immodest women in virtually no clothes at all. It's not surprising that the Kashmir region of Pakistan was struck by a massive earthquake. The following year, Pressly was featured with even more scantily clad women in "DOA: Dead on Arrival," supposedly a video game adaptation/martial arts movie, but it was really just an excuse to show nubile young women in bikinis so they would bring destruction to the world! The result was an earthquake off the Hawaii islands, one that was intensified by the concentration of immodest women always found there anyway.
A lot of my blog will probably be about everyday things. Our family, our ministry, cooking and cleaning, amateur photography, and mommy stuff!!
Then she lied down on the floor. She did not have the strength to crawl into bed.
If anything, a plausible argument can be mounted that the scheme of the Act itself does integrally involve the concept of use. Section 17 defines a trade mark as “a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person”. Section 20(1) confers on the holder of a registered trade mark the exclusive rights “to use the trade mark” and “to authorise other persons to use the trade mark”. Section 7(4) defines “use of a trade mark in relation to goods“ as “use of the trade mark upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods (including second-hand goods)” while Part 9 of the Act contains a detailed regime for removal of a trade mark from the Register for extended non-use for any reason.
One person in particular who has been such an inspiration to me is a man named Byran Smith. When I was living in Nashville, I signed up to teach adults to read. Byran was 42. He was from Jamaica. He had a wife and four kids, and he was at a second grade reading level. By the time we were done, he could write checks, read his children bedtime stories and help work colleagues spell words. Working so diligently to try and explain our hard (nonsensical) language was one of the toughest and most rewarding experiences of my life. It’s a constant reminder that without words, we have so little, and with words, our lives can become richer and more beautiful than we could have ever dreamed. I think of him and his perseverance whenever I get tired or don’t feel like doing much. His ambition is an ongoing lesson to never lose mine.

Definitely! There's a more laid-back feel to SoCal so I started dressing more casually when I moved here. I also started wearing more color. People don't wear as much black here as they do on the East Coast.

Our recent withdrawal from Iraq and our continuing difficulties in Afghanistan show that our confused foreign policy is making us largely ineffective at achieving our aims, and this impotence is on display for all the world to see which only compounds our weakness.

The one clear picture that emerges is that an anniversary beer can be anything a brewer wants it to be. Don't expect a certain style, taste, color or aroma. Most often these are in larger format bottles -- at least 22 ounces or more. The one nearly universal commonality appears to be that these brews tend to fall well outside of the session beer category. You can expect the alcohol content to be dialed up a bit when it comes time for a brewery to celebrate a milestone.

Whether or not Becky's labor, and IBS's mission, is alienated in the Marxist sense is beside the point insofar as we're trying to figure out what the film does or says. (I certainly don't claim it's anti-capitalist, or anti-hegemonic.) But I think it is meaningful that the film designates as its goal a workplace where the feeling of community is important.
But those are really where the similarities end. While both movies are very, very violent, Super is more visceral in its violence. There are no sweeping ballets of Big Daddy or Hit Girl taking out numerous thugs. It’s mostly just Rainn Wilson beating people with a wrench until the very end where guns finally come into play.
I dropped her off, and they colored easter eggs, had a tea party outside, and rode tricycles. Addie was not ready to leave (I left her for an hour and 20 minutes), but Hunny assured her that she could come over again.
I have a journal of ideas of selfies that I want to take. Notes about what I want to express, where to go to photograph it and what to wear. It's fun. It's a little like playing for me. Playing dress-up or pretend. Letting the kid out again.

Lord Black is a stubborn, stubborn man, and so he did not do that — he decided just to live here as a permanent resident non-citizen. Which was still all well and good until the time came that he got into legal troubles. Which has left him technically inadmissible here, except through application for a “minister’s permit”, which he has now done.
I’m wriggling out of my oppressive comfort layer, and ripping off those grubby old band aids. I’ve been turning to food rather than to God and my loved ones when I need help. My addictions seem comfortable and safe, but they are certainly not ‘innocent’. They dull my senses, steal my health and rob me of the very best that life has to offer.
It doesn't say, "Imagine we fixed our country." It dares the listener to imagine there is no country to begin with. It compels us to "imagine" a world that is radically different in ways that most of us -- myself included -- take for granted.
The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that both omega 3 and omega 6 fats use the same enzymes for conversion into the forms in which they are active in the body. The same elongase and desaturase enzymes that convert omega-3 fats into their beneficial anti-inflammatory forms (the series 3 prostaglandins and the less inflammatory thromboxanesand leukotriennes) also convert omega-6 fats into their pro-inflammatory forms (the series 2 prostaglandins and the pro-inflammatory thromboxanes and leukotrienes). So, when a food is eaten that contains high amounts of omega 6s in proportion to its content of omega 3s, the omega-6 fats use up the available conversion enzymes to produce pro-inflammatory compounds while preventing the manufacture of anti-inflammatory substances from omega-3s, even when these beneficial fats are present.
To make sure no one misses out on the early stages of this Red-tailed Hawk story, we’ve put together a temporary page on our All About Birds website where we invite you to watch these magnificent birds. The site will be live 24 hours a day and the video can be streamed in HD. You can also watch on mobile devices such as smartphones and iPads. A full-featured BirdCams site will launch in late April with many more species, including Osprey, Black Vulture, and Great Horned Owl.
I was scrolling through some old images of pieces I painted long ago and actually felt a desire to take it up again. For me, the pendulum swings between attempting a refined, traditional handpainted style or trying for a more primitive, stylized look. And sometimes I like to go for something altogether more contemporary (read: trendy), when taking on a handpainting project.
As a younger man I was a complete bonehead wrt women. I remember (amongst a few such incidents) a particular Saturday morning. The lovely dark-haired young lady and I had been on a couple of dates, and we planned to spend the morning out and about. We drove around to her mother's house, a substantial pile in a sweet part of town. Mother wasn't home. As we wandered the rooms, I failed to notice that her gorgeousness was wearing a very flirty dress, spent a lot of time close to me, and lingered long in her childhood bedroom showing me bits and pieces from earlier days. Only later did I realize just how bright and clear her green lights shone in my direction.

In a blender or food processor, add lentils, tahini, lemon, garlic, and salt. Blend for several minutes, scraping down sides as necessary. If the texture is too thick, add a tablespoon or so of olive oil and try again.
In fact, many of those clerical-fascist fighters in Iraq, came from Libya. In fact, just one town in the East of Libya provided more jihadists in Iraq than anywhere else. These are the same jihadists who have been fighting to overthrow Gaddafi, and who make up the most organised, effective fighters amongst the Eastern rebels. But now, apart from this current article, instead of arguing that such forces cannot provide real liberation for the Libyan people, the AWL have kept quiet about any potential problems that might arise if these forces are successful. As on so many other occasions the difference in approach seems to come down to this. In Iraq, those jihadists were fighting AGAINST “Democratic Imperialism” and its allies. In Libya, they are fighting on the same side as that “Democratic Imperialism”.

Did any of those hit close to home? Think about the people who you converse with on a regular basis, do they fall in to one of those categories? Which one are you? The majority of the time we will fall in to a single category but often we find ourselves dabbling in each of them throughout our conversations. If reading any of those descriptions made you feel uncomfortable about your listening skills do not be alarmed. When I first heard those I was shocked as I discovered that at one point or another I had been all four and to this day I still make a conscious effort while listening to stay away from any of those negative habits.

The simplicity of the approach brings a low barrier to entry, but as the OSR shows, it also means the potential is vast, and grows with experience rather than shrinks.

Demure – What a mixed bag. The gamine thing seems to work consistently for Natalie Portman, probably because she is so very beautiful. Known sex bomb Penelope Cruz looked a bit like a prom queen, albeit one with an amazing rack. But there were two standout fashion failures in this category. It pains me to say that Emma Stone’s bow was not only derivative (see Kidman, Nicole) but is the type of feature that confounds and potentially terrifies most men. Also, kudos to Michelle Williams for wearing attention-grabbing coral that showcases that alabaster skin, especially on her open back, but was that a… gasp – peplum? I once purchased a peplum skirt after a fashion editor convinced me it was ‘timeless, elegant and fashion forward.’ When I tried it on for my… gasp – mother, she simply said, ‘Honey, that’s a boner shrinker.’ The tags hang on that skirt to this day.
This law explains the mysterious gamma ray bursts. As a galactic black hole intensifies, it starts bending space in the direction of the more massive gravity object. When the black hole collides with the gravity object, it causes a gamma ray burst and great destruction, much the same way a tornado touchdown causes destruction.

I think we make those life choices by, our parents giving us the tools to build the trust and faith as we grow up. To take those tools with us as we chose the friends we keep, those who become husbands and wives. We find how strong those tool are when the times get tough. How strong is the foundation we have built to with-stand the floods and storms that life puts in our path?
Continuing physical surveillance of Mister A and his possible accomplices, Messrs. B, C, and D, reveal that Mister D is less careful than the others in keeping a low profile. He is observed to be spending a great deal of money, despite having no job and no known income from other sources, and the police obtain permission to place him under electronic surveillance, tapping his home phone and his mobile phone. Mister D continues to dig his own grave by discussing the possibility of unloading some quality merchandise with a man already known to the police as a fence for jewellery and other upmarket items.

It still looked fun with the little eggs piled on top - they are gluten free, apparently, although not all Cadbury’s chocolate is. And it tasted lovely with the gingery flavour between the layers.

Heinz Fiery Chilli Ketchup is part of their new chilli range which also includes Heinz Chilli Ketchup (a milder version).

It’s not extremely spicy but you will pick up on a bit of heat from the rice. All recipes will be given a spice rating and you can find out what these ratings mean on the About page.

The entire premise of the confrontation is in itself was flawed, for starters, much emphasis was given on PNoy’s responses to several issues deemed by the media as ‘sensationally’ inadequate.

One day I yelled at someone so fiercely that the person cried. I won’t lie; I felt justified in my anger, but I did not feel justified in my deliverance. So with time to calm down and to put myself in that person’s shoes, I apologized. It was a sign of humility to show that I did not think that everything I did was right because of the position I held in our relationship. That humility helped me to see that I must always see myself as the person that I am dealing with.

We can say that ‘real’ growth in life happens when we are eager to risk and widen our abilities; when we are willing to put it on the line for change. It is easy to live with the same crowd, making the same thing we have constantly done. In short, we like things that have a system of activities that will only lead us to the same result we have always gotten.
These shoes make me approximately 8 feet tall. OK, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but I do tower over Mark while wearing them, and that makes me feel like I'm 8 feet tall. I sort of accidentally bought these shoes one day when I went running some errands and stopped into Nordstrom Rack. I say it was accidental because I went in there looking for a duvet cover, but I figured it couldn't hurt to take a look at the shoes, and the next thing you know I find these in my size and I'm trying them on and they look great and they're surprisingly comfortable and they're less than half the original price and... You know how it goes.

Two days ago there was all kinds of coverage about our greatest national tragedy. We got to see replays of the news coverage. We got to see replays of the speeches made from people great and small about what happened. Politicians ran out with hard hats and shovels trying to look busy. Ordinary people rose up to help our fellow man. The truest heroes in our life time ran into a towering inferno, knowing they wouldn’t return, because it was their duty. Christ said to us “No greater love hath a man, they he should lay down his life for his brother”. That being true, heaven got a good bit fuller that day.

First some commercial: If you’re on Facebook and you’re interested in interfaith discussions between Jews and Muslims, which are conducted with a good and respectful attitude, then I encourage you to visit the group “Jihadi Jew.” I can’t emphasize enough how important it is with a respectful dialogue between Jews and Muslims, and how rare it is to find a place offering it. Jihadi Jew does just that. It is created by a Jew, Lee Weissman, and moderated by two Muslims, Heshke (who occasionally comments here, even though I’m not so good at responding lately, sorry Heshke), and Marc.

And about this girl. We weren’t in any kinda relationship or stuff. That was because neither of us wanted it. So we both had agreed upon certain things, some mutual considerations and so called discussions. But the point is that I really felt I was compatible with her, like no one else.

I ride a Merida Matts mountain bike from the 1990s with a rigid steel fork on the road… In fact, I ride it on road, off road and everything in between. Also, I ride a cyclocross bike with a rigid carbon fork (which is essentially a road bike with clearance for mud) off road so, it’s really not an exact science; very basically, the various types of bike will give you very different riding positions so it’s more about finding one that works for you.

As the two finally reached their home, they stood silently for a moment more in regard of the night sky. The stars, in full affect now, seemed to pulse with energy and knowledge.

While the muslin (made of actual muslin) seemed to be the right size for an over-blouse, the finished garment in a heavier, coarser weave seems a bit too large.

Be sure and check or put on the line in coupon when making the payment that the extra amount is applied to principal; this amount cannot be gotten back once paid. The sooner you start the sooner you will pay off the mortgage as principal is reduced over time as your monthly payment is a graduated schedule with early payments applied to interest payment first. I did a quick check at www.bankrate.com and based on a $250000 loan, 30 years at 4.5% the survey says:

And I rewind to eleven years ago when I moved to Kansas. When I enrolled in my senior year of high school. When I was met with questions of “have you ever been shot at?” “Do you own a beeper?” ” You smoke weed, right?” “Are you legal?” “Do you have a green card?” “What exactly is Puerto Rican? Is that some kind of black?”

As you all know my husband started a new job on the 14th. It has been incredibly difficult, for him and for me. He was so torn when it was time to leave. I know he wanted to stay, and I know he needed to go. But God has covered us, and surrounded us with people who treat their neighbor as they treat themselves. In particular two people have helped a tremendous amount. Tomas' nurse came and stayed with him the first night Mike had to leave. She came off the clock and left her two small boys overnight to stay so Tomas would not be alone. It turned out to be his roughest night and she had to make a lot of decisions in caring for him, and she did wonderful. The next day my neighbor volunteered to pick the girls up from their day camp, keep them overnight, and bring them to camp this morning. This allowed me to stay all day yesterday and last night. I have friends and family who would be here in a heartbeat if they didn't live over 1000 miles away. Then I have all of you, this community of women. You beautiful, beautiful women. You who pray for my son, who send messages of compassion, hope and good cheer.

In my tenth chapter of my book I talk about the stress I was under when I found out I was pregnant for my second child. My first child was only 9 months and I was totally unprepared for this happening again. I was so sick just like when I carried my first but I knew I could not leave to go live with my parents again. I had to struggle this one on my own.
“Well ya see, Norm, it’s like this. A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That’s why you always feel smarter after a few beers.”

Going deeper into the wood, the grounds seem to glow with a blue hue: seas of wild hyacinths with here and there the discord froth of a white, or pinkish one. Slope after slope is covered by an army of pointing stems with leaves still furled. The first warm May-day and these soldiers will unfurl their leaves, bursting into a song of lilies of the valley.
Somehow, it's also made me feel more involved in school, though I don't even enter the building. I am glad to have the visual of Tucker dart off to his class, and I have even seen Calvin's teacher from his Mom's Day Out, as she drops her daughter off. I love that! It's nice to feel a little more community-minded, especially since I live in the least community-minded community in the whole Birmingham area. At least, that's how it seems to me.
Ross, thank you.

Obadiah took a moment to look around. At the back of the cafe was a small yard, half of it covered by concrete and the other half with compressed dirt and saw dust. The pile of logs was to his left, just by the dirt track that went around the lone building and to his right was a ramshackle log shed where the unused fire wood from last winter lay strewn about. Beyond the yard was the raw of the tall maple trees he saw from out front and beyond the maple trees a forest with a small clearing where he spied several deer grazing in the tall meadow grass. The late afternoon air smelled fresh, woodsy and, Obediah thought, of marzipan. Obadiah rolled up his sleeves and got stuck into chopping wood.

New York Mayor Bloomberg announced, April 19, 2012 (NY Post) that he has launched the WHO / UNICEF Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, a program to support and encourage women to breastfeed. Mayor Bloomberg states, "There is a 22% reduced risk for childhood obesity when women breastfeed for 6 months".
This beer bar, for that is all it serves, a copper colored brew and a dark but not opaque brew. They are known as Light and Dark respectively. The brew is served in glass mugs that I will guess have the capacity of half a bottle of beer poured with gusto. Those in the know will respond, when asked what they want by the bartender, "Two and two..." That will get you two mugs of Light and two mugs of "Dark" the equivalent of about sixteen ounces of beverage. This ritual has been in place there for as long as I can remember… For over thirty years the mugs of brew have always been tendered in such a way. Ah yes... the mugs.
The website Daily Kos has also deleted a diary about Rep. Gabrielle Giffords entitled “My Congresswoman Voted Against Pelosi, Now She’s Dead To Me,” but so far has not deleted a post by founder Markos Moulitsas that lists Giffords’ district among those on their “target list,” and noted that “Not all of these people will get or even deserve primaries, but this vote certainly puts a bulls eye on their district.” (emphasis ours).
The purpose of the second photo is to get a shot of the little writing desk and large oil painting. The photo is taken low (right at table height) and at a 90 degree angle to the subject -- it's that studied gaze which I've written about before. A chair is placed slightly askew. The placement of the rug has changed. It's almost as if the zebra tail is pointing to the desk as if to say, "Look at this!"

I am doing fine, so please don't worry about me. The reason I published the SAHM post is simply because sahms are often misunderstood by many. With my personal experience sharing, I hope to give working people an insight of the life of a sahm. We might seem like we have lots of time, with no reports to run, no meetings to attend, and no deadlines to meet. But we have our own commitments too. I'm not upset over my friend's remark, just irritated. I just want to remind her that life as a sahm is not what she thinks. She is fortunate to have her parents taking care of her kids, and at anytime she needs to go on a date with her hubby, her parents are always there for her. To me, I don't care a damn about how she lives her life and how blessed she is. I just live mine the way I choose it, with or without support from relatives. I've come so far all by myself, and I don't get demoralise with her remarks. So, yes, I'm feeling good and definitely not going to get miserable over this :-)
Four of us of us had been invited on-board for a three night stay, the beginning leg of a longer cruiser that took in several Pacific Islands. It would be as good a chance as any to experience the joys of cruise life.
Here are a few of my tried and true tips and ideas to try the next time you find yourself in a queue, a waiting room, on a plane, or any other situation where you may need to keep your little ones quiet and at bay. They've worked for me; I hope they work for you. The basic premise is to keep your child busy. By giving them something specific to do you'll be combating boredom, and may have fun in the process. So, give your toddler a job...Part 1 offers Gross Motor Exercises. In my follow up article I offer some Fine Motor Exercises. And the series will finish with the all-important Cognitive Exercises, to keep your little one thinking all the time.
At that point, her idyllic life was snatched away when a social worker took her away from her picturesque Oxfordshire home. Dawn was informed that despite the fact her parents Gina and Pete had fostered her from birth, they were unsuitable for raising her.
McCombes does not take refuge in the excuse of witnesses Katrine Trolle and Anvar Khan, in that that they got their dates mixed up. Instead he argues: “In the period spanning November 2001 to September 2002 Tommy visited Cupids not once but twice or more. There is no doubt in my mind that he was in Cupids on the weekend beginning Friday 23 November 2001.”

The caterer was ecstatic when he heard the recipes. The cook took some getting used to being told by a woman who wore jeans and had no idea about cooking for 10 people (forget 400!). But soon enough the simple charm of the recipes caught on. Later, that evening over some tea, they told me that the recipes where simple, almost modest and yet so different from the ones he served up that they decided to go with my ideas.

Who's to say these incidents are real or not? For every unsettling feeling there is another that indicates that we are using the deaths of real people as our own entertainment. Is it harmless or dehumanizing? Nowadays it seems that these "incidents" are fewer and fewer as the demand for "real" (read: found footage) horror escalates. The PR teams that grew up on these "curses" are now the people selling these films to us.
In the midst of this very busy season, I've had such unbelievable love and support from my children, and from Gary, of course. Will comes over and hangs out with us, giving me another adult in the house. Andy asks me when I'm going to make time to take a bath and relax. Dan provides quiet moments and the sweetest hugs. Sometime in this past year, I've met myself. And I see I need more -- from me. I need to BE in each moment - unhurried. I need order and peace and joy. Most of all I need to stop once in a while.

Did you know that David Bowie’s wife Angela bought the rights for Black Widow and Daredevil in 1975, in the hopes of turning them into television’s sexiest crime-fighting duo? She did. The series didn’t fly in our universe, which makes sense after seeing those pictures. But the parallel universe Marvel? They loved it. They loved it enough to bring the character back fifteen years later. The other woman joining the fray is the muscle-bound beauty She-Hulk, played by Brigitte Nielsen. This six foot tall action star held her own against Arnold Schwarzenegger in “Red Sonja” and Sylvester Stallone in the bedroom, and in 1989 she did a few screen tests for She-Hulk. Judging by where her career ended up in our universe (quasi-seriously dating Flavor Flav on too many reality shows), parallel universe Nielsen is pretty psyched to have built a green dynasty for herself. It worked for Ferrigno.

If I am caught in suffering, in pain, I create the idea of peace, the idea of tranquillity. I create the idea of truth according to my like and dislike, and therefore that idea cannot be true. Yet that is what we are constantly doing. When we contemplate as we generally do, we are merely trying to escape from confusion. “But”, you say, “when I am caught in confusion I cannot understand; I must escape from it in order to understand.” That is, you are trying to learn from suffering.

This was three coats, but I admit I was in a bit of a hurry so if I had been more careful I might have been able to get away with two.

BROOKLYN, N.Y.—The Tribeca Film Festival ended Sunday night, so as far as I know, you won't be able to see any of the films I saw and/or reviewed since my last Tribeca round-up. Still, that doesn't mean you can't read my pieces and keep the ones I reviewed positively in mind for the future...right?
Our good friend, and one of the best priests I’ve had the pleasure of knowing, came to visit us, and pray with us, and offer us his condolences and support. This is just what he does. He comes when he is needed. And when I grabbed his hand, still sleepy and a little groggy from what had happened during the night and from being in the hospital all day, and I’m sure a little incoherent, and told him that I had a new job for us, and explained that he needed to help us change the laws so that people could do something as basic as bury their own child, he nodded, and said he would do what he could. He then left, quickly, and completely out of character for him. We found out later that he had gone straight to the “right people” (whoever they are) and found out that we could in fact bury our baby, and he had, in fact, started the process for us. God is good because He allows us to have a priest such as this one to help us in our need.

I feel inadequate, but all I can say in my own defense is that even the best juggler (which I certainly am not) can get caught up in trying to juggle more balls than he/she can handle without the addition of some extra appendages. (Yes, I realize I'm mixing my metaphors again; it's like a big ol' metaphor soup up in here.)
Quite a clean and fresh flavour; although I’m sure many will find this refreshing and easy to drink, I, personally, would prefer a cocktail with a little more character.

The rest of my time was spent simply following the sketch and putting my card together. One thing I did differently than I usually do it that using my eyelet border punch I decided to punch both the top and bottom part of my card stock. I like how that turned out and I'll have to remember to do that more often.
DO NOT BE A CREDIT HUNTER! To many inquiries can harm your credit. Shopping at all the department stores and applying for their cards to save 10%, can come back to haunt you. Try and keep your credit inquiries down to 1 per quarter, if you need to do them. When applying for a mortgage with a mortgage broker, we pull your credit report once, and can shop it to over 40 different lenders with that one inquiry.

Something we’re seeing early on in ‘Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects’ is Aggra’s notion of Thrall being a slave to the Horde and his duties there. I have to wonder what this woman is thinking. A slave to the Horde? Thrall stepped up and made the Horde what it was. Do you know why? Because he had to. No one else was willing or capable at the time. And you know what? He loves the Horde.

Here we learn that the Scriptures foretold the infamy and destiny of Judas the traitor. In the light of 1 Timothy 2:4 and many other such Scrip­tures, we know that God certainly did not influence Judas to betray the Lord Jesus and refuse His gift of eternal life.

I can handle pressure when it’s fair and I understand what’s being asked of me. However when I don’t understand what you want, adding more pressure doesn’t cause me to understand things faster, it causes my brain seize up and stop working.
Yeah, I may have mentioned before that my mom has an addiction to prescription painkillers that she won't admit to. She thinks my brother and I are crazy, and she thinks she doesn't have a problem. Anyway. She got all spaced out at my dad's parent's house and ended up eating pecan pie (or jabbing a fork into the full pie tin and missing her mouth on the way to take a bite) in a sleepy daze. I could have slapped the bitch, and would have if my grandmother hadn't have been sitting right there. Or if my brother didn't yank me outside.
The Funkees presented the most authentic blend of the raw western funk and a touch of psychedelic flare, something that gives the music a timeless feel that anyone from this generation can really enjoy. By the time you get to the compilations closer, ‘Dance With Me’, you are fully submerged into the late 70′s deep funk that would pave the way for artists like Prince. The heavy James Brown influence comes when you hear certain vocal chants sung in English that push against the massive funk rhythms drive. There is a sizzling dance floor groove that embodies every song and it’s unreal the way it moves me on every listen. Soundway Records gives this band the ultimate treatment with the gatefold high grade vinyl and CD compilation Dancing Time: The Best of Eastern Nigeria’s Afro Rock Exponents 1973-77, giving a new historical reference that has been needed for decades. With a mixture of lyrical styles that even the balance out from their native language and English, each song flows with a sense of integrity. The western influence isn’t felt on every piece with some tracks going very deep into the ancestral sound of their heritage and stripping any type of western influence.

I am cleaning the screen-in room today, I don't know how it gets so dusty over the winter but it is an all day job. I am taking advantage of this sunny morning to have breakfast on the big porch and browse through my decorating magazines that have been piling up.

The actual game itself was pretty infuriating though, because the referees were making INSANE calls. They’d throw my boys in the penalty box (especially Franzen) for the slightest offense, but then pretend not to see blatant tripping and holding from Nashville. I know what you’re saying: Oh, she just wanted her team to win. But the calls got so obnoxiously biased that by the beginning of the third period, the entire arena booed the refs when they came on the ice. Ouch.

Once upon a time I would have said that I don't like fantasy stories. Once upon a time I would never have ventured into the children's section to browse the books. Books for me to read. For myself. But authors like JK Rowling and Suzanne Collins and Lois Lowry and even Carl Hiaasen have made this my go-to genre. And have you noticed that most of the books being published in this genre are fantasy? Veddy interesting.
The report says officers were racially stereotyping African-Caribbean people as criminals, and thus disproportionately subjecting them to stop and search. It says officers were exercising the power without having the legal requirement of having reasonable suspicion that the person stopped was involved in crime: “Many police officers make the illegitimate step in their minds from ‘black people are disproportionately involved in crime’ to ‘the black person I am about to stop and search is likely to be a criminal’ without consideration of the other factors necessary to establish sufficient ‘reasonable grounds’.
To keep the airflow passing over the top and centre of the diffuser, teams direct the fast moving flow from the sidepods undercut to this area. In Red Bulls case, the path of this flow is obstructed by the exhaust ramp and plume. To overcome this Red Bull have simply created a tunnel for the air to pass under the exhaust ramp and remerge towards the centre of the diffuser. This solution looks like is major aim was to direct flow to the start motor hole, an area exploited by ductwork on the 2011 RB7. Having more airflow passing into the starter motor hole, makes the hole act like a blown slot, making the airflow better up and under the middle section of diffuser for more downforce. Creating a crossover effect is somewhat like McLarens bulged exhaust fairing, that allow both the exhaust to be directed down to the diffuser edge by the downwash flow over the sidepod, but also creates a channel beneath the exhaust bulge to allow the undercut flow to reach the centre of the diffuser.
I’m tired of feeling overwhelmed.

The Outskirts Press site like many comparable POD publishers is informative and user friendly. Authors can sign in and monitor their book sales and progress via their own account.

Despite being planted in the best soil, with organic fertilizer, careful watering, and daily pampering, I had to remove about half the leaves from this pathetic thing today because they were covered with nasty black spots that my research tells me is "early blight."
The “U.S.” missed warning signs? The Bush administration ultimately voted against giving Solyndra a taxpayer-backed loan. To me it sounded like a sham from the start (as does just about anything into which this administration sinks its teeth and our money). The rest of America wasn’t consulted on whether the loan was a good idea or not — so it’s not really fair to say the entire country missed the warning signs. I guess this particular headline writer’s credo is “if you can’t blame Bush, blame the whole country.”

I'll end on a good note, though. Last night, the Pumpkin came in our room in the 2:00 hour, going right to sleep in between Londo and me, not even waking me. The Pookie toddled in our room right about 4:00. He climbed into bed easily enough, and he tried to get comfortable. But he could not get comfortable or settle down.
Much of the current interest in manufacturing worldwide has been driven by the 2008/09 global financial crisis. This was triggered by a huge overdose of bank lending and an overextended financial industry in a number of countries, led by the US and the UK but also extending to much of the rest Europe.
I've learned that with growing mentally and spiritually, you have to experience some pain in order to mature. It's different from the physical pain of growing pains, but it can cut you to the core and make you feel as though your heart is breaking. I've been at both ends of the spectrum. I've felt times of such intense pain that I thought I couldn't take it anymore. (These were probably the usual situations family, friends, life decisions, etc.) I've also been so numb that I just didn't care anymore. (Despite, getting a break from feeling, I can promise you feeling is so much better.) Through these times, I grew as a person. It seems that whatever situation life throws at you, you can persevere. If you take the bad situation and try to learn from it. You will always make mistakes because we are all imperfect, but the important thing is to learn and allow change to take place in your life.
Those are odd together, but not really. I think it would be cute to have water, mints, Advil, energy shot, and program all in one little pouch. Of course these will be marked with little nerd things, like 1 extra life on the energy shot or +1 on the mints.

Binondo, Manila; a young woman is found murdered in a room above the bar where she works as a cabaret singer. Cyrus Ledesma of the Philippines Police force is sent to investigate. Binondo, is Manila’s Chinatown, and as a mestiso (half Chinese, half Filipino) is also Ledesma’s home turf.

To call Alexander Zemlinsky a forgotten composer would be an exaggeration: a quick search on the site of a leading online retailer shows nearly a hundred available recordings of his music. Yet how many of us can name more than a handful of his works beyond the Lyric Symphony? Marc Moskovitz’s new biography will help train a spotlight on this composer/conductor/pianist, lover of Alma Schindler and brother-in-law of Schoenberg. Here is an edited extract from the book’s preface:
The 70 year old Alje van Deemter and his wife Annemarie (70) were attacked in their house in the crime-ridden Bloemspruit area, on Saturday morning. Mr van Deemter's arm was seriously injured as he tried to prevent being hit on the head with a hammer. Mrs van Deemter had a knife held against her throat. The attacker(s) wore face masks.
On the way to work there is more fruit. A taxidermist (a profession I would have thought long gone - maybe it survives by stuffing beloved pets!) has a large snake wound round the tree in front of the business. In its mouth is an apple.

We went to this very fancy-shmancy restaurant in…….. (I can’t tell you, what if you try to kill me? Or worse, stalk me? ) somewhere snooty. Since I’m all grown up now we don’t go to McDonalds anymore, no we go to rooftop restaurants that require us to put on uncomfortable dresses that can easily be blown away by the wind, and even more uncomfortable heels because of course these places are too good for converse. We also like going there because we can compete with ladies at other tables to see who can get their pinkies up highest while sipping our drinks. Sometimes, we pretend we’ve got British accents. We’re really really bad at it though

There are two different fallacies regarding Sarah Palin. One group thinks of her in negative terms, that she's a hick, or an opportunist, or that she's inexperienced and unqualified for high public office. One recent example of this is Aaron Sorkin, who recently penned a rant for the Huffington Post in which he criticized Sarah's apparent delight in killing animals, even though he admitted he himself was a meat eater. Apparently he thinks people that produce meat for supermarkets and restaurants wait until the animal dies of old age.

Dear glass gourd lamp I spied at Target on Saturday,
Can I name four people? It would be Marcus Mumford, Country Winston, Ben Lovett, and Ted Dwane—the members of the band Mumford & Sons. I listened to their CD, SIGH NO MORE, over and over and over and over and OVER again, probably five or six times a day for three weeks. Their music is so evocative and heart-rending and redemptive, making it perfect for this story about two brothers learning to forgive each other. These lines from “The Cave” say it all:
“Works of art often tell stories. Artists can present narrative in many ways—by using a series of images representing moments in a story, or by selecting a central moment to stand for the whole story. These lessons will build students' awareness of how stories can be told visually and how artists use color, line, gesture, composition, and symbolism to tell a story. Students will interpret and create narratives based upon a work of art and apply what they have learned to create works of art that tell a story.” The J. Paul Getty Museum
Mildred responds to that by saying she was hoping this would be something Veda would be proud of. Sigh. What a sad life this woman has—everything she does is just so she can get her kid’s approval, which is so, so wrong.
Van Gogh lead an interesting life filled with bouts of illness and insanity, but no one can deny he lived with passion. Something beautiful lived inside of him and it came out of his paintbrush, with purpose and chaos. Perhaps it was his way of sorting out the mess in his head, where everything splintered between reality and imagination. Somehow the two sides of him collide in erratic mosaics in bold colors. Each stroke is a mad dash that makes no sense, but when it connects to the rest, a cascade of wonder fills the canvas.
Ideally apply a primer first, especially if you are prone to oily skin. Smashbox photo finish primer gives a lovely velvety finish as does Mac photo fix but there are cheaper alternatives. Loreal Studio Secrets and Rimmel Fix and Perfect primer also work well. Apply to areas under the eyes and around the nose as this is where make up tends to slide.

Wearing bigger shoes only exacerbates the situation. Larger socks blind the foot, but the resulting shrinkage in offset by sock costs. A certified doctor at the prestigious National Institute of Socketry recently released the results of a 2007 study confirming just that.

The Geej has long enjoyed role-playing type play. She's had a variety of characters in the past--Lisa, Karla, and some mysterious creature named Norway come to mind. However, they were always just variations on a theme. Each one was an older "Mommy" character who (surprise!) worked where I work, was married to Daschel and had a baby named Sally. She is always dressed kind of fancy and wears high heeled shoes. She also likes talking on the cell phone and is harassed frequently by a very demanding boss.

I'm not the one who fears yeast because I was never made to fear one!

To me, baseball is the only sport where on any single day, any single game, any single play, you have the opportunity to witness something you have never seen before. There’s always electricity in the air that can’t seem to be duplicated with any other sport.

Lord and God of my fathers, rend my heart in beauty and in pain. May my tears pour forth when a child is abused and may they pour forth as well when a rainbow graces my vision. In Braveheart the fighters were called “warrior poets” and that is what I want to be. May evil men know that I will not sit idly by while they carry out wicked plans, and may the smallest children and the weakest adults know that I love them and fight for them as a crying warrior sustained by the rainbows and sunrises of his creator.
And finally, Chapter Five includes a discussion of various proposed tax reforms. Romney is intrigued by a Fair Tax (a national sales or consumption tax of 25-30%), but he is reluctant to endorse something so revolutionary because of critical uncertainties – such as whether people quit buying things just to avoid taxes. At a minimum, he would want to structure the tax to avoid a windfall to the rich and a hit to the middle class. Romney hates a value-added tax because he thinks government would use it to supplement its income instead of using it to eliminate the income tax. (Indeed, as I write this note, it appears the Democrats are planning that.) Romney’s preferred tax plan would be to simplify the code, eliminate taxes on middle-class savings, and consolidate corporate and individual taxes on the same money.
Overnight the Asian markets were mostly lower -0.8%. Europe opened lower and closed -1.9%. US index futures were relatively flat overnight. At 8:30 monthyl Payrolls were reported lower than expected: +115K vs 120K, but the Unemployment rate dropped: 8.1% vs 8.2%. The market gapped down at the open and continued to decline. By 10:00 the SPX broke below the OEW 1386 pivot range and continued lower. Around 12:30 the SPX hit 1368, bounced to 1372 by 2:00, then remained in that range into a 1369 close.

On its first day, we were just in line for the movie ‘X-Men First Class’. That rainy night, we bought some snack first before we could go inside. Lights were out as expected when we had entered the cinema.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching this story play out - I wasn't sure where it was going, and a few of the twists and turns caught me by surprise. There were enough details to flesh out the context without coming across as a super technical read on cattle ranching and frontier life. Lucy was a delightfully flawed heroine, as was Nate - where most Christian fiction characters come across as perfect (and thus my main problem with a lot of Christian fiction), Lucy and Nate are very human. I could relate to them, and their struggles - it was believable and realistic. And a truly beautiful story. Definitely looking forward to reading more of Coble's novels, if they're anything like this!

Instead they have organized a nearly self-sufficient and orderly civilization in the Glade, a place they've lived (without memories and under control of the Creators) for two years. Fans of dystopian novels, action and survival books will enjoy The Maze Runner.

I’ve done all and there’s no winning combo – it all depends on your current circumstances, where you’re going and for how long. When you’re on your own you dig deep to approach people to find company, friends, travel mates and information. This often better suits a more outgoing person, but is also when the quieter ones really find out what they are made of. It does mean you’ll have a few moments you might have wished were shared, there’s no one to watch your bags when you need the loo and in cases where dorms don’t exist and you’re paying for a room, it costs twice as much if you are on your own. But remember going alone does not mean you will stay alone as there are many new travel friends to be made.

I find myself traveling to Stormwind, the human capitol, on business for the Paladins. It was a three-leg journey, by boat, by bird, by boat. I must say I enjoyed sailing much better than flying, as I still am uneasy with heights. The first boat ride was short and uneventful, from our island to the Night Elves’. The sea was clam that day, and there were quite a few people going to and from Darnassas that day, due to usual trade and other business between our people.

I have a slight fear of 3-D effects in some attractions so I didn't take any glasses. Everyone else loved it though and enjoyed being dry again for a little while.

Is this Gogo or the ghost of Gogo? I’m not saying. Or he might be a pooka pretending to be him—pookas never say goodbye. Suffice to say, the two find themselves, for the first time in their lives, heading off into the unknown. They wind up in Drumclaven and, after an encounter with a policeman who does little to make them feel welcome, they end up seeking sanctuary in “the local chapel of St. Brigid, the patron saint of travellers, fugitives, poets, scholars, chicken farmers, milk-maids and bastards” where the not-too-unkindly priest explains the point of the book:

A few months ago, I wrote a long post about pesto and my 2011 banner basil crop, put a bunch of photos together, and then never got around to actually publishing it all. Here's the short version: That bad luck with basil I had in May? It eventually turned out to be really good. Like well over 5 pounds of basil from 10 plants good. Yes!

Please read the following Administration Gift description and then rate yourself on a scale of 1 through 5 both in passion and experience. This is to help you from ignoring a gift God may have for you. For example you may be high in passion in the gift of miracles but as of yet God has not manifested Himself in that way to you. If all you rated was experience you may skip over this very important passion God has given you. Likewise if you are deeply involved in “service” but are more pragmatic and less passionate about it you may be tempted to ignore developing the gift of service in the way God wants you to.

Low interest rates, a tremendous selection to choose from, and the seasonality of it all makes for an exciting next 60-90 days. My advice to anyone looking to buy or sell is that waiting to be aggressive could be a fatal mistake if you hope to find the best deal. From my experience, the best deals come when more people are competing for them…and that time is NOW!
Another relatively recent development that merits consideration here (and not only within ‘reserved’ Asian cultures) is the application of neuroscience and biometric methods. Although still debated within MR circles, these methods can overcome some of the problems associated with direct questioning. Nevertheless, a potential drawback is scalability in large, lower cost markets with weaker technical infrastructures. Currently, EEG or galvanic skin response measures are relatively costly to implement and technically complex.

And how exactly might NAMA support the economy with its mountain of cash? Step forward the NationalChildrensHospital. Indeed NAMA has submitted plans for a hospital at the site of one of its debtors atElmPark in Ballsbridge, so this project could be funded by NAMA without even overstepping Minister Noonan’s suddenly narrow interpretation of the NAMA Act. But the NAMA cash can be used for far more, it can extend schools, convert pre-fabs to permanent structures, build nursing homes or retirement villages, it could even build a proper prison. As long as NAMA gets paid back by 2020 and, in the interests of maintaining NAMA’s commercial remit, as long as NAMA generates over 1.25% per annum on the use of its funds.

The second I saw that this film came on Netflix, I pooped my pants, very similar to what Baby Bink would’ve done (although they’re 18 now…) . This movie made me laugh so hard when I was younger and I really found it to be an endearing movie for children of all ages. Heck, I’m 21 now and I enjoyed it just as much as when I was 8. The Worton twins are adorable and have great movie presence for how young they are. It may have taken a lot of shots to get those adorable faces to do what they wanted, but they got the right shots. My childhood was not soon forgotten when I watched this movie again. I remembered every part.

For 1994 Senna got his dream move to the Williams Renault squad. With Prost having retired and Mansell competing in IndyCars, this was Senna’s chance to add to his forty-one victories. Sadly the partnership that promised so much never came to fruition. Senna didn’t like the handling of the FW16 and had a miserable first two races. He spun off and stalled his engine in Brazil, chasing down Schumacher’s Benetton. Then he was tipped off the road by Mika Hakkinen into the first corner of the Pacific Grand Prix. Arriving at Imola, Senna had no points, Schumacher twenty.
I rejoice in my suffering, for it has been touched by God. Like a young love's handkerchief: forgotten by the one and cherished by the other.

It feels that way. After several years of wondering about the future of the private school where I have worked for twenty years, I learned the answer today. While the school will continue, the Board of Directors has determined that the budget does not allow for the continued presence of a librarian on the faculty. Even though I reacted with equanimity, inside I am in turmoil. Even though I knew that my time here might be limited, I always thought I would be the one determining when I would say goodbye.
As I trotted to the library last night to return my overdue library books (£30 in fines, thank you very much), I was reminded what a fantastic neighbourhood I live in -- and what a past it's had.

Practically speaking, this doesn't mean I am weighing my kids' ice cream bowls to make sure they get the exact same amount (after all, there is always more ice cream to be had). But it does mean that if one of my kids tells me I am being unfair, I take it seriously. If there is anything I can do to be more fair, I will do it. We will figure it out together. Also, on those rare occasions when I can't possibly avoid being unfair, I will apologize to and sympathize with my child over it, rather than enjoy it.

Choose friends wisely. Look at their life—is it headed in a direction you want to go? Too often friendships are chosen based on one area of common interest—ignoring the other areas.

I have never had this “talk” with my son, and will never need to have it. The experience of seeing one’s father jumped and beaten by racist blacks in a supermarket in an overwhelmingly white neighborhood, blacks who furthermore were in the store for no other reason than to attack a lone white (and who didn’t even feign shopping), not being able to help one’s father, and seeing him arrested, because “respectable” racist blacks lied to the police and charged him with being the aggressor, while no white witnesses would openly contradict them, makes more of an impression than a thousand “talks.”

Even identical twins have something that allows their parents to tell one from the other. It may be a subtle mannerism such as the way one tilts her head a little further to the right than the other, or a physical attribute such as the number of freckles. The trick is to find the trait and identify the person with it.
A secondary benefit could also be improved visibility for the driver, as the front of the chassis and nose will be lower, obstructing the view far less than the very high humped noses of late.
I would put the Sheelagh Shawl in the mindless category, even when knitting it in black, as I am. The pattern is deceptively easy, made up of lace stitches that are a snap to work if you know how to read your knitting, that is, you know where you are in the pattern by looking at the stitches from the previous pattern round. Knitting Sheelagh has been a bit of a saga. I explained how I started the shawl in a previous entry. I started out with 5 full skeins of Knit Picks Gloss Lace yarn in black, a full 2,200 yards of yarn, and didn’t even consider that wouldn’t be enough to finish the shawl. The edging used up almost all of 2 skeins, but I was still certain I had plenty of yarn. Even when I had used up the 3d and 4th skeins, I had no doubt. But when I started working with the 5th skein, I got that sinking feeling. I realized there was no way I’d be able to finish the shawl.

Looking from the front of the diffuser the undercut sidepods and crash structure allow a clear flow of air into the boat tail section of diffuser; this leaves the exposed and probably gains a slight blow effect from the better airflow. This aids through the awkward centre section of diffuser. As yet the rear wing endplate does not extend downwards behind the diffuser, but is attached to the diffuser with two vane-like mounts.

But in recent times, I've been more and more drawn back to a craft I love, to the act of creating things out of clay that will last for centuries. And I miss the people too.

This section was on words of affirmation, of speaking to your spouse in loving ways. One part that he read really struck me. Here is some of it: “Love makes requests, not demands. When I demand things from my spouse, I become a parent and she the child. It is the parent who tells the three-year-old what he ought to do and, in fact, what he must do. That is necessary because the three-year-old does not yet know how to navigate in the treacherous waters of life. In marriage, however, we are equal, adult partners. We are not perfect to be sure, but we are adults and we are partners. … The way we express … desires, however, is all-important. If they come across as demands, we have erased the possibility of intimacy and will drive our spouse away.” (from “The Five Love Languages” – link at right)

In all four images, Kira and the foreground is pretty well exposed, but the sunlit background is blown out. The degree to which the highlights are blown out depends on the metering mode. The spot metering is by far the worst. The only way to salvage these images is to either crop in and minimize the background with blown highlights or else replace the sun-lit background. Many professional pet photographers are making the artistic choice to leave the blown highlights in the background. I am not entirely sure that works for Schutzhund photography, however. This is not to say, all photographs must be totally balanced in color and exposure. Not at all. In the end, it is an artistic choice.

Owed his memory? What does that mean? This example seems to have been written by a person who knows little of grief. In all these months of steeping in the world of grief, I have not heard a single person mention owing the dead person’s memory anything. Memories are all we have left and we treasure them, but we also know that memory is not a living creature to whom we must pay homage. We might feel obligations to those who are gone, obligations such as honoring their wishes as to funerals and disbursement of treasured possessions, but we fulfill those obligations out of love and because we find comfort and continuity in still being able to do things for our loved ones. But owing the memory we have of the person? Doesn’t even make sense.

The message of How Evil Works: Understanding and Overcoming the Destructive Forces that are Transforming America by David Kupelian ($26.00, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon and Schuster) is stark and simple. There is evil in the world and the author believes that your defense against it is the belief in a higher power and the rules for a moral life that are found in the Old and New Testaments. Though Kupelian does base his book on fundamental religious values, the fact is that many Americans do believe in them even as they see forces at work in the nation to destroy it. The value of the book is the way Kupelian confronts and answers questions many Americans are asking. Why are New Age religions becoming popular along with atheism? Why do so many celebrities and public figures that “have it all” end up self-destructing? Why are Big Lies more believable than little ones? Why are boys doing worse in schools today than girls? Why do we think that the only treatment for mental, emotional, and spiritual problems like anger and depression are drugs? These and many other comparable questions about our society and how it is changing for the worse are addressed. You do not have to be “religious” to be concerned and the book is a tad preachy, but it is also a valuable guide to the evil forces at work in our society today.

Specialty gear is available to help us determine how far weve hiked – and in what direction – and other tools are available to help take the guesswork out of purifying water. But there is a another useful tool overlooked by many avid backcountry visitors – the rangefinder.

"Needless to say," the deep-voiced young South American took up the thread of thought where the professor had dropped it in adding an especially fine film of the polishing material to his sheet of the beautiful purple metal, "no such a surface was ever developed. If the attempt to get perfect reflection had succeeded, the results would have been very disappointing, for the airplane must at times pass through or below clouds, and even with a perfect reflection, the outlines of the plane would be visible, for the rough surface of a cloud or a landscape would cause the smooth edges of the plane to stand out as though they were painted a brilliant color. The whole plane would present a sort of blank space, as you mentioned this morning."
My attention was taken at this time by a different matter. That of combat with the "Pink Terror". One advantage the N17 has over the Sopwith Pup is that it carries "two" machine guns.

Later descriptions of the machine render it likely to have been a pantograph, which had been invented at least some two centuries earlier, or at the least an adaptation of one like the physiognotrace, but was perhaps not in common everyday use. Cynthia McKinley described a similar process in use by profile miniature artist James H. Gillespie, who also claimed to have invented a "new optiocal contrivance" which enabled him to draw likenesses in one minute. Although I have not carried out a search at the British Patent Office, I think it rather unlikely that such a patent in Foster's name exists.

There was a spat before Christmas about the excellent Oxford Companion to Beer. Many in the beer blogosphere were queueing up to find errors and cite them as proof that the book is worthless, or at the very least, deeply flawed.

Finally, I want to thank my long suffering family, the Boy, the Girl and the Wife so frequently mentioned and lampooned on this site. Hunter, Madison and Karen, thank you for your patience, your encouragement and for not killing me for some of the stuff I’ve written.
Björkas is the focal point of the band, but this album also sees the band expanding its sound. They’ve added a fifth member Iris Viiljanen on Keyboards and have a new drummer in Yrjö Ylijoki. The keyboards add a subtle new dimension and while there really aren’t any upbeat songs as on previous albums, the arrangements are much more lush sounding and interesting which makes All Black Shirts To Me a real winner and possibly Cats On Fire’s finest record yet.
Tongues have been wagging over the last year or so about what the next stage of Hackgate is likely to be – once the Murdoch criminality has spread to the Sunday Times and The Sun. Former Mailites at the Torygraph are, I’m told, concerned that they might well be the tumbril’s next clients on their way to the Akers guillotine. The subject of their concern, it is alleged, is hacking the Royals.
I know you may tire of my stories of Boots but that kitty was such a dear friend to me. I am going to receive his ashes and bury some in n my yard. We have to work on the yard and what a tribute I can make to him. I am looking for someone to help me design a grave marker. The ones I am finding are absolutely unaffordable!

I used to stay with my Pop during the school holidays. He would take me to museums and on train rides into the city. I enjoyed those stays, and would spend my spare time reading from his library.
Friday: Group 5 extra work, 4 member Team WOD.
We decided to walk to the park near our house, and the girls tried to sell their remaining comic there, and a few stuffed animals, with no luck. It was a beautiful day and everyone was too busy playing! They were satisfied with their sales for the day- $8!- and had fun in the park. :)
The thing is, we wouldn't have traded our time there for anything. Although the earthquake was a low point, the great things that started happening after were amazing high points. It was a great experience to be part of the clean-up. To see the amazing pride and grace and resilience of the Japanese people. To see destruction repaired. To see things rebuilt. To see the outpouring of love from other countries including America. It was great to be a part of that.
12) Blue Screen of Death
When I finally got around to compiling my favorite records of 2011, I couldn't believe what I picked as my number 1. But it was undisputed. Didn't I eventually love every second of 777 Sects? Didn't my eyes fly out of my skull when I cranked Entity? Didn't Immolation's corporate-sponsored riff fest satisfy my secret guitar-squealing fantasies? I thought Ruin Lust blew my mind when I saw them play some ratty basement in the suburbs of New Jersey? WHAT ABOUT ASH BORER, MAN?
Time to monitor the calories, maybe exercise, too.
...so obscure that no one in the real world is likely to stumble upon it anywhere else...
A strange week that seems to have slipped by far too fast. So much to do and even when not working full time I seem to have so little of it. Being a "mom" and home maker is also proving to take its toll on my working hours.
The last one (moleskin) is my admiration journal. It’s new and I just started to use it. I use it when I find a quote in a book that I really like while I am reading. It is still a work in progress but sooner or later it will be filled up.
Cask beer isn't going anywhere, and that's fine by me. Like Martyn Cornell, some of my best beery moments have been around a pint of British cask. But I'm open-minded enough to want to explore other beer cultures and countries, to be interested in what our new wave of brewers are up to. It isn't some butterfly instinct that attracts me to new and shiny things. It's the reality that we're living in a New World of beer, some of it hundreds or thousands of miles away, some of it on the doorstep. Why would I restrict myself to a single form of dispense? It would be like poking an eye out.
Anyway, we left Carlos in the dungeons with Maria, Terrence and the strangely modified creatures he had befriended. We will learn a little more of the strange torch Carlos acquired.
Revenue cutters also were notified to stand in readiness to proceed to the Carpathia, if necessary.. In the event that the Salem had not sufficient coal, instructions were given to dispatch the cruiser North Carolina instead.
I wish more consumers would stop being put off by the Germanic look of wines from this part of the world. I love German wines and know there is great drinking to be had from there, but even if you don’t not everything in a fluted bottle is Germanic in style – other than being relatively light and generally unoaked.

The first six cards in the set (1-6) feature Hank Aaron and his illustrious career. Other topical subsets included in the set are League Leaders (201-208), All-Star selections (331-339), Playoffs cards (470-471), World Series cards (472-479), and Rookie Prospects (596-608). The card backs for the All-Stars (331-339) have no statistics, but form a picture puzzle of Bobby Bonds, the 1973 All-Star Game MVP.

Calcium Hypochlorite, Ca(OCl)₂ is a solid chemical used as a disinfectant and bleaching agent. It is used to store chlorine for long periods of time without having to resort to chlorine gas, which is extremely dangerous if not handled properly. If stored is a room temperature environment away from moisture, temperature extremes and direct sunlight, calcium hypochlorite can last up to a year without serious degradation. Beyond a year the chemical will become weaker with time.

Ms. Morris was the only eyewitness to the crime and her testimony did not implicate Selsor. The evidence against Selsor instead was based on his and Dodson’s confessions as presented through the testimony of two police officers, Officer Evans, a major crimes investigator for the Santa Barbara, California Police Department, and Officer Roberts of the Tulsa Police Department.
More than 25 years ago, Raye Jeanne and I met. Our relationship was progressing fairly rapidly and I was trying to sort out my thoughts about her and us while at the same time feeling an emotional pull in a particular direction. There was a topic I wanted to address with her, but knew that it was a “fish or cut bait” issue and was uncertain about when and how to initiate that discussion.
The Party has to be dismantled and re-named, while at the same time it should work towards unification with the other patriotic/nationalist parties and groups. This would ideally include UKIP and the English Democrats, and also the English Defence League, as well as other smaller groups where feasible, reaching out to all British/English patriots right across the political spectrum of nationalism to establish a single unified fighting force fit to take on the corrupt political establishment in today’s Britain.

I always imagine the interior to be made of giant crayons, bent and molded and reshaped. Like libraries and their contents–offering so much more than books these days–do to our thinking, our imagination, our plans for the afternoon.
Of course one of the major problems with films that go for a found footage feel is the actors. Because the movie is trying to make you believe in the characters, they can’t really use known actors. This can lead to some god awful performances as the film has gone for unknowns, rather than talent. Chronicle strikes a wonderful balance with having great actors, but getting ones relatively new to their career so they have the experience and acclaim in some circles, but won’t be recognised by the average movie goer. In the case of this film it’s all about the trio of teens who find power, as other actors are more dressing for their emotional core.
Nevertheless, here are some pictures!

But a Slog Washington source dismissed the ‘French connection’:
Second meaningful event: Cara (hat tip to you) turned me on to this guy named Cal Newport, who has a blog named Study Hacks. Study Hacks is a career-focused blog that Cal writes primarily with college kids in mind, but which also contains some pearls for us older folks. This post on passion was especially illuminating. I was always uncomfortable with the “chase my passions” option. I can’t say that it’s wrong for everyone, but I can say that it’s wrong for me. As a kid, I would always quit things once they moved to a level beyond my natural talents. It was the same story every time: piano, swimming, Aikido, horseback riding. I think the truth about me is that I want the lifestyle of someone who has put the work in to become an expert in something, but I don’t actually want to put any work in. And I get easily frustrated and down on myself when my performance isn’t preternaturally perfect. That is both immature of me and a recipe for professional disaster. I am a grown woman with a very intellectually challenging interest, which I believe can become a passion with mastery (or at least a high level of competence). In addition, it is a lucrative interest, a globally relevant interest, and I am lucky enough that my current position has everything to do with my interest, and that I have great mentors, who I believe will help me get where I want to go.
You will also notice that the exterior of the house has been freshly refurbished and that the tags and the paint on it is placed carefully and consciously – just the opposite of vandalism. The new organic insulation of Lu15 was paid by the cooperative housing syndication of which Lu15 is a member. The inhabitants tried to redecorate the façade and make it look like back in the late 70ies and early 80ies when Lu15 was still a squatted house. …
During the Vietnam War, which was supported by the AWL's mentor, the renegade Shachtman, it was said by one US General that it was necessary to destroy a village in order to save its people! It was the basis of the slogan "better dead than red". When it comes to Libya and other such instances, the AWL clearly believe that entire nations have to be destroyed by the power of Imperialist military might, in order to save their people. Perhaps, they could put "Better dead than not a friend of Imperialism", on the masthead of their paper.
So much of being a Naturist is a state of the mind. The freedom of our bodies is the outward sign of the freedom of our minds, the relinquishment of the tension and stress that builds during the day.

But the weather is great. And the people are really nice and friendly. I have not felt less respected just because I'm a female, except for being dismissed when I tried to get my temporary drivers license. I try to respect the nationals and their customs. I don't wear a small miniskirt or shorts and a singlet when I go shopping, and when I need to go to official places, like the police station, I will also cover up arms and legs. However, if I', just going across the road to go to the beach, I just wear the small wrap around skirt I got before I left, and my UV top.
But cities live off the countryside, not the other way round. Think of all the great disaster movies: they're right. What will happen in a crisis is everybody will try and escape to the countryside. We are almost wired to relate survival and sustainability with not being in cities. Building the mega-cities where you rely upon transport to get you 30 miles from your suburb into the middle of Shanghai, or where you rely on airplanes bringing you orange juice from Kenya into central London, nice, but not sustainable. It's so fragile, we saw that with the Volcanic ash incident two years ago, in one week we had people in complete panic.
Rehana finds herself a reluctant part in the rebellion, at the request of her son, who joins the resistance movement early on. She stores guns, ammunition, food, medical supplies etc in the house she built as a rental home, which was occupied by an Indian family. When they leave to return to their native country, Rehana sees it turned into a bunker of sorts for the young men in training to commit acts against the invading Pakistani army and also a hospital, as they rehabilitate a severely injured Major, Sohail’s commanding officer. At first extremely resentful of the Major recuperating in the house, fearful for what might happen (not only to her, but to her children) if it is found out, Rehana becomes used to his presence. They get to know each other as he recovers and then one day, he is gone. Like her son, like her daughter, like her tennants, like most people she knows.
These simple crafts sure have made my kids motivated with getting our work done. They enjoy making them---I enjoy doing them. It's a win-win for all ;)
Today was my one free day for eating this week. You could call it my refueling day. I think that plan is working well. I enjoy the freedom and don’t feel guilty because it’s only once a week. If you don’t agree with this plan you better not read below what I had for lunch!
Thanks for your comment. There are two types of “gifts” and it can get confusing. One type of gift is what most people think of when they use gifts. It is a talent or ability. Singing for example would be a “gift” God gave you. The way you can develop that would be to increase in your practice, skill, and performance. Then you could ask God to give you opportunities to serve and use your gift to the best of your ability. Chances are it will be a life long gift that you can use. Teaching, hospitality and encouraging are some of the gifts like this.

Overall, a sense of dumbing down the novel: This is my major complaint overall, but one that is hard to articulate. I got the feeling that where the book aimed for a late-teen to early 20s audience, the film was pandering to younger, ostensibly less-sophisticated viewers. Some of this is evident in/a product of the sanitization and the other factors mentioned above, but it really stuck out to me in the overt explanations of how one gets sponsors by being likable as the only way to do so. In the novel there are various ways tributes get sponsored–often because they are badass killers with a good chance to win (the wealthy Capitolites are betting, remember?). More importantly, like some other elements obviously explained in the film, Katniss mostly has to discover how this works herself rather than being directly told. This is just one element that I think limits how resourceful and smart the film’s Katniss comes across as.
However, her husband Datuk Seri Mohamad Salleh Ismail, who owns the National Feedlot Corporation (NFCorp) with their three children, pleaded not guilty on March 12 to criminal breach of trust and offences under the Companies Act in relation to RM49 million in public funds.
Brilliant Red!. This is a classic red jelly with a hint of orange, it's very pretty and bright but not unique. It does have a great formula and application, like I'm used to from most jellies. This was two coats, and as you can see it still shows a tiny bit of VNL but strangely it doesn't bother me much in this case.

In May 2009 Arnold J held that eBay was not liable as a joint tortfeasor for acts of trade mark infringement, through the sale of infringing products by its users, despite there being, in the judge's opinion, more that eBay could have done to prevent such sales from occurring. However, the judge felt that he could not make a decision as to whether eBay was liable for trade mark infringement as a result of its use of sponsored links on third party search engines and its own site, insofar as they lead people to postings for infringing products, without a reference to the ECJ. Guidance was also sought as to whether sales of testers and unboxed goods constituted trade mark infringement, as well as to the scope of injunctive relief available under Article 11 of the Enforcement Directive.
Perfectly happy southern girl back home in the south where she belongs! I grew up in NC and have moved around quite a bit. Most recently I moved back home to SC from MN where I FROZE for 5 years. I am a goof who never gets enough time to play around my craft room and create little goodies to send to the internets for no other reason than for a random act of kindness. I am currently lucky enough to be in a "semi" retirement and be a stay at home mom. At some point I will return to the working world.....but not today.
I love the idea of being distracted by keeping count. It would be a nice challenge to increase that number at each try. Also, a recovery walk would be oh so welcomed. I love me a walk break.

It is hard to be detached from any powerful life experience, much less a spiritual experience. Spiritual experiences also leave their rasa or effect upon the mind which can be valuable to sustain. Still we should not cling to them. We should learn to view them like the vistas that unfold when we are climbing a beautiful mountain and continue on with our journey until we reach the summit. Never let the experience be more than one’s inner calm or peace.
Visiting a state in west Africa a few years ago, I wandered onto a beach and marvelled at the golden sands and at the sunlight catching on the Atlantic surf. It allowed me to forget for a moment the local news that day of soldiers seizing a schoolboy and pitching him head-first into an operating cement-machine. Almost forget. Then I spotted a group of villagers beating a stray dog to death for their sport. A metaphor of sorts for all that is wrong, another link in a word-association chain that goes something like Famine… Drought… Overpopulation… Deforestation… Conflict… Barbarism… Cruelty… Machetes… Child Soldiers… Massacres… Diamonds… Warlords…Tyranny… Corruption… Despair… Disease… Aids… Africa.
The kids go home but start to notice subtle differences, “Wasn’t the school painted blue, and not green?” and so on. As time goes on, the differences start piling up until there are radical changes, “Since when has my home been located on an island? Dad’s a cross dresser? Obama is Asian? Dragons?”

When the first draft is done it is followed by the inevitable redrafting, rewriting and the editing process. I’m often happier editing, it is a task which I set to without demur, indeed sometimes with relish. I have great faith and belief in both my agent and editor(s). I enjoy solving the problems that the freely written narrative has at first thrown up. I am capable of ruthless hacking back, like a fierce gardener let loose with a sharp pair of shears, or worse, a murderer creeping up behind my now unwanted characters and despatching them painlessly but ruthlessly. I do wonder sometimes if those excised characters wait in limbo for their chance. Perhaps one day they will all demand to be assembled in a story of their own, an odd mix that would be.
I am thankful for this video.

These countries were populated by Turks – – Turks who were once part of the Ottoman Empire – – Turks who still speak Turkish and practice Turkish customs. Turkey, under the AKP, has forged a strong alliance with Iran. This alliance was largely achieved through the workings of the Gulen movement among the Azeri population of Iran who speak Turkish rather than Farsi.
Hello everyone! I'm here today with a tutorial on how to create a hand-stitched overlapped circle background.
When I was in middle school I had a friend who told her mother everything. Including what boys she thought were cute. I was the opposite; I believed that somethings were best kept secret. I think it was then that I became fascinated with secrets. Not just the fact that we keep them, or what they are, but how people think about secrets.
And all the friends that i was telling

The proposals preceding would enable these two banks to commence a meaningful return to the home mortgage market, making a profit on both the management of the loans and a margin on funds borrowed from the ECB. Such profit would go towards restoring both banks to financial stability, reducing the prospect, all too clearly in evidence currently, that the Government might be required to make even more money available to both banks.

In the Bible, Boaz is a type of Christ. How many times in our lives has Jesus given us some “handfuls of purpose”? How often have we needed something; sometimes just a little encouragement? And how often has the Lord come through with exactly what we need, even though to an outsider it may just seem like a small thing? An outsider might just think we’ve “gotten lucky”, but we know that it is the Lord giving us another “handful of purpose”. We should watch for these little blessings from the Lord in our lives and thank Him accordingly.
Believe me, the dirty tricks will come thick and fast, and they will be aimed at both the MEPs and at the party.
I have a couple of books awaiting review at present, but due to the pressures of the course work I find it hard to fit in actually trying books out, which is what I like to do. Last weekend though Anna was bored and I'd finished the washing up with some time to spare so we settled down with '100 beaded flowers, trinkets and charms' to give it a good go. This book has the charms all photographed against cute backgrounds in little scenes which meant I could easily direct Anna to the fairy and fairytale pages to choose something which I felt sure would appeal. I had a necklace which I had previously beaded but wasn't quite the right colour to take further so we decided to add a charm to this- nothing much to loose. The book gives directions for using fine gauge wire to make charms which are clearly charted and ranked by ease of construction. I didn't have any such wire to hand so winged it using beading thread. This did actually work fine though keeping everything flat whilst I sorted out the tension was a bit fiddly. It did mean however that my charm is soft enough to not scratch the skin and is very light.

Brother Oliver believes that the Guardians merely found the kitty’s yowling to be cute, and that they probably had no idea what he was saying. I tend to agree. The Guardians do understand a little Catonese, but not much, and I’m sure this kitty’s drawl would have made it nearly impossible for them to interpret his speech. But Brother Oliver and I both feel very strongly that the story our feline brother told should be shared, as it sheds light on the role that cats played in one of the most widely known events in the history of the American Old West.

I am so glad that Friday finally arrived. A bit of a long week for me but thankful it's come to an end! Even though it's going to be a bit of a hectic weekend, starting to pack and tying up loose ends before I go away, I'm definitely making sure to give myself some serene and calm moments to collect my thoughts. I'm thinking either a coffee and a good book in silence at home, or hot yoga...Hmmm...
write because I enjoy it, so my plans are a bit limiting in that I haven’t given it much thought. I’m pretty humbled that it’s done as well as it has, and chock it up to having received extremely helpful, constructive feedback. Once (if) I make the top five on Authonmy.com and get a review from Harper Collins, I would like to pitch it to an agent and see if it goes anywhere. I do have a sequel in the works, tentatively titled “The Blood Gardens.” Originally, TBG was book one of the series, and Deshay of the Woods was a mere component of that book. I separated it for many reasons, the main one being I liked it as a standalone tale. TBG is written from the POV of two new characters whose story parallels the events of DotW. Eventually, the characters’ paths will cross, but probably not so much in TBG.
Last week I started my first batch of sauerkraut. I used red cabbage, an insult to traditionalists. It is really simple to make and there are many slight variations that people make. I used this instructable as my guide. I basically shredded half a cabbage and added about 3 tbs of salt into my trusty old pickle jar. I then pounded it by hand to release the cabbage juice. I used a water filled jar to weigh it down and then put a loose lid on the jar and put it away in a quiet corner. Here it is after 6 days:

One single event, even if amongst many single events, proves nothing. It may well be that there is no coherent plan to massacre the the white population of South Africa, or any other country. However, that does not mean it will not happen, or, at least, that it will not be attempted. The acts of barbarity which followed hurricane Katrina were not the result of a plan, there was no serious plot to cause the Broadwater farm riots in the 1980's, during which Police Constable Keith Blakelock was hacked to bits. In fact it could be argued that there was no serious, grown up or coherent plan behind what happened in Rwanda, but it still happened.

The main characters Maddy and Queenie are just so amazing. I loved their strength and their frailty, I loved their stiff upper lip and their personality, but most of all I loved their friendship. It is just the best and most beautiful friendship ever. I hope that if it ever came to it I would have the courage they showed. At the end of the day these are girls that you wish you could be like. They are funny, brave, smart and they do the right thing no matter what. Yet they never come across as perfect, or arrogant, or as Mary Sues.

Parents and children feel that they have to turn off the TV, and possibly all the other screens, during this week even though there are often other times when screen time naturally decreases. In our family we recognize that screen time increases as the wet cold Pacific Northwest winter wears on, but we know that as the weather improves we'll all be outside more often and spending less time gathered together on the couch or playing games that involve screens. For some families screen time takes a dramatic dip when they go on vacation, for others it occurs when cousins come into town or it's soccer season. Doesn't it make more sense to turn off the TV when there are other interests beckoning instead of during some arbitrary week that someone who has never met you selected?

Last year also saw the launch of a new annual competition on the west coast. The Canadian Individual Poetry Slam is hosted annually by the Vancouver Poetry House in Canada’s third largest city. It is at the heart of the Vancouver International Poetry Festival, and attracts the top individual slammers in the country. The chance to shine as a standalone slammer at CIPS is an irresistible draw for very best poets to make the trip to BC in April.

I really hope there is very little of me in my characters since many of them tend to be immoral, vicious, bloodthirsty killers, or unwise enough to get themselves into situations where they are maimed or killed. Well, maybe they share my odd sense of humour.

We landed in Amsterdam and caught the railtrain from the airport to town. It was ‘Queen’s Day’ (a bit like our Independence Day, it was explained to us) – a national holiday. The streets were full of Clemson Orange (although they tried to convince us that this had something to do with their Queen.)
However, the idea that business battles against a tide of risk assessment forms every year is not one that the evidence seems to support. The vast majority of employers never carry out any kind of written risk assessments. And for those that do, there is easy-to-understand advice available from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) on how to do them. Over time the assessments have become well established and familiar.

What is an age statement? It is a declaration of the whiskey's minimum age that appears on its label. 'Minimum' means that the stated age has to be that of the youngest whiskey in the bottle. Older whiskey is okay but nothing younger than the stated age is permitted. Age statements are regulated by the Alcohol Tax and Trade Bureau, a branch of the U.S. Treasury.

Of course preparing an artichoke is a little more time consuming than throwing a bunch of vegetables together in a stir-fry. Look at it as a labour of love.

Still, it had turned away more easily than expected. Easily enough that stopping was going to be the hard part of this jump. Pevan tightened her grip on Jashi, burrowing tightly against the other woman, pressing into her shoulder for the sense of comfort. It was a psychological trick; she'd feel safer, and so concentrate harder.
Have you every sung a rhyme?
Often the “desires of the sinful nature” and the acts of the sinful nature are equated only with sexual immorality. Paul’s list starts with that category. And that was undoubtedly a real problem in the Galatian churches. All churches seem to be plagued to some degree with sexual immorality. But it is likely that Paul began there because he knew that most of the church would quickly condemn those who were guilty of sexual immorality and yet consider themselves “safe,” since they had performed the “works of the law” by getting circumcised (5:2) and observing special days (4:10). Paul then turns to these “lawkeeping” Christians and gives them a long list of flagrant acts of the sinful nature which they had committed. This is something like the story of the woman caught in adultery (Jn 8:1-11). The teachers of the law were ready to stone her. But Jesus said that only those without sin could stone her. Then he began to write on the ground. What he wrote we don’t know. But those teachers of the law were convicted of their own sin and left her.
Well, I’m Fragile now – I could tell you how but ….I have no time to speak
One aspect of Islamic society and Islamic states is the conflicts which often arise between the Islamic ulemas within a Muslim/Islamic state and the state itself. To put it simply. This war between ulema-power and state-power (a perennial battle in, for example, Pakistan) is often addressed in the language of freedom and even of democratisation; whereas it is often the case the it is only a struggle between two power blocks – the state and the ulemas.

May I go so far to say that the idea of instructions, is to follow them, and that the voluntary decision to follow them is a “covering” for us, a protection over us. Similar to the ark of Noah “covered” with a “covering” (pitch). The slab of gold on the Ark of the Covenant is not a “mercy seat” but a cover, a symbol of the firmament over the earth. The Day of Atonement is the Day of Covering, when the Ark-cover is covered with blood and the High Priest receives his clothing back again. “Make atonement” means “cover.” All of these covers relate to the firmament-cover over the world, the clothing put on Adam and Eve after they sinned, and the clothing of the High Priest, to mention but a few. Such coverings before God obviously relate to propitiation, cleansing, atonement, and the like, but the fundamental idea is that of covering, of being rightly clothed before God. The Christian, understanding that we must be hidden in Christ, clothed by Him, before we dare to approach God, will have no trouble grasping the deep significance of such coverings that come about through instructions.
First the Group Invites. I don't mind these too much unless you are sending the same group invite week after week. I do want to hear about your group, and if it interests me I'll join, but it is somewhat irritating when you get invited to join the same group every week and every week I decline. I don't know if there is a way to stop this, or to block the invites. The only way I discovered to get rid of those invites permanently was to drop the friend who kept sending them. I hated doing that, but honestly I felt like I was being spammed.
So we huddled in Charlotte. We didn’t like the failure rate. However, the app was installing correctly other than wiping out a database on 1 out of every 5 systems. To stop the installs meant having to take the 20 we had installed back to their base image. That was time consuming. Also, we knew we’d just be back in a few weeks later, working yet another Saturday. We didn’t want that. We knew we could fix the problem when we encountered it, but checking the database was time consuming. However, the sync process was something that most of our end users ran nightly anyway, so you could run it on a perfectly healthy, but unmodified database. And there we had our answer.

In Jacob Teitelbaum's new book, Beat Sugar Addiction Now, he helps you to identify if you have a sugar addiction, what sort of addict you most likely are, and how to overcome your addiction. The book is simple to navigate and is very thoughtful laid out. In Part 1, you will determine what sort of sugar addict you are...ranging from Type 1-Type 4. He uses simply questionnaires that are designed to determine how sugar is interacting in your life.
The four princes making up what they call the League of Princes are Prince Liam (Sleeping Beauty's Prince Charming), Prince Frederic (Cinderella's Prince Charming), Prince Duncan (Snow White's Prince Charming), and Prince Gustav (Rapunzel's Prince Charming). The girls became famous in the tales as they swept through the land, while the princes were demoted to a mere "Prince Charming." And Happily Ever After isn't what you expect, either. Sleeping Beauty, for example, is horribly vain and not fun to be around. Cinderella, on the other hand, is one of my favorite characters in the entire book. She's a spit-fire. She didn't escape life with her stepmother and stepsisters only to be holed up in a castle for the rest of her life. She wants adventure, she needs to explore. She goes off on a journey and Prince Frederic, who has been sheltered his entire life, goes off to find her. Along the way, he meets his merry band of Prince Charmings, and together they encounter trolls and dragons and Bandit Kings intent on destroying them creating a fun, fast-paced adventure sure to please all ages, especially upon discovering a dastardly witch's plot to steal the land's bards and slaughter any hero who comes to save the day.

I need prayer for help in taking the higher road. Because ultimately God loves those who don’t know the impact of their words, and I’m sure I have annoyed someone, too, with my tactless and blunt ways. That, and Paul had to minister with a thorn in his side. What makes me different or special? What makes me deserving of a smoother way? God never promised it would be easy and the other week was no different.
It does that and the rest.
If Miles is “difficult,” it is because his honesty and candor are such rare traits in the show business world that few people know how to deal with him. His monumental disdain for the complimentary small talk and instant familiarity that entertainers are exposed to, and his absolute refusal to indulge in such trivia, has earned him the reputation of being unapproachable. “I have found,” observes Altshuler, “that when Miles meets someone new—people from the press I’ve introduced him to—he will check them out first. They don’t always know this, but Miles is actually laying down the ground rules for a totally honest exchange of questions and answers, and he will accept his interviewer only if he can be sure that his time is not going to be wasted with inane questions.” As one might expect, Miles is reluctant to appear on TV talk shows.
Whoa! Ever since my 14k I have been seriously slacking! One week I only did 2 body rock days! 2! There are ONLY 5! Not to mention I only did 3 last week! This week, even with me feeling oh so crappy/kind of running a temperature, I did my body rock. I did my measurements and they have stayed the same. I need to get back on the wagon! No more excuses tomorrow I am back at the gym.

I glued a magnet to each of the four corners on the back of each frame. (The magnets I bought at Hobby Lobby.) I had the brilliant idea of using Super Glue to attach the magnets to the frames. No matter how careful I was, I ended up with glue on my fingers EVERY SINGLE TIME! (At least I had sense enough not to touch my sticky fingers together or to scratch myself.)

I’ve been having some problems lately and classifying them as “not that bad” even though I know I really ought to get help. My employer offers this assistance program where they (the program, not my employer) refer me to a mental health specialist, who will give me six or so free sessions. I really have to do this. I’ve run down the list of my symptoms and looked online, and I don’t think I can be diagnosed with anything– which is good because I don’t want to be medicated. At the same time, though, I am aware that I have been self-medicating, and not in a way I can justify as healthy, like being addicted to working out or eating vegetables or something.

For example, how wide should the context of any given Koranic passage be? The context of the surrounding sentences? The context of the whole sura from which it is taken? Or perhaps the context of the entire Koran? Perhaps culture and history should be brought into the equation too. In that case, I would need ten or more years study in order to become an Islamic scholar. Only then could I justify my selected passages from the Koran.
I marvel at how many home comforts can be fitted into such a small space. (That's the same small place that is going to become very claustrophobic.) We have a double berth, wardrobes, our own shower and 'head' - that's boating speak for toilet. I am instructed in the art of flushing the said head, although pumping and draining would be a more accurate description of this process. I get the hang of it eventually. After 3 days.
-o- I am an early riser and would be supremely happy if I could be in bed by 10 pm every night. I envy night owls and cherish the random times I wake during the witching hour, but I am at my best in the morning. There was one year during college in which I’d fall asleep at eight or nine, wake up at four, read in the bathtub with pillows and blankets until six, and then sleep again until eight or so. Some of my favorite reading experiences are from that year; such as the time I read The Old Man and the Sea for the first time and in one go while the rest of the East Coast was sleeping.

It's all really exciting. So the next point is that this blog from now on (if I really even attend to it.. we will see in time), is to briefly chronicle what is happening in our world. I am a bit motivated by the outward approach that Tucker Max (Taylor Steele) has taken with the creation and release of his film, I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell. So in that light, I may take an active approach to regurgitating the information and events that will ultimately lead to Day 1 Opening.
We deliberately use this phrase "with the addition of other means" because we also want to make it clear that war in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it into something entirely different. In essentials that intercourse continues, irrespective of the means it employs.Changing the "by" into "with" completely changes the meaning of Clausewitz's aphorism, making war an overall part of the political process, and not something separate from it.
I think it is nothing but a “poverty tour.” Slumdog twists the reality of the slums to fit its story line.

My last hoppy beer is finished so I must have a replacement...
I get out of bed quietly; careful not to disturb my sleeping family. I creep downstairs, open the blinds, turn on the monitor, and pump. Because Bram is sleeping through the night, I’m able to pump 10 ounces in 15 minutes. It feels good to pump. I can make a big weekend bottle for Bram and two freezer bags for G. Then I get started on breakfast. I know that R doesn’t like overly complicated foods first thing, so I make a simple egg scramble with hash browns and gluten free toast. There’s fresh-squeezed juice and freshly brewed coffee (with real local cream for Renee and coconut milk creamer for me). I set the table with placemats and napkins, and I cut a quick bouquet of flowers from the garden for the center of the table. I turn on NPR very quietly in the background. The morning sun is warm and relaxing. All feels right in our tiny cottage.

But he isn't saying it, not once has he really pressured me into finishing this. I'm the only one who's frenzied about this entire thing that I shouldn't be talking about. I want to get it done, I don't even know why at this point. It could fail, it probably will fail; whatever we do usualy fails and I already have people telling me that it will with out a doubt fail. Yet I still push on, sit in my little room and keep putting more work into this dam thing.
But they can generate magic moments! In France I’ve been to several medium to bad milongas, but certainly I have danced some super tangos, that broadened my perception of the dance and took me further ahead. That could be the ‘French touch’! And also there are some people who dance well and study tango a lot. And this is the moment when the free, open, creative spirit is combined with skills and talent that can reach perfection. Like some of the excellent dancers I met in the Milonga de 4 Saisons! Allez! On va danser!

Fans will also have an opportunity to see two of the great guards go at it as Cappie Pondexter and rookie-sensation Maya more are slated to face off.

Before we get on to the challenge I would like you all to welcome a new addition to the team - Trace Metcalfe of inkypinkycraft as a full time member of the team. You can read all about Trace and the rest of the team on the Meet the DT page.
At the weekend Bob went home. Water was heated on the fire and a tin bath was filled. He took half his dirty clothes home for washing and left them until the following Saturday when he brought the second half and so on…. Out of his five shilling wage he paid an insurance premium to cover if he needed a doctor. There was no pension deduction as there was no state pension at this time.

But, you must not hate your body either. You must take care of your body, so that you may live long on the earth for the Lord.
And I especially love that I was able to birth my beautiful boy without interventions and can focus more on learning to be a mother than on making it through my own recovery. I'm so glad my spine remains unviolated by an epidural and my bottom wasn't victim to an episiotomy. I have no hemorrhoids from pushing because I was able to push from an advantageous position and have every push be an effective one. Many hospitals would have stuck my poor baby every hour for a blood sugar value due to his size, even though I had good prenatal care and tested negative for gestational diabetes.
I make sense
I didn’t think we were going to be able to get Hippie Child back to the boat, she disappeared out to sea, happily bobbing up and down. Taking shots with her new underwater camera she realised she had lost her family but figured snorkeling was too much fun too worry about the old fogies.
Exciting!!!
My question for this week is, Was the fight worth it? I ask because when women got the right to vote, most of them (I've read) voted the way their husbands did. I don't think that is necessarily the case today, but after the pain "Missus Pankhurst" went through, don't you think we ought to take advantage of our right to vote? Why do so many stay home on voting days, especially if the weather isn't perfect? So I ask, Was it worth it?
“The satisfaction of the prank-maker is the humiliation of the victim,” declared the Frenchman. “He has joy in the lady’s blush; he has delight in the gentleman’s discomfort. A man who is respectable for many years may suddenly snap – zat! – like the elastic. I regret to have seen many such cases in Provence.”
And that is all. You're welcome.
For me - well if you read my previous blog you already know the answer. I never drink beer by the pint or even the half pint. I knew if there were any beers that I was going to get excited about they would definitely have an abv over 6% and a third of pint glass would be perfect to enjoy the aromas and flavours of a strong beer.
Recycling of the usual items PLUS E-waste, Batteries, etc.
So now we get to the frustration part. I can see my quilt design in my head (actually if I'm honest I can see a number of quilt designs in my head) but I just don't seem to be able to get the design from my head to a quilt. I find it really frustrating. I always start by trying to transfer what's in my head onto paper, but even that's not such a sure thing!
Somehow, I made it to the hostel. No elevator, of course. I drag all my luggage to the room... and the room, if you can picture it, looks like this: plastic chair - empty space - window - bunk bed - locker. At this point, I started asking myself: did you really have to do this, Tanja? Did you really need this trip to NYC to happen? Can't you just wait until you get a real job, earn some real money and actually afford a hotel when you travel?
Kidding aside, my gut was doing flip flops while he informed us that he had already spoken with her, she was not going to protest the committal, she knows she needs help. I asked if we had any hope getting her into another facility besides the State Hospital, he said no, a committal, because it is ran through the State Health and Welfare Department, this was her only option, but once she is released and pronounced stable, we have the option for another RTC that we as parents would see fit. The difficulty is that because she is 18, anywhere she goes, unless she is committed by a judge, she can walk out of.
That’s 74.695 days, which I will round down to 74.
And I certainly would tell them where they could stick their gum.
But we know that Lindy has capabilities, as does her English teacher. It's just that, like so many children, she has had a rotten start in life.
Upon eating a bunch of sugar, our body has a sharp rise in glucose levels - the body sees the high amount of sugar and panics - it goes into emergency mode and works hard to burn it up. Then you have the crash.
A random afternoon of antiquing is also incredibly inspiring to me...I love browsing through carefully salvaged relics of the past and imagining their history...there is something so romantic and intriguing about it to me.
Sometimes the girls wear the apron. I have to tie it in the back so it's not too long. Caroline is only four years away from the age I was when Suzanne gave it to me. Over the years I forgot where the apron came from. I simply grabbed it, tied it on and began cooking. It wasn't until Caroline asked me about it last week that I remembered. I wonder if Suzanne remembers giving it to me. I'll make a note to ask her.
● DEMOCRATS ATTACKED FURTHER
I've been craving fish lately and so I rummaged through my refrigerator to see what could be created without going to the grocery store in the middle of the night. I flipped through my Taste of Home Cookbook and compared it with the ingredients on hand and decided to make the Crawfish Etouffee, using shrimp instead. Hence, my blog post title - Shrimp Etouffee.

Again, if you haven't read this yet, controlabuseofpower.org article: "Trial lawyers who represented the states during the tobacco lawsuits of the 1990s were scheduled to receive contingent fees of $750 million per year for the first five years and $500 million annually thereafter, in perpetuity. Estimates as to the total amount they will get vary from $10 to $15 billion to as much as $30 billion."

Now Melis is the last one who knows the truth. And someone is determined that the truth will die with her.
Small talk has several different topical choices, none of which I excel at discussing. It might be a chat about kids, a talk about the recent weather patterns, or a serious conversation regarding a recent news event. Most often the subject turns to less important subjects, such as sports. Well, I suppose I should say “less important to me.”
On the night of January 28, 1974, the Death Angels dramatically upped the ante, shooting five whites, four of whom died, in five separate attacks.

Another problem/concern I have is with cell phones. Every time you turn around it seems a new cell phone model is coming out. My cell phone is a relic from a bygone era. I got it in the early 2000's and I've used the same pay-as-you-go plan since then, costing me about $25 every 2-4 months. To be clear, it's not my primary phone source, it's just for emergencies or the occasional on-the-go call and I'm fully aware that it would be a whole different ball of wax if it was my primary source of communication. But that being said, it works for me, even if it is clunky and (very) old-school!
However, sometimes, as was the case yesterday, I fight it long enough that I actually beat it. I eventually lose the feeling of tiredness and I continue reading. This is not always a good thing, especially if I only wanted to finish the page, because after my initial chance, I find sleep to be an elusive and ferocious beast: Finding it become harder the more you search and when finally found its fight instinct forces it to pounce on you with vicious claws and biting teeth. In a situation like this I always find myself ‘kicking’ myself out of sleep once it envelops me. A side note that I will not elaborate on, I have occasional sleep paralysis and sleep apnea.
And did I mention I can get calls and texts in a couple of places I couldn’t before? Yep…
One who can actually see that despite activities there are no karmic reactions, who understands the nature of akarma actually sees things as they are. The word akarmaṇi refers to one who is trying to avoid the reactions of karma. By dovetailing his activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, although one may perform all kinds of activities, he is free. On the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, Arjuna engaged in fighting, and those on the side of Duryodhana also engaged in fighting. We must understand how it is that Arjuna is free from reaction whereas Duryodhana is not. Externally we can see that both parties are engaged in fighting, but we should understand that Arjuna is not bound by reactions because he is fighting under the order of Kṛṣṇa. Thus when we see someone working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we should understand that his work does not carry any reaction. One who can see such work and understand it is to be considered very intelligent (sa buddhimān). The technique is not so much in seeing what a person is doing but in understanding why he is doing it.
You have to know a few things about ecosystems if you want your fantasy worlds, with the animals and whatever type of life inhabits the world, to be cohesive.
Actually, what I love to call “garden” in reality is a tiny suburban backyard. It makes me happy to realize that even with so little space I manage to grow tomatoes, cucumbers, green beans, onions, and herbs.
Well, rehearsals have gone well and The Ancient One has begun to believe that he really is Grandpa Martin Vanderhof in Hart and Kaufman's Pulitzer Prize winning play, You Can't Take it With You. (YCTIWY) This production opens Friday at Manhattan Beach Community Church and will be there for 5 performances (October 15, 16, 17, 22 & 23). This character and play are so much fun. And it has been wonderful working as part of such a great ensemble cast.

Myofascial Self Release – This is my personal favorite type of stretching. Myofascial is a type of massage that you can give yourself. It typically involves foam rollers (see picture) and/or other props that use your body weight to roll down the length of the muscle you wish to “massage”. This is great particularly for runners with tight IT bands (which can cause hip and knee problems). While it won’t cause flexibility, it will release your muscles, so it becomes easier to stretch and develop that awesome flexibility you’re craving!

There were skirmishes during the march, 19 people were treated for injuries and police said eight people were­ ­arrested, “mostly for possession of offensive ­weapons and assault”.
A grass fire came in from the west, devouring tinder dry yellow grasses. Giant orange flames raced across open plains and along dry riverbeds. They tiptoed through the open woodland where the elephants had trampled the grasses, then raced out into the sunlight again. The wind was their friend, urging them onwards. But the wind is capricious and finally it turned. The flames stumbled and stuttered trying to find a new way forward, but they were stumped and the fire died right there.It has left a desolate landscape where burnt leaves shiver and shift on the ground, crumbling to soot and rising in dusky columns to dance with the dust devils of their old friend the wind.
With only the faint scent of you remaining.

Amid all the faffing about Greece and its referendum (on which you might be surprised to hear that I don't actually have an opinion) there are little articles slipping in here and there which are frankly 100 times more worrying than the economy.

It’s that time of the quarter, midterms are finally here! Midterms, unlike finals, have nothing going for them. After you take a midterm you are then sentenced to 5 more weeks of hw and then finals pay you a visit soon after. When your done with finals you can at least look forward to some type of break.
His feature directing debut came in 1955 on the musical Bring Your Smile Along. He directed a few more films but the one that was his first standout was 1959's Operation Petticoat starring Cary Grant and Tony Curtis.

That's OPI's Princesses Rock! for me. I desperately wanted a pale, shimmery barely there pink for occasions that warranted subtle nails. This is just a hot mess. I've tried it alone, over light pinks, over whites and over nudes. I have a VNL (visible nail line) every time and the shimmers don't show up very often. I love this polish in the bottle but on me it just doesn't work :(
I’ve been thinking for months now that we would give potty training a first shot over the kids’ Winter Break, because it would be a time when I could stick close to home and exercise the consistency needed to sit Finn on the toilet at very regular intervals. I say “first shot” because in all honesty, I’m trying to approach this with an open mind, meaning I accept that it’s probably going to take multiple attempts.
This jet black brew pours with a sturdy brown head you could almost walk across. It's a very rich oatmeal stout, with plenty of roasted malt goodness, with a little chocolate note and a noticeable oat character. For all that roasted malt, it's quite smooth and not all that bitter, creating a highly drinkable, yet substantial stout.

Most of all, I am going to remember that Daniel Morcombe's parents would give the world to have their son awake all night. They would absolutely love to be sent a note home, asking for late homework. They would do anything, to have pyjamas dropped on the floor; milk spilled on the bench; a fight between siblings to break up; to be late for school; to have to make lunch boxes at midnight; to find a forgotten, fruit-squished excursion notice in the bottom of a school bag; to endlessly pick up Duplo; to watch the Teletubbies for the 473rd time.
p309-311 “An ancient Zen master said: ‘Being-time stands on the topmost peak and in the utmost depths of the sea, being-time is three heads and eight elbows, being-time is a height of sixteen or eighteen feet, being-time is a monk’s staff, being time is a hossu, being-time is a stone lantern, being-time is Taro, being-time is Jiro, being-time is earth, being-time is sky.’

It snowed that Christmas on Vancouver Island. Outside, his beautiful garden lay peacefully hushed in its pristine white blanket, a rare event for that area. Struggling to breathe, he lay inside on his hospital bed overlooking the garden. Gazing out on the snowy landscape, he fully aware of the poignant symbolism of his precious garden held in winter’s grip.
Work was hard. Super stressful. And, not worth the money. I was so tired and frustrated and all I could feel, at the end of the day, was the little fuzzy strands rubbing the back of my collar. My skin was crawling.

But even as I type this, I'm getting all choked up thinking about having another baby and then it won't be just me and my DD anymore. We have such a close bond and the time together is priceless. Its hard to think of another baby interfering with our time together, but I know it will work out fine. Its just a lot to think about. But thankfully, I have plenty of time to come to terms with it. Who knows how long it will take to get preggo next. It took us a year the first time, and with Hubby being gone at trainings lately, and the upcoming move and added stress, it should give me the extra time I feel I need for now.
It sounded impossible at first with my schedule but thanks to my dearest friends, brother, and sister in law who were willing to help in any way to make it possible, you guys are the best! The inside is red velvet cake with cream cheese icing, covered in white candy melts and purple polkadots. I was dying to make a sheep or a cow or anything farm animals for these cakepops, but they take so much time to do, so maybe next time. Anyone having a baby anytime soon?

I don't generally scrapbook, but decided it would be nice to try it out and do something nice with my holiday photos, and I just couldn't resist starting it off with this beautiful little lady. She is about 5 months old and lives with her brother (and owner!) in one of the apartments where we stayed - both kittens were born blind but it didn't seem to be a problem whatsoever for them, and they had such beautiful and gentle natures. It was amazing watching them play together - you would swear they could see!
Without further adieu, here is the card I made with Wednesday "Sara" Addams.

Leave the potatoes unpeeled. Put them in a pot of salted water and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and keep at it until the potatoes are tender. This takes 30-45 minutes. Drain them and rinse with cool water so you don't scald your fingers in the next step. Fill the pot with water and bring to a boil.
The decorations were awesome. Hope really believes it's in the details, which she does a great job accenting.

The near-simultaneous appearance of three new literary biographies offers a powerful and concentrated challenge to the habit of undervaluing the short story. The subjects of these lives — Flannery O’Connor,John Cheever, Donald Barthelme — all produced longer work as well, but their reputations rest on shorter work. And this work, far from being minor, is among the most powerfully original American fiction produced in the second half of the 20th century.
