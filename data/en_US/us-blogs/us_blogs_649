Correspondents in the Church of England Newspaper in the early part of 1995 reflected on the Evangelical Leaders Conference held in January of that year, when the definition of evangelical was raised once again. Those committed to the inerrancy of Scripture were criticised and it was insisted that the true evangelical must leave room for the humanity of the Biblical writers. It was a controversy sadly reminiscent of the separation of the Inter Varsity Fellowship from the Student Christian Movement in the 1920s. The so called open evangelical is apparently ready to accept not only errors in the Bible but contradictions between Jesus and Paul, together with serious ambiguities about moral guidance. 1996 saw the publication of Strangers and Friends, written by a professing evangelical so open that he is able to grant biblical validity for homosexual practice.

First of all, going to the gym often means getting up early, which is clearly a problem. A cappuccino machine would be an obvious way to improve the gym experience. In fact, a cappuccino machine is obviously far more important than the stupid water cooler often found in gyms. Duh.
To me, this is a way that whether you are traveling, or at home and somehow you were to lose your dog, anyone can look up all the dog's info, see a picture of the dog, and lists other numbers to call in and out of state. For instance, I chose to put my phone number and each of their names on their tags. Their link also has my daughter's phone, my sister's phone in CA, you get the idea.

In 1979 they were ready to record a full length album. But none of the studios in Austin would work with them, so they found a place in San Antonio that let them lay down the tracks live to tape. It was all done in a single take with the songs being recorded one after another. Afterward, the engineer broke the songs up and played them over the studio speakers. Satisfied with what they heard, they yelled "Fuck the wankers!" and darted home to get drunk.

Not unlike childbirth, the ice bath is one of those uncomfortable experiences that you remember as painful, but cannot quite conjure the extremity of it until you do it again. Yesterday afternoon I filled my tub with cold water, filled a large pitcher with ice, made a cup of hot peppermint tea and grabbed an oversized hoodie. At this point I ask that you do your best not to picture me naked, but if you must, please note that when nude I look surprisingly like Angelina Jolie sans tattoos. I stayed clothed from the waist up in a tank top and that warm hoodie. I set my tea on the edge of the tub, knowing it would warm me from the inside out. I stuck one foot in the tub and then stood there--it was a painful shocking sensation- as if I stepped barefoot into a snowbank. I pulled my other foot off of the floor and went to submerge it but I just couldn't. I just stood there balanced on one foot like a flamingo. Every time I went to put my foot into the water it was if it had a mind of its own--there was no way it was going in. I probably could have stood in that position for hours, but let's face it, I had just run 13 miles (14 if you include the mile we ran just to get to the start line) and there was no way I could balance like that forever. Finally I gave in and stood with both feet in the cold, cold water. I thought about frostbite, and stupidity and the fact that I was an idiot for trying. I stood there for about five minutes when I finally became brave enough to sit....

If I could only pick one kind of cookie to eat for the rest of my life, I’d probably go with Chocolate Chip. They’re simply classic. And, since there’s a thousand different ways to make them, it’s like eating a different cookie each time! I’ve got my favorite recipe that I turn to time and time again, but I realize that they don’t really fall into the “quick and easy” category. Not everyone has cake flour and bread flour always hanging out in their pantry, and they take a bit of time. Which is a problem when you want to shove cookies in your face 5 minutes ago. So I’ve been on a never ending search for the quick and easy chocolate chip.

Pharmacy benefit managers sell mail order pharmacy to employers as a way to lower medication expenditures. PBMs offer their own mail order service for 90-day supply maintenance medications. Mail order pharmacies are owned by PBMs creating an inherent conflict of interest. The language in pharmacy benefits contracts requires the use of the mail order pharmacy for and allows the mail order pharmacy to charge the employer more for a medication than if the same medication was filled at retail pharmacy. PBMs earn 22% of their revenue from selling prescriptions from their own mail order pharmacies. Our reporting software is able to detect this waste and overpayment to employers allowing them to make an informed decision about the cost effectiveness of requiring mail order for maintenance medications.

Indie vs Traditional: When it comes to reading and reviewing books, we don’t discriminate between independently published eBooks, small press printings, and traditional on-the-shelf novels. If it catches our attention, we’ll give it a go. What this means, though, is that we have the same picky standards, no matter what we’re reading. It also means that few indie books are picked up and reviewed; there’s stiff competition for our attention, and only so many hours of sleep we can trade-off for a good read.
It was during this turbulent time that I met Hubby, and we began "seeing each other". Don't know what he saw in me, but he seemed to think I was worth saving. When I first moved down to the little island here in 2003, I had still not resolved my emotions regarding Dad's death. Deep inside, the Hate still ruled me and ate away at me like a cancer.

I love simple, clever, problem-solving ideas like the Solar Suitcase– and I’m not alone.

The difficult part is making a habit out of using reusable shopping bags to the point where it’s almost innate. It’s like running, you don’t think about every minute detail of the action.

I'm still not sure how that phone call went.

The reality? The routes pass in front of some of the most expensive hotels in London to allow those who have bought premium packages to be taken, bascially at our expense, straight to the venues in air conditioned limousines. Anyone caught using these lanes for any other purpose, maybe like work or education God forbid, will be caught (doubtless by a CCTV system that can't identify murderers), fined 200 pounds and probably CS gassed in the face as potential terrorists for good measure.
Now, my second letter…it is to Sister Someone (again, is anyone surprised?). Let me state now that yes, she is still a member of the Panel but like we do with Cuz and Buddy…she will be left alone until she is ready to change her situation and that may never happen, and for real, she needs to change her mindset also. She is so blinded by her need to realize her dream of a family and so ruled by her lust for Brother Everything, she is endangering herself, her child and her job/finances. But, she is not going to listen to anyone….if you tell her what she does not want to hear, she tunes you out. According to her, she is in her joy and she is living her life to please herself, not others. I give it 4-6 weeks before her alternate personality comes forth to cry and ask what happened and how did she end up here.

This was certainly evident in the first beer I tried, the Peter Brown Tribute Ale, named after a former sales manager for the brewery who passed away nine years ago. It was impressively clean and smooth, brewed with molasses and brown sugar that blended seemlessly with the light coffee flavors and nuttiness of the malt. And who says Bear Republic cannot make a balanced IPA, as Linda enjoyed their Endeavor IPA, with "only" 65 IBU's which had a lovely soft, biscuit-like, and lightly fruity hop character, which Linda and I prefer over Racer 5.

If it so please the Elkron, be thou thusly blessed!” said Johan in a dignified whisper until the latter part where he sputtered along as he realized what he was asking for. The Hobbits stared at him for a few seconds, shrugged, and then plodded away into the darkness.
The central problem of writing about South Africa is that it is almost impossible to explain the country's slow-motion catastrophe in terms that make sense to foreigners. Consider these headlines, culled from just a fortnight's newspapers: Failed Billion-Dollar Education Program; Whistle-Blower Murdered, Wife of NIA Chief on Trial for Smuggling Cocaine, the NIA being our CIA.

Blurbs have three parts. You can divide these parts up as paragraphs if you are looking for a simple formula for an effective blurb. Obviously these would short paragraphs just giving a quick taste of what they can expect to read about. Or, you can use the parts in your own way to make a blurb that fits your style and book. Either way, you need these three elements to have an effective blurb.

The fact is that writing is one of those jobs in which you put yourself out there every single day. You have to back yourself in on a regular basis. It's a creative process, so there's a little bit of you in every idea, every article, every assignment, every book. A little piece of you going 'like me, like me'. And if someone doesn't, that little piece of you retires hurt.

Instead, Autism Speaks widely disseminates the information that the prevalence of autism "has increased tenfold in the last decade." That is, 10 years ago, the prevalence of autism was 1 in 1500. If this is accurate, then the total number of autistics in the US would be less than 500,000. How much less would depend on what happened prior to 10 years ago, and how suddenly the leap from 1 in 1500 to 1 in 150 occurred.

"There was a metal fire escape up one side of her house. At the top was a black emergency door with a bar, the kind you find in cinemas. Such doors could be jimmied open. But was it alarmed? I often climbed to the landing outside this door and made a nest, camping on the iron slats. Sometimes her cats passed below and looked up at me. Would they tell? Sometimes she passed below, wheeling her bicycle for nocturnal sorties. Squatting there, refreshing myself with sandwiches and tea from a flask, I would listen to her dwelling as a lover sprawled over her body, detecting her heart."....

Toby was my first dog, and I trained him haphazardly. I didn't know how. I didn't take a class because I didn't know there were classes. (And maybe there weren't, back then. This was a long time ago.) When I ran into a problem--he was terrified of his leash, for instance, or he wouldn't come when I called but instead ran off into the woods--I called the vet. The vet was the only person I could think of who might know what I should do.

This inexpensive vegetable is tasty and easy to cook. Sweet potato shoots (pucuk ubi keledek) normally do not contain harmful agricultural chemicals because they are rather easy to cultivate.

When I was much younger I really wasn’t that interested in gardening. In fact, if I’m truthful, I wasn’t interested at all. That changed when I bought my first unit and the owner before me had created such a lovely outdoor space that I found I could just sit outside and “be” in my garden. During the first autumn in my house, I planted daffodil and iris bulbs and delighted in watching them pop up and then flower in late winter/early spring.
I became embroiled in an argument with all three of them. Finally, the library doors opened and the fake Rasta ran in shouting that he had been racially abused by me and demanding that someone call Dorset Police.

More on Step Two: this does not necessarily mean sending them an ebook every day, just send some helpful hints on the niche, or share a story that they would get something out of that relates to the niche, etc. Once in a while you should send them a free report or free audio interview, etc. but keep in simple. Train them to expect good stuff when opening your emails. This will build great, responsive email lists time and time again.

It was such a fun reading about Lawrence and the many humorous situations in which he finds himself in. First off, so far in my history of reading I don't recall reading a book like this. A book which offers a man's perspective on dating. I never really thought men analyze us women so much.:) Lawrence is comparing dating to battlefield, which is also a comparison I couldn't exactly relate to, but then again, it could be the fact it's been long time since I've dated.
I was a student at Emory & Henry College in the 1980s when a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan was going on in the Bristol, Virginia/Tennessee area. An organizer moved there who was adept at getting press coverage. Only, the reporters found out he had a mixed racial background and belonged to an ethnic group the Klan was against. They had a field day with this news and he was kicked out of his own hate group.

Our encouragement messages go out to believers in many different countries so we try to write for the spiritual edification of all true believers regardless of where they live. We are unaware of other countries that might have official national days of prayer as we have here in America. However I genuinely believe this is a very important day here in the country where God has providentially ordained that I should live out my life on this earth. Wherever you may live you should pray for your country and every point we make today will apply regardless of your location.

She was uncharacteristically cruel when she told me excitedly that "it's about 75 degrees in Paris right now, can you believe it?" I had consoled myself with the thought that although Paris is absolutely fabulous, it would be grey and chilly. A few days ago, I glanced at the temperature when I got up, and it was 38. Gah!
Although some may find it shocking when we dont hold our thoughts and feelings inside, being ourselves draws toward us those people who are of like minds and spirits, and pushes away those people whose ideals we dont share. When we broadcast our true selves, we act as an example for others, showing them how freeing and rewarding it can be. It is not our job to make everyone like us, only to be our best selves to the best of our abilities, without fear. When we harness the bold, outgoing feeling we have today, we can spread light everywhere we go.

Not only do we get the return of the Monk, but we also get the most unlikely returning race- the Vardans! Cornell does a great job of giving the Vardans some background, history and character. We are also treated to a female Chronovore. The climax of the book echoes The Time Monster, with the Chronovore capturing the Monk to be tormented for eternity. Evidently he escaped, as he has recently reappeared in the Big Finish audios.

Perhaps Dewey’s leaders thought that better press could solve the firm’s crisis. But that approach reverses the relationship between public relations and crisis management, which is simple: manage a crisis properly and the resulting story will write itself.

We have to be able to stand up for gamers, especially gamers who don’t have the courage or the ability to stand up for themselves. I love his advice on trying to make sure that you have a dedicated group of players and friends who know you well enough that discrimination won’t be an issue. I love all of my fellow gamers no matter what race, creed, orientation, etc. I’m a fan for all, but what I’m not a fan of is disrespect and grief for just being a fellow gamer. It’s uncalled for and rude behavior that drives me away from online gameplay constantly.
“Suffer me not, O my Lord, to be deprived of the knowledge of Thee in Thy days, and divest me not of the robe of Thy guidance. Give me to drink of the river that is life indeed, whose waters have streamed forth from the Paradise (Ridvan) in which the throne of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, was established, that mine eyes may be opened, and my face be illumined, and my heart be assured, and my soul be enlightened, and my steps be made firm.” (Baha’u'llah, Prayers and Meditations by Baha’u'llah, p. 3)

While reading it one day, my daughter, Kirsten, looked over at it and exclaimed, “Mom, why are you reading it in such a small font? Can you see that!” She showed me her Kindle and I was shocked to see huge font-the kind you can see from over an arm’s length away! I said, “You mean you can enlarge the font?” She laughed. Ever since that day, I was a believer. I have now ordered literally dozens of books from Amazon in every genre except cookbooks and art books. How I love this new and wonderful technology! I will always cherish my home library and still do buy regular bound books but I now prefer to read from my Kindle.
Which is probably why this promotion caught my eye. It seems that, while it is clearly part of a marketing campaign to raise brand awareness and cement revenue streams, this particular ploy appears to have some element of social conscience and respect for culture and tradition.
One thing about the Republican Party Candidates over the years is that they hold their mud slinging to a “bare minimum”….. it is political class …but with these latest allegations against Herman Cain who ONCE held the front running seat of the 2012 Presidential Campaign is no longer obtaining support from even his fellow candidates…….. They ALL have had something to honest and realistic to say about his campagin of course!

Memory cards form the basis of all digital devices that need some sort of resident storage memory on board. For instance, new age digital cameras and mobile phones replace the photo film with cards to store images. You can delete the unwanted images and save the desired ones on to a computer and then write them on a CD. A memory card, in theory can be reused for an infinite number of times. These cards are based on flash memory technology and the best part about using flash memory sticks is that they not only reduce the size of the circuitry enormously, but they are also relatively stronger than contemporary storage devices.
Now, let's say your mom wants to be lavished with a week-long celebration (and you better believe she deserves it). Well, you're in luck, as May 14th-20th is Craft Beer Week!

From there, it is transferred into another room where square moulds are spread out on long tables. An employee scoops the liquid into these and levels it off with a tool similar to a giant spatula. After about half hour, the moulds have set and the final product is boxed up in a second room – 32 to a box. I helped box some up the other day just to see what it was like.

I believe it was early in my sophomore year when I attempted to kill myself. I had an old Aspirin bottle tucked beneath my mattress, stocked with pills of all kinds—prescriptions and otherwise—that I had pilfered from medicine cabinets all across town. On one particular starry night, I climbed out on my roof and looked out at the sky, thinking long and hard about my life, thinking long and hard about my death. I decided that death would be more fitting.

This theme of what constitutes Proper Bonds is pretty overtly developed throughout the play, so I won't belabor it any further. Instead I will note that Cymbeline is now classified as a Romance whereas Lear is, obviously, a tragedy. Of course Shakespeare himself did not so classify it and Cymbeline was, in the First Folio of 1623, itself classified as a tragedy. It's not ... unless you have a really broad definition of "tragedy"; the play's a little too dark to be considered a comedy, though. (One of the characters is decapitated and both his bodiless head and headless body are brought on stage — kinda hard to laugh off; but the guy, Cloten, was a real dick so it's really not that disturbing.) Cymbeline is a prime example of why latter-day scholars came up with this fourth Shakespearean play-type, "Romance" (the First Folio acknowledges only "Comedies, Histories & Tragedies").
I called my Boss and told him the situation. That because I couldn’t park near work that I would have to quit as I wasn’t going to risk this pregnancy.

That the EDL now seems to be going through a metamorphise from a protest group into a political group, at the same time as it seeking to expand, is no coincidence.
Arguably being one of the most important elements of a story, dialogue is also one of the most difficult things to deal with. It’s hard to know when a character should speak and what he or she should say. It gets even harder when a second character with an entirely different personality is required to respond to the first character. For some, dialogue is by far the most harrowing of all storytelling necessities and so the temptation is to avoid it altogether, giving the reader nothing to hold onto but ongoing exposition.
A. Robles. — In a country where everybody fishes feverishly in the sea of political correctness, one has to bow to the consistency of a leader who motivates thousands of Catalans without much to fish in a short term in the tempestuous waters of Catalan politics . He is followed because of his loyalty to stated principles, a history and a cultural and ethnic heritage. Josep Anglada (Vic, 1959), president of Platform for Catalonia (PXC) has been in recent years the target of all insults, all the blaming, and all the outcries. His example of Catalanism, of loyalty to and love for Spain, all fitting his ideals, would deserve all honors in any society not as weak and defenseless as our own.
For years, Special K has focused their ads on making ordinary, healthy women believe that if they're not frighteningly skinny, then the only answer is to spend all day eating Special K products. Breakfast, lunch and snacks are to be SK cereals, shakes or snack bars. It's an excellent marketing strategy, but a poor health strategy. The third ingredient in Special K's original cereal is sugar. The fifth and six are salt and high fructose corn syrup (which is also sugar). I couldn't even bear to check the other variations, like Chocolate Delight. The Milk Chocolate Protein Shake contains sugar (third ingredient), as well as four other forms of sugar AND "nutritive sweeteners and non-nutritive sweeteners". The shake also contains soy protein isolate, which was approved in the late 70's as a binder and sealer for cardboard boxes, but has never been approved for human consumption. Somehow, through the magic of FDA loopholes, SPI has made its way into our food supply anyway. Special K is far from the only place you'll find it.

The point? Since the turn of the century WW has been, in one way or another, at the very center of the DCU, featured in its most central storylines in both the comics and on television, and portrayed by the best writers and artists (among them George Perez, John Byrne, Bruce Timm, Ed Benes, Jim Lee, Frank Quitely, Brian Stelfreeze, J.

The year is 2012. The wheels of commerce, globalisation and technology have opened the world up for us. Compared to the 1920’s where our grandparents lived in small communities made up of people from the same race and religion, the world we now know is very different. Through all these open channels, we have become part of one big community, and it seems as if non-conformity is the key. When we look around now, it has almost become the norm to see couples from different backgrounds and children of mixed parentage.

Because: the craft of the filmmaking was top-notch (check out the credits for editing, music, cinematography) and it was duly matched by a quartet of fine performances; Knightley was career-best so far; Mendes a minor revelation. It was misjudged time and again for, as far as I could tell, merely featuring the lives of wine-drinking Manhattanites. Well, gosh! Away with you every Woody Allen and Whit Stillman movie! It's a film I feel deserves reassessment.

Islam isn't an obsession, it is worship. They worship their God and constantly give thanks. The Five Pillers of Islam is a list of behaviors, behaviors that lead to the idea of worship. If men do this and women do this, if they pray five times a day, go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, if they give alms, if they stay from certain drinks and foods, then through that they will worship their God.

Garrett Oliver has assured us that nobody is making any money off the Oxford Companion to Beer. In view of this I do ask myself exactly why old-guard beer writers are so eager to defame those who have raised criticisms of the book. Roger writes, rather immoderately: “In spite of this, the bloggerati have come piling in, damning the book and some saying it should be withdrawn. How they must wish they had been around in the 1930s when book-burning was in vogue.”
It doesn’t take a hero or a martyr to answer God’s call to religious life. If someone thinks they are not bright enough, not holy enough, not wise enough, not good enough, then welcome to the club. A heart knows when the light goes on and God beckons you forward. My advice is to let it shine.

Death is the concept with which we'll never be able to reconcile ourselves. It's a fundamental part of our life, but we make light of it, or ignore it. Sometimes we write about it as if to exorcise the demons that embody its omnipresent nature. A few weeks ago I attended the funeral of a close relative of my wife's. He'd been suffering from a long-term illness and I guess that we all, including his wife, expected his demise at some point soon. Just writing those words makes me want to go back and wipe them out. That's what death does to you; it leads you to a point of denial and self-denial. And yet, how can we deny its starring role in our lives?

On my last night there, I was writing (as Victoria Lamb) a scene where Shakespeare, as a young theatrical, returns to his home town of Stratford, not far from Coventry, to see his wife Anne. Although sitting in a modern city centre hotel, it was surprisingly easy to imagine myself back in sixteenth century Warwickshire, for Coventry is a medieval city itself and steeped in history. Indeed, it's a city that Shakespeare would probably have known well; he may even have visited its magnificent medieval cathedral once or twice, now a burnt-out shell courtesy of bombing raids across the industrial Midlands during World War II.

Once we're sure the book is on the normal decline, we up the price to its sustained price. But how can we tell whether the new price or the natural decline is affecting sales more negatively? Well, we can't. But we can compare the next 24-hour period to the one that just passed. If revenue is greater in the next period than it was in the last, we're at least keeping royalties from decaying.

Ed Powers has endorsed the formation of the current Cammann Road District, which under its current structure unfairly creates revenue from property values in the district. This structure charges many residents who use a small portion of the public road more than some who use nearly the entire road. Some residents of the district have also been excluded from payment to the district because they are located in the city limits or the Coquille Tribal lands, although they have access through the district. Endorsement of these unfair practices and others have resulted in a petition to recall.

For the title stamp I used Tim Holtz stamps and made my own multi-colored stamp pad. The metal in the corners is an iRock embellishment. I embossed the cowboy with Walnut Stain Distress Embossing Powder and inked it with distress inks. The rope thing was made by making a mold with old jewelry parts and a button using Mold n Pour. Then I melted Utee and Distress Embossing powder and poured the embellishment. FUN!! The key is grungeboard cut from a Tim Holtz die and inked with Vintage Photo Distress Stain.

I’m fascinated by Vin’s interactions with Elend particularly because we haven’t seen much of the nobility yet, but he’s already set himself apart as being a bit different from all the rest. It leads to some ethical questions about Kelsier’s plan because the nobility aren’t being presented as pure evil. Vin seemed to have liked him, and if she gets any sort of romantic ideas then it might jeopardize her role in the plan. Right now she doesn’t know the nobility at all, but if she starts getting attached to anyone then she might have second thoughts about what she’s planning on doing.
Piña coladas are not my favorite drink in the world, but they do hold a special place in my heart. Not only are they a featured in the refrain of one my favorite karaoke songs (thanks Jimmy Buffet), but they remind me of a magical summer in Budapest. That’s where piña colada obsession began. At Morrison’s 1 to be exact. (If you are ever in Budapest, you have to go to Morrison’s (the one by the opera, not the other one)). It took us a while to discover the piña colada at Morrison’s. We tried and failed with our regular go tos, but an impulsive decision lead to a wonderful discovery.
I am hopeful that Irene will downgrade before she hits land, lose steam and speed, but I think I'm being overly optimistic about that. My greatest concern is for the flooding issues and the high winds. I am preparing for the possibility that more trees in my yard will be knocked down and that my basement will flood, deep flooding. There is a dangerously old sassafras tree right next to my house. The last hurricane that blew through our area broke off the highest branches and tossed them down the street, fortunately (amazingly!) missing all the homes in their path. This old tree is half dead and one I wanted to have removed earlier this spring when I had others done. The funds I had set aside for the tree work had to be used for other things, so the sassy still looms over the house, like Snoopy doing his vulture imitation.

She shyly said that when it comes to her ideal man, there are always different men in mind, but this time it was G-Dragon. After giving her answer, she shyly smiled. When she explained why she chose G-Dragon, she simply answered it’s “G-Dragon”. She was touched by his move when they were in their company’s ski trips last year. Same explanation was said by G-Dragon on a different interview.

Worn together or alone, all duo eye-shadow can be applied sheer or built up for a more dramatic effect. Why should you use N.A.R.S.? Simple, it applies smoothly, blends easily, crease resistant, awesome color, and mostly is long-lasting.

Cassimara is the archer of our team, with an unusual combination of classes (ranger/rogue/inquisitor, I think). She hunts for undead with our team. What makes her unusual is that she's a dhampir, i.e. her dad was a vampire. Our team cleric is an "expert" undead killer who didn't notice this until she revealed it to us like three sessions into the game. It makes for an unusual team member since our cleric is pretty prone to accidentally hurting her with her energy channels, and always has to give her a heads up before he starts blasting things.

Edgar Reitz, son of a watchmaker, was born in 1932. He grew up in Hunsrück and, after finishing school, left for Munich, where he studied German literature, journalism and drama. He has been involved with literary works, avant-garde music, literature, the fine arts and film since the mid-1950s. He made his first films in 1958, was a member of the Oberhausener Group who founded Young German Film in 1962 and declared Papa’s Cinema dead. Together with other young directors he founded the Film Institute at the Design College in Ulm the following year. For 8 years Reitz taught stage direction and camera theory at this the first film school in the Federal Republic of Germany. His first feature film Mahlzieten appeared during this time and was honored as best debut film at the Venice International Film Festival in 1966. Numerous feature films, documentaries and experimental films followed, which received international acclaim and several awards, including prizes for Die Reise Nach Wien (The Journey to Vienna) and Stunde Null (Hour Zero). In 1971 Reitz founded a production company in Munich, which has since produced both its own projects as well as films by other directors. Since the mid-1970’s Reitz has published a number of books on film theory and film aesthetics, as well as narratives, essays, poetry and the literary versions of his films. 1995 saw the founding of the European Film Institute EIKK in Karlsruhe with Reitz as Professor for Film at the National Design College in Karlsruhe.

Mail theft is one of the most common crimes being committed at present. Mail thieves can easily get into your personal data and steal your identity without you even knowing it. Your credit cards and other vital information can be at danger. All your important files that are sent via mail might be stolen from you and be used against you in different means. Ultimately, your reputation can be damaged – one thing that is quite difficult to bring back. This is why getting a secured mail is necessary.
Petitioner’s second ground for relief in his Sec. 2254 petition is that he was placed in double jeopardy by being punished both for felony murder and the underlying felony. The district court agreed that there was a double jeopardy violation, but held that since Petitioner had not raised the issue in his direct appeal or in his first post-conviction proceeding in the Oklahoma courts, he had procedurally defaulted the double jeopardy claim under Oklahoma law and was barred from raising the matter in a federal habeas corpus petition. The federal district court further held that Petitioner did not come within any exception to the procedural default rule and on this basis declined to consider the double jeopardy issue on its merits.

There’s no question that many of us who work at the Red Cross bring our work home with us – you never do know when a disaster will happen. But, since joining Pinterest a few weeks ago, I’ve realized that many people literally bring the Red Cross home – by way of pillows, shower curtains, posters, art and quilts.

On the other side of the matter, there's Jupiter's moon Europa. At a distance 5.2 times greater than the Earth to the Sun, we'd expect this to be a very, very cold place - and at it's surface it most certainly is, with an equilibrium temperature of -170 degrees Celsius. At this location, we'd never expect Europa to be inside the habitable zone. Drill through its approximately 100-km thick ice shell, however, and you'll find an ocean so deep that it contains more liquid water than all the oceans on Earth. Again, the neglected heating term here is the internal energy of Europa generated from the massive tidal forces the moon feels from Jupiter's gravity. The case of Europa has opened astrobiologists to the possibility that Earth-like planets may not be the only place to look for E.T., but moons of large gas giant exoplanets. as well. The field of "exomoons" is fertile ground which has only just recently been opened up.
When I look up the most common misspelling of my name, Reginald Shepard, which people sometimes insist upon even when they’re publishing or paying me, no matter how many times I sign and print the correct spelling of my name, besides finding various references to my misspelled self (I try to correct them when I can), I also find references to a death row inmate in Florida by that name. I don’t know what his crime was, but I imagine that it was probably murder. I find it a little disturbing to once again have a criminal doppelganger living (though who knows for how long) in the same state. At least there are two crucial letters separating my name from his, his fate from mine. But still…

While all sides agree that subsidies had to be reduced, as the costs of solar panels continue to drop, the argument was about the speed and scale of the cut, with a 50% reduction in the subsidy viewed as going too far and too fast. The government however has defended the measure saying that the scheme they inherited had become too expensive and that it was energy consumers who would have ultimately suffered.
It is hard to think that Dad, who is such a big part of my wedding day may be still ill. That there are no guarantees that he won’t be hospital. Things are not always easy to plan when you have a sick family member and that can become hard. I just hope that when it is me the people close to me won’t resent me for it.
I spent the afternoon catching up with an old acting colleague whom I studied with back home. It was great to see how he’s going (he’s now steered away from the acting world and into the business/entrepreneurial one). He’s hopefully going to visit again soon and see my show in September!

But, when I sat down to write WEAVING MAGIC, I didn’t want the story to be a bad boy/good girl story. So, I spun a little twist. By all appearances, main character, Christopher is the “bad boy” trying to stay sober while Shantel is the good girl. However, as the story progresses, you realize that appearances are deceiving and Shantel is the one who has some big problems while Christopher really is trying to do the right thing.
When will people wake up and realise that we should leave the idealistic wanna-be-politicians to strive for their dreams so we can get on with the task of taking care of ourselves, of becoming proactive, of facing the reality of where we are living, that we are living in a dangerous black African State, not in a civilised western white country.

If we say that we have love, or do love, or are love, and we don’t complete the actions that love deems necessary because our will is dissolute, then we are rendering love false. False love has no way to perfectly inform will, and so will is damaged from its inception, and we begin to see how the cycle perpetuates itself…

While working on the classes for my endorsement (a completely different world than secondary ed), I realized I quite liked what I was doing. The professors were certain that I would get hired to teach an upper grade because of my bachelor's degree. I felt very blessed to finish right when Iron County was opening two new schools, but even after interviewing several times I didn't get any offers. I had been approached about doing an internship while student teaching, so I was pretty certain I would get a job at one of the schools. I was crushed.
These are the thoughts running through my head lately since the knitting and spinning bug is keeping me looking forward to new fiber projects.

I don't have all the details yet, but they're going to try to do most of the filming in sessions of a few days each, spaced apart by a several weeks so she won't have to miss too much school, and she'll have time to catch up in between. They're also paying for our travel expenses and will put us up in a hotel during the filming sessions. Which is good, because...wow, have you ever looked at the cost of hotels in New York City?

I believe the answer to be ‘yes’. For example, The Wall Street Journal charges users anything between £25 and £42 a year and still has about 600,000 paid subscribers. The majority of newspapers in theUK, including The Daily Telegraph, Financial Times, The Independent and The Times are charging their readers in one way or the other. While some may argue that the internet is all about being free, the fact is that while newspapers are dying, news or good journalism is not. And when you are producing exclusive content for your websites and investing in resources to produce that content, why not charge for it?

Construction: Carpentry – This community of carpentry practitioners were predominately Africans born in the Caribbean with five of the eight of Mixed-race ancestry. The apprentice was only 11 years old and the oldest member was 55 years old. The mean age was 25.875 years, mode was 18 years and the medium was 20 years, showing a predominately young community of workers. Two members of the community had another African in their ‘service’. Perhaps these five mixed race men demonstrate the middle section of what Schwab (1989: 28) referred to as a ‘three tiered society’, of Africans, mixed-race, and whites, structured not only in term of colour but also psychologically.

Afterward, I was tired. My "treadmill accident area" (use your imagination) was sending painful twinges down my right leg. Everyone was busy toasting and digging into the cheesecakes on their tables, so I took a deep breath and some more Tylenol and packed up the harp myself, hauled it out of the ballroom, down the hall, into the elevator, down into the parking garage, out the tiny door to my wonderful new truck. Loaded the harp, the bench, the music stand, my music bag. All in very cute shoes. Felt a great sense of accomplishment. Started fantasizing about the ice cream waiting for me at home. Turned around to back the truck out of the parking stall, felt a twinge in my "accident area" and then....

As a child, a was a voracious reader. During my long summer vacations, I stayed at the library. I always took out the maximum amount of books (8) and usually returned them all within a week. One summer I declared I was going to read every single book in the Babysitter’s Club Series and I did. I even read the Super Specials, mysteries and a few of the Little Sister’s spinoffs (totally not as wonderful). I was devastated when Claudia’s grandmother died.

Beethoven made numerous acquaintances at Vienna. Everybody in the musical and aristocratic world admired the young composer. These music-lovers were Beethoven’s greatest supporters. He became angry regularly with one or another of them, often making honorable amends soon afterwards. His talent excused his excessive, impulsive behavior.
While we are on the topic of color, my mood was thrown right back into cranky when I popped into the new studio on my way home later in the afternoon. The painter spray painted the entire window wall BLACK! Black... I mean like black, black. Ceiling black. My studio was suddenly cave like with every bit of sun being sucked into the oblivion of the wall and ceiling. The building manager said they can't put it back to white. I'll have to do it on my own. Sigh, I have SO much other work to do (my latest Color Canvas piece is due next week!). I did not need painting a wall up to a 15ft ceiling on my list. Argh.

“I have your dog. Follow me,” she said, then immediately walked away.
I went into the office, and we sat down to talk. She told me that I looked different. That she could see it on my face. That I was happy. That something had changed a bit. Because of this, she felt I didn’t have to talk about anything if I didn’t want to. We didn’t have to work on anything if I’d rather pocket the money and come back in a few weeks. However, I didn’t want to leave it at that. I didn’t want to pat myself on the shoulder and consider it done. I wanted to push through.

Today I had lunch with a bluebird-experienced friend who told me that it was o.k. to look in the nest--she had in fact once removed a nestful of parasite-ridden hatchlings, sprayed them with pyrethium, and returned them safely to their parents, who didn't seem to mind. So the minute I got home I stood on a garden chair and peered into the box. There, glowing in the dark, were three glossy eggs, the same bright blue as their papa's wings.
Sure, the brief appearance of Jennifer Balgobin (Dr. Caligari) and Steve Buscemi (Ghost World) at a New York raceway, the even briefer turn by Max Perlich (Homicide: Life on the Street) as a busboy, and the sultry work of the gorgeous Elizabeth Peña (Lone Star) as a femme fatal in uncomplicated lingerie might have sustained the film from falling completely off track for a little while. But come on, who are we kidding here? The film is only barely on the cusp of being bearable because of what Cyndi and Jeff brought to the psychic table.
So how does one become consistent at their actions, values, principles, expectations and outcomes? How can you make things such as values and principles tangible enough to be measured? If I say that I am an honest person then surely I must be truthful about everything in my life? As we all know, there are times in your life where telling the honest truth can get you a slap or punch in the face! Everyone has their own ‘moral compass’. Created usually from your up-bringing, parents, family and friends. Some people, and I’ve met plenty, don’t even have a compass. And could actually care less about values and principles. Growing up I had always used the Bibles values and principles to help guide me between right and wrong. I also had a ‘Disney’ up-bringing too. Evil wizards and witches, knights in shining armor and all that. I would like to think that I had/have a very solid moral compass. That, obviously, sometimes didn’t work very well!
Kids off to school
Is there any possible justification for throwing good money after bad with another bailout. Well, if you’re a politician from Germany or France and your big banks (i.e., some of your major campaign contributors) foolishly bought lots of government bonds from Greece, the answer might be yes. After all, screwing taxpayers to benefit insiders is a longstanding tradition in Europe.

Dogs like me and they don´t bark at me; I love dogs and I think they can tell.

Head first for the opulent green-and-gold China Room, outfitted throughout with fine china and art. The Library Room lies beyond, centered around the golden apple tree of the Firebird fable, a focal point for dining in comfortable elegance.

Once I got my little bag of goodies home, I remembered an episode of Barefoot Contessa where she talked about soaking mussels with flour and water to disgorge any sand. Ina's never steered me wrong, so I soaked the mussels in 2 quarts of water with 1/3 cup of flour for 30 minutes and then cleaned them all up.

When the pastry dough is chilled and the mangoes are mascerated, get out two clean bowls. Use one to drain the mango syrup into (through a fine mesh sieve if you've got a big one, or through a pasta strainer or even a slotted spoon in a pinch) and the second to hold the drained mango pieces. Butter and flour an ~9-inch tart or pie pan (with a removable bottom, preferably), and roll the dough out to ~4 inches in diameter larger than your pan. (I always get lazy when I'm rolling dough out, but you want to roll it enough so it'll come up over the sides of the pan by at least an inch.) Drape the dough into the pan, gently tucking it down into the corners of the pan and letting the edges hang over the sides. Get your oven heating to 400 F.
The arrogant, headstrong older brother is running the party’s youth arm — yes, think of Jubo Dal / League. The soft spoken, dreamy eyed younger brother is studying overseas.

There was a bit of apprehension from my dear wife when I suggested it for our meal as she claimed she had never had a goulash that was flavoursome enough. I dug my heels in and set out to prove otherwise.

Look at your own actions. Right now, I’m speaking especially to those of you reading this who are not black. When you see a black man in a hoodie, I’m sure you don’t try to shoot him. But if it’s late, and you’re alone, do you try to avoid walking too close to him? You probably don’t spew racist slurs all of the time. But have you ever made a generalization, even just mentally, about black people that you knew wasn’t quite fair?

PLUSES - Good photography, particularly for the era. The 3-D effect of the photos is cool when the player overlays the team name, such as above.

Every time I participate in one of these events I am reminded of what is important to me and why I live the way I do. I laughed my ass off several times. I had deep conversations with people whose opinion mattered to me. I did not give a f*** about who may judge me as a parent. I realized that this is how I feel most of the time. I have managed to create relationships in my life in which I am able to connect with people who challenge me to stretch as a person without ever feeling like I can't measure up.

Getting back to the question regarding whether or not Kundalini activations can be dangerous… Well, I believe there can be a danger if the body is not physically healthy and pliable, because the amount of energy going through it is quite high. It would be like having a body that is fit for 100 watts, but 1000 watts of power is trying to surge through. I also believe it important to have emotional baggage cleared out, because stagnant or stuck energy in the body can be quite painful when the energy surge finds any type of blockage.

I would like to make one more limitation as to the name “brethren”. Of course, they were fellow Jews, of the stock of Abraham. Looking back to Genesis 21:12 we see that the seed of Abraham was limited to Isaac, not including the offspring of Ishmael “And God said unto Abraham, let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.”

She was staring directly at my erect cock as she masturbated. I was so turned on by her looking at me I had to grasp my cock and seek relief from the arousal that threatened to split my penis open in its erection. I wrapped my hand around my swollen cockhead and began to jerk and tug it. She intently watched me as she did herself. In a few minutes she shuddered demurely as I watched her face contort in her orgasm. It was such a turn on to see her cum; the electric jolt of my own orgasm would not be denied anymore. A few moments later as she watched me transfixed in the final throes of her own crisis, I hurled a long thick string of cum onto her breasts, which was followed by a few more spurts that landed on her belly. She ran her fingers though the still warm cum on her nipple and tested it between her thumb and forefinger and then spread it on her nipple. She pulled my head to her nipple and asked me to suck it off which I did dutifully. This was the first time I ever licked my own warm cum off of a woman’s nipple, something that I still relish doing today with my wife.
This week’s word is: HOME.
This week I am going to mix things up a bit. I am finding menu planning to be a bit too stressful and I tend to waste too much when I plan a week in advance. Yesterday I cleaned out the refridgorator and made a couple dishes to have for this week. Once everything is eaten up then I will sit down and plan a couple more dishes to make. This seems to work best for us. I have things in the freezer and pantry for breakfast and lunches. This is so much easier for me right now. My brain just can't think too far ahead.LOL

“Lejeune Court”, like most of the streets in Old Greenwich’s Havemeyer Park, has a World War Two-connected name. Some of the other streets are named after the distinguished generals and admirals who won the war for us, guys like Nimitz, MacArthur, Halsey, Marshall, and Arnold. I like that.

This verse is a warning to all people, but it is especially a warning to the Jewish people, who are supposed to be the “builders” of God’s community of faith on Earth. But they have built their own house according to their own plans, and they have not included God’s appointed cornerstone.
Now the Lord had said to Ahijah, “Here is the wife of Jeroboam, coming to ask you something about her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.”

The other good intention that I was unable to follow through with yesterday was giving blood. I turned up to my appointment, but I had been put down for a later time, and as a result I would have been late picking my son up from school. Never mind! Another date is booked.
A tender subject, though one very important to cover. Sex is an extremely powerful Magick, sacred in every tradition. Virginity is considered a Holy status by almost every spiritualist point-of-view.
The event includes being greeted in the hall by your child holding a rose, led into a candle-lit room, seeing the children dressed in their Sunday best and reverently singing and praying, watching them sweetly doing sign language to "Mary Did You Know," being treated to tea and cookies, handmade gifts and the grand finale - a slideshow of the kids' whole year...wow.

In many cases, large doses of water-soluble vitamins can be taken with no ill effects since excessive amounts are readily excreted. However, liver inflammation may occur when niacin is taken at daily doses of over 500 mg. This problem occurs more often at doses six times as high.

The weekend started off perfectly with a sexy invitation for a get-a-way in a semi remote, yet very public past-Olympic location. I drove for my secret rendezvous after work on Friday and made it in time to get him out of the hotel room and into the locker room for the second game of his tournament. Then watched with pride from the bleachers at the man I would be spending the night with as he did his thing.

I'm sure you've guessed it, our blood test this past Friday was negative. To make matters worse, the night before Thanksgiving the Dr called to tell us the other 5 embryos did not make it. The cells have to continue to divide and mature before they can be frozen for future use; they just stopped. I was devastated. I think I knew that night that this is what would happen. If the cells can't properly divide in a perfect, scientific environment, do you really think they'd progress in my body that I do not treat as a temple? The few family members I talked to about this were all shocked too. Our daily Dr updates regarding the embryos were going so well. At one point, he even said our embryos were "perfect." That's one hell of a statement to make one day then the next they all die. Nature can be cruel.

After Rogers’ death, Payne started drinking heavily. On October 7, 1841, Payne, after making the rounds of several New York bars, purchased the poison laudanum. He took the ferry to Hoboken and went to Nick Moore’s House, where he got properly drunk. Soused, he staggered, holding a bottle of brandy, to the spot in the woods where Rogers’ clothes had been found. He wrote on a piece of paper, “To the world here I am on the very spot. May God forgive me for my misspent life.” He put the note in his pocket, drank the laudanum and washed it down with the brandy. Then he laid down and died.

So, this week, we got the actual finale, “Slaughterhouse” which, by the way, is an awesome episode titl). I want to come back to the chess game metaphor I’ve been using on and off for this show. If the season is a chess game, last week represented the series of moves to catch the queen. Which is all well and good because the queen, being quite powerful, represents a giant chunk of the game. However, there’s still the task of taking the king. No checkmate until the king is out of commission. And that can be a task unto itself.
Reader David sent a photo of his daughter’s cat, named “Latke” (latkes are potato pancakes: the apotheosis of Jewish cuisine). Re this name, David said, ” When I was married, we got the cat near Passover. My ex-celebrated the holiday, I never really did.” He adds:
There once was a King who offered a prize to the artist who would paint the best picture of peace. Many artists tried. The King looked at all the pictures, but there were only two he really liked and he had to choose between them.

In the very rare instance I bow off my rationally-superior high horse and actually succumb to the realization that I may need outside counsel to handle my emotions, I crave specific action items. Then I’ll want to discuss the possible scenarios that may arise from each course of action. Remember, I calculate everything. And I mean everything. Telling me “follow your heart” or “there’s always a light at the end of the tunnel” will most likely result in you getting kicked in the shins.

How many times have you or I operated in the workplace based only on our skill and ability, without seeking to know the details of God’s will in the matter? David could have simply assumed that since he had won the last battle, surely God would give him victory the same way. No. David had learned that communicating with the living God is the only sure way of victory. His skill was not enough. He had to have God’s blessing.

Christie frequently used familiar settings for her stories. Christie’s travels with Mallowan contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East. Other novels (such as And Then There Were None) were set in and around Torquay, where she was born. Christie’s 1934 novel Murder on the Orient Express was written in the Hotel Pera Palace in Istanbul, Turkey, the southern terminus of the railway. The hotel maintains Christie’s room as a memorial to the author.[17] The Greenway Estate in Devon, acquired by the couple as a summer residence in 1938, is now in the care of the National Trust.

Björk is the sort of person it is pretty much impossible to be neutral about. Whether you love or loathe her music, you simply cannot fail to be fascinated by the woman who creates it.

So Annie posted those G-Darn typewriters! And it made me think of my Mom and HER dream.....to publish a book. Well, in a sense, she did, she wrote a book for our family called "America at Last," documenting experience along with her Parents and siblings of coming to America in 1929. I have a "bound" version, as well as several of my relatives.... Not to mention her published submissions to the local paper about my brother Ross, serving in Viet Nam...A glimpse if you will of what life was like for our soldier's (my heroic brother) back in 1967...

If you decide to go with a cream liner, you will need a brush to apply it. I suggest using the Merle Norman Lasting Cream Eyeliner in Black (for darker skin tones), or Coffee (for lighter skin tones), MAC Fluid Line in Blacktrack, and the Revlon color stay cream liner in Black or Brown. Merle Norman, and MAC make wonderful eye-liner brushes.

MARISOL: Up or down?
Because the medical community and men want their women to be fertile, many serious illnesses in the reproductive organs are not treated as aggressively as they should be. Cervical and Ovarian and even fibroid tumors, 1% of which do become cancer are left in the body and a woman is told-"we will keep an eye on it". Women who need hysterectomies under the age of 40 are often denied the surgery as the doctor tells us we may still have children even when we are on birth control and tell the doctor we never want children.

In addition, there are other factors not acknowledged by western medicine that influence our ability to stay well or get ill.

Now. On the US site, which goes at normal speed, it gives me a link saying "See all recordings available (185)" and I can see 20 works listed on my screen. In the EU I don't get that link, and I can see 12 works because for some reason they've put plenty of blank space between items in the list. And in the US it tells me how many recordings there are of each work, and in the EU it doesn't. All right, click on something: in the US I get another "See all recordings" and a list of Performers and a list of Labels, while in the EU I get a list of recordings in release-date order (newest first) plus a link for a pop-up of Performers or Labels (or irrelevant Conductors or Ensembles).

Yesterday was spent shopping, getting haircuts, doing interview prep for my upcoming work week, and cleaning. Today after mass I made up a glaze for the ham with brown sugar, apple cider, dry mustard, ground Valencia orange peel, and ground cloves. Cathy made scalloped potatoes and roasted cauliflower, and family came for lunch. The ham was magnificent. The Rieker's ham cost about twice as much as the plastic-wrapped, perfectly edible hams from the supermarket, and it was fully worth it. Wow, what a good ham. I can't remember the last time I saw my dad eat so much meat. I'm really looking forward to ham sandwiches. I had my last bottle of Tröegs Scratch #6 (the 'Dortmunder'), a Reading with my mom, and a Sea Hag IPA. Now I'm getting ready to have...something. Not sure what.

The CNRDR is claiming it took power because of the incompetence of President Touré, and that it will hand over power to a democratically elected regime. It’s true that President Touré has never been more unpopular in Bamako than this year, and there will be some who will celebrate his apparent ouster. (Touré’s defense minister was on BBC radio this morning saying that the president is “in a safe place” — i.e., the coup leaders haven’t caught him yet.) But it remains to be seen how this coup will be received: even if many Malians don’t like the incumbent president, they see a military putsch as a huge step backward for the country. These sorts of things aren’t supposed to happen nowadays! And of course the reaction from abroad has been uniformly against the coup.

A week after sorting the chain tension out an unpleasant grinding noise manifested itself whenever I coasted; the freewheel had failed. I decided that dark, rainy October mornings and evenings weren’t the time to flip the flip-flop hub and relearn how to ride fixed wheel as I hadn’t done it since I was 5, so I ordered up a new freewheel and removal tool and dug the MTB out of the shed for temporary commuting duties. The new ACS freewheel was £25, the same price as some lower end cassettes and a whole £15 more than the failed Lida unit.

Method: Put the washed fish pieces in a vessel covering completely with water. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder to it and boil over moderate heat till tender. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool. Peel off the thick skins and remove the bones and thorns of the fishes. Mash the flesh of fishes into tiny flakes. Mix well the chilly powder, coriander powder, black pepper powder, 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric powder, and 1 teaspoon salt into the mashed fish flakes. Heat a frying pan and pour in the oil and ghee into it. When smoking hot, add the onions, garlic, and green chillies all together. Saute well till the onions turn limp. Add the mashed fish flakes and saute over moderate heat for approximately 5 minutes turning over very frequently and over low heat for 5 minutes or till an attractive aroma is given out. It is so delicious eaten either hot or cold as a side dish with rice, chappathis, or bread. Enjoy!
During visits to Colombia, Brazil and Chile this past week, Pentagon chief Leon Panetta underscored their importance as military partners in the Pacific, where China is challenging U.S. influence in a number of countries.

“Of course. I have a backup plan for everything.

Over several decades, however, the nation that the magazine was set up to review changed so spectacularly that there is no longer any certainty that it is an actual nation with a unified culture and identity. The most obvious of the many divisions that have arisen is that Blacks are no longer held to the same standards as the rest of the country, with the result that a great many of them have simply given up trying to live in a way compatible with Whites. While some see this as a disaster for the “Black family,” it can also be seen as the rejection of what are essentially Northern European modes of behaviour, and the reassertion of the tribal and extended family patterns inherent in African populations.

I would recommend Portland and the Northwest to any craft beer drinker. I think that they truly embrace the craft beer culture and it is rivaled by no other place at this time. We have been to Asheville, NC (the other beer-centric city) many times, but I have never experienced the full on culture and embrace of craft brewing like in Portland (it is definitely there in Asheville, I just think it is on a way smaller scale). It really is embedded into Portland and is part of what makes that city great.

I use the Logos Bible App daily. It is the best app for reading books, although the books must be purchased through the Logos or Vyrso store. There is no import function for Kindle books or other e-reader formats at this time. While this seems like a negative, the Logos Library is rich in material for biblical studies. If a book is available in Logos and Kindle, I will always choose Logos version. This is primarily because Logos books have real page numbers (not “locations”) and the footnotes appear at the bottom of the page you are currently reading. Logos has an excellent note-taking system with a wide variety of highlighting features. Notes I make on my iPad are automatically saved online, and they are immediately available on my desktop version of Logos. I have several notes files for various topics (Gospel of John, for example), and as I read I add highlights and annotations. I can cut and paste these notes into my word processor when I am reading to write.

So, it's a Friday, and I thought, why not pair up two caffeine packed, much favored beverages and create an essay around them, an ode possibly? Anyone up for some coffee or tea?

I'm in a feminist fury about Michelle (I'll use her first name to avoid confusion with her husband) feeling forced to quit, but make no mistake: I'm not blaming her. Few could stand up to the pressure she's facing, especially from blacks, to sacrifice herself on the altar of her husband's ambition. He could be the first black president, you know! Also, she must be beside herself trying to hold things together for her daughters. I'm blaming the world and every man, woman, child and border collie in it who helps send the message that women's lives must be subordinate to everyone else's.
After that, pork belly is quite simple. Like other large cuts of meat, you simply go low and slow. In this case, I braised the pork belly for six hours at 200 degrees, and then set it on a rack to roast for two more hours at 250. Finally, I turned the broiler on, and set it under there for 20 minutes to crisp up the skin. I watched it pretty closely, and used foil to cover the areas that were getting dark fast. The result: tender meat, little residual fat and wonderful crisp skin.

This experience, the evolutionary unfolding of the human organism, is well documented in the lives of thousands and thousands of saints throughout the world and throughout history, and although often-(but not always) preceded by multiple meditative and mystic experiences, is not gradual but rather always described as a sudden and illuminating realisation of reality, a heightened state of consciousness that directly perceives the reality of consciousness, both internal and that known as the external universe, suddenly and profoundly, beyond words imagination and concept.

Because I didn't mention something in one post, does not mean that I've never thought of it/about it before. I love hearing from readers and getting a variety of opinions! But I do feel slightly insulted when people post comments telling me I must have NEVER EVER thought of socioeconomic factors, or that I must have never thought of the fact some families are single-parent. Really? I always feel bad when I get comments like that. So please do bring up aspects that you feel might have been overlooked in a post, I just ask that if it's something very obvious, like the fact that many people have a low income, you assume the best: that I have considered it myself, so don't approach it in a way that suggests I must have never thought of it!

Set in the early 1970s, it creates a great sense of place and time and quickly conveys the relationships between mother / daughter and schoolgirl / suitor. Our heroine finds herself in a perilous situation of her own making, and her solution is as brutal as it is inevitable. I believe that the best fairy tales carry a warning on their gossamer wings; for me, Black Shoes issues its warning cry loudest of all in this anthology.
I added an extra tbsp of the mix to my cup because I found it to be a little watery. I also added a piece of chocolate to give it an extra chocolaty flavor. If you'd like, add this mix to your coffee in the morning. It tastes so good!!!

So rewind to last Monday, after a long weekend of sinus pain and tooth ache. I phoned the dentist and booked in to see him the next day. This tooth has been nothing but trouble. I had it filled and it still hurt, I had a root canal (at great expense I may add) and it still hurt. I went back in January, after putting up with it for six months, and he said there was nothing wrong with it. Finally on seeing him last Tuesday, he agreed at last to pull the sodding thing out! There was an abscess at the top of one the roots into my sinus cavity that was causing a lot of the trouble, but I honestly believe, even without this, it still would have had to come out.
Paroc's decision to abandon its first application and refile a new application for an additional class of services lost it any chance of appealing the OHIM Board of Appeal's first decision, which first decision then proved largely fatal to its outing in front of the General Court in relation to its second trade mark application. In Paroc's case, this was probably of little significance as its mark was so devoid of distinctive character, but it is easy to imagine cases where a Board of Appeal has genuinely erred, in which case following Paroc's strategy could matter greatly.
Now, you may (or may not) have noticed that that entire second list is composed of ways to help me keep the electricity-laden leisure lifestyle that we are all used to. Because I didn't have all those things, I washed dishes by hand, did the laundry by hand (yes, yes I did), figured out how to keep food coldish the old fashioned way, etc. Which brings me to :
This morning I heard the resident come in at 6:30 and jumped up out of bed to talk to her. I told her about Nate's pain, his headaches, and throwing up, and that I was not comfortable taking him home today, especially for a 3 hour ride straight up in a car seat. She was fine with that and said to just see how it goes. A little later our case manager came in and took one look at him and said "Yeah, he's not going home today." (Then she said, "Does he always sleep with his eyes open?" I said, "Yes. I know, it's creepy.")

That means investing at a similar rate of return as others and being no more or less 'imperialistic' than its Western rivals.

Swiss Chalet is literally buying 13 weeks of 24 hour airtime on a dedicated channel, just to air a single, chicken-based commercial. With no actual entertainment value at all.

As something so important to society (never mind to my own tastebuds!), I have decided to share my own experiences with some of the most classic and important beverages: tea, coffee, beer, wine, and spirits…perhaps even something more exotic, from time to time. I will attempt to mix in historical and personal information along with the preparation and sensations of each drink. I’m not expert, to be sure, so if it appears I’m doing something grievously wrong to an otherwise good drink, feel free to let me know!

I want to hold my friends to account for the mistakes of their country, the United States of America. During the past week or two there was an uproar in the Islamic world, particularly in Afghanistan, over the accidental burning of Korans by US soldiers. It was retaliation against the humiliation caused by the American military presence in Afghanistan, which has the stated goal that it wants to combat the influence of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in the Middle East.

What grabbed my attention about Blurb straight away was the quality of their internal book layout, the costs of their books to authors, and significantly, they choose to hand over the tools of book production to the author by way of software download of Booksmart. This free software is the engine of Blurb’s whole business itself. Since 2006, it has continued to be a ‘work in progress’, with continued upgrades and updates in an effort to iron out glitches and make the hands-on publishing process for authors as easy as possible. It still remains an ongoing ‘work in progress’, and some of the issues I experienced myself seem to have been hanging around for the past couple of years.

A reason why reap so little fruit from so powerful a means, is because we assist at it after so cold and tepid a manner. If we reflected, as we ought to do, that Christ labours there for our reconciliation with his eternal Father, as most certainly he does, should we not join with him? He there endeavours to repair the honour our sins snatch from his Divine Majesty, and to satisfy his offended justice. We ought then certainly to keep ourselves at least united to Jesus as much as possible during the time of Mass, that so the Sacrifice may be fully accomplished according to his merciful designs on us.

With careful rotation and placement I was able to place four 5.5 inch tall carrots on a single cutting page. This was wonderful as I only had to make eight of the carrots. Yeah for saving cardstock!After cutting the carrots, I used my scor-pal to score all eight of the carrots. I then assemble the carrots.

Weapons. Your weapons make a difference. If you’re playing combat, you should never be using a dagger in your main hand. Yeah, rogue flavour, whatever. I don’t care. You want a fast dagger in the offhand, and a slow agi weapon in the main hand. Since most of the rogues I see are sporting heirlooms, my suggestions are a Venerable Mass of McGowan in the main hand and a Balanced Heartseeker in the offhand. Substitute a Dal’rend’s Sacred Charge for the mainhand if you like, but I tend to prefer the haste on McGowan.

If the portrait of Benjamin Franklin by Evert Duyckinick portrays a fatherly image, it is because this is the impression the artist is trying to capture, the wise and benevolent father. Penned by Benjamin Franklin, The Autobiography, literally and metaphorically, is contextualized in a father-son interrelationship. The fact that this memoir is addressed to Franklin’s son, and that his much-advocated virtues of self-improvement, industry, and truthfulness originate from his father, evince the framework of the father-son interrelationship. Moreover, metaphorically, the fact that Franklin reaches heavenward (heavenly father) for a higher, moral perfection also supports this father-son interrelational framing of the text. The accounts of Franklin’s life in The Autobiography testify of the benefits he reaped by heeding to the teachings of his earthly father, as well as the blessings he received by abiding by the precepts of his heavenly father. Perhaps, what is most memorable is that Franklin, by writing The Autobiography, has tried to inculcate his private and public male progeny (his son and the sons of America) the characteristics of an admirable American man – the very virtues of Franklin himself.

So when you’ve got your Quarterback of the future, who is going to start Day 1, you have to find him some weapons right? So the Colts went out and drafted two tight ends. One of which was his former tight end at Stanford, Coby Fleener who most had going somewhere in the 1st round (VALUE) and Dwayne Allen who excels in run blocking whilst also being a viable receiving threat in the 3rd round (he was expected to go in the 2nd round, VALUE). The colts also managed to add potential starters in running back, Vick Ballard and Wide Reciever T.Y Hilton who should compliment Austin Collie and Reggie Wayne well in the slot. One concern I do have is that the offensive line was pretty disastrous last year, now that Oline is without Jeff Saturday? Well, let’s just say the two rookie tackles Sherrod and Ilijana better perform this year, or Luck is going to have to use a lot less of that arm, and the receivers acquired by the Colts Front office, and a lot more of that athleticism.

Yet so many go on in their delusion. Many are very religious, quoting scriptures, putting on “good deeds” or an “amiable” personality when around others.

Then Saturday morning, we planned to have breakfast at the resort (they had a great breakfast buffet) and then go bowling at the on site bowling alley. What we didn't know is that the bowling alley didn't open until 2:00! So, we didn't get to do that. (And we still haven't heard the end of it) Instead, we headed up to the outlets to kill some time before they called about the waverunner. Our first stop was the Coach outlet ;).

RPG’s in particular are driven by the twin engines of progression through content and improvement of your character’s abilities. These are the yin and yang of WoW. Each brings about the other, and conversely, neither is possible without the other working in counterpoint. And when either is missing, the game stops. Steady progression through content rewards the player with commensurate bonuses to her character sheet, and those increases to the character’s power level allow for further progression into increasingly difficult content (without requiring any sudden jumps in player skill). The bulk of this essay discusses how modern WoW has broken away from this bedrock, detaching progress and upgrades from each other. In doing so, they have ousted the player from his position at the helm of his own gaming experience.

This means grading and imputing scores into the computer. Although, I won't be able to distribute the kids into their respective levels till next semester. I will need to do that with my new homeroom teachers. Classes are still being held, but a bit broken up. Wednesday is a "6-day" but some of that is having the kids watching a movie while I give a interview test. Then Thursday it is a true "6-day", but I have casual things planned. They will make a "Shape-book" and play a PPT Bomb game, which they love doing. Finally, on Friday things have been shortened and cut back to 4 periods. During that time of 30 minutes each, we will play another PPT Bomb game and they will get word search worksheets.

The original manuscript for Oh Come All Ye Faithful was written In 1743 by John Francis Wade who was a Roman Catholic from England. It was a Latin piece known as Adeste Fideles. During the Jacobite rebellion, he fled England along with other Catholics. To support himself he worked as a music teacher and also copied musical scores. When the persecution ended, Wade and other English refugees returned home and brought the song with them. Eventually, Rev. Frederick Oakeley who was an Anglican minister discovered the song. It inspired him and he attempted to translate it. His first translation read “Ye Faithful, Approach Ye.” Oakeley attempted a second translation which was more direct and read “O Come, All Ye Faithful, Joyful and Triumphant!” The melody of Oh Come All Ye Faithful has been credited to John Reading and John Wade. Most hymnals have John Wade as the author of the music and the lyrics.
You’d think an “anti-bullying” law named after a boy who killed himself after constant bullying would require school districts to report bullying incidents, include provisions for enforcement and teacher training, and hold administrators accountable if they fail to act. This law does none of those things. What it does do is say that bullying is justifiable if done out of “a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction”. This is an anti-bullying law that protects bullies.

The compilation of Ali Shariati's 2 lectures in the form of book Religion v/s Religion. The 1st lecture of the book gives a good insight to conflict existing between Religion of revolution (the radical religion) or Monotheism and religion of legitimation (the conservative religion) or Multi-Thiesm. It elaborates the fact that throughout history there hasn't been as such a non-religious rival of religion, but another false and status quoist religion has been the opponent. The one striking point on the Marxist claim of religion being 'a status quoist' and 'tool in the hands of few' is regarded true only for the false religion/religion of legitimation.

You may need to take some time out of work to improve your condition to the point where you can return and yes some people never manage this, but you can still lead a full life. Your past achievements do not vanish because you are unwell and you still have the rest of your life ahead of you to achieve whatever you put your mind to. First of all you need to take the time to make sure you are well enough, through treatment or just some time-out. there is still so much potential in you, you can be a success. You may wish to adjust your goals to make them more manageable with your illness but you can do so much, if you want to!
How cool, I thought. We were going to meet these two hot guys AND get paid to do what we loved – comedy.
So imagine my joy on popping along to a car boot sale this very morning, only to find it less populated than normal (overnight rain and a light drizzle putting off the fair-weather sellers). There, one seller (purveyor of £1 bags of sweets and other goodies), was selling off his last few boxes of Walkers Crisps with the Red Nose Day special flavours.
I mean MAN this is a dull, plodding, hackneyed piece of nothing. Who knew you could make The Hulk so boring? It’s got all the elements you’d expect a Hulk film to have, but they’re done incredibly poorly, and mostly it will just put you to sleep. Eh. Let’s…try and get it over with, I guess…
I used White Hammer Card to matt and layer my image and sentiment to add yet more texture, and I’m really happy with the finished effect. :0)
Now, though, her left hand throbbed too much for her to laugh about anything much. She’d wrapped a bit of her sleeve - already torn from the fall - around it, but she didn’t think it had stopped the bleeding. Her leg too, seemed to be tightening up as though the fall had damaged that too.

Okay, so I've been gone since late September, and I feel like I should probably tell you all where I've been. First, I had school, which I already explained. I was officially a college graduate on December 15th. We went out for Chipotle burritos to celebrate. I thought I'd rest over the Christmas break, then hit writing head on in January, along with hitting the treadmill (I haven't been on a work out regiment since before I got married, and all that busy college food has not done good things).
Abortion, a major issue, is being brought up because of new laws, like the one that may be passed in Kansas. These laws state that doctors, if pro-life, can choose to falsify information they give to pregnant patients to prevent abortions. This goes against the Hippocratic Oath, which they must agree to before becoming doctors.
“You don’t say?” I reply with a hint of scepticism. “How ill-informed I must be never to have heard of the fellow.”

Junie was an amazing character. Unfortunately, I didn't always find myself agreeing with much of what she did throughout The Opposite of Tidy. Luckily, Carrie Mac's latest gives the reader hope that Junie and the novel's secondary characters will pull through for the better in the end.
Medical experts said on Monday that the new report, published online on Monday in the journal Circulation, makes clear that electrical shocks from Tasers, which shoot barbs into the clothes and skin, can in some cases set off irregular heart rhythms, leading to cardiac arrest.

13. Millard Fillmore wasn’t really the first president to have a bathtub installed in the White House. The actual answer is more complicated. See the link below under “Additional Sources.” He was, however, a member of three political parties during his lifetime: Anti-Masonic (1828-1832); Whig (1832-1856, including his presidency of 1850-53); and American (1856-1860).

Growing up in Jaffa, Safa attended school at College de Freres until 10th grade. “Because I was a girl, life was different for me,” she says. I was very close to my brothers, but they were younger and I felt responsible to help them in their homework.” Her father worked painting cars in an auto shop in Tel Aviv.
Yes, in response. I put those words in bold print because when I first read them, I realized just how white-centered the novel and movie are. I think that had it not been for the movie, especially Gregory Peck's depiction of Atticus Finch, the novel would not have the status it has today. Peck's Finch, in his upright disdain for racism, fully embodied a particularly white and male aspiration of liberal nobility. But he does it all on his own; it's white individualism all over again. And, ironically, non-white people are part of that portrait, but only as props, as accouterments that flesh out the portrait. Any black unrest and activism that would no doubt have inspired and aided any such white crusader is entirely erased.

Another epic fail by the local weather forecasters this week. As late as Monday afternoon the predictions for this week were occasional rain and snow all week except for Friday. There isn’t a cloud in the sky as I look out my windows, and all mention of any type of precipitation has been removed from the updated forecasts. While it was cloudy most of the day yesterday, we received very little rain from the squalls as they passed over, and we really need the rain.
Ok fine, so girls around the world started to put in their “about” part in Facebook or any other social sites, that they “listen to bands” but on the contrary, they only know one band. Like this conversation I had on Omegle:
Turn heat down low, pop the lid on and leave to wilt kale for 5-7 minutes.
A probe tests the limits of what can be done to non-Muslims without provoking a violent or damaging response. Constant probing occurs at a relatively low level, and wears out the resistance of non-Muslims. The civil authorities in Western countries repeatedly give in to probes and allow incremental degrees of Islamization in the vain hope of stopping the steady drip-drip-drip of Islamic agitation. But the probes don’t stop; if Islam achieves marginal success in a probing action, then the pressure is increased at that point and new probes are launched. A successful push to permit the hijab in a courtroom is followed by a demand for the burqa. If an employer gives in and sets aside a prayer room, then foot baths are demanded.
The girls had their shots the day before and both of them were cranky as all get out. Yes, I’m one of those moms who vaccinates their children. I also sometimes feed my older daughter fast food for dinner. And, occasionally, I forget to put diaper cream on them. Well, now that I’ve aired my dirty laundry on the world wide web, let’s get on with the story…

Emma Swan’s life has been anything but a fairytale. A 28-year-old bail bondsperson, she’s been taking care of herself since she was abandoned as a baby. But when Henry—the son she gave up 10 years ago—finds her, everything changes. Henry is desperate for his mom’s help and thinks that Emma is actually the long, lost daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Yes, the actual Snow White and Prince Charming. Even stranger, Henry believes that Storybrooke, the sleepy New England town he calls home, is really part of a curse cast by the Evil Queen, freezing fairytale characters in the modern world with no memory of their former selves.
Been Down So Long – The Vinyl Stitches
We had heard that President Obama was in Tampa Friday evening so we figured that would make rush hour traffic that much worse. So we stalled a while, hung out at the park, and grabbed dinner at Rainforest Cafe. The Hubs was a little nervous about me driving at night, mainly because I hate driving at night but it was Friday the 13th, so we booked a hotel room for the night. So we headed back to the same hotel, checked into a different room, and settled in for the night. We woke up Saturday, got packed, and then had a slight setback. Em took a nosedive off the bed, face first into the chair leg. She busted her lip open and let me tell you....lips bleed like CRAZY!!!! It felt like it took an eternity to stop the bleeding. She was crying. I was crying. You would have never known I was a pediatric nurse. There's something that takes over you when it's your own kid. If Em was someone else's kid, I would have been cool, calm, and collected. But I was anything but that. A quick run to Centra Care (for some free medical advice) and we left with just a busted, fat lip and rug burn on the chin. I'd post a pic of her lip but I know the Hubs will get mad so I won't do that. But over a week later, we still have a slight split lip and some rug burn. She's a champ!!!

I'm pretty pissed off about the media coverage in France. I didn't expect a nation-wide party, and I'm sure that's not what's really happening. Not in the majority at least. Of course, there are some who are going to get drunk, and wave a flag, and celebrate like it's the fourth of July... but I didn't feel that way at all.

MM: If Greek mythology had a villain, it would be centaurs. These savage creatures, with the torso of a man and the body of a horse, were the ancient embodiment of all the worst parts of human nature. As a child I found them much more frightening than monsters like the chimera or the hydra because unlike them, centaurs might be anywhere. In the ancient myths, they are constantly crashing into people’s lives, breaking up weddings, assaulting women, and murdering innocents.

Teeming with enough vendors to empty your wallet and tempt every sweettooth, the festival celebrated New England's farmers, specialty food producers & artisans.

Our intrepid trio are not the only heroes in this story. Rising to the occasion we find an aging writer of western novels and a young boy who find themselves trapped in a hospital filled with replaced staff. We find a criminal minded vagrant and a young retarded man who have to escape from a city jail staffed by replacement police officers. We find most of the congregation of the Riders in the Sky Church who take up arms against the monsters in their midst and establish a kind of fortress against the invaders.
This practice of inbreeding will never go away in the Muslim world, since Muhammad is the ultimate example and authority on all matters, including marriage.

The new EO evokes fear because it is occurring in peacetime and, more specifically, when the United States remains the strongest military power on Earth. There is no indication that an attack by any other nation is anticipated, so the implementation of the EO raises concerns that its purpose is not what it says.

The small niece-child is learning a bit of Spanish at school, which I think is no bad thing. As is the way with these things, it is the purest accident: one of the teachers happens to be Spanish, it's not in the school prospectus. The idea of a school prospectus bewilders me slightly as I'm of that age when you went to your local primary school unless your parents were particularly keen Roman Catapults in which case you went to the nearest R.C. similar. And that was the end of it, none of this trawling through prospectuses, web sites and league tables and poring one's way through the Ofsted reports. Not that I hold much faith in the latter anyway: every school I go past in the course of an ordinary week has a big banner strapped to the front boasting of its Ofsted plaudits ("Sums were enthralling" — Harold Hobsbon). It pisses me off to think that the money schools are spending on Ofsted Plaudit banners could fund a medium-sized county library service book fund for a year.
Step 6: Throw some stats on there. Like, what was his allowed batting average with runners in scoring position in 1993, and where did that rank among major league pitchers? That’s the crap kids these days want to know about. Kids these days are freakin’ nerds, with their baseball cards and weird stats and what not. GET OUT THERE AND PLAY, AMIRIGHT? Neither here nor there. Anyway, get some more stats. And some words. Throw ‘em all over the place. Make a chart or some shizz. Oh, use your computer for everything I am saying, or ask one of your computer nerd friends or an aforementioned nerd child.

Peggy Orenstein offers an interesting take on the Extreme-Homemaking-as-Feminism trend in a piece entitled “The Femivore’s Dilemma” in this week’s New York Times magazine, and while I can get behind the sentiment (I’m a card-carrying Pollanite; I’ve seen Food, Inc.; I buy my organic, grass-fed beef from a friend of mine every Saturday at the farmers market and can rant for hours about the environmental degradation wrought by the food industrial complex, and don’t even get me started on the antibiotics…), there’s just something about the phenomenon that ruffles my feathers.
A person's image of God is most often formed by how they see their father. My father abused me for years so I had a hard time relating to God as a loving Father. For years, I saw God as an angry, punishing God.

To start off, I boiled my lids and their rubber ring, just like you would with regular lids. The white lid you see in the pot is just like the regular metal canning lid, although it's not metal. The red ring you see is a rubber gasket that provides the seal. It is also re-usable.
However, that can only be achieved if there is better co-ordination and co-operation between the Welsh Government’s international branch and the UKTI in 2012. Not only could this begin a long overdue entente cordiale between the two administrations but, more importantly, should benefit the Welsh economy at a time when businesses need every help they can get.

Oh, yeah, and did I mention, this photo was taken while I was running a marathon. A frickin’ marathon and people thought I should be worried about how I looked. This was one of the proudest moments of my life and, forgive my language, but I’ll be damned if I let anyone take away one second of the pride and joy I feel about completing that marathon because I don’t fit into their perfect package of what a woman’s body should be.

3. This from Bernard Ashley (let's face it, if he's had problems, anyone can): focus on the ones who are listening, not on the ones who aren't. Don't be distracted by those not paying attention; seek out those who are and speak to them. They wanted to come and they wanted to hear you. They want to ask questions and to buy books, so screen out the rest of them. If need be, make some time after the others have gone to talk to them individually or as a small group.

Portraits in banners and posters: The revolution involved nationalist, socialist and Islamist ideals as depicted by key political figures like Ayatollah Khomeini and Muhammed Mussadeq (picture 1). Over time, the number of images representing Ayatollah Khomeini took on such an important role that it almost overshadowed the role people themselves played in fighting for their liberation (picture 2). Picture 3 metaphorically stands for people’s total identification with Khomeini, where individuals completely disappear behind the transcendental figure of the leader who has become a symbol of order and clarity.
Baekhyun is really upset now. Seriously, he really want to stab the ahjussi who sell his favorite kimchi with his long knife.

For years people asked, “Are yo going to South By?” And for years the answer was, “Not this year.” The truth is, we never went down to SXSW before now because we wanted to wait to do it in style. Finally, 2012 is our year and JC Brooks & the Uptown Sound are ready to fully embrace the festivities. With 9 shows and parties to play, we’ll be insanely busy all week and that’s just how we like it best. It’s an honor to be a part of the festival at all. But as always the case with us: we Want More than to just play a couple of shows and have a couple of beers. We want to represent Bloodshot Records, new sounds in Soul Music, Chicago, and all the fans who’ve believed in us up to this point as best we can. SXSW is a party, a convention, and an inevitable stop for touring bands in a record push, but for us, it’s a chance to get our message out. And to let folks know we are contenders.
First, make sure your dough is at room temperature (get it out of the fridge 1hr be4). Punch the dough down with your hands to release the air – although mine hadn’t really risen all that much, to be honest – then knead again quickly. Work out how many buns you want (I did 7) and divide the dough into that many bits, rolling them into balls.

As a child who suffered from crippling shyness, I was desperate to avoid having to go to kindergarten. Just one more year with mom was all I wanted. All I needed. And then, I would promise to off to school. I would promise to be good and smart and happy. I would promise to make friends and be popular. I would promise. But they sent me anyway. They sent me – a mere five year old no less – off into a world that was big, scary, evil and alien. A world that would surely eat me alive. It had to. Don’t ask why, it just did. The kids on the bus were already connecting into circular cliques, creating alliances and gangs. They stared at each new rider and quickly determined their worth. I was found lacking. Or at least I’m sure I was, seeing as I was the one who sat directly and immediately behind the driver, so as to duck out from under the crossfire of condemnation. I slid all the way across the hardened cracked plain of carsick green, and placed my face against the cold smeared glass of the window. My mom stood there, waving. Her smile was one of kindness and support, but I saw only a sneer of delight of finally being rid of me.
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision to overturn the lower court has essentially declared that government and the will of the people trumps all. Their unfortunate decision relegates property rights to a kind of constitutional ghetto where they can be routinely cited as necessary for the benefit of the owner, but only until the government decides they’re not, and even then only as a matter of convenience to promote the governments position as being superior to the owners.

Unsurpsrisingly, most of the discussion entirely avoids considering the option of a full-scale co-operative business, where risks and rewards are shared between those who work in the business, who are also its owners. The suggestion that workers might own and control their workplaces is part of the real alternative that may not be articulated. Whether we look to the Basque Mondragon Group or our own Suma Wholefoods co-operative we see a model that is stable, sustainable and just: a model that could form the basis for a national economy we could all buy into.

There are several times where very difficult decisions had to be made, and I admire the character for being able to make those unflinchingly. I loved watching her attempt to adapt to different cultures. I really liked how she apologises when she’s in the wrong, and how she’s determined to fulfill her duty as the bearer of the Godstone. The character rarely felt sixteen to me. Often she seemed much older, but I can find that believable as a simple function of having been raised a princess.
When I first met you, you loved love… maybe love is eternal.
Example: From as young as I can remember I had severe hay fever allergies that started without fail August 1st each and every year and never subsided until the first frost. My allergies were so bad that most of the days I couldn’t even see because my eyes were swollen shut. I happened to be born in August. Every year I had the chance to renew my energy cycle, every year, I didn’t. Couldn’t… I was bound to a family, a belief system that did not serve my higher purpose but I was too terrified to be myself.
This thing had been painted multiple times, and quite a few coats stuck together on the wires. I sanded it and used a wire brush to remove the big chunks. Then I primed and painted. That took forever to get both sides of the wires and the inside. Just when I thought I was done, I'd pick it up and find more white.
It can surely only be the fear of being alone and the unfamiliar that drives us forward (or at least i hope it is). After all when you have a new partner your as happy as that Larry chappy again right? I mean you become relationship 2.0 right? The new improved couple for the modern world. So why do people still sigh and smile when they think about their first love why isn’t more of ‘THE LYING BASTARD CHEATED ON ME’…. or some other rant not ‘Oh he bought me flowers and it was wonderful’.
Don't cry, I thought harder. Don't cry don't cry don't cry. But my mother had her arm around me.
I can’t imagine a better snippet of dialogue to catch the way these Girls of Dunham’s articulate exactly the kind of emotional and intellectual chaos I see in my students of the same relative intelligence and class status. They’ve got a whipsmart quick-wittedness that serves as the lingua franca of young women — self-identifying as smart, self-deprecating, funny, astute, sometimes brutally honest. Traveling in packs with the volume jacked up, these girls’ verbal patter can reach a manic level. But they’re neither self-aware nor knowledgeable enough to know how idiotic they sound to everyone who lives outside their tribe. The patter covers up a lot of the neurotic uncertainty.
The 2011 Green Bay Packers season was one to remember for both the good, the bad and the ugly. The good was their 15-1 regular season record and the high powered offense led by the NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers. The bad was the loss to Nick Collins in Week 2, but most notably the bad was the playoff loss to the New York Giants in Lambeau Field. The ugly was the way the defense played all year giving up tons of yards threw the air and having virtually no pass rush all season long while missing way to many tackles.
Apart from her being very cute and pretty, this is what caught my attention:

But despite Gormley's best efforts to boost morale the tensions are evident. The glory of being in government has turned sour for many ordinary members. They did not envisage themselves hatcheting services, imposing levys and cutting jobs. In particular the planned education cuts could be that step too far....

I am pleased to say that my strategy was a complete success. Not only am I gorgeous as always (9 out of every 10 women polled said they’d rather do me than eat a hot dog) but I am now also sporting a heavenly tan. It’s fair to say even Gisele would be jealous.

Do I honestly think that there are MIBs out there spiriting away giant skeletons into an unmarked warehouse someplace? Not at all… but I think it’s safe to suppose (at least for the sake of a good pun) that someone may have a few “skeletons in their closet” that they just aren’t talking about!
Didn’t matter. The couple sitting next to him were paying attention. I heard them talking about how it had been 15 minutes since he left. The wife was going to check on the status of the flight (it was about 4:40 at that point, and no plane had arrived), and her husband told her to mention the bag abandoner to the gate agent.

Good morning all! It will probably be afternoon by the time I post this since I have yet to take pictures, but I’ll pretend it’s still morning. I like this outfit and I hope you do too. I’ve had this dress forever, it was a hand-me-down from my sister. I think the first time I wore it was four years ago. Since it’s extremely short, I thought I should wear it with extra-thick tights since, you know, it’s still winter. The dark purple tights bring out the light purple in the dress, and I like the contrast between the dark purple and the red stripe. My everyday boots and denim shirt keep it casual. As much as I love designer clothing, you don’t need a label to look good.
Definitely, annoying habits and less-than-appealing behaviors will surface. Yet as Christians, we are called to respect everyone including our spouse.
I know this challenge could be hard for some but I hope this challenge can be more about the celebration of ALL the woman in our life...can you imagine your life without the other woman in it? I certainly can't, and even the idea is bringing tears to my eyes...
I was unhappy with my performance during last year’s marathon (my first). Although I finished, I walked a good deal between miles 18 and 24. I wasn’t walking because I was out of breath. I was walking because I was out of energy (despite frequent infusions of Gu). Not only did my legs feel heavy, my inner and outer thighs and lower back ached. When I did run, it was a hunched over, head-down shuffle. I felt that I could have trained for a better performance.
People seeking a decent pension want as good a return on their investment as possible, it's not for medicos to decide their conscience for them. In fact, I'm sure regulatory bodies would have a stern word or two for any investment fund which wasn't doing their damnedest to maximise returns for their investors.

We’ve had some modest success with promotions for the memoir, and decided to try something to see whether we could expand on that a bit: another promotion this coming Mother’s Day. But this time it’s going to be something more: the chance to get three different books, all for free in the Kindle edition.
Maybe the trial of the sick beast from Oslo is what is needed to shed some light on these matters and set the record straight. If that were to happen then at least one good thing will come about as a result of this deeply tragic event. The accusations from the Left shouldn’t be allowed to remain unchallenged, because they are incorrect and their rhetoric reeks of intellectual dishonesty.

Still, Simic is right: the ideal citizen of a politically corrupt state is a gullible dolt. But the real problem here is not the production of gullible dolts; it is the cycle of political corruption.
More, more, and more. Always more. I wish we had more time with Linn – more time to enjoy her warm generous spirit, her kind heart, her huge talent, and her way with words. She contributed so much to our group, and we’ll remember her always.

Iffin we had to hazard a guess—and it is, to be sure, only a guess based on little more than clouds of pink cotton candy—we'd guess Miz Witherspoon( and Mister Toth) have planned or embarked on some renovation or another to one of their several homes and merely visited the aforementioned, currently under-renovation residence in Bel Air in order to get a good look-see at samples of the handiwork of one or more artisans and/or contractors. Make of all this nonsense what you will but our money is on Miz Witherspoon et famille stayin' put.

Elizabeth Banks, like Stacy Keibler, also opted for a deeper brow color than many of the blondes we’ve highlighted so far. Whether they’re false lashes or extensions, Elizabeth went for broke with MAJOR eyelashes and a beautiful seafoam shimmer eyeshadow, and her brows needed this amount of color for the right balance. Although not as dark or precisely shaped and groomed as Stacy’s, Elizabeth’s have a more organic and natural shape, and are nicely filled. Were her makeup artist using BrowPro, she would have used Medium Light on Elizabeth.
Best Books of 2011? How on earth to choose? I've read so many wonderful books this year - 2011 has been a veritable treasure-house of offerings. There have been new novels from authors who are already favourites of mine, and I've also had the exciting adventure of reading great debuts from new writers who I know will be favourites of the future. The books I've chosen here are ones which have stuck in my memory for one reason or another - and from me that is the ultimate compliment. I read very very fast indeed, and don't tend to retain much. If I did, my brain would overload and explode. I make no apologies for the fantasy-heavy bias - that's what I enjoy most, and this list is about what has given me most pleasure. So, without further ado, and in no particular order (except alphabetically by author), here are my choices for 2011....

“According to Von Tilzer, he was approached in 1899 by Lamb with the lyrics for a song. Although Von Tilzer liked it, he asked Lamb to change some of the words to make it clear that the woman in the song was married and not a mistress. Later that evening, as he worked out a melody at a piano in a public house with some friends, he noticed that many of the girls nearby were crying, which convinced him the song could be a hit.”
Dario Argento's thriller stars the director's daughter Asia as Anna Manni, a policewoman trying to capture a vicious serial rapist and killer. The problem is that she suffers from "Stendhal's syndrome", a psychosomatic disease that gives her dizziness and hallucinations when she is exposed to the sight of paintings and artistic masterpieces. When the maniac lures her into a trap inside Florences' famous Uffizi museum, her troubles are just beginning...
Does this say that Christ is the end of the law for some who believe? Does he say that Christ is the end of the law for every one who believes except a remnant of Jews to whom God has imputed righteousness outside of a belief in Him?

One of the most important skill you need to survive Montreal is the “beary-hairy-body” to endure the cold of the winter. But if you, like me, didn’t receive the blessing of the gods and still feel the biting of winter, you might want to follow the following guide on knitting and make yourself a sweet home-made scarf which will make all your friends jealous.

So Paul snapped away. Afterwards, one of the girls held out her hand and asked for 20 soles. I thought ok, we were warned about tourist traps, so I paid her a 20. Then the other two girls held out their hands and kept gesturing for more. Saying they had to pay for the baby to eat. It was 20 each, or 20 for baby llama, baby Quechan and a third 20 for them. Yikes. I paid 60 soles and we got out of there before they could ask for more. Alright, we were had once. And we learned.
Her travelling companion for the night, True South Events Manager Tanya Harrowell, was there to keep Sam company (but I have to secretly suspect she was there to see just how a beer tasting/food matching event is run by a seasoned professional). Having said that, spending some quality time with Tan made me realise a couple of things. One; True South is a definite ‘Go To’ destination for the whole hospitality and beer experience and has some pretty cluey staff on board and, two; Sam is a pretty darn good person to work with!

Many of those present first became involved in the struggle when they were in their early twenties and did so at a time when the forces of state repression-during the Kenyatta and Moi regimes- were quite ruthless in crushing any perceived dissent. Now here they were, in the graying middle age, wishing a speedy recovery and paying homage to the Prime Minister who had gone through more than his own fair share of travails and tribulations.
Put simply, any list of the finest dozen or so American comic-books ever which doesn't include Boys' Ranch probably isn't worth paying attention to, while any such ranking which doesn't have the justly famous Mother Delilah - from #3 - in one of its first few places can be safely ignored. Of course, you already knew that, but we do live in a culture in which most everything from the past is easily accessed and yet also so strangely ignored. It can't hurt to add even the faintest and most redundant of voices to the chorus which celebrates the preeminent virtues of Boys' Ranch. And so I have.
'Do you know where we are?', she filled my field of vision as she stood before me, hands shoved in her pockets.
Much legend attends Bunker Hill. As General Howe’s forces advanced on the Yankees, General Putnam is said to have declared famously to his anxious troops: “Don’t shoot until you see the whites of their eyes.”
Yes. My real name is Jillian, but most people in person call me Jill or Jilly. My brothers call me Bird. I’m a little startled sometimes, when people call me Jillian out loud, because most of the time only teachers call me that. It doesn’t bother me though! I like the name; I just rarely hear it.
The court described the case as ‘yet another round in what has been described as the conflict between the electronic equipment industry and the entertainment industry’, in which the actions of an entity that ‘facilitates’ copying, rather than the consumer who is the beneficiary of it, are called into question. The role and responsibilities of intermediaries who develop businesses based on content produced by others is a key feature of the current debates about copyright policy. Interestingly, Melbourne barrister Warwick Rothnie in his blog IPwars.com, has queried whether there might be implications from this decision for the liability of internet service providers for the actions of their subscribers.

4. Oscillo/Oscillococcinum: This homeopathic can be used at the first sign of the flu to shorten its duration and lessen the severity of its symptoms. Or, you can take it during the flu for a similar effect, though it does work better at the beginning. It lasts for a while so keeping one box on hand is a good idea so you won’t have to run to the store when you feel yucky.

After dinner we headed to the hot air balloon glow which was inside this year. Because it was so windy they moved the balloon inside and inflated it with a fan and let everyone actually go inside the balloon. After the seeing the balloon we ended the night with fireworks on the tundra.
"If it has, Kos can do the next jump." Jashi's frown was at least part humour, Pevan was sure. She followed the other woman out of the gloomy barn, blinking against the sunshine. Jashi looked skyward straight away, and lasted all of half a second before she looked back down, pressing a hand to her brow and wincing.
Do straight men simply not shop? No. That is obviously a gross misunderstanding. Straight men obviously are still going to stores and buying things, but their first priority is not and will never be clothing. While the world still produces the latest electronic gadget, high powered grill, and various car crap straight men will not be shopping at a site called "Rue La La."
During what in retrospect has been a lifelong awakening I criticized and ridiculed political correctness and the liberal illogic behind it without even understanding their origins, pervasiveness, or monstrous power. It was only in the last few years, and especially the last few months, that I have had the time and motivation to dig deeper.

In Chingola we were fortunate to have been put in touch with Bobby & Kerry who treated us to a meal at Chingola’s (and quite possibly Zambia’s) finest Indian cuisine. Bobby and Kerry are expecting their first youngster, so we had the honour of testing out the nursery room.
You might not have another book contract, but you can still give inside information. If you might (possibly) be doing a sequel, give some clues about it. If you have nothing in the future (hopefully not!), give some insight into how this story came about. If the main character is based on your dog, or started as a ghost and turned into a vampire—talk about that.

I think that I've grown up over the past 8 years. I've learned that I'm not going to be a famous singer/songwriter. I'm not going to write music with the ease and hypnotic pull of John Mayer or Norah Jones. I can still only play five chords on the guitar. And my piano is wasting away in the garage.
Social Networking: Believe it or not, the use of social networks, in a business setting, is not to get “Likes” and “Followers,” but to provide another vector for you to engage your online audience. As I stated before, you don’t have to blog everyday to interact with your audience, there are people out there that do that for a living. You can use those already existing articles from sites/blogs that you regularly visit yourself. Your audience will be thankful to you for providing them with the extra information, and the site/blog you’re referencing will be thankful for the referral. As you may have guessed, I am quite a tech nerd, so I regularly read sites like Mashable, Tech Crunch and Gizmodo to stay up-to-date with tech news. I regularly find useful articles on those sites and can share the links on Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter so the Alloy Productions audience can get useful information without me having to sit down and write an article everyday. I can also share links from my current client base, making their online presence more meaningful and giving it a wider reach.
France is on the verge of starting its presidential election, with the first round of ballots to be held on April 22, 2012. The man in the picture illustrating this post, Mr Francois Hollande, is likely to become the next President of France, because current opinion polls put him at around 6% ahead of the incumbent President, Nicolas Sarkozy.
