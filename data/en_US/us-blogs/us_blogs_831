I wanted to face her/talk to her personally but we had no time and we needed to escape and it was too risky, and so I started shooting her with my gun while she was not looking; and someone else on my team started shooting her as well, and then we either ran and/or we ran closer to make sure that she was dead.

I'm not sure--I haven't quite decided--but I think I rather like it. Not just the color, but the whole current fashion reboot. All those loose fitting, blousy, off-the-shoulder shirts and sweaters are certainly a lot easier on a frumpy frame than the low-riser, skin tight cuts of two seasons ago. I'll tell you that much.
He’s a freaking warrior. He stands tall in the midst of a crisis and keeps his shit together in a way that I’m not capable of. He’s able to separate logic from emotion and he’s careful with his words, even when his crazy wife is throwing a full blown adult temper tantrum.

Is this how the future of medicine will look? Will it soon be normal for patients to monitor themselves, get early warning of illnesses and take preventative measures? Or is self-tracking nothing more than an extreme form of hypochondria?
DEPTHS OF HELL — Satan today expressed his disgust at the level of cruelty and nonchalance displayed by the owners of Petknode, the ‘pet hostel’ found to have housed over 90 cats, in addition to more than 200 others in their private residence, in highly deplorable conditions during the Raya holidays. About a dozen were already dead by the time rescue arrived, while the rest were dying, most nothing but skin and bones.

or how annoyingly painful its voice could be in your head, not to mention its almost omnipresence. One could get used to the headache and one could learn to keep at least some thoughts private. The brightest spot of midday sun or the darkest hole where no light casts any shadow offered an occasional moment of peace, too. However, that sound - this booming and yet whispering voice - it always sent shivers down my spine and made me feel slightly sick.

Most people assume the Sodomites were destroyed because they were homosexuals, and though the Biblical account does imply this as a partial reason, there were others as well.

Outside the house itself is her garden of course and this is worth mentioning because it picks up on something that Galgut used in his novel The Impostor. It could be seen as a possible metaphor for the new South Africa, or even the abilities of whites and blacks to co-exist at all but the cultivation and teasing of life from the soil and Clare's power struggle with her gardner Adam are just some of the ways in which horticultural references illuminate the politics of everyday conversation. It may only be a disagreement about whether to grow vegetables or not but it seems to be loaded with so much more.
“Glen,” by the way, is the Scottish word for river, and when a whiskey’s name starts with Glen, the second part is the name of the river on which the distillery is located. In this case, Rothes is both a tributary of the Spey and the town name.
God the Father has always existed as the Father. He had no beginning; He had no father. The term “Father” implies that the Son is subordinate to the Father in func­tion rather than implying that the Father conceived the Son (Isaiah 44:6; Revelation 1:8; 21:6; 22:13).

“I think this is widely perceived to be the cry of the older woman, but I think what’s actually true of all women – regardless of age – is that the stories the writers want to tell have women taking the supporting parts,” she says. “So they are the wives, the mothers, the teachers, the social workers of the central protagonist who is often a bloke. And I think the majority of women in this country would say that they are very much at the centre of their own drama. You know, 50 per cent of the viewers are women and I think there’s an appetite for really interesting, three-dimensional female characters, whether they’re 25 or 65.

God longs to see mankind return to Himself and He knew humanity would never be able to do so on its own. Thus the reason God chose to pay our debt to sin (the wages of sin is death) by allowing His only Son, Jesus Christ, to die (John 3:16). Christ’s blood paid our debt (Hebrews 9:22b), and His sacrifice became God’s free gift of eternal life to all of mankind (Romans 6:23b). God never intended to condemn us (John 3:17), sin did that on its own. Jehovah only wanted our love and worship. Remember, death is what we deserved but eternal life can be ours, free of charge, if we will only trust in God, obey His will, and believe in His Son.

The owner, who spoke hindi, gave me a large glass full of sugarcane juice which was cool and refreshing and promptly refilled my glass when I finished it. It was a really large glass and I struggled through the second one and had to actually hide the glass away for he was threatening to refill it again. Then he showed me the whole setup, all of it right there in the open field. First there were the bundles of sugarcane, all completely organically grown, and I was asked if the sugarcane in Punjab is similar, it did seem to the be the same smooth green supple kind, unlike the bleached white ones that are used in the cane-fresh shops in Bangalore. The grinding for the juice was done on this mill that was turned by a pair of oxen going in circles, who were now sitting in the background. The juice went through a pipe from the mill to a large pot placed in the next field which was a step lower. Then it was boiled for a long time over a large earthen oven and cooled in boxes placed in dug out pits in the earth. He insisted I taste some of the jaggery that was cooling, it was still warm, thick and viscous and tasted so good. This is the way it’s been done for generations, I was told, right in the fields where the cane is grown. There were already about ten big plastic boxes of jaggery placed along the edge. All to be distributed amongst family and friends, none of it sold in the market. I asked the owner where he lived and he began to insist that I come visit his home, which was just up the hill we were standing on. But we had to be getting back and so we took our leave and I promised to visit the next time I was there.

Historical fiction is a problematic genre. On one level it’s great for the author because he or she has the plot already laid out for them and all they have to do is fill in the blanks (which is a gross oversimplification, I know); the reader on the other hand has the worry that as he or she knows in advance what’s going to happen they will find little to surprise them in the text. An excellent example of getting it right—okay, I know, it’s a film—is the script to Apollo 13 which had me sitting on the edge of my seat and I’d lived through it. Good historical fiction is not simple biography: Mr X went here on such and such a date and did y. It has to do more than inform; it has to engage and involve.

(And things are work are not exactly easygoing right now either, which only contributes to my stress levels.)

We however learnt that an older prophet who dwelt in the land after being told all that had happened, pursued after the young man and asked him to come with him to eat and drink. Initially the man of God refused, reiterating God’s warning, but he later consented when the older prophet lied to him that God’s angel had told him it was OK for the young prophet to come with him to dine.

Not much other than root vegetables and hot house plants are in season right now, but if you take a bundled walk around your backyard or neighborhood, you will likely find a rose bush or two adorned with these blush berries called rose hips. I'm sure if you ask, your neighbor wouldn't mind you taking a few (though they may question your sanity). They can be picked as early as after the first frost October/November and as late as the spring. Don't take them all though, as birds rely on them through the winter, or so I read.
We have been told by the highest sources that Blackwater/Xe and other US based mercenary groups have been actively attacking police, military and intelligence organizations in Pakistan as part of operations under employment of the Government of India and their allies in Afghanistan, the drug lords, whose followers make up the key components of the Afghan army.

Then, popular-song icon Tony Bennett, in a radio interview, said the United States caused the 9/11 attacks because of its actions in the Persian Gulf, adding that President George W. Bush had told him in 2005 that the Iraq war was a mistake. Bennett of course came under some nasty fire. FOX News (September 24), carefully choosing its comments charmingly as usual, used words like “insane”, “twisted mind”, and “absurdities”. Bennett felt obliged to post a statement on Facebook saying that his experience in World War II had taught him that “war is the lowest form of human behavior.” He said there’s no excuse for terrorism, and he added, “I’m sorry if my statements suggested anything other than an expression of love for my country.” (NBC September 21)
The land they were about to inhabit would owe its existence to volcanoes too. The soils of the Chubut valley have been made fertile (in part) by the pale tuffs of old volcanic explosions swept to the valley by the prevailing wind from the Andes. And their final settlement, Esquel, is still periodically threatened by volcanic ashes. The last time was just last year when the Puehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex erupted in Chile.

THE PRESENT TENSE IS VERY STRESSFUL FOR YOUR READER. The flip side of the above point: if you haven't bored your reader, you've probably stressed them out. Think of the incredible tension of following every moment's move and thought and emotion--either there's not enough going on, and it's boring, or there is enough going on, and it's totally exhausting for the reader. Actually, this technique can work really well for high-energy thrillers, but if that's not your genre of choice, think about the unwelcome side effects. Frankly, life is exhausting to live--that's why we seek escapism in a nicely written novel--so don't make your book exhausting to read!
We had plans to go to the neighbor’s house to make beef sticks. They have the equipment and we were pleased to find out that we could operate it manually. I knew the chicks were out of danger so we drove down the road and spent about an hour and a half making beef sticks for the first time. It really was enjoyable. I will post some pictures later.

Based on a series of comics, Scott Pilgrim is incredibly stylised. It looks and feels like a moving comic. Pretty neat! The story and what the characters say during the film are all very clichéd. Hang on a minute, I mean in a good way! What I mean is that the characters and the story unfold exactly as they should in any standard comic. That’s not to say it’s dull, oh no. The geeky style and content keep you absolutely glued. In fact this was almost too geeky for me! It kind of frazzled my mind.

Deputy Pikett boasts that his dogs have performed scent lineups in some 2,000+ cases over the last 20 years. Vetting them is not an insurmountable task if somebody like the Attorney General decided to staff the project. I'm willing to bet this cop cleared by DNA wasn't the first person Pikett's dogs falsely accused, and it wouldn't surprise me if there are a significant percentage of false or questionable convictions in cases where Pikett testified or his "evidence" was used to pressure a plea bargain.

Recently, North Elementary hosted a “Family Math and Science Night: A Growing Experience” to highlight garden-based learning experiences. Families could choose from stations such as “Testing the pH of Soil and Vegetables”, “Container Gardening”, “Vermicomposting”, and “Garden Nutrition”, which I was able to lead. The children played a balloon activity to help them learn vegetable classification, and then got to taste test some fresh vegetables (unfortunately not locally grown due to the season) with a healthy dip.
Generation Y, those babies born in the 80′s and 90′s, have been dubbed the Generation of Entitlement. There is a plethora of articles from business journals to psychology magazines describing the typical attitude of Generation Y-ers. Early in my teaching career, seminars on how to deal with this type of attitude and expectations were common, even at major universities. We were warned that these generation of students were demanding. They wanted exams grades posted within hours of the exam. They wanted credit for effort, regardless of mastery or completion. The phrase “But I tried….” was fairly typical.

You may question this subterfuge, but in fact several managers ago we had a meeting where we were told NO exercises in our cubes. Someone had some 2 pound weights and was busted for doing arm lifts! Now in fact, we are entitled to a break, and if we choose to do some unobtrusive lifting or stretching, I can’t believe HR would object, esp. since at least in theory they support ergonomic exercises to prevent problems with all-day computer use. Maybe we have to do them in the break room instead of in our cube? In any case, with the memory in mind of the “no exercising” manager meeting, I sneakily try to do my arm stretches under the radar. Hence my unwillingness to fess up when I caused the stretch-band explosion!
I TRIED to find pictures on-line of garages to inspire me, but they all look like "man-caves"! Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it doesn't fit around here. Hubby pretty much walks through ours and stores a few tools there. The rest is me and the kids. Fortunately, we have an barn-like storage building that holds most of his stuff, so the primary use of our garage is for my work & supply storage, kids stuff, and if I'm lucky, a car.
The Arab Spring will soon put an end to all this, pundits tell us, and thus American taxpayers should pour millions of dollars into 'democracy promotion' efforts. Results guaranteed--you can bank on it.
Furthermore, as soon as the City learnt about the open toilets, they attempted to enclose them. But the ANCYL wanted them open, because it suited their agenda. The 55 open toilets happened to be located in the precise area where the ANCYL's leading "thugocrats", Andile Lili and Loyiso Nkohla, conduct their reign of terror. Given the contradiction between the community's wishes and the ANCYL's actions, there is only one conclusion: the open toilets were a direct result of the ANCYL's intimidation in order to drive their political agenda.

The Vikings have had their reign upon metal for long enough…now its time for the Pirates to have their say! Are you ready for some Drunken Pirate Metal? Alestorm’s approach to the folk metal genre is unabashedly elementary, but you can tell that they’re having so much fun it’s impossible not to play along. With tongue in cheek tracks like “Scraping the Barrel”, these fellas make fun of the fact that they’re not doing anything incredibly original, so (as they imply) you can listen and enjoy…or just suck it, and start your own damn band!
The bloke is off later in the week for yet another jaunt over the seas. My joy over his overwhelming career success must occasionally take a back seat to my bitter resentment. Only occasionally. Mostly it's just generic brand grumpiness at being a solo parent but there is a twinge of jealousy of getting to do the stuff you're really good at, for money and acclaim, unencumbered. A reflection on the limitations placed on my own work I guess. Anyway, ho hum same old same old.

Lulu.com, one of the most popular and cost-effective of the POD services and still independent despite the apparent trend toward consolidation among POD services, is explicit about its long tail business model. In a 2006 article in the Times UK, its founder identified the company's goal: "...to have a million authors selling 100 copies each, rather than 100 authors selling a million copies each." A Lulu bestseller is a book that sells 500 copies. There haven't been many of them.

Cultivated catfish were the worst, with 5 times the fat content of their wild counterparts. Plus, although the farm-raised catfish, rainbow trout and coho salmon contained as much or even more omega-3 fatty acids as their wild equivalents, in proportion to the amount of omega-6 fats they also contained, they actually provided less usable omega-3s.

Add to all of that the great times I spent before and during races with friends, brothers I rarely see and my dad, and when the green flag drops tonight in Richmond on the NASCAR Sprint Cup race, I’ll be missing my seat in the last row of the Old Dominion pavilion between turns three and four. Well, I’ll be emceeing a charity event so I may not notice right at that moment, but you get the point.

New Hampshire Brewer Festival (November 12th/13th at the Radisson Hotel in Manchester). This is sure to be a fabulous weekend of craft beer experiences. If you’re already a beer geek, you’ll have a good chance to sample some new brews and your old favorites, and have a great time while you’re at it. You can Learn Your Beer in some cool tasting seminars. This is a great opportunity to taste the good work of your local hard-working craft brewers, find a new “favorite beer”… and party and dance to great live music!
These declarations of war on integration from February, 2008 in Cologne and March, 2011 in Düsseldorf were fired off before an inflamed crowd of 18,000 people by the man who will receive the “Steiger Award for the Tolerance, Humaneness and Growing Together of Europe” — Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey.

Just a quick post to show off for you some roses I made for a friends fundraiser last night, so she could give them to some sponsors. The theme was "Mad for Plaid" and I had the good fortune of finding several different plaid patterned scrapbook papers. Now I am convinced that these roses look amazing no matter what pattern your paper has.

Of course this is one of the most widespread botnets to hit Windows PCs, but still, it’s only one of many that are out there for PCs. And although Microsoft made similar mistakes as Apple in regard to malware/viruses/botnets initially, they made up for it in time. They even put out their own antivirus/antimalware program – Microsoft Security Essentials for free to home users to help protect their users. But even with their experience with these things for many years and learning from their mistakes, there is this…
Did you watch Downton Abbey on PBS? If not, you missed a fantastic series filled with lush sets and costumes, romance, drama, the sinking of the Titanic and the beginning of WW1. All in 4 x 1.5hr episodes. You can download it from iTunes or buy the video set.
If it is you (and you know who you are and there are quite a few of you) please let me know why on earth you do it? It's bad enough doing the former, but then more hoops to jump through? Why? Is it a power thing? I get the odd bit of spam, but I just delete it. Simples. Best of all, just stop it. It is pointless and irritating.

A spokesperson for Savile Row, said: “Savile Row is known the world over as the home of bespoke menswear and is one of London’s most famous streets. As a result, we can appreciate Abercrombie & Fitch’s desire to be a part of this – the irony is that their presence serves as a gradual erosion of the very character of Savile Row that they wish to benefit from.”
This week won’t be full of awards and shortlists. It’ll be a week to immerse myself in the latest book, thinking about the characters, the way their stories weave together, the right words to choose. If it goes well, that’s the most exciting thing of all. Kenayna hara. Pah! Pah! Pah!

Then two discs of 2mm thick steel plate, so I need to make a trammel for my plasma cutter from whatever is in the scrap bin. Then zip out a couple of 12” discs. (I appreciate that only people of a certain maturity will know what Heavy Metal is and only those that are older still will appreciate the 12” disc gag). Finally bend some C section channels in the mini folding brake to make a frame around the outside. Then it’s just a case of assembling the puzzle and applying a lick of paint.

IaaS, of which Amazon Web Services are a good example, is similar to Robert bringing along his own mower, blower and other tools: my flat rate fee, in this case, covers the petrol for his mower but it also covers me should his mower break down: he will have it repaired or replaced, at no impact to me. And Robert, I know, has some of his old equipment also in the van, just in case: I not only have no need to worry about such issues I also have no responsibility to deal with those issues… and each Tuesday I return home comfortable that I will not have a weekend of yard work in front of me.
I still enjoy spending the day with the family at WDW, even without the horrible, horrible food that smells so ridiculously good. Disney has people manipulation down to a science. They know what smells are going to activate the caveman portions of our brains, and they pump those aromas out everywhere.

Fortunately, one of the reasons why we met online was because I worked nights in a call centre in England. I worked from 9pm at night to 6:30am in the morning. Your Mum was living in Oklahoma at the time (where you were born) so she was six hours behind. So what was the middle of the night for me was just early to mid evening for her.

My journey into the pitt’s of Hell all began on a warm August night. The year was 1985. At sixteen all I thought of was going out with friends and having a good time. I was just starting to grow and become my own person. The day I met my future husband – was August 12th. I will never forget our first encounter. Mark had brown hair and beautiful light brown eyes. We where instantly attracted to one another. We met at a party – my first – and probably his hundredth. Mark and I are six years apart in age – when I think back he should have had nothing to do with a sixteen year old – after all – he was twenty two years old at the time.
We are all flowers, pistils, pollen.

As far as your personality goes, you are still ALL over the place. We love your adventurous spirit, your independent flair, and your outgoing personality. The best compliment we got was from a friend, telling us that you will definitely be a future homecoming queen. We see a very sweet, kind little girl, who has a larger than life personality, and we could not be more proud of how you are developing. This love for you continues to fill our hearts.

Whenever you take digital photos, you transfer them from your camera to your computer so that you can save them, email them, use them with digital scrapbooking programs, upload them to sharing websites, post them to Facebook, etc. If you've been using a digital camera, then you know how easy it is to get those photos from the camera to the computer. And you probably store all your photos in one handy place so you can find them easily later ("My Photos", for example).
Here she is reading one of my old Rupert Annuals. These were full of good stories, and again peopled by strange characters, some of whom were very un-P.C. Some of her other favourite reads were the ‘Mr Men’ and Little Miss’ books of Roger Hargreaves, classic fairy tales and anything with a mermaid in it. A Rupert story featuring mermaids and merboys was a double bonus. When she was older she graduated to Roald Dahl.

“Ron”: Oh, they’re so cool. I can do this (again with the voodoo finger movements and several screens later). I can sit in the restaurant and look up what movies are playing then, (more finger movements) I can watch the trailer for the movie to see if I want to go see it. (Flips phone sideways to show trailer playing).
These I made for my aunt. She really likes sunflowers. I couldn't figure out how to texture the middle so I just poked a bunch of little holes. The purple flower ones turned out really nice. I shaped the marble-esque things out of an ugly clay that I couldn't use, stuck in the wire so that I could put eye pins later on, then did all the detail work after baking, finishing with glaze (which, shortly after, spilled everywhere. Good thing I'm going to JoAnn later!)

For the Classic White Bread recipe, click here. If you are going to bake this in a pullman loaf, bake with the lid on for 20 minutes, take from the oven and then bake for another 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown and until the bread sounds hollow when you knock on it.
Recently I had the pleasure of testing EcoStore USA's Herbal All Natural Ear Wash. The package says, "YOUR PET WILL LIKE IT", and I thought, "Oh yea, I bet they will...NOT!" It is a major ordeal in our house to clean their ears and I did not believe that this was going to be any different. But it was!

I’m starting to see all the benefits of running compared to some of the other types of exercise I’ve been doing. I come home exhausted with a huge sense of accomplishment 20-30 minutes later instead of two hours later after a one hour class. The roads are always open, and free, so no fitting in a class or driving anywhere and paying a fortune. I just tie my shoes and go! I can go in any direction, stop and start as I please and challenge myself any way I want. There is no one out there looking at me or keeping track of what I can or cannot do. It’s completely my own. I benefit directly when I make the effort and I don’t benefit when I decide to slack. No fake turning the resistance button on a spinning bike.

Even though Spoil of War has dropped off the bestseller list for Historical Romance in the US store, someone at Apple continues to give it some love as it still has a place on the What's Hot list for Historical Romance. It's still clinging to the What's Hot lists for SFF in the regional stores, too.

Chelsea is an eternal, ongoing circle of creativity. Nothing lasts more than a week, true, so it has something shallow and superficial about it, but at the same time, it forces you almost to have a sense of duty to go and see art. Chelsea gives you a deadline and you don’t want to miss out.
So, let’s look at what stops you from receiving the energy of love. There are many things…
I am very sad to be saying goodbye to the man who has become my favourite Doctor, Patrick Troughton, fortunately I happen to know he might just drop back one or three more times in the future. It's like when Zoe asked if they'd ever meet again: "Now, you and I know that time is relative, isn't it?" said the Doctor with a wink in his eye.

By the time I entered high school I was 5′ 8″ tall and the beginning of a body that would stop traffic. I was pretty and I didn’t know it. I was lonely and I didn’t feel it. I was depressed but couldn’t have put a name to it. I took my first drink of alcohol before I had my first date, and when that alcohol hit me everything was okay. In fact, I felt so good that I drank a lot more! The first time I drank I got drunk, I blacked out, I had the dry heaves and my best friend and her date took me home to face an enraged Mama.
Here are more two exercises from One Drawing a Day. I'm not moving along daily as I had hoped to do. I'm learning that I must make time to do the exercises and I am getting better at that-not great but better.

The case started a few weeks ago with jury selection. There appeared to be a greater chance of a conviction, as a result of Clemens having put forward his hypothesis of himself as a non user, than in the Bonds case where he was answering vague or open-ended questions with vague and open-ended answers.

The meal started off with pure indulgence: chicken tandoori crackling, followed by brioche with yuzu seaweed butter. The former, the creamiest chicken liver mousse dolloped on a square of crisp chicken skin. Salty, fatty, mineraly goodness; tastebuds piqued, big-time. The latter, a fluffy, buttery brick of brioche so comforting that a child would swoon over it, but spread generously with a decidedly grown-up compound butter with the bright Asian notes of yuzu and salty seaweed. I seriously spent the rest of the meal contemplating getting an order (or nine) of the brioche to go.

The girls were hard to occupy during the service. They were very focused, however, when it came to lighting our candle. Normally our Pastor would light his candle up front and then the flame would be "passed around" until everyone's candle was lit.

I don't remember exactly when I started watching the Oscars, but I remember the first time I watched it was in my bed. Since then it's taken a life of it's own. Now it's lushious dinner, Champagne, chocolates and whatnot. I also started out not so much interested in the actual awards. Now don't get me wrong, I still adore the red carpet and it gets my full attention, but the actual awards now get just as much attention.
Before I begin my next post topic, I thought I would catch you up on a couple of things. In my last post, I mentioned that we are now in Guangzhou. I don't know if it is because more Westerners are here for their adoptions (this is the city we ALL have to come to regardless of where in China our children come from) or because we are so close to Hong Kong, but I can finally access BLOGGER (sometimes...). I can't see any pictures and I cannot yet respond to your comments directly on the blog, but I can read my text and most importantly, read your comments! Thank you for the comments, it is so nice to feel we still have a connection back home.
That's living.
But at its root, the problem is that 500 years of genocide and colonization have made Indian women invisible.The reservations are isolated, and we easily drift into a dismissive disinterest, as if this is a problem in Bangladesh, or Botswana - far, far away. It's their problem.

The incredible ‘works of Seo Young Deok are clearly inspired by the shapes of the human body, but artists have been sculpting masterpieces based on our natural curves for hundreds of years. What makes this Korean designer special is the material he uses for his unique creations – bicycle chains. Miles of metal chains, to be exact, welded in such a way that they recreate the human body to the finest details. Deok says he finds inspiration for his art in crowded markets, and metro or bus stations, but also in Buddhist sculptures and paintings, which he has alway admired. “I like Asia Beauty” he says, “so most features of my work seem to take an Asiatic pose”.

We have had some serious growth spurts and the kiddies feet seem to have grown overnight! New gumboots were called for. Kiwis are in love with gumboots and I am a convert. Our long wet winters mean gumboots are great at keeping the kiddies feet warm and dry. They pop on and off at the door to the house and warm dry socks mean little feet are toasty. New grey truck ones for Rupi and pink strawberry shortcake ones for Blossom...

By throwing dust into the air they were condemning Paul for this was a method of judgment.

Even when you are coloring something black, rarely do you color the shadows true black (to keep it simple I'm not getting into shadow colors beyond this in these first few posts- for now just stick to Cool Grays or the BV20's for your white ground shadows).
In China, the world’s largest poor performer, the authorities sharply curbed coverage of the popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, retained blocks on foreign social media platforms like Twitter, and tightened controls on investigative reporting and entertainment programming in advance of a sensitive leadership change scheduled for 2012.

While many of my losses as a result of sexual assault can never be compensated, the opportunity that legal representation gave me to be heard and to have my experience acknowledged as an unacceptable crime, has allowed me to move on with my life. To have the very real impacts of sexual assault represented and heard in a court of law and acknowledged by a judge, has permitted me to heal some of the wounds created by sexual assault. The advocacy and support that North Melbourne Legal Service gave me through their representation restored my belief in the community and restored my sense of confidence in my place in the world.

Oh, and can we cut the morality crap please? Some folks are busting down bills like on-site sales b/c they claim we are encouraging drinking.

As she begins her seventh month in prison, those campaigning for Sori have published her letters from prison on the Internet. In them she exposes the details of what has happened to her in custody and writes, “I am willing to die but I did not commit any crime.” As civil liberties groups and women’s organizations remind us, she criticized the human rights abuses of the state and this can be considered a “crime” in the “world’s largest democracy.”
I think I broke out in a sweat. And then I read the rest of the email. Here, because I was vague, he didn’t figure out much about me. But, it seems that he was 28, and also had a yahoo personal ad…Yeah, but I guess his personal ad was under Guy looking for GUY!!!! He thought I was a guy…a 53 year old guy writing to him. So, yeah, I was writing to the wrong guy and the wrong guy was a 28 year old gay guy with the same name, from the same city, who also happened to have a yahoo personal. Uh, yeah.

Now, when the terrorist ideology of the radical left is combined with the effects of crony capitalism, we have a much more fertile environment for orchestrated social unrest than at any other time in history. Add to that an elected president with a communist heritage who launched his political career in the Ayers/Dohrn household, the timing is anything but coincidental, and the path to chaos should be quite clear.

“Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But suddenly, this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, swears at me, and jumps on my fingers! Well, I fell and just before I hit the ground, I landed in some trees or bushes which broke my fall. But I didn’t die immediately.”

The people you mentioned will bear closer examination from here on. =) Most, if not all of them, are wildly popular and are well-known for their writing skills.
That seems to be a accepted barter for the advantage to play the bold in a way added than intended. Admirable Theft Auto IV does the aloft thing. Use a bluff during your play affair and not abandoned does it conciliate online play and assertive achievements, but if you save, it shows on your gameplay stats. This prevents players from cheating for added than claimed enjoyment. That seems appealing fair to me.
In summation, there are really only a few key points to remember when dining at a fine restaurant. Be thoughtful, be patient, be understanding. Servers are human too; we aren’t robots able to produce a culinary miracle to satisfy your slightest craving at a moment’s notice. If you treat us terribly, just be prepared to know we’ve given you your own little nickname in the kitchen and, trust me, it’s not flattering. Neither is the portrait the servers and hostess are painting of you to the people who don’t leave the kitchen.
Can a smart phone be its own guardian angel? Can it keep an eye out for itself? And tell you where it is, when you don’t even know yourself?
So you can imagine the excitement when my Uncle W showed up from Germany with a crateload of cookbooks (along with a housefull of academic ones, but those were of no interest to us work shirkers). The cookbooks were exotic ones for what we saw as dreamy desserts like jam filled doughnuts and aurora cakes, and meringues and sachertortes. Uncle W was very protective of his books. We were only allowed to look at them in his house, and not allowed to take them away anywhere out of his sight. We oohed and aahed over them, but then went home to what we considered ordinary and everyday food. Even today, I look at a pretty dessert book, and I am scared to touch it, haha.

Heading in a westerly direction back from Hammersmith you pass the barges laid up before the Dove Inn, just passed the alley on the right hand side is the William Morris Museum which I still haven’t been in and onwards past the majestic houses that line the river on the way to the Fuller’s Brewery. Our walk ended up in Chiswick House the most fantastic Palladian villa built in 1729 and set in 65 acres, there we rested for tea before heading back via the allotments and over Barnes Bridge.
Fortunately for me, the internet feed that enabled me to see some of tonight’s game against Fulham was pretty awful, so I don’t feel I can rate all the players as I normally do, but I can make some comments.

There are some things in the book that seem a bit over the top, but for the most part Lisa offers a lot of information and advice to get you prepared for whatever life may throw you.
The good thing is there is no one-size-fits-all approach for many charming men and I have found a variety of styles they use based on the setting they are in, possibly their mood and depending on their mission. Down further I will break down the different types of charming men I have come across over time.

Culver’s equestrian center was recently renovated – and it shows. Each stall is endowed and each equine resident lives in immaculate splendor – great ventilation, automatic waterers, and superior flooring for the utmost comfort. The indoor arena is among the largest in the country and has a great seating area with perfect views of not only the entire arena, but the stabling area behind. (I stood at the back row to look over the entire expanse – very cool! Check it out on their virtual tour here.)
Lesotho nationals also continuously cross the border onto the Boer farms to cut down grass for their animals or graze their animals illegally on Free State land, both acts amounting to theft and the latter also posing a health risk to South African livestock and an economic risk to farmers and meat exporters.
Oh how I love happy endings...
It may be hard to imagine this if you weren't a kid at the time, but just look at that picture. I mean, there she IS -- it was as though someone had literally brought to life the iconic image of the character straight from the pages of her comic books. Plus there was that funky disco "Wonder Woman" theme song. What's not to love? Besides which, if you needed further evidence of the character's mythic status, let me simply point out that in our culture, even in the vapid Seventies, television is the ultimate cultural currency.
If knowledge is power, then social media and mobile technology are proving to be incredibly powerful tools. The future is full of possibility in this area, especially as new technologies and approaches emerge from developing countries themselves.
Susanna Quinn’s Glass Geishas went on sale this week and examines the glamorous surface and seedy underside of Tokyo’s infamous club scene.

The climatic scene of the movie is when Olaf discovers, if he marries the oldest of the three children, being 14-year old Violet, played by Emily Browning (Ned Kelly), he will inherit the parents’ wealth. So, he produces a play in which he will marry Violet, while all those watching think the wedding is not real. See what I mean? Dark, but not very funny.
If you've read Divergent (which I sincerely hope you have because, really, what are you waiting for otherwise?) then you'll remember that the majority of the book was set in the Dauntless compound with Tris training and undergoing her initiation into the faction. In Insurgent, the world has expanded and grown. We get to spend time either with or learning about all the other factions - Amity, Candor, Erudite and the factionless.
And it’s about the long game. We’re playing chess here in the publishing industry, not Big Stakes Texas Hold ‘Em. The industry is changing, almost daily. We all have to keep our eyes on the board to make sure we’re thinking that one great move ahead of the curve. It’s not about betting the pot on a single hand, a single card – it’s about pacing ourselves and setting ourselves up for a real win, one that we learn from and can repeat.
According to my observations, it usually takes one generation to lift a family out of poverty in Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro.

Dear Kim,
Paris. Septembre 1850
Many stories have been told of the traditional first Thanksgiving at Plymouth Colony in 1621. But not many know the story of Peter Brewster, the younger half brother of William Brewster. I’m here to fix that for you.
I just don’t feel like if I sit still long enough I’m going to fall asleep. Or that walking anywhere feels like I’m trying to walk through thigh high sand…or cement. I’m not D.O.N.E come 7pm and feeling like I can’t possibly give any baths or put anyone to bed. Lying here like a beach whale is all I can muster.
Thank you so much for your prayers and support. We really do very much appreciate you all.
May today be blessed for whatever faith you hold.
The Bureau of Internal Revenue has filed charges against Ang Galing Party-list Rep. Mikey Arroyo and wife, Angela Montenegro for their alleged failure to remit 73.85 million pesos in taxes to the government. But Mikey’s lawyer, Ruy Rondain explains the BIR should have given his client ample time to reply. After all, it’s not that easy to produce fake receipts.

As one of our three substitutes I decided to take the opportunity to ask him about his role. Sadly, he wasn't keen on conversation, which on reflection is probably an occupational hazard, what with the headset. For all I know he could have been in on a conference call with a host of delegates from FIFA's head office in Zurich. This is unlikely though. I would expect an organisation as spendthrift as FIFA to be more generous with the quality of employee trousers. By all accounts Sepp Blatter is a tolerant man, but badly pressed black trousers would not reflect well on FIFA. No, a far more plausible explanation was that his headset was plugged into a cassette player. The assessor would spend his evening listening to the recording in order to write his report on the referee's performance. Let it be said, the role of referee's assessor isn't all glamour.

Frustrating more than 50 years of bad science that has claimed the exact opposite, Ellison’s appraisal of fluoride’s negative effects on the body shows once again why removing fluoride from public water supplies is crucial to public health. And health freedom advocates must step up to be the educational catalyst for bringing about this change nationwide.’

2 years ago the Packers drafted a guy with percieved ‘short arms’, named Bryan Bulaga. A guy expected to go in the top 10 who dropped for that exact reason into the 20s. This year the Lions drafted a guy named Riley Reiff, who was also expected by many to go in the top 10, but his ‘short arms’ once again made him slide to the Lions in the 20s. Now that short-armed Packers lineman turned out pretty well I’d say, and I’d also say that these two cases are pretty similar right? Great value – I see this one working out.

What have I had to learn, over and over again, and yet I still don’t have that absolute understanding – that mastery? I keep coming up short, and making the same mistakes, time after time.
To throw off Hitler by revolution is one thing; to strangle Germany by an imperialist war is quite another. The howling of the “pacifist” jackals of democratic imperialism is therefore the best accompaniment to Hitler’s speeches. “You see,” he says to the German people, “even socialists and Communists of all enemy countries support their army and their diplomacy; if you will not rally around me, your leader, you are threatened with doom!” Stalin, the lackey of democratic imperialism, and all the lackeys of Stalin – Jouhaux, Toledano, and Company – are the best aides in deceiving, lulling, and intimidating the German workers." (p21)
These were the largest State projects – often described as being the flagship or centre-piece of this or that government’s policy – yet they were breaking the main rules and getting away with it. The ‘getting away with it’ is the cloudy part of the picture, because we never hear of any penalty being sought against those State Enterprise Directors who broke the governance rules.

After finishing up the baseball program in the morning I went out to the greenhouse/yard to do some work. The sun was actually out and it was comfortable working temperatures.
We started just a little after 8:30, I think, but close. The gate narrowed us down a little, but the field wasn’t huge so we all got out quick. I took off too fast, but tried to hold it as far as I could. I had to back off at about 3/4 of a mile. I could still hold a good pace, but it was slower. We went down a long hill on Kinwest Parkway right off the bat. This looked like it would be our “demon” coming back up for the finish. We turned a corner onto a side street at about a mile out. By then we were at our second water stop. I didn’t stop at this one and at the first, I barely slowed down. I got a little bit in me and some on me. I still haven’t’ figured out how to drink and run; just not that coordinated.

At 9:12 A.M. today, Mayon Volcano manifested mild ash explosion that reached an approximate height of 200 m above the summit crater before drifting east-northeast. The ash-ejection was recorded as explosion-type earthquake which lasted for one minute by the seismic network deployed around the volcano.Immediately after the explosion, visual observation becomes hampered by the thick clouds. During the past weeks, seismic activity had slightly increased and crater glow had slightly intensified. Precise leveling surveys conducted at Mayon from May 10 – 22, 2008 compared to February 17 – March 2, 2008 survey also showed inflation of the volcanic edifice.

It is said that Dickens was Scrooge, and that Dostoyevsky was old Fyodor Karamazov. I'm sure there is some truth to that. Some authors model their characters after people they have known, but I believe that most of us dredge them out of our own secret psyches. Dostoyevsky was Ivan, Dmitri, and Alyosha too—and most certainly the axe-murderer Raskolnikov. As that great author shows, people are deep wells springing from, and containing, many complex and contradictory currents. We hardly know what is half-formed inside of our minds, but I believe that every one of my characters is a part of myself—either what I am or what I want to be. In my dream life, I can be clever, thoughtful, and resourceful like Zan. And sometimes I am angry, bitter, depressed and violent like Dael—or awkward and "different" like Chul. (I hate that word, "different.") (Dwayne: I'll react to that - I totally admire Chul!)

The big hike! After breakfast we started with an Uaz-bus to Khinalik and could get 2600 m asl by car and went up to more then 3100. It was a great day with nice weather and besides the numerous Horned Larks, Snowfinches, Rock Pipits, Wheatears and other mountain species, we saw of course also Güldenstads Redstarts and Caucasian Snowcocks, both with great observations. We also had all four vultures, a Golden Eagle hunting snowcocks and an immature Imperial Eagle.
“When they answered, because all the Hispanics call them names in the hallway (white trash and the like) and always speak Spanish, they don’t feel they would want them to join them.

You are racists and don’t even know it, we are here to make you aware of it.”
But whether or not Hilary Duff wrote the book, the person who did deserves good props. The book is well written and has a great mix of suspense, mystery, and romance. My favorite part? The historical 'flashbacks' and the paranormal hint of it. It was a unique plot and I like how the book just ended with a cliff hanger.

I fell backwards, scurrying away from the glass entrance. The mirrored surface swirled with storm clouds over dark water. Eerie green phosphorescence bled into the rising clouds and spread out like industrial plumes of smoke. I watched crazed and shaking, drawn into a reflection of madness as the brutal face of Simu’la Re burst through the jet black sea, staring into my very soul. His face was a hideously deformed caricature of my own, a despicable double with a sniveling smile on festered lips.

Well, OK, this is grandson letting his silliness out! :)
Since that time, I've exercised off and on, depending on what other things are going on in my life. At several points I've managed to get myself in very fit shape. At other times (like at the current moment), I get a bit pudgy and soft. I need to get back into exercising...I know that. I just have to get into the right frame of mind to start on a regimen. At least now I know that I am capable of being fit.
Ye Gods! We've been there and have come back again. Incredible but true.
Or the time I decided I was going to leave my socks on to have sex because he never took long enough to warrant removal of socks. When we got done he literally got dressed and left. I was at his house. In the early evening. His mum and sister were right outside the room in the kitchen. BFF2′s partner says if you leave your socks on when you go to bed you sleep with the devil. This story just proves he is very bloody right.
Now, I don’t think I am necessarily judging a book by its cover… no – it more that I refuse to even read into the book unless the cover stimulates my mind. So for the past few minutes I have been pondering the notion of why that is. Why is it that I am not interested unless it catches my eye?

Lesson learned. There had to be a way to access my research notes and images from any computer in the world via the Internet. Posting the data in private directories on one of my websites was an option but I didn’t want to take the time to install and customize a CMS or other application just for these notes.

On the other hand, I wasn’t so impressed with Albom, the author. Albom had been a student of Morrie’s 20+ years ago, and somehow got in touch with this professor who had changed his life just as the guy was dying. He visits him on Tuesdays, although by “visit” he doesn’t mean strolling down the street, but flying hundreds of miles each time. Albom makes a list of big life issues troubling him, and each week asks Morrie to expound on them with the wisdom he’s sure Morrie has, since Morrie is dying (and of course, dying people are a veritable fount of wisdom).

I also loved how Trella's relationship with the scrubs changed - from being almost a spectre and talked about in excited whispers to being openly scorned and treated so distrustfully. It added a new dynamic to the already complex society structure.

I decided to try one more test- this was the most accurate. Some of my results:
Do you remember the end of 2010? I do. My very last blog post of the year was titled "Last effort for the Offence Seeking Twat of the Year Award" and was about the Top Gear Christmas special outraging literally some people, most of whom were white, middle class Graun readers. Oh, and Andy Choudary.
My doctor was very kind and said there was nothing I can do at this point but see what happens, and that it was not my fault that this had happened. Of course, she obviously doesn't know who she's talking to! I have never in my life taken advice that there is "nothing I can do." I refuse to accept that as a possibility with pretty much everything in life! I had already found someone to do moxibustion a few weeks ago, when she was still transverse before turning head down the first time. I'm going to give that a go later this week. Maybe it will work, maybe it won't, but it's worth a shot. I'm also going to (carefully) try inversions. I had done one right before the baby turned head down last time, so maybe it helped, and maybe it will again. I'm also going to try to just sleep on my left side. I've been switching off at night to stay comfortable, but I'm going to try not to. The way she's positioned, the pressure needs to be on the left side, so perhaps that will help. And of course, I will be scouring the internet for things that sound safe that I can also do.
i wonder if i could just get this and marry myself. ha! anthropolgie... you and your dreamy marketing campaigns. *shakes fist*
ME and the Boss
Frederick concluded by describing writing as an extreme sport. We need to sit in our chairs and write. We must silence our inner critic and recognize that even the most acclaimed authors had their work rejected many times before publication.
I know this brutal live document has some uploads in the blog-sphere already, but this is quite 'different'. The best thing about blogs is enclosed in just one word and that is "communication". I learned MANY things through the years from other people's spaces, had the time to 'correct' and 'sift' things that i had on my mind in a blurry situation and make friends as good as the 'real ones', everyone have in real life. Me and JP are working for quite long on a new WAX CD project. Some things made us hold up the whole 'disquisition' (haha, yeh right!) but in the whole process some sparks got up. Anyway, hopefully in a few days we will be able to present you this new essay. So, partners are made from the same clothe, and in a one way or another sway each-other. And one of my 'influences' on him are my beloved Count Bishops! Jean Philippe started diggin' for records like this one and got up with a Jap version i never had and probably in this cursed country that i live, never find, at least in a reasonable price! The sound on this classic by now LIVE 10" (i know it was out on 12" format also) is raw and at the same time smooth. The way women like their men (right babe?), haha. Along with "Speedball" this is my fave Bishops record. It got me some time to habituate "new" singer, Dave Tice but on this all band members swing and sweat! Gosh, I'm sure these fuckers torched every single bar dared to book them! I wish a video tape resurrect sometime with Bishops doing their thing!
“Book?” – Check!
Kate and Sawyer were loved by scores of fans calling themselves "Skaters," who enjoyed their sizzling chemistry, their similar dark natures and the scandalous trouble they got into together. Kate and Sawyer were the first couple in the triangle to kiss, the first to sleep together, the first to - arguably - say "I love you," and it was all very, very physical, visual, and obvious. In other words, a typical television romance. Not to simplify a complex relationship, because as we know the best "typical" TV relationships are layered like an onion and more complicated than post-structuralism. There was plenty of reason for the Skaters to argue that their couple, as opposed to Jack and Kate, was the "right" one, the "best" one and the one which would ultimately, obviously be confirmed in canon at the end of the show.

“We know that a strong middle class leads a strong economy,” President Obama told reporters in the Rose Garden on Friday, as he used the new census report, which also showed that middle-class income has dipped slightly over the past decade, to continue making his case for limiting the cuts to family incomes under $250,000.

These are the things I have collected so far for Raigan's 2nd birthday themed Down of the Farm.

Then, come term-time, I was back in Cambridge being told that I was not allowed to play Bach on the modern piano - unless I would agree to play it with no dynamics, no pedal at all and a mode of expression only appropriate to a harpsichord. I promise this is not an exaggeration. That was rather a shock to the system, since - as you can well imagine - all I really wanted to do by then was to learn the Goldberg Variations.

Withania somnifera popularly known as Aswagandha is used in several indigenous drug preparations. Administration of a 75% methanolic extract of the plant was found to significantly increase the total WBC count in normal Balb/c mice and reduce the leucopenia induced by sublethal dose of gamma radiation. Treatment with W. somnifera was found to increase the bone marrow cellularity significantly, the percentage increase being 146.3. Treatment with W. somnifera had normalised the ratio of normochromatic erythrocytes and polychromatic erythrocytes in mice after the radiation exposure. Major activity of W. somnifera seemed to be in the stimulation of stem cell proliferation.
The bar should be set up in the rack at your chest height. If you have the bar too high you will have to do a calf raise to get it out of the hooks and if you have it too low you will have to do a quarter Squat to get the bar out of the rack.You want to be able to safely take the bar out and put back in the rack without a struggle or help from others. If you are working in a group it is ideal to re set up for each person. If you have time constraints then make sure your partner is similar in height and set the rack for the shorter person.

My husband has many admirable qualities; he’s intelligent and well versed in a myriad of interesting subjects, he’s well read, he’s hysterically funny, he’s thoughtful and kind and loving and tells me I’m beautiful countless times each day even when I’m quite patently not, like first thing in the morning, or when I’m full of cold or when I’m yelling furiously out the window at whatever has annoyed me at any given time. He’s also a diehard horror fan and zombie expert and you’d want him on your team come the zombocalyse. These are all, indeed, admirable qualities. However, he is also inclined to a certain skittishness that, while endearing, is still slightly less than entirely admirable. My husband is easily startled by certain things, rather like a small bunny on a motorway. In fact, in certain circumstances, I’m essentially married to Shaggy from Scooby Doo.

Their homes and possessions, their livelihoods, their friends and family? Is there anything worse than a mother describing how she lost her grip on her daughter’s hand, to watch her swept away in the waters? Is there anything thicker than the darkness that covers these stoic people with the deep despair of fear of the unknown?

Thousands of people are expected to participate in the walk across the Brooklyn Bridge which will be led by 51 Recovery Delegates representing all fifty states and the District of Columbia. The Delegates, selected from a pool of hundreds of applicants, are local role models chosen to participate because they have been in recovery for more than ten years and are working to help others in their local communities address their addiction. The walk will end at City Hall Park, where a public rally will feature dignitaries from leading non-profit organizations, politicians, celebrities and a special solo musical performance by Rufus Wainwright.
Back to the van... I removed everything, and I mean everything from the van... I even found my favorite lip balm that had gone MIA a while back. How's that for finding the silver lining?

Fast forward five years. I am now out of High School, in college, and Beth is now working at Sheetz. One night I was sitting in my dorm room at college and my phone rang, it was Beth! :) This wasn’t unusual, because we would call each other and talk all of the time. I answered the phone with my usual, “Hey! What’s up?” and was greeted by a panic in her voice that made my blood run cold. Apparently, Beth had been working with a girl at Sheetz that night that told her she had seen a ghost. I listened intently as she described every detail of the story, but there was something oddly familiar about what she was telling me…it was oddly familiar because it was the exact scenario that I had experienced years before. I never told Beth this story (because I knew how scared she would be) and I certainly never told this girl that she was working with this story.

A week ago I was at the Fort Canning Park enjoying a leisurely nature walk in the Park. I saw some visitors with a brochure but the walks can be done on your own – plenty of signboards for guidance.
Although my husband thinks St. Patrick’s Day is all about shamrocks and an excuse to drink, I also think it’s another great holiday that I get to decorate for! I finally have some free time after spending weeks studying for tests for work (more on that in another post) and what do I want to do? Craft, of course!! So today during my lunch break, I went to Michael’s and picked up some supplies. This is what I came up with:
I used the original install disc that came with my iMac. I got the same error through Disk Utility (invalid index key). So I got a copy of Disk Warrior's boot DVD to try and repair it that way. It could look at all the data on the drive, but said the drive had sustained physical damage and could not rebuild the directory. It couldn't even let me get to the files on the drive so I could scoop them up and put what would fit on the external drive.

I was thinking of God's promise that even if we are not the most faithful, and we often doubt Him, that He remains faithful because that is His nature. He is unchanging.
Kidd and Sons of Dartford in Kent was one of a series of breweries bought by Courage in the interwar years. There was the Camden Brewery in1923; Farnham United Breweries in 1927; Noakes in 1930; Kidd and Sons in 1937; Hodgsons Kingston Brewery in 1943. Those names look familiar? They should do. There are odd brewing logs for all of them except for Farnham United Breweries in the London Metropolitan Archives. (The Archives featured in a programme on BBC last night called "Filthy Cities". Unlike me, they let Dan Snow down into the bowels of the building.)
It’s like a cliché: coming to Paris, the fashion capital, to work on one of the most recognizable and successful luxury brands out there. It’s a dream come true. And it’s happening to me. I can't stop wondering why. C’est fou.
Unfortunately, they don’t always have what I want (though they do have a pretty good selection). Or, they have the book in the information and research section, which you can’t take home (for instance, the Journal of John Woolman is there).

The routinization of HIV testing as proposed by H.R. 4470 is necessary if we ever want to stem the tide of this epidemic that shows no signs of slowing. With the incredible new anti-retroviral drugs on the market today, HIV+ people can live better, fuller, longer lives than would have been imaginable even 15 years ago. With ART therapy and a holistic system of care, there’s quite literally no telling how long people can live with this disease. From a strictly biological level, HIV is now another chronic illness like diabetes or Parkinson’s disease. But, as long as we attempt to pigeonhole what at-risk HIV populations look and act like, we perpetuate the stigma that makes HIV so much more painful to deal with mentally and spiritually. We have the medicines and the know-how to treat HIV. We just don’t have the trust needed to do so. Testing everyone is a way that we can show solidarity with the HIV community. It’s time we let the world know that this disease is defined by no one and concerns everyone.

Fearmongering may seem like a good idea at the time, but it can easily backfire and put an entire campaign in jeopardy. It's dishonest, and it's too much trouble.
The plot thickened still further early this evening when The Slog followed up an obscure Wikileaks story relating to the problematic Murdoch-owned social networking website MySpace. Released Assangist documents show that an email from Mike Duffey, Special Agent, Florida Department of Law Enforcement Computer Crime Center, to the ICAC Task Force mailing list, described the ease with which he obtained a suspect’s information from MySpace . By contrast, the technicalities he had trying to get similar information from Yahoo and AT&T when claiming “exigent circumstances” were far more protective of networking privacy.
With that being said.. and myself being quite the strongly opinionated person, I am humbled to say that I have been wrong in many of them… I will admit that I was the person who believed divorce “equals failure rather than solution, that divorce laws encourage if not actually cause divorce and go hand in hand with the secularization of marriage…”
My gem from the Web this week is actually a person – Kersti Anear and especially her FourSquare activity. As I was waiting for a taxi to take us to the airport, she tweeted that she was on her way to London for the weekend too. I have to admit, I took note of her FourSquare check-ins and actually tried some places purely because she had gone there. (Yeah, that doesn’t sound weird or stalker-ish at all…)
With social networking blogs you can create personal blogs or business blogs or a mixture of both. If you are creating a blog for your business it is recommended to have a personal approach so you can develop a connection with other members. When you regularly write on your blog you will find that other members will view your blog and your profile and get a good idea about who you are and what you bring to the community. Members will know what you are about, what your business is about and what you are trying to achieve and they can respond accordingly.
I must admit that almost every week I've had something come up so that I did not eat at home just one time. But I didn't do anything really crazy. When I went to Burger King with mom, I only ate half, and when we went to Outback Steakhouse I ordered the smallest steak and veggies and this tiny thing of seafood and salsa that just didn't look that bad. And on the day of the convention I had something called a Dutch Baby for breakfast, but again I only ate half so it would not be just tons of calories all on the same day.

Private rents have tended to fall in line with rent allowance even though many landlords will not accept rent allowance tenants. The betting on here is that private rents will come under pressure in the short term but it might take a couple of months for the changes to feed through as most renters will have a couple of months to renegotiate their rents or move.

If there's one dish that has faithfully remained on my weekly meal rotation, it's a roasted chicken. For years I feared making my own, usually resorting to the over-cooked and unfortunately dry store-bought rotisserie chickens. It wasn't so much the uneasiness of working with a raw chicken that kept me from roasting myself but rather the superfluous task of trussing. I could never figure it out, and, although I understand that it's aesthetically pleasing, I find that simply tying the legs together is more than efficient. No wrapping, tucking, or twisting; a simple tie around the legs is all you need to keep your bird from "spreading eagle." Or is it "spreading chicken"?

A good part of the enormous income Sturges earned at Paramount was lavished on The Players. The original redesign and reconstruction of the building had been expensive, but out-of-control operating costs along with constant renovations and additions prevented The Players from ever breaking even. In fact, it was such a drain on his finances that Barbara Stanwyck warned Sturges, "That goddamned greasy spoon is ruining you!" The Players reached its zenith during the war years, with restaurants operating on all three levels and a barbershop on the mezzanine. A dinner theater/dance floor featuring a hydraulic revolving stage was installed and eventually even a hamburger stand was added. And there was the long-standing rumor that Sturges had gone to the trouble of building a tunnel beneath Marmont Lane connecting The Players to the Chateau so celebrities could slip away discreetly - for clandestine affairs or simply to avoid the press and/or the police.
John Ives is hiding something, but it's not the whereabouts of his daughter. It is the government-issue computers in the basement... and his past.

Someone with an IQ of 180 and is not afraid to break the law is a valuable asset. With national security at stake, Perkins mobilizes forces to root out the perpetrators before Ives is exposed.

Didn't the right-wingers go on and on about Obama's "death panels" in his Affordable Health Care Act (so-called "Obamacare")? In that plan patients would be able to sit down with a physician and realistically discuss end of life matters, which the pea-brains immediately took to mean that someone would be deciding whether your granny would live or die. (Typical obfuscation of facts, as has been typical of all Republican discussion on Obamacare, until no one, especially their base, knows what the hell the act is even about.) Now Romney is saying in effect, yes, his plan for health care will include death panels because no insurance company would have to cover a client with a pre-existing condition, if he hadn't already been covered. You know that a person in that situation will become a ward of the state; as his ability to pay decreases with sky high medical bills, he will go on state assistance, and we will pay for it. At least if he wants to get coverage he'd have to pay for it, wouldn't he?

We stayed at the Sandpiper again this year, which is an older but well-maintained condo property south of Port A on the Mustang Island beachfront. I like this place for many reasons. The rooms are clean and pleasant, and apparently completely soundproof, which is an important factor when you have children who shriek as loud as our children do when they are together. Most importantly, however, all of the rooms have large balconies that directly face the beach.
Peredur nodded. He stayed as he was and watched the saint expire before his eyes. All the while his angel never took his hand from Peredur’s shoulder.
Now the reason for all this different cost accountancy arithmetic and different ways of measuring cost is simply that each economic process is slightly different and you want to pick a model that reflects what you are doing. For a manufacturing plant, like a brewery, your per pint cost is different if you make a million litres from if you make 2 million litres. If your plant has a capacity of 2 million litres you are likely to be operating at cost efficiency if you are knocking out the full 2 million. Your fixed cost is apportioned over 2 million pints rather than 1 million. However you might only have a market for a million pints. You could also have a market that is split into sectors. Regions of the world, or indeed on or off trade. You will also have a breakeven point. The first half million litres you are selling at a loss because you haven’t covered your fixed costs, and the rest at a profit because from there it is all variable cost. It makes perfect sense, once fixed costs are met to find a market and sell additional product with a price calculation based only on variable cost to reach capacity. That is, we need to sell a million pints at X price to meet our fixed costs, but heh, from there our only cost is commodity grains, so long as we offload it above variable cost, we are quid’s in.
Guess what? It’s summer and I’m back on blogging.
Bull. The ‘art’ argument holds video games up as if it was high art. “Should da Vinci have changed the Mona Lisa if all the people who saw the painting didn’t like it?” That’s arguing apples and oranges, in this lemur’s opinion. Videogames can be art, just like movies and books can be. Heck, I’m traveling down to Washington DC soon to go attend the “Art of Video Games” exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. But does that mean that every movie is high art? Or even pop art? Film buffs might say yes, and then we’d be wading into the waters of the subjective, but really I have to disagree with you if you think that Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is art just the same as Casablanca. I’m generalizing here, but I think most people know there’s a difference between something that is produced for immediate consumption and enjoyment vs. something that was produced to speak to a deeper meaning. We can argue back and forth where the line is, or where individual works fall in that system, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to make that separation.

I don’t know much about jazz so I can’t name any of the pieces played, but to weave through music floating in the air charmed me as I strolled through the Quarter. I watched the musicians but even more, I watched the people who stopped to take pleasure in each performance. I saw smiles. I saw wonder. I saw pleasure. The street musicians know their instruments and delight in delighting their audience and in turn the audience gives back to the musician, not just in tips (tips are appreciated) but in admiration and joy, also.

The Android phones also run on 1GB of RAM, while the iPhone 4S features half that amount. As for storage, all three phones come with 16GB of built-in memory, so you have plenty of space for your apps and media. The Galaxy Nexus and iPhone 4S come in 32GB flavors, too, or even up to 64GB at the high end for the 4S, which doesn’t have a MicroSD card slot for expandable storage. The Droid RAZR also comes with a 16GB MicroSD card included, so the total of bundled storage is bumped to 32GB.

We've lined up a visit to Two Rows to watch some NBA on Thursday and sample some beer at another "Oil & Gas Boys Happy Hour". The golf clubs are going to put to use a few times. I'm emptying out our session beer cabinet in the house to take with me to various house parties. I've already got 1 game night, 1 house party, and a WEEKEND LONG POOL PARTY lined up and ready to go.

So how can we do this all of the time, even while managing our external affairs? It is simple: we manage our external affairs by responding to them with wisdom and virtue. We listen to, contemplate and meditate on the Dharma specifically in terms of how it can be used and applied to the circumstances and challenges of our life, whatever they happen to be. We can do this not only in formal meditation, but as we go about our daily business. Wisdom and virtue is the correct response to every circumstance, both in terms of making us internally happy, but also in the sense of making all of our external activities successful. If we can do this all the time, every moment of our life will be happy, meaningful and bring us one step closer to the final goal.

That is not so, because love is inclusive. It is as inclusive of each one of you, and your star brothers and sisters, and every other being in the outer galaxies and universes you have not even imagined yet. And that we do not perform—can you say, your term would be—“acts of kindness or grace,” that because we do not interfere in your realm—and it is true in many ways, we do not interfere, but—that does not mean that there are not miraculous gifts that descend to each of you and to your planet. That is the first thing.

In a time like this, what would be the perfect beer? If you can find it, Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA. If that's not available, a Stone Brewing IPA would be a great consolation prize. That's exactly what Andy does. He chills out with his bottle of Stone IPA while attempting to speak a little wisdom into Nancy. What's even more impressive about this situation is the huge Moosehead sign glowing on the wall behind them. Yep, Andy just moved a few notches up the cool chart.
I read an interesting fact yesterday, last year in Ireland, gardeners in allotments and at home grew over €9 million worth of fruit and vegetables. Nine million! That’s a staggering amount of produce. That’s 9 million euro not being spent on mass produced, chemically treated food from the supermarket. It’s a very promising figure. I am finding myself more and more interested in growing my own food and buying organic produce, a little effort goes a long way and if we each only grow one successful crop this year, we are still making a difference. I’ll leave you for now with a few photos of the plot the past few days.

Procedure: Heat oil and fry the fish till golden but not fry them too much otherwise they become chewy. Be careful while you fry the fish, it’s better to cover the fish as soon as you slip the fish in the oil. Then after frying the fish keep aside. Now in this oil add the onion paste, ginger and garlic, red chili paste, sugar and salt. Stir and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Then add chopped tomato. Stir and cook till oil oozes out from the masala then add the fish and mix with soft hand. Sprinkle little water if needed ( this preparation don’t need water, it is cooked totally in oil so add very little water to avoid the masala from burning)and green chilly then cover and cook in low flame. When the fish is well cooked sprinkle garam masala powder, drizzle some mustard oil and chopped coriander leaves. Put off the flame and cover and give 5 minutes standing time. Serve with hot steamed rice.
In fact, Mr. Suzuki believes the movement has been going backward for 20 years: “We didn’t sell the right message.” Instead of arguing that environmental responsibility could co-exist with economic growth, he thinks, in effect, that the movement should have argued that we must abandon the quest for economic growth altogether. “We thought if we stop this dam, if we stop this clear-cutting, that’s a great success. But we didn’t deal with the underlying destructiveness, which was the mindset that attacked the forest or wanted to build the dam.” …
The set design of the Opera House is simply marvelous. It’s large and detailed and the opera productions look pretty impressive too. The attention to detail is pretty great. As far as visuals go, the look of Chaney’s Phantom is appropriately gruesome. As mentioned before, Chaney’s makeup techniques allow him a wider range of facial movement than the latex pieces that would become more common in later years for makeup effects. That allows him to give a real performance. The Phantom has had a hard life on account of his deformity (which is greatly elaborated on in the novel). He’s lonely and think he has a kindred spirit in Christine. He’s wrong but haven’t we all been there? True most of us don’t kidnap the objects of our unrequited affection, but we can still relate to the impulse… or have I said too much? All kidding aside, Christine does actually seem rather receptive to his advances until the big unmasking. Then again you can’t expect someone to start a relationship with someone they find physically repellent. The Phantom’s lovelorn psychosis explains why he’s been one of the more romanticized of the Universal Monsters (again, I reference the musical). While singing about love may make for a good play, the horror of a deformed mad man makes for a great classic horror movie.
Thor was better than I expected. His solo movie was the weakest of the lot so far despite awesome Destroyer action, but as part of an ensemble here Chris Hemsworth looks good and seems more mature as a character than in the first movie. But then given the events of that story that makes sense.
How bad, well this is what I saw today at the college I work at. A student came into the restroom to take a dump, he was chewing tobacco and hadn’t brought a cup to spit in. So, he laid down some toilet paper on the floor and proceeded to spit onto the paper while he sat on the toilet. Now that’s not disgusting enough, but after he finished, he got up and left and of course left the tobacco stained paper sitting on the floor. People just suck and it’s time we do something about it. So my hope is that he’ll read this piece and realize it’s about him and embarrass the hell out of him, I know a slim chance, but maybe less slim when I post copies in that restroom.

In 1897 he met the Llewelyn Davies family. The boys, 5 of them, were inspirations for the characters in Peter Pan. He would go for walks in Kensington Gardens and while there he would amuse the boys with stories. The youngest was named Peter, who at the time was a baby. Barrie would tell his older brothers, George and Jack that Peter could fly and that before a baby was born it was a bird. He continued by saying that the windows in nurseries had bars on them so the babies wouldn’t fly away. His most beloved story is about a baby who actually did fly out the window. When the parents of the boys died, Barrie became their guardian.
The evening, at Melbourne’s Wheeler Centre, will also involve Lindy Cameron of Clan Destine Press (which specialises in Australian genre print and ebook publishing) and will be hosted by editor Ann Philpot.
Book Passage
Carpenter matches his disquieting mood with a score that may be pound for pound the best in his career. It’s trademark rhythmic dissonant score that unravels into atonal bleats as the supernatural pressure mounts. At one climatic moment, when the group finds themselves faced with an impenetrable wall of the fog, the score literally falls apart into Carpenter just bashing on the key board. It’s down right avant garde. The film also makes excellent use of it’s Northern California location, an underused environment in film. The pastoral green hills that roll directly down to the shore are a completely different location from the sandy beaches of Southern California. Less touristy, more European. It looks beautiful yes, but as one gazes at the Ocean it leads to one can easily imagine it holding secrets.
There’s no good way to segue into this, but I wanted to mention it anyway. I saw a guy on the train the other day wearing a baseball cap with the word “Inhabitant” printed on it. Well…OK, but as opposed to what? Tourist? Alien? I’m already required to carry my alien registration card at all times. Are we going to be required to wear our residency status on our clothes?
I was consumed by this book and hungry for more, I can't wait to see what happens in the next installment Lucid. 5 out of 5.
Because my blog header has been bugging me for a loooong time, and I hope I was the only who who noticed it was always a little too square, always hanging-off-to-the-left instead of centered, and usually broke the (apparently) #1 rule of "don't blow all your above the fold (the area before you scroll) real estate on it." Oops.
We presently have a global system that many believe to be unsustainable. In other words, our current rate of consumption is outstripping what the environment can sustain long term. We are using the earth’s natural resources more quickly than the earth can replenish them. Moreover, current production methods sometimes result not only in bi-products that harm the environment, but also in products that are used one time and then must be thrown away. This is a waste of resources and it translates into a waste of land because the “one-and-done” products are buried in landfills that entomb trash forever. I believe these (and other) behavioral trends reveal that we believe creation to be something to be abused and exploited rather than nurtured and cared for.
I realized that messes and extra stuff were robbing me of energy and joy. I am still working on this in my house! It is a process and I am getting there. Somehow clutter finds its way into all our homes, and before long it can take over quickly. You will be amazed how once you start purging, how much easier it is to let go.

The national attention from perennial leaders of the black community, Sharpton and Rev Jesse Jackson is not welcome, according to C.L. Bryant, the former head of the NAACP in Garland, Texas.
We don’t hear much from the Obama campaign about the Tea Party movement, but its power must surely concern them. On March 16, 2010 more than a million showed up in Washington to protest against the passage of Obamacare and returned in March 2012 to rally for its repeal. Not since the days of the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War protests has Washington seen such crowds.
The people at the barbeque that day knew that they were in the presence of a great man. A man of courage, and a man of bravery. The rest of the evening was somewhat subdued. It was much quieter than a normal barbeque, and the evening ended much earlier than usual. I think it was because people were somewhat in awe of my Dad’s brave actions, and somewhat humbled by their own fear and panic in the face of the snake.
A week of visitors meant an extended period of eating more than usual. And not that Connie, Nina and I were decadent, not at all. But still, there was wine, cheese and bread on a near-daily basis and other little treats like chocolate and macarons (I had to initiate the young one!).

In today’s fast moving society it is difficult if not impossible to avoid change. Changes challenge our paradigms and tests our flexibility, adaptability and alter the way we think. Changes can make your life difficult and may cause stress but, if it’s inevitable, you must accept it, don’t fight it and in time find ways to improve your life. Try to manage change and try to avoid multiple changes at the same time. If a particular change can’t be avoided welcome it. Change will be with us forever, we must learn to live with it.
In 21 days (not that I’m counting . . .), the wait for The Hunger Games movie will be over! And I, like many others, will be standing in a long line to see it! And, also like many others, my excitement will be tempered by a nagging voice in the back of my head that will be worriedly asking:

According to Chun (2001), Taiwan was already showing all the signs of a “post-nation” by the 1990s: social atomization, disinterest in cultural and kinship affiliation, emergence of the market as the main organizing principle of society, etc. Multicultural/indigenist discourse can do nothing to push Taiwan farther in that direction, but it can do much to reawaken national consciousness. “At a deeper level, both (cosmopolitan) "transnationalism" and (indigenous) "multiculturalism" are in my opinion largely incompatible and mask an imminent future crisis” (Chun, 2001).

Just a real quick note to let my friends and followers know I have been out-of-town and out-of-state pretty much for the last 4 weeks. I even left my images and copics at home just for a little break and "down-time". I've missed some wonderful posting by fellow bloggers. There is no way to catch up on all the commenting on so many awesome creations. I apologize for not leaving comments even though I would sometimes grab a minute or two while away to check sites on my IPhone.
Compiled by S. T. Joshi, a leading authority on Lovecraft’s life and work, this volume sheds unique light on the faint wisps of recognition that Lovecraft received during and just after his lifetime—recognition that would become universal and worldwide with the passing of decades.

I also feel strongly that music should be part of life and not just something that's done in halls full of seats. In pre-TV days people used to play the piano and sing to it. In Elizabethan times people would gather around the table and sing madrigals (the parts were often printed facing "North South East and West" to facilitate this). Being able to make your own music was considered an essential skill, like being able to use a remote control today.
It had been decided before I ever left for Ecuador, that Allison would come and visit me and that we would go traveling. Over the course of the first 8 months, Steven and I began to talk more and more to the point that he decided that he too, wanted to come and visit. Then my friend Julie realized that her friend Scott was living about 4 hours from where I lived, so it was just natural that she would come too.

My grandfather passed away yesterday. And ironically today is his birthday. He would have been 77 years old. Man, was he a great guy! After looking at tons of photos of him throughout the years, I realize what a blessing it has been to have had him as my grandpa. He sure did love his family, with all of his heart! My family and I were praying for a miracle for when he passed away. I also prayed that this miracle would provide a peace that passed all understanding to my grandma, their kids, and our whole family, including my grandfather. God came through, and provided that miracle. Although my grandfather was extremely week, had been sleeping all the time, his breathing was very very slow, and he had what was called "the death rattle" (which is something I hate to even think about or say). He managed to form his hand into the "OK" symbol just before he passed away. My grandfather used to always make this sign with his hand, it was sort of his trade mark. My mom who was there through all of this, said that it must have taking him extreme effort to be able to do that. He had no more strength left. Some how just before he had passed, he managed to let everyone know that he was going to be ok.

Without question, this is a must read for the follower of Jesus who longs to see the Church reach it’s fingers deep into the heart of God. It’s for those frustrated with the status quo of church life and who long to see something of Kingdom significance happen in their midst. It’s for those who can no longer sit still in their pew for their soul groans and aches too loudly to ignore and they must set their feet to the streets to rub up against those in need of Jesus.
Despite the contractions being one on top of the other I was still thinking the contractions were short and that it would still be a few hours before I would need to start pushing. I just kept waiting for the contractions to get longer, but they never did! I was on my hands and knees and I started crying to Steven “I can’t do this again. I’m scared. I’m going to tear. I won’t be able to push the baby out!” I think this only lasted for maybe a couple of minutes. It was the world’s shortest transition. Steven was saying “it’s alright, you can do this”, I think he was getting a bit frightened by this stage. Then it got all too much and I couldn’t talk any more.

I'm tired. A lot of the things we do are things that revive my soul or refresh my spirit. This past weekend was a solitary little island of downtime where Jeff took the opportunity to try and turn me into a gamer (more on that another time). It was a nice weekend of time at home where we truly ignored our responsibilities and just did a lot of vegging out.

Our coupon came with a Mezze platter to share, a family pizza, two desserts and tea or coffee, however you would have to be extremely hungry to get through that as the servings at Ciao are very generous. We started with the Mezze platter and told them to hold the smoked salmon and neither of us are fans, instead they filled the platter with other delights including dolma, marinated vegetables, pizza bread, hummus, meat balls and Greek salad. Next came a family size meat lovers pizza with BBQ and chilli, there is no way the two of us could have finished the pizza it was so huge and full of toppings! So with a third of a pizza left they packed it up for us to take home, which made my partner very happy as he thought that taking it to work for lunch would be the perfect way to easy back into the working week. During the meal our daughter was dropped at the restaurant and upon seeing this the waitress quietly came over and offered to bring her a scoop of icecream with topping. Now if you are a parent this is the moment that a restaurant becomes family friendly so with a big smile I gratefully accepted.
So, what has happened in the intervening years? How did I turn from a teenager who could lap that up to an adult who couldn't keep her eyes on the page? But forget me - what about you? I'm guessing I'm not the only reader whose reading habits have changed. And it can't be to do with age, because surely a teenager would have if anything a greater need for pace than a middle-aged person? Are we just too busy nowadays to read slowly? Have we been subconsciously demanding faster books / simpler sentences over the last thirty years, so that now page-turnability is compulsory, whereas before (?) it wasn't? Has our definition of page-turnability changed?
So I was watching and the story progressed, and they ended up in the "Bach Building", which is where Arthur's family wealth is tied up (his full name is Arthur Bach, you see). What does one spy also on the wall of the building? Oh nothing except the Bank of Ireland name and logo. Admittedly, it's not as bad as seeing an Anglo or even AIB logo but it's still funny to wonder how fucked he and his wealth would be if he was around today in general. I'm speaking the character of Arthur of course, not Dudly Moore, because Dudly Moore is dead.

Actually, of course, he is an early music specialist in the most visceral way: the dusty historical tomes we all read to try and understand the music making of the 17th and 18th centuries are chock full of anecdotes about emotional playing, mind-boggling ornamentation, extraordinary use of colour, and phrasing. That’s Pandolfo.

She breaks down in tears. After scolding her, you turn to your spouse and criticize her for placing the cup too close to the edge of the table. A short verbal battle follows. You storm upstairs and change your shirt. Back downstairs, you find your daughter has been too busy crying to finish breakfast and get ready for school. She misses the bus. Your spouse must leave immediately for work.

I have never met Cassidy Megan, who was nine when she started Purple Day in 2008, but as I’ve read more about her I’ve come to feel like I know her a little bit. She is very much like how I imagine Traci to have been at that age: plucky, self-assured, confident, and caring. Traci’s accomplishments were in sport, specifically bowling (she was Nova Scotia’s first national junior bowling champion) and table tennis (a national doubles award and numerous Atlantic awards); she became a coach and went on to achieve Level 4 national certification, the second-highest level in coaching.

McQueen was keen to do all his own stunts, and was only stopped on occasions by his insurers. He did almost all of the bike work in The Great Escape (apart from 'that' leap... which he really wanted to do!), and the legendary car chase in Bullitt (bar just a couple of stunts). In fact, he even dressed as a German to carry out other stunt work in The Great Escape, as the makers were having so much trouble finding stuntmen who were as good as him.
It turned out that this priest was there that day to drum up interest in the Passionist Family Group Movement, which he had begun about 20-odd years ago. The idea is that families with obvious similarities are grouped into a “family group”, a purely social thing where you get together once a month. There are usually about 7 to 10 families in a group, and allowing for those that don’t “click” for whatever reason, you generally get about 6 families that turn up almost every month.

At one time or another, we have all uttered the phrase “it’s not fair” to someone in our life. Right now we live in a country where that cry resonates among the common individual. “It’s not fair” has been applied to health care costs, the unbridled criminal activity of our financial institutions and the tax code. We all know the story by now of how Warren Buffet’s secretary is taxed at a higher rate than Mr. Buffett. Is this fair?

When you understand your choices from Creator’s truth and perspective, right and wrong are non-issues. One of the most helpful things you can do for yourself is to forgive yourself unconditionally. When you trace back the origin of each choice you no longer would choose, you will find fear. When you are able to see your actions (and the actions of others) from this perspective, it opens the pathway to compassion and forgiveness automatically. When you also have Creator show you how the choice served you (and others, potentially), you then open the pathway to full release and clearing.

*Our church...we love. But with Ross as an elder, things can get a little overwhelming sometimes. People are messy and broken and have all kinds of problems. It's our calling and life's work to walk with people through all that. But thankfully our church also recognizes that the leaders need rest and give accordingly. So many pastors burn out and even walk away from the Lord because it can just get to be too much. Praise the Lord that our church protects and cares for the leaders enough to give them a paid sabbatical!
So where do we go from here? WoW has been amazingly successful at attracting people who have no background in older games like Diablo, instead often coming from free-to-play or casual games. Each of these new players has decided to spend $15 per month on a game (including those stepping up from free-to-play WoW), and as gamers, we want to welcome them. But as gamers, we also know that bringing new people into the nascent gaming culture isn’t a mere matter of having them pay money to Blizzard: what we want is for former nongamers to care about games, experience gaming moments like many that we’ve described here, and move on to other games once they’re done with WoW. If WoW walked the middle ground between the Diablo player’s experience and the FarmVille player’s comfort zone, it might be able to accomplish this, thus truly enriching the gaming community. But moving WoW all the way to the latter end of that spectrum is the easy way out, achieving nothing in the long run. WoW gets the immediate rush of players, but those new subscribers haven’t actually made any lasting jump into the world of games. WoW got their immediate business by compromising whatever was necessary to do so, and we’ve all come along for the ride.

“I would go to bed at night and wake up in a cold sweat but I did not know why. “My heart was racing and I found it difficult to breathe. I was feeling awful! It came to the point where I was afraid to go to bed; yet I had to go earlier because I was extremely exhausted. I would go to bed right after supper and fall asleep immediately, only to wake up sweaty, scared, and anxious. That was how my illness first manifested itself.”

Such dilemmas get their name from the notion that they are so unsettling that they “diorient” you from your worldview. They are important in teaching critical thinking in that they tend to be a highly effective way in which to encourage the four-stage process outlined above. Strictly speaking, they need not always be dilemmas since that term connotes a decision-making problem in which there are two possible courses of action. They could be trilemmas, or quadrilemmas or whatever. In the case of cryogenics there is a dilemma to contend with: should you freeze yourself or not? (We'll talk about the precise nature of that dilemma in more detail in the first proper entry of the series).

Oh, gents. Good thing the ladies have it together.

During the IATEFL Learner Autonomy Pre-Conference Event, I met Robert Moncrief. He is currently doing a PhD investigating people’s ideas regarding and attitudes to obscene/offensive language use in English.

If you have a few minutes and want to help him out, could you complete his survey.

That's a crystal AB Swarovski bicone on the left - it's a bit hard to see what it is. The rest is made of garnet chips from my local bead store. I liked the garnet with the focal better than more neutral colors. I felt like it really let the focal shine.
Like all muffins they were quick and easy to make and I have since adapted the recipe for other fruits with great success. The only thing I haven’t done so far is to make them using Splenda !! (Sorry, Antony!!)
In my humble opinion, this country is really at a crossroads and I truly believe that when you peel all the labels off the people living here, there are primarily just two kind of folks... those who want to take care of themselves and those who want someone to take care of them. You might say those who want to take responsibility for themselves and those who want someone to be responsible for them.

Even the highest fifth (top 20%) has averaged less than what had previously been average GPA growth rate over the prior 40 years of a little over 3%. And the bottom half of the top 20% did poorly, because the top 1% did so well that it raised the average for the top 20%. That means that over the past 30 years only people roughly within the top 10% were able to realize any growth in real income.

Foods that are rich in starchy, high-glycemic carbohydrates may also promote better sleep, as they help to stimulate the release of insulin and tryptophan and cause these sleep-inducing substances to enter the brain. According to a study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, carbohydrates that are on the high end of the glycemic index scale, meaning they increase the body’s sugar levels rapidly, encourage sleep when eaten at least four hours before bedtime. Foods such as Jasmine rice, potatoes, carrots, corn, puffed cereal, and honey are some of the healthiest choices of simple carbohydrates.
My friends tell me all the time that I should basically suck it up and complete a Bachelors degree anyways, which is probably what I should do, but seeing what debt does to people and reading student loan horror stories is a good prevention method! Though I am realizing that many employers want that degree, along with 5-10 years of experience. I know that I don’t want a series of jobs that pay less than $10 per hour; hell, the highest paying job you can get where I live besides working for the county or district is at the manufacturing plants, which pay $10.50 per hour and sometimes a little bit over that. I don’t want that. I want to be able to afford a house one day, with a lot of land.

Today was kind of a lazy day. I slept in for the first time in a while which was really nice. I spent some of my day cleaning up my computer, deleting junk and making more space on it. I did some studying and I spent some time cleaning out the kitchen. We are in need of weeding out the entire house and we have both agreed that the kitchen is where we will start and I did that while my husband hauled off brush today.
I am a slow reader and when I was told this had to go back soon I decided to give it a read because at only 134 pages it wouldn't take me over a couple of days to read it. How wrong I was. The story starts with Spider perched on a roof wanting to end his life. It has all gone wrong. There is nothing left. Best to end it. Chapter 2 cuts back to the 'why' and we follow Spider on his last run. The action on the run is graphically explained and tense throughout until the run comes to an abrupt end and we dragged through the consequences and repercussions.

I find his entry very intriguing because historically America’s best marathoners have come from the ranks of 10000 meter runners. Guys like Bill Rodgers, Frank Shorter, and Rupp’s coach Alberto Salazar, were all 10000 meter runners who moved up to the marathon with tremendous success. That pattern holds true internationally as well, as runners like previous marathon WR setters Paul Tergat and Haile Gebrsellassie moved up to the marathon after stunning careers over 10,000 meters.

Maybe it’s because I don’t like people telling me what to do, which is ironic, considering how much self-help literature I’ve consumed in my life. Anyway, have any of you read this book?

Just a little snippet of my new cape the lovely people at BestBritishBloggers and Joe Browns sent me earlier this week!

Online dating sites have the same problem. Because the people who use these websites have never met, they can’t assess the variables that are most predictive of long relationships, such as conversational habits and problem-solving tendencies. (The scientists note that these variables still require people to interact in the flesh; no online quiz can measure them.)

4. The RSPO DOES NOT provide a credible means of verifying that palm oil is being sourced responsibly. Responsibility for certification is passed onto to external bodies that are easily influenced by vested interests and corruption. Worse still, the RSPO allows certified sustainable palm oil to be mixed with oil from other sources, making a mockery of the entire system.

I thought this was such a great idea as well - duraseal is not very eco-friendly but having seen how school books get treated it does appeal to keep the books in tact and waterproof! (I used to teach kids who had books covered in wallpaper which looked really great but didn't last long- it would end up ripped and tattered really quickly.) And I loved the idea of designing covers with her name and colours and pictures that I knew Amelie would like.
Something I’d like to add to my last point. There are direct mail opponents (they call it ”junk mail”) that insist we should use less paper because it kills trees. But in reality, in this country as well as others, paper made from “virgin” wood typically comes from a renewable forest resource. Once a tree grows to a certain maturity, it ceases to emit oxygen and begins to release the carbon dioxide it had been storing over the years. These are the trees the renewable forestry industry remove, use for creating paper, and replace with new trees. If you’re looking to fight the good fight for trees, it’s not the paper companies you should be after.

It now transpires that the F-duct rear wing on the W01 in China was passive device. There remains the development of the ducting towards the cockpit and a tip-off suggests this is tied to a reshape of the roll structure. How the ducting then reaches the rear wing may be either via a shark fin or up through the rear wing support. Although Brawn tested a sharkfin briefly in 2009 on the BGP001, the team have yet to race a version of it, making them somewhat behind the times and lacking experience in how the taller bodywork reacts on track.
Writers Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot turn in another pretty OK script that’s commendably less frenetic, complicated and CGI-driven than the last one, but you’ve pretty much seen it all before and this exists purely to keep the franchise current with all its associated theme park rides and merchandise (coming soon to Wii Fit: Pilates of the Caribbean!!!). 7/10

I decided to try twisting some Southern California vintage (Burnt orange raglan), beach (Sandy colored Maverick shorts), and skater (70's Levi's corduroy shirt) motifs. It's surprising how some small adjustments can make a familiar outfit make you go "huh?", like by coiling some braided leather around your waist. I gotta divulge to you guys that I was looking through the entire Balenciaga archive and thinking about classic aviation at the time of styling this too. Again, what makes sense to me is something you guys might be able to see, too?

Of all the time that I spend with kids, I would say that maybe 5% of our time is spent watching television or playing video games. And I only say 5% because it’s a nice sounding number…it’s probably less than that. More often we are at the park, doing crafts, playing barbies, writing stories, dancing, singing, reading books or baking things in the kitchen. I rarely have the kids play by themselves and do something on my own (which some babysitters evidently think is alright?) If they have friends over or have made a new friend at the park, I will back off so they can play on their own, but I never make them play alone.

Nick Griffin was unfairly attacked on TV recently by the deeply unattractive Jabba the Gaunt, when he referred to a “Chocolate coloured sameness” Gaunt's implication being that the term was, in itself, racist, but how can it be when what Griffin described is no more than the obvious and and inevitable result of the sort of racial and cultural mixing so beloved by our opponents?.

Not a single leader of this country since 1994 was a patriot, they all lived in luxury abroad for decades and came back to this country still thinking it was as it was when they had left in the early 1960's. They did not come back to build and grow SA, they came here to collect, like any and every other revolutionary movement in the history of the world.

On last Saturday, they suddenly announced that they were here in UK visiting their parents and that they would like to come and visit me an hour before they got on their train. Of course, I was panic stricken as I was totally unprepared and I haven’t seen them for over 10 years and I was a bit annoyed that my weekend routine and errands would have to be postponed. Anyway, we went to a little Bistro restaurant around the corner of my street because that was the only place I knew we could go without an advanced booking.

But this story as fanciful as it is; as flawed as it was with Martin asking me to marry him before he was divorced. Today he held in his hand the letter from the solicitor which agreed to all the terms. He signed on the dotted line and sent it on in the post the same day. In 6 weeks from the filing date he will be single. And free to marry. If he chooses to. My bets are on him not being single for long.

Around this time last year, my daughter and I drove around one of my old neighborhoods on our way to meet my sister at my mother's grave. The neighborhood had changed drastically, yet the main structures were still there - the house where I spent my teenage years and the high school which I attended. Both the house and the high school shared the same wrought iron fence and it didn't matter that I was the student that lived closest to the school - literally right next door - I was always late, only getting up when I heard the school's morning bell go off.

Following his divorce Bukowski resumed drinking and continued writing poetry.

We got some dreadful news last week. Malcolm McDonald played bass in the first lineup of the Primevals, and returned to play guitar for much of the band's time. He left at the tail end of last year. His son, Robbie, was killed in a hit & run accident on Monday night,while cycling. Robbie was a lovely young man, only 22. My heart goes out to Malcolm and all his family. The funeral is on Thursday. We'll be there. I haven't spoken to Malc in a while, the way that you don't always talk to some of your oldest and dearest friends because you know you'll always be able to pick up again where you left off. Yeah, that.

In addition, the recipe said to only spread the graham cracker crust on the bottom of the springform pan, but for some reason I decided to pack some onto the sides of the pan too. I'm not sure why I did it but I regret it, because when I unmolded the cheesecake the sides were really ugly, craggly and uneven. (I'm not even going to include a picture of the unmolded cheesecake, I'm too embarrassed!)
The point about measurable effects may be the most important, however. Not fitting in with our current theories needn’t be an absolute barrier. There was a time when we didn’t have a clue what a neutrino was, but they were still out there doing their thing all the while, and eventually we noticed them. And because we kept noticing them, and they always cropped up in the same circumstances and behaved in the same way, we couldn’t ignore them. And if there’s some qi flowing through everyone which has any rules to its existence at all, we should be able to notice it. If it’s there.

As a note in the church explains, Spike’s headstone has recently been removed by his family for re-engraving following the recent death of his wife Shelagh, which means I won’t be able to read for myself his self-penned epitaph ‘Dúirt mé leat go raibh mé breoite’ (‘I told you I was ill’), written in Gaelic as a compromise to avoid any perceived offence. A brilliant comic to the last. But, using the clues of other headstones show on the postcard, I am soon able to find his grave: a low mound of fresh earth, a solitary jam-jar of dead flowers pushed into the loose soil, beneath an ash tree, in the most tranquil spot in the graveyard. An appropriately peaceful spot for someone who found life troubling at times, tormented as he was by mental illness, despite his success, for many of his years. Rest in peace dear Spike, and thank you for all the laughs.

2) She likes you, a lot. This girl has some real feelings for you, and this is her way of showing it. It’s a very unselfish gesture, knowing that you would reap all the benefits while she intakes the dead babies and unwanted calories (approx 7 calories/teaspoon). With this girl, all you need to do is ask for her to swallow. She wants to please you, so tell her how you can be pleased. How to spot her: When she spends more and more time with mouth-to-cock, next time leave a paper towel next to the bed. The challenge for her is the swallowing part, not the cum-in-mouth part, so give her an “out” with a handy dandy towel.

What's so great about The Juana Run, held every March at Palo Alto's Juana Briones Elementary School? Maybe it's so great because it's such a modest community race, with a small time feel but plenty of great competition that's effortlessly well organized. There was a time when my favorite race was Wharf to Wharf, a super-intense six miler of 15,000 runners with a world class field clawing and scratching through the laid back coastal town of Santa Cruz each July, or the Dammit Run, a crazy 5-miler in Los Gatos in August that starts on a track crammed with 1,000 runners that leads to a gentle running trail for about a mile before you hit then three diabolical hills in rapid succession, each tougher than the last, before two miles of roller coaster down hills to the finish.

The mistake, the disconnect between 1960s Black Liberation Theology and Lisa Miller’s wistful and overreaching resurrection of Black Liberation Theology fifty years later, is precisely captured in Obery Hendricks’ insistence that political conservatives who call themselves Christians but oppose government programs that help the poor are not, in any meaningful way, Christians.
Wiffiti seems to have gone wild (see email below) this month! We (Lisa Nielsen/Willyn Webb) were panicked that we would no longer be able to use a great cell phone tool. Having students (and staff) text into Wiffiti boards has made many classes and meetings more fun, more productive, and enhanced learning. However, after emailing LocaModa and calming down a little, there are ways that educators can still utilize Wiffiti by having students text in their responses to questions, their ideas during a brainstorm, reflective thoughts, questions, and comments IF they have an email
This next one by far is the most valuable piece of advice there is I think when talking to girls. Do: Make her laugh. Laughing is as universal as breathing. Humor is an excellent way to lighten the mood and it’s a great icebreaker which brings me to the next point. If you where words on the page, you’ll be fine print. Do: use cheesy pick-up lines. Not because they’re clever or flattering but because they are hilarious in their absolute absurdity. Listen, I’m saying pick-up lines have their place so use them appropriately. And finally, Do: Take a hint. Approaching girls is a numbers game and sure there are things you can do to affect those numbers but you will strike out a time or two.

The leaders of the church are blatant fools if they think their beloved churchian girls are going to fight for Jesus. Hell, I will go further and say western civilization in itself will fall due to society’s belief in women.

That is the nature of women, a man who resists her attempts to control him will make her submit to him.

So why are humans cursed with the power to distract yourself from the task at hand by anything that seems a little more fun? Well, over the last three years I have begun to realise the cause, if not just for myself but for many others. It is the fear of starting! It is that irritating feeling of guilt and sickness that strikes first thing in the morning and continues until you convince yourself that losing a day wouldn’t hurt and you still have ages. Now this feeling is easy enough to combat when writing an essay. Once you have the first couple of hundred words down it seems a lot easier to address the problem of completing the essay; just keep making valid points, supporting them and hopefully answer the question until you get within conclusion range of the word count. But revision is a completely different. It is not a pile of washing up that moves from the dirty pile, through the water and onto the drying wrack, there is no concrete end to the task! How can you know when you have revised everything? At what point do you decide your mind now contains enough knowledge to walk into your exam and gain the highest possible mark you can? The answer is, you don’t. Anyone who has ever felt the gnawing pang of pre exam nerves will know that there is always one, I’m trying to think of a nice way to put this, genius who turns to you moments before you walk in and says something along the lines of “hey, did you revise blah blah?”

This jelly is pretty simple to prepare. What needs to prepare is the green bean aka mung bean before hand. Just boil the cleaned mung bean with water and salt until it is really soft and almost dry. Either mash or blend the bean but I just mash them with a spoon.

You need to understand that they are part of the Cabal. I tell you, you are each responsible for yourself. The Cabal’s plans to destroy the lives of so many of you are now in the public domain. Are you going to sit by and do nothing to prevent such atrocities?

These are a little hard to part with too . . . but, I'd love to see them go to a new home . . . and be part of new celebrations each holiday season. Like my other two arm chairs, these used to be upholstered in a somber black leather with tweed backs. Until two years ago . . . when the house practically exploded with colour for the Rue Magazine shoot. I could see these as part of a beautiful entry way, maybe flanking an antique console . . .

When her mother takes a turn for the worse and the whispers grow too strong for Alyssa to bear, she seeks the origins of their family curse. A set of heirlooms and a moth tied to an unusual website lead Alyssa and her gorgeous best friend / secret crush, Jeb, down the rabbit hole into the real Wonderland, a place more twisted and eerie than Lewis Carroll ever let on.

For what turns out to be a complex yet subtly orchestrated sequence shot, the titles lead into a long opening take lasting several minutes to introduce us to ‘Laure’ (Rebecca Romjin), though we never see her except from behind, and her partner in crime (the amazing Eriq Ebouaney who in the film is only ever known as ‘Black Tie’). Using coded language, they are planning a complex diamond robbery, though it is also clear that theirs is an ‘uneasy’ relationship after he slaps her and takes off with her passport. Eventually her face is revealed (from behind a camera, of course) as she and two others get in position to make off with a ridiculous diamond-encrusted gold bustier being worn by a starlet at the Festival. Laure distracts the girl when she goes to the ladies room, while her two partners set up a power failure to get away under the cover of darkness. But there are the inevitable betrayals as, to the strains of Ryuichi Sakamoto’s lush rendition of Ravel’s ‘Bolero’ (referred to on the soundtrack as ‘Boleroish’), Laure makes off with the goods and Black Tie is shot and arrested. She flees to Paris looking to get a new passport, dons a black wig and attracts the unwelcome attention of Antonio Banderas’ paparazzo before being tracked down by one of her ex-confederates, who throws her off the balcony of the hotel where she has been hiding out. Miraculously she lands on something soft and even more miraculously, she is mistaken for a woman who looks just like her and whisked away by a middle aged couple and taken to a house so she can sleep things off.

Markas is my sweet, stubborn, bull headed, mama's boy. He and I have been known to have 45 min. stand-offs. Guess he doesn't realize yet that he comes by that stubborn streak honestly(and I've got a lot more practice). If this is any indication of the teen age years I may just run away from home. He is my cuddle bug. He will lay in bed with for an hour after I get home from work in the mornings just so we can cuddle. He is my tiny boy compared to his brother and sister. He is always there at their side if they are hurt or sick. He would rather stay home with mama than go anywhere without me. However, his brother is the most vocal about his displeasure of me leaving for work every evening.
People suspected of being criminals will not be assumed innocent until proven guilty. A sad state of affairs, especially if you consider that the man who is making these statements fought tooth and nail for his right to be assumed innocent in both his rape and corruption cases.

This uses a couple newer products... the first one is: Del Maguey Vida de San Luis del Rio with smoky aromas of pear, blossoms, lychee, honey, vanilla and roasted agave that are sumptuous and clean. The flavors follow suit and grow to include ginger, mandarin, cinnamon, laurel and plantain buttressed by delicate smoke. The finish fades with citrus, minerals and sandalwood; this mezcal is nonpareil.

On Fridays Mum would give me the two half crowns wrapped in a bit of paper and the receipt to go to the shop on a corner in the Lambeth Walk. I collected the bundle wrapped in a white cotton cloth with a very big pin in the fabric to keep it closed. We had our clean clothes for Mass, altho my sleeves got very short (mum said I was growing too quickly) and we did have to keep them very nice. Sunday night the bundle was placed on the chair in the kitchen near the door so that I could not forget to take it with me in the morning on the way to school. Harvey and Thompson the pawnbroker did not open til 9.

What does seem to be a matter of confusion is the revised deadline for the final payment. BrewDog says they had 'til last Friday per an email from Marc, but the plug was pulled the day before. This hasn't been rebutted convincingly by Marc and Camra. Cue uproar with the Brewdoggies spitting venom over Marc and some Camra stooge called Graeme Gander, and a general monstering of Camra.

Me: L: “with your dismissal of a claim, you’re replacing it with another claim of your own.” No, I am not. If someone came up to you and claimed that chocolate made you into a giant, you could easily dismiss that claim without having to present any evidence, because they have provided no evidence whatsoever in favour of their claim. Even if chocolate could make you into a giant, they haven’t presented any evidence, so there is no point in seriously considering their claim until they have done so. I am dismissing a claim, which in it of itself is NOT making a claim. What you are spouting is nonsense.

What this means too is that religion can never go back. There is no primal religion, no Ur-language spoken, no pretending that it is still the “Word,” even when reading it on a Kindle. No, it has all changed. It’s all new. And renewing. “Understanding media” means also “understanding religion.”

The Corruptible begins with Ray Quinn, an ex-cop, private investigator working on a case with his sidekick, Crevis. They team up and work on cases along side the police, which Ray has very good connections with. Ray deals with an internal battle everyday due to being shot while on the job and is masked by his friend, Jim (alcohol). While struggling to do his job with the pain, Ray lands a case that sets him in a tornado of events throughout the book. The events were well thought out and keeps the reader guessing.

Thus we can be sure that the whole world, with the exception of those who are presently saved (the elect), are under the judgment of God, and will be annihilated together with the whole physical world on October 21, 2011, on the last day of the present five months period. On that day the true believers (the elect) will be raptured.

Conte was similarly swift in dropping his commitment to the 4-2-4 which had served him so well thus far in his managerial career. He had expressed reservations to the board about the signing of Pirlo specifically because the player did not fit the holding midfielder mould required for such a formation, but rather than force square pegs into round holes, he subsequently adjusted his approach. By developing different variations on 4-3-3 and then later 3-5-2 he was able to not only get the best out of his squad but give himself different options to combat varied opponents.
So, the reasoning behind this title is to leave out the end result assumed by the hierarchy/state/powers-that-be in such a scenario and open the question, central to my other project, of how we could/might really interact if the technological/industrial state government’s progress (“the economy”!) weren’t our reason for decision making. Sure, we have disputes among ourselves. Violence is part of our nature, if only in self-preservation, as some have argued (though I will disagree with this as a widespread generlization for various reasons I won’t develop here). However, the assumptions about mass-scale violent tendencies are too often unquestioned (we don’t merely push buttons to annihilate those unlike us because we want a whopper they have, there’s far more to it) and the possibilities and realities of our own interactions (and our less-fucked futures?) are drowned in a sea of weakly argued truisms based aphorisms from shitty, old, white-male philosophers.

So what can you do? Listen, I know as much as anyone that stress is unavoidable for most people in today’s world, but there are things you can do to minimize the effects. Disconnecting yourself from your cell phone, and computer when you get home is one way. Another would be to make it a point to have some “me” time at least for a half an hour a day. Whether that’s watching t.v., reading a book, exercising, taking a walk, or meditating, it’s important for your mental and physical health. I personally find myself wanting to find things to do even in down periods of time. I almost never want to sit and just relax but when I realize what I’m doing to myself, I remember that it’s ok to disconnect and just relax for a bit.

It is hypocritical in extremis to support Jewry whilst maintaining a contrary position regarding Islam, or to lay claim to the moniker nationalist whilst supporting Israel, as she systematically slaughters a civilian population, all this and more contemporary nationalism advocates, I cannot and will not be a part of that. I believe that the Jewish question is as pertinent now as it has ever been, I take the position that no non-European group should dictate European affairs, why we lament the rise of Islamic political power whilst we are too frightened to mention the Jewish lobby, we complain incessantly about Islamic fraud within the political system whilst never contesting the immense influencing, on both a national and international stage, Jewry commits, so why one and not the other, have we really lost our principles to the extent that we will forego one evil and simply attack another because it is fashionable and is therefore an easier target. If that is the case then we are not nationalists, merely moulded by exterior forces, as has proved to be the case over this issue, at one time I heard, “why it’ll destroy the party if we contest this thing”, destroy the party, the party, is the party more important now than truth, reason or indeed the besieged white peoples of Europe.

Do you think the description in verses 14-22 still holds true for God? Yes, for those who share the love. For his followers? We are expected to love Him because He is our creator and Father. How so? One way to reflect it is to love His other children and obey Him.

Pelosi etal claim that this will level the playing field by cutting out special interest groups and those evil corporations (as referred to by the Left) who will be given a special advantage when they give money to political candidates.

The Democrat Socialist Party always point to the corporations as ones who are influencing the out comes of elections however in fact it is big money given by George Soros to groups like Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Politico, and many other groups far out spend conservative money. Now that we conservatives have learned how to play by their rules the Left is having a hissy fit.
