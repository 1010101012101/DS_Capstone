The Acid Test Reels 1965-1967
Subsequently, one of OCP's executives, Morton (Miguel Ferrer), takes advantage of the situation and uses Murphy's corpse as a component for a new crimefighting tool called... oh, you know what its name is, so let's move on. A by-product of this latest creation is that RoboCop/Murphy retains memories of his human existence and having been murdered by a gang of thugs headed up by vile thug Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Hunting down his murderers now becomes part of his directives as he tracks down every person responsible, leading him to a cover-up deep inside OCP that may involve an executive (Ronny Cox) who knows more than he's been letting on.
may all my days during my 33rd year be as happy as this one.
Okay, I think it is only right that I start with a confession…..you know the Zumba DVD I was going to do yesterday? I didn’t do it…… Wait! Don’t give up on me already! It is okay, even I don’t feel that guilty about it. You know what it is like having that inner conversation with your mind, giving yourself excuses and promising to do it tomorrow? Well I am trying to break that cycle. I am not disappointed in myself because that will add to the cycle of making excuses, moaning to myself, feeling guilty, maybe reaching for some cake, and then there is no point exercising today because I ate cake……I am sure lots of people know what I mean!

As a cashier at a grocery store, I am required to stand in one spot for eight hours a day, with two breaks and a lunch. I finally got around to telling my boss about it a few months after working there, because I’d started getting sicker. I’m very lucky because she was incredibly understanding, but I’m willing to give myself some credit here, too, because I didn’t lead with: “Well for starters, I have to poop a lot.” Instead, I helped her understand by saying, “Ever heard of lupus?”
Usually our weekends are slow-paced and relaxing … this past weekend was anything but slow-paced and relaxing. And while it was a fun weekend and we had a good time, I have to confess that I’m glad to get back into our normal routine.
Leclerc himself died of yellow fever later in 1802 but the death knell of white-run San Domingo was the outbreak in May 1803 of another war with Britain. The British blockaded the island and supported the blacks and mulattos in what was now open race war against the French. In November 1803 the French surrendered and sailed away, leaving San Domingo in the hands of Jean-Jacques Dessalines (1758-1806), a former slave who had been one of L’Ouverture’s generals. It is this combination of yellow fever and support from the British that accounts for the Afrocentric claim that a black army “defeated” Napoleon.

Whisk the sugar and egg yolks together in a bowl and then add to the hot cream, stirring constantly. Return the pan to a low heat and stir until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and add the dark chocolate and orange zest. Stir until smooth. Fill the glasses with the cream and refrigerate for at least two hours or preferably overnight.

Currently Hungary is the symbol of resistance in Europe. Hungary has demonstrated that they will not lose the freedom they gained from the Soviet Union to a better masked, yet not less oppressive empire. On January 21, 2012, four hundred thousand Hungarians marched in a “Peace Train” to assert their patriotism and support their government and constitution.

lo's three dogs were all very healthy and lean and beautiful, with shiny hair and lots of energy. especially sara (see picture). the secret, lo said, was in the diet. sara stayed with us from time to time when lo and her husband were out of town, and lo brought over prepackaged individual meals that she had made for sara. toby and boscoe got bowls of dry kibble. sara dined on raw chicken livers and raw turkey necks and chicken wings and wonderfully fragrant ground-up vegetables, so fresh-smelling that i wanted to eat them myself, and mysterious powders and pills and sometimes a nice dollop of organic canned pumpkin for dessert.
You’ll be fine.
As promised, here I am with news of the Craft it Forward I mentioned.

After all the parties, food, and entertainment I am ready for a vacation! But life has to go on... I just have to share a few pics, McGuire is into this new superhero pose or battle pose. I absolutely ADORE it! It just shows to me if there is ever a "super villian robot, dinosaur or scary eyes" McGuire will rescue me! :)
Good thing for Scott Walker that God is on his side and has bigger plans for him, because there are a lot of corporations on welfare that need Scott Walker.
Matt got back yesterday from his five day hunting trip. He stayed at a hunting lodge four hours outside of BA. He was invited by his friend from Memphis to join him the other fifteen others on the expedition. Seeing that Matt dreams about shooting fish almost every night and his most searched topic in youtube is 'spearfishing', this was a good alternative. I was a little surprised when he told me they were hunting doves but apparently doves are pests to farmers. Over five days, the group shot over 53,000 doves! Matt had never used a shotgun before but he did pretty well in the group, placing second for accuracy.
It reminds them of the place they met or a vacation they took or better yet, they share the same passion of the ocean in its glory.
Although, I really like it, it is so horror..hehe..

Tomorrow Crystal and I are going to Myeongdong for the fabled large ice cream and maybe another look around Forever 21 because I feel like I still need more short sleeved shirts. We might also go around Idae or Insadong. THEN we’re going to Nam San Tower (finally), which really must be seen at night. So, a busy day tomorrow. Luckily, I’m caring less and less about homework and such and so I don’t really feel the pressure of schoolwork (this is partially because I’m being to feel ready to go home and partially because the work here is really ridiculously easy). Also, I don’t think I’m going to be able to see the babies this Sunday again since this cough is staying with me. This morning I hocked up some green gunk, so that was fun. I’m hoping this thing is reaching it’s peak so I can start getting back to not buying a packet of cough drops every day.
The first serial I wrote came as a request from Gaynor Davies, Fiction Editor of Woman’s Weekly. The magazine had published two 6000 word “cosy crime” stories of mine within a period of a year, both featuring the same heroine, DC Casey Clunes. When some seven years ago Gaynor suggested I might try my hand at writing a full-length, 3 or 4 part crime serial I must admit that initially I was thrown into total panic.

Note that I like to include a label with my checkboxes. This is not mandatory but I have found that if you do not include a label for this element than the user must place the mouse pointer directly over the little box to make a selection. With a label they can click anywhere along the label and the box will be selected (or deselected).
Not very scientific, is it? Why not just scrap the poll, when they learn how lopsided the sample is? Answer: they don't care because they figure there are enough stupid people to accept what it says, with no scrutiny at all.
As I’ve argued before, as someone who mostly studies employment policy, one of my biggest problem with the education “reform” crowd is their tunnel vision when it comes to education and poverty. Focusing solely on college preparation – in other words, solely on labor supply – is a bad strategy either for workforce preparation, employment, or anti-poverty when you consider the manifest problems of the American labor market.
We ended the evening at about 9:30 p.m. putting on the second coat of white paint, in the garage with mediocre lighting. And no picture to share, but again, it's all about the suspense and build up, let's just say they were looking pretty fantastic, like a whole new piece of furniture, and we could have called it quits on just the white paint part! But we will keep plugging away at the remaining steps when I head back for our final makeover day.
I also have to mention that tonight Emory prayed that we could "feel in our church and our gospel". I think that means feel the spirit. She also prays nightly that Travis can drive home safe from Africa. I love that child.

Apologies for the absense! The internet in my halls of residence has been kaput for the last week and I've been spending lots of time in the library (quite a rarity) with exams just around the corner and the conditional incentive of a semester studying abroad in Massachussetts as a kick up the arse to do well.

I was not in the best place when i was writing and didn't want to carry what was in the past into the future with me. I prefer 2010 to stay where it is in the past and rather than focus on all the bad things that happened in that year i am putting all my time and effort into how wonderful 2011 will be , I have lost people who were close to me for reason i still cannot figure out and still miss them dearly , I have made some new wonderful friends who are definately keepers and also rekindled a friendship with one of my dearest friends who was having some trouble conceiving but is now expecting her first in March and i am hosting her baby shower ,

Being straight forward requires confidence. Such people know that those who face their fears head-on, will meet success and joy. Honesty and courage will always be the ultimate winners.
To compare price tags, the original Paranormal Activity was made for around $11,000 while the sequel was budgeted at $2,750,000. I’m willing to believe that some of that went to hiring better actors and it definitely shows in places, but what about the rest? Special effects probably ate up much of this bill, but it’s hard to notice which may be a nod to the film’s practical effects.
Virginia State Police troopers’ duties to check on registered sex offenders could be shifted to unarmed civilians under a little-noticed provision in the two-year state budget pending before the General Assembly, reports the Virginian-Pilot. Tucked into the $85 billion spending blueprint is Gov. Bob McDonnell’s proposal to hire 43 “non-sworn” personnel to monitor people “required to comply with the requirements of the Sex Offender Registry.” Under the current system, troopers and state parole and probation officers conduct semi-annual residence and employment status checks on thousands of registered offenders.

“Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth Me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in Me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.” Matthew 18:3-6 (KJV)
If you’re going for an iconic Doctor, it needs to be the Fourth. It’s the one everybody recognises. I still don’t know where we got the scarf, but it was perfect. Sadly the only photos I have of my father in that outfit are blurry and also feature me, which is why you don’t get to see them. Our props master / set builder constructed a TARDIS, from which we had the Doctor emerge in the opening sequence, in order to invite a group of bored children on a trip to see the Bee Gees. Naturally it goes awry and they spend the rest of the show trekking through the twentieth century, munching jelly babies. Every time one of the kids had to ask the Doctor to clarify one of the suggestive jokes, he would look flustered and reply “I’ll explain later”. In his first entrance we sequenced a flushing toilet to immediately follow the TARDIS materialisation effect, which got the biggest laugh of the night. (I also made the classic mistake of having the Doctor refer to himself as ‘Doctor Who’, which I think can be excused on the grounds that the BBC were doing that in the credit crawl as late as 1981.)

Paris is about 110 miles northeast of Dallas. The Rev. Peter Johnson, a state civil rights leader, said the problems reported at the Turner plant reflect a "culture of discrimination" that lingers in East Texas.
For most eavesdropping on embassies, federal law requires the F.B.I. to obtain an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which meets secretly at a federal courthouse in Washington. By law, if an American citizen calling an embassy turns up on a recording, the F.B.I. is required by law to redact the American’s name from intelligence reports, substituting the words “U.S. person.” That didn't happen here, and Leibowitz simply stole the unredacted material to give to Silverstein.
There shouldn’t be anything wrong with wearing a hoodie. Yes, they’re associated, to some extent, with a violent criminal subculture that exists in inner cities. They’re also associated with high school and college students who don’t bother dressing up for school. If Trayvon wore a hoodie, he was more likely to get associated with the former. If I wore one, I would be more likely to be associated with the later. Why? Because I was born with a slightly different genetic code that gave me less melanin in my skin and two X chromosomes instead of an X and a Y. In other words, it’s because I’m a white female and he was a black male.
I was especially happy that the customer ordered the largest print size available as it is best viewed on a large scale. I still have the original rolled up in a tube at my studio. It was painted with a mix of acrylic paints, wax crayons and chalk pastels and is too large for me to fit into a frame at this present moment. I would really like to frame it some day.
Your characters need to reveal the point you're trying to make. Consider this: Mac turns over video tape of a shooting that involves a police officer. Expecting help from law enforcement, after all he's seen movies about Witness Protection, he's dumbfounded to learn there's no protection available for him. He's on his own. With his wife.
If my brother expects Mom or I to puppy-sit while he's out deer hunting over the next few weeks, he's going to have to bring his kennel. I hate the idea of kenneling Doc, but Christmas is coming up and I don't want to have to deal with him chewing on the gifts, the extension cords, and/or the tree.

Meaningful Apologies. It would be remiss to center instruction on this book without discussions with students about what constitutes a meaningful apology. While the apologies in this collection are purposefully insincere, many others are quite genuine and heartfelt. Read Sorry! by Trudy Ludwig, and I Did It, I’m Sorry, by Caralyn Buehner. Have students identify the characteristics of meaningful apologies, and list them on the board. Then, encourage students to practice writing meaningful apologies, either in poetry form or in prose. Use Joyce Sidman's This is Just to Say, which is an anthology of sincere apologies inspired by the same Williams poem. As suggested in the False Apology Poems activity described above, give them the choice again to write from their own real voices or from another’s.

In New York City, violent crime rates more than doubled between 1965 and 1975. In Detroit, the homicide rate tripled from 1960 to 1980; the robbery rate sextupled. Afro violence was unleashed as never before seen on American soil. And Euros did what any sensible group of people would-- they ran.
Nonintervention with the explicit threat of quick and excruciatingly painful intervention would be a far more cost-effective strategy for the West, and strategic assassination is something everybody can get on board with.
This is partially because, according to Peebles, getting a sense of place for your story by going out and talking with people face to face helps readers connect with your story and presents the possibility of a long-term source-reporter relationship.
I was watching TV last night where Joan Rivers was having another face procedure done OMG. I don't think I will ever go under the knife to look better. I have had to go under the knife for surgery but for things like shoulder surgery where I fell in my garage and did a dive like I was diving into a pool , I was so mad because I fell and then really mad when the Doctor said I tore my rotor cuff and would have to have surgery. i like to keep on the go and I was not going anywhere for a while after that. plus 3 months therapy.Then there was back surgery once for a bulging disk where I missed a step going into the studio and landed on my butt I was wearing socks only on wood steps , beware of doing that

I love the flavor of truffles but the raw almond texture is not that enjoyable when its mixed with rich, creamy pasta. Plus, I ate this at around 11PM and then woke up to fly back to the U.S. at 4AM the next morning. Not a pleasant morning belch, for me or Kristi.

After Fiskars, I was hired as the lead designer of a local scrapbooking company called Kinetic Scrapbooking and worked with them for 5 years. While there, I designed all the samples that appeared on the packaging, on the website, and in all of the magazine ads. I also designed all the class projects that were taught at conventions and stores. Two of my page designs appeared on 2 episodes of Sandy Genovese's show on HGTV called DIY Scrapbooking and also one page design appeared on the Carol Duvall show.
We tend to define love by how we make a person feel. If I say something that makes them feel good about themselves and their lives than I am being loving but if my words hurt their feelings or make them uncomfortable than I’m being hateful. This is simply too surface of an understanding to be love. Love acts on what is best for the person not on what will make them feel warm and fuzzy.

So… let us get to the movie itself: Carnage, which has some passing aspiration to depth with references to atrocities in Darfur and the Congo and to the God of Carnage. At the start, it includes the line “If this kid gets away with hitting people, why would he stop?” – a line included apparently without any intentional irony, despite Polanski’s past – and, towards the end, it includes a line about how, morally, you are supposed to control your compulsions “but sometimes you can’t”.

At 10am I went to the Granada Estates walkover to get the whale bag from Molly. Molly began watch from her home and called to ask me to meet her there because she thought there might be whales nearby as she noticed a group of people at the Jungle Hut walkover looking North. No sooner than I arrived at the walkover when we both spotted two whales at the exact same time!

According to the death certificate, Dickie had received a smallpox vaccination about a week before his death. Mom remembers this as being his second such vaccination, that doctors felt the first one didn’t take. According to Aunt Pinny, Dickie had been sick in bed much of that week. Before leaving for a baseball game that day, Grandpa visited Dickie and told him he’d hit a home run for him, or pitch a no-hitter. When he returned home, he announced to M.A. that he had done just that. M.A. said that Dickie was taking a nap, but that he would love to hear the news. She went upstairs to wake him. A moment later, Grandpa heard M.A. scream. She called for him to come up. She told him something was wrong with Dickie, and told him to carry him downstairs. Grandpa later reported to Pinny that he felt awful, carrying his little brother, because he could tell that he was dead by the way he felt in his arms.

For quite some time I have been managing my condition that involves a severe hormonal imbalance among other wondrous medical phenomena, without taking one pill of the drug variety. (Okay, so in the last year truly managing, prior to that just refusing to take the drugs and sometimes suffering quite a load of consequences. I admit. I like wine, burgers and coffee. So sue me, oh body of mine.)

But lately, she's taken her obsession to a whole new level of crazy. Since she has to compete with the kids and the Man for my attention, she's decided that sitting next to me is no longer acceptable. Now, she insists on planting her fuzzy bum directly on my chest. I don't know about the majority of you, but I'd rather not smell like eau de canine buttikus. So I will gently scoot her tush to one side. Sometimes she's fine with that and will sit quietly, pressing as much of her belly against me as possible. Other times, like when there's a kid already sitting there, she scampers back on to my lap and seats herself on my bosoms. Not acceptable. Again, I will tenderly - but perhaps a little more firmly - adjust her position. And around and around we'll go until a) I stand up b) the offending child moves to another location or c) she gets all pouty.
Resist the temptation to flip on the television when business is sluggish. It might be tempting to switch it on to catch the news or just for some leisure. You ought to know by now that television is addictive. It is easy to be tempted to check out one show after another if the show is tempting enough. If you want to rest, read a book instead, or take a stroll outdoors. Either of those options is much better for your mind and wellness.

I guess it might help us if Chelsea, our opponents on 5th May, progress in the Champions League and still remain in the fight for a top four place? If they have interests on three fronts then perhaps something will give? Allowing for the prioritisation process perhaps it will be the cup? Even allowing for this we should hold no fears about playing them with two league consecutive league wins at their place as well as a Carling Cup triumph.

In the following election in 1997, Kim Dae-Jung finally got his due and narrowly defeated Kim Young-Sam's successor Lee Hoi-Chang. In 2002, Roh Moo-Hyun, who entered politics along with Kim Young-Sam but left his camp in protest of the three party merger, won the presidential race as Kim Dae-Jung's successor. In 2007, however, Lee Myeong-Bak from the opposition regained the Blue House, and that's where we stand now.

“Thank you for coming, gentlemen.” said the Pharaoh, “Your case is awkward, and I’m consequently put in an invidious position. While it’s been determined that it’s likely you were trying to poison me, it cannot absolutely be proved. However, given the seriousness of this suspicion, it wouldn’t be right to free both of you. At the same time it wouldn’t be right to kill both of you. So I’ve decided on a compromise. I’ll let one of you go, and I’ll have the other one of you killed. To show my heart is in the right place, the man I’ll free, I’ll also restore to his former position.”

Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Laini Taylor has received a great deal of pre-publication buzz - trailers, limited proofs and plenty of information. This often makes me a little concerned about whether the book can possibly live up to all my expectations. With the case of Daughter of Smoke and Bone, I am pleased to say my expectations were absolutely surpassed - this is an exceptionally special book.
Fast-forward to late winter 2010. I was deep in finalizing the set list for our Irish Concert, and I needed to program another jig for Megan to dance. I didn't like anything I was finding and was getting frustrated. So I took to my favorite procrastination activity: blog reading. One of my favorites is Cold Antler Farm. Lo and behold, the author had just written about her goat, Finn, and the jig idea came rushing back.

Of that group of friends not one of us became a rapist or sex fiend so you can't claim the experience scarred us too deeply. But I've often wondered about the person that stashed them there. Were they a kid like us trying to sneak a peak? Was it a husband looking to get his jollies without his wife finding out? Maybe that particular water main was simply the home of a scandalous and horny salamander.
As Belicove mentions in the video, the reasons for having a blog tend to add up once the power of hosting a blog is truly understood. Whether a blog be used as a platform to display a company’s unique personality, to report news, lower the cost of public relations, position your employees as experts, or garner customer intelligence, at its core a blog is simply nothing more than a multifaceted and dynamic tool for helping a company to personalize its business and engage with the individuals who support it.

This salad was full of flavor from the cilantro and lemon and I loved the avacado. My sister used black quinoa which I had never had before gave the salad a nice look! This would be an easy salad to throw in a lunch box, or an easy meal for a hectic night!

What I find unusual, though, is that they do this even though the song is somewhat slow (about 80BPM, the low end of “andante”, according to my metronome). Nevertheless, every time they sing that chorus, it’s a very carefully enunciated “twenty wung guns”. Why?
This was a fantastically whimsical garden. Toys and trinkets were a big feature here. It had a very cottage garden feel with lots of bent willow adorning the beds. There were several upside-down trees used in creative ways, lending it a very playful tone as well, almost like a fairy land! The gallery had some great pieces for sale, and it fit well in the garden setting.

Ethnic diversity is no doubt a distinctive feature of Malaysia but the Barisan Nasional (BN) ruling parties – led by the ‘Big Brother’, UMNO – opt to promote individual self-serving racial schema all in the name of promoting the interests of their own ethnic group against the other. This has led to a divisive kind of politics in the coalition since the country’s independence and it has caused grave disunity among the people of various races and religions.
He was not in denial about his age. He wasn’t one of those men who lived thirty years younger. There were no flashy clothes in his closet, no jet-setter tan, no polished white smile. He had driven a convertible only once in all his life and that was on the day he turned fifty; a memory that still managed to flush his cheeks and make him smile. His passport was filled but hadn’t been stamped in several years. He had traveled far in his younger years; sometimes because he had to and sometimes, when he was lucky, because he had wanted to. Only in his old age did he realize that those distant lands and faraway shores never held his heart. With such a realization came the understanding that all reason to return to those places had vanished as well. He had then stopped traveling and simply watched life slow down in steady cadence with his aches and pains.

These words also express something else. They speak about a state of mind, a focus and a concise articulation of the problem. The idea whose time has come is mainly about three things. First: interventions that create a rupture in the order of things with the goal to redefine our fields of experience and the relationship between being, doing and saying. Second: dialogue. Third: creating new emancipatory social institutions.

Jesus also said that we should keep our lamps burning 1. So let your light shine before men that they may Glorify your Father which is in heaven and 2. To keep watch to earnestly be looking for the Lord in everything especially his return. Nothing can be hidden every idle word we have spoken will be made known and every act we have done will be seen.

Are GMOs safe? Most developed nations do not consider GMOs to be safe. In nearly 50 countries around the world, including Australia, Japan, and all of the countries in the European Union, there are significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs. Europe has greater rejection of GMOs due to a more balanced reporting by their press on the health and environmental dangers.

Some of Diane’s empowering stories include: A transient man giving a supermarket coupon away to a stranger, not asking for anything in return. A philanthropist who has pledged to give away much of his fortune, emphasizing that giving should come from the heart. An auto mechanic who assists stranded motorists and refuses any payments, receives assistance himself for a breakdown of his customized truck and a cataract that left him legally blind in one eye. An absentee father, save’s one sons life, unites two brothers over a kidney donation.
The main lesson to learn here is that trying to fight someone on their home turf is not a good idea! Learning all you can about your foe is very important! Most important of all...when you start trying to enforce your rules and control over folks that don't want it, better bring your lunch!
Weibo Ludwig died on Easter Monday. He was an interesting character. A man who has been described as an enigma. Someone who people described as either a terrorist or an environmental hero. We moved here in 1999 from Toronto. People did not know where this town was when we told them we were moving. Weibo was in the news a lot at that time. When I told my colleagues where I was moving, they did not know where that was. I was able to use Mr. Ludwig as a point of reference to say our town is about this far in this direction from him. He was well known.

Communication is the final keyword for a healthy relationship between parents and children, and is a crucial component to dealing with gender identity issues. Even if parents cannot fully understand what their child is experiencing, children of all ages need their parent’s love, acceptance and compassion. If you have a transgender child, remind him or her that your love is unconditional, regardless of whether you find their experiences or identity difficult to understand or accept. Relationships are most fragile when talking stops, becomes unproductive or one-sided. While parents may be charged with the responsibility of caring for their children, as children move through youth and into adulthood they need the opportunity to build social skills and an separate identity in order to survive independently.
So, for those of my more political readers who have wondered why it is that I feel King is worthy of having his entire catalog read/watched and discussed, perhaps this will help you to understand just how much I identify with the man. And for those of you who would rather I just leave politics out of my discussion of the writer, I apologize for the fact that that doesn’t seem very likely.

Recently, I had been corresponding with Ned about his interfaith writing, my interfaith writing, and interfaith dialogue in general. Referring to the fact that he and Mary had retired from Dovetail, he wrote “our children (you) have grown up and can now speak for the interfaith community as it enters its next generation.” I felt both a warm glow at being acknowledged as a metaphorical child of such epic parents, and the daunting challenge of living up to Ned and Mary’s lively, intellectual, spiritual, practical writings.

Downton Abbey in real life is Highclere Castle, situated among a thousand acres of beautiful parkland, perching on a hill with a vantage point of even more spectacular views. It is home to the Earls of Carnarvon for centuries. The book is written by Fiona Carnarvon. Lady Almina is the great grandmother of her husband, the 8th Earl of Carnarvon. The book chronicles the life and legacy of Lady Almina, who married into Highclere at 19, and evolved from a youthful debutante to a seasoned and capable, aristocratic lady with a heart. Here is the source material for the fictional creation so well received by viewers all over the world.

Gove says that he isn't going to tell us which facts to teach. He's appointed a bunch of his mates to do that. There isn't a single headteacher from a comprehensive on the panel. I'm not surprised - we expect this kind of thing from the Tories. But I don't hear much from their coalition partners on this subject. Do any of them really care about education? Do any of them ever read education research findings? If they do then they ignore them. I don't suppose you climb to the top in politics by listening to teachers and researchers.

Alan Bennett’s(1934) Forty Years On(1968) is set in an English Public School, symbolically named Albion House. Bennett counterpoints the reminiscences of a retiring headmaster with an end of term play which his successor is putting on. It is a play that offers a view of 1960s England which is at odds with the old-fashioned values of the retiring headmaster. The final two speeches make explicit the allegory of a nation that has lost a world-wide Empire is looking for a role for itself. Guess where? in Europe! This was in 1968 when we joined the Common Market. These last two speeches give a funny and satiric but also sad and nostalgic flavour of a society going through change. The headmaster’s speech:

What a great way to spend a Saturday! Woke up early, just a little after my normal "get up for work" time, had some cereal, kicked back for a few, then got ready and did some errands. Fun errands. Like, scoring $130 worth of Old Navy clothes for $79, and getting a new purse, and some baby clothes at Target, and just doing fun running around for a few hours. Amazingly, the 4ish hours I was out wiped me out, and I've spent a good chunk of time this afternoon sitting playing in Photoshop. Oh yes, sitting in the glider, which is in a prominent spot in the living room right now. :)

Lastly, the dessert by Philip Speer of Uchiko was Kaffir Lime, Avocado, Honeydew, and Cucumber. This dessert was oh-so-light, citrus-y, and simply uplifting after the meaty meal. There is no doubt in my mind that Philip is really just an amazing magician. His concoctions with flavors and textures makes me wonder if he get his ideas from freaky dreams. I've had some really freaky food dreams, like one which ended with me having a pet pig. I showed the pig at dog shows.

This month your creations can be inspired by all things green and flowery plus all the butterflies, bugs and insects that combine to make a garden.

DADT is a codified form of hatred and discrimination against people because of their orientation. It is unjust, it is evil and it is a policy that our President promised us he would end. President Obama asked us at an HRC banquet in 2009 to “hold his feet to the fire.” That is what we are here to do. Mr. President why did you appeal Judge Virginia Phillip’s ruling that DADT is unconstitutional? Why did you seek a stay to her ruling directing the Armed Forces to immediately stop enforcing DADT?

It appears that the search and seizure of weapons was completed, and that the arrest of Mr Méniére was in process, when Mr Méniére apparently grabbed the student-constable’s firearm and promptly shot him dead. Other reports state that Mrs Jardel suddenly appeared on the scene at that point in time, and also started shooting. The shots were apparently fired while the police were loading the confiscated firearms in the police vehicle.

The trick is accomplished in three steps. The first is by using the total number of jobs and not taking into account that the labor force is much larger now than it was in 1990 or 2001. The second is to date the chart from the bottom of the recession. The third is to ignore all the other post-war recessions.
I opened my inbox this morning to find five new emails. Sadly, no work of the paying variety. One was about last Friday’s Church fete (and I don't like to boast, but between you and me, I've actually been asked to be on next year's fete committee!), one from the beekeeping club to let me know we are now on the Wiltshire Swarm Collectors' list, one from the village allotments’ bicentenary committee talking about getting someone from Gardeners Question Time round, and one from the village book club (and, no, I didn’t manage to read last month’s book, so shouldn’t really be going, but the thought of wine, crisps and friendly conversation is just too tempting…). The last one was another one from Beekeeper man, saying he’d forgotten to add the information about a man from Hitchin who is coming over next month to talk about hives. I'm not actually a member of the beekeepers, but I've asked to be put on their mailing list because I don't want to miss anything exciting happening. What with school governors, the Malmesbury Fair Trade committee, cubs, the local writing group and Countrymummy's fabulous new knitting group (another excuse to catch up on gossip and patronise the local pub under the pretext of swapping knitting tips), it's perhaps just as well I'm not inundated with work at the moment - I'm not sure where I'd find the time to do any. The only local group I haven't yet manage to infiltrate is something called Coffee Pots - a weekly event signified by a large hardboard coffee pot that appears outside the house where it's being held, soon to celebrate its 40th anniversary.

It is when Colin comes back, that he walks into Willa's life. And she's not at all happy. Willa, quiet, unassuming, runs an eco hiking and sports good store. She's lived in Walls of Water all her life, went to college, dropped out of college and moved back after her father's death. Long before that, her family had been as prominent as the Osgood's but in the time of her grandmother they had lost The Blue Ridge Madam and a lot of people had been hurt. Now, with Paxton fixing up the house, she invites Willa along to the opening gala. And Willa definitely doesn't want to go. She wants nothing to do with Madam, with the Osgoods, especially not with Colin. In school Willa used to be the Joker, the prankster, who created havoc. No one knew about it though - she did it quietly, without fuss, and watched the chaos unfold all around her. And then, one of her pranks got blamed on Colin Osgood and for a while she let it go. When she eventually revealed herself everyone was shocked - they couldn't believe it was this quiet girl who had gone about and created this much madness. As a consequence her dad lost his job at school and she blamed herself for basically destroying both their lives.
Saturday, I had the pleasure of attending a baby shower for my favorite Tahoe blend (blogger + real life friend) Natasha! She is having a baby boy next month, and it was so much fun to celebrate with her and to meet some of her friends here in Tahoe. The weather was gorgeous and sunny on Saturday, and I actually ended up getting a sunburn from sitting out on the deck chatting with all ladies at the shower! (I'm not complaining though, I'm so happy that summer is finally on it's way!) I thought it was so neat that she had her shower on Mother's Day weekend, she is going to be a fabulous mom!

Anyway, inappropriate dress, a loud voice and a fondness for low dives are obviously grounds for hanging (for a woman,anyway). Wodehouse may not have been speaking absolutely literally, but he was not being ironic. Supreme comedic writer that he was, there is barely a grain of humour in any of his letters. He was simply voicing what was becoming a general revulsion at Elvira’s all-too-public behaviour.

So we Muslims are baffled when we read and hear that Christmas is being `banned’ and replaced with something else because the organisers do not want to offend Muslims. Where do they get this idea from? Who told them that? Such actions lead to comments like, `It’s those Muslims again. They always have a problem with everything we do. Why don’t they just leave and go back to their own country?’ A majority of British Muslims were born here. Where do we want them to go? Local authorities, organisations and businesses trying to avoid offending Muslims and trying to be politically correct actually cause more harm to cohesion and understanding. There is a need to stem the tide of such ill-thought-out decisions where ruling bodies try to ‘second guess’ the attitudes of the communities and seek to defuse conflicts before they have even been felt or arisen.
Other than proclaiming my love for Celebrity Big Brother and all other awful reality tv shows (the new Geordie Shore starts at the end of the month and I canneigh wait) I don't really have much to say. I'm going to be making a huge list of everyone's names/twitters/blogs who are planning on coming to the LDNLUNCH so keep your peepers peeled for that as it's a good way to stalk talk to people before meeting them, it definitely helped me when I was pooping myself over the Brumbloggermeet! If you do want to ask any questions about the meetup or just fancy a chat then you can tweet me @imeloweez or send me an email (eloise.smith87@googlemail.com), although tbh I may just flap and say "I'll have to ask Sophie or Claire" as I'm not very organised.

We love to say that: amuse bouche. That just means a small, bite size tidbit given from the chef that “entertains the mouth.” Yeah, these freaking did. Beautifully grilled octopus that had nice grill marks and was perfectly tender and bursting with flavor. And, as if that wasn’t enough, we had pork beignets that were candied, cripsy, and just plain beautiful. The perfect mix of sweet and savory. To. die. for. Mary paired these with the Dayden 2010 Dry Rosé from one of our favorite vineyards, Arizona Stronghold.

Kristien and I swear that he ate at Napa & Co before his concert last year because of our Twitter recommendations and sold Mary on the wine, but maybe that’s just our imagination (or wishful thinking because we’re obsessed with Maynard).

Finally, it is always important to interpret obscure passages by those that are clear. Though we affirm the basic clarity of sacred Scripture, we do not at the same time say that all passages are equally clear. Numerous heresies have developed when people have forced conformity to the obscure passages rather than to the clear passages, distorting the whole message of Scripture.
All of this started running through my brain after I read Anthony Shadid's article in today's New York Times on the sudden resignation of most of Turkey's military command. The article does a good job of explaining the importance of the event in terms of both Turkey's current politics and its history. The Turkish military has pretty much run the country for most of its modern history, partly by casting itself as the guardians of secularism. That era appears to be over.

Standing there, I was overcome with a guilty feeling. I had no need for anything to eat at that moment. I wasn’t really hungry. Sure, I had a little rumbly, but that was and is nothing like what some people feel each night before they toddle off to bed. I had eaten well all day: three meals and two snacks. I’m pretty sure I consumed about 1500 calories, had ample hydration, and plenty other than water to drink as well. What was this weird sensation trying to tell me?

Hello Pilgrim Pearl Bracelet in Turquoise by Lizzy House
On the up side, we had some very good food (I had a great truffle pasta that rocked my world), some wonderful wines, a few good desserts and we actually found the service throughout Vienna to be very good. We found a GREAT bar, too, a very old and very tiny one, maybe the size of our dining room in Oslo (big for a dining room, tiny for a bar). This bar was awesome because it was what you want a bar to be, and nothing more. It was from 1908 or so, all original, designed by Loos, and the bartender made the perfect vodka gimlet and in Vienna you can smoke inside, which, honestly, is appropriate for this bar. You can't have a bar like this and NOT allow people to smoke. The bartender was theater and entertainment and refreshment, in one guy. It was great. But the city itself, not my bag. I think the time of year had a large part in this, man was it grey and dreary and depressing.

Having said all that, this is a book that struggles to earn more than a single-star review for its plotting, pacing, and story-telling. It's is a story comprised of musings, observations, and asides, in which very little happens to advance the plot. Being a fictional memoir does excuse the narrative struggle to some extent, but the 'fictional' element does demand something more. There's a great concept at the heart of the story, with Arno able to freeze time and manipulate those around him, but his own odd sense of morality and decorum won't allow him to exploit it, while his own laziness holds him back from maximizing it. Of course, Arno and his failings are, essentially, the story, so it's hard to find him at fault. Still, it's a read that frustrated me to no extent because it adamantly refused to explore the concept.

Many students I have are amazed to hear that from my native Birmingham it's much more common to greet someone with 'Alright' and to say 'Ar' instead of 'I' or 'Yes'.
Christians, is it that important to you to have a manger on courthouse grounds? Do you really think it belongs there, and that you should have sole rights to put up a display on government property?
So you can discredit a scientific finding by pointing out that some bad people believe it? Is that effective?
Also, looking at this picture makes me cringe b/c of the carpet.

Something that was driving me insane for so long and I could have taken care of it all along.

You see what an education is needed for all? We all need to realize that every person has potential to learn and be independent with self-confidence. Fortunately for this young child, her grandmother brought her to Kiki’s Kids in Shigatse. She realized that this blind child needed to learn how to talk and to learn all the other skills that should be happening so she can develop into a productive, successful individual. This is what Kiki’s Kids as a program is all about: providing the learning environment for young people to grow toward independence and to help change the culture there that does not realize the full potential of blind people.

Sometimes I worry that I sound like a real asshole on this here blog. That people think I just flit about, rhapsodizing about pastries, skipping around as if all that mattered was my opinion about Parisian architecture and foreign travels. I know I do flit and skip and go on a bit too much about pastries, but I do it, knowing how lucky I am. How very, very privileged and fortunate I am to be living in Paris, working on Louis Vuitton, traveling to foreign countries, and that I have the freedom to do so much of this on a whim, and, most important, the support and encouragement back home, egging me on. Trust me, I think about it all the time.

In our 20s, the world was totally our oyster. All those fights had been fought. We weren’t going to be ’50s housewives, we were in college, we could pick and choose from a menu of careers… We were smart women who had a lot of options and made intelligent choices… We were the proteges of old-guard feminists… We were sold more of a mission plan and now you guys… Well, sadly, it all seems like kind of a mess. There is no mission. Even stay-at-home moms feel unsuccessful unless they’re canning their own marmalade and selling it on the Internet.

Despite being a bit shy initially, I am quite a sociable person. I like people and I like to have a good chat. I am fairly open and honest and, not very good at lying. I have to admit that I'm also not particularly good at small talk. I like a proper conversation. One where you really connect with someone. Of course I now know that, once you have a child, you only ever really get to participate in small talk mostly because you are interrupted every 30 seconds! This remains a bit of a challenge for me but I'm getting there.
These scones have TWO layers of glaze. The first layer is a simple plain glaze and the second glaze is spiced with nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and cloves. (If I remember my baking teacher correctly, many commercial scones are glazed to keep them from drying out..thus, a longer shelf life.)

The animation is magnificent, motion capture seems to be taking baffling strides with each new instance. In this film, the textures are so realistic I frequently found myself forgetting it was animated at all. One scene, in which Thomson (Nick Frost) and Thompson (Simon Pegg) are chasing a pickpocket (Toby Jones), almost looked like a live-action film with only cartoon heads superimposed on the actors. I believe in the value of motion capture animation, and its because of films like The Adventures of Tintin that I do; Spielberg avoids the uncanny valley by replicating the exaggerated human features of Herge’s original drawings, but is able to combine realism and fantasy seamlessly by using a uniform aesthetic which I believe to be more effective than a combination of live-action and CGI. Spielberg deftly captures the sense of adventure and excitement of the original Tintin comics, and at the same time just happens to create a film closer in tone to the original Indiana Jones films than the last Indiana Jones film. Exotic locations, daring tales of adventure, and daunting predicaments are all part of Herge’s plotting and Spielberg hasn’t lost any of it in translation. This is what Spielberg does best; Raiders of the Lost Ark is a tribute to action/adventure serials of the 30s and 40s, films that contained the same sort of spirit as Herge’s books. Spielberg knows how to craft adventure and here is a film that feels exactly like Herge’s comics. There are amazing set-pieces throughout The Adventures of Tintin; chases, plane crashes, all sorts and they’re brilliantly choreographed. One scene in particular, a chase through crowded Middle Eastern streets is just a positively thrilling action sequence, one of the film’s many moments that had me genuinely panicked.
When you actually start exploring fractions, I have found two fabulous songs that I use all the time. The first one is by Dr. Jean and it's called "Fraction Pizza". When we sing the song, I use plastic fraction pizzas that I bought at a local teacher store. I've also seen velcro pizzas at Toys R Us. If you can't find these toys, you can just make an art pizza with markers on a paper plate. The second song that I like to use is "Fraction Is Part Of A Whole" by Miss Jenny, and it's also about pizza.

First of all, thanks to all of you who gave me such great advice regarding the whole cruise idea. I think what it boils down to is that I'm very sentimental when it comes to my girls and spending time with my family. My sister-in-law wrote me about all of this yesterday...I seek out her "words of wisdom" pretty often. She said that I'm not going to have many more Christmases where it's just Chris, me, and the girls. She is so right, too. They'll be off on their own before much longer and Christmas as we know it will become a thing of the past. Guess that's why I want to relish in those special moments all the more. I suppose what it comes down to is how Chris feels about all of it. If he's all for it, I will be on board. His brother and mom are going to tell him sometime this weekend, so I'll be sure to report back next week.
Or of course, it'd be a great present to keep for yourself!! ;)
Turns out they really liked my story–it was among the very last to be cut. Considering that they receive thousands of entries each quarter, this is good news. Furthermore, those aspects of the story I was most concerned with perfecting (the struggle of the main character, the resolution to that struggle, and the emotional gravity of the situation) was, according to her words, very engaging. Great!
I had every intention to take pictures and point out where different things happened in history.
You expect an organisation like Aid to the Church in Need to document the persecution of Christians in the Middle East – which it does assiduously. See their News Section for various updates, e.g. the ethnic cleansing of Christians in the Syrian city of Homs, which has created a forced exodus of over 50,000 people to the surrounding towns and villages; e.g. fears voiced by ACN-UK Director Neville Kyrke-Smith that ‘the Arab Spring is threatening to turn into a disaster for Christians in the Middle East – and Western indifference is making the problem worse’.

But then something strange happened. The guns began to take on lives of their own in Broadmore's imagination. "I started to fill in the back story of the world where these guns came from," he explained. "And it started with advertising. I wanted to explore the social world of Grordbort via the ads he created for his guns." The result was the first graphic novel about Doctor Grordbort's world, Doctor Grordbort's Contrapulatory Dingus Directory, released last year from Dark Horse. It's a kind of demented Sears Catalog from an alternate early-twentieth century, gorgeously illustrated, and full of ads for the guns, robots, rockets, and electrical servants a colonial conquerer like his anti-hero Cockswain uses.

As I restructure my closet for spring, I have been thinking a lot about my history as a consumer of fashion, my relationship to money, and my adventures in self expression through the fun and versatile medium of clothing. I used to run a really tight ship around here. Once upon a time, when I was a college student selling hot dogs in front of a Home Depot (Best. job. ever. No joke.) I barely had enough money to make rent and eat at the same time, so shopping was limited to thrift stores. This kept me creative and made looking sharp a challenge. I really enjoyed and appreciated my carefully amassed collection of vintage and second-hand finds. Once I got my first job as a baker, I was making enough money to have a little more fun...which meant buying even more clothes from thrift stores, and shopping in the clearance sections at fancy places like Ross and Burlington Coat Factory. Clothes that hadn't been worn before? Heaven. I started moving away from vintage. Then I became a pastry chef, and suddenly I had enough disposable income to shop at Target. I stopped thrifting almost completely, and started buying new, new, new. Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and Forever 21 came into play. Occasionally I would splurge on an item from Nordstrom Rack, and I could even afford a few things from Anthro's clearance section. Because I was miserable in my career, I shopped for comfort. My wardrobe got bigger, but not necessarily better.
This year, since my father is a gimpy old man and my mother is a fucking idiot with a broken ankle, they didn't decorate the house. At all. A neighbor brought over an 18” fake “tree” and put it on a table where the presents were then placed. That's it. And you know what? The house looks fucking better. If my mother would shut the fuck up and stop crying so fucking often because she couldn't decorate the house, I wouldn't even notice and might actually pay her a compliment about how nice the house looks. But no. All she cares about is the superficial shit around the house that I've been trying to convince

We originally only nailed every 16 inches with two nails. When he took the first break, we realized that we needed to secure it a little more. The Liquid Nail was still wet and the board were moving up and down when we walked on them. That’s when he went back and added the single nail in line with each board.

Weiss seems to be the new star in the extreme Tamil firmament, whether willingly or by unsolicited adoption I cannot say. But over the last two years we have seen Bruce Haigh, David Feith, Jake Lynch, Anthony Lowenstein, Julian Burnside and Damien Kingsbury press claims that parrot the slogans disseminated by the LTTE agit-prop campaigners in ways that place them squarely in the same camp as “fellow-travellers.” As far as I know, albeit in surmise, their positions are not motivated by personal advantage or greed. In each case we have ideologically-directed assessments.

Yet, one step past Kelo concerns are the interests of the new small-property owners whose entire equity has been wiped out in the ongoing collapse of real estate prices that followed the 2008 debacle. Working-class property owners, while conscious of themselves as “owners,” are also increasingly conscious of themselves primarily as debtors, and are finding their economic and political interests antagonistic to those of larger investors. This movement is not class-conscious, now, but it does not have to be conceded to the right populism of the “Tea Party” variety (or even worse). Just as the environmental movement, pursuing social goals, can make use of the contradiction between “property rights” ideology and the reality of ever more polarized wealth, other creative paths shall also emerge.

This one presented a bit of a challenge when I went to buy ingredients at the LHBS. With Wyeast 3942 (De Dolle) out of stock, I was left scratching my head for a substitute. 3864 (Unibroue) seemed a reasonable substitute. No Amarillo whole leaf hops also forced a choice between Cascade leafs and Amarillo pellets for dry hopping. I chose the pellets and I'm not sure it was the best choice as they were a pain to separate from the beer and they seemed to affect the flavor.

RR—One of the reasons I put those stories in there is that I wanted to present the entire picture of the stuff that goes on down there. It would be easy just to dismiss the Karankawa sightings. I talk to a lot of Bigfoot researchers around the country, many of which don’t wanna think there’s any paranormal aspect to the Bigfoot sightings. They think somehow it cheapens the Bigfoot research efforts if you bring up anything weird or pertaining to the paranormal. And the same way with UFO investigators. They don’t wanna to think it has anything to do with Bigfoot. And by the same token I could have ignored these stories about the Karankawa Indians.

The Zionists promised the British that they would get the USA to join the war on the British side. They asked in return for the British to give Palestine to the Jews. The fact that Palestine belonged to the millions of Palestinians who lived there was of no concern to the Zionists or to the rulers of Britain. At the time, Americans had no interest in fighting in Europe, so a wave of propaganda had to be created to so enrage the American public that they would rush in to attack the Germans.

Recently, I made a huge faux pas on Oscar night when I called the famous band Coldplay, Cole Slaw. My very hip and happening contemporaries shook their heads in despair and proclaimed that it is because of people like me our generation is getting a bad rep. After being duly chastised by my daughter and my friends I embarked on a journey to hip dom by listening to Sahana’s favorite songs on you tube. But the lyrics! Oh, the lyrics! I didn’t understand half the things I heard, the other half that I did understand made my face go red! The good thing that came out of all this is my reverence for my daughter’s ability to decipher the undecipherable music that blares from the radio – the raps, the computer generated/modified songs. I try to focus on the lyrics but all I hear is a human voice speaking gibberish. ‘What was that? What did he say?’ Sahana starts singing/rapping/howling along, enunciating each word for her mother’s benefit.

I haven't shared this yet, but I've been feeling compelled to memorize scripture lately. I haven't really memorized ANY since I was in high school, when I was basically required to memorize a lot. I don't know why I suddenly feel compelled. I can't explain it. Memorizing anything, really, used to sound like such a chore, as if I were cramming for a Bio test in college. But for whatever reason, I have a new and somewhat urgent desire in me to make it happen. It has a bit to do with the time I have, now that the kids are in school all day and I am reading the Bible a lot more and realizing that I want to know where things are, and want to be able to easily recall things for the sake of both equipping myself and teaching my children.

Are we a product of our biological inherited characteristics (nature) or a result of the influences we absorb throughout out lives (nurture)? I believe how we are is due to a mixture of both nurture and nature and as a result our behavioural traits are not fixed. Whilst it is true that some things are dictated by genetics (for example race, color and many inherited conditions) your environment and the people in your life have a major effect on your behaviour. You are your own person, you have your own identity and make your own choices. The characteristics your mother or father display are not your destiny. Learn from other people’s experience, so you don’t suffer the same mistakes.
Taking a deep breath she continued, “Ok, so then, here’s the new idea; instead of leaving it in your wardrobe, and gradually building up such a huge store of unwanted clothes that you have to buy a new house to keep them in, as we have all been doing so far, what you do is…You Take Them To A Store And Give Them Away.
i’m gonna have to start doing some more name research. my other favorite authors? tom robbins, thomas hardy, t.s. eliot (and yes, i’ve considered eliot)… i can’t really think of any more. and characters? it seems like i really like girl characters (and girl names).

So thanks to D, I went about it almost immediately.
Twenty feet to the rear of us lay a beach with starfish, sea shells, and sand crabs dotting the shoreline, all but abandoned by humans. Strange since it was summer vacation. My family and I stood in the middle of a half a mile long, wooden pier that had a lot of splitters along the edges.
While there are some very big names making very big money on Kickstarter, it’s also nice to see indy projects by no-names succeed. There are lots of people out there with great ideas for board games, RPGs, or anything else, which would never make it into a company because the margins on games are low and it’s tough to decide that you’re going to make and market a game when you have no idea if it will sell. With Kickstarter, you know exactly how well it’ll do before it goes into production. You don’t have to make 2,000 copies of a game and hope they sell. You can put your project up with a target of 2,000 copies, and ship those copies directly to the people who want them when the project meets it’s funding goal, without worrying that some stores will have copies languishing on shelves, or will have customers who want it but they don’t have it in stock. And if the project doesn’t fund, then nothing happens and there’s no loss. It’s perfect for projects where the middleman introduces a risk of failure, or at the very least of increased costs. It’s a dangerous place for a game addict like me to hang out, but it also gives you the impression tat anything is possible.
Yet, media freedom is fragile, and it is also not yet within the reach of everyone. Furthermore, as more reporting is transmitted online, more and more online journalists including bloggers are being harnessed, attacked and even killed for their work.
Though property damage in the surrounding area, caused largely by fire, destroyed much of the existing CCTV hardware, footage from those left untouched was later combined with that automatically transmitted to police headquarters to provide a gripping, though fragmentary, depiction of the last stand of the surrounded militia members. For approximately an hour, the gradually dwindling band tried to fight its way back out of the ex-ACZ it had entered, inflicting scores of casualties on Muslims armed with firearms and Molotov cocktails. The end, when it came, was gruesome. After running out of ammunition, the sole surviving militia member, with a gunshot wound clearly visible in the left side of his abdomen, was surrounded and torn to pieces by an enraged Muslim mob.

Anyway — here's an advertisement that appeared in National Geographic, I believe, when Union Carbide first started operations in India.
I had another only in Paris moment last night—I, um, also went to Starbucks. This was my first visit to a Starbucks in probably seven or eight months and the only reason I went is because we had a meeting for work—a Sunday evening meeting before the madness of this week began. Just like New York, Starbucks are everywhere in Paris and they’re a convenient and logical meeting place. Except this one had twenty-foot ceilings and crystal chandeliers. Probably faux-crystal, but still, it was funny to be sucking on a raspberry frappaccino in such grandeur.
4. Huge traffic. There are 3.370.000 people in Athens + huge number of visitors. So no wonder if everybody would like to move from friend`s house to house or to the party and everybody is doing it by car or taxi – there is going to be TRAFFIC! So as all my Greek friends suggested – stay at home or friends` home to avoid it. I spend 2 hours in the car from Keratea to Imithos, most of this time was spend standing in the traffic jam inside the city.

In New York City, where yoga has become as secular an activity as spinning or step aerobics, the potential sins of yoga are not typically debated by those clad in Lululemon leggings. But in some predominantly Muslim pockets like Jackson Heights, Queens, yoga has been slow to catch on, especially among first-generation immigrants, newly arrived from cultures where yoga is considered Hindu worship.

It was announced yesterday by the administrators that they will make a report to creditors this week, as they are legally obliged to do. But they also stated clearly that no proposals regarding actually paying any money out will be made until the bids to come in tomorrow have been looked at in detail. So a further delay then.
the children and i are eating raspberry jam from small packets with a knife. he has already criticized us for this, but it never occurred to us not to do this. this is what we wanted to do. this is what we do - often, although usually peanut butter. (sadly, there is no peanut butter.) i look up. i can not tell him what i already know, not in full but in part, in practice inside my life, do what you truly feel, not what you feel is expected. he will not hear me. instead, i take another scoop of raspberry jam and i lick the length of the knife.
Approximately 12 feet from his grave is the grave of Clyde Tolson, the gay lover of J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover’s grave is about 45 feet away (a discreet and respectable distance) from Tolson’s grave. This very cemetery is a poignant illustration of the terrible cost of silence and fear. Shakespeare said the brave man dies but once, the coward dies a thousand deaths. Think of the many times Hoover and Tolson had to lie about themselves and each other. Think of the self-hatred and pain that ultimately was turned outwards to LGBTQ people like Matlovich. We hate most in others what we hate most in ourselves.

So back home to the usual round of hospital visits, work, drink, dog-walking and sleep with precious little time for anything else, although playing the blues deep into the night is a must. I can't even get annoyed about this most Tory of Labour Governments. Suffice to say if it wasn't for the inefectual opposition, the longest period of Labour power would be over. I wouldn't shed a tear. At least you know what a Tory Government would do. Furthermore, any cabinet with a practising (cilice-wearing?) Opus Dei member doesn't deserve support from the likes of me.

Some bad news and some good news recently: my favourite boutique here in Small Island City closed last month. The vivacious owner decided that she'd had enough fun during her ten years as shop owner and was now ready to enjoy retirement. While attempts were made to sell the business, it's hardly the economic climate for that right now, and instead, the windows were emptied, racks cleared, shelves purged.

I told seekers that they should expect, in due time, to see both Beings of Light and Beings of Darkness inclusive of Dark Masters. As we accelerate in our Path, Light Beings would routinely manifest to us to assure us of their love, guidance, protection. Likewise will Dark Masters manifest, forewarning us that if we go wayward or use beneficial energies for dubious purposes, they’d be the one to catch us.
I called up to my overworked and severely underpaid partner – it was past time for her to take a little break. While I waited for her to get to a stopping point, I pulled out two bottles of Courir de Mardi Gras beer from the back of the fridge, and poured them into a couple of fancy-pants Belgian beer glasses.

The education Guardian on Monday June 25, 2007 told us the other part of the political elite the Conservative party ”announced last month that if it won the next general election there would be no return to grammar schools on the grounds that they do little to benefit children from poorer backgrounds. Instead, the party has promised to continue Tony Blair's flagship education reform and support the expansion of the academy schools programme - independent state schools sponsored by business.”We must counter these attempts to destroy our children by cultural Marxists. Parents must take back responsibility for their sons and daughters from the state. We need to re-introduce grammar Schools or even found new public schools to impart traditional values like honour, duty and service; others must consider Home Schooling networks to give their young the standard of education the state schools are denying them and to instil self-worth and a sense of belonging instead of teaching them to give up their country to outsiders and to become sexual perverts. We must revive local fairs and festivals and develop our Folk music traditions by taking traditional forms but using words and sentiments suitable for our present time to express our sufferings under the elites. These are not rationalist formulae but suggestions for our creative young people to develop in practice. They will forge natural, emotional bonds with their own people, their traditions and civilisation.

I get angry with my family sometimes. I ask the Lord, “Why must I have a ringside seat, to this whole process, with my mother’s most difficult stage of her life.” But then He reminds me of all of the other events I had experienced, with her. I have the most compassion, when it comes to this, and I see that it was not by coincidence, that she’s ended up in my home.

Boil the pasta or noodles in very well salted rapidly boiling water (it should taste as salty as ocean water). Drain the pasta and add it to the white sauce in the bowl, along with your meat and/or veggies, and mix well to combine. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper if necessary, and thin with more milk or some reserved pasta water if it doesn't seem saucy enough. Now would be the time to add cheese if you want it (cheddar or even some grated parmesan would be good). Any other seasonings you like (chopped pickled jalapenos, chopped roasted red pepper, chopped fresh herbs, etc) can be added now.
God brings people across your path and encourages you to love them, but He lets you manage your relational responses. Thus, marriage revolves around deliberately making choices to love another person. You can improve your opportunities for romance by getting out and choosing to sacrificially love people. Or, you can opt for selfish or reclusive behavior and diminish your relational prospects. The quality of your social life hinges on the choices you make.

So at first, my frosting was a clear glaze, paling in comparison to the bright white icing in the Cooking Light photo. I sadly dripped the watery goo onto the first layer, watched it immediately soak into the cake, and knew something was wrong. But too frustrated and sticky to reach for the measuring cups, I just added more powdered sugar until I had the right consistency. That’s the great thing about this frosting. You can wing it.
Dan won fair and square in the August poll, but I had more votes than any other member of the community council has ever gained! It is a travesty that the support that I gained in an open election should be overridden by internal favouritism.
Please someone explain to Ayalon that if people who are proud of an identity had the duty to become part of the place where that identity is majoritarian, all Mormons around the world should relocate to Utah and, more to the point, all Jews around the world should emigrate to Israel. While I'm sure Ayalon would be delighted to see Argentinian Jews make aliyah en masse, I'm not so certain he would be happy with American Jews taking the same step. A Lobby-less Israel is as nightmarish a prospect as one full of returning Palestinian refugees.

The problem is you are making the same mistake as the people who stereotype blacks make: confusing-the-part-with-the-whole. And, unlike Pat Buchanan and other conservatives voices, I’d like to declare: that is not a rational way thinking! It is stupid! It is illogical! And it is hurtful and damaging to everyone in America.
Now I'm back to work, work, work. I discovered while cleaning the brewery this morning that the sump that services the brewery and the prep kitchen is stuck off, meaning that fat from the grease trap is messing with the float. Another job, I guess. But it's not so bad. It's a beautiful Spring day, and summer is coming with the teaming hordes sitting outside on the patio drinking proper pints of small bear and chomping on great pub specials off the specials blackboard. I also am thinking through what to brew for my 100th batch, which will take place on Thursday. That jar of oak chips that have been soaking in Laphroaig for over a year might find a home in this endeavor. See you at the pub.

Anyway I brought up how upsetting that was for me and was inadvertently smiling while doing it. He asked me to try to show him with my face what that was like. So with my words and my face I showed him. I teared up and said that it was hurtful and that I didn’t like thinking that I burdened my friends and family that when he said that it felt like he was confirming the lie that I believe. The lie that no one wants to spend time with me, that they are forced to spend time with me.

The emphasis on the sin scale was always on homosexuality. Everytime someone preached from the Bible, it was about the condemnation of this sin, “but through the mercy of G-d and the atonement made by Jesus, the sinner can be free from homosexuality and saved for eternity”. That was the simple message from the church pulpit. Of course I felt offended and violated, but I kept a good face and kept my spirits up. Soon I had more work to do in the church.

Also, updating your social media profiles only once a week will not do much for your business. If clients and potential clients see tumbleweeds spinning across your profile, due to lack of activity, they will tune you out and move on to more interesting people. However, if people come to recognize that you and your business are a regular part of their online life on a day-to-day basis, they will be much more likely to ask questions, to respond to requests, and ultimately to do business. Like all marketing media, frequency is key.

I don't know if you have ever tried this or not.. But You can take a clear button and some clear glue and make a little embellie to match your project. Just lay the button on the area of the PP that looks good to you. Draw a line around the button, fussy cut it out. Then Attach to your button with the glue. You might wanna sand the edges a bit to give a cleaner finish. On mine in the pic above I also added some thin ribbon and ran it through the wholes. Then added a bitty pearl from my stash to complete it. Hope you enjoyed the project this week and don't forget to check out the store for these Gorgeous Papers from Scrapcake!
This brings up several disturbing facts… Not only are some countries now producing animal products that are potentially laced with neotame residues, but they’re clearly stating that the “diet” sweetener increases the amount of fodder consumed by the animals, so how exactly is it supposed to help you lose weight? Loss of appetite control is never a good thing when you’re trying to lose weight, and the statement made about Sweetos fodder speaks volumes about neotame’s impact on your appetite.

NOTE ON ASAFOETIDA: This comes in many varieties. I used to have a very potent one, and using only the the smallest pinch gave off an immense, big-on-umami, garlic-like essense. Now I can’t find it anymore and have resorted to some other product, also going by the name asafoetida, but actually only containing a small amount and mixed with rice powder and other things. Now I need to use quite a bit more to get the same kick. The other explanation might be that my taste buds have deteriorated and it has all been the same stuff all along. Who knows.

Getting back on topic, I know that many of us will set new goals for ourselves this year and the question I ask is are you asking the right type of questions in order to get the answers you really want? You see, your brain is very much like a computer and you will get out of it only the answers to the questions you ask it. For example, if you ask yourself every morning as you look in the mirror, “why am I so fat”, your mind will automatically search for answers as to why you are so fat. Now, if you adjust your question to something like “how can I lose 15 pounds by next month”, your mind will automatically begin searching for solutions to that question. This is nothing new or complex to understand. If you don’t believe me, try it for yourself for just one day. Instead of asking questions that will get you negative answers, make sure you ask questions that will elicit positive responses.

Stop and think about it for a second. We could have burned the oil – as per the original contingency plan that had been on the books since 1994. But the Obama regime wouldn’t allow it. We could have used dispersants to break down the oil and make it easier to deal with. But the Obama regime wouldn’t allow it. We could have borrowed skimmers – and all kinds of other critical equipment and clean-up know-how – from all over the world to collect the oil. But the Obama regime wouldn’t allow it. We could have used hundreds of miles of boom that were literally sitting unused in warehouses. But the Obama regime didn’t bother to obtain it. We could have built sand berms that would have blocked the oil from reaching the most critical coastal areas. But the Obama regime has done everything possible to stop it.

Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. (1 Cor 6:9-11 NIV)

The night we took down the Christmas tree, I put the living room back in order and then sat on the couch looking at my room. I thought about how much easier it would be to rearrange the furniture if we didn't have the fireplace. We have lived in our house five years and have not used the fireplace once because when it was inspected, they told us the inside was cracked. And on top of that, Jon never wanted a mess in the house and I guess he has something against awesome smelling, warm crackling fires.
Preachers are not afraid to say that we shouldn’t miss church, they aren’t afraid to say that we should attend as much as possible, but there are few and far between that will say, “The word of God says that it’s a sin to willfully miss church and not assemble around His table.” It’s not being around His table that according to verse 29&30, we #1) trod under foot the Son of God (His body) #2) count the blood of the covenant which sanctified us an unholy thing (His blood) and #3) insult the Holy Spirit (who prompts us to be faithful to this covenant renewal.)

It was bound by a cocoon and was struggling to release itself from this cocoon. It strove very hard to come out of it. But try as it may, it was not able tocome out of it even by a centimeter. But it never gave up its efforts. It tried and tried.

This time of year, I am not here. My mind is in another place, a place that settles me, the road and the Southwestern U.S. It’s a place of refreshment, rejuvenation, energy, love, challenge, and a place that is bigger than me. It reminds me of my place, my smallness. Every moment seems a blessing whether it be spotting a canyon wren or watching a turquoise bellied lizard do push-ups on a rock. It unlocks all the emotion and experience locked inside and sets it free, so I feel unburdened, forgiven, and whole.

The Fly Agaric Mushroom (Amanita Muscaria), that little white-spotted red-cap growing deep in the forest that appears so very often in fairy tale illustrations is a mushroom long revered by northern Shamans as a gateway to the Other World. Its hallucinogenic properties could take you to realms of deep knowing, beyond the everyday. I would like to here make the connection between this striking red and white fungus and the 'little hut' in the forest that belongs to that old woman. Both are found deep on the dark woodland floor, both are alike in shape, both take you to the other world. In some tales (such as Hansel and Gretel) children are tempted to directly eat of the house. In others, the journey to find the old lady's dwelling, losing oneself in the forest along the way and facing the terrors within the 'hut' could all be symbolic of the shamanic initiation process one would go through as a result of ingesting the Fly Agaric mushroom. To enter iron-toothed Baba Yaga's skull-lined chicken-legged house, or to approach the devouring wolf inside the hut of Red Riding Hood's grandmother are perhaps to face, whilst in Fly Agaric reverie, the fact of one's own death and other dark truths of nature.

i guess i am the only person in the free world that hasn't seen this before today, but just in case there are others of you living in a magnolia-free bubble for the last two decades, let's synopsize: it is about the lives, loves and bonding experiences of a group of southern women in a time and place that could only ever be the late 1980s. using dolly parton's beauty shop as a sort of base of operations, they gather to exchange wisecracks, plan julia roberts' wedding, exchange wisecracks, ponder the impenetrable male psyche and then exchange wisecracks. not long after the wedding, julia announces that she is with child. it's a mixed blessing, though, as she is severely diabetic and her pregnancy could endanger her life. the baby arrives, and is healthy, but the stress on her body was too much, causing kidney failure. she receives a kidney transplant but it turns out to be a stopgap measure, at best. she collapses at home one afternoon, entering into a coma that she never comes out of. the family eventually removes her from life support and after her funeral, left finally in the company of her other friends, sally field, julia's mother, finally reaches her breaking point. the tight-knit group sees her through it and, as we head toward the credits, daryl hannah announces that she is pregnant and asks to name the baby after roberts' character. the cycle of southern life begins anew.

The population of Odanak is mixed, however Abenaki represent 70% of residents and even today one can determine membership in one or the other Clan. Some names are reminescent of ancient tradition, M'Sadoques means "person of the great river", O'Bomsawin "person who maintains the fire". The community has been welcoming visitors since 1960, for instance the first "aboriginal" Museum is found at Odanak. Cultural life is steadfastly maintained. There are celebrations of the Harvest time, the time of Ice Fishing, and the arrival of the Geese. But the festival considered the most important is the largest Pow-Wow which is held the first weekend of July to which all are invited, Abenaki on both sides of the invisible line (colonial border) as well as other Nations North and South.

Other studies done in Canada, Ireland and Britain have produced similar findings.(September 8, 2003)

By beautifully blending the modern with the classic burlesque, Von Teese has become a feminine icon, showing strength through sexuality. Always inspired by the art of glamour and through her use of incredibly beautiful sets and detailed costumes, Von Teese gives the grandest of shows worldwide. Some of her most famous dances feature a carousel horse, a claw-foot bathtub, a giant powder compact, and her take on Sally Rand’s popular feather dance. Undoubtedly her most famous act though is her cocktail glass show, where she performs a classic striptease that culminates in her bathing in the glass.

We had a nice little celebration here at our house for Gabriella's first Halloween. My father in law, Rick and Madeline were able to come out here from Arizona to spend some quality time with her. It was a pretty low-key weekend because I'm still (STILL!) not feeling very well. Slowly getting better, operative word being slowly. We went trick or treating around the neighborhood and Gigi scored us a little candy - we felt so creepy going up to peoples' doors with her because it either looks like a) we're morons who will give a baby candy or b) we're jerks who exploit our baby for candy. But it was social practice for her! She had so much fun in her costume and was so cozy in there. I was worried because she had been pretty fussy during the day, but once the costume came on she was all smiles. Anyway, here are the goods - my little Ducky!

Whilst moving, adults shift their ‘grown-up’ ties, burdens and worries merely to a new geographical location.

Cf. “It was about the dawning or daybreak when, tired with a tedious solitude and those pensive thoughts which attend it, after much loss and more labour, I suddenly fell asleep. Here then the day was no sooner born but strangled. I was reduced to a night of a more deep tincture than that which I had formerly spent. My fancy placed me in a region of inexpressible obscurity, and—as I thought—more than natural, but without any terrors. I was in a firm, even temper and, though without encouragements, not only resolute but well pleased. I moved every way for discoveries but was still entertained with darkness and silence; and I thought myself translated to the land of desolation” (Thomas Vaughn, Works of Thomas Vaughn, 243).

I'm not sure what the end of the story is. I'm going to bed, and I'm going to stop mulling it over- maybe thats the conclusion. I feel lighter about it, by a bit, but my lovely evening was rudely broken. Its odd- I was abroad when the 'London' Riots, as they were referred to then, were going on. When it started spreading to other areas, I thought that that kind of behaviour was for cities, and that those sorts of thugs, with their beligerance and rulebreaking, and lawlessness, could never 'belong' where I live, with its rural charm and villagey-pride. They never did reach us, but now I realise that there isn't much of a boundary. People are people. Nobody rioted and put lives and livelihoods in danger outside my house tonight, but they weren't country mice either. I guess I've just realised that you only get away for so long, with living in peace, before somethng like this happens... even if I never thought that it was at all possible, in my beautiful Here.

This anomaly raises the question of how the accuser previously was able to maintain full-time status.

When I visit India, I’m always pleased to meet Trishna Dey who lives in Ghaziabad and listen to some of her new poems. She is an original poet, writes simply without too many difficult or Sanskritised expressions and more or often than not I have found the words enchanting and deeply expressive. Despite the power of her writing she has acheived little success. I suspect that this has more to do with the poor encouragement that India provides to its writers, thinkers and poets than with the content and quality of her writing.

I’m thinking that Ms. M and I might have made too many batches of scones lately because I was rather put out with the pumpkin scone recipe that I followed. Throughout the entire make-y process I was deeply in thought about whether or not I was actually making a scone at all. Firstly the recipe called for the butter and sugar to be creamed – a cake making method and secondly the recipe included an egg – another cake element. The end result was certainly something that tasted like scones, not cakes. The process has left me wanting to research scones more. That in itself worries me… clearly I need a life!!!

As each person crested the rise on the bridge over the train yard and saw the mass of picketers in front and behind them, they must have become aware of the unique nature of this mass picket line forming up, the enormity of the power of the so-called “99%” was becoming self evident. With that image an understanding, a shift in consciousness percolated across the crowd as the solidarity was experienced, the working class of Oakland was becoming self-aware and was self-expressing! We had broken out of our isolation, our atomization and demoralization and were putting our stamp on the international class struggle in a profoundly significant and exemplary manner! The union tops won’t fight the Taft-Hartley anti-strike laws but the working class showed that as a class we could!
Now that we’ve covered every inch of this book, every inch except those that are important, Haunting Violet proved to be a fun, interesting read, abundant with excellent banter and likeable characters. It shed an interesting view on spiritualism (or ‘let’s pretend we see dead people because very rich people are willing to give away their money to those that do because they are also very stupid’), and what people would do for money. I enjoyed it, and I recommend it. In fact, I recommend it to you. So, I say, go and buy Haunting Violet. You probably won’t regret it.

While some of the words and concepts in this book may be unfamiliar to some children, the rhyming text and clear illustrations make it very accessible.

They loved pointing things out, especially the Earth from the perspective of the moon.

Maggie slept too. After the grief, she was a chatter box before she went to bed, talking, laughing and all the rest.

I rarely cook from a recipe, I just add ingredients in whatever proportion seems right, but I will try to explain to you how to make it as best I can.

The quality of coverage should also be displayed more directly and crudely in placement, headlining, word usage, and other modes of mobilizing interest and outrage. In the opinion columns, we would anticipate sharp restraints on the range of opinion allowed expression. Our hypothesis is that worthy victims will be featured prominently and dramatically, that they will be humanized, and that their victimization will receive the detail and context in story construction that will generate reader interest and sympathetic emotion. In contrast, unworthy victims will merit only slight detail, minimal humanization, and little context that will excite and enrage.
The house has had to be tethered to the ground after all that clearing out. It feels so light and spacious and breathable that it thinks itself weightless.

However, when I got to Fort McMurray and repeated the same search, the same website gave me zero results.

As a child growing up, I remember my maternal grandmother making pig ears in her rural Virginia home. Still being too young to be squeamish about such things, I embraced them readily. They were boiled ‘until done’, and simply served on a plate with salt and pepper.

I have tunnel vision; my mind set on the prize.”

When we got it together again, we hiked on another four miles or so to campsites in the saddle of the ridge. We all plopped down for dinner and decided not to leave.

From Music magazine: "Novaes plays her 15 waltzes with steely brilliance, non-dogmatic control and a healthy dash of playfulness and thus provides an excellent alternate view of these works."
I grew up in a family that enjoyed having a good time. My brothers were constantly pranking us five girls. Of course we would always pay back. One particular week stands out more than others when one of my brothers was off work and made our lives miserable. In the process we all started pranking each other something terrible. My father even got in the action. Which was out of the norm. Usually Mom was the one who would go toilet papering with us kids and other “various activities”, all good and legal fun (at least it was legal back then). Toilet papering was our favorite thing to do. If you got toilet papered, you were the coolest people on the block. I remember my friend and I saving up tons of paper towel and toilet paper to get a boy’s house that I had “liked”. I remember one buying spree prompted the store checker to ask us what we were up to….we just smiled. Admitted nothing.
HENRY JAGLOM: Well, how about rephrasing that? It's two questions, really. I can't pick just one film. So how about, what's one film that defines the essence of how I see life? I'd pick VENICE/VENICE (1992). That's what it's really like to be me. It's how life feels to me. Then, DEJA VU (1997). That film represents to me the romantic dream of life that I have always lived with somehow.

I neared the huge blocks (some weigh 10 tonnes), came to a sandy patch, after all the rain and probably the type of sand they used to ‘create’ the beach they were working on, I’d felt and seen that my shoes were leaving deeper imprints… so what?
"Judith of the Lions" is 3000 words of apocalypse with a touch of bizarro. Heavy on metaphorical references. With, you've probably guessed, lions. And a special guest genre.
RaeLynn (Team Blake) @RaeLynnOfficial – Singing She’s Country by Jason Aldean. Before her performance, Blake asked her if she had a bf, to which she said no because she is a heart breaker. As of tonight, she is the only Country artist left in the competition. She has a great swagger about her when she performs. Honestly this is my favorite performance of the competition. I think her fire and spunk make her really enjoyable. This was a great way to start out the night. She still had those weird moments in her voice, but I think tonight worked in her favor. Blake said she proved to America that Country can kick ass. I agree. She has a kick ass attitude. 1-855-VOICE-01

While we were in Boston, Lily stayed with my parents. They were not only her grandparents, but they were also in charge of raising her. They had their own village that offered their support. This consisted of girls I used to babysit for when I was a teenager. They were now married, had families of their own and were ready to pitch in and help watch Lily. While we were out in Boston, we made new friends who were going through the same traumatic experiences.

This book is a true story about the friendship that forms between two men who you would never expect to be friends, and the woman who started the whole thing. One is a homeless drifter who grew up in virtual slavery. The other is an art dealer with money and influence.
The artistically fascinating aspect of Hogancamp's doll house is that his particular appropriation of this societal devil incarnate or Platonic ideal of national sin is communicated through a media that is screaming out kitch, but the episodes of Hogan's Heroes he storyboards and photographs are dead serious. A working-class folk artist, it is reasonable to speculate that Hogancamp's educational exposure to sophisticated treatments of the WWII narrative has been minimal. Be this as it may, his use of GI Joe action figures and Barbie dolls reflects his very modest economic means when it comes to procuring the necessary material supplies for his artistic expression. That he is able to overcome the popular perception of these objects as automatically signifying nothing more than toys for kids - without a trace of irony - is of itself testament to the power of sincerity in art.
Remember Girls Girls Girls Jay-z taught us all it was about girls all day and when I listen to him now I can truly say and with no disrespect he isn’t the same, Jay-z has become a major baller in the game his music has become a tool to make money but in the past it was to share amazing lyrics with the world. I don’t respect him but I do not hate what he does but I hate what he stands for now.
It is super easy to flip through, find a fun technique, and use it for a paper creation! Better yet, challenge yourself by spinning the ATC holder, and use the technique that lands in front of you. This is so much easier to use and see than a binder. I am loving this!
Next is vocation. What will they learn how to do? Will they be public servants like soldiers, teachers, police officers, firefighters, government workers, etc. Will they be apart of the corporate community or will they create the next great corporation through entrepreneurship? Will they be a tradesman? A bricklayer, shipyard worker, a longshoreman, carpenter, or construction worker? Will they be a local merchant or sell insurance?

Peru Travel Tip #004: When ordering over the phone, the phrase ¿Como va a cancelar? means (roughly), “How will you be paying your bill?”. The company wants to know what type of bills you will be paying with so they know how much change to send along with the driver.
I am beginning to like cloudy days because the weather is just right for taking macro photos because the clouds act as a diffuser and cut off any flare or glare from the sun. The best time to take great photos I think is before and after the storm. The air clears after the rain and nature cleans the environment. The light after the rain is soft and beautiful.
Some major Danish companies, and most notably the multinational dairy giant ARLA FOODS have been criticized heavily for trying to appease Muslim fundamentalists by coming with statements criticizing Jyllands Posten and the government. The company has bowed to the Islamists by apologizing for Danish freedom of speech.
This is the result.
chicken and pork and the final dish turned delicious. My brother, who's not usually vocal about food, told me several times that the rice was great. Everyone agreed and I was honestly surprised that my first attempt turned out so good.
Oftentimes I'll arrange meals by what's already in our fridge that needs to be eaten, like, now. So the other day I noticed that we had extra amounts of Gruyere and Pecorino Romano cheeses. As per the first, I stumbled upon this recipe, wrote down what I didn't still have at home, and took a trip to Lucky's.
Similarly, for as long as Africans and Europeans have co-existed on North American soil, these two admittedly large and diverse groups have, in the aggregate, shown markedly different criminal tendencies. The differences seem to be getting more and more marked, and it has become conservative dogma that post-1960s Great Society programs are to blame.
I started sewing up little scraps one piece at a time. As long as the two bits of fabric looked good next to each other, they went into the block.

Hallowe'en has felt this way for me since my very first ritual ever. It's always very conflicted for me as I've never really developed coping mechanisms for things and haven't processed a lot of what's gone on in my life. This isn't to say it's been utterly horrible or that my life in any way compares to others, but I know that some of the things I have experienced have bruised me. Samhain is a time where I allow a little bit of the hurt and fear to be healed at a time. Some years there's a lot more gushing than others but there are always tears. Always.

So even though I thought Lipsyte’s book was average, I wanted to see if I was missing something. So I finished it. And now I move on to my next book. See you in a week.
This unique way to get the attention of wayward students appeared to be a favorite of a King High School assistant principal, although whether it is considered corporal punishment is up for debate.
I began composing songs and playing new ones. I asked my brother in law and music mentor Ryan Stewart to help orchestrate the album. After playing a lot of different tunes I had composed, I laughed about the circus tune that reminded me of clocks. He said, “Play that.” I replied that I thought it was a little goofy and didn’t’ know what to do with it. While playing the piece that Ryan got excited and thought it was brilliant. He began to be filled with ideas. Together we came up with a piece of art that somehow conveys the emotions associated with the haunting feeling of life and how quickly it moves along and yet we hope to maintain a sense of longing for time to stand still. It was beautiful to us.
I haven’t stood still since that Friday night, at 6.20pm. I have been busy doing nothing, busy going back to work, busy being sad, busy being happy, busy being busy. Because if I stopped to stand still I might realise just how empty this friendship has been for a very long time.

From an early age, Staley was exposed to violent and erratic behaviour. His mother attempted to pound a wooden stake through his chest at the age of six or seven and, at a later date, attempted to stab both Staley and his sister with a butcher’s knife. On each occasion she was committed to mental health institutions. Staley’s father was a severe alcoholic and was killed in a road traffic accident in 1985. His maternal grandfather also committed suicide. Staley, himself, subsequently attempted suicide when he was 16 or 17 and was later placed on suicide precautions during his incarceration.
“Harry Potter has never been star of a Quidditch game, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility. All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son Dudley—a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry’s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn’t had a birthday party in eleven years. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives announcing that Harry has been chosen to attend Hogwarts, an elite school for the training of wizards and witches…” (front flap, Arthur A. Levine Books)
Have you read the Post’s profile of the legendary Alex Trebek? It’s pretty darn interesting, and it will leave you prepared to answer the clue, “Trebek used to have two dogs, but one was attacked and dragged off by this wild animal.”
A little while later Daddy walked into the room and looked at both children sleeping in bed and the chaotic mess in their room and couldn’t help but wonder what happened.
Stopped by Evan Lieberman’s blog and stumbled upon a working paper by the International Budget Partnership has brought up the question of transparency among extractive industries. His paper holds that there is no link between transparency and mineral/oil wealth in democracies, but there is an issue of transparency within autocracies. In this paper he drops this little nugget of information — In 2009 petroleum counted for fourteen percent of the world’s trade. That’s an extremely large number for the majority of the world to be completely clueless about. In years of record profit we go, “wow, this is proof that oil is bad” if this is the case I think it’s time to know how/why, exactly.
Still, there's big stuff happening at home, and it is happening most of all down the pit. This is Ed Gardner's first Wagner. And from the moment the lights go off and the orchestra plunges into the deep end, we plunge with them. They grab us by the throat and don't let us go for the full 135 minutes (no interval, thanks). The intensity is fabulous, both at the opera's wildest moments and its stillest; the pacing is excellent, passionate, convincing. This seemed the case after that glorious Rosenkavalier a few months back, but now there's no doubt about it: ENO is busy growing a great conductor.
If you're reading this Tyler and Jacqueline, I'd like to wish you years of love and happiness together. It was truly an honor to be included in your special day. We're proud to have you in the TOMS Family :)
Descent from the ATA was strong; the ATA board of directors voted not to support the measures. ”ATA and its members value the time of our drivers,” ATA President and CEO Bill Graves said following the board’s decision. “However, federal intervention into this area would have significant impacts on the contractual agreements between carriers and shippers.”

To have “Rangers” out of administration requires (a) a successful CVA to be agreed before next season starts, which I think is impossible (Niall, I will come back in detail to your through analysis of why it will happen) or (b) an entity to be playing as “Rangers” which is not in administration.

At that moment I was awake and called:” Lay, come on!” Lazzy call him with an unconscious habit. Lay suddenly looked back and waved his hand towards us , which was beyond our expectation. We almost excitedly burst into tears! I came to think of taking photos ot them.
A man rushes up behind the stunned Eva to help, to call the cops, to do something. “No, no, no … it was my fault,” she assures him. At first this seems like the craziest, most masochistic statement you can imagine.

Once upon a time, Delancey Stewart sat down to write a YA novel. Encouraged by the successes in this market that she’d seen recently achieved by other young (ahem) female writers who were new to the publishing game, she figured she could do it too. And quickly — like in a month — she wrote a first draft. Then she rewrote it entirely, and called it a second draft. Then she exposed it to the glaring light of day and realized that it still needed work. And she was tired.
Rule #1: My parents always used to say that “life is not fair” – what one sibling gets another may not. Everyone does not earn the same income or get the same things. That is life. You get what you get and you get what you work for and sometimes you don’t. You may do everything you are supposed to do and there is a chance that things will not go your way. Everyone does not win.

Hi, my name is Mariella Hunt. I’m 18 years old and I’ve written 16 books (not including all the drafts I never finished!) My life has been very interesting so far. I’ve been able to travel a lot, especially to Peru–in fact, I’m there right now. The change of scenery has helped me with my stories, and I’ve discovered that the ocean is the heart of my writing right now. I’ve seen two worlds–quiet Boise, and, well, hectic Peru. I’ve met a whole bunch of people and seen awesome places. I am thankful for all my blessings right now. You’ll see me making references a lot to blog posts on my spiritual blog where I tell you what actually happened, because it’s been a journal for a long time. My life consists of writing and God. Nothing else.
Total weight gain: +13.5 total. This is +/-0 from last week. I think the baby has moved up just a bit, which, in turn curbs my insatiable appetite a bit. Which, in turns, curbs my weight gain. It’s so weird how I can gain 3 lbs. in one week and 0 the next. According to the weight gain calculator, I’m smack dab in the middle of below average and average gain, so I think I’m doing just fine.

Reflexology is a healing method that involves the manipulation of certain parts of the body to bring about balance. For laryngitis, the reflexology focus is on the throat, lung, chest, lymphatic system, and diaphragm points on both feet. Also recommended is manipulation of all points on the sides and bottoms of the toes.

I know that man tries to describe it in physical terms; the first heaven being the atmosphere, the space where birds fly and in that area man can breathe and exist. Then there is the second heaven, that area we call space, beginning with the sun, moon, and stars; and where we look to view the Milky Way, etc. Then man thinks physically, that the third heaven is that which is out beyond that great expanse.

I still wanted to have our conversation to talk about some rules, punishments, or at least a plan, but life got in the way last night. We did have some fun texting each other on the couch while the kids watched tv. He text me that he wants to clamp my nipples and put his dick in my ass. But I don't want him to ask - I want him to tell me to get the clamps and bend over...
If meaning is physically present somewhere or in something, it is present in the details and chaos. The meaning of life, if you will, is that chaos is the infinite sum of disparate coincidences that are a textbook example of perfection only on being integrated.

Next, they looked at crime, especially the fear of child abduction. They note that "rate of youth abduction is low in school areas." Only 4% of abductions take place near schools. Of course, most child abductions are custody disputes, one parent taking the child from the other parent. The abduction that everyone fears, the so-called "stranger danger" kind amounts to about 100 cases nationally per year, in comparison to 204,000 family abductions. There is another category which is called "nonfamily abduction" which is not considered the stereotypical "stranger danger" situation. But the Center for Missing and Exploited Children reports that "Nonfamily abduction victims overall were particularly concentrated among the oldest groups, with 59 percent being 15-17 years old." They also note that the "stranger danger" prevention misses the fact that "the majority of non-family abductions (53 percent) are abducted by persons known to the child: 38 percent of nonfamily abducted children were abducted by a friend or long-term acquaintance, 5 percent by a neighbor, 6 percent by persons of authority, and 4 percent by a caretaker or babysitter." While the stereotypical kidnappings are the most dangerous they happen in extremely small numbers. CNN reported that the number of stereotypical kidnappings "are small and getting smaller."

He's focused, determined, the four-time winner of the races and quite the horse whisperer. For someone who speaks the bare minimum, he's got so much to say. At the age of nineteen, he's probably maturer than the majority of the island.

"The nudity? We absolutely discussed it. It's crucial to that part of the genre, and we felt we had to honor the genre. You have these conventions for a reason, and the reason is bigger than just, "What do kids like?"

As always, you really cannot expect that 4 months of your life will all be on a high note, and that being said, it’s been a roller coaster of highs and lows, most of the lows being illness – head cold related, or over-training injuries, and the highs being great workouts, healthy nutrition, and an overall feeling of accomplishment and success.

When I was in NY a couple of weeks ago an entire flock of anabaptists were testifying in Washington Square Park, the men preaching arrogant, the women meek and silent dressed in their prairie chic. I kept on looking at the little girls. I stayed there forever and stared at the little girls, the squirming little girls, did they feel embarrassed, would they ever reach a higher consciousness, would that be possible. I recently also read the ghostwritten memoir of Carolyn Jessup, who was a child bride for the FDLS, and she wrote about the often admonition that girls not question and "keep sweet."

A great little trio from Austin, Texas. This instrumental track has a real urgency about it, and quite a 60's garage feel. The album (again, I didn't get it until last year) is a cracker, fusing Blues, 60's garage and rock all in one go!

I didn’t think John’s scheme was this well planned. I can’t believe he made sure they all got pregnant. This is a long plan in the making and it may be to late to stop it. I don’t think Diana should be so hard on Cassie. Cassie just lost her mother, then her grandmother was sent a way to get better and suddenly her father comes home out of the blue. She was just searching for family. Any 16-year-old girl would probably do the same. Diana still had her father, the one who raised her, so she didn’t need to go rushing into John’s arms. Cassie didn’t trust John at first. He earned her trust.

Satan no doubt uses discouragement to break us into believing that God doesn’t really care what happens to us and that in essence we aren’t a big deal to him. Sadly, we often succumb to these notions when nothing could be further than the truth.

Part of the difference between then and now is that the 1929 crash came on the heels of a spectacular bubble in Florida real estate, which crashed in 1925, and that followed another nasty little bubble and crash in the stock market in 1921; thus we’re only just now at the point where the idiocy of trying to get rich off bubbles should be sinking in. Another part of the difference is that the financial authorities in 1929 responded to the implosion of the bubble by letting investors crash and burn, where today’s basically wet themselves trying to make sure that investors don’t lose money, even if keeping them solvent means that the economy goes down in flames. Still, I think there’s more to it than that.

Due to the position of high-altitude wind currents circling earth, so far this winter has been much milder than average. But most native mountain folk know that some of our fiercest storms and deepest snows blow in during late February and March. With over a month until the Vernal equinox, there is still time, much time, to have a ‘decent’ winter, with storms of severe and delicate beauty worth remembering.

Harlow was amazing on the flight. true to form, she slept almost the entire way and then smiled through the landing. she barely even made a peep and charmed all of those around her. the first few days in Chicago she was great as well just as she was the first few days in Michigan. then all seemed to take a turn at the end of the Michigan stay. she was fussy, screaming all the time, starving, and clearly in pain when trying to eat. i chocked it up to teething but i think there may have been a yeast issue in there somewhere as well. regardless, it seems to have been a rough spell since that trip. while still a generally calm baby that takes things in thoughtfully (again, just like Papa) she has been much more fussy this fourth month. and much more demanding of what she wants. she is also going through a change in her sleeping habits. while she used to go to bed around 11pm and sleep right through until the next morning...she is now demanding to go to bed earlier each night and then waking up fitfully at all sorts of wee hours of the morning. sometimes she wakes up and i can feed her back to sleep. but, more increasingly, she wakes up and then just wants to lay between us and "talk" for a few hours. super cute but super tiring. also, i must say that we have swaddled since birth and i have feared the end of the swaddle since that time as well. i swear by it and know in the depths of my heart that that is why she has slept so soundly all of those months. now, she suddenly wants no part in it. girl wants to move and flail. we have decided that starting today there will be no more swaddle. yikes. yikes. and yikes. but we do have to make that transition. better now than later. and since she is asking for it, i suppose that means she is ready. i am also wondering if her swaddling as inhibited her development in learning to roll over. she still has no interest in rolling but is doing great sitting by herself and standing if you give her something to hold.
Honesty is one of the book’s selling points, according to the blurb, and it’s true that nobody would invent some of the things Baxter admits to thinking. But what impresses most is the concrete prose, the defining solidity of almost everything he says: no ambiguity here, no fine writing, just aesthetic delight throughout at what he says and how he says it, which borders on physical pleasure.

"The poem itself as we know it," writes Sayers, "would appear to have achieved its final shape towards the end of the eleventh century." She translated from a manuscript in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, which she says is "the oldest and best of all the versions." It contains 291 laisses, or divisions. In the Larousse books, the laisses are all in modern French, but with laisses 146-185 in the original Old French, which for me is a double treat.

I came across this article on homelessness and veterans. Apparently most of them are women. I know that most of the homeless people that I have met are women. Many of which are recently divorced. The homeless vets that I have met have all been men. Two of which were discharged because they had mental problems. I talked about the homeless vet before I am sure. He seems like a very nice man, but he has paranoid delusions and thinks the government is trying to poison him so he won't take his medication. Of course without his medications his life will never improve.
I’m going to start by examining Bob’s handling of the issue of biblical inerrancy and the Magisterium, in order to illustrate a pattern. Watch how it unfolds, with this question firmly in mind: Is this really all about the truth for Bob, as he claims, or is this really all about winning an argument at all costs?

and a SUPER powerful card - the High Priestess. The high priestess is sitting on a throne with a veil behind her. The veil has pomegranates, which are another sign of fertility. There is a black and white column on either side of her, which could mean good and evil. She holds the Torah in her hand, which is a powerful spiritual guide. This card reminds you to trust in your spiritual side. Don't give up easily even if your fist attempt fails. You have a great deal of power at your hands and you can use that to obtain your goals but you will have to do the work. This card also shows knowledge and passion, these are your guiding traits.

The Hanged Man, a member of the traditional pack, fits my purpose in two
A rather interesting piece of journalism caught my eye over at the Manchester Asian News today. It seems that in an attempt to butter (or should that be "ghee") up the local police force, "senior police officers", "members of the police authority and the police federation" and the local community were "invited", along with former Lord Mayor Councillor Afzal Khan and the consul general from the Consulate General of Pakistan in Manchester, Saif ur Rehman Khan, to "a bit of a do".

I would have loved to have been born the beautiful and outrageously stylish Daphne Guiness, personal friend of the late Alexander McQueen and Isabella Blow. By a quirk of birth, she happens to be an heiress with, I assume, nothing to spend her money on or do with her time but what she truly loves. And she loves fashion, buying and wearing. She's the same age as me, but different build, but if we lived in the same street, I'm sure we'd be best friends. One of the things I love is to sit on the beds of my best girl friends while they show me their favourite clothes, or latest buys. I did this on Saturday at my friend, Taryn's after we went to her friend's sculpture exhibition opening, (where I met a man in a very cool jacket, who told me it was made in Wellington in the 60s, which opened a conversation about style. He unbuttoned his jacket and showed me the amazing lining. I then admired his floral shirt. Well, I guess you had to be there.) Then after admiring Taryn's coat collection, she came over to my place and I showed her some of my favourite shoes. My other friend Monique is fabulous for shoes, she has some beauties. I just love looking at people's stuff.

I am so grateful for how well-received The Frosted Cake Shop has been over the last few years. Although the idea of an all custom cake shop is not entirely original, or limited to TFCS, I have strived to create the opportunity for my west-coast friends to have a one-of-a-kind, specialty cake of their own. When creating The Frosted Cake Shop, I envisioned meeting with clients, comparing color palettes, sketching designs, and pairing their favorite flavors to create their dream cake. Each cake would be tailored to the specific wants and needs of each client. No cake would be the same.

There’s no way Najib can hope to get away with it, not with the current level of maturity of the Malaysian populace and the international community’s growing refusal to tolerate political bullies. Just like Libya’s Gaddafi and Egypt’s Mubarak – Najib and UMNO will be forced to let go, one way or another.

Most new-wave ice-pop artisans acknowledge at least some debt to the paleta — a frozen fruit treat sometimes made with nuts, milk and spices that gained popularity along Mexico’s Pacific coast in the 1940s. Former pastry chef and Mexico City transplant Fany Gerson of La Newyorkina has a special connection to the confection: In fact, she’s publishing a book of recipes (titled “Paletas”) this month. There’s a store in the works, too, but for now, the best place to get ahold of her avocado, hibiscus or cajeta (caramelized goat’s milk) pops is her stall at the Hester Street Fair.

and on that note, i shall stop pontificating and get to the knitting. i am feeling more in control at work by setting some clear boundaries about my time and availability, but instead of just resting with that, i decided it was a good time to take on a knitters guild responsibility. apart from being co-secretary of my own guild group, i have offered to co-cordinate the sydney royal easter show feature display. this is not the competition part, its different. every year a particular craft gets a separate space to showcase its best work, hold displays, talk to the public etc. the knitters guild will be part of this display this year along with the handspinners and weavers and the machine knitters. its already started to be bigger than ben hur, and my spare computer time has been taken up this week with endless spreadsheeting and emailing. so much for taking things off the desk.

From this point on, the story of 'Bitter Greens' is inextricably interwoven with fiction and fantasy, complex as any braid of Rapunzel’s hair. There is Charlotte’s own personal history at the court of the Sun King. There is the tale of a Venetian courtesan and witch called Selena Leonelli, or La Strega Bella, who becomes the mistress of Titian and who prolongs her youth by drinking the blood of young virgins. And there is the tale of Marguerite, the child whom La Strega imprisons in the high tower.

Everything after that was blurry. I remember vomiting. I remember not wanting my ex-husband more than a foot, if that, away from me. I remember being asked if I wanted something for the pain, but I don't remember what I said. I know I didn't receive pain medication, but I just can't remember what I said. Then I remember being told it was time to push. I didn't believe them, because I'd read that women felt the urge to push when it was time. I had absolutely no urge to push, but I didn't want to argue. God knows what they would have done if I argued. An image of foreceps delivery came to mind. It scared the hell out of me. However, when the nurse said to push during the contraction, I got a bit of my spirit back. Surely she was joking, I thought. She wants me to push when it hurts the most. I stalled. One contraction went by, then another, and another. Still no urge to push. In all honesty I had no urge to birth anymore. I wanted to crawl into my own bed, pull the covers over my head and cry. I didn't do that though. I held my breath, chin to chest and pushed. Just like they told me to.
Suleman should be forced to undergo a full hysterectomy and prevented from future adoption of any more children. I personally would like to see all her children removed from the home until she undergoes a mental health examination to determine if she is mentally ill and incompetent to raise these children. My initial response is that she should have all her children taken from her and put up for adoption, especially the last 8, but let’s give her the benefit of the doubt and allow an independent professional to review her case. If we were talking about cats or dogs instead of children, the SPCA would have labelled her a “hoarder,” charged her with animal cruelty and immediately removed the animals from her home pending trial She appears to be obsessed with bearing children and possessing human property called children, not being a real parent. She needs psychiatric care, as do her crazy parents for supporting this obsession by not requiring her to support at least herself. I read that her mother has spoken out, saying that her daughter is not capable of raising this many children by herself. Who is? The sad part is that Suleman is a selfish woman who is dumping the real responsibility of raising all these kids on her parents — in fact, she planned it that way by her own admission, never considering the tremendous financial, physical and emotional burden and sacrifice she was asking of her parents, not to mention her own children, in order to fulfill her obsession.
The training moved on another level last week as we’re starting to get the trainees ready for interviewing very soon – the business team spent time with each of the trainees grilling them over mock interviews in order to test the trainees strengths and areas for development.

Building new and renewed lives for themselves but always as “Friends of CREATE”.

Today, however, we will conclude this sequence with examining what can be found on the Net relating to Nubian manuscripts. One should note that as Nubian manuscripts can be understood texts written (mainly) in Old Nubian, Coptic, and Greek (but also in Arabic and Ottoman Turkish) with various inks (but mainly coloured between brown and black), and on materials such as papyrus, parchment, leather, and paper. These manuscripts may have been discovered in any site dating to the medieval era of northern Sudan and southern Egypt, when this stretch of the Nile Valley that we call Nubia was ruled by the Christian kingdoms of Nobadia, Makuria, and Alwa. The following map indicates the sites where Medieval manuscripts have been found in Nubia:
He did believe that the Universe has purpose towards hyper-complexification, or advanced organization. He predicted it would occur faster and faster. “In this state there is an illusion which makes it appear as if Nature is tending towards something– towards caring.”

"The CEOs in big board rooms in Paris, in Zurich and New York don't normally think about people who are demonstrating in parks," says Dilenschneider, whose firm advises some of the biggest companies in the world.

But that won’t happen. At the end of the day, XML is just plain-text with angle brackets. Even if XML parsers won’t be around 50 years from now, plain-text probably will. And there will be somebody willing to create a custom conversion program for you. You can argue this point about most proprietary data formats, but most are not as copiously documented as XML.

. . . and yet there’s been nothing but radio silence from the mainstream media on this phenomenon.

And the wolf was confused at first, put on a trial, waiting to see if Jesus would lash out. Would Jesus bring down Holy fire from the heavens to wipe him out? Would Christ fight back? So the attack began, slowly at first. But it built, and as it built it became more brutal. Jesus took it. He stood there. He didn’t lash out. He didn’t defend Himself. He didn’t call down a heavenly host of angels. He didn’t wipe the wolf from existence. He let the wolf do his very worst unto Jesus’ death. And the wolf danced away, believing he had won. That the Messiah hadn’t been prepared for that kind of ‘worst’.

9. Love Unconditionally -Unconditional Love is a dynamic and powerful energy that lifts us through the most difficult times. It is available at any moment by turning our attention to it and using its wonderful potential to free us from our limitations. Loving unconditionally begins with ourselves, for without self-love, we cannot know what true love can be. In loving ourselves, we allow the feeling to generate within us and then we can share it with everyone and everything around us! That which we send out, returns to us in greater measure. If you have not thought about how you feel towards yourself, physically, mentally, and emotionally, or spiritually, I invite you to do so now. Begin the journey that changes everything. Begin the journey of unconditional love…and be Happily positive.
Everyone always say it is the worst day of the week – it’s my second favorite. I like Mondays, maybe it is the idea that it is the start of a new week of adventure, or the promise of actually doing something with my life ( even if that is spending hours drawing infinate elephants and debating movie quotes), I like Mondays. School is nice on Mondays, because everyone hates them, so by being cheerful, you become extra cheerful. Like extreme cheerful, altra happy , superawesomewickedsicktasticly cool ( yeah, I invented a word … it will catch on … maybe). I like to brighten peoples Mondays, whether it means thinking of something really funny, or putting on a cute face and bothering them till the smile. Otherwise they can be darn right boring ( as if I just used darn ..).

The actual mystery itself is actually fairly creative–it involves recent Russian history and it’s more time sensitive and compelling than the mystery in First Daughter. The villains and even some of the good guys are just complex enough, and there are some moments that are honestly shocking. While the pacing tends to knock it around a bit and it isn’t the best plot in the world, it’s actually interesting and much more epic than First Daughter.
It’s not your typical seasonal ale and I definitely don’t think it represents Winter; maybe Autumn. It’s really nice to be surprised by the labeling which originally gave me the impression that it would be a sickly sweet dessert beer. It is subtle, sweet but not too sweet and was a very nice beer, if I do say so myself. I put of swig of it in my Shepherds pie and drunk the rest. If this sounds like the beer for you, get in there quick as it won’t be around after early February.

In 1501 began a period of intense activity; he is in Florence, where he completed the sculpture of “David”, meanwhile, he also painted the “Battle of Cascina” and the “Doni Tondo“. In fact, in the autumn of 1504 Michelangelo was given the commission to paint the battle of Cascina (a battle between Florence and Pisa, which Florence won) intended to be a fresco on a wall of the “Palazzo della Signoria” as a companion piece to Leonardo’s “Battle of Anghiari”, but this project came to nothing: the cartoon was finished (at least in part, by February 1505) but an urgent summons from Pope Julius II prevented Michelangelo from continuing with the work, for which only some drawings survived.
But in 1925, Harry had a leggy teenage stage assistant who emerged from a large mock-up of a radio and did the Charleston. Dorothy Young was with the Houdini tour for little more than a year before she went on to a career in dance, onstage and in movies. Liz Taylor has monopolized the headlines this week (and rightly so) but I saw Young’s obituary in the Times and it spilled a new secret about Harry. Houdini swore Young to secrecy, to never to divulge any of behind-the-scenes preparations. And so there is much about the world’s greatest magician that will never be known. Dorothy Young, a shy seventeen-year old spotted by Houdini at a casting call, died last week at a retirement home in New Jersey. She was 103 years old. I hope she’s dancing right now with her partner, Gilbert Kiamie, in Rumbalero Heaven…where, I do believe, the magic never ends.

Dr. Colglazier has the following comments in anticipation of the retreat: “As many of you already know, one of my guiding mantras is that ‘The greatest glory to God is a human being fully alive.’ During this retreat experience, we will explore what it means to be alive to daily life. How do we nurture our creativity? How do we find peace in the midst of daily stress? How do we embrace the life we have in order to find the life we want? How do we find more joy and zest and energy for living? How do we discover more poetry in our daily living? And most of all, how do we discover the presence of God in daily experience? These questions and more will be explored during our retreat experience in Tuscany.”

Oliver has extensive experience working on valuation issues for private equity and venture capital funds, and firms back by PE or VC funding. He has a particular interest in the valuation of creative intellectual property, and recent assignments have included the development of mergers and acquisitions strategy at Boosey and Hawkes, the world’s largest classical music publisher (owned until recently by Hg Capital), and at Chorion (currently owned by 3i), which controls the literary estates of Agatha Christie and Enid Blyton. Before completing his MBA at London Business School, Oliver worked for ten years in the music industry. Between 1993 and 1999 he was a freelance classical record producer, working for most of the major labels, including BMG, Virgin Classics, EMI, and Warner Classics, and some of the most important independents. In 1996 he won a Gramophone Award for Best Selling Classical Album of the Year. Between 1999 and 2003 he was Chief Executive of the chamber orchestra Sinfonia 21.

There is a separate ‘party political’ debate to be had as to what the functions of both the civil service and the wider public sector should be – in particular regarding service delivery. The civil service isn’t the most perfect institution in the world. If it was, I probably wouldn’t have left it. The civil service needs to improve, but it also needs people to stand up for it at a time when few others will.
