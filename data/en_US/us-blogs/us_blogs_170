Among friends, I'm famous for such encounters, and for challenging people's reluctance to accept that the 'Arab' and 'Jewish' communities can have anything in common. At Birmingham University, I had countless encounters with cabbies who would lecture me on Middle Eastern politics. "It was the West that murdered Saddam, he was a great leader," said one driver. I replied that I couldn't agree since countless Iraqi people - my Jewish grandfather included - were tortured under Hussein's rule.
The head aches and nausea seem to increase when I'm, off course, hungry so I started to think a bit and try to pin point what IS really wrong with me?
I went to tour the campus of the school for a couple of reasons. One being that I wanted to get myself excited about going to a four-year school and two, I wanted to see where the pool was so I had somewhere to swim this summer. Before the tour started, we all had to introduce ourselves because we are now going to be the best of friends for all of time and eternity just because we all went to this tour.
Now that already feels to me like a pebble well placed.

The comedy is very broad and exaggerated, which while common with Asian audiences might be out of step with more subtle American tastes. Think of it as a Hanna Barbera cartoon without the intellectual undertones. It’s not for children though – but some of the set pieces would definitely appeal to less sophisticated senses of humor.

The next day, Yi Gak gets Tae Yong’s phone fixed and retrieves its password. He looks through the album that appears to only have six photos and gets evidence that Tae Mu had met him in New York. It’s time for him to get his Sherlock Holmes on so he does some investigating. The photos are dated February 17th and Park Ha tells him she was supposed to meet him on February 18th (Happy birthday, Sis!) so he deduces that Tae Yong must have been murdered sometime in between.

Last Saturday there were supposed to be some really bad tornado's. The National Weather alert sent out a 24 hour advance notice, which was only the 2nd time in history. The news said there would be high-end, life threatening tornado's. We prepared, we got everything we needed in our basement and prepared to hunker down. NOTHING happened. There was heavy rain for maybe 3 minutes but other than that, it was just a gloomy day. We still spent most the afternoon in the basement and I caught this photo. Addie was watching a movie and Avonlea saw her and of course had to lay exactly like her. She sure loves her older brother and sister.

By now, many of us already know that God (insert Universe/Source/Your Divinity here) has a plan for us and when we surrender to him/her/it/ them it allows us to become more in alighnment with it. My personal belief is that God is a direct reflection of my soul….he’s one of the voices of my soul. So when I say God has a plan, I don’t believe that it is some separate being who hangs out in the clouds with a book in his hand. I don’t see him pointing down at earth and saying “Robin, working in the insurance industry is NOT what you came here to do.” Instead, I experience events that cause me to leave the business….kicking and screaming the whole time. It would have been a heck of a lot easier if I had just let go. If I paid attention to the signs and gently exited…surrendered. Instead, I was doing what I was “supposed” to do…I was married, had kids, and brought home a decent paycheck. I knew of no other way.

Msgr. Jeffrey Steenson, who was installed as ordinary of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter on Feb. 12, said the planning for the program of study for these men began late in the spring of 2010 and is based on a document prepared specifically for former Episcopal clergymen by the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. This was in turn based on Pope John Paul II’s pastoral exhortation Pastores Dabo Vobis (I Will Give You Shepherds) on preparing men for the priesthood. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith document is the basis for course preparation in both the U.S. and the U.K. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, papal documents, and other assigned readings are the backbone of the studies in both countries.
Dear Planetary Astronomer Mike,
The real trick comes next. At some point, S1 decides to relocate (at least on paper) its headquarters to Bermuda, which has no income tax. The company becomes a “dual resident,” which means that, from the Irish point of view, it’s subject to Bermuda tax law, but from the U.S. perspective, it’s still incorporated in Ireland. To complete the scheme, the parent company then sets up a second Irish subsidiary (S2), which, importantly, chooses not to beconsidered a corporation under U.S. law; this has the effect of hiding its finances from the IRS. Why are two Irish subsidiaries better than one? Because now S1 can license the parent company’s products to S2 in exchange for a stream of hefty royalty checks. This means that S2 can collect all the income, and be taxed by Ireland at a relatively low rate of 12.5 percent (compared to 35 percent in the United States). But the royalties it’s paying to S1 can be deducted from its income. In the end, S2 doesn’t have to pay that much in taxes, and the “royalties” that make their way to S1 are tax-free.

Being so close to it I can’t always be objective. The process of sharing the journey with others as difficult as it sometimes is has lead me to one realisation: I cannot write this novel alone. This is something I didn’t know before. And to be honest, to be questioned about something I have created only to realise I have not completed it as well as I might have or could have, is a difficult thing. To have input from others is the basic structure of business isn’t it? Someone to oversee things and to ensure the job is done right.
Overall, I was a bit disappointed. The tap selection wasn’t as extensive as I’d been led to believe. Well, yes, they did have a ton of barleywines -- 31 in fact, which were the remnants of 60 they had for the recent Hard Liver BW Festival, most priced at $5 for 6oz. and $7 for 12oz. Who should complain, right?

If he becomes the President of India, the first thing he will do is introduce the same concept of franchising into the politics as well. Unlike IPL, this political franchises will have state wise teams. This means the number of Indian states will equal the number of political teams. Each team will be known by the name of the state it represents and not by the name the respective franchise owners choose for their respective teams.Each team will comprise of twenty five politicians from the state the team comes. International politicians will not be allowed to be a part of any team.
Yes, there have been many, many more books that have shaped me in some way over the years, but these are the ones I call to mind the most often. Thank you, authors, for providing me with such a range of intellectual growth and emotion.

A rare but very real chance for one of these teams to reach a cup final. This might not be Cardiff’s last chance of reaching Wembley this season, although they’ll still be hoping to gain automatic promotion to the Premier League rather than finish in the play-offs. A play-off position is probably just out of reach for Crystal Palace this season, although a trip to Wembley in the guise of the Carling Cup final is very much within their grasp.

In the end, I just deleted it. No response, no confrontation, nothing. Why? Because, I realized that giving any attention to this petty b.s. would have given this woman even more power – and, after all, that’s what this was all about, right? Her slighting my work made her feel powerful; she tried to break my spirit, hurt my self-esteem, and make me feel bad, all because she didn’t like what I had to say. And, any type of negative response on my part would have just validated her statement.

However, even to Kenny Dalglish and Liverpool FC, £500 million-plus is hardly loose change. Moreover, most of what relatively little criticism there has been of the package came, significantly, only after the announcement of Greater Manchester’s deal, whose ‘earn back’ tax provision – the first allowing local government to take directly a slice of national taxes – was rightly acknowledged as a genuinely ground-breaking policy innovation.

This time through, I was impressed by Sam’s loyal friendship towards Frodo. Sam kept his promise to Gandalf to never leave Frodo. He was willing to travel with him to ends of the earth (or Middle Earth), even to the fires of hell (or in this case, Mount Doom). He watched Frodo’s back and protected him from the attack of ring wraiths, evil octopi, orcs, Gollum, and even himself when Frodo was tempted to give in and put on the ring. Sam confronted Frodo and spoke truth about Gollum’s deceptions. He stayed by his side through thick and thin. Sam helped Frodo accomplish an impossible task. He even put Frodo on his back and carried him when Frodo’s strength gave out. And above all, Sam spoke words of hope and encouragement when the journey grew difficult and Frodo was ready to give up.

What the alcohol incident (and official reaction) represent is the fact that though sometimes things go wrong, we cannot accept that anymore.

And then we try to “fix” them, even if there’s very little, if anything, to fix. It’s almost as if we have come to believe that if we just plug every pinhole in the universe, we will all be absolutely safe and sound forever more.
Miri. That shut my mouth. “That’s a name, not a designation,” I said obviously. That meant that they were from somewhere up in the hills, from a hidden enclave. These kids hadn’t been engineered, they’d been born. Not to a Reproductive, but to a mother. Probably had a father too. There were people they cared about, and that cared about them. It hit me in the gut. I had assumed that everyone who came would have a designation that didn’t quite suit them. I thought they’d all be looking ahead, thinking any new life would be better than the one CA had engineered them for.

Ah, New Jersey and your lax liquor laws (as compared to Pennsylvania). It's great to spend time in a state that has independently run liquor stores, especially the kind that can sell all types of alcoholic beverages. It is in one of these little gems I found myself on Thursday night (on my way to meet said college buddy). I guess it's the fact that there's not a store on this level within 30 miles of my home that I still get all giddy walking through the doors. At this moment the true name of the store escapes me, but I'm sure "Discount" and "Wines" were in there somewhere.

A Final Observation……
By combining the Peninsula and West House trails into a single day hike (3.8 miles roundtrip), you can put together a rewarding outing that offers a much more diverse hiking experience than either trail offers separately. The Peninsula Trail is a relatively flat path, which follows the shoreline of Lake Townsend. The West House Trail, by contrast, goes through some hilly woods before briefly following a ridge overlooking the lake. It then re-enters the woods before intersecting with a dirt road, overgrown with grass, just before the back of the Lake Jeannette subdivision. Here are a few highlights:

So if you ever meet her next time in person, go talk to her or even introduce yourself to her. She's definitely a celebrity blogger in my eyes as she is not arrogant or what so ever. Plus if you listen to what she's going to be doing soon, her story will definitely inspire you to follow your dreams.
While my mom was always the comforter and the one who was there for us when we were hurt or scared or sad or mad, for some reason the only person I wanted was my dad.

And my arm was falling off. I can’t be trusted with the details.)
Alex met "Bad Dad" the first evening as he tried to get some work done on the terrace. Bad Dad pulled up a chair and started practicing his so-so English. Beers happened. Then shots happened. After the first shot, Alex said he didn't want another because he was trying to get some work done. Bad Dad scoffed and said, "NO. We have an expression in Germany -- 'you can't stand on just one leg.' You must have two." Alex replied he's able to stand on one leg just fine, but not after he's done two shots.

Though not present at the seminar, the name of the College of Law’s chief executive was frequently bandied around, and not usually in a complimentary way. It is fair to say that the noble Savage has become something of an Aunt Sally.
As reported here ... Councillor Rams had claimed, in a tweet to the London Standard, that here in Broken Barnet there was no 'bleak future' for libraries as 'new libraries' have been built, with longer opening hours. This was from the man who has just shut a library in a Labour ward on the grounds of cost, while agreeing to subsidise a ridiculous toytown library in the extremely affluent and Tory area of Hampstead Garden Suburb, and at the same time failing to produce the new provision of library services he has promised would be available in North Finchley's Arts Depot.

During my big adventure to the big city, I knew I would need to be intentional about how to cart my children around. I had injured my back the week before and was on heavy medication... steriods, some other anti-inflammatory, and a muscle relaxer. Oh and pain killers for night time. I did not want to risk hurting my back worse during my trip. Had I been healthy, most likely the preferred method of transporting my one-year-old might have been to front-pack (or back-pack) him. I have a carrier that I really love called a Beco, and the way it distributes the weight on the hips allows for longer wearing than some of my other carriers.

Worst of all, Oborne and Warsi portray themselves as defenders of Muslims when in truth by portraying the valid criticism of the conduct of some Muslim factions as bigotry they strengthen the hand of the most aggressive elements within Islam. The real problem is that there is a great battle going on for the heart and soul of Islam. The faith is bitterly divided between factions with incompatible views. Some are quick to use force, including bloodshed, and their main victims are Muslims who came to the West to get away from medieval sharia law and the intimidation that goes with it. We have all been shocked to learn that beatings and murders in the name of ‘honour’ have been carried out in our midst. And we have all been discomfited to discover that some Muslim schools teach animosity to the West and promote sectarianism.
The padding in my current tri-shorts is pretty shot. I’m a little sore today. Of course, some of that may be because I was riding my road bike on crushed limestone which is like driving a car with no shock absorbers on a cobblestone road. Oh, and there were hills. Major hills. My glutes and quads were shredded when we got done.

When I got home, I took a nap (with all the Assyrian floating around in my brain). Then headed off with John, Mary, Henry, and Stacy to our team meeting. We have the funniest team ever. Zander wanted us to sing along to his "drumming," so we all launched into a song (that Zander didn't know). A snapshot of the moment would've revealed six adults belting out "I've Been Working on the Railroad." We struggled to remember all the lines, but by the second time through we had it down. Now how often do you get a group of adults singing kids songs? Shows what happens when you are immersed in an ESL community! :) We had a nice summery meal. Lisa made a fruit salad and a cajun bulgur salad; Julie made red pepper hummus; and Mary made pretzels! We topped it off with lemon bars for dessert and a devotional that looked at the depths of creation (and all the new discoveries they are making at the bottom of the ocean). We ended the night with our Skype call to Dave and Lisa and taxied home.

In March 1967 the Torrey Canyon, a tanker carrying 120,000 tons of crude oil, ran aground on the Seven Stones Reef off Cornwall and the Scilly Isles. The Torrey Canyon was a US built ship owned and operated by a subsidiary of the Union Oil Company of California. The Captain, Pastrengo Rugiati, who was held responsible for the navigational error which caused the disaster, was an Italian recruited by Consulich, agents for Union Oil.

I couldn’t fit this into one scan, but if you look carefully you can piece together the composition with Beauty sitting at the table and the Beast lurking just around the corner. The Provensens have used the gutter between the pages to emphasize the corner in the image. The images aren’t merely frightening, they are brilliant and frightening. The hands of the beast are huge and clawed, yet they hang awkwardly, giving you the idea that in an unfortunate fumbling manner they might accidentally rip your arm off.

But I´m already loving it here too. There are so many amazing people here in Santa Cruz. I´m already super excited for this transfer and the investigators that the sisters have been teaching. Cristiane is 25 years old and lives with her boyfriend, Guilherme, is studying psychology and she is amazing!! I think the sisters found her cutting grass in front of her apartment and starting talking to her about the church...and she´s become our best friend ever since! She comes to church every week and is reading the Book of Mormon a lot and is just one of those happy people that are good to be around. I love her already! On Friday night she came with us to a ward lasagna party....Cristiane, Sister Dangerfield and I got to be the judges and be the first to test the different lasagnas. Mmmm...they were amazing...first place was a chicken and chili lasagna with a white cheesy sauce on top. It reminded me A LOT of Mom´s chicken enchiladas.

Gingerbread was Cohn’s debut novel. There are a few issues, of course, but Cohn’s witty brilliance definitely shines through, and with Cyd Charisse she’s created a character that you will love to hate at first, appreciate and understand later (Shrimp is definitely more fleshed out than Gingerbread), and maybe even love by the end of the trilogy (don’t know, still need to read Cupcake). Still prefer the collaborations with David Levithan, though…

George Thomas Hine was chosen as Architect and produced a compact arrow layout consisting of six blocks of wards and the usual facilities including combined recreation hall and chapel in the centre of the south elevations. Other accomodation included a nurse's block to the west, lodge cottage, terraced cottages for married attendants, a Superintendents residence, Isolation Hospital, and a villa block which was added in 1902. The administration block is notable for it's unusual triangular plan. The building was designed on a compact arrow plan and constructed from red brick with stone dressings and slate roofs with distinctive caps over the bay windows, characteristic of Hine's early commissions.
Here is an idea or three: first off, we have a diaspora of Russian born persons, of various ages, of some twenty million.

Happy New Year and what better way to bring in 2012 is a classic Kinks concert from over 30 years ago. It's from a FM broadcast so the sound is perfect and the era is circa, One For The Road on the later part of the Low Budget tour. The setlist includes 2 songs from Dave Davies first solo album (AFL1-3603) and the title track of their next album, Give The People What They Want. This is another show that has been available as a bootleg in various carnations with edited tracks, but to my knowledge this is the complete show.
Speaking of noise, she has destroyed my hearing. I'm sure of it. She is SO FREAKING LOUD. You literally cannot have a conversation if she is screeching, unless you can lip read. Her happy noises, discontent noises, surprised noises, exploring noises, ALL of them are SO LOUD! Certainly, no one is ever going to take advantage of this little girl, or coerce her into doing anything she's not sold on. She might lead others down the path to the river and jump into the rapids, but she won't be following. That's good, right? She's one intense kid.
RSPCA chief inspector Lee Hopgood said: "Some of the traders in puppies at these events are not simply selling an accidental litter of puppies, many of them are breeding and selling dogs purely for profit.

Saul allowed the stoning of Stephen and after wards, “Christ met Saul on the path to his darkest, most devious sin.” In Acts 9, we discover that Saul gathered letters to take to the Synagogues in Damascus to locate any followers of “The Way,” and bring them back as prisoners of Jerusalem. His intent was to bring the believers under the authority of the Sanhedrin for either acquittal or death.

I have discussed the merits of this test with a few F1 journalists and two of the teams participating. The generally accepted opinion has been that these tests are useful, perhaps more for some than others. As one journalist simply put it, “a free test is always beneficial though, even if the result is only a minor upgrade/change”. Although the test wasn’t actually “free” in monetary terms, it was a free in terms of opportunity. The way this season is shaping up, with no clear leader, this test has been crucial for teams to test some components and configurations before the start of the Euro rounds.

But, snow also meant making snow forts and playing street hockey with my brother. It meant getting my first pair of authentic moccasins and knowing how warm you can feel with good snow gear. The first snowfall was a sign that Christmas was around the corner, well, some years it mean Halloween was almost here. But, when Christmas finally came, it meant bundling up after our Ukrainian Christmas Eve dinner and as a family, walking off the calories in preparation for our Midnight dinner. And it was often one of those nights where the snow just sparkled. You haven’t seen snow until it sparkles like that in the evening light. Like a million stars at your feet. Beautiful!

I’m planning on spending some quality time at the library this weekend, so hopefully I’ll get some real progress made.

Also, I started an experiment! I bought L'Oreal Eyelash Serum. It's supposed to make your eyelashes longer and give you more! You put it on at night after you take off your makeup, and in the morning before putting on mascara. I've heard reviews of people saying they don't like to put it on under their mascara cause it clumps, but I've seen no problems with mine. I guess it depends on what mascara you use! It says that you will see results in 3 weeks.

To start with, I’m short. The reason I mention this is that there was a very tall gentleman that had become interested in me some years back. We had friends in common in our little academic environment and I often would run into him at functions on campus. His rather intense stare across rooms would be coupled with a shy hesitancy and obvious nervousness when in close proximity and, frankly speaking, I should have been flattered. However, and I apologize for my lack of metric abilities, my 5’3″ to his 6’6″ height was, to me, laughable. I love to dance and all I could think of was that there would never be a step stool around when necessary. But, I soon eliminated any possibility of this becoming an issue on the day he finally approached. He walked across a conference room, loomed over me and said, “I wanted to tell you that I’ve been admiring you from a distance.” To which I replied, “well, isn’t that the only way you could?” Problem solved, his crush was over.

It is no surprise that a manifesto against majoritarianism would not find favor with the mission of most American publishers. Opposition to mass society was once an accepted (indeed, unremarkable) theme in the richly layered works of iconic conservatives such as Edmund Burke, Russell Kirk, and James Burnham. Today, by contrast, such opposition is considered as damning as it is impolitic.

This domed example in the middle of the Wiltshire village of Shrewton is known locally as the Blind House, from its lack of windows.

Bad Day at Black Rock was based on the short story "Bad Time at Hondo" by Howard Breslin.
“If I hear something bad about someone, I never believe it. If it comes to the point that I have no choice but to believe it, I do not delight in it.” I’m not entirely sure what it is about us as humans that makes us crave and delight (cf. Proverbs 18.8) in hearing of the failings of others. It likely stems from our own insecurities, and our tendency to feel better about ourselves when we see the shortcomings of others. But that craving and delighting is all closely related to the sin of gossip, which is a topic that the Bible has an awful lot to say about.
Now Blair says that the 2004 Hunting with Dogs Act was a mistake.

This presentation will focus on the 2010 State of the Nation – the third annual survey of K-12 distance education in Canada. This year’s report documents similar trends in the regulation of K-12 distance education from previous years (e.g., British Columbia continues to have the most extensive regulatory regime). Additionally, Canadian teachers’ unions continue their cautious support of the use of distance education in the K-12 environment. All thirteen provinces and territories continue to use distance education within their K-12 systems, although in many instances the method of delivery is still using print-based materials. At present K-12 distance education enrolment is estimated to be between 150,000 and 175,000 students. This presentation will unpack some of these trends and expand upon each of the provincial and territorial profiles.

What happens when researchers account for the effect of socioeconomic context on intelligence? Eric Turkheimer-- a professor at the University of Virginia-- and his colleagues tackled this very question by examining the intelligence of twin pairs raised in very different socioeconomic backgrounds. The researchers reasoned that if the socioeconomic environment matters little for intelligence, then genetic differences between twins on intelligence measures should be small.
A new place opened up down the street, so we went to check it out. A very sketchy, scary bar got closed down and they renovated the bar room and turned it into a very cute jazz club.

The amazing number of newly minted constitutional experts which have shown up in the past couple of years should be making my heart go pitter-pat. Alas, not so much. It would be fair to say the only part of the First that gets much attention from these shining examples of American Exceptionalism is the misguided interpretation of free speech. The rest of it is of no use to them, as it can be disruptive to their cause and disturb the closely held belief that the Founders were Tea Party types. Not the Boston version.
The market today demands phones which have every feature from Music to Internet to Email to Camera. A phone should be able to do every job for the customer. And this is where Nokia has failed miserably and spectacularly. Its eventual collapse could be a case study for business schools in the near future. But that’s for a different day. Nokia is being severely beaten at the top from HTC, Samsung, Apple etc. while at the bottom its business is being eaten up by Spice, Lava, GFive, Karbonn, Micromax, Huwaei etc. Samsung recently crossed Nokia as the top most mobile vendor for the first time in 14 years. The collapse is imminent. But wait. What about my experience?

3:13-14 – In preparation of this commentary, I’ve done some reading into EOC Christology. It seems that the salvific act of Christ was not merely the cross in their teachings, but the act of living out the human experience itself; I liken it to a magnetic attraction where the magnet draws closer to the metal. Here, Theophylact posits that Jesus’s baptism wasn’t necessary, yet He did so in order to set the example for those who would follow and baptize in His name. Theophylact reads John’s refusal not as being in light of the High Christology of the earlier verses, but as a simple reflection of sin: Why should I, John, a sinner, baptize you, Christ, a non-sinner? I bear the sin of Adam, and you are pure. The holier washes the less-holy, and not the other way around.
See there are lots of opportunities every day to stop and talk with someone or go out of your way to ask about someone in need. The thought that holds me back is, but I don't have anything to give. A quick word and smile just don't seem like enough. But a smile with a batch of muffins, now that's a reason to go, a reason to stop, a reason to speak.
Jack and Kate moments were sparse throughout the series. They were ambiguous, they were often silent, and viewed on their own, the answer to whether they indicated any romantic feelings between the characters was highly subjective. Take an early scene in the first season, where Kate approaches Jack on the beach, tells him that she wants him to know what she did, only for him to refuse her, saying that "We should all be able to start over." They look at each other, and share a melancholy silence as they sit on the beach side by side. That's it. Or another moment, where Kate catches Jack looking at her while she is collecting seeds, and they share the infamous, but ultimately arbitrary, "guava seed" moment. Their first kiss was about desperation, confusion, and anger - but not necessarily romantic passion. When they get together for a brief period of time it is more symbolic to portray the characters in a certain way, rather than graphic and fulfilling for their long-suffering fans. Jack and Kate's scenes are tender, they are underplayed, there is more going on in the characters' heads than their actions portray - which is very in tune with Vogt's description of the "hint of a soft whisper, the briefest of caress, or a stolen look of desire" type of romance. These scenes stand in sharp contrast to heavily suggestive Sawyer/Kate scenes, which are all very sexually charged, and often times include intimate physical interaction - for example one of their first scenes together where Sawyer grabs Kate's arm and pulls her close, when they strip down and swim in the jungle spring, their subsequent game of I Never and of course their later passionate kisses and graphic sex scenes.

I am sad and mad and my fight or flight is always raring to go. I have opinions directed at me from every which direction, either from what is said or unsaid. I am in the middle of trying to find quality care for my health, both physical and mental, and I feel like I am self diagnosing because I can't find a Dr. who can take some actual time and do their job.

So I will rave about the Moomins. Just in case you don't know them, they are a family of cuddly and intriguing trolls, created by the Finnish author Tove Jansson back in the 1940s and still delighting children and adults all over the world (including me) today.
Side B starts with Motus Vita Est from Yugoslavia. Tracks from their demo tape. Released an album on Sacro Egoismo in 1990.

That said, what I feel that I need to find in the Jewish counterpart are examples on individuals or groups, having some clear defined principles and methods on defining them, which makes them apart from other similar individuals and/or groups, which then created a precedent for a continued tradition formed around these principles.
The concept is simple really. For example, when ABC was at my house filming, they asked me, "Do you fight with your kids to do their homework every night?"
Hope you have a great weekend. Next week I'll be hitting the pavement in freezing cold New York city looking for some fabulous things to bring home for Black & Spiro and for a couple of exciting projects I am working on. I must say I am very excited!!

I wasn’t sure that I wanted to buy Bloodshot. I tried to read one of Cherie Priest‘s steampunk books — Boneshaker — a while back but only managed to get about halfway before losing interest. I’ll likely try it again at some point; it’s a well written story but it just couldn’t hold my attention at the time. In any case, though, it made me hesitant to invest in Bloodshot. In the end, though, I did order it and I’m very glad that I did since Bloodshot is a lot of fun, due in no small part to Raylene’s charm.

Tali has definitely hit the "trying twos." "No" has been her favorite word and she's been very spunky and argumentative. She is very verbal and I am amazed by the number of songs she knows and can sing. She is doing some potty training. I'd like to just put away the diapers and get her trained but I'm not prepared to deal with poopy accidents in underwear. No fun! She goes potty on the toilet quite a bit and has gone #2 once or twice. She had been in disposables since Julia was born and when I finally started doing cloth with her again she complained that they were too big. Ha, ha! That's a good reason to get potty trained, Honey!

Hi~ Dear Fans, hello everybody, I’m EXO-M’s Kung Fu Little Panda Tao! haha
Then in April, I will publish firstly a fantasy romance that is currently sitting on my computer. Like the medieval novel was, this is an old thing, written several years ago. It needs some work, but not too much. So I think I can slip it in around all my other stuff, by April. I already have a cool cover image on hand for it. Like the medieval novel, it doesn’t really fit my greater authoring goals…but it’s a fun read (potentially). I’m thinking I’ll publish it at $2.99 and just let it sit there and do what it will. Just add some extra padding to my “bookshelf.”
Add all three = Awesome.
With many organisations now realising that the knowledge and competences needed to compete in a 21st century workplace includes "soft" skills such as creativity and innovation, critical thinking, communication and collaboration, it would seem that the Museum has found a real role to help develop the workforce of the future at an age where they haven’t even started thinking about their first job. The question for me is whether we could set up something similar in Wales? We already have the groundbreaking Techniquest to help children develop a better awareness of science and engineering but could we also do the same for encouraging creativity? The Museum in San Francisco would love to help and collaborate but I think we could also be more engaged with organisations in Wales to make this happen.
The foreign national’s pay must be equal to or more than the state workforce agency’s prevailing wage determination.

An annuity is an investment option that offers an insurance component to individual investors. Annuity investments get their name because the investor has the ability to convert their investment into a set of periodic income payments (an annuity) either over the investor’s life or over a set number of years.

Perhaps the greatest act of political and moral courage involving RAND was Daniel Ellsberg’s release to the public of the secret record of lying by every president from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Lyndon Johnson about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. However, RAND itself was and remains adamantly hostile to what Ellsberg did.

At just over two years old, ARIA has already become a luxurious trend-setter in Las Vegas’ CityCenter. Embodying the very essence of the city—culinary prowess, exhilarating entertainment, seductive nightlife, and the swankiest suites—this LEED Gold-certified wonderland rises far above the competition.
There's already been quite a bit of reaction to this, so before everyone gets too excitable, I would like to make a few things clear.
The only autobiographical entry in my list, and definitely my favourite non-fiction read of the year. I came across this on Twitter early on in its life, thought I'd give it a go, and laughed my socks off. If there's a bible for the New Feminism, then this is it. Also, I'm entirely with Moran in the matter of the awfulness of high heels. This is definitely my most-given-away book of 2011 (to date I've bought 18 copies*), and Lovely Daughter and friends are all talking about it as well - it's definitely polarised opinion among the teens in my life. This is one I shall return to many times. (*Caitlin - where's my commission?!)
- I shaped my rolls three different ways, shown above. The first was knotting the dough (roll on the left in the picture above), which was a bit tricky, but gets easier with practice. I also used a roll stamp, but even though I pressed very hard to make as deep an impression with the stamp as I could, the pattern turned out very faint (see middle roll, above). The third technique I used was folding or pleating the edges of circle of dough into the center (see the roll on the right, above).
So I have three words for you, my friend:
The day in between had been better. No pastry for me today, instead an old adversary raised its head again - gelatin, of the powdered variety. On the face of it three relatively straightforward dishes, a Smoked and Fresh Salmon Rillette, Cardamom and Youghurt Cream, and filled Chocolate shells. The fact that I had to make Lemonade meant that I would have the Stock Syrup that I would need for the filled shells so one technique was already there as a bonus.
I remember talking to the person in charge of adding maths resources to EEVL whose husband happened to be a maths lecturer. I asked her if her husband found the maths part of EEVL of use. The answer was “Not in the slightest. He is researching topics which are far too specific for finding resources by searching EEVL, and in any case he knows most of the other researchers who are involved in his topics, and simply follows their journal and conference papers.”

which I finally laid out in alternate directions, and added a double border and scrappy binding to create a quilt measuring about 30" x 40". It's for sale in the shop at the moment, and is backed in purple fleece and quilted in a free-style wavy line pattern that is my new favourite "easy to do" quilting design!
Paul was confined to the boat, surrounded by men of the world. He was a prisoner ofRome, a captive with little or no hope for physical deliverance. He did not belong toRome. He belonged to Jesus Christ. He would serve Jesus Christ by relaying God’s message to those on board the stricken vessel. He was proclaiming that he belonged to God.
After only a few days of doting upon and thoroughly spoiling our little agricultural child, we were astonished at his growth! Perhaps what they say about plants is true: you love them and treat them as part of the family and they flourish. We felt so proud of our little Manny, and were planning for a bigger pot which would inevitably be in his future.
Troy: Yes, and boys get hooked on pornography easily. Usually, what happens is, a boy finds his dad’s collection of magazines or videos. The problem with guys is that we don’t have to have a lot of product to get hooked on it. We are visual. When we see provocative or sensual images, there is a certain chemical that is released into our minds. Eventually, it takes more and more stimulation to create the secretion of that hormone, so we move on to harder and harder things.

My response to this was along the lines of 'of course there are errors - but if you take the thing as a whole, it's a great piece of work'. This was (mis)interpreted by some as me saying that errors didn't matter, and the pursuit of truth, of fact, in beer history was unimportant.
I like New York best in the rain. At least, I do when it rains. It was a good walk. There was a peace that only comes from cold rain, being completely taken care of, and staring at beautiful architecture. St. John the Divine is one of those cathedrals that looks too detailed and noble not to be alive. Perhaps I’m imagining things, but it seemed that everyone I passed looked at me and smiled. Perhaps I looked as happy as I felt. More likely, I had a giant bug perched on my nose.

You can’t talk yourself out of being cramped and seasick. Or homesick or headachy or out of clean clothes or cash. You can’t power through it. You can’t elbow your way around it or beg it to go away. You can admit it, embrace it, and settle in. This too shall pass, and maybe there will be a funky, happy, horsey byproduct when it does. Or at least you’ll be more comfortable in your seven by two when it’s all said and done.

There has been this month very little emphasis on meter, and that is because despite a number of poetry courses I have never really been able to get to grips with it much outside of a partially-intuitive de-DUM-de-DUM when attempting iambic prose or the like. Trochees, spondees and so on are far, far beyond my remit.
I won’t even try to come up with a coherent report about what the Seminar covered or explicating further on the theme — keep an eye on the Seminar’s always-expanding Audio Archives for recordings of individual sessions. Here, instead, is an episodic report of stuff I heard that I thought was interesting (and short) enough to jot down in my notebook.

Quite often it is good old local food which can make a big difference for expats missing their home. It has the power to bring back happy memories of socialising with friends and family in familiar surroundings and is particularly nice for those individuals who may be feeling a bit lonely. It can also satisfy a craving that has been nagging at the back of your mind.
Say what you will about the 80's and the musical/dress choices of the decade, but let's be honest, there's something magical and impossibly sexy about cruising around to these sounds (see album art for details). I'm fairly certain that wind literally caresses your hair when you press play, you can't say that about most albums these days. Regardless, you should grab this album and keep it stored away for your next road trip. Or shopping trip.

I have loved this film since the first time I've watched it. It helps that the intro of the movie shows American muscle cars (my favorite) driving to Aerosmith's "Sweet Emotion" (hey, my favorite band!) Once again, the soundtracks are perfect (I have both) if you love 70s classic rock. And even though I was definitely nowhere near being alive in the 70s, I can appreciate all the retro in this 90s film and the young Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck. Good tunes, cool cars, and an all around groovy movie!
I do not place the blame squarely on the kids. I think that they are besieged by unimaginable pressures: six to seven courses, homework, co-curricular activities, sports, training, social life, and family obligations. Add to the mix that their ability to focus is compromised by texting, instant messaging, Facebook, Skype, video games, movies-on-demand, and the seductions of the internet and you have young adults who are overwhelmed. In some ways, the "Control-F" approach to life gives them a sense of control: by searching for one thing, and one thing only, they can limit the amount of material they have to sift through. "Control-F" is a powerful tool (I use it frequently in trying to locate particular quotes) but it also threatens to frustrate an essential component of the learning process: the adventure of sifting and navigating through texts and, while doing so, experiencing one's mind and heart being opened by the discoveries made.

You may recall that we are playing musical rooms at our house. We're pulling the old switcheroo and turning our loft from the kids TV area to my office. By doing so, we had to move the TV downstairs to the living room. That called for a bit of an update to that room. So, we've been working on that for the last little while. The room should be ready for its big reveal tomorrow, but today I wanted to give you a little sneak peek.

Instead of making a 10 x 15" cake I scooped equal portions of the cake batter into greased and floured 12 regular size muffin tins. I had some batter left over so I filled 12 regular size cupcake papers half way with the rest of the batter. I'll tell you why I did that in a bit. I watched the baking time carefully and in my oven it took 10 minutes to get to the "top springs back when touched" doneness.
He's been in a garage (not always the same garage) for over 30 years, but before that he held pride (I don't know what the term is for a leopard*, I trust he'll forgive comparison with a lion) of place on the landing in my childhood home. I don't know if he'd picked up any creepy-crawlies, Al and I discussed the possibility of putting him in the freezer to kill anything unwanted, but leopard and case are jolly heavy - they'd fit in my freezer if I cleared it out first, but we'd never be able to lift it out again. And I wouldn't care to take him out of the case where he's resided for the past century. It would need specialist assistance.

This is especially important when the owner is not local.
For the uninitiated: Silman is a well-known chess author whose works on chess strategy (most notably How To Reassess Your Chess) have quite a following. Indeed, as I wrote earlier, this is one of two books that got me seriously interested in chess. Michael de la Maza is an amateur that dramatically increased his chess rating through an intense program of chess tactics. His method was first described in a series of articles and then in the book Rapid Chess Improvement. He also made Convekta a lot of money by touting its “CT-Art 3.0” program as being ideal for his system of tactics study. People that have put themselves through a rigorous de la Maza tactics regime refer to themselves as “Knights” or “Knights Errant”.

I was very glum yesterday: I had had such visions of productivity in the way of pages and exercise for my spring break, and in the event it is fully halfway over and I have essentially done no pages and no exercise! Debilitating insomnia on Saturday and Sunday nights, and then on Monday morning it came clear to me that really I wasn't just having the stomach-ache and slight queasiness of insufficient sleep, but really a minor stomach ailment that led to me spending the day in bed. Didn't even feel well enough to read a book, which is saying something. Stomach-ache has finally lifted this morning, fortunately, and I think I will run for an hour later on.

I have decided to follow the CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet because I've had huge success with it in the past. Apart from shedding cm's after the birth of Goosey (my first), what I loved about it was that I didn't have to think about what to cook for each meal or what to buy for the week. And that's why I'm choosing it again - for the convenience. Any health benefits will be a bonus.

Central to both the Matrix and to Dick is the creeping perception that things are not as they seem: our perception of reality, both individual and collective, is an artificial construct masking the unnerving truth. In ripping away the façade of normality, we come face to face with our true dilemma – we live in a maze of illusions and self-delusions from which we must extricate ourselves. This is, of course, a fundamentally Gnostic worldview.

So if I may, I'll clear a few things up here. Lets go back to a week ago from last Wednesday, when I had a bronchoscopy. That's where they go down your throat into your lungs with a little camera. While they were in there they took another biopsy of the tumor tissue in an effort to further narrow down the exact cancer we're fighting here. Bronchoscopies are not fun. You're not asleep when they do this. It really really sucks.

"Many parents would not want their young children exposed to the lifestyles portrayed in that episode," Spellings said in a nasty letter to PBS president Pat Mitchell. Her concern about young children not being exposed to lifestyles or ideas their parents disagree with seems reasonable enough. That's why I keep my little moppets safely padlocked away in the snowy ether of my fantasies, never to be exposed to any reality that might compromise my perfect vision of them. It's the only foolproof way of making sure my kids turn out okay, and it saves money on diapers, too.

The government – both at the Centre and the state (Odisha) – has reduced adivasis into mere exhibition items in attempts to lure domestic and foreign tourists. On one hand, the government while inviting multinational capitalists to plunder natural and mineral resources in the adivasi heartland is trying to repress voices of resistance by unleashing Operation Green Hunt on adivasis and the common mass at gun-point, and on the other, it is intensifying its efforts to turn innocent adivasis into exhibition items. Although the government claims to have amended the so-called laws in February 2012 to put certain checks on tourists visiting adivasi areas, it has turned out to be a blatant lie. In the same breath as the power centres in Delhi and Shahid Nagar are implementing the much-debated industrialization and displacement laws at gun-point, they are sending tourists to adivasi areas to click naked pictures of the adivasis, and turning these areas into tourism-friendly commodities. In Ganjam and Kandhamal, such inhuman activities are going on through unwritten permission by the district SPs in corrupt connivance with the said power centres. The same government that is sending police forces to these areas to ablaze forests, to burn down heaps of dry turmeric leaves, and to destroy people’s properties and lives is sending foreign tourists to click barren hills and bare bodies of adivasis: this is an insult to the people.

She was moving towards her first nap, was very irritable by now and it was time for a diaper change. These changes have become increasingly difficult. Not staying still for a second wasn't a problem for me, but when she started protesting and seemingly hating it, I couldn't understand and felt bad for her.

In medicine and body language alike, the area around the eye is referred to as the orbit, or, if you’re referring to both eyes, the orbits.

Second-quarter professional-level hiring is anticipated to be strongest in the transportation sector, where a net 9 percent of respondents said they expect to make staff additions. This was followed by a net 6 percent of executives in the manufacturing field who indicated they will hire during the upcoming quarter.

What we need to know is that every event we experience has within it both sides, negative and positive emotions. And it is your emotions and your emotions alone that determine your destiny. By evolving past your judgments and attachments, you honor what is, become present, and experience gratitude.

The final piece of this was the actual insertion of the micro-sphere beads. I ended up having to lay flat on a bed for 6 hours to seal off my artery in my right leg. I was told that the pain over the next 2 weeks go from very little to pretty bad to less than I had before the process started.

And third. When my brother David married to Barb in December 2000. They moved up the wedding because her Father was very ill. And as it turned out so was our Father. I will always remember the loving way Barb's Father looked at her when they had the Father daughter dance. Their wedding was very formal and so elegant. Still very fun but it shows how different and lovely my whole family is! We are a wonderful bunch of people! Sadly both our Fathers passed away shortly after but it is a wonderful memory because all my family was there and for Barb so was hers. :0)

I walked downstairs into the dungeon, to find 4 or 5 of my 7 players sitting around our table already, which was another awesome moment. In the next few minutes the rest of the players showed up and my table of 7 was full. We ended up pushing 3 cafeteria tables to fit all 8 of us. Jenna was eating a taco salad (ooh it looked good) and Dana brought out a bag of animal crackers. Almost all of them had their own mini’s, and I had a few for the others to choose from, which was this hilarious demon thing for the genasi swordmage, and a bag-carrying minion as the brutal rogue. Both minis were chosen by the players, I will post a picture of these soon, as they are hilarious. Roy and his wife had each painted their own minis, a priestess and a dragonborn, which looked very nice. We chatted a bit and I slowly started mentioning some game bits, pointing out the map, joking about last week (the breath weapon attack was a hoot) and soon the game began in earnest.
This may seem simple, but it is not. Generally speaking we are quick to criticize and complain. More often than not we are not willing to go the next step and think of practical, realistic solutions. So if you have an issue with how things are communicated between people, change how you personally communicate. Take the steps in your own personal life that you want others to be instituting. This is huge. Once you begin modeling it for people, then they expect that from you in the future. They may also begin reciprocating the changes back to you.
And I only write all this detail to show that there was absolutely no reason for me to be there at 6:00. At one point, the first technician came back out to tell me that my tech would be there around 7:15 and he'd then get Xander's room all ready. I began to wonder how necessary this all was.

The last few days I have been Spring cleaning! It’s been hard work and I did lots of steps without realising it. It was just as much as going for a 5 km walk. Today I guess I have been slacking a little or maybe it just depends on the kind of cleaning I was doing because I didn’t do so many steps. I have been putting cleaning, scrubbing and tiding up before myself

The way back is shut, and the way forward is fraught with uncertainty. And no amount of imaginative thinking, on the part of the West, will ever detract from the fact that the feel good animation of the ‘Other’ (Mickey Mouse and the Noble Savage) is but a pathetic attempt to find a worthy companion to accompany it on the ultimate quest, yet unfulfilled. There is no going back, something that even less zealous ecotopians are slowly but surely starting to realize. Chaining oneself to railroad tracks to prevent the passing of Atommuell trains in Germany, or the ramming of whaler ships in the Japanese Sea will not save the planet from dire environmental problems; something only the (rational) ‘re-focusing’ of existing technology can accomplish – and definitely not going back to the jungle to join the Noble Savage in his supposed environmentally friendly and morally ‘pure’ Utopia that has, in all its supposed a-historical and all-encompassing ‘truth-filled’ superiority, failed dismally to halt any of the woes besetting 21-century humanity. Why? Well, it has to do with the fact that naïve idealism, like relativism, is innately incapable of rationally tackling the existential problems we face head on.

Lord Carnarvon personally hired the expert archaeologist Howard Carter to team up with him in his pursuit of Egyptian antiquities. Their breakthrough work came in 1922, when they discovered the burial chamber of the young King Tutankhamun. Unlike rumors that had distressed the archaeological dual that they would ship the finds to England, the King Tut artifacts have been the possession of the Egyptian government since the discovery.

Victor escapes and his daughter is killed by Dimitri.
But there are still many unanswered questions about this strange planet. It is about three times the mass of Earth, slightly larger in width and much closer to its star — 14 million miles away versus 93 million. It's so close to its version of the sun that it orbits every 37 days. And it doesn't rotate much, so one side is almost always bright, the other dark.

There's an election campaign going on up here in Canada. Ours take a month while already down in the US, the campaigning is starting for 2012. I much prefer the Canadian election method. How many Americans, I wonder, are aware that we are going to the polls up here? I'd wager very few. It's not their fault though, I've seen zero mention of it in the US media. Canadian media closely follows the campaigning in the US. We are choosing between the current Prime Minister's conservative party, the Liberal party, the New Democrat Party which is very left, and the Bloc Quebecois whose mission is to make Quebec a sovereign country. I loathe Harper (the current PM) as much as I loathed Bush and I am really crossing my fingers that he doesn't win a majority government. Still, if Harper were a candidate in the US, he'd probably be more liberal than Obama. It's just how it is up here.

The show started in 1990, with three seasons that made up of 65 episodes. It has had some VHS releases and more recently, the full series had been stared to be released, with a Volume One and Volume Two in 2006 and 2007. Eleven episodes have been left unreleased, as well as the movie version of the pilot that included extra animation not made part of the 2006 release.

Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera L.) root extract (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg; orally) improved retention of a passive avoidance task in a step-down paradigm in mice. Ashwagandha (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg; orally) also reversed the scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg)-induced disruption of acquisition and retention and attenuated the amnesia produced by acute treatment with electroconvulsive shock (ECS), immediately after training. Chronic treatment with ECS, for 6 successive days at 24 h intervals, disrupted memory consolidation on day 7. Daily administration of ashwagandha for 6 days significantly improved memory consolidation in mice receiving chronic ECS treatment. Ashwagandha, administered on day 7, also attenuated the disruption of memory consolidation produced by chronic treatment with ECS. On the elevated plus-maze, ashwagandha reversed the scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg)-induced delay in transfer latency on day 1. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that ashwagandha exhibits a nootropic-like effect in naive and amnesic mice. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

For lunch we are going upstairs into Toni’s kitchen and are being served with some great pasta and real Italian tomato sauce. It is amazing how basic everything is. There is no electricity in the house at all. No computer, no TV, no telephone, no kitchen appliances. The pasta was cooked on a wood fired stove. Toni calls himself “lupus solitare”, the solitary wolf and Guido calls him “The mountain man”. I’m amazed about what a happy go lucky person he is. He keeps talking on in Italian and doesn’t care if we don’t understand.

Now, there are many things I could say about my experiences this year. And some of them are simply not for public airing. (Oh, and can I say first that the festival is fabulous and any negative experiences do not at all imply any lack of wondrousness of the whole thing?) But gosh, the egos that parade around that authors' Yurt (aka large and splendiferous tent) can make you dizzy. Some authors are painfully full of their own importance. Others, of course, are just delightful.

As for Hohn’s journey, the possibility that a yellow duck — or, to be fair, a red beaver, blue turtle, or green frog — could travel from the upper Pacific to the shores of Maine remains a concern until the end of his chase in 2008. In the end, though, the accumulation of facts and probabilities is only part of the story. Drawing on several years’ worth of travel, intensive study, and research, Hohn shares his insights on navigating the sometimes stormy waters of the adult world yet still seizing opportunities to let youthful exuberance set sail on occasion, or at least to splash around in the tub now and again.

For some reason, after experiencing something like cancer, “normal” becomes a highly coveted prize. For many years after my last round of inpatient chemotherapy, I tried my damnedest to get back to what I felt was my normal life. In college, I regressed and I tried to do things I thought I should have done in those 3 years lost to fighting for my life. However, it didn’t seem matter how hard I tried, things had changed and continued to do so. Life outside the hospital walls, had gone on more or less without me. And the fact remained; I had cancer. I fought it. I had war wounds and side effects to prove it…and they were not going away anytime soon.
That led me to The Burger Stand in Lawrence some time back. We were there for a concert last summer and based on its wildly favorable reputation from the few actual KU students I still knew, we gave it a try.

And so the story has to come up with a sufficiently compelling reason for why Melkur was able to break the rules. The answer, of course, is that he’s the Master. And the story plays perfectly fair with this, giving enough clues that anyone with a good enough memory of the show can figure out that he’s the Master before the big cliffhanger. But it’s still a great trick. And it does set up the season finale in Logopolis perfectly. The Master breaks this story and then escapes, setting up a finale in which he breaks the entire structure of the show.

This is the first time since I started to get really seriously about my weight loss at the beginning of the year that the scale as been up on weigh in day. A few times it was the same as the previous week but never has it been higher. I feel oddly calm about this. I am little bit annoyed, and slightly frustrated but over all, I don’t care. Ok, those are the wrong words…I do care. I’m just not upset about a little bit of weight gain this week.

The swing was phenomenal, from scraping by to having to turn down multiple projects each week because I was just too busy. They aren't all the same caliber I had before; whereas I had gotten very used to having editors and agents come to me with their best projects, now I'm taking on more private clients who don't yet have an agent or publisher. But I'm taking them on only if I believe they have what it takes to get commercially published, because I can't stand letting people down. And the advances are still down; an editor who might have offered me a $40,000 advance a few years ago now offers $20,000, and I'm supposed to split that with a ghostwriting client. But at least the assignments are there.

Mainly because it's very gentle but also has a nice cooling effect on the skin.

All of us live in this same world where we are constantly, day in and day out, surrounded with negativity. We learn to look for the bad, expect the worst and focus on what we don’t want to happen by worrying obsessively about it. I used to be the WORST at this! I would (and still do sometimes if I don’t catch myself) constantly worry about what could go wrong with whatever situation I was facing at the time. Do you ever worry? Worry is a product of fear and fear will incapacitate you from reaching your goals.

- the fallacy finds its origin in an extrapolation over national statistics; i.e. that everything is either uniformly distributed across individuals, or that there is a huge concentration around the average -thus rendering extreme ends of very poor or very rich individuals irrelevant.

In real-life however, especially in Moroccan real-life, these distribution types do not apply.

Never in my thirty four years have I seen a winter like this one in Michigan. Normally we would have been buried in snow since the first week in December but here it is the second week in January and we've only seen the white stuff ONCE. And as soon as it fell we bundled up and took to the back yard, though the kids stayed out less time than it took to bundle up which was irritating in itself.

Bolívar returned to Europe in 1804, and for a time was part of Napoleon’s retinue.
Now I've had many other funny vehicle moments - like the time I did a dashboard pedicure, or the time I got in the back seat, BUCKLED UP and was waiting for the driver to get in to take me home... but there was no driver, it was just me. Or the second time I did that - different vehicle, same result. Ghost drivers don't drive. And that my friends is a true story... just ask my Aunt Monica. I thought she was going to pee her pants laughing WITH me, because as I retold the story is sounded, well... rather stupid.
After the initial excitement wore off, Alli started getting a little antsy. But with an intermission to get her hopped up on cotton candy (thanks to Aunt Bacon) and a souvenir tiger, we were able to settle her back in for the remainder of the show. I have to say she was quite the trooper for sitting (for the most part) in my lap for 2.5 hours with all that was going on. I'm sure if she could have made her way to the arena floor to see everything up close, she would have. Just as she was getting really restless, the grand finale started and she was sucked back in again. I mean, who could look away when a guy gets lit on fire and shot from a giant crossbow across the length of the arena? There's nothing quite like seeing the reflection of the flames in your daughters eyes as she follows them across the sky.
I am so proud of her.

The Kajaki, it said, has been a 90-metre-high, rock-filled demonstration of foreign good intentions for decades but has never delivered the promised benefits to Afghanistan - a political showpiece and always has been since it was built (but not fully completed) in the 1950s by the US to compete with Soviet projects elsewhere in the country.

He was very friendly and easy to talk to. I know everyone has varied opinions on him but he really impressed me. I asked him about the Tour De Mount Blanc last weekend he ran in and he really went into a lot of detail about the race and how much different the European races are. I was really amazed by the way he looked. I knew he was cut, but seeing him in person was different. It really inspired me to get my diet back to the way it was when I started running, which I have started doing since that day.

That provides a reality check for Planetary Resources. OSIRIS-REx, planned for launch in 2016, is currently budgeted at a round billion dollars, and is to sample and return to Earth as much asteroid material as it can collect, up to a maximum of 2 kilos. Asteroid 1999 RQ36 is a soft, crumbly carbonaceous lump, about half a kilometre long, so collecting a sample of surface material ought to be feasible. Although the rendezvous is in 2019, the return capsule won’t arrive back on Earth until 2023.

I am 20 years old and there’s nothing I hate more than snotty girls my age, so I hang out with all boys. But every time I meet a cool guy, he wants to be more than just friends. This has happened numerous times and I don’t know how I could possibly be any clearer that I don’t want these boys like that. How can I get guys to back off and stay at that friendship level? I want a companion, not a boyfriend.
Today, this city officially called Godsend, this City of Bones, has become the most holy city in all the realms. It might not be the largest, but it is certainly one of the busiest. We get all sorts here: pilgrims and mercenaries; merchants, artisans; adventurers and tomb-robbers; historians, explorers, archaeologists; rich men and poor. Most end up in either the TEMPLE or MERCHANT QUARTERs; those that live and work here, and can afford it, call the RESIDENTS QUARTER home; we even have a quarter that has been claimed by those with the gold to spare and spend: the NOBLE QUARTER; although it's not just full of nobles– it's also home to the library, the museums and art galleries, and the most expensive restaurants and coffee-houses to be found in the city. Then there's the GREEN HILL– you can see it from here, peeking above the buildings to the West, that fortified, walled hill– that's where the rulers of our city run the place, some even making their homes there. It's also where the council chambers, courts, prison and barracks can be found. The last section of the city, enclosed and walled off from the rest, is where the WEEPING CHASM begins. We'll pay a visit there, when we take a stroll to see the DELVERS' GUILD.

Indeed time flies. I could hardly believe that so many things that happened are already a year old. The venture/social experiment with the three regular MDs was already a year ago. So much has happened since. But are we really all that smarter and better off than now than a year ago? I’d like to think so. Of course everything is a work in progress so naturally there would be times when things don’t seem to be going well. That’s just how life goes.

Well, I went to see the consultant... not exactly sure why I had to. It was one of those occasions where I was in the waiting room longer than in the actual appointment. Then, just to be told, we'll keep you under the midwife unless your back plays up... okaaaay. So, same as usual then. And am I sure I don't want a home birth? Um... that would be a big fat YES! Where are all the drugs and doctors and midwives and the delicious Heaven on Earth toast and tea after the birth? In H.O.S.P.I.T.A.L! I mean, I don't have all the drugs.

If there ever was a game that I could honestly say had an almost Salvador Dali feel to it then it would have to be Samorost, but it’s sequel brethren Samorost 2 is no different. Now in Samorost 2 you play as a little man who’s dog has been kidnapped by alien invaders. They’ve taken your dog and now you must fly off to go on a grand quest to save him and find a way to return home. This basic and charming premise leads to one of the most heartwarming and light-hearted stories I’ve seen in ages.

Most have been beyond encouraging and I thank every single one of you for that. For my people placing bets on how long I’ll last, thank you for pushing me to go further. There’s still that one particularly angry friend who I pray becomes OK with it considering he’s been in my life for well over a year now. He’s been short the past couple days, that is the one that hurts the most. I’m going to give him a couple months to accept the change it and hope that things get better.

During their recent Great Park Summit, the Miami-Dade County parks department announced continued plans to turn distressed commercial spaces into green space through a strategy known as “Red Fields to Green Fields”. These “Red Fields” represent a new type of post-recession neighborhood blight where failed commercial spaces and strip malls are scattered throughout re-bounding neighborhood. The Miami Herald reported that this strategy aims to remove blight while impacting the neighborhoods most affected by the recession. The hopes are that the new green spaces will encourage redevelopment and lead to increased overall property values and tax revenues for the municipalities. Proponents of the strategy look at new parks in Greenville, S.C., and Manhattan’s High Line as examples of how these green spaces can lead to economic recovery. A pilot program is supposed to launch sometime this year in one of the sites already identified in the city’s master plan.

In case you hadn’t gathered by now, behind the charm and talent Emilíana Torrini is simply a sweet and bloody lovely person. She’s got the best of both worlds when it comes to genetics too, bashfully owning a face that contains everything classically beautiful about Icelandic and Italian women. Strangely, her Italian roots have rarely been mentioned over the years. With her mother a native Icelander and her father an Italian city boy, there must be some tales to tell with two such opposing cultures coming together? “I found it difficult sometimes,” she admits. “I didn’t understand why I’d been raised very strictly in such a liberal environment.

In light of this how can Naik say he agrees with Jesus’ statements in John 14:6 when in that passage the Lord is claiming some of the very exclusive traits and titles of God Almighty?

Ward’s book is impressive, well researched, insightful, and compelling. It reflects a comprehensive study of Lewis’s life and work as it plays out in the Narnia books. This substructure that Ward has identified is undoubtedly there. Furthermore, I would venture to say that once you see it, you cannot un-see it. As a result, Planet Narnia is a worthwhile read for anyone who is passionate both about Narnia and Lewis. But here I offer a caution. If you are merely interested in Narnia, you may find Ward’s broader treatment of Lewis’s thought and life daunting. It is, after all, a rather exhaustive assessment. But if you are interested in Lewis’s work beyond the Narnia books, I think you will find in Ward’s volume a handy guide to the thinking behind the man who invented Narnia. The book isn’t perfect, of course. A few of Ward’s planetary discussions could have made clearer connections, and his theorizing about the occasion of the Narniad was unconvincing. But the overwhelming impression of the book is one of wonderful, ground-breaking scholarship into the thinking of C.S. Lewis.

Ask an NHL player about the spate of ill will and he’ll tell you some variant of ‘it’s the playoffs.’ As Crosby told reporters after a particularly malevolent day in Philly: ‘A lot of things happen out there from both sides.

For my 802 class, I dove into researching for my chosen topic: brain and cognition. I was met with difficulty right off the bat. This, I believe, partially because there was a plethora of studies done on the subject and other reasons being that my novice skills on the subject of research itself. Though, the project was challenging in multitude of ways, I surprised was the discovery of rigidness while working through this project. Which became more clear and palpable on the day to present our projects to our group members.

And as for the dream career…well, I have a good idea of the sort of path I’d like to follow…but I’ve got to work out a plan of action; discover what stepping stones I need to take….and then actually go for it.

While my husband was walking in and out of the room doing whatever he was doing, this guy, his friend, told me that he found me sexy. Then he appologized and asked me if he was out of line or making me feel uncomfortable in any way. I could have stopped it there but instead I showed him some pictures of myself, then he said he was getting excited thinking about me and I was turning him on, he asked if I was getting excited knowing that I told him I was. It just kept getting worse at one point he showed me a picture of his dick and asked if he could watch me masterbate or watch my husband and I have sex. That would never happen but I let him think it might. Now this guy is getting me a phone and wanting to buy me stuff which I am all for Lol. My husband on the other hand, wants to kill this guy. I know my behavior is wrong while its happening and it being wrong just fuels it and makes it that much more exciting for me. I am trying to talk my husband into letting me get whatever I can get out of this guy, hes not going to let it happen but I think it would be fun, Idk I know I have issues and I will be discussing this with my therapist on wednesday Lol.

Then, I moved to Kansas City, back to the American League, and fell in love with the DH all over again. The Royals' DH for most of those years was a wonderful guy named Mike Sweeney who kept his legs so far apart in the batters box you wondered if he was trying to do a split, and he would wave twirl his bat ever so slightly behind his head and -- I remember this detail so clearly -- he would blink like 5 or 6 times just before the pitcher threw, as if he was trying to get an eyelash out or something. Sweeney had once been a catcher, and he had tried valiantly to play first base and sometimes played the position to a draw -- one of my all-time favorite quotes was a coach saying, "Mike Sweeney would rather face Nolan Ryan on Christmas Day in a phone booth in the dark than field a ground ball" -- but he really WAS a designated hitter at heart, and for four or five years, from 1999 to 2002 or 2003, he was one of the best hitters in the world.

Thank you again to my friend who wants only to be known as the “Voice of the Trailer,” for inspiring me to write this story. As though Bill Frist wasn’t evidence enough of how misogyny and homophobia can preclude real medicine, now we have Dr. Lazar Greenfield. Greenfield quoted a study which found that women who had unprotected sex were less depressed than those whose partners wore condoms and made the claim that semen makes women happier. I would love to see the specifics of this “study” and who conducted the study and all of the other studies that contradict Greenfield’s favorite.
Occasionally, the transition is jarring. Nevertheless, ears are generally served well by Speed of Darkness, save for moments of occasional unnecessarily stretched-out sorrow. The first two-thirds of weepie-tastic The Cradle of Humankind are uncharacteristically sniffy and overly self-deprecating (“When a helping hand is needed / A slap in the face is what you get”), but launch into something that sounds resoundly more Molly-esque for the final minute of the song.

I'm SO excited to announce that I'm now the proud granny of 4 cute little kittens. My cat Mia delivered her babies yesterday during the morning. When I woke up, there was only one baby with her and I was worried because her belly was big enough for 2 or 3 kittens. It seems like the baby had just been born and she was still in labor. Of course she had to go to the most uncomfortable place of the house for me to keep an eye on her instead of using the basket I prepared for her weeks ago. When I realized what was going on, I brought the basket into the room in which she decided to deliver the babies and she jumped right in. I even had to grab the newborn kitten and put it close to her so she could start nursing it as soon as possible.

And while there was certainly not anything sleazy around the house, there was a lot of classical and renaissance art to be found in the big art books in our family library. These weren't hidden from me, and indeed we looked and and discussed a number of such paintings and sculptures when covering art history in homeschool. This also was different from many of the other strict families that we knew where anything from National Geographic to the Sistine Chapel which showed the unclothed human body was strictly censored.

WoW raiding in years past was far from perfect, but here we want to talk about what it did right. Even though the class balance, encounter design, and surrounding aspects of the game (e.g. consumables) were not up to today’s standards, the game allowed for deeply rewarding experiences because it remained true to the above ideal. Raiding in The Burning Crusade provided a perfectly good example. Freshly capped characters could run Karazhan, Gruul’s Lair, and Magtheridon’s Lair—easy, entry-level instances (putting aside the initial tuning difficulties those fights had, which are irrelevant here). Raiding the next tier, Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep, required completing some or all of the first tier (initially by attunements, and later simply due to gear requirements—again, details of the implementation are not critical). What matters is that SSC and TK were “open” long before the vast majority of players were done with the starting tier, and each each player (with her guild) was able to move into those zones at a time determined by one factor: when she was ready.

I would say that, for the most part, I had a pretty good adolescence and teenager-hood. I mean, sure, there were some severely shitty parts. I was goofy and awkward and was worried that my boobs would never grow and no boys would ever ever like me ever. I worried that, because I was utterly mystified by algebraic concepts, that I might actually be stupid and that once this fact about me was discovered, I would utterly fail at life. I fought with my parents and occasionally thought they were total idiots. I snuck around and did stuff I wasn't supposed to. I drank too many wine coolers and barfed everywhere...way more than once. I smoked pot when it was around and I took Ecstacy a handful of times. I had crushes on "good guys" who were often times just as bad or worse than the "bad guys" I also had crushes on. I was bored out of my mind in my small town, but I managed to make the best of it with hilarious friends and lots of school and parties and hairspray.

A lot of reviewers have commented on the "old-fashioned" nature of the story (in a good way!), which makes me happy, because that's exactly what I had intended: just a good, old-fashioned, somewhat outrageous, somewhat wacky comedy of errors -- but with contemporary characters and a more contemporary feel.

Though a “not-for-profit organization that brings these leaders together to work on projects that improve people’s lives,” one would ask if business leaders care about helping people or its profits. Also, what do they mean by “improve”? Its membership might give some idea. The WEF ‘s “members represent the 1,000 leading companies and 200 smaller businesses – many from the developing world.” According to their website, “a typical Member company is one of the world’s foremost 1,000 enterprises with a leading role in shaping the future of its industry or region, a solid projected growth potential and a turnover of a minimum of US$ 5 billion.” Though they claim they are “far from being a ‘rich man’s club,’” it is difficult to take that statement at face value (read here).

I read with interest your post of 10th January where you described how a queen behaves. Given your knowledge of these matters, I wonder if you could answer a question which has always intrigued me.
Let's say that each receptor is a different current (or 'topical') story, which is familiar to the editor or journalist on the staff of the metro newspaper. Topical meaning current, or relevant. The idea then is to make sure the spur on the dopamine unit can fit into the receptor representing that topical narrative. It must be a snug fit. What happens away from the spur, on the rest of the dopamine unit, is of secondary importance for the editor or journalist. Once that snug fit is made there is space to include other aspects of the story. The story you want to tell might constitute the bulk of your communication but it has to hang off the critical spur that will fit into the editor's receptor.

I readily admit I have no idea what these schools were like at this time, but this assembly and witchhunt over an article about admitting women seems melodramatic. Also, another scene that depends on a really long extension cord.
Anyway, it was definitely serendipity that reunited us three or four years ago when Honey and I were involved in a gentle head-on collision with each other.. There's more detail about that on the website too, but aside from the high improbability of the crash itself happening, the strangest thing was that we were both listening to Wire's 154 at the moment of impact. It would have been even spookier had we been listening to the same track, but I happened to be listening to 'A Mutual Friend' and Honey was listening to 'Two People In A Room', both songs somehow appropriate. Obviously it was a sign to reconnect, particularly as it happened on the A303 right by Stonehenge.
Rather than run right to Eastside I went Whitecloud- Wayout so I could relieve myself on the Yellow trail. That woman who skied up to ask directions sure seemed surprised!! Up on Zebra lift and little Amanda was working the top (what a friendly smile). Claire’s looked so good on the ride over that I had to do it. Taylors was the lead in. Kind of firm bumps underneath, but once to Claire’s proper it was smooth sailing and no one out in front. It was so nice that I decided to do it again.

Once cooled, place sweet potatoes, coarsely chopped poblanos and garlic in a food processor. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides when necessary. Add cilantro, green onion and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and process again. Finally add the cheese and process until smooth. (This can be done in advance and refrigerated for 24 hours).
I’m considering writing to him now saying “If you’re wondering why I haven’t responded, it is due to the fact that you seem to be unaware that your is used as a word to describe ownership, and you’re is a contraction for you are. Did you skip the third grade?” … I decided against that, as I figured it may be a little harsh. I think I’ll just leave him hanging and if he gets annoying then he will earn himself the title “DNA- Can’t spell.” Yes, it may have been a typo or a simple error. But the fact of the matter is that I wasn’t interested in him in the first place. Therefore this is a good excuse for me to ignore him and not feel as bad about it.

There was silence again. What did the truth even mean? Each woman held her version to be more sacred than the other: Hayley was the biological mother, but Laura was the maternal carer.

I went to work cleaning the spray foam poison off Thing One's window. When I was done, I picked up the paper on which the wasp had fallen. (Thank goodness for not cleaning under his bed often enough!) I started examining it when Thing One came in the room. We both looked at the wasp together, and then Thing One jumped and yelled "It's still alive" when the wasp's leg moved. I told him no, it was dead. It was moving only because I was messing it with (with the wipe). We went back to examining it, and it started moving MORE. I told Thing One to get out of his room.

I started eating whatever I wanted. And what I wanted wasn’t healthy. Things like ice cream and calorie rich Mexican dishes. And even in the 2nd trimester when my energy returned, I still didn’t work out. I didn’t work out my entire pregnancy. I was so miserable, even though I was relatively healthy, but putting so much weight on my small frame was hard on me. I’ll spare you the gory details.

Authenticity: Politicians are all too often over-positioned and under-authenticated. You can lose the authenticity in yourself and in the true purpose behind your party. Worse, you can start believing the spin around you and then people can see what you are saying is not their experience and then they are not listening anymore.
Thank you to my friend Fatimah for sharing this with me! Kudos to SUNY Buffalo and the BSU for holding a conference to openly address the discrimination against Muslims, Blacks, and Black Muslims. Here is just a bit of what was discussed: The question was asked whether or not there has been a shift or alleviation of discrimination and/or racism of African Americans to Muslims. Discrimination and racism of African American is deeply rooted in a capitalistic aspect–in that African Americans were a commodity to build the economy. Discrimination of Muslims is a little different in that 1. Muslims/Islam is not a race, it is a religion. So while they are discriminated against it is for different reason, and has increased as a result of the 9/11 attacks.

And I just have to mention that when her strong eye was patched in the doctor's office, Darcy's vision was tested at 20/60 in her 'helper eye.' Yeah, 20/60! I used the term 'helper eye' because that's what we thought her right eye would be. Kinda drastic improvement from the 'not as good as 20/400' diagnosis we were given at her first pre-op appointment with Dr. F back in March.

What the photo doesn’t really show is how deep it is. Frankly, I’m surprised that the doctor couldn’t see bone when he opened it up. Also, before they cleaned it the whole wound was full of metal dust and other assorted crap.
Ancient man acknowledged and accepted that energy, or spirit, exists in all aspects of the universe. As modern man is unable to exert his control over the natural universal world, he sought to ignore this interconnectivity. Modern man replaced the understanding of the natural order with man-made theological dogma. Jiriki Kata-Do reawakens our acknowledgement of the primordial phenomenon of universal energy accepted by our ancestors and abandoned and cast aside by our modern hubris.
Personally I would not ever want to know the future. I believe we create it every day by the actions we take so how could anyone know for certain. One small choice could change everything. And that is the beauty of the future and not knowing it. If we feel we are on the wrong path we can make changes, make different choices, even small ones to change the direction we are going in. Am I saying I don’t believe in fate? I don’t know, maybe those changes we make are part of our destiny as well… stepping stones to getting where we are supposed to be. I don’t know, its one of things I could ponder for hours and never really come up with a concrete answer for myself.

They did two blood draws again today. Like I said, they couldn’t get Mom’s meter to work on me for some reason. But on their own, my numbers were lower! Whereas last time I was in the mid-to-high 400′s (I think my highest was 469 or something last time), this time I was in the low-to-mid 300′s! Rock on! They did their first test on me about 20 minutes after Mom dropped me off, which was 45 minutes after my shot. My blood glucose registered 348. About 2 hours later, it was 327. I’m happy!

We generally avoid political type issues on My Florida Backyard, but a recent news story caught our eye because it involves the National Wildlife Federation (NWF). My Florida Backyard has always been proud of being an NWF Certified Wildlife Habitat; our whole gardening philosophy has always been based on it. So we were disappointed to learn that NWF has announced a partnership with Scott's MiracleGro, the mega-company that manufactures the most commonly used chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the country.

Little Feat’s debut album was released in 1971. The excellent Sailin’ Shoes and Dixie Chicken shortly followed. Critics loved the group, but their record sales never did match their acclaim. Estrada left early on, while the band continued to gain a reputation as top players who could handle anything Lowell threw at them, from rock and blues to country and New Orleans-style fatback funk.
The next night, Annie came to my house. We had fun, and for the first time in many months there were no tears shed. I bought her a subscription to an online dating club, which I figured would offer her a few laughs.
I wonder if the problem lies deeper than just students behaving badly, I wonder if the problem is within the society which these students are part of. Perhaps someone at some point has failed those students who act out and misbehave so causing them to seek other outlets for attention for belonging, which may not necessarily be positive and enriching. In an ideal world parents are helping teachers address behavioral issues and all parties are held accountable for student success, from students to parents to teachers and finally administration.

Laud we the gods;
This passage begins with “therefore” in the many translations, but it is translated as “wherefore” in the KJV. However this is not the same Greek word that Paul used in 5:1 that is translated as “therefore.” In fact, it is two words, Διὰ τοῦτο. The direct word for word translation into English of these two Greek words is, “because of this.” Because of what? Paul is referencing Romans 5:1-11. He is telling us that because of our justification by faith alone apart from works in which we received Christ’s atoning work on the cross, we must understand how the act of one man plunged all mankind into sin and how that validates the veracity of the atoning work of one man who is Christ, “the one who was to come.”

But the actual scale of it is minute in the greater scheme of things. I believe it exists, because I witnessed police surveillance, saw leaked documents, spoke to widows, and understand the bizarre cunning of the motivated serial paedophile mind. The problem is that every dysfunctional single mum believes she is the victim of a paedophile conspiracy to take their kids away – whereas the truth is, they are almost all gullible baby machines whom nobody in authority quite knows how to handle. I know, trust me: between 2006 and 2009 I spoke to most of them.

Ah yes. This one. I have just now, 2 years down the track, started to get some kind of grip on regular housework. Now there are a few reasons/excuses for this, but to be honest, many days it was just plain laziness/facebook addiction. There will always be days when it just isn't happening, and that's ok. Again, do what you realistically can, and provided your child is happy, fed and in a clean nappy, it's a successful day. My minimum I try and get done is dishes, washing, sweep the floor and pick up toys. Anything else is a bonus! Again, luckily I have an understanding and supportive husband who knows I try my best. (What he tells his friends and workmates though, I don't know)
Good Monday Morning to ya! So, are the days of going to the dealership to purchase a car starting to come to an end? Nah, that will never happen…but things are moving into the direction of using social networking for help on finding the best place to purchase a vehicle or have one fixed. It’s really not a bad idea if you think about it, because you’re really gonna be getting the skinny on which dealers to go to – all from referrals based on other peoples experience! So that brings me to the quick story behind this video. We again entered a crowdsourcing assignment and wrote and developed a commercial for a company “I shall not name”. After about 20 other submissions and waiting 1 month, we found out that it was down to us and 1 other person. So, of course we were ecstatic! To make matters even cooler, the president of the company e-mailed us and said we were the #1 commercial that are looking to purchase. So at this point, we’re thinking – we got this! I can literally say I walked around for about a week waiting to hear, thinking I already had it. Mistake #1! Also on our video, you could see that they had chosen it along with one more. Now we are two weeks later and they finally announce a winner. It wasn’t us, and it wasn’t the other production that was originally picked as the final two. It was a random one the company hired someone to do at the last minute who was never involved with the assignment. The video winners date didn’t even match the submission cut off time date, so I guess they weren’t worried about people finding out. But all in all, I guess they did what they did to get exactly what they needed. It was completely different from everything they had asked all of the production teams to do, but its all good. We still own the video, and decided to put it out as a message from MMG! We figured we’d use it for something:) If you also need more information on buying cars online, finding your local care dealerships, or getting a used car – e-mail us! We’d be glad to point you in the right directions on places to look. Lesson learned on this one, “Don’t count your chickens before they hatch”! Thanks guys, Hope you have an awesome Monday!

You see, death can be painful for those left behind, and sometimes a few of us deal with it, putting the pain neatly away and plastering a smile across our face while telling the world everything is fine… when deep down it’s not. But it could be, and it will be. And in the end, we will be stronger individuals – for ourselves and the people around us.
Time-Travellers Quiz
I came of age in the Left Behind era. Hungry for biblical knowledge and for special clues about the future, I tore through that fictional series, knowing that the stories themselves were fictional, but believing that the structure of the events were biblical. There is a group of theologians that do think this – called Dispensationalists – and this view is popular in the American South. What I didn’t know was there are several other end-times interpretations of the Bible that don’t include a secret coming of Jesus (“rapture”) or special timelines for a 7-year apocalypse. So if you study Revelation on a theological level, you’ll learn mostly about Amillenialists, Post-millenialists, Historic Pre-millenialists, and an assortment of many others.

But it is in the area of the environment where the government seems to have truly enforced the iron grip of their control. The Bill, by virtually tossing aside the Environmental Protection Act puts directly into the hands of cabinet the ultimate decisions regarding the approval of oil and gas pipelines. In other words, no matter what decision the Energy Board makes regarding these issues the Harperites can force reconsideration. It also grants the federal cabinet the authority to approve any new pipeline project as well as setting time limits for any regulatory review. This change alone makes every major energy project a potential threat to the environment. No longer will prudent decisions be made taking into consideration the public good, but the basis for any final decision regarding the environment will rest on the ignorance of the politicians in cabinet and the debt they owe to any particular lobby for helping them to be elected.
There’s this band called Frou Frou that has a song called Let Go that is featured in a really sad scene in the movie Garden State, which Zach Braff stars in (and I totally have a flashbulb memory of the moment I saw that scene but I will spare you all). In the song, there’s one lyric that has always moved me more than the rest, “there’s beauty in the breakdown.” I really believe that’s true on so many levels. Breakdowns are so necessary. They keep us sane, they keep us balanced, they let us be totally and completely honest. They aren’t a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength.

As detailed in the letter from the USPTO, the two slogans were compared on the basis of “appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.” Because the two “highly similar marks” are both used on clothing, “consumers are likely to reach the mistaken conclusion that the goods and services are related and originate from a common source.”

Everything is weak and absolutely incredulous in BLOOD MONEY. Firstly, the term BLOOD MONEY refers in normal parlance to the amount to be paid to a victim’s family in return of immunity to the perpetrator of the crime involving the victim. This movie’s story has nothing to do with this. It is supposed to be a theme related to fraudulent deals in diamond trade: because there was a movie called BLOOD DIAMOND which dealt with murky happenings in the diamond business, this movie has been named BLOOD MONEY.

What I would do next time: take the advice of all the recipes out there saying to prep and freeze. These fruits need much more time than bananas and strawberries to get ready for the blender. It would be wise to prepare the night before for a quicker breakfast. All the counter time and handling warms them up, too, so freezing would’ve been a great way to make this an ice cold smoothie. I’d also be sure to remove thick skin and stringy things from all of the orange pieces. It was a little too chunks for my taste.

Wall Hangings:2
And I remind everyone again that this was not my choice. No. But I will not go gently. Rage on.
My sister and I watched the 2 littlest boys playing in the sand while the other kids were off playing somewhere nearby. We chatted at the picnic table enjoying the relative peace and quiet when all of the sudden we were hit with a wall of sand traveling up to 100 mph! We watched in horror as our 2 little boys were swallowed up by the sand. I ran to my 4 year old and did the only thing I could, I wrapped him up in a human cocoon to keep him safe while my bare arms and legs were pelted mercilessly by the flying sand. My mind was in a panic wondering where my other kids were but it was impossible for me to move the wind was so strong. As soon as it let up the littlest bit I picked up my son and ran for the tent thinking I would put him in it and search for my other kids. However I saw that the poles had come loose and were flying dangerously in the wind, it was about to collapse. I had to instead put him under the semi covered "porch" of tent number 2 and tell him to stay there with his eyes closed. I had no choice but to leave him to find my other 2 kids. I struggled against the sand and wind screaming their names but the storm was so loud no one could hear me. I started to panic. I had no idea where they were and no way to find them. I bumped into one of my nieces who yelled over the storm that she thought they made it to one of the RVs. I ran over there and opened the door. There was my 6 year old, on the floor of the RV curled up in the fetal position crying. My 8 year old daughter had found him tumbling down the road like a tumbleweed and rescued him. She sobbed to me, "I was with cousin Jacob too mom but I couldn't save them both. I had to save my brother. I don't know what happened to Jacob."

Why not cut from Tim Ross saying ‘you should wait three days to call’ to Judith Lucy calling bullshit on that idea.

You’re right, quick cutting between people repeating the same information over and over for half an hour is better.

Brothers and sisters do not test God, but take him at his word: How is it that we are saved? Is it by our brains being convinced beyond all reasonable doubt? Is it by digging our thumbs into Christ’s wounds to check if they are real? Is it by gold-dust? No, we are saved by faith; by taking God at his word. His word is Jesus and there are no two ways about it. This is the truth and we are blessed because of it. Remember the echo of what Jesus said to Thomas, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” (John 20)

As aspiring author Julie Cantrell found, there are accomplished writers out there who are happy to give you advice on marketing your work. Email them, Facebook them, or add them on LinkedIn, just don't be too pushy or stalker-ish.
Love is love, says my wise sister. When you see love, why would you try and tell it it comes in the wrong variety? We need more love, not less. If people are so devoted that they wish to promise love in sickness and health, for richer for poorer, we should put up bunting. The human heart beats and yearns and lifts and falls just the same in the chests of all sexualities; it knows no difference.
OK, spill the beans....what's with the pyjamas? I know its hot and you are nothing if not practical. But why do you persist on wearing them all day, every day? I did at first wonder if I'd misinterpreted a fashion trend, but I have taken a closer look and I really don't think I'm mistaken. Call me a stick-in-the-mud, but seeing adult women wearing pjyamas covered in little teddy bears or Winnie-the-Pooh whilst squatting in the gutter selling partially dead eels is a strange phenomenon.
I got back to Heather and Julia's at 8:30 pm, and then got up really early this morning to (now, don't faint) attend CHURCH where we had the baptism of Griffin. Which is a whole 'nother story in itself. Which I will tell tomorrow. I can say that there was no lightning shooting at my head, no fire and brimstone raining down and identifying me as the heathen I am, and I did not say "fuck" once. So, woo to me and my manners. Mamma done taught me right.
In other site news…WE GOT A GOLD STAR! If you happen to notice this giant gold star on our site, The Fangreaders gave it to us, in honor of the fact we help promote their Fanfic Events on our site! Isn’t it lovely with the Sheriff of Area 5 on it? And they personalized it too! We feel very honored by this, as you can imagine! For those of you who love Eric and Sookie fanfics…don’t worry, you’ve come to the right place to keep up on all the latest fanfic news!
Today we disagree over age of baptism, age of communion, frequency of communion. We disagree about what the Bible says about alot of topics. Some we stick hard to what the Bible says while some we let slide what the Bible says. For instance according to the Hebrew scriptures we are not to eat shrimp or bacon, but I love bacon and shrimp and especially bacon wrapped shrimp. So we are not that keen on keeping these things not allowed by the Bible, but homosexuality is right out because the Bible says it is wrong….
"Demented Aggression" roars out of the gate with blast beats (and shows other, newer, bands that having been around for decades doesn't mean you have to mellow-- this could've been recorded by 18-year-olds); "Scourge of Iron" and its initial open-chord chug stand out, as does the blistering "Encased in Concrete"....

Good luck getting that one returned. Yet again, replicas are easily replaced. Your master store-bought game is not. You could ask for another original game for Christmas. But then I suppose you are probably not going to get the other new game disk that you wanted.
Coming straight out of taking Digital Writing during the 2012 Fall Semester, I was both hesitate to take Writing in Digital Spaces and excited at the same time. Familiar with the concepts principles of Henry Jenkins’ new media literacies, completing Writing in Digital Spaces has helped me to build and further expand my knowledge on new competencies. The new media literacies that I am able to easily associate with what I have learned in this class are those adopted by the National Council of Teachers of English in 2008:

“The inmates gripe about it,” says Susan Fenner, who runs the Texas Inmate Families Association, though she noted that prison administrators are responsive to families' concerns. “They feel that the prices are too high.”Thirty percent is a sizable markup - a grocery store markup, by comparison, might be in the low single-digit range. On the other hand, TDCJ commissaries literally have a captive clientele.

Speaking of the word “off” I need to rant a bit. Back in the olden days when I was teaching in Jud, ND, I had this great grammar book that put two little incidental rules at the end of one chapter concerning off and at. I had never thought of those two rules prior to using that book, and actually have not seen them since, but I wish more of us adhered to them.

Semen is a more delicate question. One might argue that a man who allows a woman to get hold of his ejaculate should take it on the chin if she later displays pictures of it in Facebook. There’s no point crying over spilled milk. But what if she doctors the semen by adding pepper or cumin, to make it look nasty and unpalatable? It could ruin a man’s sex life.

According to the EIA, petroleum accounts for less than one percent of electricity production. So wind and solar, which do not produce transportation fuel even if Obama’s $40,000 Chevy Volt quadruples production, can only replace coal and natural gas, of which America has an abundant supply. As for biomass, over 40 percent of domestic corn consumption goes to ethanol, which provides less than 10 percent of our transportation fuel and causes food prices to increase. Three large production platforms in the Gulf could provide an amount equivalent to all of the biofuels produced in the U.S.

On the other hand, the first dessert of clementine confit, poached Chinese mushroom and chantilly cream looked on paper to fit my expectations of inventiveness, a twist on French styles, but unfortunately the tastes just don’t quite combine and it’s just shy of a success.

Yes, there are days when I feel so overwhelmingly alone, that I don’t know how I could possibly live a “full life.” What if I spend my life by myself? If that is the case, what a miserable experience that would be; I can’t live with my parents forever, and I can’t hide in a foreign country for the rest of my life.
Viognier is supposed to be all about the fragrance, the exotic perfume of peach and apricot and their blossoms. It is often described as haunting and seductive, whereas I just usually find it alcoholic, clumsy and bitter.

Which will pocket the cash? These answers and more…in this week’s post. Sounds like the opening to a reality show doesn’t it? I suppose it could be if you had agencies competing, but this is my post and we’re here to talk real life examples and their positives and negatives.

I invited my neighbor,Margaret for tea in my parlor. As we sat down for tea, a lovely surprise, my lovely 90 year old friend, Hazel came for a visit with a turkey, squash dressing, cinnamon almond bread, and the recipe of cinnamon bread, I have been dreaming of having this cinnamon bread recipe, and with a starter to make the cinnamon bread too! I shall frame this recipe! Oh , sorry, back to my tea sampling. I added another cup and desert plate. Today we sampled Vintage Tea's Earl Grey Creme Tea. Yes, it was wonderful, for this was my first Earl Grey Creme Tea. I tried it with just sugar, and liked it, Hazel took her tea with honey and milk. Oh, I had to add the milk, loved it even more. Margaret took her tea with just a wee bit of sugar. The tea pot was empty in no time, as we sat and talked, while eating the homemade persimmon cake, Victorian House of Scones cinnamon blueberry scones, and chocolate puffs. These scones are a mix and have been voted the best scones in USA. I make them and Hazel takes a frozen batch home, she loves the scones so much. Now Margaret she loves my persimmon cake, when she comes to tea, she takes home a few of the persimmon cakes.

So, yesterday I had to attend Horizontal Violence (incivility) training, it’s mandatory for the place I work. Basically, there’s about a 10% turnover in new staff each year, and one of the main reasons was something like a hostile work environment. The people either didn’t fit in, or felt they were bullied.
The Internet makes interaction with readers in some ways much easier. In the peace of your own home, you can answer fans' emails (I try to do it once a week). Though one sometimes gets unanswerable questions: "what phase of fantasy would you say Stravaganza is?" (say what?)for the most part this is a rewarding way of having fan contact.
Ben Lawson or Chief Lawson is the local lawman of the town and knows everyone. He is surprised to see Molly but not his reaction to her. Since that night when he was twenty two Molly looked different. Now was his chance to be with Molly even though he knew he shouldn’t with all that he doesn’t know about her. But sparks will fly and Ben will be there for her even when trouble starts out her window.

I really should pack my hospital bag just in case anything happens soon. I've had a couple mild contractions while typing up this blog post actually. Usually I just get the tightness in my belly from the Braxton Hicks but these were a little painful. It's kind of scary knowing I'll be going into labor within the next month. I know this is what my body was made to do, but it's still intimidating and nerve-racking. I just have to think of the positive and that is that we will all have a beautiful blessing added to our lives at the end of it all. I can't express enough how lucky Jake, Jaxon and I are that we have such supportive family and friends. We love you all so much and wish we lived closer so we could physically be there with you guys.
Strangely though there have been rumours that Paolo Di Canio wants to leave at the end of the season however this doesn’t seem very likely and I would be very shocked if he did go unless he got offered a Championship job. Di Canio has won 35 of his 56 games and also guided his team to the final of the JP Trophy which they unfortunately lost. Some fans may have thought that this was a terrible decision at the start of the year especially as the team did not start of fantastically but the gamble has paid off. But the big question is will he and his players be able to perform at a higher level? Personally, yes I think Di Canio will be able to cope with the promotion simply because he is a big personality and he may even be able to attract even better players to the club which will only be a good thing.

For example is it appropriate for me (trying to write seriously) to comment on the likeness James and Rupert share with Pinky and the Brain? No? Shame. You see in terms of business and “taking over the world” Murdoch has proved himself beyond the cage of Pinky and Brain, not only fit but exceptionally successful – despite any efforts at playing the senile old sod.
In the beginning of my unschooling journey, I had many questions (what, where, how) and no tools to find the answers. I also had very little support or understanding from the people I needed it most from. Being shut down after trying to bring up the idea really makes one feel hopeless, especially when I was doing it mostly alone.

If there is a restaurant in NYC that I have been dying to get back to, yup, it's Momofuku Ssäm. From the casual ambiance to the incredible pork belly, I have been craving this place again for well over a year. So with a gorgeous January day on the East Coast, I hopped the train out of Princeton, for a quick jaunt up to Penn. From Penn Station, I hopped on the A/C line down to 14th Street, and then switched trains and grabbed the L train over to 3rd. From there, it was an easy 2 blocks over to Ssäm Bar. Such an easy trip really.

The combination of both the exfoliation and a lightening product seem worth a try. I've only been using these for two days so I will report back in three weeks and at the eight week mark.

But where Anarchist practice really triumphs is in the course of everyday life among common people who would not be able to endure their dreadful struggle for existence if they did not engage in spontaneous mutual aid, putting aside differences and conflicts of interest. When one of them falls ill, other poor people take in his children, feeding them, sharing the meagre sustenance of the week, seeking to make ends meet by doubling their hours of work. A sort of communism is instituted among neighbors through lending, in which there is a constant coming and going of household implements and provisions. Poverty unites the unfortunate in a fraternal league. Together they are hungry; together they are satisfied …

You need to do a couple of things first: ASK YOURSELF WHY and DO YOUR RESEARCH. Having done this, TWICE, I will say no combination of colors or letters or dances done on the campus square is worth the trouble. You join for that reason and you’ll be a dead-beat frater or soror in two years. On top of that, a fool for all the money you spent. If you’re doing it for acceptance, tread carefully. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be accepted, humans are not that different from the rest of the animals, we recognize the value of being in a group and we are all looking acceptance. But how far are you willing to go get it? While I am shocked at how some organizations would treat someone they want to be their sister or brother, I am more surprised at the number of people that will tolerate debasing behavior to be called someone’s brother or sister. I have 5 BLOOD REAL sisters, and while they have dosed their measure of tough love to prepare their baby sister for the real world, it has never involved hitting me or humiliating me. They would only kick my ass if I ALLOWED someone else to kick my ass (LOL) because we have more pride than that. I suggest interests get some too before they even consider this. Next, do your research. And in case you didn’t know that means: visit the website to get acquainted with the values and history, get to know the local chapter (outside of the parties, market days, etc), get to know the alumni and most importantly SHOP AROUND.

For instance, why was it necessary to murder the unarmed mother of two little children, Mrs Venessa Stafleu, 34. Simply shot dead in front of her children on April 30 on her Randfontein dairy farm. And why the gruesome injuries in a hatchet attack against the dairy farmers Pieter en Brenda Loubser on their farm in Malmesbury; the gruesome double-murder of Dutch dairy farmers Johannes en Jacobi van den Bosch near Pretoria.

So first, the headline. In the last two years, the total fertility rate for Australia (which represents the average number of babies that a woman could expect to bear during her reproductive lifetime, assuming current age-specific fertility rates apply) has dropped from 1.97 in 2008 to 1.89 in 2010. That is a reasonably significant drop (nearly 0.1 of a child!).
“By doing what you did, you created a danger not only to the integrity of the process but also to public confidence in it.

Learning to recognize when we are arguing with, or struggling against, reality may be one of the smallest shifts you can make in your attitude. But it may also yield one of the most significant insights. Very simply, recognizing when you are fighting reality spells the difference between guaranteed misery and a life filled with peace and contentment.
