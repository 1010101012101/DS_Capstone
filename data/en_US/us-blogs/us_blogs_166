During my recent sojourn in Brisbane to bestow upon baby GOG some of the grandfatherly bonhomie and beaming conviviality for which I have become renowned, the only conveniently located take-away food establishment open for breakfast before the 7 am hospital appointment time was the House of McYuk.
Back again today to discuss another anime, this time it is a full series of 24 episodes running at around 20 minutes each, and takes an unusual writing and story style to place the audience in a situation where they delve into deep psychological and emotional problems within the lives of the 12 or so children involved.

One year as a child seems like forever. One year as an adult flies by. It has been one year today since I lost my sweet Grandmother. This day one year ago rocked my world. This day one year ago saddened my heart more than I realized was possible. This day changed my life.
My personal hope is that those who write, or who may be considering writing the next generation of GUI configuration programs for FreeSWITCH will get this book. It basically shows you how to do everything you need to do to create a working PBX, and for those that are programmers, Chapter 4 is where the real magic is revealed. That said, I would highly recommend this book for anyone attempting to develop a project using FreeSWITCH!

I am so excited to wear my new faux fur vest. I've been eyeing many different styles and finally decided on this one at Nordstrom. I've been thinking about the many ways that I can style it, of course, and didn't realize how versatile it is proving to be!
In Paul’s language, “each is given the manifestation for the common good” and “Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many”, you sense the language Rome used to keep people in their place and thus, maintain power.

I loved V’s post on vintage recipes. I knew MawMaw—knew V’s other grandmother, too. Elsie, I must say, was a character—a Wonder Woman. She was a kind, intelligent woman who could have been really something in today’s world of more opportunity for women—she raised a wonderful son mostly on her own. Now that I am “of an age” to appreciate what her life was, my hat is off to her. V has written about her before and must again.
I wish I had known about menstrual cups years ago. I think of all the money I spent on disposable products that still didn't work that well anyway. I don't have to spend another penny for at least 10 years. I never have to worry about leaks again, and best of all, I only have to change it once in the morning and once at night.
These are ways people can verify what I’m saying with public-record information.
You may have noticed if you've been reading this blog for a while now that our family likes to pick our own fruit beginning with strawberries in the spring, followed by blueberries beginning of summer, blackberries mid-summer and apples in the fall. Oh, can't forget the pumpkins and if I could find a pick-your-own raspberry farm we'd be there in a heartbeat.
In that school I was teased for my Italian last name: Nardelli which in french is very close to Marde au lit (shit in bed).
Just as I thought I would pass away with boredom, my sister arrived to save the day. I picked her up from the airport on Thursday evening, the weather was a warm and breezy welcome for her, as she came from the chilly northwest. She was just here with me in May whilst I was going through chemo and radiation, and now she is here to get me out and about and comfortable with my appliances in public. I've had one incident, while I was driving, and had to pull over and change an entire appliance. This was good for figuring out exactly what I need to carry in the car with me.
I wonder what the people who dismiss the Dale Farm residents as "just pikies" think has happened to the "real old Gypsies". For it is the granddaughters and grandsons of the folk in these wonderful old photographs who are the residents of the Traveller sites of today. Many people use the argument that Irish Travellers "don't count" somehow, and apparently possess great inside knowledge when they state authoritatively that the "genuine Gypsies" can't stand the Irish Travellers either. All of this is nonsensical, divisive fear-mongering. I think there's a part of these Traveller-haters which deep down is perhaps angry at their own life choices and the comparative freedom of Travelling people who seemingly don't suffer under the same rules and restrictions placed upon "law abiding house-dwellers". They are unable to accept that different people choose to live in different ways, and that those ways might be deeply intrinsic to their culture and way of experiencing the world. I've observed a simultaneous slight envy of the free roaming life coupled with extreme anger at the fact that they can live this life.
Another aspect of Ferguson’s midfield selection was the use of Giggs in a narrow position on the left. This was designed to help pack the central zones and pitch in against City’s creative forwards but Giggs was unable to effectively cover out wide. His lack of mobility meant that Zabaleta has space to run into and often give City a spare man over on their right when going forward. It was from a Zabaleta-Nasri worked move that City won the match winning corner.

The Manhattan of today is still haunted by the ghost of New Amsterdam . New York ’s commercial imperative and devotion to progress have buried the past in cement, but the streets of the past exist largely as they did.

British Steel is not an album requiring much introduction, since it's one of the most popular of Judas Priest's outings and one of the better known in all of the heavy metal spectrum. The English legends had already built up a staggering momentum by the time 1980 struck, and this put them well over the top into the living rooms and tape decks of enthusiasts the world, and many galaxies over. I've met extra-terrestrials from far down the nearest Spiral Arm who have this on their .mp3 player. Seriously, if you've not heard "Breaking the Law" by now then you're either three years old and under (in which case you've probably STILL been exposed to it, just not retained the chorus), or you're from some undiscovered tribe of aboriginals on some uncharted island who worship overhead air traffic as deities; in which case I should not be addressing 'you' in the second-person since it's unlikely you have the Intertrons.

It's a good story, but it appears in no other accounts of Washington's life and was never mentioned by Washington himself. Even Weems was evasive about his sources: "I had it related to me twenty years ago by an aged lady, who was a distant relative," was as far as he was prepared to go.
That’s illustrated in the lives of Adam and Eve’s first sons: Cain and Abel. Cain was an unrighteous man who sought to please God by his own efforts. God rejected him (Gen. 4:5). Abel was a righteous man who worshiped God in true faith. God accepted Him (v. 4).

The reason I am sharing that little story is this: It made me realize that what was blocking me from my goal was not a insurmountable physical impediment, but a simple mental shift. I am bringing the high box jump into my art and my life. Some of us never realize that we have a second wind (myself included). I am forcing myself to mentally push past some of the limits that I have reasoned out so carefully, and I hope that you will too.

These toys don’t require anything more than the simplest motor skills (ie. pressing a button), yet the age groups they’re assigned to range from 3-10.

All right, that's my soapbox speech for today. In other news, I'm getting married in ten days. I'm staying with my future in-laws and just as busy as I can be. Between Wii Golf, gardening (and getting burned), and watching the cows, the days are just packed. The hard part is to carve out time on the computer. There are a lot of Connollys.

Chef Paul Joseph always enjoyed cooking food, so it was no surprised that he left his accounting job to go to school to receive a degree in culinary arts. After finishing school he began working at various restaurants in New York City. While working in New York City and New Jersey, Chef Paul cooked for many diplomats and entertainers such as, BB King, Roseanne Barr, former Prime Minster of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, and Rwanda’s President Paul Kagamé. He received two stars from the New York Times, three stars from The Bergen Record (New Jersey), and was feature on Good Day New York (fox news). Chef Paul had worked at many fine dining restaurants and 4 stars hotels like the Hyatt Regency, Bobby Van Steakhouse, Bambou Restaurant. Chef Paul had trained under some notable chefs such as, Sam Hazan at Tavern on the Green and Scott Cutaneo of the Le Petit Chateau.

However stinky and esoteric, there’s nothing nefarious about smudging a new home. Sure, it’s not for everyone — I am NOT in the habit of giving smudge sticks along with enchanted crystals as housewarming gifts — but for many, and not just hippies, neo-pagans and those of Native American extraction, it offers a sense of healing and the chance to participate in a potent and sacred ritual.
Now some might object that if a boss is paying you and you don’t like how you’re being treated, then you should just move on to another job. Well, that’s okay in theory. But low-wage, dead-end jobs are a trap. They don’t teach you the sort of career skills that allow you to lift yourself up out of that rut. And they don’t pay you enough to where you could afford to take classes to learn the skills you need to escape. And finally, they destroy your soul to such a degree that they kill all hope, self-worth, and self-esteem. You stop believing that anything good can happen to you, that life could ever possibly get better, that there will ever be an end to this pain and humiliation and misery.

I made a very bad decision for her 0 month pictures on the location for her monthly pictures and chose a place that gets absolutely no natural light-thus making it very difficult to get a good picture.

That was a tricky bet for Apple. The lessons of the past were learned, and it may be the mistake Amazon are making with the dedicated Kindle - just as publishers once believed the print book was sacred – Amazon may learn the Kindle does not equal the ebook alone. There are no mugs in Amazon and the launch of Amazon Publishing may be about to change a lot of things in the publishing industry. But I don’t expect them to petition the Oxford English Dictionary to have ‘Kindle’ replace ebook, just as it was commonplace for ‘Hoover’ to replace vacuum cleaner.

MOSCOW – Engineers and scientists at the Russian Space Federation cheered wildly on Sunday when their $127 spacecraft, Czar Trek II, successfully smashed to pieces upon crashing into the Pacific Ocean. The impact was the culmination of years of planning, followed by a week of scrambling after the vehicle was unable to escape Earth’s orbit and head to its original destination, Mars.
Also, to further expand upon my embarrassingly low maintenance (read: cheap) habits, I had only ever had a manicure once prior to getting one on Saturday so I really wasn't expecting much. I don't like manicures because I generally don't like people prodding at my cuticles and other sensitive bits but what's more, I don't see the point in them. They usually only last a few days at most without chipping so why not just do your own nails? Well, I'm happy to say that the manicure I got on Saturday was pretty awesome. They were by Orly and I think they're called gel fx manicures but anyway, the end result is literally chip proof. It feels like I have a super shiny protective gel shell over my nails and the results are supposed to last like 2 weeks. Whhhattt!

Parting the Waters speaks of the difference between preachers and prophets, how Martin Luther King Jr. wanted to be a preacher and became a prophet, how he choose a small congregation in the beginning and just rose and rose to become a symbol. Newkirk’s piece seems to accommodate preachers but yearns for a prophet, and in a gallery, where neither preachers nor prophets ever seem to lurk anymore, Newkirk offers a resonate, fascinating dilemma and drama. It could turn you shy.
Travelling aside (for this weekend at least) I have finally been able to settle into my life here in Krakow. I managed to find yoga classes that help to bring balance to my life.

I think this is something really inspiring to think about & it really hit home with me. You never know how much of an influence you could have on someone else's life just by a simple gesture. Stop and think about someone else for a change or treat someone how you would want to be treated if you were in their situation. You never know what has happened or the story of that person that could have put them where they are today. I know it is easy to get carried away with everything that goes on in our lives but take a minute to be grateful for what you do have & the people you have been blessed with in your life. You never know how bad some people have it without even having the choice. I know I would not be where I am or WHO I am today if it weren't for a lot of people and the many things that have been done for me. I am very appreciative & love everyone that is a part of my life. I really can't imagine my life any differently. Thank you for listening :) Now go read this book!

"Jeff, I'm a talent agent," she said. "My job is, essentially, to sell talent. And Katie's talent pretty much sells itself, you and I both know that, which makes my job really easy. But it wasn't just her talent that got her this job, it was her personality. They said when they interviewed her they were captivated by her disarming smile, and the way she expressed herself with such confidence and grace. When she talked about her own experience with loss, her voice, eyes, body language, facial expression, everything about her exuded an overwhelming sense of...of hope. A kind of confidence in her own ability to endure, and a hope that other children going through the same kind of thing can and will endure too. This is a difficult subject to approach with children, and they wanted someone in this role who has that kind of confidence. They said Katie's ability to empathize, and her simple way of expressing herself, especially to the younger audience this project is aimed at, is exactly what they were looking for. In short, they don't want an actress to play this part, they want Katie. As herself."

I don’t know how it is in the rest of the world but in Sweden we don’t like to be loud where people can hear us say “stupid” things. So if a teacher would say “Say: Mama give me money” very few would say it out load and you really se how everybody gets embarressed. So then many teachers skip it.
"Reluctantly leaving this beautiful prospect, we resumed our studies, and passed across a foot bridge to take a look at the grist hopper then being filled from the elevator. It is a large square iron receiver, tapering towards the bottom, capable of holding eighty quarters of malt, and is placed over the tuns below. To view these vessels we had to descend to a lower stage or gallery On our way we came to two hot-water tanks, each holding 120 barrels, protruding a few feet from the wall, the larger and hidden portion being carried over the roof of the next house, while another boiling tank is situated in the opposite corner of the building. They are both heated by steam coils from the exhaust pipe of the engine, and in front of them are two steam automatic traps for cutting off the condensed water."

I got over the fear of short hair when my friend, Trina, cut her hair short, but it wasn’t a boy cut. I liked her hair, so I cut my hair the same way.

Religion, in its essence, is simply the institution that has been established by human beings to collect spiritual teachings and practices in order to strengthen our connection to Spirit. Spirituality is the basis of, and reason for, all religions. In order to codify spiritual practices religions rely on two components: 1) Ritual, which is the exterior form of an activity, and 2) Intention, which is one’s interior attitude while performing the ritual. Of course there are too many “religious” people who ferociously follow the first while completely ignoring the second, just as there are “spiritual” people who simply want to experience an interior feeling while refusing to surrender their egos to the rigor of routine practice and the commitment to act for the benefit of others. While a “religious” person may declare “My religion is the only, one, true way!” a “spiritual” person may proclaim, “I am more highly evolved than you!” These are both ego strategies.

The misses, on the other hand, have been huge. Kei Igawa (not shown) is the absolute king of them. As of last year, Igawa was still pitching in the minor leagues, playing out the ill-advised gigantic contract the Yankees gave him with Michael Scott in Scranton-Wilkes Barre. I saw him pitch a couple years ago at a Durham Bulls game in North Carolina. He got lit up for like 6 runs in 2 innings. I have never seen a player look more defeated when, after about the fourth double in a row, Igawa looked into the dugout practically begging to be pulled out of the game and no one came. I actually felt sorry for him. Of course, I also heckled him like a New Yorker would and got a lot of gasps from the more congenial southern crowd.

It seems that whenever a new conversation about race in America is started, no matter the good intentions, the starting point is always the same. The American historical experience and conception of race is grounded in the opposition of blackness and whiteness, two categories socially constructed over time in ways that have served to define “the other” as “not us” and “us” as “not them” at the same time as preserving power and privilege for one “us” over the “not us.” Thus, it’s no surprise that The Good Men Project’s call for a new conversation about race, and its intersection with what it means to be “good men,” begins with four personal, deeply felt, and honest essays that nevertheless fail to acknowledge that when we talk about race in 2011, it’s no longer enough, if it ever was, to color the dialogue in only black and white.

So how can you do it? Unfortunately, this type of love doesn’t have something you can do. It’s something only God can do. But because of His great love for you, and His love for your spouse, He chooses to express His love through you.

“The diligent efforts of our police department and the innovative use of the county’s CodeRED state-of-the-art system reunited two parents with their missing child in a matter of hours,” said Levy, noting that the youngster had apparently made his own way out of the family’s front door in the early-morning hours. “While this story had a happy ending for all involved, let it serve as a cautionary tale for all parents with infants or toddlers to child proof doors and windows, as well as hazards that are within reach.”
Finally, I discovered during the course of my research that Annie's father Henry Orchard (1826-1866) was second cousin to Jacob Botham Smith (1840-1925), who featured in a series of articles on Photo-Sleuth two years ago, entitled "A mystery marriage in Barton-under-Needwood."
While the cake was baking, I made the toffee sauce. Jim watched me mix the butter and brown sugar, and said, "That looks awfully rich." He sounded as doubtful as I felt. I said, "Wait until I add the cream." But I also added two tablespoons of lemon juice. The lemon juice was an addition of pure genius; its tartness cut the sugary sweetness of the sauce into something quite palatable. Downright delicious, in fact.

Magdala’s most famous personage is Mary Magdalene, a faithful follower of Jesus throughout His earthly ministry. Early in His ministry, He cast seven demons out of her (Luke 8:1-3). She was at the foot of the cross, witnessed His burial, and was the first to see Jesus after His Resurrection. The next post in the Hike the Bible series will be on Mary Magdalene.

Bullying is generally defined as an intentional act that causes harm to others, and may involve verbal harassment, verbal or non-verbal threats, physical assault, stalking, or other methods of coercion such as manipulation, blackmail, or extortion. It is aggressive behavior that intends to hurt, threaten or frighten another person. An imbalance of power between the aggressor and the victim is often involved. Bullying occurs in a variety of contexts, such as schools, workplaces, political or military settings, and others.

In the meantime, we ended one grading period and began the fourth quarter of the school year. To simplify my job, I keep Casia's school year more or less on the public school calendar because I already have Garrett in the system. Casia's year starts with Garrett's and she gets off days that he gets off. When his grading period ends, he is issued a report card. It's at this time that I take a look at what Casia's been doing the last 10 weeks or so and evaluate whether I think she's making good progress and what still needs to be accomplished.
Body Mass Index (BMI) – most people have heard about it, but very few people know what it really means. BMI is a number calculated from a person’s weight and height. It is considered by many health care professionals to be a reliable indicator of body fat for people. And, it’s also an inexpensive and easy-to-perform screening tool that may help indicate possible weight-related health problems.

Readers of this blog will have to become accustomed to photographs of patches of grass where pubs once stood, but the fact is that once demolished the sites of many pubs remain empty for years, sometimes permanently. The site in this photograph is one such example. It’s a pleasant patch of grass lined by trees at the junction of Lark Street (known as Lever Street on the 1849 map of Bolton) and what was once Hulme Street but which is now a continuation of Charles Street, but this patch of land is the site of the Spread Eagle Hotel.

Bad enough to have printing costs taken out. But what writers who aren't familiar with dodgy publisher-speak may not realize is that "sale price" doesn't mean list price, but the publisher's net income--the money it actually receives from retailers and distributors, which, because of discounting, may be as little as 40% of list. (This is what's known as a net profit royalty--and it's not a good thing.) So instead of getting $7.50 on the sale of each of your $15 books, you might actually receive as little as $1 ($15 x 40% = $6, less $4 for printing = $2 x 50%).

There is good reason why the wisdom at the heart of the traditional indigenous worldview strikes a deep and appealing chord in the human psyche. Modern science is now telling us what indigenous wisdom keepers have known and taught across countless generations. We humans evolved over millions of years to live and prosper in community with one another and nature. Our happiness and sense of well-being depend in substantial measure on our connection to nature and a caring community. Science now acknowledges that the Original Instructions are, in effect, genetically encoded into the more highly evolved mammalian and human centers of our brain.
So that's basically what's lined up for me in the new year - immersion in the novel and not much else whatsoever! There will be one other event I'm really looking forward to, however: starting on 6th Jan, over on my other blog Fictionbitch I'll be working with the Faber Academy to host a discussion on the crucial subject, Why Creative Writing? Writers Sue Gee and Marcel Theroux, directors of an upcoming Faber Academy course for beginners, will contribute their views and answer any questions. It should be a must for anyone involved with Creative Writing!
Anyway onto a card that I whipped up this morning. I am a bit low on male boy cards in my stock so thought I ought to remedy that.
Last year if I would of gotten on a scale it would of screamed at me to get the heck off. You think I’m kidding, but I was close to weighing 270. -shivers- That is a big gulp to say. The funny thing is, I thought I was just fine and beautiful. I didn’t care what anybody thought. All I did was sit in my recliner and play a stupid online virtual reality game. I was gorgeous on there. Ha! My RL (real life) self was lazy, fat, obese, and just plain out mean. Anyway, that is for another post.
I can't speak for all games (and I'm not talking about guys who are spending money they and their families can't afford to lose), but I think if more wives understood what most poker nights often actually consist of, they wouldn't begrudge their men the opportunity to live out their dreams for a few hours each week.

Hip hop and I were born around the same time. We grew up together. We once trawled disco beats before discovering life was hard and listening to new music that felt as alienated and angry as we were. There were moments of sweetness, moments of pain, and a lot of fantastic music. But it wasn’t until much, much later, as we both approached our early twenties, where we found our true soulful voices.
Madeleine's trace was lost on May 3, 2007 in a hotel complex in Praia da Luz where she was staying with her parents, Kate and Gerry and her twin siblings. The British family was spending a holiday in the Algarve along with three couples, five children and the mother of a friend.

I have this book entitled “Good Morning… GOD” by Pamela Steinke, and it is really one of the best books I’ve ever bought. It contains passages that are meant to inspire and to awaken the hearts of those who read it, at a daily basis. The passages are written so that they really feel like God is talking to me, delivered personally. This is the perfect time for me to start reading it again, to start the year right.
I'll probably lose some readers for saying this, but I'm not always the biggest fan of the Target collaborations. I feel like they typically just water down a great brand instead of selecting a few piece to offer at a price most of us can afford.

This time around it doesn’t appear to be the case. Today, I heard about a school where, to cut costs, people in the same department I work in were let go. Based on a lot of what I’ve read in the past couple of years about college education, I should have seen this coming. Just take a look at the news today. Student loans and interest rates are the big thing Congress is squabbling over. For a while now, people have been questioning the value of a liberal arts education, especially when young adults are graduating with thousands owed in loans and no job prospects whatsoever. This is the new reality…a college education is not the ideal it once was. And who can blame people for thinking this way when things are the way they are?
I'm also very excited that I have 37 lovely followers (as of 7:37pm EST on 10/30/11)...my goal is to keep things entertaining and unique enough that at least 100 of you amazingly wonderful ladies (I haven't met any men-home-decor/crafty bloggers yet...sorry to leave you out if you are a guy) choose to follow me by 1/1/12.

After six years in Paris, Kelly returned to New York in 1954 where a friend gave him a hardcover publisher's dummy of an old Sigfried Giedion Bauhaus book from the 20s thinking the blank pages would be perfect for sketching.
English can create a bond between people, but it can also bring about class division and social hierarchy. English is perceived to be the language of intellectuals. One doesn’t become smart if one speaks English, but somehow Filipinos associate English speakers with intelligence. Maybe it’s because scientists, politicians, economists, and the like speak in English. Or maybe it’s because of the telanovellas. The actors on tv speak Filipino, but they burst into English when they need to say something “profound.” Jericho Rosales would be like Mahal na mahal kita, di mo ba yon naiintindihan? Tson’t you know tsat lab is[2] (insert profound English sentences here).
Having been at the receiving end of comments such as, ‘seriously, you are a Muslim?? But you don’t look like one’, I find such comments extremely offensive…I asked how Muslims look and the douche couldn’t reply. You don’t just look at someone you don’t exactly know and assume that person is this or that? It’s totally wrong and I find it unacceptable. Once, I went to fix my phone at a repair centre and while waiting to pick up my phone, I started up a conversation with this other dude and as I was leaving he stood up with me and said ‘Lets Pray’. I asked him if I told him I was a Christian and he answered in the negative. I asked him the reason for his assumption and he said I simply didn’t look like a Muslim. I poked him further by asking him how a ‘Muslim’ looked and he couldn’t answer. I shook my head and walked away as it was really pointless arguing with an illiterate.
Finally, I hopped once again into my silver Mercedes, dozing off on my personal backseat checkered blanket as we drove to Belgium for dear Celinoo's wedding; during the cocktail, many prominent, international guests came by the Mercedes to curtsy or bow before me, and during the ceremony, as Mary-Laure walked up to the mike to read her limerick, a song composed and performed by the bride in my honor played in the background ("Benjy Pipi", hopefully soon available on iTunes).

The deal is that they won’t swear and neither will I. I mostly do OK at this, although “shit” tends to be used from time to time. I’ve tried to substitute “shoot” instead but it doesn’t really fool them! I do use Spy Kids’ “shitake mushrooms” occasionally! I’ve been doing this since my then 4-year old stepson came into the room with a truck and very casually announced “the f***ing thing is broken”. A very good call for me to clean up my potty mouth!

How I welcome this week. There was romance, the usual angst and so much forward movement. So now we know Tae Yong is not dead, the J.Crew should be returning soon (I think), Yi Gak knows Se Na is Park Ha’s evil sister and that their doppelgangers have the same relationship back home. Rich Mom knows her daughter is a witch and I hope she ends up losing something she was going to get before. I hope Tae Yong wakes up and tells the world what Tae Mu did. I now wonder how many more tickets to New York Park Ha will get by series end.
In modern democracies, soldiers remain citizens when they enlist. As such, they retain the rights to vote and express their political views. However, they are also expected (and legally bound) to act in accord with the rules governing expressing their opinions as members of the military. Of course, this is also true of almost all jobs. To use an example, while I surrendered no rights when I became a professor, I am obligated to regulate what I say in my official capacity. I cannot, for example, spend class time campaigning for Obama or support political candidates by saying that they have been endorsed by Florida A&M University because I endorse them.

It only adds to my curiosity – why would a star who should be able to rest comfortably on her laurels still sign up for relentless touring? This time, she’ll do something like 19 shows on her Asia 2012 tour, hopping between Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Hong Kong and Indonesia with only a day off in the whole time. It’s clear she’s finding it tiring: “It’s been a lot of the travel. Two or three times it felt like we were going to Australia every day from LA.” A scheduled press conference was cancelled and in person, she does seem weary. It shows in the cast of her face and the way she responds to some questions with almost uncharacteristic brevity – sometimes her answers are shorter than the questions themselves.

Joan McAlpine’s views fit the regular SNP bill of policies, but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The SNP have often been seen as a strong party for the youth of Scotland as they have many policies to support young people currently in effect. The SNP chose to keep the Education Maintenance Allowance in Scotland despite their friends down in Westminster cutting it, showing they still believe it to be a lifeline for many young people across Scotland.

The BBC have finally been forced to admit that the clenched fist salute, which Norwegian mass murdered Anders Behring Breivik has been making at the beginning of each day of his trial, is not “a far right salute” as the media have so far been insisting, but is in fact one which is more usually favoured by left wing extremists. A gesture, at its most iconic when made by Nelson and Winnie Mandela in front of the world media on the day Nelson was released from prison in 1990, or by black athletes as a sign of “black power” at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.

After last week, when it snowed, we hit a heat wave with temperatures in the 20s. I fell about laughing as Dave tried to light the fire in the evening as it was warmer outside than in, he wouldnt listen to me, and so all the smoke came pouring though the wood burner and fell to the ground like special effect ghostly smoke! Opening all the doors shifted it and once the sun was behind the hill the temperature dropped and it lit. Our flat has walls of about two foot thick, excellent insulation, but often in the summer we have to open all the windows to let the warm in!

They were a nap, people. A 45 minute nap in my unmade bed in the middle of the afternoon. It was cool enough that I needed the sheet and warm enough that I didn't need more. A blissful, decadent, uncharacteristic, just-because-I-could-and-the-two-littles-followed-suit nap.
My desk has been a constant source of embarrassment.

Funny as I was researching this great drink, the origins are pretty hard to come by. But I found that this cocktail was invented in Florence, Italy allll the way back in 1919. Supposedly the Count at the time, Camillo Negroni, invented it by asking the Bartender to spice up his drink, the Americano, by adding Gin instead of Soda water. Then the bartender went into his creative juices and added a orange slice instead of the normal Lemon to show that its a different cocktail.

The pink was considerably brighter than I had anticipated from the website photo. I was expecting it to be sort of a pastel pink on white background, it’s actually almost hot pink on very pale pink background. It was very vivid and cheery looking. The decoration was mainly printed on, in shades of white, grey, and black, with a little embroidery by the neckline. Also, this garment had some decorative silver sequins, pink rhinestones, and a large round metal ornament.

To the Methodists, I was a curiosity. To the Jews, I was a problem. The Methodists saw me as the result of a flawed marriage. The Jews saw me as something that didn't count once took sides with my father over my mother in the divorce. That made me really, very angry. And it made me hate Judaism, even though my beef was with the congregation, not the faith.
The campaign, some argue, did more to hurt the music industry than to help it. The RIAA claims that 35% of people knew that downloading music for free was illegal prior to their campaign. They also claim that since then the number has risen to 70%. Knowing that free music downloading is illegal does not deter the majority from doing so. And the rising popularity of BitTorrent clients and programs like Retroshare increased illegal downloads exponentially, making not only entire albums available to download with one click, but an artist’s entire discography! There is some debate about whether or not illegal downloading hurts an artist nearly as much as it hurts their label. Artists make the majority of their money through concerts and merchandise. And anyway–how many of the artists you listen to now, whose concerts you have attended and t-shirts you’ve purchased–would you perhaps never even bothered with had their music not been available for free online?

The Cardinals should be in a good position to win this series. The Pirates have been an up and down team all year, and might start to heat up since Pedro Alvarez is swinging the bat better. The Cardinals have been pitching phenomenal all year, and even Jaime Garcia pitched well in their loss to the Brewers. The Pirates are still a year or 2 away from contending, and their postseasonless, or even winning yearless streak probably will extend this year. They have some talented young players, though, and could get hot when the weather heats up. A.J. Burnett stifled the Cardinals in his last appearance in a Pirate uniform. Their pitching has been stellar this year, an Gerrit Cole, the Pirates number one overall pick of last year, should be coming up pretty soon.

Unfortunately after this point everything went to complete shit. I forgot to boil the sugar and honey to pasteurise them and I just dumped the two of them in on top of the juice like an animal! This didn't seem to matter in the long term as no noticeable infection occurred as a result. I gave everything a big shake, checked the temperature, took the gravity reading and then WTF 1081 !!!!! All my gravity readings up until this point had been in the 1040 - 1050 region and this one completely blew it out of the water. I had been expecting it to be on the high side but not that high, I read around on the internet and deluded myself into thinking it would be fine and the yeast would simply die in the high alcohol content.

It is clear to me that the London environment of the 1950s was the trigger of my subsequent lung problems. That a simple lung infection one winter should have such long-term consequences brings to the fore the question of the medical treatment I received at the time. The answer, in terms of the conventional medical practices of the 1950s, was none and the reason for that rests with my parents' beliefs. My parents loved and cared for me and were concerned for my health and development, but neither of them believed that conventional medicine had the answer to my lung infection and its subsequent chest problems. I was never, either at home or at school, given the obvious remedy of a course of antibiotics.

He told me he imagined the men were controlling. Arrogant. That they must be full of themselves and angry. He told me he feels as if I'm asking him to be someone he is not. To change who he is and it is pulling him in a direction he isn't willing to go.

From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than truth—her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty.[18]
The problem I have with the Cranberry and Blueberry beers is that it tastes a lot like carbonated and flavored water (Clearly Canadian anyone?). Don't get me wrong, I love cranberries and blueberries, just not in beer. These are the types of beers that you can have about 6-ozs. of and then are completely tired of it.

It is only a matter of time before this type of crime escalates off the coasts of West and Central Africa and yields like-wise valuable pickings to this scum of the sea.
"I read that some of the first groups that were persecuted by the Nazis were unions and liberals," Mr. Smith reportedly told Janet L. Conley of the Fulton County Daily Report. "I thought, 'Wow. Taking over the world, persecuting unions and liberals. Sounds like Wal-Mart.'" Wal-Mart spokesman John Simley reportedly would not discuss the case except to say that the company was still studying the ruling and that Smith's attempt to "commercialize the holocaust" was "unprecedented."

Whether he should have been so blatant is moot. Maybe he should have moved with more political cunning and skill, but to be honest politically he's a lightweight and happen as not he was probably outmanoeuvred by the more savvy political players in Europe.

All of these arguments can be pretty convincing. Especially if your outlook is completely me-centered. But, as Christians were are commanded to treat others the way we wish to be treated. (Leviticus 19:18) Would any of us say that we can’t be bothered with ourselves? Of course not! In fact, it is in our nature to act as if the entire world revolves around us. If you don’t believe me, just baby-sit a toddler for a couple of hours. This is the sinful nature of man. We are taught by the world to “look out for number one” and that it’s “every man for himself” and the life is really just the “survival of the fittest”. Do you hear how selfish and unloving this is?
Have a great day~
That said, the five of us met over beer and brownies at Opal Divine’s prior to last night’s thunderstorms and reaffirmed our intentions to return to the stage. In the meantime, we’ll be getting together in splinters to write songs and goof around.

President Obama’s first daughter, born July 4, 1998, is named Malia. Coincidence? I don’t believe it is. Obama’s second daughter born, June 10, 2001, also has special pagan significance. This name is especially common in Europe where it is used primarily by males as a diminutive of Alexander, although females may also use it as a diminutive of Alexandra.[15]

Governor’s School recently lost all of its state funding, because North Carolina doesn’t think that it’s worth the money.
It was probably my subconscious protecting me from embarrassment.
But their progress down that path was slower. They had less of the relevant genetic variability for natural selection to act on. Meanwhile, another path opened up. This was the one leading to the formation of more complex societies, such as the Mayans, the Toltecs, and the Aztecs in Mesoamerica, and the Incas in South America. They were able to take that path because of their relatively low level of male-male rivalry. There was consequently less need for pacification—a key precondition for development of complex social relations (i.e., State formation, specialization of labor, creation of roads and other public infrastructures, etc.).

One would think the stock market, for instance, runs on money. Or, perhaps, greed. Both play their roles, but neither could keep the process going without faith, faith locked in by random positive reinforcement. Keep the rats in mind while we move on to bears: According to Standard and Poor data, there have been no fewer than ten bear markets – a drop of 20% or more — in the United States since the 1930s. They’ve bottomed out for an average of sixteen months before edging upward again, with stocks on average losing 31% of their value at their lowest point. The worst collapse remains the 1929–1932 decline of 83%; the next highest were 49% in 2000–2002 and 48% in 1973.
Poor service has earned Detroit public transportation a deserving poor reputation and because of this poor reputation, ridership has remained lower than many other major cities and metropolitan areas. Low ridership rates mean less revenue and that makes it more difficult to improve the areas necessary to better Detroit’s public transportation reputation. It is a vicious circle that much be broken if long-term growth is to occur regarding transit and Detroit in general.

Once per game or session each player or party may choose to either a) exclude at first appearance the use of any one character, unit, vehicle or other protagonist or group of protagonists, b) skip any one encounter, c) resolve any one combat as if the player or party rolled the best possible result on each die or d) remove a number of turns equal to no more than one quarter of the standard or average game or session length.
And today browns remain important as authentic reproductions. Without browns, reproduction quilters would be at a loss. Plus those toned down colors are a great decorating palette. Brown is a classic neutral that goes well with wood.

The judging takes place on just a small part of the circuit, a few linking corners that provide good viewing, and opportunities for drifting. The rest of the circuit is irrelevant, except as it pertains to controlling the temperature of the tires and setting the car up for the first judged corner. In the tandem passes, the lead driver often feints his or her entry to the first corner to upset the chase driver, however in some European series, this practice is frowned upon by judges and considered foul play, resulting in deduction of points.
2. The ESDC's claim that city streets should not be valued because they don't have development rights is odd. First, the $3.7 million is minor component of the calculations. Moreover, the streets are crucial to the construction of open space, which is a project requisite. The land would have to come from somewhere. Forest City didn't pay less for other land because it would go only to open space.
So where the fack am I going with all this? Who knows.
NOT A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS – YET
One of the series features a historical serial killer who mutilates prostitutes. The gatekeepers don't like the prostitutes. This is where I do have problems. Er, actually, the killing is more offensive! This is not just an issue about books, is it? It gets right to the heart of attitudes towards what is and is not acceptable, not just in fiction but in life. We object more to prostitutes than to serial killers. Do we really?

This book is dystopian, a genre I've never been all that interested in until The Hunger Games. Since then I've read and enjoyed several books categorized as dystopian. Rhine's existence is one of difficulty. I can't imagine being put in a situation like hers. The whole sister wife, polygamous lifestyle is... disturbing. And the antagonist is thoroughly villan worthy. I'm looking forward to thesequel because there were a lot of unanswered questions.
Yet the lessons learned from the dying have illustrated that all of life should be lived as if it could end at any moment. The true value and meaning of life are found when it is viewed from the perspective of its final days. So this precarious moment in time, when destruction hovers nearby, is a true gift. It is an opportunity to find our way back to what is most essential, to rediscover joy, and to rise to our highest potential. Because the dying have already navigated their difficult last days and found abundant life in the midst of decline, they are perfect teachers for us now as we face our uncertain future.
We don't have tracks in our town that I know of, so I thought of a lovely location about a block away, and when the lighting was just right, John and our family, on the missionaries' preparation day, drove them there on our way to take them home.

I had another post planned for today, but then I got word (via Twitter) of some really sad news. One of my fellow design bloggers passed away suddenly over the weekend. Marija Stephens, of the wonderful blog Holding Court, was such an encouragement to me via comments and email since I started my blog last fall. She was a wonderful designer (and blogger) with a beautiful family.

She's still pretty little, although she's definitely got some chub on her arms and legs! She's getting ready to go on her first plane ride! We're going to North Carolina to visit friends who just had a baby boy. I'm sure Madilyn will love Nolan! That will probably be the topic of my next post. For now, here are some pics of my sweet little girl. You'll see that she is quite the character!

Jacob still needs to be rocked to sleep at night. We then place him in his crib where he usually stays for a couple of hours. He generally wakes up to pee! And, if we're awake enough to lull him back to sleep enough so that we can get him back into his crib, we do. If not, or later on in the wee hours of morning, he comes and snuggles with us. His sleeping has gotten MUCH better. He only wakes up once, maybe twice now. And, once in a blue moon, just to spoil us, he sleeps through the night! It's coming, folks... sleeping through the night!
I hope you have a great week-end and Happy Crafting to you all.

I really thought my hair would react differently than it did. I would definitely try Original Moxie again(maybe on longer hair).
The second book was OK but kind of a disappointment to me as it had recipes, and for me, any pages with recipes are just wasted space. The EGE gives me a continuing subscription to O Magazine, and I love it (fabulous writers!), but I always skip over the pages about food and recipes (and also the ones about hair and make-up. Geez, come to think of it, I skip over a *bunch* of pages. I'm probably missing a huge whack of stuff, but I care nothing about those things, and life is too short to spend time reading about stuff that doesn't interest me. Especially when it's geared to getting me to--duh--buy stuff).

It was of course wonderful to win – and nerve racking. I had a feeling I would win but of course you want to prepare yourself for not winning – so by the time Joan Lingaard announced the winner I was ready to fall on the floor. I had recently come second in a short story competition, and was a runner up in the Mslexia poetry competition – so thought I’d be second again.
Other than that, here is also a cake I made for little girl's birthday cake, Olivia. I feel privileged to be able to bake her birthday cakes for the three years of her life so far, even though I have never met her. The theme for the cake is "Olivia" the pig, first time I've heard the character that I had to google it to know what it is :).
But this was one side of the coin where we can see what we want and live it through visualization and feelings. In this physical dimension where we live it’s utterly important to ground the energies that we want to experience. How do we ground them?

In the end I think I got my decision pretty much spot on: A long sleeve compression top with t-shirt on top, with shorts covering my legs. It was cold as we waited though, the traditional garb of the runner (trusty binbag) keeping me as warm as possible before the start.

Writing for Liberal Democrat Voice, Mark Pack looks at the party's influence on today's Budget: "George Osborne’s previous strange absence from the debate was put to rest when he announced a series of pieces of good news on the Green Investment Bank: starting a year earlier, £2 billion more in funds and, crucially, it can borrow."

One thing about the book that was very different from the other books was the time traveling. It was something I did not think of that Hermione was getting into but it was an interesting side factor which later on of course came into play with the plot.

My husband struggled to get the bike down, but he did, and in one piece. I took it for a spin and it felt way more comfortable than the other one. The seat even had springs to cushion my bouncing butt and I was happy to discover that now you don't even need a wrench to adjust the height! I liked the colors and even the faux wood trim. It reminded me of Pee Wee Herman's bike. Sold! Here she is -- she's a beauty, isn't she?

I think Italy can be easily considered one of the countries with the worse tv channels, which all seem to treat women like passive objects of sexual desire.
The positives: Spam is meat in a can, and they’re seeking to inspire people to spice up meals by adding spam. What kind of character typically saves the day? A knight, which is exactly the character chosen. It makes sense, and so spam wins some points there. Will it attract attention? Possibly, if anything because it’s new and different.

To be honest, I've never felt entirely comfortable when giving out advice, largely because I still feel like I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. (It took me eleven tries before I even figured out how to open this guest post.) But even though I'm still learning every day how to grow as a writer, I've at least learned a few lessons along the way that my younger self could've benefited from knowing.
So in the middle of the night I will have a fever and the pain will reach a point where I know something is quite bad, while this is going on I can not walk, sit, stand or lay down and I want to go to the ER. But the pain subsides and I no longer need the ER.

I just got the Jenni Bowlin Jester Border punch from Fiskars & the My Mind's Eye Dilly Dally Paper pad from the Miss Carolina collection. This paper pad reminds me of the Fair so I dug out an older stamp set that I haven't really used and created this fun card. For the ribbon, I clear embossed the striped ribbon tails on yellow pattern paper, then went over it with distress ink to bring out the image more and give a subtle tone on tone look. The circular part of the ribbon is embossed in opaque aqua zing embossing powder on the red paper then carefully cut out. I cut the center out of a coordinating pattern and turned it so the plaid pattern was at an angle. The edge is inked with pumice stone distress ink to give some definition then popped it up with foam. I typically don't use brads in my projects but for this card I created my own coordinating embellishments by punching out some small circles from the paper and layering them behind the brads.
So I guess the reason I want to write is because I have creative urges that I want to put into something, and ideally something which is greater than the sum of it’s parts. I’ve been lacking in confidence, in my ability to do that, in devoting time to doing that, and therefore just a general drive to start and finish that. I write the blog for practice, to up the quality stakes a tiny bit, for commitment, to test myself in different aspects, and now for the fun. I’ve a rough idea where the blog is going, but excited to see what destinations it arrives at, and what stops on the way. But I don’t see this as my only output, my contribution to the writing world, just the gateway to find another. So what reasons do you write for? If you run a blog, why do you write it? I seem to have worked out why I do mine.

My family has recently taken an important step regarding the education of our children: our third-grader will not be participating in the New York State Assessments in ELA or math this spring. This decision was reached with much thought and research, along with our own experience as educators playing a major role.
That Bill Shute did send me a good selection of Sorrows material for me to sift through, and from what I could tell these guys were a rather capable if not quite hard-as-nails tough beat band. Of course they could've/should've been a whole lot gnarlier with the proper feedback drone applications of the day, but like a good portion of the European rock groups on the cusp they sure knew how to mix their beat and their psych to palatable effect.
Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, fired back a letter hours later telling Jablonski he was free to abandon the case and not participate but that he would do so at his and his clients peril.
As a reward for following the rules, we are granted freedoms, maybe even pocket money, and certain "rights". Our rights do not inherently exist because of our own existence but because of the existence of the government that grants them.

The Global Emerging Middle is a class of citizens and consumers defining a critical growth horizon for companies over the coming decade. They are found largely in markets we define as the ‘Next 4 Billion’: countries like India, China, Indonesia, parts of Africa and Latin America where over 4 billion of the 7 billion people on our planet reside. Not only will this horizon define how businesses grow over the coming years, but strategies to foster profitable growth in this segment will determine whether companies can achieve sustained success.

Plus, the draenei seemed to enjoy riding in silence. She kept looking around at all the boring trees and grass and whatever else all the nature around them contained. Flowers, no doubt. There were always flowers. And bugs. Creme knew there were bugs; they kept biting her. Her hands kept moving to swat them away. Apparently the bugs didn’t bother Brulee though, ’cause her hands were steady on the reins the whole time.

Iron Man is a great movie character, with Robert Downey Jr. making the most of a fantastic part. He's smarmy and charming all at once, the perfect expression of the "billionaire playboy". I like how Stark's intellect is his real superpower.
“Touch DNA is just one of many exciting new techniques now used to help solve crimes that were previously relegated to the “closed with no investigation” file. While the current Sheriff has created most of his own budgeting problems, cutting funding for programs that help put burglars behind bars is a poor choice for the taxpayers. Garcia could easily trim fat from his bloated command staff and instead put dollars to work solving crimes and putting more boots on the ground. That would have a real impact of improving public safety in Harris County.” Louis GuthrieWe talked about the budget for quite some time. I was impressed with his detailed knowledge of how the department works, down to the supplies issued each deputy. I was a bit surprised by this because his highest rank in the department had been Lieutenant and budgeting is typically done by the Captains. He told me that he took it upon himself as a Lt. to break down the numbers passed down by his Captain because he wanted to be certain that taxpayer money was being utilized efficiently.Two things jump out at Grits here. First is Guthrie's utterly unrealistic portrayal of the budget, pretending that demoting a few senior commanders will allow him to put more "boots on the ground" at a time when the county is paying millions annually in overtime to staff the jail (which is the 800 lbs. gorilla dominating the Sheriff's budget). I replied thusly in the comments:
I would also like to give you my heartfelt thanks, having spent long hours (ok, minutes) conversing with various acquaintances about the possible purposes of the 'fat lamppost' I'd passed. On the night I saw your presence on twitter I was all set out to go out and stick a post-it note on aforesaid pipe reading "please, what is this for?" before you enlightened me.

“Frankly, I would just say to you, this is about saving lives. Jobs are very important; we created jobs,” Jackson Lee said. “But even the title of their legislation, H.R. 2, ‘job-killing’ — this is killing Americans if we take this away, if we repeal this bill.”

Ingrid played by herself for a long time this morning, she got into my button stash. It's amazing how simple things like buttons or scraps of fabric can keep her occupied for ages! I used the time she was busy and Otis was sleeping to make my living room curtains.
What he will say may sound new to the few Americans who watch congressional hearings. It won’t even reach those who have already given up on Afghanistan and are ready for our troops to come home. It will sound new — but it isn’t.
Be on the lookout for pantry staples. Yay! These diamonds in the aspartame-blanketed rough are more common than you might believe. Currently (4/14/10), in my alarm clock stack, I have coupons for bread, olive oil, sour cream, butter, soy milk, mustard, dried beans, chocolate chips, cooking spray, corn starch, baking powder, rice, pasta, and egg noodles. Not to mention tin foil, gum, deodorant, and the all-important Zyrtec (a brand we will not forgo).
A law to end ‘libel tourism’ and protect free speech will be published today. The Defamation Bill will shake up antiquated libel laws to prevent wealthy individuals and corporations – often based abroad – using courts here to silence critics.

Not all ethnically related violence is genocide, though sometimes people speak as if it were. And sometimes people use “genocide” as if it were not ethnic violence at all. All killing of other human beings is evil, but not all killing of other human beings is genocide. And so it is good to be reminded of what genocide really means.
One of the greatest lessons you can learn in life is the fact that no one is responsible for your life but you…. You are responsible for every aspect of your life; how you feel, how you think, what you do, the decisions you make and the impact on your life those decisions will have. You are responsible for the direction of your life, for structuring your life with balance and harmony and for nurturing your health and emotional well-being.
Now, Todd and Aimee are No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em poker crack whores, like The Man and I. We were there to see each other, obviously, but we were also there to PLAY CARDS. I downloaded a list of every Hold 'Em tournament that was held, in every hotel, and it became our trip bible.
Toni weighed up her options quickly. True, it would mean being stuck with this idiot for an extra 10 minutes or so, but with no buses back to her house for another hour, it would save her a fair bit of time. “Okay,” she sighed with resignation, and watched as he quickly pulled his mobile out to call for a cab.
Not great, but better!

Some more Beer Karma. I was sorting out the beer selection for the Beer Dinner at The Courthouse Restaurant featuring Spring Beers and had decided on Jamieson Raspberry Ale for the dessert. It just so happened that I had a couple left in the fridge from my recent visit and I thought to myself, “well, that’s as good an excuse as any to crack one and remember what it tastes like – for research purposes, of course!”
Degradation, humiliation and name calling was Denver’s favorite tools. Making her perform sexually acts against her will. Demanding that everything in the house be done, just as he had instructed. He knew how to control her by constantly criticizing, insulting and belittling Grace. Nothing was ever good enough for Denver. The pushing, shoving, slapping, punching, kicking and choking had become their way of life. Denver actually believed that she belonged to him. He thought he had Grace trained, as you would train a dog, to do whatever he said without question. Grace’s life was in turmoil. She was at her wit’s end. She began fantasizing about how to get out of the terrible situation that she had eagerly gotten herself into.
As you could probably tell by the absurdity of the sentences, I’ve created a few random sentence generators to do my bidding. How ironic it would be if there were grammar mistakes in this post. In fact I’m sure there are…

They are not so much a driving force, but a character dragged along by the plot.

Every morning I wake up and the first thing I feel is some kind of pain. Then anxiety. It makes me feel like what did I fight so hard for? I have nothing left I can enjoy! I can’t have sex, and when I can it will be painful. I can’t look attractive, I can’t eat food I like because it fucks up my blood sugar and causes too many infections. I can’t take drugs because of the side effects. I feel I have no future, marriage and children are very much so out of the question. Not many of my friends and family are as supportive as they once were. I can’t even enjoy the money I make because I am barely staying afloat, with back bills, medicine and rent and shit. The only thing I get to do that makes me happy is I occasionally get to go to a casino and stare at the slots and gamble. Even that is very limited because of money. I wanted to travel after all this, but I can’t! Money and medicine prohibit that too. Chemo seemed easy compared to the aftermath. Now what the fuck do I do?

A few nights ago I was lamenting the fact that I had no brooding hens, and thus no tiny chicks to bring into the house and cuddle. Yes, I know that sounds strange, but ever since I can remember I’ve loved baby chicks — they are soooooo cute!
Every year I try to grow basil and every year I fail… I’m not sure if it’s because I get greedy and eat too much of it or maybe I under fertilize or over water? Or maybe there’s too much sun or too little?
“On Corn Island they have limited resources and it can be difficult getting the flow of medical equipment and medication to the clinic.” Dr. Alan says.

As usual, there's plenty to do on this snowy weekend, but I'm starting a barrage of calendar posts with a special event: Crown Writes: A Local Literary Talent Showcase on Saturday night at LaunchPad. Organized by Crown Heights writer extraordinaire Victoria Cho, who has appeared at the Franklin Park Reading Series and leads the Crown Heights Writing Workshop, the event will feature four alumni of the workshop sharing a mix of fiction and non-fiction. Yours truly will be reading - can't reveal exactly what, but if you like you what you read in this space, you'll most probably enjoy it.
Because Arnett signed a National Letter of Intent in February, he is subject to eligibility ramifications if he does not complete a full year at UT. It could, perhaps, be in his best interest to go through spring semester and spring football at UT before signing elsewhere.
Parliament, the senate and the cabinet get together with the prime minister. They look to the economy. They look to the industry. They look to the resources. All is well. They promise to us a bright future. “There is a way that seemeth right unto a man.” They, likeLot, make peace with the enemies of God. They meet with the various leaders of world cultures and religions seeking mutual understanding and cooperation. There is a way that seemeth right unto a man.
So please, give this cake a try. It got rave reviews on epicurious.com so I knew it would be a winner. I took note of the remarks about too much butter and sugar for the topping so I cut down the amounts by half and I'm glad I did. This revised amount is perfect.

Violet is awful. And like her best friend Phoebe, I mostly mean that as a compliment. She is not subtle and she takes out her pain at being abandonned by her father out on everyone around her (even if, like her half-sisters and Phoebe, they do not deserve it). But she is truly creative in driving away her mother’s horrible boyfriends and in punishing her absent dad. I can’t help but smile at the mischief she gets into. And it’s hard to be truly mad at her because her pain and her secret wish to see her family reunited are clear in her every action (even if they are not always clear to her).
A basic principle of economic theory is that competition — or the threat of competition — is good for consumers. Monopolies facing no such threat are generally bad.

I went to a memorial service this weekend for an old college friend's husband. They were married ten years ago. He took his own life after many tumultuous years battling alcohol addiction, and left two young kids behind. The memorial service was held in the little theater where the two of them had been married (a VERY fun wedding, performed like a play with Act I and Act II and everything...awesome!)

I can imagine what type of derogatory spin would be put on the portrayal of these real Christian women if “GCB” was the inspiration.
The bracelet on the lower left is a stretch bracelet made of felted balls with seed beads attached. These were sold as trim in packets at a craft store. I tried spacers between the balls but decided I liked this look best. It may not be worn often as I don't know how well it will hold up, but was very inexpensive and will be fun to wear when I go to my knitting group.

As Pollan tells it, the killing of the feral pigs was an ecological necessity, and the animal protectionists show themselves to be at odds with nature, focusing exclusively on the individuals and neglecting the species in their opposition. A closer look would have told a different story, one in which the “animal people” were less single-minded and the ecological science was clouded by political calculation and human interest. Only by giving us a very superficial look at the story is Pollan able to use it to support his point.
Last month I reviewed the Houglass Eye Shadow Duo in Prism. I loved the packaging and colors, the shadows were exquisite... but I thought, for the money, I needed something more neutral that I would wear every day.
The Third World is different -- different peoples with different pasts and different cultures. Yet Westerners continue to mistake the psychology of the Third World and its peoples. Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe are perfect examples of those mistakes. Sierra Leone is in perpetual civil war, and Zimbabwe -- once thriving, stable Rhodesia -- is looting the very people (the white men) who feed the country. Yet Westerners do not admit that the same kind of savagery could come to America when enough immigrants of the right type assert themselves. The fact is, Americans are sitting ducks for Third World exploitation of the Western conscience of compassion.
As the proud mom of a boy I'm always on the lookout for books that celebrate boys--so today I'm thrilled to announce our latest craft book, Sewing for Boys. In this first-ever "boys-only" sewing book, you'll find 24 projects—ranging from sporty to dapper—to create an entire handmade wardrobe little boys will love. The projects/ patterns span all seasons and also include specialty items for playtime, art, and "on the go" accessories. The clothing (ranging from baby to age 7) is comfortable, durable, and completely unique. From a retro button-down shirt and suspender shorts to a just-like-dad robe, these 24 sewing projects will keep the boys in your life dressed with style year-round. My favorites are the fisherman hat (shown on the cover) and the treasure-pocket pants that feature the biggest pockets ever for boys to fill!

The case has become a national issue, and the slain teen’s parents have both quit their jobs to help see that the fight for justice continues. In that effort, they have allowed their lawyers to set up a donation fund for the legal costs, but now they fear that other fake sites have sprung up, hoping to profit from the national outrage.

My concept is to take lots of photos over the 10 days of the Festival, of residents, authors and visitors staring into the lens of my camera. And each day I plan on printing out the photos and pinning them to the walls. The idea is that the people in Wigtown during the event become artwork. And as the walls will fill up with all these faces and it will become something of an immersive environment.
The focus point of this documentary will be on the participants of this event. The issue covered in this documentary has a relatively light-hearted background on a global scale and will concentrate on the drive and motivation to participate in such a barbarian event in a modern society. This includes the question of why would an individual go through this pain, which is associated with this physical and mental challenge. Gathering information about different types of personal preparation, capturing opinions and emotions on the event day and evaluating post-event effects will help to illuminate this matter.

The idea behind the blog is simple: take an old picture, go to the place where it was taken, line it up to against the frame of the location, and take another picture. You then get a picture of a picture, only this one carries a bit more weight with the now apparent passage of time.
In some regions of Australia, illegal brothels are a boom industry as a result of systemic police corruption, that renders current laws nothing but lip service and the promise of stricter laws, just a red herring.
A plate of canelés were handed around and I admit I didn't believe it at first when I told they were made by Mr Egg. Canelés are one of my favourite treats, custardy baked pastries with a dark and chewy caramelised crust. The mixture is made from milk, flour, sugar, rum and vanilla.

My blogger friend Tiffany had her big day on her blog today. A site featured her blog and she is getting a ton of traffic. Stop by and see her... she made treats for us and even cleaned for her special bloggy party. :-) Elasta mom is her blog and its worth the click to check her out and leave her a comment telling her I sent you. If you blog much you know how fun it is to get comments and we need to make this a record comment day for her. We've joked that there are so many blogs that are so fake and annoying get huge traffic. It feels a little like going back to high school and the popularity contest. I promise Tiffany is as real as they come. Her daughter has Cru du Chat and Tiffany beautifully share the story of the daily grind with a nice optimistic spin.
Gradually we discover that this love and longing slowly and often painfully destroy all our outer and inner attachments, all the images we may have of our self. The Sufis call this process being taken into the tavern of ruin, through which we are eventually made empty of all except divine love, divine presence.

My parents, who because I live with them at the moment have a front-row seat to the dire straights of my dating life, have taken pity on me. I can’t quite work out if it is sweet or completely insulting.
The next offense is to go too far in the other direction. If your shoes look like they belong on tour with the Stones or something Mystery would wear, again – you’re doing it wrong. Super slim shoes with pointy elf toes look retarded. These are the shoes you find in most places that are a step up from Wal Mart or Target. Most of Aldo or Calvin Klein’s stuff will look like this. Avoid them.

Anxiety’s in full swing tonight as I debut a piece of poetry I wrote years ago. It’s never seen the light of day. It’s as pasty as they come. And yet, there’s something about it I’ve always secretly admired. It’s concise—even raw—in a way only poetry can be. Don’t get me wrong. It’s more worthy of the “critical” than the “acclaim”. It might even smack of corniness. (Although, honestly, I think that’s a standard feature of poetry. That, and berets. And smoky coffee shops. And snaps instead of claps.) It’s also a weird free verse that might not even be poetry at all. In fact, I’m almost positive it’s not. Nonetheless, it represents the time I started spiralling deeper into depression and social anxiety. The time I’ve never quite recovered from. For that, it deserves a good, long breath of fresh air.

Normally at the Marriott Copley Place, wired internet is complimentary and wireless internet costs ~US$14 a night. Thankfully, wireless internet was complimentary for all guests who were registered with our conference. That was a godsend because I didn’t want to pay for roaming charges or did I want to go into the lobby just use the Internet.

In a jealous rage, Cain murdered Abel, becoming the first human being to take the life of another. He forever stands as a testimony to the utter tragedy of attempting to please God apart from true faith. For “without faith,” Hebrews 11:6says, “it is impossible to please Him.” Cain tried and failed–as have millions who have followed in his footsteps.
So I am at a crossroad. I know that I have to take a stand with my Church, and a church that I have struggled with since I was pointed in that direction. Easier said than done.

6. Check out and RUN!!!!!: All the homework and navigation strategy is an attempt to cut down on the time you spend hunting in IKEA because often the checkout lines are long and slow on the weekends. This is the only thing you cannot control during your visit here. My suggestion is to make sure your small items are on the top of your cart so you can feed them to the cashier first to get things going. Also, make sure that all the labels are facing the same way to make it easy for the cashier to scan your big boxes.
A simple water and vinegar solution works well as a glass cleanser, and it’s easy on the environment. If glass and Perspex is heavily scratched, not much can be done in the way of repairs. The best course of action is to guard against damage in the first place by applying a clear silicon spray or polish to the windows and cleaning them with a soft, non-abrasive cloth.

Holy affections are practical and obedient in their application. Christ taught that obedience was not avoiding active sins, but also acting in pure ways: “I was hungry, and you gave me no meat” (Matt. 25:31-46). Omission is sinful as much as commission.[13] Thus, the Christian life is fruitful and powerful in its actions. This lends to the practicality of spiritual knowledge and the holy affections.
Finally, I can’t express how much I like the scenes between Mi Roo and her mom. Mi Roo’s curious about her mom’s life and a part of her wonders what her mom was like as a young adult. Does Mi Roo resemble her? I know I’ve had those thoughts about my mom as well. Was she a feminist? Was she a serial dater? Was she ambitious about her career? Growing up with this woman, I know her as the nurturer. To suddenly think of your mom as a person who had a life before you came along is a little mindboggling. And so it reminded me of my heart to hearts with my mom.

Gordon Lish was no one-off. There are excellent editors in every imprint of every trade publishing house, who improve every book they work on, but they are under threat. The consolidation of the industry led to downsizing, and many talented editors were let go. Some ended up at other houses, while others founded their own small presses, or became agents. Many, however, were lost to the business forever. And one of my fears is, with the inevitable next round of lay-offs, we may lose a lot more.
Health issues can also come to us in a random manner. It was not my intention to neglect my blog so much. And it was not my intention to neglect a lot of other things… Obstacles that work against creativity can take many different and unexpected forms; this is what I have been finding out for the past five weeks. Sometimes, after a while – if you are lucky – the very same obstacles can function as chances, as possibilities, as new ideas for new projects. It’s a random thing… (And for the time being: I just have to be patient and trust the Dutch health system_)

Unlike JJS, DFW’s writing style is neurotic, self-relfexive, and saturated with a hyper-self consciosness that overthinks most everything he perceives and adds layers and layers of information for his reader via footnotes, footnotes-within-footnotes, and parenthetical asides – sprinkled liberally with Latinate and French phrases (ad hominem, ad nauseam, raison d-etre). Also, DFW doesn’t really seem to connect with any of the people he interviews; actually, most of the time it seems he is making fun of them or giving them some abstract name, like Native Companion (the pseudonym he gives to his former high school friend that accompanies him to the Illinois State Fair). DFW’s tempo, too is different: a kind of cerebral hyper-drive, like he’s on speed transferring all of his skull’s pyschobabble onto the page.

Fourth, that this period of 2,520 solar years are identical to what Jesus referred to when he used the expression translated “the appointed times of the nations” or “the times of the Gentiles” in Luke 21:24 (“Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled…”), even though Jesus was specifically discussing the future destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 AD, not its past destruction by Babylon, and despite the fact that there is not a single word in Scripture, Jewish tradition or Christian writings that indicates that the “Gentile times” refer to any time period during which God’s eternal kingdom would be inactive.

When considering the difference between what government representatives will say about pensions vs. what the industry says keep in mind that it is the role of government to keep the public calm while they try to figure things out – they will always say, as they did in 1929 and again in 2008, that “the fundamentals are sound”.

The preliminary rent hike, approved on Tuesday, May 3rd, 2011 by the RGB is slated to be voted on next month. The board proposed changes to both one-year and two-year lease agreements.

The only thing that would have made drinking this beer more enjoyable would have been consuming it at the brewery, enjoying a plate of farm-to-the-table plate cuisine with old friends and a perhaps few new ones. So do yourself a favor, go down to your local farmers market, pick up some in-produce, call up some friends, and pick up a bottle or two of this beer from your local craft beer vendor. Cook, open, and enjoy.

We took the girls to a playground in the shopping centre. We ran into a friend of a friend who had had her babies at home in New Zealand. When Sazz went to the toilets I said “but who will catch the baby?” turned to face this friend of a friend and jokingly asked “you’ll catch the baby, right?” She didn’t think it was that funny.

Every kids reacts differently and in some cases the subsequent damage is not able to be seen. So when I hear the words “well my child has all their vaccines and is fine” I cringe, ……… just a little. Just because your child is strong enough, lucky enough, or not damaged to a visible degree, does not in any way prove that vaccines are safe. You could take a bottle of sleeping pills and die. I could do the same and live. On your terms it would be concluded; Therefore it is completely safe to take a bottle of pills. No side effects whatsoever.
When I got married I was naive ( stupid) enough to think that after marrying my Mr Right my life would be like a fairy tale with us living happily ever after.So expectations were riding high.Big mistake.Every birthday,anniversary or any special day I used to keep my expectation so high that anything that was done for me failed to really impress me.(Though looking back I now realise H really did try his best) I wanted everything to be perfect. Candle light dinners, long romantic drives ,movies on week ends ,stuff like that.But after long working hours on weekdays who has time and energy left for all that? So none of these things happened.And I was dissapointed. I cribbed and complained to my best friend. And she said ‘ Do you think you do everything perfectly all the time?’ and that struck me. I realised that even I am not perfect.I can’t cook.I am pathetic at household chores ( now improving though) but still when it comes to expecting I expect a lot without actually looking at the fact that I am also not able to live upto all his expectations all the time.I was suddenly ashamed of myself. After that I consciously started appreciating the things he did for me and kept a check on my critisism and things improved. Since I didn’t expect much anything nice that he did used to come as a pleasant surprise. I still fall and fumble on the way and sometimes expect a little too much but I try and keep these occasions to the minimum.I have learnt my lesson the hard way and hope to remember it forever.

That is what I'd always thought, if I thought about it at all. But the reports of the shipwreck of the Concordia give another account of who commands. There seems to have been a complete breakdown of responsibilities. Having hit the Island of Giglio at 28 kilometres an hour, bringing the ship's speed instantly to 6 kilometres an hour (imagine being inside with no warning, not wearing your seatbelt would take on forceful meaning) the captain is reported to have got on the phone to the director of marine operations of the company that owned the boat. And stayed on the phone for three calls-worth plus a call from a retired former captain in Grosseto. The Second Officer has gone down to the engine room and found it full of water - and all electrical power sources flooded - the only power was a small emergency generator elsewhere in the ship. He tells the bridge that the ship is without any means of control. And the captain gets on the phone again.

Simple Fractions – A pizza is shared between pirates on a beach and in a boat. Children tap each slice to feed the pirates on the beach, who walk away as they are fed. They are then asked to select the fraction that indicates how much remains for those in the boat. A six-sliced pizza might first feed 2 pirates on the beach, and then the child would need to select 4/6 to show the remainder. If they are correct, the pirates in the boat cheer, eat the pizza and row away. An incorrect answer will cause a cannon ball to sink their boat. If children have forgotten how many slices they started with (necessary to indicate the denominator), a faint image remains behind to help with counting.

Dogfish Head World Wide Stout is the strongest beer I have ever drank in my entire life. At 18% ABV this one will surely mess you up by the time you hit the halfway mark of drinking it.

Christian wins the match by DQ….which means….he is the World Heavyweight Champion. What triggered Randy off is Christian spitting on Randy. Another great match between these two, and the Chicago crowd loved seeing Christian as the new champion. Even after the match, Randy attacks Christian and puts him up on the Spanish Announce Table. Teddy Long comes out to try to plead with Randy, but it doesn’t work, he gives Christian a RKO, but the table doesn’t break. That has to hurt.

2). The claim also shows very little knowledge of conservatism, and of American conservatism in particular. Reagan's "America first" strategy is in fact a good example of the isolationism that ruled among American conservatives right up until Sept. 11, 2001. American conservatives have always wanted to let the rest of the world to go to hell in its own way and it was DEMOCRAT presidents that got America into both world wars, Korea and Vietnam. America normally has to be under serious threat of some kind for American conservatives to take any notice of the rest of the world at all. Even the 1898 ouster of the pathetic Spanish presence in Cuba had to be preceded by a Spanish "attack" on the battleship Maine. So it was only Saddam's serious threat to oil supplies that got George Bush Senior into the first Gulf war and even then he pulled out as soon as the threat was removed. It was only when 9/11 showed beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt that America was under serious and lasting threat from implacable Islamic hatred that George Bush II began his interventions in the Islamic world.

Shin points to the success of NASA’s science mission directorate in identifying scientific needs and defining missions that should be pursued. “We want to mimic that in aerospace, but there are naysayers,” he says. “We need to have this meeting of minds, to identify what needs to be taken to a higher TRL. NASA, Boeing or the Defense Department cannot do it alone; it has to be a community effort,” he says.

I rarely do personal posts on this blog, but I thought this one may be worth sharing. The last 6 months I have been shedding my old body. It was a lazy body. It was a body that miscarried, held years of hormones due to fertility treatments, a body that wouldnt allow me to do outdoor sports with my family, a body that embarrassed me. In October, something FINALLY clicked. So I got to work.

Which brings me to reader expectation. Readers want good stories. They expect to be able to get them. You want reader expectation to be high. If they perceive value, they’re willing to pay more. Self-publishing has been working against this perception of value. Let’s face it, one doesn’t expect much for a dollar. It’s an impulse, throw away value item. One doesn’t expect much for a dollar and one isn’t terribly disappointed if one doesn’t receive much for that investment. Self-publishing is playing off this idea of giving a valuable item at a throw away price in order to generate interest in the product.

Happy Monday Blog Friends! Did you have a nice weekend? Mine was pretty great, eventuful and yet relaxing which is always the BEST combination (IMO).
The Slade Avenue Mansion is going to become a Mosque. Now for the interests of clarity, allow me to explain a few things about the Slade Avenue Mansion; I have no idea what the Slade Avenue mansion once was before it was an unsuccessful assisted living home for the elderly – I vaguely remember my father telling me something about it being the house of department store owners, and that makes sense, no rich goy would have lived that close to a Jewish country club before 1970, and the only Jews who’d had enough wealth in the early twentieth century to afford the Slade Avenue Mansion would have been department store owners. What I do know is that it was suggested by a couple people in real estate that my family firm - Deronda Corp - buy the Slade Avenue Mansion and try to find occupants to rent. I was not at the meeting, but I do recall that my father’s response was “Hell No.”
As it turned out, my teacher, Akash, was a native Punjabi speaker! He was an international student from Deradun, in northern India, who was in his final year in a computer science degree. I also noticed he was wearing a kara, the steel bangle which is one of the "five Ks," symbols of Sikhism. Because Akash was clean-shaven, though, I assumed he either wasn't part of the Khalsa (the Sikh lay priesthood) or else wasn't orthodox.
I dont know where to start on this. It's been three weeks, and thankfully I have a enough of positive going on in my life so that I don't have to think about what could have been, but let me say this, I've explained to friends and family what happened with seriousness and jokes and the fact is a group of guys with nothing better to do decided to exert power over my life for a few moments and of course looking at it personally, I can't help but think crime is what's up in the Franklin Avenue section of Crown Heights.
A The key to avoiding potential misunderstanding or conflict is to have a clear policy in advance and communicate this to all staff – that way, everyone knows where they stand and you look after your business needs. Your policy need not be very complicated – a simple process of ‘first come, first served’ may be enough.
Does this mean that privacy on the Web is a lost cause? Not at all. What it means is that the best way to protect your privacy on the Internet is the same as the way you protect your privacy in normal life—through your behavior. Read the privacy statements on the websites you visit, and only do business with ones whose practices you agree with. If you’re worried about cookies, disable them. Most importantly, avoid indiscriminate Web surfing—recognize that just as most cities have a bad side of town that’s best avoided, the Internet does too. But if it’s complete and total anonymity you want, better start looking for that cave.
Israel, as a nation, had committed the unpardonable sin by speaking against the Holy Spirit. They did this at the time of the stoning of Stephen in Acts 7. Stephen accused them by saying in verse 51. “Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost. As your fathers did so do ye.” Christ had said in Matthew 12:32,

Jimmie Driftwood was born James Corbit Morris on 20 June 1907 in Timbo, Arkansas. He wrote over 6,000 folk songs, including The Battle Of New Orleans. Some people believe he wrote this song in 1936, but didn't do anything with it until 21 years later.
Over the last four weeks I struggled to remember my cofffee mugs and shopping bags but I finally got the hang of it. I even got my roommates to take part. It took some convincing at first, one of my roommates likes to argue and was sure that he was being more sustainable by getting the small plastic grocery sacks. His arguement behind this was that he reuses the bags as garbage sacks for our bathroom and if he didn’t get those bags he would just have to buy small garbage bags, doubling our waste. I proved to him that yes, reusing is sustainable, but reducing is better. I drove the point home by showing him just how many plastic bags we have saved up over the last two years. Our drawer is still overflowing so I pulled the bags out and counted. When I reached 100 bags (with more still in the drawer), I made the arguement that we maybe reuse two small sacks a month. So we still have over 50 months worth of garbage sacks and we really don’t need to be getting anymore. After this, both my roommates were happy to help me reduce our use and started using our shopping bags as well. We are even going to go on family shopping trips down to the Saturday farmers market, with our reusable bags, as much as possible.
We got through it, together…and in an unexpected way, we were graced with the realization that he was still very much there with us.

The bigs and I came home and we ate dinner as a family. The girls hit the tub while I picked up and put the tiniest of the babes to bed. All four older girls wanted to sleep together (this has become a weekend ritual) so they did. Today, my husband and I moved these beds from the other side of the room to where you see them here. Holy Heavy Bunks Batman. Would you believe I was able to lift my end of the bed up off the ground and on top of the bottom bunk? I couldn't believe it when I accomplished that!

I bought it on the QutieLand Website. I've heard that QutieLand is a good shipping service site, but that it's a little bit expensive. I've never tried any other shipping service yet so I can't really tell the difference. I live in Canada and their shipping fee is almost always around $30. I've paid the JSK about $88, which is so cheap compared to the original, but they do warn us that the quality might not be very great.

I clam up. I'm pathetic. I know life isn't a bed of roses; I learned that when Amy was diagnosed with autism. But I know The Farmer is worried. He made a will, something that he knows should have been done years ago yet has taken a routine operation to spur him into action. He's 62. He had a heart attack about thirteen years ago and though this operation is nothing to do with his heart, it's still an issue when he'll be under anaesthetic. It seems like there's always something; something to deal with that isn't your average every day stuff. And I don't know how to deal with it. I've buried my head in the sand, all the while knowing how concerned and anxious my husband is. He knows I'm worried but I'm trying to be brave; I'm trying to pretend that I'm not nervous about him being out of action for six weeks, about him being a hospital inpatient for at least four days. I've got just under a week to get my head out of the sand and act like a grown up, and a wife. Right now I feel like a frightened little girl, wondering if life will ever be the same. I want to say I can cope and I want so much to say everything will be okay. But inside I'm breaking up. I want to stop thinking another man in my life may leave me. So you think I'm being melodramatic? Try living in my head where the sun always shines and meadows beckon me to twirl round to heavenly music. I'll stay optimistic. And I'll keep telling myself that my romantic notions have worth; then I'll fall asleep and wake up to the sound of life beside me.

The orchestra moved to Hollywood, California, and we settled in a hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. We would walk about eight blocks to the rehearsal hall to practice every night. We were about four guys to a room that was supposed to hold one person. We had a drag queen living across the hall, drugs were openly sold and used on the premises, homosexuality was practiced by so-called celibate followers in the orchestra, and, on top of all this, we were supposed to meditate and attain enlightenment. What a crock!

So that’s Black Sabbath, and wasn’t it wonderful? It’s nice to go back to a time when horror movies were geared to be fun, like campfire tales. Too many modern movies in the genre forgo that aspect for extremity and overly serious tones that just end up falling flat and coming off as immature. So this was a treat, and if you love old horror you will dig the hell out of this. Plus, it inspired a great band!

Kenny made four changes from the semi bringing in Maxi, Enrique, Kuyt and Reina who was back from suspension, no room for sentiment it appears as Doni, also back from the naughty step, was preferred over Brad Jones as back up. Steven Gerrard had picked up a slight knock so was rested. I suspect Roy Hodgson was perhaps a little more sensitive about the reception he might receive from the Liverpool fans than his pre match utterings suggested. However he need not have worried, as they showed distinctly more class than their Aston Villa counterparts did with Martin O’Neill, by giving him a warm welcome.

For an entire year, the director scouted out villages in Hunsrück (between the Mosel and Rhine rivers in southwestern Germany). Reitz had to carefully plan shooting and arrange with villagers to disturb their daily lives as little as possible, as a large film crew can easily disrupt the life of a small community — the cast alone was composed of 200 actors and actresses, and as many as 5,000 extras. The ‘peaceful’ countryside posed special problems of its own for the film crew. Apart from noisy farm machinery, the director had to contend with the unwanted sounds emanating from a nearby American airbase. Pre-production was followed by two years of shooting (268 days of actual filming) and two years of post-production. During production, Reitz had to scramble to put together financing for the £2m budget project, minuscule by today’s standards. Heimat 1 was released in theatres for a year before being televised. Attracting on average 12 million viewers each evening it was broadcast, Heimat 1 became the greatest success story in the history of German television.

Nice main drag with a few restaurants, bars, storefront, etc. Very charming to say the least!

This book would have taken me by surprise, but the high ratings and praise made me pretty confident that it would live up to the hype. Though I’m capable of thinking for myself, I have to side with the majority here. It’s a fantastic new series and it’s definitely one of my favorite dystopian novels. Maybe it’s because I’m a sucker for all things paranormal and this book blends both elements perfectly? I’m not going to try to figure it out, but it just works. Every time I had to put the book down, I really didn’t want to. And if that’s not a sign of a good read, I don’t really know what is.

I realized it after the item(s) sold, and then it's too late!

More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death; in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.

Wanna know why I think romance gets a bad rap? Fair warning: I'm about to step up on a feminist soapbox, but if you read me regularly that shouldn't be much of a shock. Romance is a genre largely written by women, for women. Never mind that it's basically keeping the publishing industry afloat: it's for GIRLS, ewwwwww! Because women can't possibly know what they want, physically, emotionally, and sexually. Because there's no way writing and editing a romance novel isn't damn difficult. Because (and this is a literary argument as old as time), the female experience can't be universal.

The deeper connection and more profound love that develops in relationships after the initial “in love” phase can also be a source of sexual desire, but sometimes we must retrain our brains for this. It’s very easy and natural to feel such desire for someone new or forbidden. It’s chemical. It’s biological. It’s easy, and it can be very hard, especially if a the relationship ends before it can grow into a more comfortable zone.

Current obsession II: Ratings for movies and video games (“If it says ‘T’ that is for teens, and I don’t understand why I can play it and not be a teen,” he says.)
After a birthday celebrating weekend and mega-stress from life, I ended up gaining a couple of pounds back. Yeah, I’m a little disappointed that I found myself finishing off some of the comfort food that we had leftover (as a snack), but now I know that I don’t have to let that defeat me. I can get back on the healthy eating track and I will.
Shieldfield is a small area of Newcastle upon Tyne located just to the east of the City Centre, from which it is separated by the A167(M) Central Motorway. The Sandyford, Heaton, Byker and Manors areas of the city border Shieldfield to the North, East, South East and South.
I stepped in and tried to be the arbiter, but, to no avail. Because the girls were kicking such serious ass, we had to change the rules to appease the male-folk lol. Even if I think this is our last game of Charades, I'm sure we'll come up with new and better ways to instigate genitalia-rivalry.
Despite recent form, Woods has had an ocean full of injuries that would only give pleasure to a hypochondriac. First of all – while playing in the final round of the US Open back in May of 2008 when he injured his knee. He then went in for ACL reconstructive surgery later that year. In December of 2008, again he tore his Achilles tendon- fears of a reoccurring injury after he pulled out of the WGC-Cadillac Championship.
In comparison to the previous divas mentioned, Miley Cyrus has the potential for true greatness as she has attached herself to a world-wide movement that advocates not just for humanitarianism and charity but for political and social empowerment. There is one kind of love that people have for celebrities that contribute toward charity and embrace the status quo, there is quite another sort of love that the people have for celebrities who are willing to challenge the status quo and put their own reputations of the line for the cause of the poor and the working classes.

It’s not a great time to be holding this Euro survival view at the moment with Spanish and Italian bonds selling off recently but these yields won’t go above 7%. The ECB made sure of that before Christmas and if nothing was done to support them at these levels then they would be wasting all the previous good work.
I had to do something with the Buff rooster
Yesterday my family had their Easter dinner (we celebrated it a week late because of people's schedules) and I had a chance to use the lovely deviled egg plate that my grandmother gave to my mother and I. I love it for so many reasons. It's colourful, it's perfect for Easter, and it holds 24 deviled eggs, unlike the regular 12 that other plates hold. That meant that we were able to bring all of our deviled eggs on one plate, rather than half on a plate and half in a container.
Luckily, no one was hurt in the freak accident, though the massive hole displaced a family of six, which had to be evacuated with aid of the fire department.

I've shifted my personal @newalbanian Twitter feed from Potable Curmudgeon to NA Confidential, and replaced it here at the beer blog with @nabcnews. This makes more sense, because I'm tending to tweet about local affairs and politics.

Over the next few days a bunch of the other Horde leaders came by to meet her and pay their respects, which I’ll admit was pretty cool of them, and she seemed to like Baine especially, gave him the whole “nice young man” deal that old ladies love to throw around. And everyone was nice to her, don’t get me wrong, but like…I mean, I know I can get cranky sometimes, but I really try to watch my mouth around Greatmother. Not least of all because if she catches me swearing she used to give me a good hard yank by my ponytail, which was one of the main reasons I cut it off eventually, but I’m also not in much of a hurry to find out what she would come up with for Plan B now that it’s gone. So anyway, I try to rein it in when I’m around her, but I swear the other leaders were making a point of giving me bad news in front of her and just generally saying things to see if they could set me off. Vol’jin especially. Meanwhile Greatmother just seemed to get a kick out of everyone. I don’t think she’s really clear on what the Forsaken actually are, though, what with her calling Sylvanas “that nice elf girl” that seems like she could use some sun. (More like she could use some SunWELL, am I right? OH YEAH I WENT THERE.) I’m thinking it’s just as well that I don’t clear that one up for her.

On top of checking off a few things from our punch list, my project for the weekend is to finally design our bedroom curtains. Because...I finally did it...I bought fabric! Woo hoo!! Ok, maybe picking fabric isn't so exciting to you. J couldn't care less when I told him. But, I've been indecisive for so long, our neighbors live just a little too close for comfort, and I hate our current excuse for curtains sooo...

Throne of the Crescent Moon evokes an old school Arabian setting with a touch of Egyptian while building a fresh world and history all its own filled with ghuls (zombies), lion shapeshifters, and a ghul hunter who has been there and done that so much I kept waiting for him to belt out the immortal Danny Glover line "I'm getting too old for this shit."
Fourth, the content hits directly on a real challenge of philanthropy - one that I first encountered in my dissertation research - the whole concept of "problem definition." At the time I was interested in this in terms of the power dynamics - "He who gets to define the problem generally gets to define his preferred solution." Of course, Lee is asking me (us?) to consider the feasibility of actually solving problems - in terms of resources and time horizons and the philanthropic reality versus rhetoric of metrics this has real implications.

What the heck did we buy during the lonely month of January that ran us nearly 20% of our monthly income? Can we say, poor money management? Granted some of it was clothing for the girls but clearly that total exceeds any sort of monthly clothing budget that I would set (and will be setting)! Plus this includes some Valentine props purchased for the business. I included them here b/c they were absolutely not necessary and I could have easily conducted the sessions without making further purchases.This is a large amount of dollars to throw out the window. Imagine we had put this toward our debt in addition to the snowball amount? Wow, what a difference that would make! My plan is, whenever I hear the green eyed monster whispering in my ear that I need to buy that adorable dress for Mad or those cute little sandals for Charlotte, I'm going to give him a good flick off my shoulder and promptly apply that money towards our debt. I would have spent that money anyway. And easily. Without so much as a thought. Or maybe with a thought...except that thought would have been saying "money, ha! you can make more of it. now speeeeend!" LOL!!

The thriller was thoroughly enjoyed. Crisp plot, remarkable twists, pretty good detailing (sometimes a bit too much of it), it felt more real than just a story. Certain places the author could’ve/ should’ve left open-ended sentences/plots for the reader to interpret or assume or imagine. This would’ve engaged the reader more.
Personal experience articles also fit well with Good Friday. When was the first time you realized the full significance of Jesus’ sacrifice? What does Good Friday mean to you? How did your view of Good Friday change after you committed your life to Christ? Do you keep any traditions for Good Friday? Do you use it as a time for confession and repentance?

Managing expectations better would help. We know this isn’t a normal job, and all self-employed people learn to manage for gaps in their income, but if producers don’t start making the prompt payment of writers a priority, I foresee a dark future where all television scripts are churned out either by people who live in bins and thus have no outgoings, or the JulianFellowesBot 3000. And I really don’t want to see any more series about footmen.

With a population of more than 190 million, Brazil is set to become one of the world’s top five economies. It is pursuing a bold future, and a key part of its strategy is a commitment to invest significant resources in higher education and research, particularly in so-called STEM disciplines: science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
"If we find ourselves engaging in radical modes of alternative education which don’t inherently challenge and disrupt crucial aspects of the world, then we should be concerned that we are actually reproducing the same structures which Unschooling was originally supposed to allow us to escape from. Thus, rather than having Unschooling be that thing which isn’t school or homeschooling, we should have Unschooling be something which, while growing out of critiques of industrial schooling and its sibling, homeschooling, defined in terms of what it allows us to become, and how it allows us to change the world."

Everyone wants and maybe needs the whole pie in their relationship but it again it varies from person to person. Some people are satisfied if just the financial side is being met. Others are happy if it’s the emotional and physical side is being met. There is no right or wrong way; you just have to figure out what is YOUR way. What do you need from a partner to be happy in a relationship? Is it just physical or is it all three or just two out of three? In the end knowing what you want and what your partner is willing to give is one way you can determine if your relationship is going to be successful. If your needs aren’t being met, for whatever reason COMMUNICATE this with your partner!!! Over time people change and their wants and needs become different, some in good ways other in bad ways. Make sure you keep the line of communication open with you partner. If you aren’t happy with an area of your relationship, let your partner know and work with them so that you are both happy and that you remain happy.

Enter Washed Out, a producer from the US who mastered the art of Chillwave to perfection. It’s bombastic, it creeps under your skin, you want to never leave your bed again in the morning. It really chills you out for good. Hard to admit, but this is great stuff. The 80ies have a clear and unmistakable influence, as do early 90ies ambient sounds, but what really stands out is the pop appeal that Trip Hop lost over 15 years ago. I’d advise everyone to go and get ‘Within and Without’, this year’s album. It won’t leave your player for quite a while, certainly not on Sunday mornings.

What might first strike you about this is the darker, more violent tone of the animated film. It is rated PG-13. So, it’s not a children’s film. There is blood and a guy getting set on fire. There’s brutality and murder. It has heavy themes rolling through it of death, murder, redemption, revenge, sorrow, grief, and regret. It is designed for a mature audience able to handle heavier subject matter, and grasp the emotional weight of the story.

The track is rather uneventful despite the hype (and, man, is the hype machine in high gear for everything Hunger Games). I doubt it will win over too many new fans. It’s a brooding little piece with string and hurdy-gurdy player Reginne Chassagne taking lead vocals. It seems to be all soft build-up to nothing … unless it serves as the prelude to the Kid Cudi song that follows it on the full soundtrack (Support the Independent Ethos, purchase on Amazon). It certainly has the Arcade Fire style, but it sounds like filler. Devotees should love it just for the fact that it is now closing on two years since Arcade Fire released any new music since the Suburbs (Why Arcade Fire deserved that Grammy [February 14, 2011]).

There has been something of a fightback from the traditional industry. They seem to have consolidated their investment around a highly focussed strategy where they spend a year building up to one big album release – like we saw with Lana Del Rey this year – while pretty much ignoring the rest of their catalogues. This is pretty clever, and it does seem to work, but it has had a bit of chilling effect on the explosion in alternatives that we saw a few years back. It’s increasingly hard for artists who aren’t interested in hoop jumping to break through to public exposure. So many magazines are only kept afloat by advertising from the industry they ‘criticize’ that they just retreat to trawling back catalogues for cover stars and saving up all their bile for people who aren’t subsidizing their lifestyles. Bookers can demand that festivals take their dull acts on Sunday afternoon as a condition of supplying their highly publicised headliners for Saturday night – effectively barring the way for better bands.

The above shots show the helix in position and the riser supports. There will be a 2×1 notched riser each side of the helix and they will be screwed to the 2×1 on which the helix is resting at the moment. Note that this first layer will be about seven inches higher that it is now. The bottom layer is around 49 inches elevation. Where it sits now gives me a solid base to construct the remaining four layers and to lay the track as I go. I am currently waiting on a shipment of PECO code 75 flex track from the UK before I can proceed any further. Flex track seemed to me to be the easiest method of laying track in the helix rather than using my handbuilt track method. The plan is to lay track on the first level, then construct the next level from the segments, lay the track on that level and so on. More on this later.

I like the idea of sloughing off all the artificial layers of stuff we accumulate, protect and worry about. I’m not just talking just about belongings – but also about intangibles like your 401(k), your social obligations, your job. After the apocalypse, who cares about your credit rating or what’s going to happen to windstorm insurance rates? And having a little extra meat on your bones could be an advantage. I have a strange attraction to the post-industrial agrarian visions like that at the end of “England, England” by Julian Barnes. This, even though I grew up in a rural area and am well aware that farming (especially without heavy machinery), animal husbandry, toting water and firewood, preserving food, making clothes, etc., is hard work. And how much harder will it be when you can’t run down to the Agway or Jo-Ann’s Fabrics for your supplies? But that’s the thing about the apocalypse. It’s not a voluntary dropping out, joining a commune, going back to the land. It’s a Big Change and if you survive it, you have to figure out how to cope.

Overspending or excessive spending can often be used as a mind-altering ‘drug.’ As you notice, there are certain feelings that prompt you to overspend. Common ones are stress, loneliness, anxiety, sadness, and boredom, to mention a few. However, don’t be surprised if you find that happiness, success, or accomplishments may prompt you to “shop ‘til you drop” as well.

Long before he changed the course of 20th-century popular music and crowned himself “The Hardest Working Man in Show Business,” little James Brown may well have been the hardest working boy in Augusta, Georgia, where he was sent to live with his Aunt Honey Washington at the age of six. He’d spent the previous several years with his father, James, Sr., who scraped out a meager living selling pine tar to the local turpentine factory in the woods of Barnwell County, South Carolina, just down the Savannah River from Augusta. James’s mother had left with another man when James was only four, and while Aunt Honey would play something of a maternal role for James, the fact that she ran a brothel and sold moonshine for a living made for anything but a traditional upbringing.

I left in exceedingly high spirits which made me uncharacteristically loquacious in philosophy class. We were discussing Peter Singer’s rather extreme view of Utilitarianism. It seemed to me unrealistic (and therefore of no real utility) and…well, reducio ad absurdum. Also, his devotion to measuring “the greater good” by suffering alone is strangely negative and yet strangely common: the imperative (found in many philosophies, religions and psychiatric offices) to eliminate suffering altogether makes one wonder if it isn’t perhaps a one sided look at life.

What about least favorites? What did I hate? I'm going to excuse really dumb things like Sleepaway Camp 3: Teenage Wasteland, because that's too easy. I really disliked Funny Ha Ha and thought that the hype about it was absolutely unwarranted. I also didn't like The Departed, though I figure I'm alone in that. The Wicker Man was fucking AWFUL, probably the worst film I saw this year, but it was so damn funny, I have to give it points for unintentional hilarity. How about Smokin' Aces? That movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities, not even Jason Bateman in a bra.

Gadhafi ran Libya's government as a stridently anti-Western dictatorship. British and American military bases were closed in 1970; in the same year the property of Libya's Italian and Jewish communities was confiscated. The ancient Qur'anic law of cutting off the hands of thieves was reinstituted, gambling and alcoholic beverages were outlawed, and all foreign petroleum assets were nationalized (1973). A fervent Arab nationalist, he sought to unify Libya with other Arab countries, including Egypt and Tunisia, while bitterly opposing Israel. Since Gadhafi took power the Libyan government has been known for its support of many international terrorist and guerrilla organizations, including the Irish Republican Army, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and other extremist Arab and Islamic groups.
Having said all that, we found it intelligent, moving, tense, rewarding... and not at all offensive as sci fi. Oh, do crank down your sf’nal dials! Some things are preposterous... while others are cleverly explained or played out. Worthwhile, including the cool ending.

According to the ANC Regime's own Human Rights Commission (HRC), 73 people died while in Police detention during the period 1963 to 1990, which equates to 2.6 people annually during the "Apartheid" years.
Answer 2: Again, an easy question. Most patriots, especially military veterans, have in mind the BoR when thinking warm fuzzy thoughts about Constitutional oaths. But you can be sure that high office holders are instead only thinking about all that power vested in their offices when they take an oath. Both groups are correct, but only one of them carries the day in any meaningful way, which brings us to…
Morning everyone.
By the way, if we ever get this to become a “household term” and people, like, refer to their favorite directors and, hell, even themselves as “screwball existentialists” that’d be fine by me, because I know lots of people whose personal philosophies I’d say fit the bill (I may even go so far as to say those are my favorite “kinds” of people), and, yeah, I’d like to think I more often than not fall darn nicely into that category along with them. I got a monumentally good Reuben sandwich today from a deli in a dying strip mall.
Adelyn loved crawling all over the animals in the "crawlers" play area and then I had her crawl up to the top of the "big kids" play area a few times so that we could go down the fast slides - which she absolutely loved!
That, in a nutshell, is how I have grown to feel about many of the recipes in Baking. Really minimal effort can sometimes yield incredible returns - chief among them the feeling that you can accomplish something amazing in your own little kitchen.
If that is true, then the work is sure to drag, and become truly, drudgery. “No inspiration in it!” Then the artist has none, for we housewives can draw living pictures; then the poet has none, for we can produce heavenly harmonies; then the statesman has none, for our home can be a little realm and we it’s ruler and lawgiver; then the preacher has none, for it is possible to preach hourly, silent sermons. “No inspiration!” When you sweep a room can you not think how God sweeps the world with His wind? When lighting a fire, of the fire on His altar? When washing, of His cleansing? When cooking, of God’s bread? When nursing of Gods everlasting arms? When dusting, of the spotless life? “No inspiration!” When heaven is likened to a home which the Lord is getting ready

My wife died in 2007 after a long illness. A month or so later I realised how alone I was between being an Innkeeper and her illness. On an idle Sunday morning, 10th June 2007, I joined an internet dating club. This required recording a host of personal details, likes and dislikes. One of which was that I smoked a pipe. When the registering process was complete, the system popped up a message that it had found a 100% match for me. Intrigued, I looked at her profile and found that she lived in the same town. Not one to hang around, I wrote her a letter via the dating club. After fudging my profile to remove the pipe smoking thing. Because she had set non-smoking as a prerequisite.
The way I figured it, even though the hours were long, and the commitment would prevent me from pursuing real acting gigs, it was wise to put things on hold for a few months and just concentrate on setting aside some money. As long as they were willing to work around the corporate picnics that I had already scheduled for the season, which this guy said they were, it would be a great chance to make some cash while becoming a better stilt performer.

So now all that's left is a great break-up fuck. Unless that fuck involves us staying the year longer, in which case I'm not sure I feel horny at all. Nuh huh.
So I didn't apply to further education, I was too busy just staying alive. In fact I passed them all, comfortably, including an extra one thrown in by my headmaster, for which I had not studied at all. That's a story in itself.
Scoop the batter into the muffin tins, and bake for 25-30 minutes. This is a very approximate time. I’ve only made this recipe once, but believe me, it’s good.

6. Here is our sixth and final step. Saturday morning when you start to lay out the days plans, "I'm going to start cleaning out closets in here while you start weeding that flower bed right there..." be prepared for some opposition. And when it comes at you, and it will, you can make it all go away with this one little sentence: "That's fine, if you don't want to do it, I get it! But just keep the kids out of my way while I work, okay? Keep them with you."

But Reps. Issa and McHenry conveyed a different message in their latest letter to DeMarco, saying FHFA “occupies a unique position in our system of government in which its independence rests upon the need for technical expertise free from coercive influences.”
So, I cut 3 panels, the front, the side and one for the corner to give it some room and so we could easily access what is stored under it.
“Yep, especially if we don’t tell THEM. The girls will make ‘em show up, especially if I throw in a steak or any other kind of supper.” A supper nice restaurant here called “Jakes” was the destination, so they had us a nice place for 10 prepared right on time.

Boil the linguine in salted water and add a few drops of oil to prevent sticking. Cook 1 minute short of al dente, remove from heat and drain (pasta should still be quite firm) and keep warm, save 1-2 cups of pasta water.

Divide the dough evenly into thirds, and put each portion in the center of a baking sheet. Shape the dough with slightly wet hands into logs about 2-inches wide and 15 inches long. Bake until set and brown around the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool logs on the baking sheets for about 10 minutes.

Our young people must be trained first to know themselves. We must come to terms with reality always. I am an Idoma, I am a Nigerian. I have to come to terms with this. I will die Idoma, I will die a Nigerian. Once you come to terms with that, then you are going to respect your essence. You are going to respect your people; you are going to respect yourself. And until you know yourself, until you understand this, we all have a long way to go.

What a glorious day here in Essex, the sun is shining and it's even warm too. Time to be outside really and not tucked away indoors. However I have lots of cards to make and little time to do some in, so I really need to get stuck in whilst waiting for Mr Tesco to arrive.

To make a long story short (too late) we spent the majority of our Tuesday evening ironing purple candle wax off the bedroom carpet with paper bags.

So many options here! I'm not usually one for bracelets (I type and sew a lot and don't like things banging against my work surface) but I LOVE a cute pair of earrings or a necklace and I will pin a brooch to just about anything. Again, this is a good place to inject a little creativity or whimsy into your outfit.
Dimpled glass. Smells malty and has the thin musty piney hop smell of maybe Sterling, like the 2 Deg Below. Strong poofy head, darker amber color. Oh yeah. It tastes like their Pale Ale with that strong malt up front, but with a Sterling hoppish thing in the middle, but a Cascade hop aftertaste. I imagine they put the Cascade early in the boil b/c you can't smell it, but put this other hop just before fermenting or even dry hopping. The maltiness is not as existent the more I drink it, and I'm left with this Cascade aftertaste that ain't goin nowhere, as in it's 5 minutes later and I'm still tasting hops

Re-evaluate your career. When you’re single, it’s more important than ever to find satisfaction in your work. If you’re not happy with your job, attempt to find a more fulfilling one. If that’s not possible, look for other ways to find fulfillment, such as going back to school or volunteering. Find causes you’re passionate about. Keep physically active. Think of everything you do as geared to feeling good about yourself and building and maintaining connections with other people.
On this week’s Project Runway, the designers and robo-Joanna took a little field trip to the United Nations, where Joanna tasked the alleged all-stars with creating a look based on world flags. Did anyone else find this challenge odd? I mean, I’m fairly certain these designers cannot identify most world countries on a map. And, more to the point, it seemed like a fairly lame source of inspiration.
Govea was committed to the Division of Juvenile Justice from Kings County Juvenile Court with a conviction for first-degree burglary.
Why it’s trouble: I have witnessed more fights between mothers over competing child raising ideologies than I proud to admit. Most diehard adherents have convinced themselves that the other side has embarked on a course of child-abuse, and must be set right at the first, and every subsequent opportunity. This would include saving an unsuspecting Mother-to-be from the terrible curse that your evil proselytizing tome will bring. And when the fight starts, all the other guests will probably be more interested in keeping the peace then defending your free speech. Leave these sore points on the shelf.
So don’t wait until you’re old to put your selfish ways to death and start living in freedom. Here’s how you can die young to live for Jesus now:
Statistical knowledge once was rare. It was a property of the minds of great rulers, conquerors, and generals, people who succeeded or failed by the manipulation of large quantities that remained, to them, unimagined because unimaginable: merely accountable quantities of land, treasure, people, soldiers, and workers. This is the sort of knowledge we now call “data” or “facts” or “information.” Or we call it “objective knowledge,” supposedly untainted by personal attachment, but nonetheless available for industrial and commercial exploitation. By means of such knowledge a category assumes dominion over its parts or members. With the coming of industrialism, the great industrialists, like kings and conquerors, become exploiters of statistical knowledge. And finally virtually all of us, in order to participate and survive in their system, have had to agree to their substitution of statistical knowledge for personal knowledge. Virtually all of us now share with the most powerful industrialists their remoteness from actual experience of the actual world. Like them, we participate in an absentee economy, which makes us effectively absent even from our own dwelling places. Though most of us have little wealth and perhaps no power, we consumer–citizens are more like James B. Duke than we are like my grandfather. By economic proxies thoughtlessly given, by thoughtless consumption of goods ignorantly purchased, now we all are boomers.

More cheese? We toss up between the Buffalo burger and the buffalo ricotta gnocchi, but the gnocchi wins out. It's a plate of cheesiness, with a generous amount of parmesan adding oomph to the light pillows of ricotta.
I cannot tune out this teenage girl as she recites “Invictus” over and over. She recites it perfectly until she reaches the fourth stanza where chokes on a sob as she tries her hardest to get out the last two lines. She closes her eyes as tears stream down her face while she does her best to remember. However, her mind keeps coming up blank. So she starts over, but she never finishes. It just goes on and on without her ever uttering those lines, but I hear her heart murmurs the word ‘invincible’ every single time she hits that point between ending and starting. I hope she hears it as much as I do.

When my husband informed me he felt we should sell our house and move an hour away to a new community where his brother was senior pastor of a church, I was hesitant about leaving my happy life for a town with schools that had a less than stellar reputation, high unemployment, and fewer amenities than we were accustomed. Although the lower cost of living was attractive, I knew that moving there would mean my husband would have to commute 55 minutes each way to work each day. To offset the price of gas we would be paying each month, we had to buy a smaller, less expensive home.
Jesus came to live among us to change that sad story, to open possibilities which once seemed closed. We hear how Jesus appeared among his disciples while the two from the road to Emmaus encounter were telling their incredible story – “Jesus is alive! We’ve seen him. We knew him in the breaking of the bread.” Suddenly there among them stood Jesus himself.
Pilsner Urquell is one of my favorite brews. I may have to work out something different though. This recipe calls for five and a half ounces of hops. At today's prices, this brew is $50 for a 5 gallon batch. Still, if it comes out right, it will be worth it.
Last Christmas I gave my husband a coupon book for various outings. One was a walk through the Oak Bay Marina followed by hot chocolate at the coffee shop. A couple of weeks ago, that's what we did on a Sunday afternoon. But the boats were too enthralling - the coffee shop closed before we had our hot chocolate. So of course, we had to go again!

That’s true if you count supporters and donors, but the AY opposition wouldn’t be the same without a full-time activist with press, graphic design, and webmastering skills—and who could serve as an eminent domain plaintiff.
But things may not be going according to the government’s script. After a hesitant start, BNP has so far been pretty deft on the issue. Contrary to what the AL-ers must have been hoping for, the reaction to the arrest of Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury was not a nationwide hartal or street agitation. Instead, BNP chief has come out and said her party would support a genuine trial. Since the government has ruled out trying Pakistanis, BNP can use it as an opening: we will see your trial, and raise you a trial of ‘real war criminals’. Meanwhile, BNP has also taken a hard-line approach with Jamaat in the local government elections.

Spoilt for choice is an understatement. My eyes darted from pumpclip to pumpclip, left, right, left, right and back again struggling to take in the beery options available in front of me. Like a glutton in a pie shop, I just couldn't make my mind up what I wanted first but that's a happy problem to have and it's probably one that most visitors to Craft experience. I wasn't complaining as the selection in front of me was truly exceptional.

I began to read everything I could get my hands on. I read books on the occult, tomes by Carlos Castanada, Blavatsky, Euspensky and others who introduced me to the New Age paradigm. I continued to experiment with drugs, looking to be enlightened by them. I went on vision quests and very often when taking psychedelics I had horrible experiences. I realize now that all of these drugs were gateways into the occult, stepping-stones to the world of the Fallen One and his dark purposes.
Because I seemed to have more to say this week than last, I couldn't fit my "Weekly Overview" onto one card, so I split it in half and put it on two cards. A look at the first half pretty much sums up the left side of the page, except I didn't mention that amazing full rainbow I caught over our house after dropping Dean off at school Wednesday morning. The photo is probably self-explanatory though.

And, what picnic would be complete without a Picnic Platemat Tote for your kids to carry?! It doubles as both a tote for your kids to carry their plate, utensils, and napkins, and a placemat for them to eat on. It means less for you to pack and carry, and your kids will love packing and carrying their own personalized tote. If it gets dirty (not that that would ever happen with my kids...), no worries - it's machine washable and your kids will love using it over and over again.
The last dish I will review here is 'Birthday Girl's entree - Kurobuta Pork medalions ($34) with whipped apple mousseline, confit fennel, roasted spaghetti squash, cider reduction, and watercress salad. Pork is always a challenge to get just right - it has to be thoroughly cooked for health reasons, but if you cook it even for just a little too long, it will become dry and tough. Olives did a great job with getting it just right with this dish. The apple/cider flavors are good complements, while the roasted spaghetti squash is an interesting side texture and flavor-wise (it was actually the first time I had spaghetti squash)! However, while a solid hitter, this one did not knock us out of the park - and certainly was not in our minds a $34 value!

So I made the call, gripping the phone to my mouth like a diver trapped in a cave without air grabbing someone else’s regulator, trying to tap their oxygen. While the phone was ringing, on the other end, fifteen-hundred miles and one time zone away. I tried to control my breathing, so I wouldn’t get the bends, then she answered and my heart accelerated; I could feel myself rocketing with adrenaline. She said, “Hello?” In my head I stared at the sky as I plummeted back-first into an endless abyss. I said nothing. She hung up immediately. I pushed down the hook, distancing myself, embarrassed and trying to protect myself, suddenly. I let the button up. The hum of the disconnected line sizzled in my ear like an angry tuning fork that had been smacked against my funny bone. The room seemed filled with an accosting hum in the dim light. I put down the phone and held my forehead in my hands. She was sure to know it had been me.
Back when I was in the Philippines, I’d often speak Taglish, which is a mix of English and Tagalog. I have to make an effort to speak in straight English. I can’t even speak in straight Tagalog. It always has to be mixed. I’m not like weird or anything because almost all Filipinos speak this way.

My first Sunday, a gentleman who recognized me from my workplace came and asked if he could sit next to me. I agreed. In the awkward “get-to-know” you greeting time, he asked basic questions which ended with me having to explain that the situation is a little awkward at best, and I am separated and getting divorced. I had emailed the pastor prior to coming, to try to explain my delicate situation, and to know in advance their take on divorce. The week earlier I had gone to an Anglican church, only to learn from a friend that they told her to return to her husband. Even though I received no reply, and don’t know for sure if the email address was even valid, I worked up the courage to go just the same. So I asked this gentleman, if he didn’t mind, how this church felt about divorce. To which he said that he was divorced, and he was still there.
