A THOUGHT FROM PASTOR RICH – Joshua 9:14-27; James 1:5-8; 4:13-15 God has revealed His word and His will to us in the Bible. God wants us to know Him, love Him and obey Him – Jn 14:15, 21, 23; 17:3. In Joshua 9, the Israelites failed because they did not seek God’s counsel, His will. They made their own decisions based on their own wisdom. This resulted in many problems. Do you seek God’s will? God’s wisdom? Do you want to know God’s will to consider it or to do it? God always gives His

You all might be thinking I'm lazy. It is simply not true. I have been lying on a beach in the South of Spain for the last two weeks, without internet access. You know if I had any way of getting to the internet that I'd be sitting in a dark room writing this utter drivel for ya'all.

Well of course it wasn't!! Those people who are not shouldering the blame make way too much money for them to take the blame for anything. Rich people do not make misteaks......see, I made one right there so's you will not think that I am rich. Every time the economy goes into the tank, the fat cats look around for somebody to blame and always, it's me.

Praise is lovely. It's one of many social tools we use to form connections with others. If we absolutely 100% didn't care about what others thought, we would go to work in our comfy pajamas and fart in restaurants.
This was a case where the Sam Adams etched bottom glass may have not been the best choice. As Global Killer and his little buddies angrily churned away, I noticed brown streaks on the foamy head. For this I paid $5.49? To have skid marks on my beer foam? Sikke noget pis!
I visited with my mom and dad over the Christmas holidays and I got to see some snow. We haven't had much in T.O. so it was nice to see everything covered in white. While I visited with them, I got to draw new images. One afternoon, as I was lying on my childhood bed and trying to come up with some new images; I noticed my old bear sitting on a shelf. I liked that little bear, but did not play much with him because I was never really interested in dolls and teddy bears while growing up (cars and trucks interested me more, lol!). So, I decided to make a series of images with teddy bears of all sorts. For this project, I decided to use Winter Bear who is all wrapped up for a cold winter day... perfect for this challenge.
Years ago, I came across a delicious and important morsel from a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to Reverend Jared Sparks in 1820. It shaped important aspects of "In God Is Our Trust," and in truth, it shaped much of my Free Men and Dreamers series. For years, as I would hear sides argue over whether the Founders were Christian, drawing particularly upon Jefferson's seeming distance from the Christian churches of his day, I would take comfort in this and a few other quotes, knowing that they provided intimate glimpses into his true religious sentiments.

Noonan described “the brutalization of their corpses” as “savage, primitive, unacceptable” and decried that the “terrible glee of the young men in the crowds, and the sadism they evinced, reminds us of the special power of the ignorant to impede the good.” She wrote that the Iraqis responsible for such gruesome actions “take pleasure in evil, and they were not shy to show it. They are arrogant. They think barbarity is their right.”

Guy Hasson - The Levantine Experiments ***: Evil scientists with undefined goals keep children isolated in featureless white rooms. One day one of the girls in the experiment notices a crack in the wall of her chamber, which both terrifies and fascinates her. Conceptually this is an interesting story, but the execution is flawed. The little girl is strangely uncurious before the crack appears -- supplies are delivered to her room while she sleeps, but she's never tried to find out where they come from. She doesn't even seem to've created a story to explain it. Why would a crack in the wall inspire her imagination, but not the rolls of toilet-paper?

Bait and switch. This is a really common marketing scheme, not only for agencies but a lot of businesses, too. At first, they offer you a really exciting position in an awesome location — like Hawaii or California — that they know you would love. After sending in your application, they call to let you know the position has been filled, BUT they have a really great position available in North Dakota (no offense to N. Dakota). Heard this before? Yep, red flag.

I also adore the fact that instead of being just two colors it introduces greens and yellows too. This will help keep the orange from becoming overwhelming and it is something interesting for baby to look at as he or she gets a little older. Perhaps buy you a few minutes of extra sleep after the little one wakes up!!

I have read the study on the use of opera and classical music to remove vagrants from business districts. I agree it was worth a try. I also understand business owners have a right to their opinion, even if that opinion disagrees with PDIDA. Without business owners there would be no PDIDA. Frankly, downtown Pottstown is in the worst shape I have ever seen it; since moving here in 1983. Antagonizing and bad-mouthing Dave Walsh is spitting in the face of one of the few reasons to even go downtown.
The seventh and final SmartIT Initiative is the selection of a suitable IT management support team, who can work alongside the CIO in the quest for improving business outcomes. The choices available are wide, with boutique consultancies and big powerhouse consulting brands. An ideal team would be one with a combination of ground-level operations experience; specialist expertise in relevant areas; provider and user side experience; delivery track record in diverse sectors and cultures; and geographically located for ease of intervention. Obviously the team needs to be a trusted third-party completely aligned to CIOs goals, but a real advantage would be if it were dispersed and available locally in user and provider locations, allowing regular management support and interventions, to implement initiatives beyond providing independent assessments and advice.

Meditation: Do you know the joy of the resurrection? The Risen Jesus revealed the glory of his resurrection to his disciples gradually and over a period of time. Even after the apostles saw the empty tomb and heard the reports of Jesus’ appearance to the women, they were still weak in faith and fearful of being arrested by the Jewish authorities. When Jesus appeared to them he offered proofs of his resurrection by showing them the wounds of his passion, his pierced hands and side. He calmed their fears and brought them peace, the peace which reconciles sinners and makes one a friend of God. Jesus did something which only love and trust can do. He commissioned his weak and timid apostles to carry the gospel to the ends of the earth. This sending out of the disciples is parallel to the sending out of Jesus by his Father. Jesus fulfilled his mission through his perfect love and perfect obedience to the will of his Father. He called his disciples, and he calls us to do the same. Just as he gave his first disciples the gift of the Holy Spirit, so he breathes on each of us the same Holy Spirit who equips us with new life, power, joy, and courage to live each day as followers of the Risen Lord.
Two other decisions, however, were of questionable merit: Isabella Fiore, in which the Board applied the doctrine of foreign equivalents in a Section 2(e)(4) context without any analysis of the purpose of the surname refusal; and Vignette, wherein the Board seemed to encourage discovery gamesmanship by allowing a party to delay the revelation of information until disclosure was convenient.

Unfortunately, the men reached the second floor before I could find a gun, and so I climbed to the roof to escape; and outside my grandfather’s yard I saw my dad doing yard work & I saw a fictional dog that I somehow knew, and so I yelled for my dad to get into my grandfather’s truck because some men with guns were trying to kill me.
In words, in song lyrics in sharing our “pieces of ourselves,” we find a freedom that cannot be found merely with another’s permission. I remember reading many years ago, a work by Erica Jong. I can’t recall whether it was story form or an accounting of her life. But I can recall her saying that she loved her dog so much that she would lick the pee off the floor for it. Or something like that. At the time I thought, what a nutty woman. I thought she was smarter than that. I see now she was merely trying to make a point.
BraufactuM Darkon is described as an "elegant Schwarzbier" at 5.4% ABV. It has a light roast and toffee aroma, with some fruitiness. The initial impression on the flavour is that of a thin malt drink with a pleasant raisin fruitiness with light coffee and chocolate notes. Remarkably floral at the back, it delivers a pronounced herbal bitterness, washed away by thin caramel flavours. It's nice that this bitterness gives a sharp contrast to the sweet and roast flavours, but it ends on a bit of a bilious sour note. Better when drinking, and not good to stop so. Interesting, but not a balance of flavours that works for me. Well, not the sick.

There were some great characters in this book. Anna was awesome, and I found it really strange that I was rooting for a mass murderer. But it was all about the way she was written. She was flawed, but she was real. The story behind her murder really got to me. That scene was incredibly intense by the way. I was upset. I have this thing about realistic violence. I don't like to read about it, I don't watch movies with it in it, and if I had known about it beforehand, I would have prepared myself. But I got through it.

YEAST COLLECTING VESSEL - Meantime a most primitive system prevails as regards collecting, and storing pitching yeast, old casks employed for same and unboiled pit water being the only water used for cleaning these casks. Messrs Adams have fitted a rail below fermenting vessels with the idea of running aluminium yeast tanks under parachute tubes to collect yeast from same, but meantime there is only the rail. This system, if properly carried out would be an admirable one, but fairly costly. Meantime I would suggest getting three copper lined yeast waggons on wheels with portable cold water attemperators, such as your Brewer has seen at work in Duddingston Brewery, for storing his pitching yeast.'

This article appeared in the week my youngest daughter started infant school. I’d been looking forward to it immensely, because I’d spent the last three years working from home and looking after two young children. Working from home meant I didn’t have the social aspects of life that working in an office could bring and being a single parent of two young children meant that nights out were rare. I’d suffered depression of varying degrees, particularly since the birth of my second daughter, and had been happy to stay at home with my girls. But I saw my youngest daughter starting school as an opportunity to meet some new people, make some new friends and the start of a new chapter in my life.
But guess what, that particular weekend which I had had 'plan' to get my passport settled pretty much fucked up. What made me really pissed was having to get up so early on a weekend - which is so not me to go for a taxi ride (home - Immigration - home) for nothing but being told that their system was currently down for some sort of upgrading! Yeah right.

But if you had the feeling that the logistics department at the brewery struggled with the mechanics of sending those cases across Bass Strait, it was nothing compared to the troubles connected with serving the next beer. Wizard Smith Ale is a cracking interpretation of a flavoursome English style ale named for a loyal Boag’s employee who saved the company draught horse fleet from rising flood waters and received for his efforts a lifetime tenure at the brewery. Again, it is a beer which struggled to find mainstream acceptance and was consigned to the beery scrap heap of history until the locals revolted and the company relented. Like the XXX Ale, it is now available in Launceston only and here is where the trouble begins.
In the interview I did with the CBC we talked about my High School reunion. One of the things I tried to explain was my need to establish and maintain links to my past.

I watched Midnight In Paris last night. This is about Americans in Paris and therefore it's full of similarly mangled versions of well-known foreign words. Parisians becomes "Pareezhuns". The painter Monet is "Moanay". The sculptor Rodin is "Row-Dan". When the Sorbonne is first mentioned it's "Sorebone". The Boeuf Bourguignon is "Boeuf Berniown". The splendid old Peugeot which picks Owen Wilson up every night is a "Poojoe". This is not exclusively a problem with French words either. The well-known flat bread popular in Greece is "Peter Bread".

One symptom of her discomfort is an almost Tourette's-like compulsion to pull at her face – tugging at her cheeks, wiping her nose and almost-picking with little digs on the rim of the nostril.

It goes on to briefly address the effects, “EMP is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences. EMP will cover the wide geographic region within line of sight to the nuclear weapon. It has the capability to produce significant damage to critical infrastructures and thus to the very fabric of US society...” The Commission's chairman has testified that within one year of such an attack, 70% - 90% of Americans would be dead from such causes as disease and violence. It is also highly plausible that many Americans would die of starvation due to the interruption of the national food supply.

The distress call of a buffalo is magnet for the predators, and any predators within ear-shot of the call could not be far. I had had a feeling that there were lions close by the whole time, even before the calf started calling, and kept checking to the south – the direction the herd had come from – to see if there were any lions moving upon the herd. When the calf started its calling, I thought if it’s not the lions that arrive, then either Nkateko or the Rockfig hyena clan would be there within minutes.

The play itself is the tale of Ma Lu's (Zhang Nianhua) hopeless passion for Mingming (Qi Xi), who is herself in love with an abusive man who won't love her back. Ma Lu is a zookeeper, and his only confidant is a lone rhinoceros, to whom he addresses his confessional monologues. This dodgy love story is punctuated by satirical clowning scenes, in which the reckless individualism represented by Ma Lu and Mingming is counterpointed by the conventions of the state or market. There is, for example, a series of "Love Tutorials", in which young people are taught the proper expressions for love through Hollywood cliches and pop songs.

I volunteer in children’s ministry and lead their worship team. One of the team members felt that certain rules should not apply to him when he didn’t like them. So, he told his mother lies about me . . . and she decided to “confront” me after service one Sunday. I calmly explained the situation to her and was completely in the right (Our pastor even confirmed it.). But, one of my overseers also advised me to “pour oil” on the situation. In other words: apologize to the mother if I had offended her in any way and ask for forgiveness for any offence. After some prayer, I realized it was only my pride that was holding me back. And pride is just an elevated opinion of yourself — it has nothing to do with Jesus or honoring Him. Regardless of what others may do, when I stand before God, I am responsible for my heart alone.

Now there's no good reason to delay, and given how much I LOVE my nephew and feel this maternal need to protect him as if he were my own, I think I've made all the babysteps toward progress possible. Still... be prepared to read a year from now, that we've decided to wait. Again. And then my mother in law and mom will heave weepy sighs, and cross their arms in disappointment. I say I want to now, but when the time comes I fear cold feet will strike again. Thank you, Chuck.

A fairly small but welcoming shop front is neat and tidy without being fussy or poofy and the fully stocked and properly labelled shelves and displays are signs that someone cares about what they are doing rather than a sign that the staff have too much free time. The lack of space is no hindrance if you have the place to yourself but they have very good back up plan in case the shop is full. A very ‘user friendly’ website and weblog are a terrific tool for working out your shopping list and a bit of virtual browsing is a great way to work out the cost of your trip as well.

The music grew louder, more insistent, opposing other sound from reaching her ears. Every vibration of the melody shredded into her body unravelling her being. Althea cried out as the notes of the song coursed through her nerves and pain sang its way through her body to consume the essence of her inner self. She screamed, defiant, as she felt hands touch her, pull at her, the family’s voices mingling with the sound of the music...

To bring this fantasy complex into being, DOT, with the help of Swiss firm BIG InvestConsult AG, turned to local shipyard Drydocks World, which will be tasked with constructing the futuristic disc-shaped hotel. The underwater portion, with about 11,000 square feet (1,000 square meters) of usable area, will house 21 two-guest rooms, and sit about 33 feet (10 m) below the waves. Plans also call for a diving center complete with decompression chamber and air locks, a spa, a spacious garden, open terraces above the waterline, and even a helipad atop one of the surface discs for guests who wish to arrive by air.

I also tried a new technique by coloring the stems of the flowers with Lindy Stamp Gang Dark Chocolate Truffle Stain. The stems come in green but for this layout I wanted to color all the stems a deep chocolate brown to match the layout more.

My arm surgery went well, two stitches only. A bit of bruisy feeling this a.m., but nothing major. I think it'll hurt more to take off the bandage. The small spot on my face? He cryo'd it but I have to say there really is no change to it other than a wee bit of swelling. I don't think it worked. But whatever. Still facing foot surgery for removal of a ganglion cyst on my toe. Most people wouldn't notice it (about the size of a BB), but it bothers me.
Very short story but still an enjoyable read.
But the women seemed to dislike the beer, especially the young girls. Usually before drinking a young man would hand his cup to one of the maids, who barely touched it with her lips, and, making a grimace, turned away her face. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the ways of woman to say with certainty if this proved that at other times they were so abstemious.
In 2005 I mustered the courage to leave my marriage and moved to a fresh start in beautiful, light-filled Colorado with my three children and with the help and blessing of my soon-to-be ex. He immediately changed his tune and continued abusing me, now using the court system as a weapon through a horrendous custody battle. He lied about me and about himself to two psychologists and in courtroom after courtroom. I told the truth and was abused. The court sided with the liar and took my children from me, giving them to a man who never spent time with them and barely parented them, unless I agreed to move back to Pennsylvania and take on joint custody. I was devastated. I could not leave my babies. Moving back to Pennsylvania felt like giving up a dream of a better life, but I did it for my children. I had no other choice. My kids were devastated too at being made to leave their home, their friends, and their new life.
When I was revising the manuscript, I did 97% of what my editor asked me to do. But there was one thing I didn't do. The main character, Isabel, gets to compete in a baking contest, and toward the end of the book, travels to New York City for the contest. My editor suggested maybe I should tell the readers the results of the baking contest. It wasn't a command so much as a suggestion. And I decided I liked leaving it open-ended.

After wrapping up dinner, we came home and went to bed around 10:30pm. At 11:30 I woke up to contractions that began at 3 minutes apart. I laid there for a few minutes to see if it was like the false labor contractions I had a few days before. The contractions stayed steady for over an hour and got even stronger. I made the call to the on-call Dr. and let her know I was coming in. Naturally the Dr on call was the only one in the practice I had never seen.

I hope you enjoyed these highlights from the I Teach K! National Kindergarten Conference! I also hope that they bring me back to present there next year, but there are no guarantees, even though my sessions were full to bursting with participants! Last year, I was not invited even though my sessions always went well in the past. If you have plans to attend next year and would like to see me present, I would love it if you would email SDE and let them know that you would like them to bring me back again. They DO keep track of and listen to these requests. It is going to be in Las Vegas again at the Venetian/Palazzo Hotels, on July 9-12, 2012. Thanks, I appreciate it!

It's preseason for the NFL, and it's Monday Night Football. This means two things: 1. I'm going to be drinking. 2. I'm going to be watching football. Even though preseason typically sucks the penis of a rambunctious porcupine, being without any NFL news all summer has made this preseason so much more enjoyable. So, I'm going to drink, watch the game, and rant about whatever comes to mind. Enjoy. Or play a rousing game of Hide the Pickle with your creepy neighbor.

Here’s what I’m thinking: participants would select a course out of the usual suspects (beverages, appetizers, salads, soup/stews, sides, main course, breads, desserts – any I’m forgetting?) and on the date selected, they would publish a post of their recipe with photos. A “button” would guide readers to the preceding post and the following post. A blog circle. The circle would be set up so that it starts with the appetizers and moves through the courses. Perhaps there would also be a “host” site that is not participating in the potluck, but just serves as a launching point for the event. A bit of HTML here and there (provided by me and inserted by you into your post) would tie us all together.

As I said at the start, expectation is a terrible thing. A part of me was disappointed by much of what I read here but not all. The problem lies with me, though. I am not the boy I was when I first read Ivan Denisovich so why should I expect the author of these stories to be the same man that wrote that book? In some respects that’s what part of the problem here is, a dwelling too much on the past, but again not entirely. Also one has to consider who Solzhenitsyn was writing for and to, not the West, but his fellow Russians. In other writings of this time, e.g. The Russian Question at the End of the Twentieth Century and Russia in Collapse, he did address contemporary issues but there’s not so much of that here. If anything (and these are words other reviewers have used) these are somewhat nostalgic, moralistic stories.

But even with no natural light and a crappy photo, this was worth blogging and when spring rolls around I'll update the post with a picture more worthy of this recipe. It's easy. Stupidly easy. It's so tasty. It will easily become a weekly meal for us. Much thanks to Mama G over at Growing Up Geeky for pointing me in the recipe's direction! I took that one and jazzed it up a bit, like the other Buffalo Chicken Wraps I've made in the past. But these ones are a bit healthier as there is no breading and it's not fried.

At the moment we are focusing on providing miniature flowers made from genuine mulberry paper for crafts use - although we have a small selection of non -paper crafts too. Why mulberry paper? Because they are robust, realistic look and last longer than ordinary paper and it provide a sustainable income for people in the cottage industry. In due course we will be introducing more of other craft materials which is not related to mulberry paper.

As often happens when I paint, I started to think about the people who'd lived here before us; the couples and families, growing up and growing old; all the things that might have happened. It was probably around eighty years ago that this house was painted for the very first time. I can imagine the excitement of the young couple who moved into their newly built home, who looked out of the windows at the long muddy strip of land that would one day become a garden. I picture them standing in the doorway of the second bedroom, choosing colours for the nursery. I wonder how many different colours the lounge and kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom have had since then, how many layers of paint have coated the walls. I like the thought that others before me have ended up with paint in their hair, on their elbows, under their fingernails.

Heat up a nonstick pan, add a little oil. When hot, add in cut shrimps, fry until almost cooked. Push to one side of the pan. Add in starch mixture on the shrimps side.

3 km to the finish line now. I’d entered the F1 track again. Surprisingly, with the limited reserve in me, I was able to overtake another runner and our distance grew with each stride. There was only one more runner ahead, separating me and the finish line. I’d hoped that he would not be the 50th runner to complete the marathon. You see, the organizer had promised a special T-shirt for the first 50 full-marathon finishers. From the beginning, I knew that it would be almost impossible to achieve that kind of ranking, but...oh well, I can be overambitious at times.

“Phenomenology,” the study of the qualities of experience, has a long history in both Eastern and Western philosophy. In its modern European version phenomenology has two post-Enlightenment roots. First, in its claim that experience has its own structure that can (and must) be explicated in order to establish the foundations of epistemology, the phenomenology of Husserl and Heidegger is thoroughly Kantian (by way of 19th century German transcendental idealism), as are the subsequent “Continental” movements of structuralism, deconstructionism etc. (Merleau-Ponty, with his emphasis on the role of the whole body in defining the phenomenal field, is an exceptional character in this community, and I will have something to say about Sartre in the discussion of Buddhism below.) Second, modern phenomenology is a response to the dramatic development of modern science and particularly to the perceived threat posed to humanism by the potential triumph of empiricism and the resulting absorption of the study of human nature into physical science.

But, things are changing this time. The lessons of the past have finally caught up with the military leadership. The most obvious evidence of this is the change in pilot training. For decades, pilots got little air time. This reduced the wear and tear on the aircraft, making it cheaper to maintain a large number of warplanes. What this produced was a large number of ill-trained pilots flying second rate aircraft. Such a force was cut to pieces by a better trained foe. That happened time and again from 1941 on. So the Chinese are now trying the other approach. The PLA pilots are now officially required to fly over a hundred hours per year. But such is the enthusiasm for developing competent pilots that most squadrons scrounge up the money to fly their pilots more than the new minimum. Front line units (on the Taiwan straits) get even more and some have pilots in the air for over 200 hours a year. This is more than Taiwanese pilots fly, and explains why the Taiwanese are so eager to upgrade their air defenses. Yet at the same time, some squadrons do not fly all that much, and the reason is usually that senior officers have stolen the money allocated for all that flying.

The larger specimens go into the catch basket, with smaller ones again returned to the loch, but not before a single claw is removed. Crabs can, it seems regrow lost claws up in a couple of months, up to three or four times, and crab claws are commercially more popular than whole crab. Indeed abroad it is common practice to break off both claws and abandon the rest of the crab to die as it needs at least one claw to effectively feed itself.

Journal of the Neurological Sciences – Volume 265, Issue 1 , Pages 78-83, 15 February 2008 – Our results seem to demonstrate that MSCs represent a good chance for stem cell cell-based therapy in ALS and that intraspinal injection of MSCs is safe also in the long term. A new phase 1 study is carried out to verify these data in a larger number of patients.

From India, the diamond went to Persia with Nadir Shah (who, by the way, was ultimately assassinated – another violent end). From Persia, the diamond ended up in Afghanistan, and from Afghanistan it returned to India.

I told them after what I’d been through in the past year, that there were several times I’d have had good reason to kill Rob but hadn’t and that I just couldn’t believe they were doing this. The agent had clearly told me I’d receive my money within 2-3 weeks, I decided to call him to confirm. He was out of town on vacation! I was just livid! The one time I really needed him in 20 years of doing business with him and he was on vacation!!! I asked who was standing in for him, got someone I’d never spoken to who wasn’t at all familiar with my case and finally I just told them to have my agent call me.
Anyways, I had one of the best 'cool feelings' the other day and it was just perfect timing to pick me up.

I finished putting up the Christmas decorations last night and found myself a little sad. My kids are grown now and no amount of ornaments or angels or twinkling lights can bring back those many joyful years of “making Christmas” for the children. But of all the things we did for them throughout the Advent season— the baking, the caroling, the viewing of insane displays of lights, the skating, the snow trips, the gathering of gifts for the homeless, the parties, the Advent calendars, the screenings of A Christmas Story, and later, Love, Actually— none was likely as important as the reminder that Kahlil Gibran gives us each day in his book The Prophet. Knowing this, believing this, is the greatest gift we’ve given Graham and Remy. May those of you with young children consider the wisdom found here….

We also got to know more about Quarles and his forced rent boy beginnings, in the great scene in the winnebago. Then got a brief but disturbing end scene with the boy he captured. It’s amusing how Wynn Duffy was a bit of a crook but now looks like the sane one compared to Quarles. Plus there was great Boyd and the election scenes (Jim Beaver there again, this time with varying levels of comfort in the bar), Raylan’s courtroom speech, Dickie being freed, and more manoeuvring from Limehouse. Oh and more amusing dialogue from Raylan’s boss – “Did that go the way you rehearsed it?”

Genre has something to do with it as well. It's perfectly fine for George R.R.

You wouldn't get away with something like that in YA.

As I sit here waiting for my photos to upload so I can show you all the new place I am living—they are taking forever to upload—I have started to think about patience. Obviously, it’s something we need in life in general. But when you’re a writer you have to be more patient that a pregnant African Elephant (they’re pregnant for an average of 660 days, in case you were wondering). Now I’m not saying that you need to wait two years on submissions, although I have actually received a couple of rejections two and even three years after I sent in a manuscript!
I really do.
For me, a huge part of the discomfort of summer comes from feeling swollen. In fact, I can't even think of l'été without remembering the dull misery of having puffy feet and "hotdog fingers." External heat dilates the blood vessels in our body, allowing increased blood flow and lymphatic fluid accumulation in our extremities. That equals swelling, edema, bloating, whatever you'd like to call it. (Personally, I call it horrible.) It doesn't feel good, nor is it good for you.
“Today has been one really tough day! The stages have been lethal in parts making controlling the car very difficult and carrying good speed near impossible, but being able to keep going and not loose unnecessary time enabled us to open up a really good margin this morning. From then on it was all about making sure we didn’t give it all away. Today is what rallying is all about and I must say a huge well done to the organisers for seeing all stages run as planned and admire their bravery for doing so despite their somewhat ‘slick’ characteristics in paces; as we found out this morning! A big thanks to all at the 586 Sport Team, EvoParts.org, Racing Lines, Trade Aways, Pamaya.com and 710 Oil for their help and support and of course to Sam on a spot on job on the notes today – it was scary enough having the pedals and a steering wheel so I don’t know what he was going through!! I just hope we can find the budget to continue as we have started the year”
Yesterday we played colour collecting. Goosey and Tiger each took turns choosing a colour and then both went on a hunt around the apartment for items of that colour, and I took a quick snap of them. I wasn't sure how it would go, but they really enjoyed it and were proud as punch with each thing they found.
The common clichés are the likes of “look on the bright side; every cloud has a silver lining; think positive.” But without Jesus Christ, that is impossible. The god of this world is a destroyer, seeking to ruin God’s creation as well as negate the power of the Almighty. For the unbeliever, there is no bright side but as Hebrews 10:27has it, “A certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.”
The law of unintended consequences provides the basis for many criticisms of government programs. As the critics see it, unintended consequences can add so much to the costs of some programs that they make the programs unwise even if they achieve their stated goals. Let us use Social Security as an example. As you may know, Social Security encompasses several social welfare and social insurance programs. Social Security was enacted by FDR in an attempt to limit what were seen as dangers in the modern American life, including old age, poverty, unemployment, and the burdens of widows and fatherless children. Since its inception, Social Security has been the epitome of what Murphy’s law entails. It has been called a Ponzi scheme but indeed it is much worse, as Reason so eloquently points out:

Yossarian strode away, cursing Catch-22 vehemently even though he knew there was no such thing. Catch-22 did not exist, he was positive of that, but it made no difference. What did matter was that everyone thought it existed, and that was much worse, for there was no object or text to ridicule or refute, to accuse, criticize, attack, amend, hate, revile, spit at, rip to shreds, trample upon, or burn up.

Sangre doesn't really strike - it's basically the same intensity, no matter how you work it - as long as you don't burn it out. It's a wonderful layering glass, in my opinion, but can almost seem like an opaque when you use it as a base by itself. It's not too stiff and doesn't spread or bleed. None of the reds seemed to bleed at all, and stayed put for the most part on all the beads, even when raked.

So I had (have?) this theory that if you don't use just one pacifier or bottle nipple the baby won't get nipple confusion because you'll teach them right away that there are different types of nipples and that you suck on each of them differently and they'll easily be able to tell what the boob nipple is and latch well on it. True? Giving newborns way too much credit? No idea, since we've had so many non-latch related issues with breastfeeding (from the start; pacifiers had nothing to do with it). Regardless, she does take four different types of pacifier with four very different nipples somewhat readily. That is, she'll take it on HER terms when SHE wants. If she doesn't want a pacifier at that point there is no way in hell you're going to get her to take it. But if she just wants to suck, she'll take it with no problem. A lot of breastfeeding resources say no pacifier, and that the baby should get all their sucking needs on mom's breast, but since she wanted to suck 24/7 and I like my nipples attached to my body, that wouldn't work for us. Girl likes to suck, and suck hard. (Please no dirty sex jokes about my newborn). We have the Natursutten orthodontic nipple, Natursutten round nipple, Gumdrop, and the hospital one, which is a lot like the GumDrop but softer. The hospital and Natursutten orthodontic are her favorites.

Besides all of these funds and supplies going to Liberia the team of 26 people had to raise $3,000 each to make this trip. The team raised all their funds(some time when I have a chance I need to share how God provided in amazing ways.) But let me share with you what the team was able to accomplish. First we set up a medical clinic and saw in just 4 days over 600 Liberian people. We held a VBS which had 400 children attend. We held a woman’s conference that had over 100 women in attendance. During our visit we set up 5 water systems plus trained those who would be providing the water. Let me say that God was incredible. And we thank and praise him for all he has done.

By mid-week, I had succumb to the wretched beast, and had made the living room chair the new centre of my universe. After I had become sick, and before Saarah had, she developed the unique ability to make me feel both better and like a complete wiener simultaneously. As I was curled up in the chair, feeling awful, Saarah came over and placed her entire teeny arm across my lower leg. After a moment, she moved her arm to a different part of my leg. On and on she went, until had “covered” all of my limbs. She told me that she was doing this to keep me warm. Once I had been sufficiently warmed by her arm, she brought me her Dora blanket, and lovingly covered me up.
”The Word of Wisdom was ‘given for a principle with promise’ (Doctrine and Covenants 89:3) … A principle is an enduring truth, a law, a rule you can adopt to guide you in making decisions. Generally principles are not spelled out in detail. Members write in asking if this thing or that is against the Word of Wisdom…We teach the principle together with the promised blessings. There are many habit-forming, addictive things that one can drink or chew or inhale or inject which injure both body and spirit which are not mentioned in the revelation…Obedience to counsel will keep you on the safe side of life.” (“The Word of Wisdom: The Principle and the Promises,” Ensign, May 1996, 17-18)

The Financial Times recently declared Sweden's Finance Minister Anders Borg as the most effective finance minister in Europe. Why? Simple really. Instead of jumping on the collective 'spend, spend, spend borrowed money' mantra bus, Mr Borg sat back, looked at history and realised that it wouldn't work. So instead, he decided to cut taxes permanently by cutting welfare spending. He also, gasp!, cut property taxes for the rich! He justified this by saying that only entrepreneurs could create wealth and if that's what he had to do to lure them back to Sweden, then that's what he'd do. And it worked. Can you imagine what the US Democrats would say to that reasoning? The result? Sweden had the fastest growth in Europe last year. Crazy hey? Who would've thought that by giving money back to people you'd create wealth? Well, Conservatives know it - that's why economies run by Conservatives usually prosper - until the liberals get back into power by promising unicorns and fairies and more welfare 'reform' and get them back into debt and more under government control. Today, most of Europe's economies are basket cases, where their governments have over-borrowed and overspent with very little of the stimulus going to the actual economy - but they're now stuck with the bill to pay off. The banks that lent the money are doing just fine though. This is money laundering and fraud on a huge scale, where tax payers get to pay back the money borrowed plus all the interest on the loan, and certain banks proper hugely. I'm no fan of Sweden for how they treated White South Africans during the 1980's, but Mr Borg - I salute you. You had the courage to go against the main-stream idiot thinking of spending for no benefit to the country. Instead, Sweden today has a vibrant economy and the rest of Europe is drowning in debt - all under their re-elected conservative coalition government. The USA and the Australian governments also used the 'spend, spend, spend' mantra to waste tax payers money on paying off their political supporters and used the global financial crisis to hide this fraud. When Obama came into power America had entered a slight recession. Today, after blowing nearly $5trillion on his 'stimulus' experiment, the country is in deep recession, with gas prices rocketing, and employment figures stagnating. Australia is no better with a debt of over $230 billion - half of what Greece owes. Isn't it wonderful having Lefties running once productive countries into the ground? Yeah, unfortunately that's exactly what the people voted for, because apparently repeating that lunacy of voting Labor-type governments will bring in different results any day now! Read the article to understand just how forward-thinking this man is.
"History does not refer merely, or even principally, to the past. On the contrary, the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do." - James BaldwinThis past weekend we had the chance to work and learn together with some amazing students visiting us from out of town. The students and their advisor visited us from The MET School in Providence, Rhode Island. The MET School was founded by Dennis Littky and Elliot Washer as the first of a growing network of The Big Picture Company's amazing examples of alternative learner-centered schools across the country that take the approach of "one student at a time". The MET School has also been a long time mentor school to the Coalition of Essential School's national network of schools.

I love doing these types of things on Sundays. Things I don't need to do; things that I'm doing mostly for the pleasure of the slow, methodical process it takes to do them. Obsessively folding my underwear into neat little stacks. Refolding them if they aren't perfectly smooth and identical in shape and size to the one underneath it. This is the kind of stuff that fills me with that warm, glowy feeling of contentment. The kind of thing that recharges me for the impending week of tasks I actually have to accomplish.

Now we just have to open the free account and take advantage of this great service (though let it be noted that the “high yield” interest rate on this checking account isn’t all that high).

H1N1 is in the Marciniak house, and I can't come to any other conclusion other than I was a mule for the swine. For those far removed from the drug trade, a mule is an individual who personally smuggles illegal substances into the country, either strapped to themselves, smuggled in luggage or in cars, or ingested and retrieved later in a mode that needs no explanation. Usually a mule is a person down on their luck and willing to put themselves at risk for meager compensation. Emergency nurses reading this may recognize themselves in the previous statement, PPE notwithstanding (PPE is medical techno-speak for personal protective equipment - you know, masks, gloves, gowns, tiarras, pumps, whatever).
Characters: (4/10) – Back in the lead role is Perseus, who has now had a son with his love interest from the first movie, Io, named Heleus. Io never actually appears in Wrath, having died off-screen of the dreaded ‘Written out of the script because Gemma Arterton had better things to do’ disease, so our new love interest role will have to be filled by the returning Andromeda, who was actually Heleus’ mother in Greek mythology anyway. Andromeda, as I said, is the only major character from Clash to be recast, but not only that, she seems to be an entirely different person in Wrath. In the space of ten years, she seems to have become some kind of badass warrior queen with a deadly army at her disposal, and she’s the first person that Perseus hits up for help when he’s guilted into rescuing his father from the depths of Tartarus, where the titans are imprisoned. Actually, this was one of the single most disappointing aspects of Wrath to me, in some ways worse than the fact that the father-son bond between Perseus and Heleus is barely even touched on in this sequel. The gods don’t really do anything, and don’t feel like a real threat. Their powers barely even make an appearance! At least in Clash, you got the impression that the gods were, you know, GODS! In Wrath, the gods just sit there squabbling and bitching while the titan that sired Zeus and Hades, Kronos, comes ever closer to being freed. I know that this jealous, petty Greek god personality is a factor, but Wrath just tries to make things so gritty and melodramatic, that it sucks every air of a possible fantastical element out of the characters, further contributing to everyone feeling like a hollow personality in a hollow movie. The only god that comes close to feeling like a god is Ares, and even he’s basically just a super-strong brute that exists solely to get in Perseus’ way, then whine about how Perseus is the favourite son. Yes, the GOD OF WAR has an inferiority complex in this movie… Words fail me there. Anyhow, while Zeus and Hades spend most of the movie snapping at each other in Tartarus as Zeus’ life force is drained away, at least the third penultimate god, Poseidon, tries to have a larger bearing on the plot this time, having a son of his own that Perseus needs to locate the island where he can find a weapon capable of destroying Kronos. This son is Argenor, who is supposed to be the movie’s wisecracker, and, as Andromeda delicately puts it, “A liar, and a thief”. Of course, as you can expect, this is never really delved into, since Argenor accepts his destiny as the demigod son of the sea god with minimal resistance and a can-do attitude, somehow being completely trustworthy because the plot says so. At least Argenor actually gets in a few amusing lines, and he’s the only character that occasionally makes Perseus fun, since Sam Worthington and Tony Kebbell actually have surprisingly solid chemistry. For the most part though, everybody is just incredibly bland. They’re all so lifeless. Even the gods in this movie feel so flaccid and empty as far as personality goes. Thankfully, the middle portion of the movie gets elevated somewhat by Hephaestus, the fallen craftsman of the gods played by Bill Nighy, who has gone a bit nuts in his exile, let’s just leave at that. Argenor and Hephaestus are still shallow, but at least they’re occasionally entertaining. Even the movie’s main threat, Kronos, barely has any life to him, despite being the father of Zeus and Hades, and the grandfather of Perseus. In the end, he’s nothing more than a cool, but emotionally bankrupt special effect, which just feels like a huge wasted opportunity. I know you don’t see a movie like Wrath of the characters, but for a fantasy movie, you’ll really wish that things were at least somewhat fantastical in the end, which they never seem to be.

The botheration actuality is that Nintendo is so built-in with its own family-friendly angel that even third affair developers can't breach through its connotation. What is bald is a cast that is afar with, but still controlled by, Nintendo. Imagine traveling into a bold store, and you see on affectation the Nintendo Wii, a alpine white box with a Remote ambassador and a cartoony sports package, and the Sora Revolution*, a collapsed atramentous box with a Archetypal Ambassador and a aphotic fantasy adventitious about a adolescent man who gets affronted into a wolf (we'll pretend for the annual of this archetype that you can play Twilight Angel with a Archetypal Controller). Which of these do you anticipate would abode to the "hardcore" gamer? How about the Nintendo DS adjoin the Sora Nitro*?

If there is anything I wish I could change about the book it would be that Moskowitz had filled in the world that she had created a little more. I would have loved to learn more about the different creatures that lived in it. However, this is only a minuscule want on my part and I really don't feel that it takes anything away from the story itself.

If this is the case then you will almost certainly spend your time thinking about why you're not having any ideas, considering whether you were ever really able to have ideas, whether anyone else has noticed that you're not having anything like £230 of ideas per day, that it's no wonder your girlfriend left you and that you might as well just go and tell the creative directors that there's been a huge mistake and ask them plangently why, if they'd wanted the job done properly, they employed an 8 year old to do it in the first place?

So – it’s a real thing, and we should be concerned. But preventive measures can be taken – satellites can be sent offline during big flares, power grids and communication networks can be shielded against electromagnetic radiation and so on. As Dr Bamford says: “The extreme events like the 1859 Carrington Event are 1-in-100-year probabilities, about the same probability as a storm of the level of Katrina hitting New Orleans – and New Orleans did not build their defences to withstand the extreme-but-unlikely magnitude. 100 years isn’t that long.

I love love love love love it. Even if I do look a bit like a little teddy bear in it. It has no shape, it's just a fur barrel of warmth. There's sort of an ageist thing around here that only older ladies wear minks. I am still a bit young to be sporting the fur, ok, to be honest, right on the edge, but shit, I got tired of being cold and wanted something I could throw on and guarantee that I would not be cold. I figure, I am tall enough, perhaps hip enough, and young enough to carry it off ironically, especially since my hair is still long and wild and not short and 'set' like the older ladies. Plus I wear it with Frye biker boots. Old ladies don't wear Frye biker boots, do they?

For that first try with fresh bean water, the alum mordanted skeins in the turtle bean water gave us a slightly more purpley blue, while the black beans had a slight green hue to the blue. The heuchera mordanted skein gave us a lovely grey but no blue, although I should note here that when I prepped those I hadn’t yet realised the mistake I’d made in measuring the heuchera. This Heuchera mordanted yarn was therefore mordanted only with 1/5 of the strength of the later heuchera mordanting.

My first review appeared in the May 2010 Cheap Eats issue - a fitting theme for this cheap 'n' cheerful fan.

The result is this excerpt from a scene in the book:
And our “habitual” continual obedience is an absolute requirement for His Covenant. There is no room for our unwillingness to obey and walk as Jesus’ walked. But Jesus showed the way & became an emotional advocate for us with the Father when we sin and fall from time to time eveyday. If we come to Jesus in repentance HE will emotionally advocate & reconcile you with the Father again!! He knows what we feel and go through, and loves us and wants to reconcile us when we mess up. There is a vast difference between continued-wilfullness and when we become resistent to His grace at times!!

The other benefit of the KDP Select program is that Prime Members can check it out for free. I can't imagine anyone would use their check-out on a 99 cent short story, so I doubt I will see any income generated from that. The drawback as I've stated in the past, is that in order to use the KDP Select Program I have to list the book exclusively on Amazon for 90 days. Fret not, Amazon does have free applications that can be downloaded so anyone can read this book on other devices. I think being it's a short story it's more likely that will happen than if it was a full length novel.

It’s not just that the ends do not justify the means (though they don’t), you will never achieve the ends at all unless the means are themselves a model for the world you wish to create. Hence the famous anarchist call to begin “building the new society in the shell of the old” with egalitarian experiments ranging from free schools to radical labour unions to rural communes.
It was only when I was two-thirds of the way through these three short stories, with not even a nipple in sight, that I realised I was reading the opposite of an erotic novel: an early 19th-century tale of upper class society that doesn’t even dare use the word ‘sex.’ (I had, of course, somehow confused ‘The Marquise of O-’ with ‘The Story of O,’ far less wholesome fare). However, within the confines of 19th century mores, the main story is amusingly risque: as the introduction puts it, it is “…a love story that has at its heart a rape.”

It also demands persistence, which brings luck. In 1604 Dee complained to James I about an English exiled traitor who in 1592 had slandered him as the ‘Conjuror’ to Elizabeth’s Privy Council. No Dee scholar for three hundred years had been able to find this slander. On yet another late night I was reading a nineteenth-century edition of the ‘Douai Diaries’, documents concerning the former Catholic seminary in northern France. It reprinted words first published by the Jesuit Robert Parsons in 1601. Parsons quoted a letter of 1592 from the English exile Cardinal William Allen, who claimed that in late 1591 Lord Burghley had frightened Elizabeth into changing her policy of ‘not making windows into men’s souls’, and allowing a nation-wide pogrom against English Catholics, because Dee had ‘conjured’ to predict that the Spanish would conquer England in 1592.

At one point during the day, I caught an episode of Oprah on TV. That damn Oprah, she always gets to me. During this episode there was an expert that was talking about intuition. He said that humans are the only animals that ignore their intuition. We’re the only animals that explain away our common sense, ignore the feeling in our guts that says something is just not right. If a deer hears a noise in the bushes, he doesn’t run in to investigate. He goes the other way. Why don’t we, as humans, do this?
It doesn’t stop there of course, the simulator phase is yet to come and that starts on Sunday. I’m really excited and eager to get in the simulator and get flying. My last Virtual Flight Deck lesson yesterday was quite successful, my simulator partner and I were able to pull off the set route without a hitch and I came away feeling very happy with it. With all of the ground school study I’ve found it hard to justify learning the SOP’s properly as the most pressing studying has been to get the Airbus information learnt for the exam and I’m glad that I’m now able to direct my focus towards the SOPs now.
My eyes are dimmed with sorrow, worn out because of all my foes.
This policy is enacted fairly often in some markets because of the lack of timely sellouts (or lack of sellouts altogether) — in the last two years, blackouts have occurred for games of the Chargers, Bills, Bucs, Bengals, Raiders, and Lions. However, this policy never enters the mind of fans of clubs that routinely sellout their home games, such as the Packers, Redskins, Broncos, Steelers, Giants, Jets, 49ers, Bears, Cowboys, and Patriots. None of those teams have had home games blacked out since 1993 — the first four teams listed have never had a blackout since the 1973 policy was enacted.

But here is what was acceptable: According to the Guardian, we sent a Pakistani doctor and a medical team into the region, where they announced they were giving out hepatitis B vaccinations. After giving one round of doses—of what should have been a three-dose course—to children in a poor neighborhood, for cover, they skipped the remaining vaccinations and moved on to where Bin Laden was living.

Media coverage of the event has been extensive but mostly poor. Thanks to Nick Pope a reporter from The Sun came along; sadly her coverage of the conference was a novelty story; see: http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3738573/At-UFO-conference-in-Leeds-its-claimed-Olympics-will-be-Independence-Day-style-bloodbath.html I know there’s an old saying that goes: “The only bad publicity is no publicity” and I take comfort from that, and I suppose we should thank Popey for arranging it; however the article is misleading and insulting. The last sentence suggests that the entire Exopolitics community is merely a money-making scam by Anthony Beckett. £99 is actually fairly reasonable for a three-day event and the accommodation at the University is very cheap. At the end of the day this hit-piece was hardly unpredictable; the article may have been bad, but it was not as bad as I was expecting it to be. My expectations of The Sun cannot be undercut! Nick’s own comments did not help I must say; the word “Militant” has a lot of negative baggage in Britain. For many Sun-readers it may well refer to the “Liverpool Revolution” in the 1980’s when the far-leftist Militant Tendency, named after their Militant newspaper, almost took over the Labour Party. I was not interviewed, but if I had been I’d have stated my definition for the word Exopolitics as “UFOlogists who’ve finally made up their mind”. Rather than continue with the scientific investigation over the question of whether UFO’s exist we’ve decided that the answer is undoubtedly “Yes” and now we want to do something about it.

From Haiti there are several bus companies that do daily runs into Santo Domingo. We went with Capital Coach Lines, but there is also Caribe Tours. Sorry, I don’t have a website for them. With Capital Coach Lines you can book tickets online through Paypal (either with an account or with a credit card). The cost was $75 US round trip, which was completely reasonable. The busses were comfortable and clean. They served a sandwich, fruit juice and water on each trip. We did the 8 am both ways, which I would recommend because you never know how long you’re going to get held up at the border. Each passenger is allowed 2 50lb bags each way.

Opinion: Aeneas was, in Greek mythology, a leader of the Trojan forces and a favourite of Apollo and Aphrodite, who was also his mother. His exploits were detailed in Virgil’s famous Aenied. However, any Aeneas nowadays would have his name mispronounced and misspelled by any who never studied Greek mythology. Aeneas is difficult to spell, pronounce and look at. It has a strange, slightly off sound (that is a bit too close to anus to be good). I would not recommend it to anyone. Try another mythological hero, history buffs!
The allegation I utterly refuse to believe is that Berlusconi has had sexual congress with multiple high-class harlots in his “bunga-bunga” parties. Aside from the fact that “bunga-bunga” means “masturbation” in the Congo, the statue incident proves beyond doubt that he prefers watching to participating. A wily old goat like Silvio knows better than to endanger his health by allowing whores to milk his waning gonads. When a man gets to his age, vicarious titillation is a safer option than the real McCoy.

Considering another angle: The objective truth is that the world is round, and yet there are those who are members of the Flat Earth Society who still believe it is flat. In the end, no matter what the subjective opinions or philosophies may be, the world is round. How precisely “round” the world is, well, perhaps that’s relative.

The first of these relates to the aftermath of the recent referendum in Switzerland, where 57.5% of Swiss voters voted in favour of a proposal banning the building of Islamic minarets.

We must make America stronger by being more independent (e.g., controlling our own energy resources) but by also understanding that we cannot be an island. The world is looking to us for leadership, and if we create a void someone WILL come to fill it, and it might not be a someone we want to see. With leadership comes great responsibility, so any actions we take had best be considered carefully, and not just shot from the hip. Unless, of course, the situation dictates that we don’t have time to deliberate.

I have been using the healthy night light in my bedroom, as I thought it would be good as we put the baby's bassinet in our room for the first few months. My bedroom has always felt stuffy to me, especially at times when my husband seems to sweat a lot in bed. I have definitely felt the room seems fresher since putting the healthy night light in it. The night light is a perfect level of light, as it is not too bright, but has enough to give the room some light. I originally had it in my sons room, but decided to try it in my room because I felt my room needed more freshening seeing it is warmer, dustier, and the pets go in our room more. I am thinking I need to get one for each of the bedrooms now.

Dada was parent helper again in AJ's room. This is the last week of preschool. AJ brought watermelon slices & animal crackers to share for snacktime. I can't believe he's almost done with preschool forever! He's been there since he was 2 1/2 years old...

I was on board with the idea of a jaded public, and the demise of the once great dinosaur spectacular. I was also willing to journey with the circus folk as they endeavoured to take their last few dinosaur performers back to the plateau of El Grande in Venezuela where the ‘saurs used to live. But the trek back to the lost world was so boring!
Brigid was a remarkable woman, and despite the numerous legendary and even fantastic miracles attributed to her, there is no doubt that her spirituality, charity, and compassion for those in need were real.
Core constructed is personally my favorite format to play. Only the cards from the last two blocks are legal for play in a Core Constructed deck, which means you don’t have to spend too much money on buying too many different boosterboxes. Keep in mind that the individual sets are not rotated out when a new set is released. Currently (at this time of writing) the Core blocks are block 5 (Worldbreaker Block) and block 6 (Aftermath Block). If you are unsure of which sets belong to which blocks, you can take a look at the Blocks article I posted before.
It is no longer shocking to hear that leaders of states that have engaged in alleged human rights abuses are unable to travel abroad without fear of arrest, indictment, and prosecution. Several senior level George W. Bush administration officials, including President Bush himself, have been the targets of international legal efforts at prosecution due to human rights abuses perpetrated in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. The former foreign minister of Israel, Tzipi Livni, has had to cancel numerous trips to the United Kingdom because of efforts to hold her legally accountable for Israel’s wholesale massacre of hundreds of Palestinians civilians from December 2008 through January 2009. Once one of the most powerful men in the world, Henry Kissinger is no longer able to travel internationally because of similar trepidation. This is, however, a recent phenomenon in international politics. While the Nuremberg trials are perhaps the first such efforts to hold leaders individually and criminally accountable for human rights abuses, such prosecutions have only taken a more frequent and salient role in international politics since the 1970’s when they were first employed by Greece and Portugal. Indeed, as a generally accepted normative concept, the notion that individual leaders should be held criminally responsible for human rights abuses is an evolving phenomenon that has only been recently institutionalized and instantiated internationally by the 1998 Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court. Yet, the “justice norm” and the ICC itself remain problematic, as major powers are reluctant to fully compromise the sovereign immunity of their leaders.

Of course, I have no idea where I am. I am wandering and I am transported to exactly where I'm supposed to be. I am lost and I have never been so at home anywhere. The damp curls my hair and I smile.
At the cusp of the technological Singularity, the Artilect War is raging. Cosmists, intent on creating strong artificial intelligence, subjugate the rejective and regressive Terrans, who want to halt the evolution of humans. Many Terrans even reject the label “Terran,” because of its association with the Cosmists. Prejudice and discrimination against Terrans lead to mass protests, rioting, and terrorism. The Terrans outnumber the Cosmists, and many universities, laboratories, and think-tanks are bombed. But the Cosmists out-think the Terrans, and accelerating technology stacks the odds in evolution’s favor. Mass Terran suicides are common.

I hope everyone will forgive me. This past week has been a blur to me and I am joining my friend Suzanne to update you on the Shannon story. As we worked together to get a quilt to the family of Shannon, the four year old little girl with brain cancer passed away. We respect her family as they ask for privacy during this difficult time.

My dream experienced a time jump here and during that lapse, had been converted into an airforce hanger. For Nazis. Why no one in my neighborhood had been aware of this change or cared enough to stop it was never explained, but there you go. Obviously, this bothered me as a young Jewish woman. My home is directly next door. I work here. And I certainly do not want to work for Nazis somewhere on the first floor of the new building. Apparently they liked me more than I liked them because my office was large and very beautiful.
And you’ve hit the wall. No matter how hard you try, you can’t absorb any more information, and sitting in the library is driving you crazy. So what do you do? Check Facebook?

Here at The New Hotel which was an amazing experience! This boutique motel has only 10 rooms. The woman at “reception” which is a small office next to the restrooms at the pool was so accomedating. This cute deco, 2-level spot has a nice pool in the back and a bar/restaurant that opens mid day. The music changes as does this time in the day. Starting off with classical in the morning, then onto the 80′s such as The Cure, around 2 pm…as the night progresses and “Lou’s Beer Garden” at the pool gets groovin’, so do the tunes! The food is wonderful and so is the beer selection. Oh! the best part, they have FREE BIKES for your use while you stay! You can take it the whole day if you like! And it’s the most scenic way to get around MIami Beach!

June was a crazy busy month: happy hour, Salsa on the Square, The Little Black Dress Event, Tri-State Antique Market, vacation in Atlanta, two weddings, Charlaine Harris, and Red, Pink, and Blue.
Three years later, surprisingly, I was given another three red roses on Valentine’s Day. It was another typical day for me. There he was, handing me a box of chocolate roses and another three real red roses. I smiled and it was all that way.
A while ago this would gladly go as my motto… but now I have my doubts. A few more drunken blunders and maybe I could jump up and die. There is no doubt that the ratio of drinking has gone high over the last few years… especially since I joined the gang. Hope my parents never read this. So here is a list of all the deadly, embarrassing and shameful blunders I have done, seen my friends do and heard of … Yaah don’t expect me to tell you which ones were done by me.

Mexican nationals who live in their residences for 5 years or more are capital gains tax exempt. They need to prove that the residence is their primary residence and need to provide proof of utility bill payments, property tax payments in order to qualify for this exemption. Foreigners too can qualify for a tax exemption as well, but it is a bit more difficult and complicated. A foreigner too needs to prove that the residence is their primary residence, that they have been out of the country no more than 183 days of the past 365 days FM3 or no more than 30 days in the case of an FM2, provide proof of utility bills paid in their name and the address in question for a minimum of three months prior to the sale (some Notarios required require longer proof), bank account statements here in Mexico and in the case of a fideicomiso, depending on Notario, additional items may be required due to the property being held in a trust with beneficial rights of use, as opposed to the rights of real property. Always check with the Notario who closes your real estate transaction or another other Notario of your choosing and keep informed periodically of any changes in the law regarding obtaining any capital gains exemptions available on your property. Some Notarios will only accept an FM2 for consideration of capital gains exemptions. There are also some controversies regarding a fideicomiso and its ability to meet the letter of the law to qualify for capital gains exemptions. Do tax planning, just like you would if you were in the United States or Canada.
2) It gives critics yet another excuse to ridicule comics (like they need another one!). It really annoys me when comic books are dismissed as ‘superhero nonsense’ and ‘kids stuff’. It is also a really lazy description, at least 25 years out of date.

The world was harsh on the Parenthood TV series and it quickly disappeared from our screens despite have a cast of child actors that included David Arquette, Thora Birch and Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes, that’s right – David Arquette and Leonardo DiCaprio shared a screen. Parenthood, the 1990 series, was cancelled by NBC after only 12 episodes so naturally twenty years later NBC decided to remake Parenthood… again.

I've been learning and growing in my time management skills as I've had to figure out how to balance being a wife, mother, apartment manager and friend this year. It has proven to be good, hard work as I learn the importance of putting the needs of my husband and kids before work and household chores. I never realized how hard it would be to put the laundry down or leave a sink full of dirty dishes so that I could play and spend quality time with my boys!

Nassau County Commissioner of Investigations and County Attorney John Ciampoli said that he showed the letter to former prosecutors in his office, and to a retired appellate court judge – all of whom expressed shock that an elected official would put in writing a “threat to hold a vote hostage.” Ciampoli said he then referred the letter to the New York State Inspector General’s Office.

It’s the quotations from the book, however, that show how conservatives think of their world and those around them. Sarah Mimms, writing in the National Journal, has pulled together some choice bits to save the rest of us the time and money to read the book. She describes her method as the “excerpt lottery,” in which page numbers are chosen based upon recent winning lottery numbers from various states.

And whilst this has been a pretty challenging week on the health front, I've been determined not to let that spoil the lovely memories of time spent with family and celebrating being a mum last weekend. And the phrase above is so apt...rather than wallow in 'woe is me' with how sick I've been, it is SO true that there is ALWAYS something you can be thankful for. So here's my thankfulness for the week:

Then it was my turn, you stared at me for what seemed like eternity and yet I know it was no more than three and a half heartbeats in the real world. When your lips touched mine, I knew that this our goodbye kiss. Not the last time that I would kiss you before you left but our real good-bye kiss. Knowing that allowed me to memorize it completely. Your hand on my waist and the other on the back of my neck, my hands on your chest covering your heart. I leaned in hoping the smell of you would stay with me. You pulled me close until I wondered if you weren’t trying to melt me into you and take me with you when you left. Your lips lingered on mine even after you stopped kissing me as if you wanted to give me your breath and steal mine at the same time. I remembered when you used to do that and I would tell you that I could feel your smile; that memory made the tears fall.
Okay, hi again everyone. Wow. I like this feeling. I’m posting a lot more regularly, and it feels good. So I said yesterday that I was going to write a blog for you guys today. Oh wait, no I didn’t. Scratch that. I’m gonna blog for you now, and tell you what happened today.

If you have finished reading this post, you will know of my struggles. You will know what I have spent the past 10 minutes doing. I am stressing out, but I managed to complete a blog post without clicking on anything. You are nodding in respect at my journey and how I overcame this early morning technological hurdle. Thank you.

In my novel, none of my female POV characters have children. All of them can match male crew members in physical roles. They are not subservient to men. The ship’s commander and chief engineer are both women. Seven out of the eleven crew members are women. As a result, I am writing the women a lot more like men.
Andrea came for a English conversation lesson as he does every Saturday morning. He is 25, tall, slim and predictably good-looking. His manners are impeccable. He has a degree in engineering and a good job, a nice new car, a very attractive girlfriend who he will almost certainly marry and they will have two gorgeous children and a wonderful, happy, fulfilled life together. All in all he is an extremely nice, decent chap. Obviously I dislike him intensely.
And all good things must come to an end. Goodbye.

When McElwee arrives in North Carolina, his family talks him into joining them on an outing — one that just happens to include many young, single women. As his relatives keep telling the filmmaker, he "needs a nice Southern girl" to help him get over the breakup. McElwee's mind, which can't get focused on his documentary, isn't really prepared to leap back into the dating pool, saying in voiceover, "The mere thought of trying to meet someone depresses me." It's the beginning of many memorable sequences as McElwee films some sort of event where "various men compete in demonstrations of strength and virility." It leads to the first classic scene of Sherman's March when his newlywed sister takes him out in a canoe (along with a dog) and rails against his ex, saying she could leave her husband anytime she got bored if she wanted to but she doesn't because that would be "bullshit." She does suggest to her brother that he could "tidy up a bit" in terms of appearance if he really wanted to attract someone and suggests that his movie camera could be used as a natural tool of flirtation. "You have an instant rapport with people because you have a camera," she tells him and McElwee wonders if she could be right, despite his past relationship wreckage.

Anyway, at least they’re having a world event like this to account for a possible change in leadership. It would kind of suck if you just logged on one day and the old leader was gone and the new leader was in place and the whole damn world had just gone topsy-turvy overnight.
Kindle briefly changed that, because it was a new gizmo and that meant all the 'early adopters' - people who are interested specifically in new technology - got into reading ebooks. This is a group of people who tend to be heavily engaged in social networking (because it's the only thing besides GPS that justifies owning a smartphone). They're also people interested in the technology for its own sake. They're interested in who made it. That means that when looking for content, they're going to go to the technology's source as much as to usual content sources.

Today was a run around town, which felt great! I did 4 or so miles. It's a beautiful fall day in New England so it was quite nice. Will most likely run some more tomorrow and get in some yoga... it's time to get back to what I thought was going to turn into a weekly yoga habit. Must do it for real this time!!!
Still by the end of the demo, I went home with an uncarved sample block with the intention of using it one day. In the meantime, I turned my detailed designs into magnesium plates. Then got braver and tried out the polymer plates a few months later. I never looked back at the lino block because the impressions I got from my plates were clean, crisp and deep.

A few raised beds are specified in this design in the common area. More space is available for raised beds to the right of this plan, between the parking lot and the fence along the property line.
I've said this before - I blog for several reasons. It started out as a way to connect with out-of-state family and has morphed into several things since then, but the most important reason I continue to blog is because this is my kids' virtual scrapbook. Their poor neglected paper baby books are pretty barren and have minimal to no stories in them at all. Blogging is a way for us all to remember our lives - the good, the bad, and the ugly. I think keeping track of our story will mean a lot to them when they are older - that we value them as people and we love them to pieces, no matter what.
It’s time to announce the Ballerina of the Month!!! First of all, thank you all for waiting so patiently for this. It has been a while since the post came out. Second, I’d like to say that all of the ballerina’s in this world are WONDERFUL and one really isn’t better than the other. Anyway, I’m sure you’re all dying to figure out who is this month’s winner so…..

I know you are from Atlanta, but the city has almost 7,000 churches. Did you ever consider another location for your new church?
A few weeks ago the circus was in town and we really considered taking the girls. We pondered this for about 5 minutes before it dawned on us that taking our monkeys to the circus would not be the best idea. The last thing we need or want is for them to get any ideas on new behaviors to try out at home.
It hasn't just opened my eyes to the battle of others either, but also, to my faith, it's solid foundation and it's ability to be questioned. I realized how blessed I am, how loved I am, and how fragile we all really are. For the fact is... we spend our whole lives avoiding the fact that we will one day die.

Which is why when he joins the Classics Club, it’s such a big surprise. It turns out that he was requested to by his older sister to do so, who, as someone with an extensive knowledge of martial arts, would likely make it painful for him if he were to refuse. The reason is that she was a member in her high school years, and it is in danger of being abolished due to a lack of members.

Yesterday was so extremely busy, running here, there, and everywhere, that by the time we got to actually watch the movie, it was after 10 p.m. On a school night.
The RV sites are a bit rustic and there are lots of trees for summer shade. It smells of pine and spruce when I go out in the morning. I was thinking we would all be parked in rows in a parking lot, so this was a nice surprise.

The second view is that of the Christian Sabbath as defended by Joseph A. Pipa. Like McCarty, Pipa begins in Genesis and uses some of the same texts to ground the nature of the Sabbath command. As a continuationist for the Ten Commandments, Pipa sees a moral grounding, as opposed to ceremonial grounding, for the Sabbath command and therefore believes it is binding on the NT believer. Pipa holds that since the Ten Commandments are not ceremonial law, having their grounding in creation and the law, provide the basis for the rest of the Mosaic law and are repeated in the NT they are still applicable for the NT believer. Pipa believes that the command to the keep the Sabbath is about the seventh day of the week and not necessarily tied to Saturday. Since the Ten Commandments are not ceremonial or judicial they are not fulfilled in the sense of abrogating their use or applicability for the Christian. Christ does fulfill them but does not end them. Pipa rightly contends that the resurrection of Christ is the defining event that the NT church recognized as shifting the Sabbath rest from Saturday to Sunday. Before the resurrection the basis for Saturday Sabbath was creation and the Exodus. Since the resurrection, Sabbath is remembered in celebration of and on the day of the resurrection event – Sunday. When it comes to observing the Sabbath Pipa argues that the believer is to rest short of works of necessity (preparing food or feeding animals) and mercy (tending to medical emergencies, helping a neighbor fix their car so they can get to work the next day or certain types of businesses that cannot shut down on Sunday). Admittedly, this leaves room for much “work” to be done in Sunday. I personally find this view to be the most convincing.

I took off her diaper, she sat down on the potty for a few seconds, stood up, looked back but the potty was empty. She sat down again, waited for a few seconds, stood up, look back but the potty was empty. This pattern repeated a few times and then she was over it.
A few buildings were superficially damaged, but there have been no reports of serious injuries. For example, the National Cathedral has some damage to one or more of its spires. The quake triggered an immediate exodus from D.C., and so rush hour began at 2:00 rather than 4:00.
I knew a guy that did this once. Everyone called him diaper after that and he never got a girlfriend again. If you were a chick and you saw a group of guys, you wouldn’t be sniffing around the one they all call diaper now, would you?

Second, and this is probably just me, the position of the friend filming Paige and Leo’s wedding does not match up with the angle the of video when we see it played back later. The friend filming can be seen standing on the same side as the friend conducting the ceremony when we first see their wedding. When the video is played back, the video looks as if it was shot from the audience’s point of view from when we first saw the wedding.

The positives mostly outweigh the negatives. Slates shows a nice command of film space in the opening scene unfolding under the credits, in which Kirsten walks to work. It may not be immediately apparent to viewers who don't live in Columbia, but the shot sequence gives anyone who DOES live here an idea of exactly where Kirsten lives. There's a coherent geography in the shot sequence and even if you don't know anything about Columbia, you still get the sense of a real place and a real progression through that space. Slates doesn't obscure any of this with tricky camera editing, either. This may be a super-low budget indie film, but that hasn't stopped the filmmakers from making a movie that's almost classical in its construction. They've eschewed the hand-held camera preferred by a lot of indie films in favor of specific, well chosen static shots and carefully considered traveling shots that serve the scene rather than call attention to themselves. The movie LOOKS great, too. It was shot on a Red One camera, but it doesn't look like it. This is a movie with bright, summery light and saturated colors. (In contrast, a lot of films shot with a Red are made to look monochrome and gloomy--Winter's Bone, which was also shot in Missouri, is a good point of comparison). Kudos to cinematographer Dave Anderson. This is mostly story-oriented filmmaking, in which the camera does not call attention to itself. It makes the movie go down easy. There's also an unexpected element of horror in this movie, which tickles my own sensibilities. The injury Kirsten Suffers from the whip-it is ghastly and its impact is all the stronger for being completely out of left field. Better still, the effects are seamless, something with which some low budget films struggle.

Gamescom is Europe’s biggest trade and public game show: it’s basically our answer to E3. Anybody who is anybody is there and, as it happens, I’ll be there as part of EA’s ground zero media team, writing everything up, interviewing duders and dudetters and driving myself into the ground with the most exciting trip into Europe I’ve had since the first time I went to Disneyland. And Disneyland had a pool, which speaks volumes about how much this sort of thing means to me.

If he loses these customers to the supermarkets, he argues, Britain will be poorer for it. “Being a cider farmer is like being part scrap man, part gypsy. We have a roguery. These old boys keep it real. Without them we lose our mystique. We’ll be forced into the living death of National Trust shops. This is an issue about the popular traditions of rural England that goes far beyond those who will actually be affected. Anyone who’s seen or read about Jez Butterworth’s play Jerusalem will understand this. I’d expect pretty much all farmhouse cidermakers to be in areas represented by Tory or LibDem MPs. Yes, I know it’s special pleading, but let’s hope they get a lot of flak about it and it helps undermine the whole policy.

It was similar to the haul that the Denver Nuggets received last year for Carmelo. But now, the Hornets are left with 66 games of Chris Paul and then he is gone.

How did Disneyland end up employing dozens of our feline friends? In the late 1950s, the Sleeping Beauty castle underwent a major renovation. Guess who construction works found squatting inside the castle? Over a hundred Orange County alley cats. Along with a huge number of fleas! Disneyland tried to evict the cats, but to no avail. And then a bright Disneyland employee mentioned how they weren't having the problems with rodents that once plagued the Park. And, voila, the furry workers were hired! Without an interview!

In an effort to refine our strategy for reaching folks, we are going to do a little research. The goal is to put a survey in front of a sample of A&M students, with the questions designed to characterize the needs, anxieties, and any religious leanings of the student population. For now, we are working on the design of the survey. We want a set of questions that will reveal the optimal approach to take for engaging students’ interest. I’ve put some work into this recently, but the creative juices are rather dry at the moment (have been busy wrapping up end-of-semester stuff). Maybe publicly admitting as much will kick-start the question-writing process. – Alan

As the above picture clearly illustrates, we brewed the beer on a Sunday morning, and many of us had had a late Saturday night. Luckily we had donuts from Acme Donuts, and not much work to do for a lot of the time. Some drinking was done and it was decided that we all really like Green Flash "Rayon Vert", as well as The Commons "Flemish Kiss", both dry hopped, brett-aged belgian pale ales inspired by Orval.

The job of PR professionals can be very exciting, but also stressful. They are responsible for how the public perceives their client. They also have deadlines to meet and time contraints that can affect their work. However, their tasks do vary, which makes each day in the job different. The work environment may not always be ideal for everyone, but for those who have good cimmunication and writing skills it could be perfect. The variety and vast range of tasks and duties could also be very appealing to certain people.

The Marine Mother's prayer says, "Dear Lord, Give me the greatness of heart to see the difference between a mother's love and duty to country. Give me understanding that I may know, when duty calls them they must go. Give me a task to do each day, to fill my thoughts when they're away. And Lord, when they're in a foreign land, keep them safe in your loving hand. And Lord, when duty is in the field, please protect them and be their shield. And Lord, when deployment is so long, please give me the support to remain strong. Amen."
Experts’ debate vigorously about the technique employed to calculate the ERP and, of course, the resulting answer but why does the ERP matter? In modern portfolio theory, the ERP helps to set portfolio return expectations and determine asset allocation policy. For example, a higher premium would mean you would invest a greater share of your portfolio into equities. In theory, a stock that is riskier than the market (measured by beta) should offer excess returns above the ERP. The premium is also a key element in many cost of equity models. For example, the capital asset pricing model requires an ERP to compute a cost of equity called the discount rate – the higher the risk premium, the higher the cost of equity.
The Eurasian steppe-tundra was continuously inhabited only in portions of its European end, where it ran farther south because of the large icecap over Scandinavia and where the moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream made the climate moister and milder. Here, the effects of intense sexual selection could accumulate and be passed on from generation to generation. Conversely, northern Asia appears to have suffered episodes of complete depopulation, particularly at the height of the last ice age.

Adia stood and stared blankly at the canvas in front of him, trying to understand the artist’s perspective and purpose of the piece. He tilted his head slightly from left to right in the hope that twisting the painting’s angle would help him comprehend it but to no avail. He moved onto the next painting, his black patent shoes a harsh statement against the bare, clinical white of the gallery’s sparse walls. The sounds of his steps echoed in the emptiness for there was not a single soul besides him present in the gallery so late in the evening. He liked it that way. The stark nakedness gave him room to bury himself deep in his thoughts with no interruption from disruptive, noisy students or clicking heels from the heiresses and collectors who strutted the corridors in search of their next purchase.
Actually Arjuna was engaged in very unpleasant activity on the battlefield, but because he was in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he suffered no reaction. We may be performing some action which we may consider to be very good work, but if we do not perform it in Kṛṣṇa consciousness we have to suffer the reactions. From the material point of view, Arjuna’s initial decision not to fight was a good one, but from the spiritual point of view it was not. When we do pious work, we get certain results. We may take a birth in a very good family, in the family of a brāhmaṇa or a wealthy man, we may become very rich or very learned, or we may become very beautiful. On the other hand, if we do impious work, we may have to take birth in a low class family or animal family, or become illiterate or foolish, or very ugly. Although we engage in very pious work and take a good birth, we will still be subject to the stringent laws of action and reaction. Our principal aim should be to escape the laws of this material world. If we don’t understand this, we will become attracted by aristocratic families, wealth, or a good education or a beautiful body. We should come to understand that despite having all these facilities for material life, we are not free from birth, old age, disease and death. To caution us of this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa warns in Bhagavad-gītā:

I love long silky locks and because of my fine hair I’m prone to tangles and knots, so the idea of giving up conditioner did not sound the slightest bit appealing or even remotely doable. But he insisted my hair would be in much better condition, shinier and hold volume better if I relied on just shampoo and an anti-snap leave in spray by Redken. (At $16, this product is much cheaper in the US than in the UK and Ireland) Basically he said some conditioners make your hair look healthy but it’s all a fleeting illusion. Apparently conditioner is too heavy for fine hair – it leads to a build up of product very quickly, weighing it down so it’s dull and lifeless.

Back to studying and practicing tango, it was to my surprise that in France very few people really study tango, but rather feel that it’s ok to once in a while to the milonga, among their other activities and priorities. On of my explanations is that they have learned to put themselves above things, instead of letting the passion drive them. Another important feature is that French people are in general ‘sober’. They have their eyes open, they plan their lives carefully and to choose what’s best for them. The passion for tango and the blind thirst and devotion to its learning, so common for the tango addicts cannot grow easily in the French. They have ‘better or other things to do as well’ in general, an attitude which may be correct from one point of view, but on the other hand tango demands time and effort…

It's considered the first American musical by many scholars for three reasons: 1) it included newly written songs with previously adapted music; 2) it included a flashy chorus of leggy dancers; 3) its success spawned a slew of 'extravaganzas' that evolve right into today's modern musical productions. By most accounts, it was also, from our perspective, really, really awful.

Winstanley’s group was founded in April 1649 (2 months after Charles I execution) after he had a vision in which he had heard the words “Work together, Eat bread together.”. The diggers soon founded “colonies” of about 50-100 people in Surrey, Nottinghamshire and Buckinghamshire. They where a committed group of Christians and based there way of life on the book of Acts with their cornerstone verse of scripture being: “And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.” (Acts 4vs32 KJV). They farmed the land at a time when the food prices where at a record high and they built and lived in communal houses, living, working and worshiping together. They believed that society had gone off course and so where attempting to build something different as a witness to the world, Winstanley declared “true freedom lies where a man receives nourishment and preservation, and this is in the use of the Earth”.

CBA has followed Spain's Estrella Damm through door number two--removing gluten from barley and brewing it normally. No millet, no sorghum, just regular ingredients processed by removing the gluten. (CBA has lots of information and science behind the testing standards.) I'd love to know the process--I envision hundreds of lab technicians dissecting malt grains and tweezing gluten molecules, but as delightful as that image is, it's impractical and unlikely--but Widmer's not saying. There's other science here I'd like to know more about, like how the two beers, a pale ale and a lager, manage to raise a head without the gluten. Perhaps in time these secrets will emerge.

First, if school is going to be more than a rote-learning factory, and serve to prepare people for the outside world, it is silly to want to it to be free from any controversial ideas, including claims that some ways of living are better than others. This is especially so in high school, where the students can be expected to have the maturity to deal with unpleasant and critical ideas. If it is ok to suppress such ideas in school, is it also ok in university? Why not? There’s a learning environment to foster there, and lots of bleeding hearts who might get offended. Should we summarily fire all the ethicists and political philosophers, most law professors, and countless others who are in the business of telling people that some ways of living are better than others? Or is it enough to just prohibit normative scholarship in curricula?

There are simple guidelines to go by to help you decide whether a medium might be fake or genuine, but sometimes some are just plain egotistical and greedy. I added the latter onto the fake or genuine, because the sad fact is not all people who are naturally gifted mediums are honest or decent with only your interests at heart. They should be but some who start off being genuine and honest can go to the wrong places and be taught it is ok to make big money out of all of this. It is alright to charge for one’s time or services, but by charging we mean reasonable amounts and not silly ones.

How bad is it? How bad will it get? Yes there is a recession in the USA and elsewhere, which is going to require careful (and lucky) management to prevent it developing into something worse. But in Ireland the perception – at least as important as the reality – is that ours is worse. For if the USA has caught a cold, Ireland has caught pneumonia. A joke circulating in Dublin – indignantly rejected by the Government – is that the only differences between Ireland and Iceland (in the grip of an economic meltdown) are one letter and six months. The talk now is not of the recession of the 1980s but of the calamitous 1950s, when hope appeared to disappear and when many families, including my own, left the country.

Jonsi: I think it's cool, quite reminiscent even for me. When I was younger I'd be really excited to go to my local record store and see which band had released an album that week. I see it as being quite nostalgic in that sense. These days I'm pretty bad when it comes to discovering new music. I rarely go out and buy albums, but I like the concept of Record Store Day if it encourages kids from the next generation to seek out new music in the same way I did when I was their age. Nowadays it is so instant to consume music. People don't tend to listen to albums in full any more. They just seem to skip tracks and go to their three favourite songs then onto the next album and so on.

Another practical tip that Jude identifies we should do is praying in the Holy Spirit. What is praying in the Holy Spirit? Firstly, it is an ongoing thing. It isn’t necessarily when you sit down at your bed at night and say your prayers; prayer should be a fluid and progressive element in a Christian’s life. Constantly submitting things to God, talking to God in your mind is what Jude is getting at here.

My breath was getting shorter and it was getting harder and harder to breathe. I got up to look for my family. They were in the dining area pacing around frantically. I overheard my mom saying something. I can’t remember exactly what she said, but it was something along the lines of, “Lauren’s body is in her room and I think she’s dead.” And I become confused because I was right there, in the flesh. To prove them wrong I walked over to the dining room to see what they were talking about.
By his own account, Patrick doesn’t come from a brewing background but he strikes me as a business savvy fellow who has come into brewing in a round about way. One thing’s for sure, Patrick and Perry have their work clothes on and they’re working hard to get the beer brewing and the doors open. Old World Brewery will be the first tenant in the building and already they have installed a stage with lighting and a full drum set. The brewing equipment was purchased from a brewpub in Mississippi who lost their master brewer in 2004 or 2005. Perhaps Mississippi’s loss will be our gain. The plan at this point is to begin brewing the first batch on Wednesday, January 7th and a charity fundraising event is scheduled for January 24th.
Four days left in April. Autism Awareness Month. Of course, those of us living with Autism are aware – nothing will change for us on 1st May. Life goes on as normal (routines etc). April has been about reaching those who aren’t aware – but as I’ve said before “how?” It’s establishing a collective voice and making that voice heard. Thoughts and pondering..

We were so excited to be able to design and have a home built that was perfect for us! So many people talk about how they hated building, and how it is so stressful, and they will never do it again. This was NOT our experience!! I loved it so much! It was so fun. I loved every part. It was so exciting to meet with the draftsman, tell him what we wanted, then see him bring that to life! It was so fun walking through it when it was just studs and picture what it would finally look like. And it was so fun picking out all the details for it...the colors and the sinks and cabinet hardware and lights...I loved it!

We all love a good trend, but when it comes to your wardrobe this should not be the bread and butter of what is in your closet. It's the timeless pieces that will stand the test of time and carry you year after year. Once you fill your closet with the classic "must have" items, you can fill in the gaps with the fun, on-trend items per season.

Yes, that’s what’s happened, and until recently, I found myself spending more time blogging and posting than actually writing. So I’ll keep my website, post a blog every week or so, talk to nice people like Carrie, but do my very best to spend most of my time working on that next book. If I don’t move as much product, so be it. I’m not in it to win it, I’m in it to pen it. Not even close, I know. But you see where I’m going.
2. Manage how to deal with the truth: Brands must be the first to reveal and first to deal with information. But if consumers have gone astray in dealing with it e.g. switching to another brand, getting out of the category, or speaking ill about the product, then the truth must be set straight, public relations controls dissemination, and campaigns can be formed.

However, the drive I took north out of L.A. through the mountains (California Hwy 2, mostly) was another breathtaking display of what Cali has to offer. I love being in Texas, I love the landscape of Austin, and at times I miss the verdancy of the midwest. But man...the varied vistas, the greenery, the floral displays, the ocean scenes, the canyons...it's an unbelievably gorgeous state.
Over on my second favorite site on the ‘net, (For my favorite, see the NB at the end of this post.), Phrontistery, after some extensive checking, I found that not only is there no “Q-mancy,” there are also no “mancies” for the letters “J,” “W,” “V,” or “Y.” This is a disaster of the first magnitude. I shall therefore attempt to come up with words to fill in the gap, and thereby avoid further damage to my native country, “Vocabulandia.” Your generous, tax-deductible donations will go to the restoration and reconstruction currently going on in the cities most affected by this tragedy – namely, Jtown, Qfarington, Wville, Vton, and Ying City.

When I am not in the comforts of my home, my characters are still in my head. Talking and doing naughty stuff. So usually, I’m pulled over on the side of the road, typing out whatever it is on my phone. Or I’m at a hockey game typing my little heart out. It’s crazy and I know people think I’m nuts when my eyes shut a little and my mouth falls open. That’s usually how I look when an idea comes.

For an outside consultant, awareness of the dominant coalition is an essential component to the development of effective strategies and action plans. An incredible strategic plan, officially endorsed at the highest levels, has little chance of success if a shadowy dominant coalition – the real power brokers in an organization – is not involved in the planning effort and fully behind the finished product.
The characteristics of these fossils has placed them tenatively in the same family as Cryptoclidus and Muraenosaurus, and they were thought to have been like the Elasmosaurs but with shorter necks. This is also along the lines of what the surviving Plesiosaurs would have to have been to give rise to our Long-necked Sea-serpents: long-necked, but not excessively long-necked, not so specialised as the extreme Elasmosaurs, and generalised enough to be versatile, possibly enough so that they could pursue other avenues of evolution that became open to them.

Now that the temperatures have dropped far below zero and the snow keeps falling I thought it would be the perfect moment to take out my warmer winter coat. BUT my dad has put it somewhere and he doesn't remember where. So basically he lost my $160 super cosy Zara coat... So I had to go with this one. I was totally freezing!
Then we took the upright posts from a damaged gazebo and turned them into a trellis system. The gazebo used to provide shade to our west facing deck but hurricane related rain and a tarp which was too impervious to water caused the gazebo roof to collapse be unusable. We kept the sides knowing that they could be reused somehow. We found the perfect project! When there is something growing on these trellises, the fan units for the air conditioning system will be shaded. Now, we only turn on our AC for about 6 weeks during our toasty Maryland summers, but we know the AC will operate more efficiently if the fans are shaded. The fans face west with southern exposure as well.

But isn’t mtDNA unresponsive to natural selection? That’s what I used to think. There is growing evidence, however, that some mtDNA loci respond to natural selection. In particular, some haplogroups seem to reflect a trade-off between thermogenesis and ATP synthesis (Balloux et al, 2009). This trade-off might explain differences in disease risk between different mtDNA haplogroups. Haplogroup U, in particular, is associated with a lower risk of glaucoma (Wolf et al., 2010). There also seems to be an age-related association between this haplogroup and risk of Alzheimer’s (Santoro et al., 2010).

The Boer Women's Monument in Bloemfontein, erected in memory of the murdered Boer women and children who died in the British concentration camps written about so eloquently by British pro-Boer campaigner Emily Hobhouse, even became the Afrikaner Women's Monument - a truly vile insult to their memory. The Voortrekker Monument is described in terms which honour the memory of Afrikaners -- not the Boers who had actually undertaken the Great Trek.
To preserve the dialectical reading of his doctrine of scripture in Church Dogmatics, McCormack insists upon an actualist ontology to account for both Barth’s being and becoming. As McCormack argued to evangelicals, “Barth’s understanding of the being-in-becoming of Holy Scripture was a function of his commitment to the being-in-becoming of the God-human.” Everything, including God, has its being-in-becoming, but God does so in an absolute, self-determined sense, avoiding the unorthodox pantheism or panentheism Barth’s German counterparts adopted. Yet humans and their productions, including scripture, have their being-in-becoming only in a relative sense. Scripture has its becoming in the will of God, allowing it to become what is always was, the Word of God for the Church or those that respond in faith and obedience, but barring it from other persons or times at His will. Just as the human Jesus is not divinized and God is indirectly mediated or present in history, so the words of the human authors of scripture are not divinized, only indirectly becoming the Word of God. Therefore, it is the divine act that makes scripture what it is essentially, the Word of God.
You know I'm not a frequent hair-washer, but did you know Mr. Sugarplum colors it? (I get some help in the blonde department. Shocker, I know.) Granted I don't use off-the-shelf box color, since my Nashville bff is a rock-star hairstylist, she keeps me stocked with the good stuff. And even though Mr. Sugarplum does a bang-up job, it doesn't compare to a professional. In the six years we've lived here, I've been relying on him and frequent visits with my friend to keep me from looking like a wildebeest. As hard as it is, it's time to find a local hairstylist. I've got an appointment tomorrow with someone new, and I'm bringing these pictures with me. Does anyone do blonde and bangs better than Reese?

So I went back to the doctor today (well yesterday now that it's after midnight) and had what's called a RF procedure completed. RF stands for Radio Frequency and is where the doctor essentially burns or cauterizes the nerve that is causing the pain. I was having a serious panic attack when I got to the doctor's office because they told me there was not enough time to give me a zanex for my anxiety. The nurse is friends with my brother and the older sister of my brother's ex-girlfriend, who is also my friend. So she tells me that she text my brother this morning to make sure I'm there early so the zanex has time to kick in before my procedure. Yep, sure didn't get that message. So I ask if I could have the IV conscious sedative this time because I had it last time. I didn't want it because it burned like hell and made me cry the last time, but it was better than nothing at all. They tell me that they don't have any there right now so I was SOL. As the nurse is telling me this and explaining for me to get in my gown and little surgery hat and to leave my socks and undergarments on, the surgery nurse pops open my "holding area" door and says they are ready for me. I have a full blown meltdown at that point and start to panic, telling them I'm running out the other door. The nurse explains that I wasn't given the zanex and there is no conscious sedatives there so what does she do because I obviously really need one. The surgery nurse asked if I have a driver (yup, my big brother goes with me since my hubby is gone during the week) and says to give me two zanex because it would kick in almost immediately.

Spent a long, relaxing weekend with family outside of Big D. Mucho fun-o until the rancid jalapeno hot dog weiners invaded the bodies of my mom and her boyf. Ugly scene, folks. My little bro, who is an EMT, made the living room look like an ER with mom hooked up to an IV and meds scattered about. Yikes. Those weiners were the only thing the kiddo and I didn't eat. Whew!

“The belief of God is not a matter of common sense, or logic, or argument, but of feeling. It is as impossible to prove the existence of God as to disprove it. I do not believe in God. I see no need of such an idea. It is incredible to me that there should be an after-life. I find the notion of future punishment outrageous and of future reward extravagant. I am convinced that when I die, I shall cease entirely to live; I shall return to the earth I came from. Yet I can imagine that at some future date I may believe in God; but it will be as now, when I don’t believe in Him, not a matter of reasoning or of observation, but only of feeling.”

"Strange Things" (Toy Story) (Music and lyrics by Randy Newman)
When we married, and started talking about children, Jacob was at the top of our pick of names. Shortly before Lincoln arrived, we knew he wasn't Jacob. We knew he was Lincoln Daniel. Abraham Lincoln and Uncle Dan are two men that he can learn from, and follow in their footsteps. They are men who have a deeply rooted belief in a Supreme Being. By following the examples they have set, he will have the ability to make the right choices; even if he is doing it alone. By learning from them, he will become a righteous young man who loves the Lord. When we found out about Henry, we talked about the name Jacob again. It was still the top of our list (and the rest of America's list too!!!), but we knew he wasn't Jacob. We knew he was Henry Louis. By being named after incredible men who love the Lord, we know that if he becomes even half as wonderful as his Papa, and Henry B Eyring he will become a righteous young man who loves the Lord.

So, in my last post, I let you know that, once again, I was denied an account at BECU. I’ve given up on getting an account there, and am moving on to try local banks. The first step, of course, is looking at their websites to decide which banks will be the best to visit, considering my financial situation. I’ll share the information with you after the page break.
At our first location, a lovely small place called Sir Ben’s (or Sir Benedict’s Tavern), I walked into the place myself, waiting for my coworker to meet up with me. I actually ran into a few coworkers from my other job, and I joined them for my first drink of the night. We were having a good time, I was introduced to a few new people, and eventually it was just me and another coworker of mine whom I would consider a good friend indirectly. I will admit I had a small crush on him for a while, but that’s all it was. A small crush. We talk, joke, give each other crap. He notices things about me when they change, like a hair cut or a new outfit. So, it’s nice…Anyways, we ended up sharing a couple of beers when my friend showed up, and by the time we left, I was feeling the buzz.

The first time I went out for coffee alone I was horribly uncomfortable. I felt awkward, conspicuous and acutely aware of the groups of people congregated at the coffee shop. I skulked over to the nearest table, took out my book and started reading. I tried to flag down a waiter repeatedly, but failed spectacularly. Then to top things off, the menu flew up and hit me on the face (it was one of those open air coffee places. Also, rather windy that day) Mortified, I stuck it out for a few minutes trying to hide behind my paperback and then picked up my dignity and fled.

I have this pattern out and ready to work on. It, too, needs some grading. Probably need to add some darts and do a FBA too.. So many really cute patterns end their sizes at 16 (pattern 16, not real world 16) and a B cup. Well, a real world 16 would be great, but that B cup......that is sooooo not workin for me. LOL
We worked our way around the plate, eating half of each sample so that we could go back a second time to re-try any that we liked. We instantly eliminated the berry creme-related flavors, as the three of us all tend to gravitate towards the richer flavors (I'm a fiend for chocolate). All of us enjoyed the hummingbird flavor; it was one of the most unique cake flavors I have ever had, but it was absolutely to die for! It reminded me of coffee cake almost (it features pecans, pineapple, and banana; it is a southern cake). Although, it did come with a higher price tag per slice than some of the other flavors. After finishing the samples, we each shared which flavor was our favorite. Justin quickly stated that the amaretto was his, and my mom liked the chocolate kahlua creme. I was stuck between the hummingbird cake and the chocolate toffee creme. Thankfully, the cake flavor only has to be solidified a week or two before the wedding, so we had time to think about it at this point before making decisions!

Preheat the oven to 200 degree Celsius. Butter and line one 8" spring form pan or two 6"cake tins (I used two tins).
I set out this morning, with my now on and off beau (you know how that goes) to whip up a delicious French inspired brunch. He wanted pancakes, I wanted something light to keep my figure, so we mutually agreed upon crepes. Only problem is, crepes and maple syrup is blasphemy to the French. I needed to think harder. Why not crepes filled with eggs...but not scrambled then rolled, but baked. A few searches and I found I was not alone. Everyone from Martha Stewart wannabes to farmer housewives were tucking baked eggs into carefully folded crepes. A little ham and spinach and you had a whole meal. Just one little fork in the road (no pun intended) and that was...well the recipe called for over a dozen eggs. Goodness me. If I am going to consume that much cholesterol, at least let it be cage-free and organic. Am I right? So to Target we go!
From the looks of it, your letter actually came in right about the same time I went out of commission for a little while, so hopefully in the intervening time things have gotten a little better. From what Saurfang tells me, while he was minding the shop, he came by with a few thousand friends and did a fair bit of Twilight smacking, so hopefully that put a dent in the problem. Still, I know those cultists can be like roaches – no matter how many you kill, there always seems to be tons more of them. (And you know, you wouldn’t really expect there to be THAT many crazy despairing suicidal lunatics ready to sign on to help destroy the world, would you? I mean, even if you assume the cult has a frigging amazing recruiting division, would you really figure they’d be able to drum up thousands upon thousands of these people like they do? Kind of makes you wonder about the world’s collective parenting skills, that we’ve got THAT many people turning out THAT damaged.)

Mitchell is the smoocher. He loves nothing more than to cuddle and kiss. On a rough day (and who doesn't have those) he is the first one to come over and climb on my lap and tell me that he loves me. BUT don't get me wrong he is an equal opportunity cuddler and will happily give cuddles to the mums at school and even to strangers at times. He loves jarmie days and playing with his trains. He loves going out for coffee and spending time alone with either Kev or me. We call him Grandpa Simpson beecause he loves to tell stories which never seem to end or have much point to them. Mitchell is a blessing in our lives. He shows us daily that even when things are tough to do a positive attitude goes a very long way.
Current international legal thinking is also opposed to any legal "right to intervene" on at least three grounds: the Westphalia system of sovereignty and its associated norm of non-intervention has worked well for many years; the UN Charter is premised on the idea of non-intervention; and there is a fear that great states will use the practice for empire-building. To this, one might add the reluctance of some states to put their forces in harm's way for reasons other than national security. There is no settled law on the appropriate entrance and exit strategies with humanitarian intervention, and second-generation peacekeeping (or fourth-generation, asymmetric warfare) has not yet developed standing operating procedures. To some, the whole idea of humanitarian war is questionable because it would be dealing with criminals, not (wartime) enemies. As Pfaff (2005) puts it: enemies are capable of violating a state's rights; criminals are capable of violating individual rights. Military forces engaged in such operations would need to conduct themselves like law enforcement officials. Greater care would need to be taken on the use of force and protection of bystanders. Insurgents and terrorists could then easily exploit such limited action by using innocent civilians as human shields or proxy actors, and peacekeeping forces (i.e., soldiers as police) can only respond by being even more discriminating (among combatants and noncombatants) and concerned for the reciprocal levels of intimidation among the whole population, given that the latter presumably has a right to civic peace that the intervention (or intimidation) violates.
This was so helpful and completely changed how I approached the next draft. I altered the voice, and if I felt myself obsessing too much over the syntax or dialogue, I referred to my "themes" sheet and found myself getting back on track.
I used some images that I had purchased from Pink Petticoat a while back and followed the instructional video and was able to cut perfect circles around my image and then following this create perfect mats for them to be attached too. I had not used my images much before as I am rubbish with a craft knife and so being able to do this has opened so many possibilities to use my digital stamps and have them cut perfectly.

“We get tickled when the media refers to something being a ‘circus,’” said Byrd. “A circus is a very organized precise business.

There’s nothing erratic or crazy, except maybe what goes on in the ring.”
