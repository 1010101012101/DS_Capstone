Eventually after months of my face being naked, I realize I do like the way glasses make me look. As soon, that is, as I’m able to replace my ancient wire frames, which runs me about $450, or more than my first car.
It is not a static opposition, to be sure, but a historical one. It is eerily familiar, in truth. The first scene is that of enclosure, the privatizing by force of common lands that inaugurates the modern world of employers and employees, commodities and wages, blood and fire. The second scene is that of globalization, wherein every corner of the earth must be drawn into the dream of liberal democracy, open to all — in so far as every corner of the earth might thereby become another outpost of the market, hiring a few, dispossessing a few more, and assuring that commerce is equally available to each with sufficient coin in purse. The whole history of capitalist modernity in four months!
Yes..I'm pregnant! I'm 18 weeks pregnant now. I only found out in January coz I missed my period back then..if my calculation is correct, my baby is "Made in Jakarta"..LOL.
Is this about a social media policy? I don't think so. Is it about governance, engagement, conversation, accountability, structural consistency, clarity of mission, and a willingness to remain civil while participating in difficult areas of work riven with disagreement? Yes. Nonprofits are part of civil society which thrives only when it is filled with multiple points of view and diverse approaches to problem solving. The "public" will not agree with every decision a foundation or nonprofit makes and they have a right to express that disagreement. Foundations and nonprofits have a right (and a responsibility) to make their decisions and expect a public response to them.
And — and we have a bottom rate of 10 percent. I believe in a differential. I don’t believe in a flat tax. I believe in a simplified tax code with five deductions and — and focus on simplify, creating two rates.

Yesterday, for the first time during this pregnancy, I felt good. I felt really good. That beta number was so different from my last pregnancy’s beta number that I was sure it meant something different for this time around. I know I can still lose this pregnancy, but as long as it’s not to an ectopic, I think I’ll be okay.
However, it is not a United States of Europe. Countries retain their sovereignty in most areas, including taxation, and national governments continue to function . Areas where countries have agreed to pool sovereignty are administered by a supranational body called the Commission. Decision making and debate occurs in the Council of Ministers, with countries voting according to a formula based on size and population. The EU is continuing to evolve and to develop policies to meet the challenges its members face today. Its institutions badly need streamlining and overhauling, hence the Lisbon Treaty.
Yet what it boils down to in the end is that no matter what you do, what you take, how you live your life, there's a study out there saying that what you're doing is wrong. So my advice for what it's worth is live life the way you want too, you aren't getting out of it alive after all.

Still on the trail of Jane Austen and her niece, Anna Austen Lefroy I read that strange oddity, Jane Austen’s Sir Charles Grandison, and decided it’s not so odd after all. It’s a collaboration between niece and aunt; the ms resembles what we find in the other extant worked-over ms’s; it’s a sort of unfinished, first version play adaptation or sequel. As a ms this text tells the same tale of development from caricature as the other ms’s.
This atlas of the stars is based on telescopic observations and is considered 15 times more accurate than the best previous atlases. The coordinates of nearly 3,000 stars, charts and maps are beautifully illustrated by the artist Sir James Thornhill (1675 -1734). It was published and edited posthumously by Flamsteed’s widow, Margret and her assistants, first in 1729 then 1753 and finally in 1781. John Flamsteed (1646-1719) was the son of a prosperous merchant and maltster in Denby near Derby. He began to study astronomy between 1662 and 1669 on his own and opposed by his father. He was employed by King Charles II as Britain’s first Royal Astronomer on the 4th March, 1675, on the recommendation of Jonas Moore, a mathematician and patron of astronomy. The Royal Observatory at Greenwich was built for Flamsteed and he began observing in 1676, but he had to fund and bring his own instruments. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1677, where he was a Member of council from 1681-4 and 1698-1700. His earlier work Historia Coelestis Britannica was also not published complete until after his death, though a partial edition had been issued in 1712. The book is ‘Folio’ size (553x394mm) bound Cambridge style panelled calf, gilt spine with raised bands and a morocco title label.
Who wouldn’t want to have someone around who really knows them, who they can really talk to, and who is always improving their character and helping them to solve problems? The more you study what he is doing and learn things that can help him, the more he will want to have you around everywhere he goes. Every skill you get has potential for solving problems that you both may face when you start a family. It’s actually a very good idea to collect useful skills, make money and have a plan of your own. And I’ll explain why.
Anyway, I don't want to go too deep into this topic so I'll wrap it up there. If I wasn't living in the middle of nowhere just now I'd head out tomorrow dressed up as a kid in a costume in order to get myself some free sweets, as it is, I'll just go to the pub instead and pay for some real ale.

And finally, with five or fewer minutes to go, the promised discussion, which you have billed as the point of programme. The fashion guru says without elaboration that he doesn't go for Gothic stuff. The female comedian looks a bit uninterested in this, and fails to give an opinion of her own. Well, that's what it's like in book clubs, isn't it? No one's obliged to say anything, after all. Others make a few murmurs, and the general impression is that no one likes it very much. Well, that's how it goes: people in book clubs are so often far more interested in their own egos than books.

I've been very quiet over the last few weeks. It's mostly been because I've been trying to finish my thesis while packing and coordinating my move to Malaysia. Gosh. I can't believe my time here is up. After three and a half years in Christchurch, I'm finally moving back to my beloved hometown - Kota Kinabalu. Between the move, thesis-writing and the chaos at home, I haven't had any time for blogging or bloghopping. Believe me, I've been meaning to read the updates in my reading folder but circumstances just don't permit it.
We became vegetarians but as we learned about the horrors of the egg and dairy industries, it became clear that Veganism was the only way to go. What difference did it make to spare chickens bred for eating while continuing to eat eggs at the brutal expense of other chickens? Why refuse steak or burgers only to consume dairy which, in my opinion, causes the most cruel suffering of all? We quickly replaced dairy products with alternatives and within months, gave up eggs and became Vegan. While I do believe that every bit helps, I also see vegetarianism as a stepping stone towards a truly compassionate life.

I can't say enough good things about Flora ( our dinner spot) I love the food, the cocktails, and the vibe of the place.

Okay, on to your question. Yes, it's bad protocol to shop for an agent while you're under contract. Honestly, it's a breach of contract and puts all parties, including the agents you're talking to, in a very uncomfortable position. What if your agent happens to be best friends with one of the other agents you're talking to? How does it make you look to other agents if they know you're the kind of author who might go behind their backs when unhappy? That being said, it does happen all the time. While certainly some agents will feel "protocol be damned," others might tell you to get back in touch after your relationship has been dissolved.

I’d invite Bianca Lancia because she was supposed to be the only wife he really loved.
The venerable St. Johns Knits have stepped up their game with a new fall campaign featuring Kate Winslet. The Oscar winning actress recently told Women's Wear Daily, "They want to keep it looking like me and not have it look like me pretending to be a model wearing these clothes. I'm obviously not a model. I'm not the size of a model. I don't have the face of a model or the shape." I disagree as many women will totally identify with her curves. The line is definitely a more contemporary, youthful collection for St. Johns and looks fabulous.

Now comes a post from John Infante that looks at what might spring up as a result of three unrelated proposals being considered by the NCAA. They are:
Mike was born in 1950 in Philadelphia and was the eldest of six siblings. Growing up he was a quiet, sensitive, introverted child and a high achiever in both sports and in his academic studies. As a tall blonde teenager who happened to be on the school basketball team he never had any lack of either friends or girlfriends and when he achieved a scholarship to a good college it must have seemed like he had his future set. But within a couple of years Mike began to exhibit some strange behaviour and he was to spend most of his adult life heavily medicated and living in hospitals or care homes.
However what did strike me was the difference in ‘tone’ of the different phases of the event.

On the outside of another exit from Fraggle Rock, through a well, live a family of Gorgs, giant furry humanoids standing 22 feet tall. The husband and wife of the family call themselves the King and Queen of the Universe, with their son Junior as its Prince and their heir, but to all appearances working as simple farmers with a hut and garden patch. The Gorgs regard Fraggles as pests, which steal radishes from their garden. In one episode it is revealed that the Gorgs use radishes to make "anti-vanishing cream" that prevents them from becoming invisible. So the three main races of the Fraggle Rock universe — Fraggles, Doozers and Gorgs — are all dependent on the radishes for different reasons. While the King and Queen consider the Fraggles disgusting vermin, Junior enjoys chasing, catching and keeping them like a boy would lizards and bugs. Junior has no friends, and perhaps pursues the Fraggles just so he has someone to talk to.
Among the 500-or-so passengers was a 15-year-old boy by the name of Lionel Landberg. A mathematics prodigy of some note, he had recently won a scholarship to Oxford University, and his rather strict father had been persuaded to reward him for this achievement by taking him on a cruise. Lionel was unusual for a boy of his age in preferring the company of children younger than himself. Thus, he went about his business on ship followed by a platoon of diminutive flunkies, eager to absorb his precocious wisdom and chuckle at his sparkling wit. At the end of our first week at sea, Master Landberg had sought me out on the main deck, accompanied, as always, by his fresh-faced entourage.

“An Islamic term that is often misunderstood is jihad,” asserts Houghton Mifflin’s 2003 textbook “Across the Centuries.” “The term means ‘to struggle,’ to do one’s best to resist temptation and overcome evil. Under certain conditions, the struggle to overcome evil may require action. The Qur’an and Sunna allow self-defense and participation in military conflict, but restrict it to the right to defend against aggression and persecution.”

Enabling, in a negative sense, refers to actions which are intended to help a person with dysfunctional behavior, but in fact only serve to perpetuate the problem. For example, one attempts to “help” an alcoholic by buying them liquor, making excuses for them, or helping them hide their addiction.

Before my first psychiatric hospitalisation in 2007 I had only experienced RLS a couple of times. I didn't even know what it was then. But since I was first admitted to hospital for depression and drug and alcohol abuse (which is a huge story in itself) I was given a massive cocktail of psychiatric drugs that set my hips twitching and they haven't stopped since.

What I enjoyed most about this book is that it’s based on reality without all the cynicism that seems to prevail in popular children’s books today. (I’ve stated many times that I’m not fond of the recent trend in literature whose hero/heroine is a jaded adolescent who prides themselves on being disrespectful to their elders.) Furthermore, this book is more than your typical coming of age book. It also teaches a little about history. Since it takes place in 1963, we learned about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, astronauts landing on the moon and the dawning of feminism.
I’ve always written for both print and broadcast and I wrote a script called ‘Merry Meet’ while on the MA in TV Scriptwriting course at Leicester DeMontfort University. Merry Meet was the pilot for a one hour TV show about an ex-witch trying to lead a normal life without magic. The script was selected by the Screenwriters Festival as one of the scripts they wanted to promote that year. They arranged for it to have a professional script reading and I was presented with a script report on my work.
This realism is particularly poignant because the cast of characters are at such extremes of reality that would be caricatures in any other treatment. But here they have a steady pulse and presence; not necessarily jumping out at the viewer, but remaining part of the overarching experience of humanity. Within one apartment complex there is the man who exercise only one side of his body, the silent bookish observer, the woman who takes in animals and attracts butterflies, the group of long-haired smokers who occasionally discuss serious things, and the spectacled film critic who understands stories.
November 29 Denver, CO Ogden Theatre
I had a little New Year's resolution, the same one that so many of us have each year. I wanted to lose some weight. I'd been trying rather unsuccessfully for months and it was yet another thing that I was sad and upset about. It's rather obvious to me now that I had been thinking about Dd again and what our next steps might be. Aside from the odd swats when I really frustrated him, we hadn't talked about or acted on it in years. In merely days since our above conversation my husband had become attentive again, but he was still very passive/aggressive and I was still very controlling. The push and pull for power on a daily basis was just ridiculous. I almost always won...and it made me miserable.
I had no idea what to expect from Foer. I hadn’t watched any youtube videos of him. Besides reading Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, I’d only read one article on him that Logan sent me and heard from a friend who once met him that he is a pretentious jerk (I took that last comment with a grain of salt because a lot of great people give terrible first impressions). He is more attractive and slighter of frame in person than he appears in the picture I posted last week. His talk was more humorous than I was expecting though also meaningful.
Every murderer admits that only their first murder was a challenge, but once they had crossed that obstacle of the initial murder, it is easy to kill again and again and again. Not one single member of the ANC ever admitted to their crimes against humanity as a terrorist organisation. They were never expected to say they were sorry for any of their murders and vicious cowardly terrorist acts and they never did say they were sorry, because they never had any remorse, not even the messiah of the liberal world, Nelson Mandela himself.

Everything that has been created by God reflects His glory in some form.Creation reveals our Creator’s glory. This is seen in the smallest microscopic form of life to the vast milky way from the sunsets and the stars to the storms and seasons.

I used the Viva Las Vegastamps! rubber stamp (Two Toucans On Branch-Item 8829 Plate 695) in my Rhodia dotWebbie journal, colored up with Tim Holtz Distress markers. I only had 5 colors at that time, so I used a Pentel white sunburst gel pen to soften and widen my range. The patterns were drawn with a handmade pen that uses a Bic ballpoint tip. For some reason, this drawing makes me think of an embroidered piece of cloth, so I call it Faux Embroidery.

He looked to me and his eyes swam around for a moment and then the somewhat enibriated yet genuine affection and pride in his eyes. He hugged me. I can still smell him–right now as I write this, and I want to cry. “I love yous, I love yous” just like he always used to say. His voice was soft and sweet, like a hushing mama bear. He told me my and my sisters profiles–where we were currently working, what we did, how we did in school, what city we lived in. I didn’t ask how he knew. But again I wasn’t surprised by this knowledge. I was surprised by the fact that someone in this world wanted to know about our lives, and it seemed to be the only facts he cared about above anything else. My heart ached. He bought me a beer. Coors Light. I drank it because it smelled like my childhood with him, and how Grandpa Leo used to sit us on his torn black leather recliner and give his toddler grandchildren sips of Old Style. I can still taste that too. Funny how fragments of your earliest years are so strong in your senses.
God made each of us unique. Our calling, our gifting, our talents and our opportunities are all different. When we put on someone else's shoes, no amount of envy, cajoling or faking will move us forward the way we were meant to move forward.

A canvas shoe organizer. The canvas variety does not allow the pocket contents to be as visible as clear, plastic versions - but it does "hide messiness" better. And it makes everything look a bit more uniform. Plus, I think the canvas ones hold up a bit better, and can easily be spot cleaned.

Illustrated picture books are an essential part of growing up. Before words have any significance in a child’s life pictures are everywhere and everything. From ‘reading’ their mom’s face minutes after birth to curling up on the sofa bed with dad to read a favorite book, pictures and images are an essential form of communication and central to children’s understanding of their world.

I agree with Lynn who said the solution to this dilemma is to respect the Muslim group’s right to build its center on private property using private funds even if we may not like it or believe it to be disrespectful and insensitive. There is nothing legally we can do to stand in their way. But to try to bribe them away with government land is illegal, and a direct violation of Separation of Church and State.

My stepfather was a good example of the 'split soul theory.' In the house, amongst 'civilization' he basically never spoke to me - no communication or sharing at all, except when I did something wrong of course. In nature, he was a different person - a completely different person. Although his 'teaching' methods were a bit 'unconventional' - he taught me a lot and I had no choice, but to learn hard and fast. This was always the way in Africa - no time to fool around. I think in Nature - his soul had time to catch up with his body.

This is a rather astounding brief account of Napoleon’s life. But that’s not all. In 1550, another doctor and astrologist, living in Salon-de-Provence, the famous Nostradamus, writes about him in his Centuries.

Religious difference plays very little role in this film’s plot. Segel has said that some of the religion material ended up on the cutting-room floor. I like to imagine that by minimizing religion as a source of conflict, Segel, as an adult interfaith child, is making a positive statement about the possibilities of interfaith love.

Bryce and I decided that we wanted to stay in and cook dinner together rather than going out. For me personally, going out to a fancy restaurant surrounded by other couples celebrating Valentine's Day, takes away from a bit of the romance and intimacy of the holiday, so I was glad to be staying home. When I arrived at Bryce's he had the table set up!

For most, Halloween is a really fun holiday that all kids look forward to. For kids with food allergies and their parents, there is a nerve wrecking side to it - the candy that the kids receive door to door can lead to severe or even fatal allergic reactions in kids who are allergic to peanuts or some of the other major food allergens. In my case, we do not know the full extent of my son's peanut allergy, as he has yet to eat anything with peanuts or tree nuts in it. We know we can have it in the house (we still eat peanut butter on occasion) and for many children, even being around peanut products can cause a reaction.

As a general rule, the offers you complete through Project Payday’s forum will pay more if they require you to make a payment upfront, and the more they cost you the better they will pay. You have to figure out for yourself how much a certain offer will cost and decide whether it is worth the amount you will get paid for the time it will take you.

Why It Worked: The Rock Bottom IPA is one of the grapefruit variety. Inspiration from the pairing came from the basic coupling of English IPA and Fish and Chips, but much like the American IPA has grown far beyond its roots, the "fish and chips" of this dish had evolved from their English roots. The salted cod was made in house and was prepared with potatoes and other ingredients to make something that resembled a crab cake. The chips were transformed into a fennel and apple slaw, dressed with a mustard vinaigrette and Belgian ale foam. The citrus flavors of the IPA were a friendly and familiar pairing with the cod, while the spicy mustard vinaigrette developed added complexity from the bitterness of the beer. The big acidic hop presence helped prevent the salted cod from being too salty.

I know what you’re thinking . . . branding is for big, international companies like Tide, Chevrolet and Target. That’s not the case in today’s world. Small business, non-profits and even individuals use branding as a way to give the company and organization a personality, a persona. It’s a way to give your small business a human characteristic so that consumers can better relate to the company.
How much morality is there in saving an Ethiopian child from starvation today, for it to survive to a life of brutal circumcision, poverty, hunger, violence and sexual abuse, resulting in another half-dozen such wide-eyed children, with comparably jolly little lives ahead of them? Of course, it might make you feel better, which is a prime reason for so much charity. But that is not good enough.

Conversely, creating fictional places pushes the story away from reality. The psychological realism of Crime and Punishment, and our visceral reaction to it, might be broken if we know that such and such a place doesn't really exist, reminding us, by proxy, that neither do these characters or actions.

I have a confession to make: schedules and I have a pretty strong love-hate relationship. The ease of having plans and knowing what’s going on, conflicts with my forgetful brain and desire to be spontaneous. Scheduling meetings is a hassle; especially when you know you have to write it on at least five sticky notes and scatter them around your room just to remember it. And with an already packed schedule (due to this thing called school), it’s nearly impossible to find a time to meet with a group of people. So what’s a girl like me to do?

“The days are coming,” declares the Sovereign Lord, “when I will send a famine through the land—not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord. Men will stagger from sea to sea, and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the Lord, but they will not find it.” (Amos 8:11-12)

However, to be honest, I'm not the kind of person who has very well-defined goals. I've always drifted through life... a life peppered with passing obsessions that eventually move along to give way to the next new flirtation. I look upon the people who know what they want - really know what they want, with an all-consuming passion and drive - and I often catch myself envying them.
I used the flower in circle on page 16 of the handbook. I separated the layers and used the base, double flowers, and single flower pieces. I set my default border to a 2 and selected the color white as the default. This gives me a closer cut than the standard 0.4.

This is the same logic that has been used to justify genetically engineered (GE) food crops, and then fiber crops such as cotton and trees, and finally crops that produce pharmaceuticals. Each introduction was always a step forward for human comfort and well-being. Now, we have weeds which resist the herbicide that only a decade ago was supposed to be the great savior of the cash crop farmer by reducing the chemical, labor and financial inputs of those who planted crops that resisted the same herbicide. That herbicide known as glyphosate may now be altering the microflora in the soil in a way that leads to so-called "sudden death" of GE crops.

It seemed so unnecessary, but we still had a chance, if only we could keep away from the crowd and the suction of the sinking ship.

I became so aware, after having this week with them, that we have such a cosy feeling between us. We know each other so well as we have spent so much time together in our lives. We have been together since their birth and we have gone through quite some things, ups and downs, from peak experiences to the boring day-to-day life. The bond between us in incredible – there’s so much trust and closeness, connection and love.

Sammy had told me I’d be speaking soon. Right around midnight he introduced me. I was amazed that a couple hundred people were willing to stay up so late on a Friday night. I’ve been asking the Lord to speak to me more through the Gift of “words of knowledge” – one of the nine gifts that I’m convinced we don’t see enough practical execution of in the body today. He was kind and through-out the day I would have random thoughts/words/feelings come to me that I would make a quick note of. They ranged from “tightness/arthritis of the knees” to “young boy diagnosed with ADHD suffering from learning disorders” and many in-between. I prayed for a while, shared a bit from Hebrews 12 and read the words I felt God had given me. There is no way to express the gifts of the Spirit without taking a risk. The risk is that I might be wrong. I may not have heard from God at all. Maybe I just made it all up? Despite the downfall, it’s worth the risk to see someone’s face brighten with the reality that God KNOWS their personal circumstance and wants to intervene. I had those stand who believed the words were directly aimed at them and/or were loosely relate-able. I’ve seen this happen on several occasions now. About 30+ rose to their feet. I asked everyone to gather around them, lay hands, and we spent a little time praying. Everyone who either wasn’t healed/restored/moved by God (or whom I hadn’t given a specific word to) was invited to receive more prayer in a very cold, but accommodating, side-room at the back of the church. We had a wonderful time and were able to pray with many who received instant healing or a relieving of emotional/spiritual weights. A grandmother brought us her grandson who was 9 or 10 – diagnosed with ADHD and suffered from learning disorders! I mean, at a normal church meeting of 200, the odds might be higher. But at a prayer meeting at midnight??? Ha, Thank you Father for the way You still naturally supernaturally speak to us.
At 8.5 months old, we have been waiting for one to pop through for months. Over the past couple of weeks he has been more fussy and acting a little out of the norm for our chill man.

The assumption that having more obvious autistic traits and abilities is bad (“more severe”) has resulted in prejudicial judgments in the literature. An autistic boy (who has accomplished more as a child and young adult than most people, autistic or otherwise) with a full-scale IQ of more than 100 and a strong performance on numerous tests is judged to be “low-functioning,” because he is so obviously atypical. That is, he is judged to be very “severely” autistic (Bonneh et al., 2008; Belmonte et al., 2009), and this must solely be a very bad thing. In Aldred et al. (2004), preschool autistic children are falsely judged to be “low-functioning” or “high-functioning” solely on the basis of presumed autism “severity” falsely drawn from ADOS scores. It is being falsely and prejudicially assumed that an autistic whose traits and abilities are more obvious must function poorly.

Perhaps it is easy to succumb to the temptation that we live in a hopeless, cynical age. Countries are torn apart by political scandals, intrigue, and partisan politics. Sports heroes get caught up in doping scandals and acts of violence. Hardly a day goes by without an accusation against some prominent business figure. The authority of the Catholic Church has been squandered by mishandling of sex abuse cases and an inconsistent application of its prophetic stance to stand up for the dignity of every human life.

Like that state’s noxious and contested immigration law, the move cannot be read as anything but a blatantly anti-Latino move. Unlike SB 1070, however, this ruling doesn’t bother to disguise its prejudice with the excuse of illegal entry or unauthorized residence. No, this move simply seeks to make sure Latino students, citizen and non-citizen alike, don’t get too uppity.

The fact that a person can also buy or sell by using the name of the beast or the number of the beast shows that people do not obtain the Mark of the Beast so that they buy or sell. The Mark of the Beast’s main purpose is to serve as a way for people to prove that their allegiances are with Antichrist. In other words, accepting the Mark of the Beast means that you have declared yourself a follower of the Antichrist and thereby an opponent of God.

I am not a fan of prologues. Some writers have the appalling habit of augmenting a poor beginning with a prologue that is not really a prologue but a more of an interlogue, a section taken from the middle of the book. While this might create suspense and keep us reading through a less than stellar beginning, it is not really necessary to the story since the material is a duplication, and we feel duped when we reread it during the course of the book.

“You think this is just another day in your life. It’s not just another day — it’s the one day that is given to you, today. It’s given to you, it’s a gift. It’s the only gift that you have right now, and the only appropriate response is gratefulness. If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is, if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life, and the very last day, then you would have spent this day very well.”

Last Christmas I FINALLY got my hands on a Kindle (HURRAH!). It took a while, I had the usual inner bookworm battle that I now see friends and colleagues having about whether it’s an insult to book lovers to move to the Kindle – How often do I hear repetitive choruses of “it’s not the same” “I love real books too much” “I need to feel the pages”. It’s hillarious. I love “real” books too, and I love reading, and now I get to do it more and I’m not limited by where I am or what I’m carrying. The Kindle IS truly amazing, and I am a fully fledged evangalist on the matter. Thanks to the Kindle, I can now:

"She got mixed up with the wrong people, started down this path that I couldn't talk her out of, and now she's gone." Witnesses, meanwhile, were astonished by the ease with which the Widow dispatched all of the supernatural beings who tried to attack her. "It was like she wasn't even trying," one witness told

I do feel a little sorry for you. Why don't we bury the hatchet until the next Cup rolls around (or at least the Olympics, which I'm sure you probably slobber over in equal measure). Come on, let's get together, talk it out, have a beer. Maybe play a drinking game? I heard of a great one! It's called "World Cup". You sit around for 90 minutes plus some mysterious amount of time that gets magically added to the 90 minutes, and stare intently at each other while blasting a boombox of farting plastic horns on a loop. In that time, maybe somebody takes a drink. Or maybe they don't! Maybe it's nil-nil, and nobody wins. Doesn't that sound like fun? No? What are you, a Luddite?

The film proceeds from there to show Caden taking this last bit rather too much to heart. Awarded a Macarthur Genius grant, Caden moves to a new theater -- a massive one -- and brings together an enormous cast and crew to stage what will eventually turn out to be Caden's own life, every part of it, parts being rehearsed (which is the other thing, the play is in a perpetual state of rehearsal) the day after the real events happened. But of course Synecdoche, New York is miles stranger than that. It's a film that includes things like one character, Hazel, purchasing a house that is always at least a little bit on fire (not my favorite bit of the film); or, after Adele has taken Olive to live in Germany without Caden, Caden finding his four-year-old daughter's diary, which at first is filled with adorable four-year-old girl things, but continues on, as the film does, through the years to contain all of Olive's experiences as she grows older (this was one of my favorite bits, clever and sad and endlessly rewarding); or Caden turning his stage into basically an exact copy of the city where he lives, with full buildings and streets, and nothing open to the audience (non-existent anyway) because to have buildings with open walls would be fake. And this last is really, finally, what the film is, structurally, or what it will ultimately become, as Caden's rigorous pursuit of the "real" and the "tough" results in various Cadens (one most prominently played by Tom Noonan) and Hazels (another played by Emily Watson) and maybe two Claires, as Caden must not only portray, say, a domestic scene, but now he must portray his attempt to portray that domestic scene. And all of this proceeding at the same pace as life, rehearsing on into old age.
Well I hope to get pictures taken and some posts up soon of the 2011
The Everything Kit bundles 4 of her best-selling kits (31 documents) - The Busy Mama Kit, The Cleaning Kit, The Vertical Weekly Docket, The Meal Planning Kit, and the Christmas Planning Kit (the Christmas Planning Kit can be switched out for any other kit with 5 or less documents). This kit is perfect for someone just getting a homekeeping notebook started.
Without waiting for either of them, I tramp down the hill and hope to God I don’t step in a pothole or trip over a wayward root. The shadows up here at night are thicker than puddles of spilled ink. Maybe I should have asked Sam for his flashlight.
I am also a Black woman living in the United States, which means that I am more than aware of prejudice and what it can turn someone into. I have had that unreasoning hatred directed at me many times in my life. I don’t like how it feels, and I try very hard not to make others feel that way.
And I think you are reading Sir Alyque Padamsee Sir’s latest article? (I am always admiring his advertisings.) He has told that, speaking from physics perspective, white people are reflecting light, so you can see them easily, but with dark people you always need light to see them. One joke here, we are actually calling dark people ‘IaS’, means ‘Invisible after Sunset’. I think Padamsee sir was not knowing this old joke, otherwise he could have used it in his advertisement. See, that’s why there is that famous painting in Mysore palace called ‘Lady with the Lamp’. She is a black beauty, the lady, and she is needing to be carrying oil lamp. On other hand, see my cousins Sarala and Tarala. They are both having big nose, and one-type of smiles. But because they are fair like tubelights, they are famous beauties of our family.

The Lucky Lab was a success from the start. Locals were immediately supportive and it remains a model for a neighborhood pub. In the years since it opened, the Lucky Lab has become one of Oregon’s largest brewpubs, brewing around 1,200 barrels of beer each year. Along with the McMenamins and BridgePort, where Geist and Stiles once worked, the Lucky Lab has become one of Portland’s signature brewpubs.
This tasty French spread can be used with grilled chicken or fish, vegetables, fruit, salads or slathered on crackers. I've been enjoying it with toast, pears and blue cheese. There are many versions of tapenade depending on where it's made, but it always contains olives, usually black, sometimes green.
Undaunted, we venture forth and, feeling slightly self-conscious, enter the Italian restaurant that, according to the desk clerk, looks-but-isn’t-fancy.

Hiro-san explained that fish, like beef, should be aged and left for 2-3 days for the flavours to develop before consuming. Unless the fish in question is alive, then like the Botan Ebi (spot prawn) that Hiro-san killed in front of us – holding tightly onto the wriggling prawns he cuts the heads off with one swift motion. The body is cut and cupped onto the rice, then the brain matter is mixed with soy and brushed over the flesh. Sweet and velvety, I did feel bad for the recently murdered crustacean but it sure was tasty!

Illegal immigration looks a little different in Washington D.C. where Hispanic votes are especially important to those who divide the electorate into voting groups; and in Arizona where illegal immigration is rife and the drug war just across the border is killing citizens.

The funny thing about faith and trust is that once it's broken, it's unimaginably difficult to put back together again. It's like unbending a paper clip, or stretching out a Slinky - sure, you can bend it back into a shape that loosely resembles what it once was, but it will never be the same again. And it will never work the way it did before.
And a shout-out to all my Cali friends who came out to class and Bobbi who flew in from Hawaii to see me…I loved spending time with you all and I enjoyed the classes with you & hope you did too. And special thanks to Shell for hosting me, I love ya and if you are in San Jose go visit her shop at ScrapGrlz. Also to my wonderful friend Patricia (The Paper Temptress) for spending time with us…it was super fun! And to Irina Blount (La La Land) for having dinner with us…as always it’s a blast to spend time with you when we ARE NOT working LOL!

Columnist Dr. Sajed Al-Abdali wrote about the project and spoke in the lecture saying this project will offer 2 to 6 for each 10,000 non-Kuwaitis. He wondered why isn’t the money of this project injected into reforming health services. Salma Al-Essa, from Kuwait’s association of transparency, assured the racist nature of this project. She also asked why isn’t the report of World Bank regarding this project still not published, if it exists, and added that there are no guarantees that the project will function well especially that it will not be
4) I want a presidential candidate with real solutions, not simply hateful rhetoric. It's easy to spout off about problems and not have any concrete solutions to problems. She's not wrong in stating that we have problems here. But everyone and anyone can do that. Someone who aspires to be president has to have solutions though.

My boys have been sick. some gastro stuff going around and some viral sore throat going around. so the middle boy, Uncle Football, is in college. Very hard to make him a dr's appointment here at home. He's only 45 minutes away but with his class schedule, it gets difficult. Well, I found a Walgreens near him that has a "take care clinic" inside. You see a nurse practitioner. cost me our co-pay and a prescription...didn't have to wait a long time...and it was SO much easier than doing the whole doctor thing. I wish we had one of those near us. :(
In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the broth, the 1/2 tsp. salt and several grinds of pepper and bring to a boil. Place the couscous in a large stainless-steel bowl and pour the hot liquid over it. Blend well with a fork, cover with a plate and let stand for 5 minutes.
Man, what a fun trip, for every member of my family. I am so very relaxed. (And yes, tired, and fat, and mildly hung over.) I would like to go on record as saying that, as long as my winter home in Bora Bora is still in the planning stages, I hope that we do this every year.
Tomorrow, well known Australia artist Colley Whisson will teach a 3-day workshop here in Austin. As the workshop organizer, I will be busy assisting him. I am really looking forward to see his techniques.
Like many others before him, Abbott discovers, once married, that marriage is a battle - clinically, a negotiation - over possession of the Bad Mood. A marriage, especially a marriage with children, cannot function properly if both its constituents are in a foul temper, thus the Bad Mood is a privilege only one spouse can enjoy at a time. Who gets to be in a Bad Mood? This is the day-to-day struggle. In the Perfect Union, the Bad Mood is traded equitably, like child care or household chores. There is joint custody of the Bad Mood...In a typical marriage, however, one spouse tends to possess the Bad Mood disproportionately. This is called Hogging The Mood.
And we both tried to put the flames out.

It’s hard to do, I know. It’s easier to stay in bed longer and then act crappy till you get the first sip of coffee. It is not fair to act crappy and mean in the morning, because it’s the morning. The thing is, it’s the morning, we know it’s hard for people, but it’s not an excuse to act all mean. Bitter morning people, turn into bitter afternoon people, which turn into bitter night people, because it’s okay to be moody in the morning.
The next verse limits the saved ones only to those who believe. “For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.” All have the possibility to receive the good news but only those who believe will enjoy the good cheer.

A hundred and sixty something pages in, I can say that I find Doris Lessing comforting because she makes me feel less alone. (This should be used as a watermark for every kind of reading experience, I think.) It feels good to read about a woman who struggles to find a symmetry and balance to her various lives: romantic, political, creative, emotional. I want to stick to my statement that the book isn’t exclusive to the female experience. However, I do love the book because it isn’t rally a bildungsroman, but about how a woman continues to develop after coming of age, after acquiring insight and savvy and a sense of self, as well as a healthy dose of skepticism towards everything. This is the period I am in now. A book is so much easier to project oneself upon than another person with the same problems. Other living people mean one’s problems aren’t exclusive anymore, and this makes one feel non-special and probably unhopeful.
Creating boundaries is a good way to keep your relationship healthy and secure. By setting boundaries together, you can both have a deeper understanding of the type of relationship that you and your partner want. Boundaries are not meant to make you feel trapped or like you’re “walking on eggshells.” Creating boundaries is not a sign of secrecy or distrust — it’s an expression of what makes you feel comfortable and what you would like or not like to happen within the relationship. Remember, healthy boundaries shouldn’t restrict your ability to:
I’ve seen this film once before but as I really enjoyed it the first time I decided to re-watch it. The film is done in a biographical drama style highlighting the amazing survival story of Aron Ralston (played by James Franco) who became trapped by a boulder in a deep canyon in Robbers Roost in Utah. One of the main issues was that he didn’t tell anyone where he was going !
Top speed for Puma is 87 kilometers an hour, and cruising speed is 37-50 kilometers an hour. Max altitude is 3,800 meters (12,500 feet), and the UAV can stay in the air for 120 minutes at a time. Puma has a better vidcam (providing tilt, pan and zoom) than the smaller Raven, and that provides steadier and more detailed pictures. Because it is larger than Raven, and three times as heavy, Puma is much steadier in bad weather. The Raven only stays in the air for 80 minutes. Both Puma and Raven are battery powered.

I agree. When I was in the throes of unschooling when my kids were little, I made sure I worked on my own interests. I always took a course- whether it was photography or 'word' or singing. I called it taking care of my mental health. I volunteered a lot (and my kids came along with me) and created a group against the use of pesticides for cosmetic use. I produced a weekly radio show (for free), I wrote for little pay or for nothing- but that helped build up my resume and gave me confidence to move forward when the time came to seek employment.

First up, blue striped curtains that are currently in the room, orange lamp, the dvd cover art, and two large scale, blown-up photos of the boys.

I have twice ventured to Cornwall since Christmas in the hope of seeing Scarlett: both times she was unattainable. I think maybe I will never see her again. It’s not a problem. I guess when I’m stressed I go off at tangents regularly. Imagine my fortitude, irony, when I walked into the disappointment that was St. Mawes. I travelled 900 miles round trip just to be out of pocket and frankly a bit lost. What direction do I go in now? I’d love to just find somewhere that didn’t just abuse me in someway. How did sailors cope in the past sleeping in those cramped smelly quarters?

In discernment counseling, Dr. Doherty helps the leaning-out spouse decide if the decision to leave the marriage is the correct one. And he helps the leaning-in spouse cope in a way that doesn’t make the situation worse—without pleading, threatening or otherwise turning off the already irritated spouse. Over five sessions, Dr. Doherty has the couple examine what was good about the marriage, what got them to this point and what they did to try and save the marriage. He lays out three alternatives: marriage as it has been, divorce, or a six-month reconciliation with marriage therapy. Of the 25 couples Dr. Doherty counseled, 40% decided to try the reconciliation; the rest divorced or are thinking it over.
I mentioned earlier that the control we exert over our children can work in the short term. It may take effort, and we need to have the stomach for the inevitable conflicts, at least until our kids wear down and stop fighting. We can control bedtimes, and behavior, and school performance, and participation in various activities. Sometimes, we can do this with relative ease, especially if the child actually enjoys these activities. More often, it is not easy and sets up an adversarial relationship between parent and child that can last a lifetime. But it can be done, in the short term.

For 2011, I've decided to change tack a little. Instead of shoving obscurities in your face like so many mince pies, I've created a Spotify Playlist of established Christmas songs with a few ones thrown in which, on the surface, appear to have nothing to do with the season whatsoever. This might seem like a ridiculous thing to do, but these are all tracks I regularly dig out for my own listening pleasure over Yuletide, purely because something about them - perhaps the time of the year they were originally released, the clanging bells in the mix, the Spector-ish wall of sound, the wintery feel - feels indicative of the season to me. This means that Pulp's "Bad Cover Version", Johnny Boy's "You Are The Generation That Bought More Shoes and You Get What You Deserve", The Jackpot's "Tiny Goddess" and the Dukes of Stratosphear's "Pale and Precious" sit alongside Slade, Jona Lewie and Greg Lake.
When you do a lot of things and your boss does not appreciate you, do you feel bad? But your boss is treating you exactly how you treat yourself. You are a person who does so many things all at once sitting on a place and yet you don’t appreciate yourself? Now that’s really bad of you.

Seriously, I get one or two letters a week people. And most recently, I got a letter from a hospital thanking her for choosing that location and blah blah blah. Doesn't she care that she's not getting her mail? Apparently not, but being the conspiracy theorist that I am, I choose to believe she's doing something shady. So I emailed BCBS today and told them that I want it changed ASAP because I feel like something no-quite-right is going on, and I don't want my address to be a part of it. For some reason, it bugs the shit out of me that she hasn't changed her information on her insurance. It bugs me a lot. More than it should.

More thoughts on River Song. Bishop Octavian reveals that River was in prison because she killed a man. A good man, we are told, a hero to many. The implication is that this good man is The Doctor. But Octavian has, though-out both this episode and the previous, constantly asked River if The Doctor can be trusted or is he just a madman. Octavian seems to have no knowledge of who The Doctor is. So, either Octavian was giving hints to The Doctor and building him up, or it really isn’t The Doctor that River kills. Regardless, the final scene between The Doctor and Octavian is touching and reveals Octavian to be a great and noble character.

She says the “NOOOOOO!” in a way that makes it sound as if being a Kao is a crime punishable by death. I repeat to her that I am a pure Kao, but she puts it to me categorically that I should investigate my ancestry keenly.

· Silicone manufacturers can withstand varying temperatures. Perfect for storing food in the freezer and equally perfect for cooking in the oven, Silicone outshines other materials by absorbing the shock of varying temperatures without any physical damage. Where other materials may warp or deform when subjected to excessive temperature change, silicone does not. As the non-stick element is not simply a coating, it is impossible to flake of as with some cheaper metal cookware and bakeware items. This negates the need for using multiple products to prepare, store and cook – saving you money, cleanup time and storage space.

With holiday entertaining in mind, this entree would be lovely at a dinner party, allowing the hostess / chef to actually visit with guests because such little time is spent in the kitchen!

"Siting there in the sun at Hampstead, in the late summer, under the south wall and the ripened peaches, doing nothing with her hands, she remembered the day she had become engaged to Henry. She had plenty of leisure now, day in, day out, to survey her life as a tract of country traversed, and at last become a landscape instead of separate fields or separate years and days, so that it became a unity and she could see the whole view, and could even pick out a particular field and wander round it again in spirit, though seeing it all the while as it were from a height, fallen into its proper place, with the exact pattern drawn round it by the hedge, and the next field into which the gap in the hedge would lead. So, she thought, could she at last put circles round her life. Slowly she crossed that day, as one crosses a field by a little path through the grasses, with the sorrel and the buttercups waving on either side; she crossed it again slowly, from breakfast to bed-time, and each hour, as one hand of the clock passed over the other, regained for her its separate character: this was the hour, she thought, when I first came downstairs that day, swinging my hat by its ribbons; and this was the hour when he persuaded me into the garden, and sat with me on the seat beside the lake, and told me it was not true that with one blow of its wing a swan could break the leg of a man.

Alright, though. Most of these people are generally ok, and I don’t really have strong feeling for them either way. That could easily change if I bumbed into them while having lunch and then had a proper conversation with them. Until then, I don’t feel the need to pay that much attention to them. I’ll say hi and I’ll be polite. That’s enough if I don’t feel like more.
The pupils we met were uniformly great. Enthusiastic, informed, thoughtful, kindly ambassadors, well aware of their good fortune. Well educated. And its not that we don't believe in excellence. But some schools seemed so aware they were grooming for excellence that if your - the child's - vision of what you might want from life differed from theirs, and they thought you could get them brownie points, an Oxbridge place maybe, well it would be hard to stand out against it. Conformity. We know best. And I'm sure, in many things, they did.

Betty and I arrived at the hospital and got to spend some time with my mom, my grandma Beulah, Betty’s mom, Pastor Dutton, and Pastor Gray. I was admitted and went back to get prepped for the procedure. We were blessed because Janice Dupree (someone from our church who I didn’t even really know) had called in after seeing my name in the Faith Prayer email and asked a certain nurse (Brooke) to take care of me. Brooke was absolutely a Godsend, she literally spent the entire day with me – from nearly 8am till when we left at around 9pm.

I asked Brooke to take a sharpie and write all over my body to sedate me fully because I didn’t want to be awake.

Moses Atwood set sail with sophomore album “One Bright Boat” on March 30, 2012. The album was produced at Waking Studio, the new digs of Bill Moriarty (Dr. Dog) in Philadelphia. Running like a current through the record is Atwood’s talent for telling a story in fleeting images and washes of sound. These aren’t ballads but modern song-sketches of places longed for and passed through, people met and parted with, time passing. His music has been compared to Van Morrison and Randy Newman.

There are lots of parallels in the book, not to mention the impending flooding of the city: There are no less than 4 young girls at the margins of society, three of them practically feral children and the fourth (Rafferty's half sister) raised, it seems, in a Chinese gang. There are parents struggling to protect their children (Poke and his wife having adopted a street child, as well as rescuing another young woman from the streets to take care of their policeman friend after his wife dies, plus Murphy's damaged daughter whose sociopathic, nearly feral tendencies have been developed rather than suppressed by her father, and refugees still suffering from war crimes.
You used to be such a free-spirited kid, always running around, tormenting the hunchbacked neighbor working in his garden, falling out of trees, and riding bikes until the streetlights came on.
The orchestra moved out to a place called Camp Joan Myer, a camp for the blind, located at the northern part of the city of Malibu. It is set on a hill overlooking the ocean. It was there that I really began to question the guru and the meditation. I was with another member of the orchestra and we were both having difficulty believing the so-called party line. He stated that if you were told you were a god from the time you were a baby, what would you believe? I nodded and a few months later I left. However, while I was there we had a mahatma of great importance visit us. I watched this man perform occult, demonic “miracles.” Here’s what I mean:

Now there are some obvious problems with the RCP map right now. For one it’s based on a majority of Registered Voter Polls not Likely Voter Polls. For those who don’t know Registered Voter Polls are almost always off from Likely Voter Polls (and 9 times out of 10 the likely voters are 2-3 points more in favor of the Republican than the registered voters). Then there is the problem that when I do have likely voter polls it’s pretty much only one poll and I will admit that the more polls the better (which is why RCP is so good once all the major polls switch to likely voter pools)…but you have to make due with what you have. And then there is the fact that there several of these polls that I am working with were taken before Santorum dropped out (give a 1-2 point boost to Romney post that) and he’ll probably get a small boost once Gingrich officially drops out (1 point maybe…which seems small…but a point can make all the difference…)

I guess I didn't really care for Zombie 4: After Death. It never made a whole lot of sense, the effects were bad, the acting was lousy, the zombies weren't all that scary, the only part that had me concerned was when the little girl who played the very young Jenny was running through the jungle and kept losing her balance - I thought the poor thing was going to hurt herself, and the most frightening thing in the whole movie were the teeth on actor Nick Nicholson. Kids, seriously: brush after every meal.
Delicate arching branches of pale pink blossoms contrast against the grey flotilla of Japanese-Canadian fishing boats in the mural. During the latter part of the 19th century and up to World War II, the Japanese immigrants were formative in sustaining the fishing and canning industries along the southern coast of British Columbia. However, the dark spot in history was the confiscation of their fishing boats and their possessions by the Canadian government in 1939 and thereafter, with the Japanese Allied bombing of Pearl Harbour in Hawaii.
The album is on Polydor, and has an orange label, rather than the classic red. Interestingly, whilst the writing on Side 1′s label is white, it’s actually black on orange for Side 2. The tape is a BASF chrome, but even though the shell has standard Type I spec, it does show evidence of high bias notches next to the write protect tabs. The notches are blocked in to preserve the Type I auto-setting, but it’s clear the shell is adapted from Type II spec.
In 1979, Pope John-Paul II attempted to pardon Galileo, but the irreparable damage to the Church’s reputation to describe the workings of the Universe had been done, centuries earlier.
JAS: Hmmm. I think you're underestimating the crazy that's coming your way; I'm especially conscious of this right now because of Christmas. Now that my son's in elementary school, I see kids routinely tease or even ostracize each other based on the stuff they don't own. "What? You don't have a wii? What a dork!" There’s shame in not owning the latest crap. And actually, I think the refusal (or inability) to consume is perceived as very challenging in both the adult and kid worlds. Lots of people think my wife and I are slightly freakish for not owning a car or a TV; they seem to see it as some sort of failure—maybe I’m being paranoid and insecure, I often think some see it specifically as my failure as the father, since the father is supposed to be the breadwinner and thus the provider of junk. Our natural response has been to surround ourselves with people who also don't own cars and TVs and other crap, though of course then you start to live in a bubble. This to me is a classic parenting dilemma, for people across the political and cultural spectrum: how do you raise a child so that they can resist the negative aspects of the culture while still being equipped to thrive in that culture?

The trial raises a number of issues. One is the international ramifications of corruption in Nigeria; the money trail and the tendency of elites to spend and store money abroad means that corruption becomes an international affair. Another issue is whether the case will significantly affect the atmosphere in Nigeria, either in terms of frightening currently serving politicians or strengthening calls within Nigeria for similar trials. And, while there is pessimism on that score, there is the possibility that further international trials will take place for Nigerian politicians.
The steps in this process seem to come in clusters, which is emotionally draining. It seems that nothing happens, then things happen in a flourish, then it is quiet again. It is actually an unnatural process, since most of our lives are pretty orderly and predictable. Even pregnancy develops a sort of rhythm over time, culminating in the moment you meet your child. Adoption isn't like this.

Originally formed in 1935 to represent hourly workers at Boeing, District Lodge 751 of the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers now represents more than 31,500 working men and women at 48 employers across Washington, Oregon and California. In December, District 751 members ratified a four-year contract extension with Boeing that ensured the 737 MAX will be built in Puget Sound.
In chapter 21, a sacrifice is defined for an unsolved murder, if someone is found dead and no one can be charged with it. There was allowance to take a female captive as a wife, if so desired. There was no tolerance for rebellious and stubborn sons. They were taken outside the camp and stoned to death.

The effort, the deliberateness, the close-but-no-cigar approximation of popular brands were both unsettling and exhausting and triggered a cellular defensiveness that made me physically uncomfortable by the time I rounded the end of the first long aisle. It was a European’s carefully crafted but target-missing interpretation of America — like when in the mid-80s I saw the Austrian consul and his wife sporting a zoot suit and I-Dream-of-Jeannie hairstyle, respectively, at a Goethe Institute event and a Vietnamese national took issue with my bemusement because they looked exactly as he thought Americans should. It felt like I was walking through the Ikea of grocery stores, or a 3-d model of a set for a Simpsons episode, without that show’s intended irony.
I went to the Lynaugh prison yesterday. So missed attending the 4 day Kairos event we had planned so hard for. At the prison I shared something I had read when I was in prison over 30 years ago. It was a poem that I no longer know word for word, but the message still remains with me. The poem told of a man driving along and noticing a group of workers busy tearing down a building. He stops and talks with the foreman of the group, who tells him, “In a minute or two, I can tear down what others took years to do”. When I first heard this decades ago it had an impact on me, for the truth is it is much easier to tear down than it is to build up.
See, right now I’m on the ‘seated’ section of a sleeper car on an overnight trip to Copenhagen from Amsterdam. It’s a cabin almost identical to those seen on the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter movies–the kind of cabin for those people too cheap to pay the extra £10 or so for an actual bed. With me in the cabin is a Danish couple (I assume by their first language) who mostly keep to themselves, but are friendly and conversational if the opportunity presents itself. I can only assume that they’re not entirely confident in their English-speaking skills. In the cabin next to us, though, through these soundproof-less and thin metal walls, is a group of men most likely native to Amsterdam, from the smatterings of broken, butchered English I’ve heard from them. They have been both this trip’s annoyance, and the in-flight movie entertainment from what I’ve heard through the walls. That is, I’m not sure whether I should laugh or get angry at them.

Then the credits rolled over a still shot of what we are all assuming is Colonel Sanders, or possibly a young Orville Redenbacher, and Starkwell noticed an absurd amount of actors in this movie that have just one name, like JULISSA, SANATON, URINAL, FARFLE II, MARTINIQUE or like, you know, Cher. Ok, some of those weren’t real. There is a lot of randomly placed narration, here and there, assumedly because without out it, none of this would make any sense, what with the belly dancing, steel drum players and close-ups on skeleton crotches.

And so with Intelligent Design. The idea that the Universe was created - designed - by a Creator may indeed be correct. As they say, a watch needs a Watchmaker. However, there is no conceivable experiment that could prove or disprove this hypothesis. The Intelligent Design folks have performed heroically in creating a scientific framework that in many ways explains the workings of the Universe. In many ways. But the gaps in the hypothesis loom large, not least of which being that Darwin and his contemporaries had to address very similar objections in the nineteenth century. A study of history will show debates about Watchmakers, and the equivalent of Irreducible complexity, and arguments like "of what use is half an eye?"

It's a long report which I intend reading later but it promises to be like a "course" on Libyan history. If you are a history buff, it's worth reading in full.
Unfortunately, where the ‘True Loves’ series fails is its illustration. Botma’s story draws you in despite the art. The Vancouver location will add an extra element for locals, however there is something to be found for most readers here as ‘True Loves’ is a comment not only on Canadian life, but on the lives of western youth globally. It is also a demonstration on where the sentimental urges of the authors towards each other, and a lack of unbiased criticism, can drag down a work which had the potential to be far better.
When I first saw you, I called you “that beautiful boy in the picture taped to Sam’s wall.” And you were beautiful, even back then, with your whole curly head peroxide blond and your arms wrapped around the shoulders of Sam and some other girl I didn’t know. The first time I saw you in person, walking the hallways of Armwood High School, a little light went off in my head and my heart leapt into my throat and I thought, “That’s him!” You were even more fantastically good-looking in person, and you were tall and thin as a rail. And you smiled and you turned to your best friend walking next to you and you said something. I found out that day that I would call you Caleb, and I found out years later that day was when you told your friend that you were going to marry me.

Who doesn’t love the idea of a makeover? Whether it’s a personal makeover, a financial makeover or an organizational makeover, most people seem to like the idea of taking something that they have and use on a daily basis and improving on it and getting rid of the things that don’t work. Look through any number of magazines or cable channels and you are bound to see some sort of article or show “doing” a makeover. As I said, who doesn’t love a makeover?
When I became an adult and realized I’d never be cool anyway, I hit the “seek” button on my car radio and came across a song about how the good stuff in life is all the memories you build with those you love.

In fact, I went out way too fast. I think the reason I did so well at Chase was because the crowd kept me from going out too fast and thinned up towards the end allowing me to speed up. This race on Saturday wasn't every large (capped at 1000 people) so it was easy to get up to speed at the beginning. When I did my first mile in just over 8 minutes I wondered if I'd be able to hold that pace. I really wanted to do my running group proud. At one point a guy passing me must have read my club tank top because he said, "Hey! The Oak Park Runners! You guys are famous!"

The city that was determined to have existed in these environs and which indeed contained a living population, seems to have amounted to an amazingly low figure of from 400 to 1000 persons.

3) Resolutions give wings to discipline – Paul told Timothy, “discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness” (1 Timothy 4:7), but Paul was not saying this as some mountaintop guru who intended Timothy to figure out what that meant on his own. No, instead, Paul gave Timothy specific goals to meet with the discipline he commanded – “set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity” (4:12); “Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching” (4:16). Without goals discipline will fizzle in time because, like a runner without a finish line, discipline without aim is just exertion.

Linn was a masterful quote wrangler, as well as an inveterate list-maker. Many-if-not-all of her True Colors pages included long slender tags of hand-made or specialized papers, inscribed with her distinctive rounded hand-writing. The tags listed……things that are White, the colors of Fall, the shades of a sunset. Always with graceful strands of silky threads and fibers to hold them in place…..Very Linn. I always featured her, sitting at her art table writing out each tag, working fast to keep up with her quick playful mind – and then looking up and finding dozens of tags – and then turning those over to use the backs, too.
Why did this work so well? Firstly, this is the only instance of a film that combines so many major actors, all of them leading men, into a single narrative. While each of these characters’ respective origin tales required them as the centerpiece and everyone else to fit into the cookie-cutter archetypes required for narrative momentum, this movie didn’t have to. They had their backstories. They had their personalities. And we’ve all seen them. Repeatedly. Thus, all they had to do was combine and let them have at it. The result is copulatory. Seeing Robert Downey Jr. leap delightfully into a tete a tete with Chris Evans is something you will never see again…until the inevitable The Avengers 2: Electric Boogaloo. Thus, we are left with a Blockbuster that does not leave us bored to tears the second the action stops. In fact, we’re all wishing the aliens could fuck off for another ten minutes while Downey Jr. delivers another few zingers. Seriously. That’s just rude.
But in the world as most of us encounter it, how much choice do we actually have about the beneficial results of our livelihood? In modern Western society, conditions are such that we can usually avoid work that is dishonest and overtly harmful. Still, how many people are ever offered work that is unquestionably beneficial and hurts no one? With the best will, can we actually follow a livelihood that is "right" in every sense? Do we have a moral right to impoverish others who depend on us -- spouses, children, aged parents -- so we can congratulate ourselves on our right livelihood?
Be careful of words in all caps for emphasis – it’s a big part of rage and anger. You lose the effect if you use it more than just once or twice. It really expresses the emotion when you use it rarely. When you’re putting the caps in, people aren’t used to reading them in all caps, so it stops the reader.

So why should his son’s challenging, straight talking dance teacher get under his skin in a way no other female has? He tells himself it is because Casey is the only one able to bring his shy, uncommunicative son out of his shell. Or is it because Drew has finally met his match?
The resolution we advocate is also a product of collaboration; we built it from two model ordinances developed by the Bill of Rights Defense Committee and the ACLU, and worked with those organizations and the Defending Dissent Foundation to perfect it. The result is a resolution that has been vetted by some of the best legal minds and civil liberties advocates in the country, and that is explicitly endorsed by the Maryland ACLU, the BORDC, Defending Dissent, and SAALT.

When I was first diagnosed with diabetes, I tried cutting waaay back on my carbs. My blood sugar dropped and I lost a lot of weight but I was very unhappy with the food I was eating. Now, I take a more balanced approach. I eat carbohydrates but I try to do so in moderation. And I make it a point to eat 100% whole grain carbs at least 90% of the time. If I can't find a favorite food item in a whole grain variety, then I make my own. It's fun converting many of my favorite white-flour recipes into whole grain dishes. Many times, I can do it without anyone noticing the difference.
Why is the logo a heart shape? Well, we had explained to Cecil and Ana how our enterprise will be a family business, we as twins working hard together and our mum helping us occasionally and Dad always hovering in the background. As Ana explained when she went through it with us, the heart symbolises our unity as a family working on the business together and it also epitomises the fact that we put the customer first, our central ethos is to help the customer and ensure they have a good shopping experience.
Sylvie thought a little ambient music might go down well, but one of her friends, D, a tax inspector (always good to know one!) told her to turn it off as it clashed with the TV which was still on.

After the individual dances, is the ChaChaCha marathon, where everyone dances on the dance floor at the same time and they each get tapped on the shoulder as they are taken out. The longer they stay on the dance floor, the higher score they get. Poor Gladys gets tapped out f irst. Ouch. Everybody is doing quite well but at one point I see Maria resting on her laurels and she gets tapped out immediately. There is no such punishment for William Levy. Everytime I see him out there, he seems to be doing….nothing. Just like in his individual dance, this guy is trying to get away with his good looks and popularity. Donald and Peta are hustling out there, Maks and Melissa are pulling out all stops, Katherine and Mark are dancing up a storm. At one point, William just stands there, LITERALLY JUST STANDS THERE, for at least fifteen seconds. Then he spends the rest of the time pulling his shirt open and then sliding across the stage on his knees. This is the chachacha marathon, amigo, not a Van Halen video. I keep waiting for him to get tapped out but he stays alive til the near end. He ends up second, garnering nine coveted points, when others who were actually aware that this was a dancing competition, not a standing contest, got booted out faster. The only blessing is that he isn’t last on the floor and that honour goes to Katherine and Mark. My sister and I are up in arms at this Levy character and the power of Bruno.
Stamps: Something to Celebrate, Wild About You
The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the terror attacks around the world has fueled an interest in Islam, if only in self defense. The Topkapi Secret by Terry Kelhawk ($25.00, Prometheus Books) is a story of cultures clashing and the emotions that soar as Arab researcher Mohammed Atareek and American professor Angela Hall race away from death towards discovery. Will what they learn about the Koran cost them their lives or change the world? It centers on a fictional Topkapi Codex, an ancient manuscript of the Koran involved in the murder that split Islam into two sects, Shiites and Sunni. In the novel, Atareek is obsessed with getting his hands on the manuscript, displayed within the Topkapi Palace Museum in Istanbul. Years ago Topkapi was the locale of a novel made into a movie involving an attempted gem theft. This book offers a comparable tale, but one with explosive potential. Another novel reflects the culture clash that has stamped this decade from 9/11 to Iraq to Afghanistan as Americans respond to the threat to their way of life, values, and freedom. Lipstick in Afghanistan ($15.00, Gallery Books, softcover) by Roberta Gately is the story of an American nurse’s life-changing journey into a war zone. It is the story of Elsa who dreamed of being a nurse and of leaving her working class Boston neighborhood to help people whose lives are far more difficult than her own. Her secret weapon is a tube of lipstick and, when she uses it, she can take on any challenge. Still, even nights as an emergency room nurse could not prepare her for the devastation she witnesses at a small medical clinic she runs in Bamiyan. For an insightful look at the harsh realities of Afghanistan, a dash of romance, and some adventure, this story, based on real life experience is well worth reading.
With regard to the tuyilam illam, however, I challenge the pragmatic value attached to this course of action. For one: from circa September 2008 the Tamil people of the Vanni, perhaps some 300,000 to 350,000 all told, subjected themselves to multiple displacements or were pushed to do so by the LTTE. From January 2009 they found themselves corralled within increasingly limited space, subject to starvation diet and to the escalating jackboot of the LTTE. From that point they were a bargaining chip in the LTTE design, prisoners in the Eelam cause.

The secret service scandal underscores the hypocritical approach of the U.S. government to fight global sex trafficking of women and children. The L.A. Times reported recently that the U.S. government fired three more Secret Service agents as a result of hiring prostitutes during the Summit of Americas in early April. This brings the total to half a dozen agents who saw their careers cut short from the widening investigation of alleged misconduct.

This post is a revised version of a text that appeared a few days ago in Al Jazeera English, and seeks to use the selection of an American as the new President of the World Bank both to expose the fraudulent claim of a merit-based selection process and to insist indirectly that the future peace and justice of the world requires a more democratic and legitimate structure of global governance that reflects the post-colonial rise of the non-West, a rise that is not reflected in antiquated structures that persist despite changed conditions.

Even non-Christians know this scripture quote about our body being temple, yet we ignore it as easily as we ignore God's other instructions and laws. It starts from the top of the food chain and ends in our hearts. The problem that we are having (others and my family) is that the government and corporations have made it virtually impossible to go "back to basics" in this world. I am not only referring to our food sources, but also the generations of change in products, utilities and leadership in this nation.

All I want is to be a writer full-time. I would love to be able to have that be my job. My dream–and goal, if I am going to be honest–is to be able to write stories for the rest of my life and get paid to do so. This comes with a problem in that being a freelance writer is not a lucrative career. Some do not consider it a career at all.
On September 11, 2010, I had the awesome privilege of not only attending the focal point of Pride Week, but I was invited to speak as a special guest. Having recently taken steps to file incorporation papers for St. John's Pride Inc., I knew that attending and meeting with the founders of Corner Brook Pride would prove to be a valuable experience.
As discussed in my “March New Album Leak Reviews” post from the week before last, as well as in a couple of my recent YouTube videos, I am completely obsessed with “The Hunger Games” – the book series, the film and the film’s soundtrack have all been a heavy influence on me here recently. I absolutely loved the books and have seen the film in the theater twice already. I have also been playing the soundtrack like crazy here lately. It got me thinking about other film soundtracks that have impacted me over the years, so I thought it would be fun to do a post on some of my favorite songs from film soundtracks over the years. I decided it would be a good idea to focus on films from the 2000s, as this is the time that I remember the most films from and, in a lot of ways, the period in which I have had the most musical experience… well, kind of. To be frank, as I was sitting here thinking about music from different films that have impacted me, everything that I came up with, for the most part, was from that period. So, that having been said, let’s get right to it.
This is not a hard and fast rule, and this tenet is not very popular with music geeks, but in general I think pop musicians have a wider scope of influence than cult musicians. Obviously, there are exceptions to that rule (eg: The Pixies. But who ever thought indie rock would become pop?)

Profanity presents the descriptive lexicographer with a few unique challenges. Obscenities and vulgar terms are a veritable treasure trove–so many! such richness!–but very few of the truly original ones make it into print. Witness the New Yorker‘s recent article on Rick Santorum, which touched briefly on the generic noun “santorum,” coined in 2003 in response to some controversial comments the Senator made on homosexuality. The article says that the definition of “santorum” is unprintable. This, it’s worth mentioning, is coming from a magazine that routinely prints “fuck” in all its various incarnations. Much of our printed evidence for the lower-case “santorum” sadly reads just like that New Yorker blurb: “blah blah blah santorum (a word so vile that we cannot possibly tell you what it means, but we’re going to use words like “leak” and “backdoor” and “frothy” in the next paragraph in a veiled attempt to euphemize “santorum” and thereby escape an obscenity fine or court injunction).”

As for the plot, don’t bother looking for one. You won’t be able to find it amidst all of the hooking up and drinking. Justine seems to wander aimlessly around, travelling from country to country on her rich father’s money and generally acting like a spoiled brat. Okay, I know how it feels when the man of your dreams belongs to someone else, but sooner or later you have to grow up, get over it and move on. Justine doesn’t and that’s part of the reason why I was so frustrated with this book by page 43.
There is an old joke about a flood. As the water was raising the man inside the house prayed for God’s help. Someone in a row-boat rowed by offering a ride but the man said God would save him. A speed boat operator offered his help but the man said God would save him. As the water’s raised even higher, the man climbed on his roof, a helicopter flies over-head offering safety but the man said God would save him. Then the man drowns. When he gets to heaven the man asks God a question. Why death since his faith was so strong? God said to him, I sent you a rowboat, a speed boat and a helicopter.

One thing that disturbed me was the fact that while her attitude about getting rid of her virginity was something I've seen before when I was a teen, so it was realistically shown, it was more the fact that she ended up treating sex so casually and how she wasn't sad that she'd given it away to a guy she didn't even like was a bit difficult for me to digest. Yes, the scene felt realistic. Her heart wasn't in it and thus "getting laid" wasn't that big of a deal because for her it was a means to an end. Most of the time when girls do agree to have sex for the first time it's because they have feelings for the guy. I guess it bugged me that in her heart she treated her purity like it didn't mean much. I would have liked to see her realizing that she should have waited for someone she loved. Or had some regrets and not told people she was "fine" afterward. If the author intended to show some remorse, I wasn't feeling it.

Under such circumstances, who has the stronger claim to speak on behalf of the people: the president or the legislative majority that opposes his policies? Since both derive their power from the votes of the people in a free competition among well-defined alternatives, a conflict is always possible and at times may erupt dramatically. Theme is no democratic principle on the basis of which it can be resolved, and the mechanisms the constitution might provide are likely to prove too complicated and aridly legalistic to be of much force in the eyes of the electorate. It is therefore no accident that in some such situations in the past, the armed forces were often tempted to intervene as a mediating power. (source)

Darkness inspires the dreams of sleep as well as the dreams of wakefulness. I'm sure you have heard people say, "Close your eyes and imagine...". What happens when you close your eyes? You create a personal state of darkness where there are no overt visual distractions and you can focus on an inner state of peace. It's good to dream whether it be nightdreams or daydreams. So close your eyes and dream of things as they have been, as they are, and as they could be. All that has been accomplished was initially dreamed. Let your dreams work for you. And don't be afraid of the dark.

Having a roadmap is often the only difference between staying on track and driving off the cliff. But once in a while, stepping off the beaten path can lead to something new and fun. For instance, I started to worry about having enough goodies to give away, so I planned to make a large batch of cookies. I had a recipe printed out and all the ingredients on hand when I spotted a can of sweetened condensed milk, some uraro (arrowroot) biscuits and a bottle of rum . . . When the cocoa dust finally settled, the cookies had turned into these soft and crunchy rummy-fudgy bites. With just that bit of spontaneity, what was in danger of becoming a chore became an instance of fun. It's not a monthlong vacation on the beach, but such small carefree moments can be more than enough to revive your energy and spirit. So, for those inevitable days in the New Year when worries start to weigh you down, rip up the recipe and dump everything into the bowl. You never know what sweet surprise might come together.

What would happen if, like Jesus and A2, we put the hard demands of the gospel front and center? If we dispensed with slick campaigns and puffed up promises and gave people the unvarnished truth of what it means to follow Jesus? If we told them that sometimes following the Carpenter from Nazareth means donning your own crown of thorns? I’m sure it would cost us numbers up front, but would it be worth it in the end? I think it would be. How about you?

Did I do all the morning pages? Yes. And I forget I've done them. I'm amazed I find the time to do them. I also wish I could write more, I rattle on for agggeeess. I've just started my second notebook and i've been wondering what to do with the book after as i dont like clutter so i've decided that after the 12 week course is over im going to switch to computer morning pages. It should encourage me to blog more too if i start setting aside time every day to sit at the computer. At the moment its just strewn in the corner covered in paints and paper or whatever im experimenting with and is very much neglected.
When did all this start to go wrong? Actually, it started going wrong on Saturday when I awoke feeling like I had been run over twice by an 18 wheeler. For a week, I had been taking "Sudafed" because of a sinus thing that had me using whole boxes of Kleenex per day. I got the "you have to ask for it and sign your name for it and promise you won't be making crack cocaine out of it" type of Sudafed. I figured that if it didn't clear up my sinuses, I would indeed make up some crack cocaine just to make myself feel better. You know, either / or.
i guess when i get down to it - my main issue with the week is that it's been so crazy and off-kilter that i worry it is really me that is crazy and off-kilter. know that feeling? it's sort of that feeling that if you can't find the drunk at the party - it's probably you. right?

What can make a poker internet site really make money? It is not just in attracting buyers with truly large rakebacks. It is mostly from the entertaining from the adventure. Sure, it can be nice to have some on the funds back again but you can also contemplate the high quality inside the games you play. There will not be any enjoyable in actively playing games that do offer you better rakebacks and other bonuses but place you to sleep anyway due to the fact another avid gamers aren’t that skillful. You can not be learning something below and if anything, it’s detrimental to your skill since you are not being challenged sufficient.

We were served two Cobblers, both without ice but using our new Lewis bags we crushed ice and heaped it into one of them. The other got just a few pieces. After a bit we tried both to see how cold and dilution affected this classic drink. And we learned that if you looked at the the crushed bits of ice they looked like cobblestones, hence the name.

* Jasmine adores ABC Reading Eggs, and manages to pass the quizzes at the end of each map BUT has reached a level that she finds hard to do alone. She refuses to repeat any activities, and insists on continuing on to harder lessons. Her persistence, frustration and desire to read create an interesting tension at times! I try to figure out when to help and when to stay out of the way.
For a couple of weeks I kept my head firmly wedged in that big pile of sand I keep handy for such occasions. I started planning a graduation party for him, made arrangements to get some pictures taken for his graduation announcements.
Ryan wowed our guests with his achievement of being the first ever 1 year old to read. Its true. He sits there and it looks like he’s really reading. Sometimes he even reads aloud. According to his teachers, he does this at school and the other kids gather around to listen. What can I say….my son is a genius.
"Sounds weird!" I say.

Vince’s little girls loved to swing. Their eyes lit up every time they saw a park with a swing. He didn’t know what it was about the swing. It was probably the feeling of flying and the thrill of falling all at once. They would let out a shrill cry as they’d get too high in the air, immediately followed by laughter.
We're heading back to my doc again this morning. I just don't get how I can be on day 4 of a Z-pack and not be improved. The obvious answer is that it's not the right med for the job. So we'll see... I'm losing my patience, though.

Since 1986, media killings became rampant as early as the country acquired democracy from Marcos’ regime. Ironically, the newly obtained freedom marked a culture that soon threatens the nation. Extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance, name it all; the ‘democratic’ country has it.

Pooplette got to have her first real Burpday Partay with invited guests. She turned four, and if you don't know, turning four is like totally THE social occasion. I asked everyone to please remember that this birthday was giftless, considering we're still in the hovel and have NO SPACE, but apparently my French is still terrible, or I was ignored. They were kind enough, however, to stick to small surprises, and we've somehow managed to integrate these new treasures without too much trouble. I blew up 200 balloons for the occasion, dumped all of them on the floor and let the kids loose. If you ever need ideas for a 4th birthday I highly recommend this. The kids ran around for an hour chasing balloons, tossing balloons, kicking balloons, and tiring themselves out in the process. No need to plan any activities because they're so occupied with the damn balloons that they just don't care to do anything else. Until the cake comes out, of course, but I honestly thing that was only because we had one of those indoor fireworks candles and that caught their attention. So, then we had cake. And that was good! But those balloons....

Are you familiar with the DABWAHA Tournament? I guess you probably are, but just in case, it’s an annual Competition put together by the fantastic people over at Dear Author and by Sarah Wendell of Smart Bitches Trashy Books. Each year they choose eight books in eight different categories, for a total of sixty-four books, to go against each other in the ultimate battle of the romance novels. The books compete in tournament-like brackets and readers get to vote which book wins each round until just one book remains. It’s lots of fun and there are prices for the winners, and most importantly, it’s another list filled with the best of the best books of the year, so it gives us the opportunity to discover books that may have gone unnoticed otherwise.
Today we went to find a headstone. I have not been able to commit to looking for one, but I think we found the one today. It is a heart design, the lady from the monument company is sending outlines via e-mail of what it will look like with the wording on it. We decided we will have the flower holder installed so that maybe our flowers will not get mowed down! I was dreading doing this, up until we went looking. The first place we went, the prices were way higher for very plain headstones. The second place had beautiful stones for less than the first place and the woman working walked us right through everything. It was nice to have some guidance because we have never went headstone shopping and all I knew was what I did not want, and no ideas for what to look for.
"Yes, well I am going to order a proper one for the purpose, but I thought that it would do for now."
In sum, we can think about the future in ways that will benefit our children, our elders, our health, and our economic well-being if we consider evidence and findings from this new field of inquiry. As we continue to pull ourselves out of the economic downturn, we can turn our attention back to the social and health implications of what we build. The benefits will be tangible.

Otherwise, I’ve been obsessing with the new BBC cooking series, “My Little Paris Kitchen” (La Petit Cuisine a Paris) with Rachel Khoo. A Le Cordon Blue trained Brit with a diverse heritage, Rachel moved to Paris a few years ago to pursue her culinary studies. Her joie de vivre is contagious and her recipes make French cooking appear as easy as pie. Although she obtained a patisserie degree from Le Cordon Blue, her repertoire includes much more than just pastries and her recipes intend to show how Parisians really cook at home. Rachel deconstructs with delightful ease and a pinch of naughtiness an array of French culinary favourites from Boeuf Bourguignon and Coq au Vin to Madeleines and Choux pastry in her tiny Parisian kitchen-cum-restaurant. Her down-to-earth attitude and genuine enthusiasm for food inspire me to experiment in the kitchen and more importantly, to love life.

I hadn't planned much past Saturday. Everything was for that day. Sunday morning I felt like I was missing something. And actually I was! I had misplaced my Sunday School teachers manual in the wedding rush and was very unprepared for my little preschooler children that I teach. We got to church a smidge early and I scrambled. How on EARTH was I going to teach the kids about Potiphar's wife without some guidance from that teacher's manual???
In the meantime I am terrified the book I want to write is out there, being written right now by someone else. This has happened to me before, I have perfectly serviceable ideas only to find some other - usually better- author has beaten me to it. So - for now- my lips are very tightly zipped.

I made a promise to myself that I would take some time this summer to read some of the classic books and novels I've never read. So, right now I'm reading Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. I'm hooked. I just had to ink up this adorable image, because right now I have pirates on the brain. I really love this little pirate. LOVE. :)

Today is Wifesy’s birthday and I’m super excited for it. I have an entire day planned for her and I can’t reveal it just now because I fear she may read this blog whilst I make her breakfast in bed. Yes, that’s what I plan to do. We are nauseating like this when it comes to our love. I’m even going to carve a rose out of a tomato. Hopefully, it won’t look like a blood clot instead of a rose. Chances are 50% blood clot, 50% rose. I don’t have a breakfast tray as of yet, either. So, I may have to give it all to her on a plate, which may get messy, but I don’t care if she gets egg yolk all over the bed. I love her and today she can do as she goddamn well pleases.
Farred could not hide his intense dislike for the lacrosse players. He denounced—without citing any evidence—“the lacrosse team’s reputed tendency toward arrogant sexual prowess.” (Imagine the appropriate outrage if a professor had made such a generic claim about, say, his African-American students.) He asserted that the team had a “criminal history.” (Yes, according to the Coleman Committee report: the same “criminal history” of hundreds of other Duke students who had alcohol-related violations.)

“I don’t think our church is the only true and living church,” I rambled. “Not to say there isn’t a lot of good in it, or that there isn’t truth in it, or that it can’t bring a person closer to God.

Amnesty International flagged police torture, deaths in custody, extrajudicial killings and threats to the work of human rights defenders as matters of concern in South Africa. It cited Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD) figures for April 2009 to March 2010 - which recorded five direct complaints against the police of torture and 920 complaints of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm by the police - and only some of which were being investigated for evidence of torture. Seven of 294 deaths in custody in 2010 were linked to torture and 90 others to â€œinjuries sustained in custody.

What many people fail to realize is that a lot of skinny girls are just as sensitive about their size as overweight girls. I for one find it completely rude for people to say, “you’re so skinny, do you eat?” Would it be socially correct for me to go up to a fat person and say, “you’re so fat, when do you stop eating?” Contrary to belief, when you’re skinny you cannot just eat a lot and then be thick. Genetics, metabolisms and other factors contribute to your weight.

It might be our weight, it could be our morals, or our devotional lives – any number of things. Why is it that when we know we would feel better and be better people if we kept to the discipline of these things we still go slack on them? Read the verses below and gain inspiration straight from the Word to encourage you to move ahead in whatever area is defeating you or taking glory away from God. I fully intend to get back into shape and look good for my son’s wedding – and I hope to stay that way, having reached my goal! I wish the same for you.
This movie got a whole lot of ink about the heroin thing. That is definitely a great part of the showcase of Sinatra’s talents and shocking material for this time in American film history. There’s more to the movie, though. It’s got a lot going on. Way to go, Blue Eyes.

The essential point to make here is that the average Democratic Party member is very likely not as intelligent as the average Republican, since the Democratic Party contains more minorities, who on average score lower on IQ tests than whites. But once you point out something like that, liberals go into IQ denial.
“And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”

Since then, not only did we engineer a kick-ass bottle washer, but we have streamlined the label removal, have a light table for bottle inspection, and we successfully petitioned the bottle manufacturer to change materials used for the bottle gaskets (previously 1/15 bottles failed to hold carbonation; now it is more like 1/150, and most of those turn out to have a tiny crack here or there).

These "Look, something wacky! Now buy our shit" commercials are popping up with more and more frequency all over the television dial. (If you're under 30, ask your parents. TVs used to have dials.

They're spreading like a rash across the supple, rosy-hued flesh of prime time, and there is no salve, balm, or unguent in sight.

When I first saw this commentary, the first thing I noticed was how brief the book was: 112 pages in length. It is a compact introduction of Philippians covers the basic points of this epistle. Well, given that fact that Philippians is not a long letter, I am amazed that some commentators can write 800 pages on this epistle. However, given the nature of the NTL/OTL series of commentaries, it provides the necessary basics and does not aim to go too much into depth. It is ideal for pastors and students who want a basic understanding of this epistle without too much detailed reading. This is even shorter than the Pillar commentary.
My depression began when I was a teenager and surfaced intermittently for around 20 years with episodes lasting anywhere from months to 4-5 years at a time. The concern of a friend saved me the first time I was on the brink of suicide. I was in college carrying 20 credits, had moved out of my parent's house, was working part time to support myself and suffered two significant losses on the same day. One was the suicide of someone I loved dearly. After a while suicidal urges and planning how to take my own life began occupying my thoughts. I simply wasn't able to cope. I told a friend, who told her mom who was a therapist. Her mom offered to talk to me (in free counseling sessions) for several months until I was out of danger.

Most folks think of booze when you say Frugal MacDoogal. You can now add barbecue to that name, at least for festivals and such. The well-known Nashville liquor store has been making barbecue on the road lately, winning the People’s Choice award at the recent Nashville Barbecue Festival. They set up shop at Oktoberfest/Germantown Street Fest this weekend and that gave me the opportunity to check it out. It’s a pre-sauced pulled pork, a choice that usually leaves me less than enthusiastic. However, this isn’t your typical over-sauced tomato wash. The sauce is a rather unique set of flavors that gives the pork a huskier flavor. Pretty darn good. The baked beans on the side were also a treat helped along by chunks of smoky bacon. Not sure where you’ll see the Frugal barbecue set-up next, but keep your eyes open.
Returning to the boat, the skipper took us a short way to a beach side restaurant where we ate a reasonable meal that was surprisingly not too expensive – being the only restaurant for miles it is a credit to them that the prices were not super-inflated.

“You’ll need to tell me where that’s written down in law: that it must be a police matter purely because you say so. This man is in YOUR legal custody if YOU’VE sectioned him. this is by virtue of s137 of the Mental Health Act and your authority to detain and convey comes from s6.”
Let me start with the good news. We are, all of us without exception, native speakers. This may come as a surprise to those of us who have had close encounters with the second/foreign language world, but is nonetheless true. It means that we are all competent users of language – more or less competent, of course, depending on all sorts of individual and social factors that make us clumsy or proficient in whatever we do.
But the technique itself cannot. Other people can teach the technique, other people can blog about it, other people can write books on it. They have only done something wrong if they've literally copied and pasted your exact tutorial - words, photos, etc - into their blog, book, handout, etc.
For those of you who don’t know, Miss Ashley appeared last week at an event with a “puffy face”. And she caught hell for it. Seems she had a sinus infection and was on some steroids to get rid of it. There’s this thing called moon face that y’all should know about. It happens when people are on prescription steroids. It causes your face get round and “puffy”. It’s a medical side effect. Ask anyone who has been on steroids for an extended amount of time, and they’ll tell you that besides going bonkers, this is usually their least favorite side effect. It happens, it’s a reality, and it something that no one, including beautiful actresses are immune to. Puffy happens to the best of us through no fault of our own. But with no real evidence to back it up, all the sudden a puffy face becomes plastic surgery. A woman can’t possible age that gracefully, so clearly, she must have gone under the knife. Really? Really!
That this feel good smile is still at its charming best in modern popular culture is evident in cinematographic representations such as Colin Farrell’s The New World and Kevin Costner’s Dances with Wolves. Films that, in brief, try their sentimental utmost to convince the emotion- intoxicated viewer that primitive societies were (and are) virtuous to the core and that their conquerors, the West, embodies all that human depravity could muster in its quest to destroy all that is beautiful and innocent on the planet.

This story is from February 11, 2012, and it has never been told to anyone…until now. TheGirl and I went on a weekend trip–she called it for Valentine’s Day, but I called it “I got a coupon for a discounted weekend at this resort” weekend. We stayed Friday-Sunday, and this story happened on the Saturday night that we were there.
We've recently been without a pastor for quite awhile and our conference was trying to decide what to do with us. We were in a district with two other small churches. They decided to put us in a district with a larger church instead, which means we would share their pastor, which is where we are now. Except because of the negative rap we've gotten in the past, they have decided to watch us to see if they want to actually put us officially with the larger church or...just let us die. The pastor is over-seeing us. I don't think they have ever heard good things about us. It's unfair, really. Lately our church has been changing so much. I can really see God in it. And a man (that I knew a few years back in another church) is joining that said the reason he came was because he heard about what was going on and wanted to help us. He even said that if they closed our church and put the church and parsonage up for sale, he would even consider buying it...that was after I told him that if they shut this church down - we'd start a new one. We need a church in our town. So I know the Lord is working here. I feel it - things are happening.
Education is not the answer when high value-added, high wage manufacturing and professional service jobs, such as software engineering, are moved offshore in order to enhance short-term profits for shareholders and multi-million dollar bonuses for CEOs, while domestic employment and purchasing power are destroyed. Unless American university graduates can emigrate to China and India, there is no one to employ them. Yet, we still hear the call to run up student loan debts beyond the ability of salaries to repay the loans.

In this lovely park-like setting amidst very fashionable stores, dogs are not only welcome but encouraged to shop with their owners! I'm just sayin' this is a very good business strategy because there's lot of things hanging in mom's closet that wouldn't be there if I wasn't welcome here.
And therefore, I offer an old tried and true meatball recipe. I attended a funeral at the Presbyterian church nearby years ago and the church ladies served these meatballs by the piles. I was thinking that I needed to go to Presbyterian funerals more often!!
(7) He has informed that it (this bargain) is written in the Best Books revealed from the heavens (i.e. the Torah, the Gospel, the Qur’an).
the happiness project is basically 12 resolutions broken down and tackled each month of the year. ranging from friendships to vitality to money and everywhere in between. i've started my own happiness project this year and while i plan to follow gretchen on some of her monthly resolutions - not all apply to my life so i'll be working on a few of my own.
Meanwhile, here's a little taste of what's to come on Bilingual Butter...I told you there would be more mother-daughter cakes!
Wigransky goes on to mention that 69 million perfectly, happy, normal American boys and girls read comic books to no ill effect and that Wertham is basically loading the deck with his 25 depraved criminal juvenile case studies, asking them leading questions, all with the mission to get them to mention comic books during their "psychoanalysis" with the doctor.
So say we all!
It's getting closer to the due date, and I can't help but wonder where the time went. We waited so late to tell everyone, and I have been so busy with work, taking care of NIk, holidays, showers, and birthdays, that I can barely believe we only have 2 1/2 months left (10 weeks Thursday). I find myself trying to mentally slow time down. I am so excited to welcome this new little pupmkin, but worried about my little pumpkin at home. I so want to treasure these last weeks I have her all to myself, hoping that she welcomes this new little brother or sister with a welcome and open heart. She does love her Mommy time. I just want to be able to give them both the time and lvoe they deserve and not feel completely overwhelmed.
- Groupon terms are also supposedly far from endearing: “Each time Groupon sells a voucher to users, it collects cash up-front. Merchants’ share of the proceeds, which averages about 60% world-wide, is remitted later—sometimes much later. In North America, merchants get paid in installments over 60 days. Internationally, it typically takes 70 days.” Seems Living Social pays within 15 days and Google says they will pay within 4 days. (WSJ: http://on.wsj.com/oO2XdQ).
Jeddah is a city with an interesting mix of the ancient and the thoroughly modern and has a charm all its own. It is a melting pot of sorts, a unique place to live with inhabitants from all over the world. Jeddah is steeped in tradition and rich in culture yet leads the way in welcoming and accepting the outside world. I look forward to discovering more of this fascinating place and sharing my findings with you.

The remnant can trust in this:
The appointment of former inspector-general of police Tun Mohamad Hanif Omar to head of the independent panel to probe incidents of violence during the Bersih 3.0 rally has raised deep public concerns that the investigation will either be a whitewash of police brutality on peaceful demonstrators, a massive cover-up of the sufferings of the victims or a pretext to justify BN’s wild lies that Bersih 3.0 was a coup d'état attempt.

Odin’s return and his reclamation of the throne from Balder felt forced. The status quo was largely reset to how things were before Ragnorak, and yet some excellent new ground was cleared and seeds sown for fresh stories.

All the time I in the toilet all I could think about is I leave she sitting there with my gin, and I know I shouldn’ta leave the bottle because she was never the kind of person to spend any money on top shelf, always a Georgi kind of girl from way back in the days when we used to run around together in the clubs. Didn’t even know what to call for when was the fools paying. Always drinking Easy Jesus and Alize and all that cheap shit that will eat up your liver with cancer. Me, I have always loved Gordons what the Queen mother used to drink. But still like an idiot, I leave the whole bottle. But is not like I coulda bring it in the toilet with me. That is something she would do, pick it right up and walk out. Them was always common people, and is only because I know she from home you see me and she is still any kind of friend. Nasty, jealous people they always was. And cheap? Is my father who lend she father the suit he get married in and he bring it back without even taking it to the Chinee man laundry. Rice grain and cake crumbs Daddy say find in the pocket. Even when she children was small and she send them here to play with my Horace, she never one day send so much as a grape. Horace used to take pity and share he little snack when he tired hear them beg him. Now she living in house and playing big. What don’t meet you will pass you. And watch how the bottle gone down.
Anyways, between looking at all the reminders of my childhood and being there with Nicole, I kind of forgot that I'm a grown-up now...or at least as grown-up as you're supposed to be at nineteen. I ran around the store looking at all of the toys and books, and remembering my elementary-school friends, Shelby and Juliane, and how we would play for hours and hours with our American Girl dolls. I've been feeling pretty nostalgic lately, so going to this store with Nicole was just feeding the fire. Then someone asked where my daughter was, and the magic was over.
Whatever it is, I am so proud of him. I wish I could have had a glimpse into these days 2 years ago. I would have worried a lot less and I wouldn't have been so hard on him, either. And I wish I had been more persistent with that unhelpful person at the College last year who told me he couldn't go there until he was 19.

The next time there's an older movie on, listen to what's going on in the background, without watching the screne.
While writing this, I thought about how the word “selfish” is associated with pride. What’s wrong with us putting someone else first? What’s wrong with esteeming another brother or sister in the Body higher than ourselves? If we do that, is it saying that we are less than they are? No, it’s not.
Today's main task was to deliver a stack of my books to the Luna, an inflatable pod thing in the Market Terrace. It was a slightly surreal experience to see copies of it alongside other books, but hopefully people browsing the stall will be sufficiently intrigued to pick up a copy.

I am not saying we should not strive to present our work in the best possible light. The point I am attempting to make is there comes a point when you have to quite quibbling over minutia and let it go; warts and all.
We traveled with BAIR workers towards a local DLS facility/store. It was there that the manager met us and showed us how the potatoes that are the positive selected variety are kept in order to use for next season’s crop. The DLS facilities allow the potatoes to be stored in shelves, one layer thick, so that the sprouts used for germination are healthy.

there are two answers to that question. As for how long it took me to write it, the answer is only about three months. But I’d already “written” the whole story in my head over the course of the previous year. When I imagine up stories for my own enjoyment, I “watch” them in words rather than pictures. So, while I don’t have a photographic memory or anything like that, I’d “read” the story so many times in my head over that year that the process of writing it

When I saw the movie trailer for I Am Number Four, and learned that there was a book of course I had to read the book first! Obviously I liked the book better but I just haven’t picked up the sequel yet. Hopefully this summer :)

Paper book in the hand, I’m reading I Shall Wear Midnight by Terry Pratchet and liking it more than any of his other books. It seems to have happened on an era of complete realism which makes it darker but recognisable because it’s sinking down into a fearsome part of our history.
All you need are some birthday candles, something to hold them up, such as modeling clay or "Floam," and a lighter. You'll also need a pair of scissors to cut one of the candles down to the end, otherwise you'll have to let your class sit and watch for a good long time while that last candle burns completely out! I cut mine down to about half an inch, and even that took a good four minutes to burn completely out, so if your class' attention span is short, then cut it the shorter the better! Then get a glass jar and remove the label so that everyone can see what is happening inside of it, and a glass of water. Also, be sure to keep a fire extinguisher and a bowl of water handy, just to be on the safe side!
It will be quite a while before we visit with our psychotic backwoods friends again, for now we get to meet the Rat Pack of Wolfbreath College: three women all around thirty, who were thick as thick can be back in the day, defending one another from terrible boyfriends, domineering parents, and general boredom: Trina (Tiana Pierce), who lives in Beverly Hills and is some undefined way one of the beautiful people always giving and attending parties and generally being seen with and by important cinema folks (she is introduced at a party scene full of vapid Hollywood "deep" types that recalls, though it obviously does not match, the L.A. sequence of Annie Hall); Abbey (Nancy Hendrickson), living in cramped Chicago apartment with her unspeakably cruel hypochondriac mother; and Jackie (Deborah Luce), a New Yorker who makes the most spectacularly bad choices about men you could imagine. Once a year, these three women get together to go on mystery trips, in which only one member of the trio knows where they're headed or what they're doing there until they've arrived. This year, it's Jackie's turn, and she wants go go on a camping trip in the New Jersey woods. First, of course, they have to pass by a creepy convenience store manager (Scott Lucas), who warns them to stay away from Barons Wilderness. Though after they manage to destroy his shop, he's a lot less concerned with sending them off to their demise.
“There are literally thousands of conservation and research projects waiting to happen and as many scientists wanting to get out to sea,” said Sean Dooley, co-founder of OPA. “The logistics for them to do so usually involves months of grant applications, scheduling and politicking. OPA offer them a path that cuts through all of that, and the yacht’s owner, family and guests end up having access to world-class projects and people as a result.”
Everybody likes zombies, right? Of course they do. Who wouldn't? But, do they have enough drive to keep an entire publishing company alive. That's what The Library of the Living Dead is counting on. It was on one of my bi annual trips to a convention called Cinema Wasteland where I ran into the people behind this concept. I asked the guy behind the table to give me his best book. It was a novel called Dead Tide which I have just started. Too soon for an opinion. I also caught the cover of Zombology and I liked the word. I also like short, zombie fiction so I took a shot.

My favorite stamp company, Flourishes are having challenges galore, lately and I want to join in everyone of them, but it's overwhelming me :) So I made a card that would conquer at least two of their challenges. My problem being, is that one of them, is Warm Winter Wishes challenge. The challenge being that we are challenged to use Blue on your holiday card... I do not understand why, but anything blue stumps me. I mean I was utterly perplexed with this one! But since I love a good challenge that stumps me, I forged ahead and did my best :)

For the next several hours, we worked our way toward a better tactical position. We’d be making good progress, then have to turn back to avoid a fishing boat and lose ground. Santa Fe was operating at periscope depth in shallow water, so each turn took several minutes. It was slow going.
Things NOT to do:
I have also been learning new words:
Instead, to honor a child’s birthday, parents could make a donation to the school’s library in the kid’s name or they could pass out school supplies (i.e., erasers, rules, pencils) to the other members of the class.
Where to even begin? An album so overstuffed with ideas it constantly seems on the verge of descending into self-parody (as the band would later do with The Hazards of Love), yet The Decemberists maintain a sense of humor about the whole affair that keeps even the darker songs like "On the Bus Mall" from being too serious. Colin Meloy's nasal voice also aids in keeping a sense of lightness that strongly benefits tracks such as "The Sporting Life," about a guy who just isn't that good at sports and prevents the playful musical tone of "16 Military Wives" from contrasting too sharply with its dour subject matter. The highlight of the record is the nearly nine-minute "Mariner's Revenge Song," where all of their gifts at wordplay and habit of writing songs about the ocean and the people who go out on it culminate in the greatest song they've ever written, recorded live around a single microphone, the band members stepping closer when their part came up.

Globalization in China, (maybe) Globalization in other countries, and a post of some excerpts from a paper I’ve read. Then I may have a post of a book I’ve been reading and how it changed that areas (the country) in general. Or how you believe it to have changed the area/country even.
For example, Jesus is the Saviour of the World, but He doesn’t become MY Saviour until I admit that I need a Saviour and ask Him personally into my life. In Hebrews. Jesus is described as the new and living way into the presence of God. But I can’t come into the presence of God until I enter into that new and living way through Jesus. There is no other way. Christ died for the sins of the whole world, but I am forgiven of nothing until I ask Christ to be my sin-bearer and personal Saviour. Christ has offered to share with us His love, His joy and His peace, but they don’t become mine in my experience, until I receive Him, and open myself to receive these blessings in Him. God offers to answer our prayers, but we only get the answers when we pray with belief and with no doubt. “James wrote, Jas 1:6-8 “When a person asks, he must believe and not doubt…..”

I've now crossed off most things on my 26 things to do before turning 26 list (which also turned into my before 27 list). And so, a new list for this new year of life...couldn't quite get to 28 but I'm sure I will think of more as the year goes on:
But do they ever ask?
I love The Miz and R-Truth as a team, but there is no heat at all on this match they have with Air Boom this Sunday. And what does that say about David Otunga and Michael McGillicutty losing to random people every week with Jerry “The King” Lawler?

This video brings up many different possible discussion topics, which I plan on using as other blog posts sometime in the 4th quarter of 2015. But in this particular blog will focus on the probability of life, not the probability of life existing, but how our lives are made of probabilities.

I could just about kick myself for not opening this cookbook sooner. I received it as a Christmas gift this past year and for some reason – maybe it was the chicken dish on the cover that spoke more of fall than spring or that it seemed complicated because it was, after all, french – it got put away on a shelf and stayed there.
You know, or you have a strong feeling of knowing what your child would have looked like, and been like. You see a child in the store, or on the street. Their hair color, dimples, smile, their personality and suddenly you are reminded of your child. You miss your child even more, if that’s even possible.
Whilst past Comic Relief specials have been a bit humorous, in this episode and the one that follows we get a proper trope of laughs. Using the TARDIS set as an opportunity for Rory to look up Amy's skirt is sheer brilliance. Oh and we end on another back reference.

Don't get me wrong... I have a lot of nice cards and some of them are just too good to stick away in the card catalog. Since I'm still working on the Cave I won't show it off at all but I do have a couple of interesting things on the walls already that I'd like to share in case anyone else gets inspired.
As I mentioned Monday, I wanted to make sure I got you all some preliminary info on what we want to do for a small follow-up to our first Mission.
The birth of my eldest daughter, Keira, inspired me to finally get serious about my writing and get something done. But both (soon to be three) of my daughters inspire me to write everyday.
Lynda Barry's mind, as expressed in this video and her various works, ought to be declared a national treasure. That she is aware of the mind, generally, as a pearl of great price makes me feel as though I just woke up from a mediocrity-induced coma. It is not just what she says, but the uniquely plain-spoken AND sort of revolutionary way she says it. Poetry traveling to us through time. My embarrassingly low-brow response is, Duh.

Looking back at the tropes of Sword-And-Sorcery, I can now understand why I was so attracted to the stories, even more than the “High Fantasy” of Tolkien. I lived in a dystopian world (and I continue to), wherein slavery, exploitation, repression, and the gritty, grisly horrors of war were realities. Conan faced these issues – and overcame them – with his wits, his iron will…and a Big-Ass Sword. Something I would have loved to do, had I been able to…or had I believed I was able to, but I only read about Caucasians saving the day.
Picking the Boomerocity short list of favorites is difficult. In the battle for first is Gabriel's treatment of Paul Simon's The Boy in the Bubble. As he did on the Scratch My Back album, Peter dials this back a few beats per second as compared to Simon's original. In a live setting with full orchestra, it really does have a spine tingling effect.
So it's Friday. I never cease to be amazed how quickly weeks can pass by without one noticing. The ways we percieve and reflect on time present, past and future are endlessly fascinating. Viewed from Friday, a week may seem to have flown by, even if days during the week seemed to drag at the time.

The family filtered out to enjoy the beautiful evening, and saw me playing with said doggie just as it began gnawing on my fingers until they were red and scratched to pieces! I had meant to say, "Oh my, she's a viscous little girl!" and ended up saying the equivalent of:

Derrek calmed slightly when he saw her level expression. She wasn’t casting a judging stare his way; it was an expression full of sensibility with a hint of comfort. “Are you all right? Are you sure you didn’t land on your head or something?”
The poets were an odd lot, easily given to maudlin sentiment, while fiction writers fell by turn to the mimicry of suburban prose, the K-Mart fiction of drunks, hypochondriacs, used-car salesmen, and adulterous wives that populated the fictional worlds of Ray Carver, Anne Tyler, Bobbie Ann Mason, or John Updike. I had read too much of it all, with its facile repetitions of brand names and parking-lot angst. And the poets, with their gnashing and wailing about poor dead John Berryman (a suicide) or the sad Montana taverns of Richard Hugo just seemed a bit over the top for me. I trusted neither.
We decided at the very beginning of our day that there would be no video tapes or pictures and I really wish we would of filmed this. Once we all were piled into the pool we slowly started running and smashing into the sides of the pool to get it moving. Once it started sliding down the hill Phil realized that we were directly lined up with the tree. We couldn't see the pool before because the walls were so high but once we were heading downhill things became quite clear very quickly. We all tried to abandon ship but every time anyone tried to get up they fell back down because they were so drunk. We all seemed to realize at once how screwed we really were. Everyone was screaming by this point and Mark was even trying to pop the pool with his teeth to escape. As we smashed into the tree at full speed about 3 people flew out of the pool and went about 20 feet ahead into the shallow snow. Everyone else smashed into the side of the pool and I was on the second layer.
However, another Lantean, named Zordon, was in orbit around Earth in a modified ship of his own when Rita dropped out of hyperspace. After a brief exchange, Rita fired on Zordon’s ship. Zordon (who had known Rita before the evacuation of Atlantis) expected the attack, and was able to activate a device aboard his ship moments after Rita fired. As the energy field from Zordon’s device hit Rita’s ship, her modified hyperdrive, with Goa’uld safety measures overridden to allow for the upgrades to take effect, overloaded and a blast of energy rocked both ships. Rita, Goldar, and the army of Putties were thrown into a small hyperspace window connected modified drive aboard her ship, while Zordon, due to his proximity to his device, was actually trapped in a subspace.
BM: I knew some about the Civil War but I wasn’t really familiar with Hancock. I immediately learned about him, and of course all the actors found that you really had to know your stuff because you’re dealing with all these terrific reenactors who know everything there is to be known about these things and you better know what you’re doing. I read three books on him, and Sam Elliot who had a researcher doing work for him gave me some of his research that had to do with Hancock. I found it fascinating and since we did the movie, I continued to read up on him which only later added to Gods and Generals.

If you can shed the ‘importance’ factor from your writings. If you can separate yourself from how awesome your pieces are, and how awesome you are, I promise you your writing will become very pure and real, almost angelic. The saddest thing is that once you reach that point, once everything you write becomes gilded gold on a page, you will be so humble that you won’t even notice it. You will just cast it into the pile of gold you have been recording your whole life and write another wondrous piece.

Yet, as attested by his final vote tally, Roh Tae-Woo administration was a lame duck from the start. In order to break through the weakness, Roh engineered a game-changer: Roh's Democratic Justice Party would merge with two opposition parties, one of which was Unification Democratic Party led by Kim Young-Sam. The result of this "Three Party Merger" was Democratic Freedom Party, which is the precursor to the current-day New Frontier Party. In 1992, on the back of the merged parties, Kim Young-Sam became the president.

I used the "swiss dots" embossing folder to emboss the inner ears on this one. I didn't add "buttons" to the vest, I created a vest with the "buttons" cut out.(My file contains both vests, one with the circles cut out and one plain.) I pop dotted the nose and the paw holding the flower. My sample card appears to have his left arm (paw) "bent" behind him but there is an extra arm to add on that side if desired. This card used 15mm goggle eyes with lashes. Yesterday's card the eyes were 10mm. I had previously tried 10mm size with lashes when I made my first one but didn't like it for some reason. I do think with the larger eyes it works.
