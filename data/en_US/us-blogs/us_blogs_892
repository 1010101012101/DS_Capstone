One error in judgment had cost Moody her license to practice. When conventional ADHD treatments had not helped eight-year old Chad Monroe, in a moment of self-doubt and slight panic Moody had opted for a new-age radical binding technique.
...and then the tofu leaked out of the top of the tofu through a little crack. Both times. But hey, they still look like fried eggs, and there's sure to still be some filling inside the tofu. So I proceeded to fry them up.
Another negative thing was that some of the prices are up there. My shrimp and grits were $18. I don't know if they have a choice, since there were a lot of shrimp in that puppy. The good thing is that it was as rich as all get out (we literally went walking around a mountainside afterwards to work it off), and you could easily share it with someone, add a side of cornbread, and you're good. We ended up bringing almost all the gumbo home.

I panicked so I decided to direct the bike towards the veranda. I thought, I’ll just crash into something. It will hurt, but it will be better than colliding with snakes. I slammed into the cement benches of the veranda. The edge of the bench hit my leg, and scraped a good deal of flesh. It hit the lower part of my leg, the front part, the part where the bone connected to my knee. I looked at the wound, and I saw that it was white. The edge took away the flesh leaving only bone.

Not being anywhere near this amazing sandwich, I decided to make a version at home. And schnikes, it was a perfect combo. My ingredients obviously aren't as fresh, so I imagine adding the likes of homemade pizza rolls or pesto would really knock it out of the park. My lazy self went with these options:

SUMMER SUNDAE festival-Leicester
Ratner has promised 600 to 1000 affordable for-sale units, on or offsite, though the plans released last week give no indication that they would be onsite. If the developer builds the maximum 1000 affordable condos offsite, that would make 41.3% of the entire project's residential units affordable. If 600 units were built, the percentage would be 38.2%. That's not 50 percent.

By giving ourselves positive and patient feedback, we can then pass that on to others. It can give us the pre-disposition to diffuse conflict instead of stir it up.

There, I said it. That dirty photography word, HDR. “Stone him” I hear you all cry. But wait! Why not? I’ve hardly used HDR for the last 18 months but the last couple of days it’s been a useful style to adopt. HDR is really down to personal taste but if done tastefully then I can’t see any reason why not? A bad shot will still look like a pile of poo in HDR but a good shot can look particularly pleasing if done properly.

There is an expression in political circles that “a week is a lifetime”. By that pundits mean things can happen quickly and change drastically. Sometimes overnight. It’s been a week since I last posted here and yes, a lot has happened.
Mrs. Obama shook hands and posed for photos with luncheon attendees for about twenty minutes before departing for her fundraiser with Buffett. He introduced the First Lady to a crowd gathered at the Hilton Omaha Hotel. Mrs. Obama ticked off her husband's achievements while in office, and urged the group to stay committed to the cause.

*A Happy Dance is one where the dancer in question takes their pointer fingers on both their left and right hands and points them into the air. Moving their adjacent elbows around frantically. What said dancer does with their feet is up to that particular person. However, we at DeLibrarie suggest somewhat of a dancy hop from one foot to the other... sort of what you would picture a lephrachan doing. :)
But the gifts of God to man are rough gifts. They are looked upon with envy and allow humans a power that they can’t control. They open the repressed creativity and gifts of people that have repressed them. For this reason, when looking to Edward Scissorhands, we also think of Freud’s Civilization and its Discontents, civilization paying the price for its own power. At the moment that the community is at its flourishing, its hedges spectacular and its hairstyles on the cutting edge, that it becomes capable of its most horrible acts. It represses and kills again that which it revived in itself. Remember, modernism was at its ultimate power and optimism for the future when it created two world wars and the holocaust.
Oh, I could go on and on with how we also get a great street-level villain in the gun-toting murderer Boddicker as essayed by Kurtwood Smith. He makes it look easy, as a man who finds himself in his element blasting holes in cops and overseeing huge explosions, not to mention flinging useless cohorts out of moving vehicles. Paul McCrane is also very good as Emil, a twisted little piece of work who more than meets his match and, just like Ferrer, leaves the film in grand fashion.

I'm trying really hard to distract myself from thinking about the class. I have a baby shower to go to this weekend and the weekend after the dreaded class we're going to a family BBQ. This weekend is Mothers Day and I need to figure out what to get my Mom and Mother-in-law. Shopping trip! So I'm trying to focus on those fun things instead of the class. It's not really working but I'm pretending it does.
Aside from couch surfing, two of my favorite things about Vienna were the Easter Market (Ostermarkt) and the Easter Vigil Mass that we attended at St. Stephan’s Cathedral. The easter market was SO overwhelmingly cool – there was so much to see and hear and eat; it was absolutely wonderful. Probably the most interesting part was that there were thousands upon thousands of intricately painted easter eggs for sale in the middle of the market. I took tons of pictures, but here’s one I particularly enjoyed:
So throughout our supper, between my goat cheese and honey rocket salad and peppery yet creamy Portuguese chicken livers, I pondered the three Chinese guys standing outside, through the window in the front garden.

I don’t care for birthdays, never have. There are a lot of reasons. I suppose some self-analysis is in order or possibly it’s an avenue to pursue in therapy. There have been times over the last week that I just wished I could have avoided the day and come out all fresh the following morning. But the day is here and that is not happening. I am stuck being another year older. I didn’t even get to celebrate the final moments of the previous year. Rather than revel in the last bit of youth, I was fast asleep way too early because I am seriously old.

Kentucky woman (Neil Diamond)
The Bell Jar by Syliva Plath tells the story of Esther as she descends into the depths of mental illness. Esther starts her story during a stint as an intern at a popular woman’s magazine. She is a young and intelligent, but also a little lost. She doesn’t click with any of the women who are part of the intern group, nor does she seem to fit into the accepted boundaries of society in the 1960s. Esther doesn’t buy into the idea of marriage or the so-called “duties” that were expected of women at the time. The idea of being submissive clashes with her headstrong ideals and she refuses to play the game of accepted male/female roles. Most of her qualms concerning men and relationships has to do with the double standard that exists in terms of purity. The hypocrisy of the fact that men can go out and sleep with whoever with little consequence, while woman are expected to stay “clean” aggravates her.

people they knew in the company. Eric met with each of them, and asked them in turn to identify the 10 smartest people they knew. In a few weeks, Eric had a list of 100 engineers he considered critical to Novell’s future. He met with each of them personally, encouraging them to take chances and follow their instincts. He removed the possibility of reprisals by their managers for voicing their opinions. This inspired the engineers and focused their efforts, resulting in innovative and improved products. These changes helped Novell transform itself from a loss of $78
this is such a fun way to add a little bit of fun to your makeup, i love the orange trend this season and I'm yet to purchase my statement purple lipstick. i recommend that you all purchase a bold lip colour (not red) in a shade that suits your skin tone and work it during the day! and for those who are at a schools that wont allow bold lipsticks, try it in lipgloss form or after school.
Focus on action. Years ago I got a rejection that said, “Your characters are terrific and I love the setting, but not enough happens.” A simple and useful critique! Bring action forward in your story; get it going quick. This is why agents and editors tell you to start your story in the middle: They’ve seen too many Chapter Ones bogged down by backstory. Put your backstory in the back, not the front. Readers will stick with you if you give them something juicy right away. I make a point of opening each of my Rita Farmer novels with a violent scene, which is then revealed to be an audition, or a film shoot or a rehearsal. Right away, the reader gets complexity, layers and a surprise shift of frame of reference.

Seasonal Caprice
So we're officially looking for a new house now. I'm nervous and excited - nervous about the house that I currently own and am upside down in, but excited to finally be out of our tiny house. It's going to be a very busy summer, but I'm so thankful that we're able to do the things we want to do.
Our grave-rest is very far to seek.
John always came after Tom because he cared. He would understand. He cared about Tom, so he would understand if he were to call him. Tom thumped his fingers along the edge of desk. What would he say? It was never this hard to call John. John was always upfront about his emotions. Tom could read him better than any book. A lab report wouldn’t come between them, would it? Tom glared at the aforementioned document. If he just told him… he was sure John would understand. John always understood him.
In the absence of Mad Men, I enjoyed Hugo Blick's bleak The Shadow Line, with its who's who of British acting talent, and of course The Apprentice and Strictly continued to provide vicarious thrills (and just how big was Mohammed's "David Byrne" suit in Junior Apprentice? Are we sure he was 16? Did anyone check his birth certificate? He looked and acted about 12). The Killing was alright, but I'm not sure it justified the 20 hours of my life it took to get to its conclusion. And am I the only person who thinks the Danish police methods (albeit fictional) leave a lot to be desired? I got the feeling that once Lund had placed everyone in Copenhagen under arrest (and she'd certainly arrested a fair few suspects before releasing them uncharged in the first 18 weeks of the show), she'd get the right one eventually. If British police arrested and released a dozen suspects for a crime before eventually, by a process of elimination, settling on the right one, I rather thank they'd be facing a public enquiry rather than awards and acclaim in the broadsheets' arts pages.
Matteo "The Very Hungry" Yazge
I vividly remember the first time I really, truly understood that my choices and actions had consequences. I had gotten a (very) small part in a (very) small play in high school. Rehearsal was after school and I left campus to go get an after school snack or smoke a cigarette or do whatever else I was inclined to do in those days. I went back to school for rehearsal and moseyed in about 5 minutes late. The director promptly fired me and gave my part to someone else. I remember thinking that it seemed so unfair. I wasn't very late - certainly not any later than I often showed up to his class. I really wanted the part. I would never be late to a rehearsal again. I would never be late anywhere again. I couldn't lose the part because I was 5 minutes late! At that very moment, I knew that none of those arguments and no amount of pleading could change one simple fact - I knew the rules and I chose not to follow them. So I kept my mouth shut, walked out and learned a very valuable lesson.

Sunflower seeds are a fantastic boredom food. Besides the fact they're loaded with Vitamin E (which in short means they protect against free radicals, among other things), they are rich with specific anti-oxidants in charge of lowering blood sugar levels, as well as protein to satisfy that little bit of hunger you may or may not be experiencing.

There is no need to explain what this does! Obviously, if the power goes out you won’t be able to use your electric can opener and would need a manual. Also if you can’t afford a high electric bill and need to cut down on use all together here is just one small way you can save some. I would actually keep a couple on hand because I know mine gets dual after about a year, and I have to replace it. I like the cheaper ones better than the expensive ones. Sure they rust, and but they always seem to out last the nice fancy ones. I have no clue why!!
Seeing how the Babylonian account have so much extra material interwoven, I would imagine that this account is a later than the Palestinian, wanting to tell what the Palestinian account is leaving out and explain what was going on. The parable about the “ones below” and the “ones above” becomes much more concrete in the Babylonian account, while the question on why God would let him die, when righteous men are praying for him also is being answered. R. Yehudah HaNasi is also elevated to a higher status in the Babylonian account that in the Palestinian one, concluded on the context of the narratives, though the Palestinian account in no way gives the impression that it was “just a rabbi” who died here, highlighted by the response to the news of his death.

The beach was empty.
Intelligences: The state of spirits before their spirit birth. Although no church leader knows what intelligences are, they have existed forever and are coeternal with God.
The following paragraph was sourced from farmitracker, who were one of the first online media sites to report the incident after receiving verification from a SA Police spokesman at Griekwastad:
“So how do we spot the future—and how might you? The seven rules that follow are not a bad place to start. They are the principles that underlie many of our contemporary innovations. Odds are that any story in our pages, any idea we deem potentially transformative, any trend we think has legs, draws on one or more of these core principles. They have played a major part in creating the world we see today. And they’ll be the forces behind the world we’ll be living in tomorrow.”
After my mothers second divorce, I was left wondering what a marriage was supposed to be? What was a real father? Would I have one? Would I ever know what to expect? I have never, and will never blame my mother for the choices that she made, the men she married, or the bullshit she delt with. I know that love is a powerful thing, and sometimes people turn into someone you never expected they could be. Instead I admire my mom. She always had the strength to see a way out, and to continue pushing on for us kids.
After this my team got our packet and 3 horses were listed on it. I was given the most advanced of the three which was perfectly fine with me. As a bonus that horse was a big Irish Draught (YES! I scored a big horse!) AND a mare! Double bonus! I went to the barn she was in to find her. She was drop dead gorgeous. Her name is Highfield, she is a 14 year old Irish Draught mare that has also been steeple chased.

“It was privately commissioned, not published”. Eric says. “It was commissioned by ABC. It was an interesting time, because nobody else has two anchors on one desk.” It is an interesting package, when opened contains a collection of short essays “Sharing the News – Friendly Teamness: Teeming Friendliness”; “The TV public is actor”; “TV is the matrix of ecology”; “Fact and fiction in news reporting”; “What is the meaning of this”; “What has happened”; “I as the witness”; “In TV news everything is background in depth: In the press the story is up front while the girl behind the guy behind the gun is real dirt – i.e. muck-raking”; You cannot commit TV alone – yeah team!”; Friendly teamness suggests audience as part of the game”; “Are sports good news?

The train ride itself was a lot of fun for me. It is about a four hour ride from start to finish. We were on the Vistadome, which is the midrange train, for the ride there. (We'll be taking the Expedition, the cheaper train, on the way back.) It was a nice, clean train... I daresay much nicer than the inside of an airplane. The seats were plush and there were windows on the sides of the roof of the Vistadome (hence the name) so you can see the tops of the mountains on the ride. They announced points of interest and sites in both Spanish and English as we went along and played soft, pleasant Peruvian flute music for the duration of the trip. They even served a snack midway through the trip... quinoa (local to Peru) with diced carrots and zuchinni, small Peruvian potatoes in the yummy green sauce I have yet to learn the name of with Andean cheese, and small sweet unidentified little shortbread-esque cookies. It was served in the most adorable little blue and yellow basket to top it off.

We couldn`t be happier with how smoothly it all went and the great reception we got from everyone.

The theme chosen for the next Joint Conference in Pietermaritzburg could be seen as a follow up to all of these issues. It is quite amazing that migration has not really been identified yet as a major challenge to Christian mission and theological education in Africa. In a real sense therefore, the ETE-SAMS Conference in the Joint Conference focuses on a neglected and grossly under researched area.

I must admit, my thinking has been influenced a bit by Ivan Illich's Deschooling Society. In the very first part of that book, he writes, "Rich and poor alike depend on schools and hospitals which guide their lives, form their world view, and define for them what is legitimate and what is not. Both view doctoring oneself as irresponsible, learning on one's own as unreliable, and community organization, when not paid for by those in authority, as a form of aggression or subversion. For both groups the reliance on institutional treatment renders independent accomplishment suspect."

Incredibly, very few people saw that Bernanke’s machinations were nothing more than a bailout of the banks at the taxpayer’s expense. Americans weren’t paying attention to details; they saw only the mendacious big picture painted by the mainstream media. A small minority opposed Bernanke’s reappointment, but they were a tiny voice in the din.

As McElwee visits a Confederate gravesite, his thoughts turn very inward. "It seems like I'm filming my life to have a life to film, like some sort of primitive organism that nourishes itself by somehow devouring itself, growing as it diminishes," his narration says as he looks at the markers. "I ponder the possibility that Charleen is right that filming has become the only way I can relate to women," McElwee continues. "I'm beginning to lose touch with where I really am in all of this. It's a little like looking into a mirror to see what you look like when you're not really looking at your own reflection." In a way, by accident, when Ross McElwee's girlfriend dumped him, changing the direction of both Sherman's March and McElwee's filmmaking career, McElwee evolved into the real David Holzman, the made-up filmmaker in Jim McBride's landmark 1967 mockumentary David Holzman's Diary except that McElwee isn't a parody and his sincerity ultimately powers the film's humor and success. If you like documentaries or, more importantly, unique, one-of-a-kind films, see Sherman's March which, after 25 years and multiple viewings, continues to fill me with awe, amusement and wonder every time I see it. Each time I ask myself, "How can this film possibly captivate me for 2½ hours?" I'm never certain I've settled on the correct answer to that question. I just know that Sherman's March does.
It's being positive for others, because they want you to be happy, but you really just want to say,"I'm devastated. I'm heartbroken."

If Disney is the most accommodating for persons with disabilities, the old buildings in DC are the other end of the spectrum. Now, that doesn’t mean they aren’t accessible…they are. Or that the people who work in them aren’t helpful and friendly…they are. It’s just, there is rarely a ramp or elevator close to the main entrance. Not a big deal when the weather is good, but if the weather is bad, or you have a kids who struggles with the cold…it is not a recipe for a fantastic experience. We bailed and are spending the day close to the hotel.
Next the tour took us up into Phoenix Park past the Irish President’s residence and by the Dublin Zoo.

Finding that as a thirty-year-old with much experience of romantic and sexual matters he could no longer fully identify with the attractive but naive Romeo, he amplified the role of Mercutio, giving him his own whimsical speech and attitudes, putting into his mouth as he fell from Tybalt's sword, his own thoughts as he had fallen himself in the street brawl with Knyvett's men. He also trimmed down the month of wedded bliss that he had allotted the lovers in his teens to a single night, perhaps a reflection of the all-too-brief delights of his present romance. With Mercutio suborned to reflect himself, he added Benvolio as the friend that Rutland had been to him then, and perhaps was still.
I’m not worried about getting money back from the yokels up north – it’s never going to happen. But if Greenwich and Stamford together are paying 20% of the income tax burden, it’s a fair bet that Fairfield County, with Westport, Darien and New Canaan being sucked dry too, is probably paying almost the full 100%. This is a pretty perilous way to run a state budget, I think. We don’t have to stick around to be bled, after all.
Here's the final card! I hope to see you over at the challenge this week! Can't wait to see what you make! & Thank you to all that take the time to enter every week!! we love seeing your creations!!
As a result, you have to struggle with and manage stress constantly. This stress is contributed by various means, be it trying to keep up with the pace of the day to maintaining and balancing work and personal relationships. And it’s more now days than decades ago when physical labor and simple living were prevalent. Those who have seen both times I speak of might agree with me. Today’s generation only knows what they see and experience and hence, for them stress is a part of life.
It's been months since I've written any kind of anything on here. I've thought about writing but then the thought of trying to come up with something clever to say makes my head hurt so I just put it off saying I'll do it tomorrow. So.....today is tomorrow!

Up Gregory-Ranger, down ASG with Scott. Ugh. Really easy ascent with lots of hiking and then actually a lot of hiking on the descent, too, but that was more because my shin was sore. Crazy icy conditions out there this morning. Leg felt a lot better jogging on the streets, but generally a shitty day where I was reprimanded for increasing my longest run by almost 25min yesterday. Stupid me, I can never get a break.
Americans have short memories, particularly in election years, and most seem to have forgotten that it is barely two months since President Obama stepped in to restrict the sale of the morning-after-pill -- to girls under 17 -- a move seemingly designed to reassure the increasingly suspicious, sexist American centre-right that he hates sexual freedom a

Our faith is more than a religion, a culture, a label - it is the joy of living the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It means that we may make mistakes, mess up, sin and fall but we can turn back to Him and accept the grace offered us through His death and resurrection. GK Chesterton's wonderful imagery comes to mind: "Catholic doctrine and discipline may be walls; but they are the walls of a playground." In a playground, people will have freedom - they will sometimes fall over, but their friends will help pick them up again.
Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande — if he wins the French runoff election — poses yet another threat, unless he could forget his campaign promises to blow his nation’s budget with new entitlements. A France headed back into higher subsidies, more protectionism and more voter-purchasing welfare would be a crushing blow for the European unification that Paris had done so much to sponsor since World War II.

I didn't count on becoming a homeschool parent. Homeschooling has been wonderful and I wouldn't change it. I don't have plans to stop homeschooling, though you never know what is around the corner. But certainly homeschooling for me meant that my idea of going back to school went on the back burner. Especially since my girls are very close in age - having very young children all together means lots of parent time. Over the years I've toyed with various schemes and plans for going back to school, but for one reason or another (all valid reasons I think) I didn't follow through.

A woman came out of a dark room. It was Ms. Valentini, the incredibly nice, fragile, brunet secretary at school. She wore a tight green dress that complemented her body in every demeaning way. This would explain the black eye she had at the fundraiser, and the busted lip at the annual banquet. Principal Sal was known for his temper.

It certainly would be the case that if Palestine did become an independent state with agreed borders on the 1967 Green Line, many Palestinians would still be classed as refugees, and a lot of land that was illegally taken before 1967 will remain in Israeli hands. Diana Alzeer, a young Palestinian activist from Ramallah also agrees; “I do not feel like celebrating the quest for a state on the 1967 borders. Those borders mean the loss of 70% of the land that we Palestinians call “Palestine” – the area where Palestinians lived before 1948.”

To put yesterday’s events into perspective, let us look at some unarguable facts. SIOE and Vlaams Belang are legally established movements operating within a democracy. The reason for their demonstration may not have been to the taste of our European elites, but the gradual erosion of Europe’s culture and heritage in the face of Islamic expansion is a reality nonetheless. In a democracy, a legitimate movement with legitimate concerns should be allowed to make those grievances known in a public manner.

There are a slew of things that need to be clarified about colon cleansers before you can make an informed decision. Colon cleanse is the natural process of the colon in getting rid of pathogenic elements, toxins and waste materials. It is also directly responsible for our body’s capacity in absorbing and retaining mineral salts and water while ensuring the healthy balance of electrolytes and body fluids. An impaired colon will not be able to perform this critical function in conditions where a higher level of toxins and waste materials proliferate in the body system as a result of impacted fecal matter.

If you've been reading my blog for awhile you may already be familiar with Eco-Emi. I used to write up a blog post every month for the lastest Eco-Emi Box. I loved my boxes. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my subscription do to money issues. Then a whole new group of monthly subscription services came out and I tried those. I found myself wishing that I had just stuck to Eco-Emi. With Eco-Emi you are getting what you pay for and more. As well as really great customer service. I REALLY, REALLY MISSED IT! I tried to re-subscribe only to find that there is a waiting list. :( It's ok though because I was approved for a review. Which means I can get my fix and be able to hold off a little longer. LOL.

This is one of those dangerous territories that many of us hold dear to our hearts (of course—it involves our children), and it’s so easy to feel judged for your parenting choices. But I have no judgments about how any other families handle their children’s education. I simply have ideas about what is best for me and my family. And please don’t take this as a judgment of teachers. I know I count quite a few among my readers, and I believe they perform an honorable, challenging, and severely under compensated job.

”I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower. He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit. You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing. Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.

Weight didn't become a problem for me until I got married. I'm not blaming marriage or my husband. I'm blaming myself for changing my eating habits to fit another person's dietary needs instead of listening to my body and what it was telling me. Blood tests helped us learn that our bodies metabolize sugar and fat in completely opposite ways. His risks are with sugars and mine are with cholesterol. We didn't find this out until about four years into our marriage. We didn't actually start doing anything about it until eight years into our marriage. Our unhealthy habits were beginning to affect our mood toward each other and our energy levels to do the things we love. I wish we hadn't let it get that bad before deciding we needed change, but sometimes you have to let everything go to shit so you can experience how awful it really is, before you'll get fed up and decide you need to take control and make some tough changes.

I don't know what to say... What is Russell doing calling the playing-Indian family "indigenous"? From the perspective of those who say they are "Native American" because they were born in America, but that is a snarky thing to do. It is an attempt to discredit American Indians. Same thing here, I think. Russell is intentionally (or not) being dismissive of American Indians. Then, Russell tells us that this family is being invaded by the World of Darkness. These are interesting parallels... Where is she going with this?

The largest of these boys pushed me back and I fell over one of the other boys. I dropped my knife and one of them snached it up and they all ran away laughing.” Here the boy’s anger returned, “I hate them. I hate them all.”

Friends, if you too are finding yourself in a rut take some time to draw away from the world and connect with your inner being. Find a good book to read and curl up.

You just have to take that chance and make it into something more.
What was it my mother once said? I tap my chin and think back to my eight-year-old self. The little boy across the street had just kicked me in the shins and spit in my hair before he dashed away laughing. I limped home with tears in my eyes and bloodstains on my socks. As I bawled in my mother’s arms, I kept asking her if he would be punished for what he’d done. It only seemed fair that he should pay for being so mean. Between her gentle cooing she whispered, “Fate decides what will be and what will not somewhere between always and never.” Her answer seemed like a crock back then and life has proven to me more than once that the answer is never. The little boy is a bitter man and the little girl still cries.

You can starve them to death in their millions, as Stalin did, and as Lenin had before him. You can force them to march through the desert until they drop dead through hunger and exhaustion as was the Turks' preferred method of dispatching some one and a half million Armenians, whilst the world was distracted by the first World War. Alternatively if you wish to speed up the process you can shoot them, bomb them, gas them as Saddam Hussein did to the Kurds, or merely hack them to bits with machetes, by which means the Rwandans slaughtered 800,000 people in a mere 100 days during 1994.

I keep thinking about the whole art-and-faith conundrum. Maybe it’s not really a conundrum. I have a feeling Christians, at least, lost some of our artistic prowess when we started making art into billboards. In the Middle Ages, most art was “Christian,” but it was designed to tell stories (albeit Christian stories), not specifically to convert anyone. I’m an evangelical. I used to be a missionary. I believe in sharing my faith. What’s more, my Messiah told lots of stories with underlying meanings. I give children’s sermons. I just don’t think every single expression of art or of faith needs to be a sermon. The book I consider authoritative for life and meaning is full of stories and they don’t all have point by point, easily-delineated-on-an-easel, applications, though I believe they do have some application. I believe that ideally, the truer and more genuine both things (art and faith) are, the more winsome they will be.
After a two week planning period, it was time for General S. Musselman to send her troops into battle. Armed with a forky weeding thing in hand, and a large bucket to collect the casualties at her side, she was ready for a quick ‘how-to pull weeds’ lesson from Commander-in-Chief M. Musselman.
Canadian Plains Indians, the Innu, were moved by the Canadian government into specially built estates. They were effectively forcibly transformed into Canadians, just as Britons are being forcibly transformed into ‘citizens of the world’. Like us, the Innu are having their past erased and are being offered nothing for the future — despair has set in, as it is setting in on Britain’s sink estates. A superficial difference is that the Innu were dispossessed by a different ethnic group (Canadian globalists), whereas we are being dispossessed by our own elected representatives (British globalists). But it is the same global movement. In the young Innu, deculturalisation manifests in drug and alcohol abuse and petty crime.
Y'all remember we bought a real fixer upper, right? That's putting it mildly. We're pretty much gutting and rebuilding each room as we go. So far, we're about 1/2 way done.

I'll post some before/after pics once we put the finishing touches on the "done" rooms.

have always been drawn to anything that involves creative thinking. I enjoyed sketching as a child and was eventually drawn to music. In school, the structure and process of writing reports always made more sense to me than mathematics and the sciences, and I suppose that skill translated a bit into storytelling. I recall, at age five, drawing characters with bubbles above their heads. The bubbles had scribbles inside, and I made a habit of going from adult to adult telling the story/dialogue that was written within the bubbles. Of course, the story was always much more elaborate than what could possibly be written in the small bubble, and the story always changed, but I consider that to be the age when I started writing. If that doesn’t count, then I suppose I started in fourth grade when I wrote a story about popcorn characters. I do not remember how the story went exactly, but recall that one of the characters was named Colonel (which I spelled “Kernel”) Caramel Corn.

I love photography. I take photos every chance I get. I can go to the zoo to take photos and come back three hours later with 200 photos. I have been doing it for a while now. Recently I noticed the more often you take photos the better at it you get. Chaske Spencer is awesome. It is so fun meeting him. He is amazing. I can’t wait to see more of his movies and hear about all of his adventures. He deserves it.

Earlier I was touched by the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan speech when he addressed members of his AKP party in parliament, appealing to Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president: "You have to listen to the wishes of the people in order to create security and stability. First you must take steps that are good for Egypt. You must take steps that satisfy the people.Everyone has the right to fight for freedom, but without violence.You must not forget that the people who oppose you are still human, still your brothers."said the Turkish PM. In what he said was both a warning and piece of advice for Mubarak, Erdogan said, “We are all passing, and we will be judged by what we left behind.”
“It seems his daughter, Isabella, fancied a young man of very modest means. She was all he had after the death of Mrs. Baines in–what’s the chart say?–yes, in 1889, by the Russian flu. He was determined to arrange a suitor for her that matched his aspirations for her future. But, as it always does, love had other plans.”
Good grief.
i do remember having a really fun time that day. i can't believe how long ago it was and how quickly time goes by. this is why i love photos. a memory like this would not be retrieved quite so easily without the photo that helped to preserve it.

How do you co-parent separately with someone you couldn't co-parent together with? Good question, right? We could do what we each please, fight like cats and dogs and blame each other when something goes wrong, or we could learn to communicate with each other, collaborate on details and work together. I don't think either of those will work for us. There has to be some middle ground somewhere that we can reach. There are going to be fights, there are going to be misunderstandings; that happens in the best of relationships and yes, this is still a relationship. It is just an evolving relationship. We are no longer best friends, in fact I don't think either of us would call the other friend at this moment in time. The fact remains, though, that we need to find a way to work together. We each need to learn to give to the other and think of the kids first.

We all know that the Tea Party is not a monolithic national movement. It is divided between three major organizations, in which thousands of local Tea Parties enjoy considerable autonomy. It is difficult to get such a diverse movement to coalesce nationally around a single platform or candidate (though it is possible at the state level, as Ohio's Tea Parties, through the Ohio Liberty Council, demonstrated with Issue 3's nullification of mandatory health insurance last November).
Just because the Dev Alpha is a touchscreen phone doesn’t mean BlackBerry 10 devices won’t have physical keyboards; we expect to see at least a slider model, because the keyboard has always been a BlackBerry highlight, and the PlayBook OS can already suppress the onscreen letters when you attach the Mini Keyboard case.

Then on the far end of the ripped spectrum you have professional body builders like Lou Ferrigno, the original Incredible Hulk. He is incredibly ripped (likely down in the 2% body fat range) and very muscular. Yet the build and body composition isn’t ideal for athletic performance. When body builders make it on stage for their performance, they are actually at their weakest because they have gone through a period of excessive dehydration and fasting in order to optimize the ripped look. This is not the ideal athletic build if you still want to have a performance-based build.

Think about this: it was not long ago in our history that many women had no more freedom to choose a husband than children do to choose their parents. A woman went straight from having to obey her parents to having to obey her husband. I'm sure many "wouldn't dare say no or talk back" to their husbands. And these women "dealt with it," but that doesn't mean it was ideal. Women did not matter. Their needs, desires, opinions did not matter. And there are some places in the modern world where they still don't.

It is interesting to note that in the Q interview, the band state that 'the tourists' are the worst thing about Iceland's economic collapse, that there have never been more, due to the failed króna, and that these tourists are the only people that bother the band for autographs.

The first album I got my paws on was Ten. Everything on this album was basically giving a voice to a generation. My generation. Speaking to youth that was not represented at that time in the media. All of a sudden the disaffected kids who weren't buying into the 'yellow brick road' route, had a group of musicians who articulated their feelings through music. It was a soundtrack to life. It was the soundtrack to my life. Which sounds hokey. But, literally, played in my headphones on the daily. Soothed the disconnected feelings I felt and in turn made me feel a little less disconnected. Songs like: Deep, Black, Jeremy, Release - these songs cannot be replicated. Cannot be duplicated. It's pretty much a Blade Runner type situation for me. As I have followed their career over twenty years, at times, they were the water that filled the space between the pebbles of my mind. Flowing in between, sometimes taking up more space than before and sometimes less. A relationship.

Well, it’s official. Black Ops 2 has gone from being “Cold War-fare (hehe, pun) to “Future Warfare”. And from the looks of it, it may turn out to be some interesting stuff. Treyarch has always been noticeably superior to Infinity Ward in terms of narrative. Despite how awesome the Modern Warfare series was, it still lacked the kind of narrative that makes the down-to-earth player think twice about the point of war.
It is now 5:29 am on Sunday and I have yet to go to sleep! Because I wanted to keep an eye on them through the night I put the blow up mattress in the living room and Nathan slept on the couch and I in the chair. About 3:30 I finally finished my school work from last week and decided to check on them before I laid down. Tenli's fever was back up to 103.7 and Alanah's was up to 101.7. I gave them both drinks, and motrin and before I knew it their fevers broke and now they are jumping around on the mattress watching veggie tales along with Evangelyne.

Number 2, 85 minute runtime. Keep in mind that this is a movie that encompasses three vastly different time periods hundreds of years apart, and the film is supposed to tell the story of how Pinhead actually dies once and for all as well as how that evil puzzle box was actually created in the first place. And it’s supposed to do that in 85 DAMN MINUTES?! How is that supposed to contain such an epic story? The only possible conclusion is that the movie is REALLY gonna suck or it’s REALLY gonna be a damn wonder of a film by someone clearly gifted beyond human conception. And if you can’t guess which one of those THIS PILE OF FELCH is, I suggest you watch the film, because you’re probably its intended audience…

One big advantage of performance-driven classrooms is that teachers have many opportunities to recognize the successes of students and in turn encourage them to repeat those successes and behaviors. Great teachers want to openly recognize what students are doing to move closer to achieving the learning targets. Recognizing and rewarding good work along the way motivates students to keep practicing until they reach the final goal.

Parting Note:
Once the van was loaded it was time to head back home. We drove back to the M1, stopped at London Gateway services for some more tea- yes, more tea- and then drove back up the M1 in convoy. just before Luton the traffic slowed to a standstill and we switched lanes, drove up the exit ramp and down the other side, saving us a good 15-20 minutes on our journey, as four lanes of traffic were funnelled down to single lane as they installed a new bridge over the motorway. When we left the motorway, we swapped around a bit and Chris drove Cozy and Lee home while I carried on to our home. I'd just made yet another cup of tea when Chris arrived back. He'd had two hours sleep since the rehearsal on Thursday night, so we got to bed at about 3.30. I was up at about lunchtime the next day, still tired from the previous day's exertions, but looking forward to tonight's show in a tiny picture postcard village near Evesham.

When Mark came in I told him I wasn’t doing good. I felt the whole anger/guilt/self harm thing going on. So I tried to stay in the moment. I thought about what I could do to try and stop it. I could leave the house, go somewhere. Quickly ruled out as the thought of just getting ready to go somewhere and then coming home knowing the patio was STILL THERE made me so mad. We decided that the best thing I could do was to stay right where I was.

Gee had to power through a troubling fourth inning in which he allowed the Rockies to come back from a 3-1 deficit and take the the lead 4-3. The first four batters of the inning all got base hits, including Todd Helton with an RBI double and Michael Cuddyer with an RBI single. Later in the frame, after Gee had recorded a couple of outs, starting pitcher Guillermo Moscosco gave Colorado the lead with a clutch RBI hit of his own.

I'll try to write more here, I suppose. We'll see how that goes. I have a tendency to be a blog camel. You know....like a sex camel. Don't know what a sex camel is? It's what I used to call my friend Val's husband because he hardly ever wanted to have sex. I'd say he was like a camel. He'd store it up for a month or so, then he'd need it again to store it up and so on. Get the idea? Well, I realized I've been a blog camel for the last 7 years or so. I'll write every single day (sometimes two or three times a day) for a week or two, and then I won't write at all for a couple of months. It's ok, though. I'm just storing it all up in my head so it can come eventually come spouting out.
Our purpose in setting up our own mail server versus using an online system (such as the one our domain-ISP provides) is not problems with our users, but problems with those that receive mail from us. We are an organization that has a few in-house folks that send e-mail to our members. The members are not users of our mail system but will have clients and providers such as AOL, Yahoo, or Verizon. For a long time when I first began working in this capacity, no problems could be examined. If a member said they didn’t get an e-mail, we couldn’t track anything along the path, nor did we get any kind of error messages from our provider’s mail servers. Setting up and operating our own mail server has solved many of those problems. They were solved because in the course of building and using the server, we had to learn all about how e-mail traverses the Internet and the standards that have come to play because of spam and phishing practices of nefarious people.
The man in the wheelchair was the politician Ron Paul, he looked & seemed a bit older to me, and I remember him talking to me about politics & other things in his usual way as I helped him use the electric lift to reach the floor; but his wheelchair flipped over once we reach the floor, and I thought that Mr. Paul was seriously injured & so I felt bad for not being able to stop it from flipping, but he was okay as I helped him up & as I picked up his wheelchair, to my surprise.

My wife and I have only made it to one of class reunions in these past 30 years. We missed our 5 year reunion in 1987. I was just wrapping up the most challenging training experience of my life when that reunion was happening. I was just weeks away from graduating from the US Navy’s Nuclear Power School in Orlando, FL and I was cramming for my finals in reactor theory, reactor chemistry, reactor physics, and reactor design principles and couldn’t get away. We missed our 10 year reunion in 1992 because I was stationed at Pearl Harbor on the USS Cavalla (SSN684). I had decided that I was getting out of the Navy and only had 6 months left to my EAOS (expiration of active obligated service). It didn’t make any sense to fly my little family of 6 to the mainland for a little vacation so close to being able to move there. We made it to the 20 year reunion in 2002. We drove straight through from Pine Bluff, AR to get there, 25 hours on the road, trading off drivers sleeping in the back seat when not driving. As we approached this year’s event it looked like it wasn’t going to happen. Nobody was advertising when or where it was going to be and no one was indicating they were in charge.

It’s frequently claimed – I’ve done so myself, I regret to say – that royalty brings a substantial amount of tourist cash into London and the rest of the country but, actually, the argument is utterly facile.

The influx is putting more and more pressure on the entire South African infrastructure which has already absorbed some 5 million destitute African immigrants over the past 5 years — and who now form more than one-tenth of the population — creating a volatile mixture of fear and resentment in all the South African towns and cities. In May, more than 60 foreign Africans were killed in an eruption of anti-immigrant violence across the country.
I've decided not to do my "Best Of" posting this year, the "Lew Bryson Awards."

The sad thing is that, as with the women's 60 meter final at the US Indoor Championships where a false start was called on Lisa Barber, the second start of the race went off without incident. And Ms Barber - who also ran under protest - got no advantage over the other athletes and finished in third position. Which based on her performances over the course of the season was where she should have finished. Unfortunately in that instance, Barber was not awarded third as her original false start was upheld - even though she got NO advantage in the final!

During this period, the character that appears in the opening section of the WIP has a new history, a better explanation for some of his behaviour and a more believable challenge. I am writing fantasy on top of ordinary people, but I know I don’t want to live in the dark ages so this will be modern and urban.

As four-piece, the group cut the monster-selling In A-Gadda-Da-Vida set later in 1968, that album staying on the U.S. album charts for more than two years, and becoming one of the largest-grossing rock albums of all time. It was also reputedly the first ever rock group album to achieve platinum status.
For those of you who don't wear stockings, tights or hold ups I decided to write about "socks" but not just any socks Trousers Socks.

We can see that the fabrication of even this first vessel challenged the industry- and vessels didn't get smaller after this but rather got much larger. Before this though let's take a look at a couple of other very early design reactor vessels. Below is the vessel from the nuclear plant built by Babcock & Wilcox for the N.S. Savannah. The illustration is from a book of official specifications for the entire powerplant.
This way you are able to go through your primary levels connected with stopping smoking but without the desires linked to them. Needless to say, reducing the strong desires isn’t generally sufficient, because there are a lot more elements to be able to give up smoking cigarettes. Hence, the laser therapy should go exceptionally well coupled with behavioral therapy that should remove the mental areas of obsession. The laser merely tackles the physical Nicotine cravings.The treatment is incredibly “clean” and has simply no side effects, just like some of the drugs men and women take to stop smoking.
I'd sit at my computer and not realize that my hand had strayed to the spot until tiny curls rained down onto my shoulders, rolled off my left arm, and patterned my white keyboard with small black coils and twists; little c's and o's not of Mac's design. Enough. Time and time again I vowed to stop. I'd stop on my birthday, or on New Years, or after the birth of my first child, my second child the first day of spring the last day of winter. I could not stop twisting my damn hair. Once, I sat watching tv and at 8:45 I vowed I wouldn't twist for 15 minutes. When I found my fingers in my hair and looked at the time, it was 8:45.

Expressed in very simple terms, early AA “quiet time” involved these elements: (1) First, a decision for Christ (often called a “complete” or “real” Surrender) which enabled one to be born-again of God’s spirit and thus become one of God’s children. (2) Study of the Bible. (3) Prayer-both group and individual. (4) Use of devotionals like The Upper Room and The Runner’s Bible. (5) Seeking God’s guidance for their lives—something He promises and can do for those who have received the gift of the Holy Spirit and have become His kids (See 1 Corinthians 12:1-13; Galatians 1:11-12; 1 Peter 4:10-11; James 1:5-8).
That was years ago. Now, I see the benefits of both writing to share with others, as well as reading what others share. In this technologically infused world, the internet offers numerous ways to connect with others. Blogs are one of these fabulous tool that can help foster friendships, strengthen and encourage others, and create community.

An interesting relic – because, quite a few names have been left untouched on the list, designating them as among quite a few no-shows that particular night. One such being a certain Chris Blackwell + 1; his first U2 show came a bit later on; at a pub in Herne Hill, the same hot night that Bob Marley had headlined his last ever UK show at Crystal Palace Bowl on a glorious summer’s afternoon.

By shifting your focus and intentions to one of mutual cooperation, things will begin to change. And one day you may find yourself and your goals and intentions outgrowing the “job relationship”. The same might also be “felt” by “your job” in which case you can both move forward to bigger things with a clear concious and gratitude for the gifts exchanged.

A little side note: This was not a stolen design idea, which can be disheartening enough, but this was 2 years of my life shared through my jewelry designs, photographing them, editing them, sharing and writing about them, photographs of my daughter, my Dad, my family, etc., and it was all lifted complete with photos, titles and all content, with no links back to the owner at all. And for what purpose? To sell "AD SENSE" ads, so that they could make money off of the readerships clicks on the ads. Tacky, I say.
So will we keep dating? Maybe. Will we live together again? Maybe. Will we break up? Maybe. Will we part ways and never speak again? Maybe. Will this all get figured out and we'll live happily ever after? Maybe. Will we each meet someone else to spend the rest of our lives with? Maybe.

We then see Richie in a suit, prosecuting the case against Frank in court. He and Frank also talk in closed chambers, as Richie wants him to give up names. Frank insists that no one will testify because he took care of Harlem. Richie tells Frank that many would testify against him because a black businessman represents progress and once he's gone things can go back to normal. Frank tells him "Normal is seeing the police right up to my house, dragging my little 12 year old cousin out, tying him to a pole, shoving a shotgun in his mouth so hard they bust his teeth, then they bust two shotgun shells in his head and knock his fucking head off." He mentions the possibility of Richie getting his head blown off, but Richie just tells him to get in line. Realizing neither bribery or threats will affect Richie, he agrees to name names. Richie tells him if he lies about one name, he'll never get out of prison. Frank doesn't believe that Richie wants the names of police officers but Richie assures him that he wants them all.

For my birthday this last April - I decided I deserved something special. Something to make my life easier. SO - I went to CosmoProf (a wholesale store for licensed beauty technicians - thank you Jamie for hooking me up) I bought myself a GHD flat iron. I had previously had a CHI and I have to be honest - it wasn't that great. I brought my new GHD home and carefully plugged it in. I am not sure I have ever owned anything that expensive (except for maybe my wedding ring - it is real right Jason? :0) I was giddy as the plates ran through my stubborn waves straightening them like a pancake in half the time it had taken my CHI. I concluded it was definately worth the $150.00 I begrudgingly forked over for it.
Of course you want your book in categories that make sense for it. Of course I'm going to use one of my books as an example ;o).

I say take the negative energy they send, and use it positively by giving God the praises where you stand because you have something the enemy wants inside you or envy. Because you are the child of a King who conquered Satan at His best. I will not embrace negativity with vengeance, belittling or sarcasm, especially when someone is displaying love. It is amazing when you love others and display that love, they return it with bitterness. They are the type of people who smile on the outside, and despise you on the inside. They are not being real. They cater to your misery and pain.

Jack and Jill have a young family and have recently purchased a new home. They recognize the need for more life insurance. Jack owns a $25,000 whole life policy that his parents purchased for him as a child. The policy now has $5,229 in cash value. Jack is 34 and in a preferred rate classification. You can show him how to leverage that $5,229 into a policy with $350,000 of death benefit and, by using a 1035 exchange for a 20-year term/UL, there will be no additional premiums!
Mineral oil is not easily absorbed into your skin (it has nothing your skin needs) so it sits on top of your skin. Many experts will say that this is more of a moisturizing effect since it does not let any moisture escape your skin. This may be true, but it also does not let your skin breathe, or absorb any more moisture. I’d find that products with mineral oil (specifically my Shesido eye cream) looked like they were moisturizing on the surface, because it was forming a shiny, oily layer on top of my skin. Underneath it was really drying out my skin, so over time, my fine lines actually got worse! If I only knew!

Then Stephanie talked a bit about playing Grace, The Pirate Queen and how much she loved the story. The creators of Riverdance actually approached Alain and Claude-Michel about creating the musical based on the life of this Irish cheiftan.

The other cool thing is what’s been happening with The Pitcher’s Mom. I love this book. Loved it when I wrote it 7 years ago, when Graham was still a ballplayer. But publishers wouldn’t take a chance on it. Said women won’t read a book about sports. I said “maybe that’s because you don’t publish any books about sports from the woman’s perspective.” Deaf ears. With the advent of e-books, this all changed. No longer did I have to wait for a publisher to pay me an advance (as they had with Baptism by Fire) and put the book out for me. I could do it myself. Which I did six weeks ago. Taught myself everything I needed to know in between readings about Constantine and Corinth. I guess you could say God gave me a nudge: hey, baseball season’s coming up, why don’t you get that book out and offer it on Kindle. Let’s see what happens.C’mon, it’ll be good.

The first thing that struck me was that I was losing the social support of other parents. This was were I got to meet Stefanie face to face, and Antonella, it's where we met Romu, Dawn and Derek, Rabba, also Meredith and Chris, and other parents! This is something that is important and can't be replaced with online chats or forums. I brought this up to the manager, and so did another father. The manager had some suggestions about who we could contact to continue in the role of a social parent support group. That part made me feel a bit better - not much, but a bit.

When we were about to leave this pagoda I saw a group of people with white cloth bands around their heads which I thought was really weird. So, I asked the girl who brought me here “why do they have white things on their head?” She explained to me how they had just left a funeral service at the pagoda and the white bands showed that these people were mourning. I couldn’t believe that I had missed a Buddhist funeral service in Ho Chi Minh City by mere minutes. By time we got to the other side of the pagoda where the people with white headbands were, most of them had left. It kind of sucks that I didn’t get to talk to any of them, and it kind of sucks that the funeral had just finished, but the pagoda was still amazing.

Article 153 visibly states that it is the King’s responsibility “to safeguard the special position of the Malays and natives of any of the States of Sabah and Sarawak and the legitimate interests of other communities in accordance with the provisions of this Article”. Sadly, some racial zealots are using this Article as a weapon of aggression just to score some brownie points in politics. This symptom is not boding well for the country. Malaysians in general have never questioned the special position of the Malays and natives of Sabah and Sarawak. The minorities among them only demand that their positions too be acknowledged by the majority race.

So, this is the rundown on the illnesses and diseases and other symptoms I’ve suffered with, some from childhood, some only in the past couple of years. Either way, my goal is to be free of these chains, as that is what they are. I do not wish to be disabled and dependent and if things don’t change, that is exactly where I would be in a very short time from now. Fortunately, things have already started to change and I’m working hard to keep them on that positive path to real health and healing, and a real life filled with fun with my kids while they are still young. I want to be an example for my kids as they grow older and go off to be adults in their own lives. If we change our habits now, then by the time our kids are out on their own, those habits will already be instilled in them. But I also want to be happy and healthy. We spend far too much of our time on doctors and hospitals and urgent care facilities (as this list doesn’t talk about my husband’s illnesses that keep us chained to conventional medicine) and enough is enough.

Marketing - most people we talked to at the event were just as confused as we were, as to what would be included with the price of the admission ticket. Based on event communications, we thought for the high price of admission, there would be plenty of food - with the majority of booths offering free samples, and select vendors offering food for purchase. We arrived at around 1:30pm and were extremely disappointed to find that there were only maybe 8-9 vendors that actually offered free food (bite-sized samples of Voskos greek yogurt, Kyocho fried chicken, korean pancake, calamari from Tantalum, La Brea Bakery bread and Kerrygold cheese, cake balls, curry and thai pancake, strawberry buttermilk gelato). Though we shamelessly went several rounds at each of these booths, it was definitely not enough to be filling.

As the hours passed, it became obvious that the speculation that The Action would start at the International Dateline, at 6 PM there, was in error. But all this did was cause a quick re-grouping of thought, and an insistence that Harold had never actually said that the 6 PM time there was “guaranteed.” It was speculation. Other speculation had suggested all along that MAYBE it would start at 6 PM Jerusalem time, or even midnight at the end of May 21 Jerusalem time. Which would be much later in New Zealand than 6 PM local time.
Anyhow, my home is in disarray. And I anticipate more, since a contractor will have to come in, once things are completely dry (maybe by tomorrow), and fix the drywall, baseboards, insulation and carpeting.

At this point the debt collector told me I 'had to' go to the police as this 'must be' fraud. Well, I could just imagine the reaction of the police officer who, in between calls to car accidents and incidents of domestic violence, has to listen to me complain about a phone bill. I really didn't think that was appropriate. Another call to Optus. They used all Mr CJ's details to do a full search and could not find any record of an account in his name. Well, I asked them, why are the debt collectors hassling us? Oh, I don't know. I'm sorry, I can't help you. That was the last phone call with Optus.

This nagging urge to do something is what the early bloggers and tweeters felt, as they helped launch the Egyptian call for democratic reform. And it’s the reason so many people all over the planet look at what is happening with such hope. Yet, we all worry at the same time. What if the extremists on both sides take over and hijack the effort and return the country to dictatorship? What if the larger world powers don’t support the effort enough?
It is the young Boers who will lead the Volk forward. The ones who carry new flags up mountains, who live their history, learn the songs and sing them spontaneously on former battlefields.

They can imagine a Boer future and are willing to fight for it.

If this was priced at $9.99---actually no, not even at that. $5.99 is what I would pay for this. And one of the chief reasons is even if the Nook screen is lovely, the images will be small. I know the photography must be great so thank you very much, I'd like to be able to see it and enjoy it.

a) The more you stretch the dough it comes out thin and crispy but if you prefer it a bit soft leave it a little thicker.

I had some people ask how to make pasta at home.
The trick to getting this cake right is the whisking of the egg whites and folding of the mixture. You need a nice stif fluffy base of egg white for which to add your other ingredients or the cake will end up too dense and a bit flat.
Albert Ayler: The searing and searching saxophone of Albert Ayler (1936-70) explored the roots of jazz as much as its outer reaches. John Coltrane brought Ayler to the Impulse label, where he recorded a dizzying display of his iconoclastic lore, including these two scorchers, Love Cry and The Last Album.
With either pessimism or with a clear view of reality, he told the other disciples, “Let’s also go with Him, that we may die with Him.” Thomas looked at all the options and expected the worst, he could die along with Jesus. But he was still willing to go with Jesus. He may have been a pessimist, but a courageous one.
Kunzru points out that we seem to have accepted the principle that it should be illegal to think, read and write certain things. Incitement to violence is rightly criminalised, but what about imagining violence? It's hard not to link Malik's poems to other trends - the push for ever-widening hate speech laws, the calls for writers like Monica Ali to be "careful" about how they represent the world. We are being taught to be circumspect. How long before it's suggested we should shut up altogether?In fact my records look pretty weedy besides Kunzru's: I downloaded instructions on how to make a bomb when I was researching the IRA for my latest, unpublished novel. I have to say though that even as I downloaded them, a couple of years ago now, I had a sense of doing something incriminating - mainly perhaps because the novel is very much about such matters (persecution and the need to hide 'incriminating' evidence) , but also because I feel this atmosphere of intellectual repression has been building for some time. And I can't even prove my purpose: I never actually used the instructions for the novel in the end.
So what can you do? Switch to stainless steel cups. My kids, aged 6 years and almost 2 years, use the cups and absolutely love them. They have been dropped plenty of times and survived. But if you do use plastic cups make sure they are BPA-free.

Yesterday I found myself feeling all sorts of frustration as I strolled around the local mall. I bought myself a small notepad to start jotting down thoughts on-the-go again since I had stopped doing that for a few months. It helps to have a notebook with me, at least to let my mind throw out all the pent-up thoughts. It may not make sense, but it helps to relieve the thoughts stuffed inside my head.

If true, this finding would be consistent with Liberton et al. (2009) who found that European face shape has differentiated from West African face shape through a selective force that has acted primarily on women. Both findings, in turn, would support my argument that many of the differences we see among human populations are not due to differences in natural selection, and hence differing natural environments. Instead, the cause lies in differing intensities of sexual selection, and whether this selection has primarily targeted men or women (Frost, 2008).

For centerpieces, I made these cute little Easter trees! I got those teal pails from the Target dollar bin. You will see those again this summer! And the eggs and Easter grass there too. Then I just cut dogwood branches from our yard. They are held in place in the buckets with rocks and I put a little water in there too.
We decided to purchase some new bookcases and a "sofa table" for our living room, which, of course, requires emptying the old ones and whatnot. Dh has given up waiting for the fish to die of old age, so they were given away yesterday, but the tank is still not emptied--dh spent most of yesterday afternoon and into the evening putting together the new furniture. There are still about 10 snails in the tank and I hope to be able to rescue them and add them to the almost 30 rescued yesterday from the decorations, and I'm not sure how many snails the mom who took the fish took. We had a lot of snails. Just little guys, but still.

Working in cryptography has a huge variety of working schedules, due to the wide range of possible career paths. A job for an internet security consulting firm might have standard hours while a jobs in an in-house enterprise or a government agency/ bank can run into emergencies at any hour in the night to protect sensitive information.
Two years were enough for me to be embroiled in this fascinating womans world,she showed me lots,but in the end it began to take on a dark path of tis own , and I then knew it was not the path for me..it showed me lots of dark truths and promised me power of epic proportions. It was at that point I saw also the truth was interlaced with a twisted darkness and from that moment on I had to get out…I have not seen Susan since.

Rabbit Heart is a unique, dark romance novel. Nicollette’s lovers die while having sex with her; leaving only a smile on their faces and no battle scars. She unintentionally kills many lovers and is heartbroken by each occurrence. Nicollette is then forced to flee her beloved home and finds herself trapped in the same situation to kill, yet, another lover. A malady our poor lady suffers dearly for.

Well, we are still frying down here in south Texas! I tried to take the boys out to the park for a little while yesterday afternoon, but we only stayed about 20 minutes before retreating back to air conditioned spaces. I should have taken it as a sign when we were they only ones there! I think today we may try the library instead, at least that way we can escape our heat induced house arrest for longer than 20 minutes.
She expressed both her pride and pain over the 40-year-old crisis center. It has been an invaluable resource in the Tampa community, but Ho-Pehling, like many others, wishes the need wasn’t there. She talked about the many focal points of the Crisis Center:
Beautiful Madelinetosh Prairie superwash merino laceweight in the Fragrant colorway. This will become a lace scarf that I'll submit somewhere. Or sell in my Ravelry shop. Oddly, this colorway is not listed on her site but is available elsewhere. I guess they need to update the website.
I was the first to move. I simply ran, I heard my father call after me but I didn't turn around I carried on running dodging around d the birds lying in my path. All of a sudden there was a sound, not quite a rumble, not quite a growl. Then I screamed that scream I had bottled up. All manner of living creatures came scuttling, running, crawling, running and slithering up behind me the townspeople had not screamed, but simply parted like the red sea in awe to let the creatures past. They were all heading for the gates and so was I. in the crowd of animals there were mice, rats, snakes, worms, lizards, cats, insects, and so many others. Then I turned to face them and the animals rushed past, in a stampede of fear, but I stood my ground the ground shuddered violently and in front of me the road buckled and I fell over as the earth itself tried to regain control of itself. Then my head snapped upward. And the sight was incredible. The mountain was swelling at the peak. The animals continued to flash past me but I could only hear my own heart in my ears. Then the summit exploded, sending boulders flying into the air and tumbling down onto nearby houses, the mountain started to bleed molten rock and I suddenly Knew the end was hear, with that my heart tried to beat out a life time's worth of beats in one minute, then one last rock came falling down towards me, I didn't try to move I just let it's shadow grow bigger around me and closed my eyes, what happened was right it was meant to be. It is destiny.
Do you believe the death sentence should be reinstated?
Upon hearing about her, I thought, Wow, I wish there was something like that around here for Aiden. It took me time to realize that I could make it available for Aiden, and other children like him.
It wasn't all doom and gloom though, as some days the shadows applied perfectly, without any sheerness or chunking up. The above look with Sailor Moon on the lid and Sailors Mars and Venus in the crease was my favourite look that I created with the products - it was just one of those days where everything worked, and my makeup didn't try to fight my face for once. I also really liked the look below that I did with Millennium Falcon on the lid over a silver gel liner, with no chunking to be seen!
The previous two mornings it was 61 degrees when I got up. I can live with those kind of early morning temps. Not only were the temperatures great, but we received early morning showers; yesterday morning’s being with thunderstorms; loud and windy with lightening and thunder.
Chuck Taylor is unlike any other YA character i've ever read. He's cynical and real and I felt like I was really inside a teenage boys head the whole time I read it especially certain parts (aka the first line of the book). Theres simply not enough YA books with a male main character, either that or I'm just not reading them.
Planned Parenthood does far more that provide abortions. Far more. Far, far more. In fact abortion services are just a tiny fraction of what they do. But after listenting to this girl and looking at her website, it's clear that's what her motiviation is all about. As far as the sec education materials that GSUSA has available, the thing to remember is that are not required. They're available for troops who decided to use them, they are geared towards older girls and they are NOT required for any badges, awards or other recognition. In other words, if this girl and her troop find them so reprehensible, they don't have to use them. However, other troops might not have the same outlook. They should be able to use them.
We do good deeds not to get saved; we do them because we are saved. It is difficult (is it not?) to be rescued from slavery to sin and a self-centered existence and depression and despair and fear and panic without feeling an overflow of gratitude and a desire to express that love to Jesus. If someone pulled you out of a river while you were drowning, would you not feel thankful toward that person? It is the same scenario here. We do good deeds because we are overflowing with thankfulness and we want everyone who is drowning to be rescued out of the river.
My name is Aulus Cornelius and on the day before the last flames of the dying republic flickered back into life again, I was sitting in my small, but pleasing garden, watching the light from the brazier quiver and then disappear. I felt my eyes begin to grow sleepy and then gradually close, the papers I had been reading earlier lying forgotten and forlorn on the dewy grass...
The first mention of the star was in Amos 5:26 regarding the trek from Egypt to Canaan. Then in 922 B.C., when Solomon married the daughter of Pharoah and went into magic and witchcraft and built an altar to Ashtoroth and Moloch. The book traces the six pointed star from Egypt to Solomon, to Arab Magic and Witchcraft, to Druid use(references are documented). The book traces the star through Freemasonry usage to Mayer Amschel Bauer, who, in the 17th century, changed his name to depict the red six-pointed star (or shield) which he had hung on his door in Germany, and thus began the family of “Red Shield” or Rothschild. The research carried on through this family, to their court of arms, to Cabala, to Astrology, to Hitler and his putting a yellow six-pointed star on all Jews during the holocaust, to the Zionist symbol, and finally to the flag of the State of Israel and beyond.
Which brings me to the latest addition to the family, a very naughty, hyperactive but extremely cute new member of the clan. Doesn't listen to anything I say, has a habit of chasing joggers round the park and steals shoes, newspapers and any food within reach.............what have we done??
- After marriage compare husband with Father.
One evening, we were chatting about whether we thought we'd cry during our wedding ceremony, and Alex admitted that he hadn't cried since he was ten years old. "Guys are taught to hold in tears," he explained. "As a little kid, you don't want to be labeled a cry baby by your friends. I quickly learned to be stoic." And that lesson stuck: He hasn't shed a single tear since then, even when his father died.

I try to pick out dresses for Lilyanna that are something more than "just a pretty dress". I don't like clothes just for the sake of clothes. Instead I try to pick things for her that reflect her personality. (And by not picking pink or princess, I reflect a little bit of mine as well.) I loved her non-pastel-non-meringue dress for Easter this year. She wore a navy blue dress with red cherries. The red patent leather shoes were totally her, and she felt happy and comfortable in her dress all day.

There is zero proof that giving kids the message that playing is a punishment for being fat, or that they have to play hard or they will die, will lead to healthier kids, thinner kids, or help develop a lifelong love of movement in kids – not a shred of evidence.
Imagine a young man who believes most people just want to be left alone. Let’s call him Paul (not a real person). Paul’s belief dictates the terms by which he interacts socially. He has a few friends, and he’s fine socializing with people he already knows, but he has a hard time making new friends. He’s unlikely to take the initiative because it’s too big a risk with a high probability of rejection. Paul doesn’t want to annoy people who want to be left alone, so he mostly keeps to himself. His social circle remains small and stagnant, and most of his social connections come from his work. Paul has virtually no relationship prospects because he considers women to be unapproachable except under extremely rare circumstances. If he sees a woman he’d like to date, he remains silent and aloof. Paul feels that to ask her out would be a social faux pas because after all, she just wants to be left alone.

If you've been wondering why I've been on radio silence with respect to your comments recently, it's only because we spent the past 10 days in Turkey, a kind of last hurrah for our international adventure.

They self-released the "Rather See You Dead (Than With Wool On Your Head)" single on their own Disease Unlimited Records in a reputed edition of somewhere between 500-1,000 copies. The cover of the record shows a picture of Jerry's grandfather in a casket. It gave Jerry the idea to stage his own funeral as a promotional ploy. So he started calling around to all the big funeral homes to try and rustle up a casket, explaining to them it was to promote a record. Unsurprisingly, he was turned down time and again. But when he promised Sunnyside Funeral Home he'd get their name on the radio, they anxiously took the bait.

Attendance was surprisingly low. He signed his full name with a "HOF 2011" inscription, reflecting his introduction to the NBA Hall of Fame last year.
My kiddos are not weird, at least, I do not think they are. They are certainly not mal-adjusted. We do not school in our PJs. We have a set schedule and stick to it. I am certainly not a control freak. There is no militia here (even if my boys are obsessed with guns and hunting). And, my kiddos are social butterflies. They love to be around and interact with others. The misbehave...the whine...they fuss with one another...they are incredibly smart...they amaze me...they make me crazy...they make me happy...They are typical children. Everything about them is typical. Everything about them is extraordinary. They are mine and I might be a little biased and that is alright, because they are mine. I love them without end. Amen.
In Fiji, we have heard American pop music and passed KFCs. The cool thing, to me, is that even with the influence of the West, Fijians maintain a strong connection to traditional Fijian life. Many Fijians, if not most, are born into villages and grow up in a small, cooperative way of life. The traditions that have governed in Fiji for generations are still evident today, even to a casual two week visitor like me.
I have a confession to make. It was Fall 2008 and I couldn’t run to the corner of my street without getting winded. I was in my 30s, the mother of two, with a successful career. I wasn’t particularly out of shape. I have been in good health most of my life. But I couldn’t run to the corner. And that bugged me.

Whilst this bubblegum ditty might not make you realise, the Prescot-born and eventually Rome-based Stott actually had a very credible history in sixties groups which are incredibly sought-after by collectors now. Serving time in Four Just Men and the legendary Wimple Winch, he has earned his stripes as a soldier in the great Freakbeat wars - and the B-side here "Henry James" is a firm reminder of those roots. Riddled with psychedelic effects, screeching car tyres, and a pounding, nagging beat, it's a far cry from the pure pop of "Chirpy" (which incidentally I've always had a soft spot for).

We are sponsoring Bryson's uncle who is on parole. Ironically he used to be our drug dealer and literal partner in crime. When we got arrested and started working our way back out of the hell hole we created, he continued on the wrong path and wasn't so lucky to get probation. He got out over a year ago but still hadn't learned and went right back to selling dope and violated parole in the halfway house. This time he has made it through a more intensive inmate rehabilitation program than he had to. He finished his time in the halfway house and now he needs somewhere to live. The sad reality and irony is that there are no other family members that are clean and can promise to provide a home free from weapons and drugs, but we can.
I ended up in Mr. Ugly's lane but thought, hell, maybe he'll be nicer since I have an adorable baby with me. Unfortunately, he didn't seem to remember me at all, (after all the times of harrassing me) And started in on the questions. He moved from the normal questions, into the sticky ones and right on over to the ugly ones. His final statement to me was "Huh, well.....he's better off over there (Mexico) then anyways."
In case any of you would love to try this out, it's quite simple: make a box lid- mine is 5.5 inches square and just glue it to a thick base cardstock (mine is 7 per 7 inches). You can embellish the edges however you like. Just a tip: next time I would use paper lace - it's easier to adhere it and make a frame round the window:)
I’ve been fighting to forgive myself for how much I gave and how much I held back. How hopeful I could be. How mean I could be. For the times I was cold when I should have been warm and warm when I should have been cold. I cannot justify any of it other than to say, along with Ray Porter in “Shopgirl,” that well…this is life. To remember, as Jack Gilbert reminds us, “that Icarus also flew.” And to believe that he was not failing as he was falling “but just coming to the end of his triumph.” So we came to the end of ours with singed wings.

Everyone who was invited to the birth had already been sent a ticket, and that allowed them to know who was supposed to be there and who was not supposed to be there; and so I stood in front of the double doors that led to the birthing room, and each time someone came into the waiting room I would ask to see their ticket.
Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? This is, in very typical rush style, a lie by illusion. Why mention taxpayers paying for anything since this issue had nothing to do with taxpayer services? He does this to muddy the water create the impression that those supporting this issue are looking for some sort of government handout. Not true, but a typical Rush lie.

So there was the rub. Amazon turned from plain distributor to book publisher as well, and said to its public "You choose". Barnes and Noble developed with less vision and scared for whatever reasons of loosing the "backbone" of the traditional publishing houses, did not cater to the newly formed market of Indie. They made it somewhat difficult to publish, and they also applied some incredibly arcane structures to their rules. True, if you go through Smashwords, you beat those rules both for B&N and for Ipad. Indeed Apple, on its page, almost asks you to go to one of its official partners and do them a favor by not going through their specific process.

I’ll tell you, I’ve lugged my Nikon D90 SLR camera to many events and loved the results I get, but the weight of that camera and lenses often makes me wish that someone else would carry it for me. That’s why probably 75% of the time, I take my FujiFilm FinePix, 10 Megapixel pocket camera. Even if I carry my Nikon, I almost always have my FujiFilm camera anyway. I’ve had 2 of these in the past 10 years. It takes fabulous pictures, has great skin tones, and also takes wonderful videos. It’s inconspicuous and very easy to take candids, close range flash photos, and has an adequate zoom lens built in. I’ve gone for 3 days without having to recharge the battery with moderate shooting – that is, 300 – 400 pictures for me.

I've been thinking about this a lot since that conversation with my mother, and the mere idea fills me with such joy, that I think I'd like to do it sooner than in my old age. In fact, much sooner. I don't know when --I think I just have to let life happen and see when it would be a good time to do this.

Gram left me this legacy of being a courageous woman, and I very much want to be like her. I feel like the past few days have been my very ungraceful initiation into that role. I see more and more how that courage comes from God, because I sure didn't feel it on my own. I just keep whispering these quick prayers, asking God to give me what I need to face it all. I was leaving the pharmacy this morning and when I turned the car on, 'Courageous' by Casting Crowns was playing. I cried, because it felt so affirming. He gives me strength, again and again. We were made to be courageous - I have that line from the song in my head, and I think it over and over.

After the family, there are the mutual friends to consider. Even if you meet these people as someone’s partner, in time, hopefully, you would have built a friendship on your own merit. At some point, one partner or another moves on and the new partner is introduced to the friends. If it was a clean and peaceful breakup where the couple had become friends, this scenario would not be much of a problem. The problem arises when there is a scenario like the one between my parents, and of course it depends on what the other person is like. What if the new person who started seeing your ex before you ended was marking his or her territory all over social media pages of mutual friends? What do you do then? Are you meant to delete the mutual friends that you have?
So I guess what I learned this morning was that criticism pops up everywhere in life, and that learning how to use it is valuable whether you own a restaurant or write a book. Or maybe I already knew this. But until today, I had never so clearly seen the parallel. We writers aren't so unique in our struggles after all! Which is kind of a nice thought.
During the prom, Tiffany and I attempted to be cordial, but it became obvious that neither of us had an interest in each other. We didn’t talk during dinner, we didn’t want to dance as the band played, and we didn’t smile as our pictures were taken. Most of the evening, we sat in silence and stared dreamily at the students whom we really liked. Through that ordeal, I learned that love cannot exist unless both parties freely choose to be together.
Everyone who takes part in my Blogfest (actually posts a story) will receive two points if your a follower and one point if not. If you put a blurb about it in your sidebar, you’ll receive another point. If you tweet about it (make sure to use @dl_h) you’ll receive another point for each separate day you tweet (up to a maximum of five tweets), and if you a post a blog entry exclusively about the High Drama Blogfest/Giveaway…you’ll receive a whopping five points. That’s a grand total of 13 possible points to place into the virtual hat. On August 8th I’ll draw six numbers (three from Group A, and three from Group B) using a random number generator. If you forget to post your entry on August 7th, all points are forfeited.
While I’m not going to re-write it now, I think the situation reveals a serious racial cleavage that we still have in this country. While the civil rights movement was transformative for this country, the so-called end of the civil rights movement fell short of anything resembling equality or the onset of some post-racial society. The civil rights movement opened the eyes of many people in this country, and did a lot to push forward equality for African-Americans and other minorities in this country; however, the mountaintop has not been reached. We do not live in a post-racial, equal society. We live in a society where civil rights have stagnated. And it’s this stagnation that further exacerbates the problems of racism, stereotyping, and profiling in this country; because people – mostly white people – feel that because the civil rights movement is “over”, then everything is peachy-keen. We’re done. We live in a country where racism, sexism, classism, sexual orientationism, and every other –ism are dead. BULLSHIT.

Bake until the soufflé has risen just over the rim and is lightly browned, but is still jiggly in the center, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle with confectioner’s sugar and orange zest. Serve promptly.

The next night was the wedding. Ex BF Jered was there, which I knew he would be, but I was determined not to say a word to him. As we walked up, he stopped and said hello, and I just mumbled hi as I walked by. I just did not want to have anything at all to do with him, so he couldn't go back and tell his skank girlfriend I was talking to him so she'd text me.
Thus the two of us ended up standing in front of the mirror set into the Victorian hall stand, both lifting our fringes and grinning into the mirror trying to see where our wrinkles were and comparing them! What a lark! We were laughing so hard we probably developed more wrinkles just by doing so.

In the video, we see Rayman and friends once again battling it out on a 2D plane in a 3D environment. One thing I noticed is that the foreground and background interaction is much improved over Origins shown by a large dragon sweeping over the level from the front to the back of the screen. Graphically, things look even better while still retaining that unique look that Origins had. Rayman Legend’s rendering looks much improved, and there’s now an online component, which was my only real big complaint from Origins. The game shines in multiplayer so I’m glad we’re able to now go online as well. Oh, plus there looks like a way to scan in characters similar to what Activision has done with Spyro lately. In the trailer you’ll see a Rabbid get scanned in, an extra heart and they even hint at other characters like Ezio from Assassin’s Creed. Not sure if this will be a universal feature, a WiiU only feature, or just something Ubisoft would love to implement.

Why am I having such a hard time finding the time, energy and motivation to write anything these days? I wrote my first rough draft while raising 5 kids and working two jobs. I am still raising those 5 kids but only working a part-time job now. So, why is it that I can't fit in a few hours a week to write? Fighting with health issues and keeping up with the kids and such is only part of it. I need to get excited about a story again. I have several ideas jotted down, partially outlined, and even started but I can't seem to get in to any of them.

And in some ways that's fine, but in others it just shouldn't be called something it's not. You can't brew a pale and call it a pilsner (I'm looking at you, Prima Pils) any more than you can brew a damn near impy stout and call it a brown. I'm all for bending the rules, but you shouldn't just break them. Some people may call that "creative," or even "on the edge," but the truth is that this is a stout. No ifs ands or buts. It's not "difficult to define" any more than Arrogant Bastard makes beer that I'm "just not ready for." It's a stout.
And those are just some of the buildings that we saw the first afternoon we were in town! Amazing! We were literally driving all around and I just kept jumping out of the truck to take this picture and that picture until it became too dark for good photos!
Fresh lychee fruits are available in the markets from June to October. The Fruit must be allowed to ripen fully on the tree itself since the ripening process stops soon after harvested. Overly maturity makes them turn dark-brown in appearance and lose their luster and flavor. While harvesting, snip off entire fruit brunch, keeping a short piece of the stem attached.

Paul and I had a lovely day yesterday, although Paul especially.
Anyway, I arrived in Leeds, got on the train to Skipton, populated by it's usual mix of housewives right out of the 70s and weird, chavvy results-of-incest people, and off I stepped, in Skipton, into Gran's car, and away we go, to the fair land of Barnoldswick. Let me tell you something about this area: you should go. Okay, sure, you're bound to get bored, if you stay up in those parts for anything more than, oh, say, a day. But the countryside is truly beautiful. Dark, gentle, wet, OLD. I love it. And I love staying at my gran's. The thing with me and my gran is, we haven't had a particularly smooth relationship in the past. Memories of her chasing me round the house with a broom, calling me the devil child, and I laughing in her face and screeching "you can't catch me though, can you?!" But with time, people mellow, and people become more accepting of each other. She has relaxed a lot these past years, and I'm also not a cheeky, difficult 8 year-old anymore (right?). The thing with Gran is, she's very political, and a feminist. In fact, she said to me in the car, on our way to one of those never-ending shopping trips, "Do you know, I think I would have been very happy to live without a man. Very happy indeed. In fact, if I were of your generation, I don't see that I would have married at all". Fair play Gran! I spent two days there, watching programmes like 'Village SOS', and 'Totnes: discovering life in our towns', eating comfort food, and just enjoying being with her. I wish I could see her more often, I really do. My panic "Holy fuck, what was that, is someone trying to break in?" mode kicked in, but I think it may have something to do with the book I was reading before bed (about a killer who preys on a psychologist's patients, driving them to commit suicide....OMFG!)
…so we have a portion of the team posing as a new circus act to inspect some shady business that may or may not be related to the circus itself. Apparently this means sticking to alliterative names.

The reason is simple: we never stopped working on the problem. We only thought we did. It was a young scientist called Mark Beeman who, back in the 1990s was studying patients who had suffered damage to the right hemisphere of the brain, that realised, as he puts it:
Three American astronauts, made up of Captain Neal Patterson (Eric Fleming), Lieutenants Mike Cruze (Dave Willock) and Larry Turner (Patrick Waltz), and a bulky Professor (Paul Birch) are on the first manned mission to Venus. Not that they had much choice, seeing as how they borrowed the uniforms from Forbidden Planet and all. And when they arrive, instead of little green men they find women...humanoid women with high heels, lots of makeup and nice form-fitting dresses.
“I’ll do it,” sniffed Pricklewood. “But I haven’t even bought any presents for them and the shops are closed now.”
In October of 2009 I attended a conference in Joshua Tree California, it was hosted by Whitley Strieber. A few days after the conference while traveling in Utah I started feeling chest pains. Later that same day I found out that my friend Mac Tonnies had died at the very young age of 34. A few months before this, I had spoken to Mac about an overnight stay in a hospital after he had fainted. The doctors were focused on his heart, but they never had an answer to why he fainted.
Okay, a few quick tidbits before we look at some pictures. In 1961, Evel Knievel hitchhiked all the way from Butte to Washington, D.C., while carrying a 54" rack of elk antlers. His goal? To draw attention to ... and end ... elk culling in Yellowstone National Park. This was one of his acts of derring-do that actually paid off. The culling stopped, and he didn't break a single bone. I already mentioned the gold, silver, and sapphires, but how about this? A Montana sapphire is actually included in England's Crown Jewels. And it's the only U.S. gem in the lot. Ever hear of a buffalo jump? Nope, it isn't one of the skijoring obstacles. A buffalo jump was a hunting ploy used by American Indians. Imagine an Indian hunting party chasing some buffalo faster and faster toward a steep cliff. (You see where this is going, don't you?) The buffalo run off the cliff, and voila! Meat for the tribe. Montana's buffalo jump is called Wahkpe Chu'gn, which translates to Too Close For Comfort. There, tourists can imagine what a buffalo hunt was like, while trying their hand at throwing an Indian hunting stick. Canadians are a little more descriptive with the name of their buffalo jump. It's called Head-Smashed-In. I kid you not (And it's okay if you laughed.)

In his article, “Thought Reform 101,” Professor Kors cites a “multicultural educator,” who quite candidly professed, “White students need help to understand what it means to be white in a multicultural community. For the white heterosexual male who feels disconnected and marginalized by multiculturalism, we’ve got to do a lot of work here.”
How can you pray for us? Patience, wisdom, peace, strength, opportunities to bear witness to the reality of Jesus Christ as our rock and refuge, our ever present help in a time of need.

The politics that brought us all of this were legitimized because they triumphed in the Spadina Expressway battle. How different things would be if the other politics had prevailed. Replace protest, street theatre, marches, civil disobedience and an alphabet soup of community organizations with backroom deals, bureaucratic control and growth at any cost. Civic duty in this scenario is reduced to paying taxes on time, following rules and picking a candidate from a ballot just as you would pick a brand of soft drink from a variety store shelf.

People believe in God because the world is very complicated and they think it is very unlikely that anything as complicated as a flying squirrel or the human eye or a brain could happen by chance. But they should think logically and if they thought logically they would see that they can only ask this question because it has already happened and they exist.

I cried and carried on all the way from the prep room to the room where the lumbar puncture was to take place. The technician told me to get it together and calm down and be still, that they couldn’t do the procedure if I was moving even the least little bit. Jimmy explained that I have a panic disorder and was without medication. The tech replied that “That’s okay, but she needs to calm down.” Yes, and diabetics can control an insulin coma by willing themselves to feel better. Asshole.
Dismantling the ramparts around my fears is a slow process, the tools more often like nail files than wrecking balls. With persistence and the aid of erosion, maybe even these inadequate implements will be able to scratch some small breaches into the edifice.

This tag was really fun. I cut a tag out of basic kraft paper with the vagabond that I then covered with Goosebumps. I let that dry and then rubbed on Distress Ink in 'Ripe Persimmon'. Once that dried, I sprayed Goosebumps again. 'Barn Door' was then rubbed around the edges. While that was drying, I used the same 'Barn Door' ink to stamp another TPC stamp. The leaf was made using yellow paper that had been rubbed with the same two distress inks. I added the crackle paint in 'Clear Rock Candy'. Then I went around the edges with Perfect Pearls. I liked the look of the Gold Perfect Pearls so much that I stamped over the background with a leaf stamp and used more on it.

Granted, I’m thinking mostly of a dog here, but even cats and other animals can be a lot of work. Think of it as having a small furry child because your pet will need everyday care and attention just like a child does. Food, water, exercise, and attention are everyday needs, plus the chores of additional house cleaning, litterbox, cage or yard cleanup, and the extra expenses of food, treats, veterinary care, and possibly grooming are all important items to consider.

Also, people in Wanzhou do not use heaters. Weather is cold about -4 C right now. People do weird things there. They wear many layers of clothes to keep them warm. They open their windows to let fresh air in ( air is more polluted than in Beijing). They sleep with layers of clothes on, and even eat clothes on. Inside the houses you have to wear slippers. There are slippers for bathroom, to kitchen, to showers, to regular rooms. Just slippers, slippers, slippers. My feet got blisters on just switching slippers from room to room. lol

As I see it, there are three main problems with the United Nations as it stands today. The first is its organizational structure. The General Assembly gives equal representation to each member nation, which is appropriate since it is an organization of nations. What is missing is a connection to the people of those nations. I would propose adding a second body, consisting of representatives directly elected by the world’s people. Each member nation would be allocated one representative for each 0.1% of the world’s population it contains. Nations with populations smaller than 0.05% of the world’s population would not be represented. This would serve to greatly increase interest in the United Nations among the people of the world, and would give some experience in democracy to those countries that do not practice it at this time.
The Morestran commander, the increasingly unhinged Salamar, attacks Sorenson with a radiation source but this only causes him to produce multiple anti-matter versions of himself, which soon overrun the ship. The Doctor finds the original Sorenson, takes him back to the planet in the TARDIS and throws both him and his samples into the pit, fulfilling a bargain he earlier made with the anti-matter creature. Sorenson reappears unharmed, and the Doctor returns him to the Morestran ship, which is now freed of the planet's influence.

I thought the cakes tasted a bit eggy. Mrblocko agreed, but didn't notice until I pointed it out. I like eggs so it wasn't a deal breaker for me. If this flavor was a negative for anyone, a drizzle of dulce de leche could hide any eggy elements and no one would be the wiser. I may do just that tonight when I wolf down another cake, not because I didn't like the taste of the cake. I just like dulce de leche and feel guilty eating it by the spoonful.
Ahhh, reincarnation. Need I say more. Many of us probably spent hours day-dreaming about who we could have been in the past. While the tale brought back all those memories, it also opens up a dark corridor to what might go wrong, betraying love, killing the ‘new’ woman, being trapped and so on.

No, it's that Stuckey, famous for his November 2005 claim to a credulous New York Times reporter "It's Orwellian, almost," regarding critics' charges of little transparency, claims that “the opposition to this project hopes if they say something enough times, people will believe it.”

I have one regret and that is that I didn't get to nearly as many blogs as I wanted (hoping the linky stays up? I would really like to get to everyone over the next little bit). My life just got busy and then more so and then the month was over and I really wanted to visit everyone. Part of my plan for next year (yes, I'm planning on next year already...have we not discussed what a planner I am???), is that, since I'm in charge of big things at work, I am going to make sure they are in March so that I can have this go better.
Then I started seeing a series of great Broadway musicals. I saw productions of THE KING & I and GUYS AND DOLLS. You know all the great musicals of that period, and I fell in love with show business. I became fascinated with show business. Meanwhile, at night, my parents were not allowing me to watch television, cause they considered it uncultured. So I was always listening to the radio. And to this day, I'm still mad with them, cause I really missed out on the golden age of comedy on television.

Kids of my generation just suffered massive brain damage and head trauma if we fell off our bikes. There were no stupid laws about riding sans helmet. We just rode around the 'hood helmet free and by golly, most of my generation is half-way functioning. Well, save for those of us who sorta made the economy go in the tanker because we bought adjustable rate mortgages that we surely couldn't afford and then the banks blew to pieces and the government had to bail our arses out. That wasn't me though. I never fell off my bike and endured massive bleeding from my cranium. The kids who did prolly are the ones who can't budget their money. I don’t want some kid knocking on my door asking if he can take the pony on a spin if he doesn’t have a pumpkin helmet with him. The wrath of that kid’s parents would scare me silly.

Funny thing is, I found when I was feeling better and went to drink a cola, it seemed so egregiously sweet to me, I couldn’t stand to drink it. Instead, I switched to a somewhat less sweet alternative, Gatorade.
Just then Mi Roo gets a call on her cell but it doesn’t sound like anyone is on the other end. But it’s actually Hae Ra calling to check on her whereabouts and sure enough she can hear fireworks going off indicating that Mi Roo and Jin Oh are together.

All week at the Doodlebug Blog, we are posting Mother's Day Cards and gifts. Using a Square Baroque Create A Card and some Hello Spring patterned paper, I created a card that contains a gift.
When I was growing up our “outings” or vacations consisted of going out-of-town for weddings or funerals and my parents would say “say hello to -so and so- they’re your relatives”. I swore I thought I was related to every Mexican American person in Texas! Now it’s coming back to me because when I take my kids to family weddings or funerals I find myself saying “say hello to -so and so- they’re my cousins”! My kids automatically hug everyone they meet now and tell me, “ I met your cousin -so and so!” lol

We had to create the city of Bombay on two streets! We got away with some scenes set at night. That’s why I had so many burning tyres. I based the Bombay bits on my own experiences in the city. We used the city’s landmarks such as the Gateway of India and Marina Drive. You have to put flags down for audiences to identify the city.
Evan and Kyle have always had feeling for each other extending beyond just their friendship but for various reason they had never made the steps to show each other just how much they mean to each other and what they truly want. Kyle is afraid of hurting Evan, and Evan is afraid of getting hurt especially after getting out of a relationship which has left him feeling unworthy and heartbroken. When Kyle is given a journal from his dead grandfather, the story in it that his grandfather writes opens Kyle up to his feelings and gives him the courage to believe he could make Evan happy. When Dennis was causing friction between Evan and Kyle I was so irritated, I hated him, but in the end he didn’t turn out to be such a bad guy, he had his own reasons for when happened with Evan and he was also hurting, he did what was best for Evan even though it ended up hurting them both.
And that made me walk even taller than I possibly ever could!
The new musicians respond in kind. Robert Glasper says, "If Charlie Parker came back from the dead, he'd say, 'You're still playing the same shit I was - what the fuck are you doing?" Robert Shipp says, "I don't have to view music through the prism of 'Bud Powell played it like this' or 'Bill Evans played it like this'. Fuck those guys. I do it my way."

In short (and because this post is considerably more than 200 words and funnily enough took far less time than the above exercise)I did in fact produce my 200 word count for the day, and I am now considering keeping a ketchup bottle on my desk to remind myself that however empty I might feel, sometimes all the brain-bottle needs is a little shake to get the juices flowing.

I love my dogs. It doesn't take long for someone to realize that I'm borderline-dog-show person. The only way I get to stay on the sane side is by being equally immersed in other activities. This blog post isn't entirely about dogs, it is most much about what I've learned through showing dogs. I've showed, trained, handled, and judged (not in all activities) dogs in conformation, weight pull, drafting, rally, herding, water rescue, packing, and obedience. Needless to say, I was exposed to many different breeds and many different types of dog owners. And the politics in the dog world is tremendous. The movie, Best in Show was a severe understatement of what really goes on at dog shows. Dog show politics makes any other type of politics (including governmental) look like a walk in the park on a sunny day when the birds are chirping. I heard that horse show politics are worse, but I'll avoid that for the time being.
For those of us who used to just accumulate air miles strictly by going to the liquor store, I’m sure you’ve realized that by the time you are 95 you may have earned just enough to buy a gift card to go to the movies.
The offer came in at $2500 more than I make now, with yearly bonuses, paid time off starting January 1. I got the employment packet in the mail and the insurance benefits will cost about 50% of what I pay now. All of this is good for the checkbook. I have to send in some paperwork and do the normal drug test and credit check. I am going to take off about a week between ending old job and starting new job.
it was totally what you picture italy as, pedestrian only allys, old men riding bikes with baskets, tree lined streets with sidewalk cafes, everybody EVERYBODY smoking *cough, gasp*.

The road from that point was a narrow one. Picnickers in buses will have to get down there and walk. As I rode along, I realized that it was becoming a deep forest. I also realized we were all alone there. Not a single soul to be seen anywhere. That was kind of an eerie feeling.
I much prefer a book where the language reflects its setting to one which has been blandly set in a mid-Atlantic Anywhere. We can't all travel to other countries. We can read books from all over the world.
So the next time you have off jump up in the morning, early, before the cat and dog wake you for their morning food, before the sun rises and see what you can find. Trust me; it will be exciting regardless of the pictures you get in return.
Despite his rough day on the course, the Golf Channel reports fans should not worry: if anyone can still win after missing the cut, it’s 14-time major winner Tiger Woods. One GC analyst went so far as to say he still considers Woods the favorite to win this event.

When I was a kid, I remember getting my first transistor radio; made in Japan, then people were starting to get concerned about Japan’s role in electronics development followed by their entry into motorcycle and automobile manufacturing. In response, buy American programs were instituted by companies such as the American automakers to encourage people to keep buying American made cars. Sam Walton prided himself on providing American made goods in his pilot discount stores. Americans kept working, American manufacturing thrived and wages went up, as did the price of goods.

Wooden spoons for invitations! Yes, we were going to do this in style. Alas, the party never happened; the night before it was due to take place, she was struck by a brain haemorrhage. She died two weeks later.
The answer was simple: I just needed to get the dog some different water. But how was I going to contain this water? I was too short to get a bowl from the cabinet. But I sure knew where some shoeboxes were! So I ran down the hall to the linen closet to fetch one. I filled it with water from the sink, and said, “Puppy! Look! I brought you new, better water! Come over here and have some or our toilet isn’t going to work!”

Dunno. I just know that if all family photos had a peeing kid in the background, they'd be much more interesting. It could even devolve down to a "Where's Waldo" sort of thing: find the peeing kid in this photo!

What is true of my family, however, may not be true of yours. Many men are so taken up with the world of machines that they think it idle to carry a pocketknife. After all, you say, chocolate bars are scored to break easily, cigars are now manufactured with holes in their heads, and the post office efficiently breaks all package strings before they reach the addressee. Who needs a knife?

When I do a preapproval for a first time home buyer, I do my best to explain how the offer process works. Many come to me with this expectation that they plan on offering at least 10% below asking price. I always ask how they came up with this number. They say, that is what they read or that is what they were advised to do by someone. Where do they read this stuff?

The idea though is just to play for 45 minutes when I come home. That’s as detailed as my mission statement gets. Play anything. Do anything musically related that involves a guitar in my hand. I’ve been choosing to play songs rather than to work on exercises. I’m going with that. Letting it be fine. I say play what you like to hear. Steph and I were listening to the blue album this past weekend, and it’s still one of the greats. Tight production by Ric Ocasik. Matt Sharp was still in the band. I read a nice if perhaps slightly-uninformed piece by Film Crit Hulk on why Weezer sucked after Matt left. Short answer Hulk give is no harmony. The music is much lamer without his contribution. Of course Hulk really mean no counterpoint from bass. Less structure. Less interesting. Less tension too apparently.
Stargate Command is contacted by the Kelowna’s, Jonas’ people who were building a naquadria bomb in anticipation of a Cold war suddenly heating up. The Kelowdan’s neighboring countries on on the verge of signing a non-aggression pact. Such an agreement would leave Kelowdan vulnerable to attack from superior forces.

How you treat your family. Do those who live in your house see Jesus in you? Do your words represent Him? WHATEVER also means WHEREVER ,including home where we often let down our guard and treat our family differently than we would treat a guest.

Very recently one of my friends lost her 24 year old son (her one and only child) and she ask me for a poem to be read at his Memorial Service. I started looking through my poems and nothing jumped out at me, I though oh no what will I do..I can't deny this sweet, grieving mother of a simple request such as this..I'd never met her son so I thought that maybe I could write something from a mother's point of view as I have a son. I started writing and nothing seem to work..No words came that I could go with.. knowing I only had a few days to do it in and fearing I would disappoint her, needless to say I was at a loss..

The UK is sick. A century ago, the human stock of the country was strong and vibrant. Now it is weak and decadent. The slaughter of the UK's finest in the Great War damaged the genepool in ways of which we are only now becoming aware. In the second half of that same conflict (following the pause from the end of 1918 to late 1939), the job of obliterating the best of humanity in Europe, was completed. The rise of the anti-humans such as Winston Churchill has continued apace until now we have in parliament the double act of the Jewish Capitalist Cameron and his sidekick Clegg, 'opposed' by the Jewish Communist Miliband. A healthy nation would not allow such people to take the helm of State.
First, let’s take a step back and consider the actual process of becoming disabled. We frequently have a false sense of security owning disability coverage. The question I ask is: “Will you collect benefits from your disability insurance policy when you become disabled?” Most of us assume that our disability policies will provide benefits on a timely basis at the point of disability. Regrettably, too many of us discover the inadequacies of our disability insurance programs after we’ve either already become uninsurable, no longer qualify for coverage or we’re facing the devastating financial consequences of a long-term disability (LTD).
This crucial period has become a promising new target for prevention, raising hopes of conquering public health scourges like obesity and heart disease by intervening before birth. By “teaching” fetuses the appropriate lessons while they’re still in utero, we could potentially end vicious cycles of poverty, infirmity and illness and initiate virtuous cycles of health, strength and stability.

An article in today's Telegraph regarding the current situation of rebel fighters refusing to either go home or disarm, carries the questionable headline "As lawlessness spreads, are the rebel 'good guys' turning bad?" This rather pre-supposes the notion that the rebels were ever the "good guys" to begin with, rather than a rag-tag bunch of extremists, known terrorists and some fighters who genuinely believed in the cause of deposing Col. Gaddafi.

It's not okay to pitch your novel or query an agent or editor via Twitter, but following them is a great way to find out what's going on in the publishing industry and with their own work; they might tweet "Finally getting to my January queries" or "I wish someone would send me a good mermaid erotica manuscript," for example. And if an agent tweets, "If I get one more manuscript about woodland creatures or wizards I'm going to throw my computer out the window," then you know to send your novel about a squirrel who goes to wizard school to someone else. Of course they also tweet about things that aren't work-related, like what's going on with their kids or pets or where they like to shop. They start to seem like real people, almost.

So what do I think? I think it plays out much like a lot of horror franchises. The first is a relatively scary and entertaining horror film and it all goes downhill from there! Seed was ridiculous, but entertaining. I just hope they stop making them, though. The madness has gone on long enough.
When Terrill and I first got married, I wasn’t sure how many kids I wanted. Right after Jack was born, I wasn’t sure I even wanted the one I had :-) But when Paul was just a couple of weeks old, I knew I wanted at least three. I can remember one night in particular when I had gotten up with him, sitting in one of our red chairs in the living room while I held him. Of course, he was adorable and precious, and right then, I was convinced I wanted another Saxon in our family.
Adding buttons to bobby pins is a great way to turn an ordinary object into an amazing fashion accessory. Buttons harvested from old clothes, found buttons and buttons leftover from sewing projects are all good choices for this project.
The next step was to glue newsprint over the letters. One or two layers is plenty. I just cut out very generous letters and glued them over the cardboard, coaxing a gentle curve into the space between the letters. You could also just skip the newsprint and run a bead of paintable caulk or spackle in the crevice, smoothing it out with your finger. This step is key to getting that "pressed tin" look.

But it wasn't last, because people are not always on Facebook when you need them to be. More fiddling around on Google reveals that 'catch collagen' is more properly called 'mutable collagenous tissue' or MCT. And now we get somewhere: there is an article in The Journal of Experimental Biology, 2002, that describes research into MCT in echinoderms. Current thinking, it appears, is that the sea cucumber controls the connections between fibrils of collagen by releasing chemicals into its tissues:

I’ve never worried, nor do I think any sane person should worry, about the ultra-affluent. They have the tax advisors, the products, the structures and the tax shelters to help them.

My oldest would happily lock himself in his room w/ one of the game systems and only emerge to grab food or switch out games. He could probably keep this up for a month if left unchecked. My youngest emerges more often, but he has more of a strong will. So if he has his mind set one doing X and i say it's time to do Y - the battle would begin.
