I live in my head a lot. Probably not more than your average introvert, but more than my extroverted friends. And I’m content eating alone, or going to the movies alone. (I’m even contemplating going to a concert alone, because the one person who would want to go with me isn’t sure he can. And I don’t want to drag someone along.) I don’t have to have company. It’s nice, but only when it’s productive. I don’t want to see a movie I’m interested in with someone who doesn’t care, just to say “I’m not alone.”

I needed something different yet healthy with less oil so that I could feast on it myself... I have a pretty limited diet currently and was not allowed to eat even chips till a week back. I was really craving some healthy crackers when I came across the Ottelonghi Olive Oil Crackers on Passionate About Baking but I had to put a healthy twist to them to make them brown! They are made with all purpose flour but I used half wheat flour to make them.
Now that the arguments both for and against ObamaCare have been made, it is in the Supreme Court's hands. Going into the fight, the law's supporters were cocky and arrogant. Coming out the other side, it's a different story, to say the least (actually, the term "panic" seems to be the go-to phrase). While we wait for the Court to make it's decision, I'd like to see some ideas from Republicans about what to replace the law with in the event it is struck down.
PureVolume: You just released a new EP, Talk To Me, on April 3. How has the reaction been?
2009: Crossing to Safety, by Wallace Stegner
Beth wasn’t in the room so far as I remember and we quickly hatched a plan to conceal the damage by covering the pan with tin foil, of which we had 19 rolls because each of us kept forgetting that we already had some so each week we came back from the grocery store with yet one more roll. I think Laura just used the last of it in 2011. We then went to pot luck and got at the very front of the line, which was a little unusual for Laura being from a polite North Dakota stock and about as fat as a needle. When grace was said, we leapt forward to the casserole, blocked anyone’s view of it with our bodies (more mine than the aforementioned Laura), and quickly served ourselves the nibbled corner of the casserole so no one was the wiser.
I have invited some ladies over to my home Saturday night for some crafting time, so I thought I would share one of the cards that I designed for the occasion.

John Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony once said of the colony, ” we must consider that we shall be a city on a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.” But, what happens when the light of that city dims against the backdrop of the world? America was once seen as possibly the greatest motivator and force of good ever to exist and why was that? 1.) The acknowledgement of the “Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe(quote from James Madison), 2.) Recognition of certain natural laws given by said Lawgiver, guaranteeing such liberties, secured for the people from tyranny by revolution, and 3.) proclamation of the same such laws and, from such, liberties that are for all( the Emancipation Proclamation).

Amit Bansal answers, I don’t think getting a job will be too much an issue. However you may have to start with small brands and may also have to compromise a little with the profiles. Once you get a break you can explore opportunities. However whenever you are applying for a job ensure you highlight your experience which is relevant to the profile expectations. This way you can highlight your overall experience with a benefit to the prospective organization.
Do I digress? Are you asking does this still have something to do with LOVE being abundant? Hold on. It has something to do with another related point I am trying to make. Wait for it.
Now go here and type in your brand and type. It will give you a number score that will tell you the risk associated with that particular product. Now take it with a grain of salt...there is so much debate in this industry and studies being done, etc. But I think you will still be surprised by what your current sunscreen is rated. Keep in mind that low numbers are good, high numbers are bad.

There are also more communication channels available in terahertz than the range currently used for wireless communication, so information could be more rapidly shared at this frequency.
Not all roving will seem to have a direction – it depends on the machinery it was carded on, some tend to impart more direction than others. The wool/fibers involved may also affect it (what they are, how jumbled they are, how carded they are) So if it feels the same both ways, dive in, and see how it spins.
Let him know your long-term goals, so that he knows why you can’t spend on unnecessary things. For example you could say, “I would like to have $2000 saved by the end of the year, so that I can go back to school. That’s why I can’t spend $50 on a concert ticket.” It would be a good idea to do inexpensive things for him to show you care. You could bake him his favorite cookie, set up a room with candles, soft music, give him a massage, or cook him dinner. The most important thing is to let him know that regardless of what you do, you love to be with him and that you care about him.
These two beautiful cakes were our last two celebration cakes of 2011. This Tangled themed cake is one of the most, if not the most beautiful Tangled cake I have seen. The details were just stunning and our client was very, very happy with her cake.
I can’t speak for Anna Quindlen (more on that in a moment), but I imagine that she would have a similar reaction to “Girls.” Her new memoir, Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake, reminded me that Quindlen is the voice of my generation, beginning with her “Life in the Thirties” column for the New York Times 25 years ago and continuing through her books. Like many other women of a certain age, I find myself nodding in agreement as I read her new one.
Twin Hand Movement, the fantastic and severely underrated debut album of the Jan Hunter-led Baltimore band Lower Dens was a favorite of mine when it came out two years ago. It was a spare, foggy low-droning album filled with tension and anticipation. The songs serve as a mask and outlet for Hunter and her thoughts, who as a lead singer and performer, is as painfully shy and reclusive as you can get.

Life for the gullible is always teetering on the edge of disaster thanks to the indifferent hearts of psychopathic grifters, con-men and investment brokers. Bastards left and right are out to insert a hand into the wallet pockets of the vague and upstaring, to rip out their financial guts. E@L, gullibility made flesh, is pretty fucked up at the moment in this division, as the more perspicacious reader of this blog may have assimilated by now.

Actually, it’s bleakly fitting. There’s an event we missed talking about in Shada. A news story that would have happened during when that story aired. The man with the best claim to having created Doctor Who, David Whitaker, died on the 4th of February, 1980. And it is Whitaker, in the end, who most troubles the idea that Doctor Who is a rationalist show. His stories are drenched in alchemical symbolism, as we’ve noted many times before. If you want to argue that Doctor Who is a nearly 50-year-old quasi-sentient metafiction that has actively placed the spirit of Hermes Trismigistus into the heart of contemporary British culture - and I admit that I do - you face an uphill battle. Except for the fact that David Whitaker essentially created the show. Do I believe that David Whitaker actually consciously did this?
He said I could quit my job if I wanted to. I would, but then where would we be? It's nice to know he cares that I don't like my job, though.
Police officers and Firefighters are the most obvious examples of workers that CHOOSE their job over any possible health risk involved on a DAILY BASIS. They put their lives on the line everyday to do their job, and many of them also choose to smoke. OH THE HORROR!
Ahhh... the complexities of the internet! How often do you go looking for one thing and end up in a completely different place then you intended, but all the happier for it? I just posted about how I found Kristi's guest post (from last year) on a blog I hadn't seen before called Magnolia Rouge. I just finished telling my sister this morning how the gals down under have a definite swish vibe that goes largely unacknowledged in the North American fashion world. When it comes to weddings, I often find inspiration from the Koala Continent before I find it stateside. I live in a town where we get a ridiculous number of Aussies and Kiwis that arrive for the perpetual winter (since theirs ends when ours begins) and let me tell you, they are a stylin' people! Magnolia Rouge is definitely right up my alley, but what really got my attention was that there looks to be a new eMag in the works! My other passion is interior design and architecture... and in that world there are now plenty of online magazines that came into play when the glossy world fell apart a couple of years ago. I guess I am surprised at how long it has taken for the wedding industry to catch on... but then, it's not that there aren't any out there... just that there are not many that I have really been drawn to.
I liked Vee from the second she started talking. Her point of view felt different to me and I appreciated it. Though she's in an odd situation, I felt like she respected not only what she could do but that she respected the person she slide into as well. She knew that what she was seeing were the parts of life meant to be secret and didn't try to use those secrets to her advantage. I love that she has pink hair but I love even more is that she has a reason for having pink hair. Nothing about Vee felt forced or improvised. She is fiercely loyal to the ones she loves and will do anything for them. Plus, she isn't scared to put herself in danger if it will help. Her fearlessness is endearing and her in struggle figuring out how to put her family back together after her mother's death truly make Vee and unforgetable character.

The Starbuck's had been a challenge. Carter had wanted to stay as close to the shore as possible, but the sound of gunfire had drawn in him. Guns meant survivors. Full-humans, anyway. Not over-humans or under-humans or whatever they were being called. Luckily for him, there was no shortage of shotgun ammunition throughout the island, and even more pistol ammunition... 9mm and .45 cal were the most popular. This latter fact surprised him somewhat, what with New York's strict handgun laws. He supposed that was the American way, really... the government makes something illegal, and the populace just gets better at hiding that something.

Deliverance was not by chance for all was in the hands and plans of God. If that were the case can you not see the futility of trying to do it their own way? It is clear that God provided deliverance from the wages of sin but man still tries to do it another way. Those on that ill-fated vessel could wonder how such could be accomplished for they were lost at sea, tossed to and fro, totally at the mercy of wind and waves. Now comes the report that they will be cast upon a certain island. They would be cast; they would be castaways; marooned.

Since the time of its discovery, the Spanish have been obsesionados (obsessed) with chocolate. Chocolate drinking establishments are called chocolaterias in Spain and serve the sweet, rich beverage, as well as cakes and pastries to accompany it. So enamored were the Madrilenos with the drink that the Pope was asked to change the rules regarding fasting to exclude chocolate! To this day, chocolate is a standard breakfast drink, especially in Madrid. Chocolate con Churros (Hot Chocolate with Fritters) is a popular breakfast around Spain.

The afternoon session can always be a tough sell, when everyone has a full tum, but a Q&A panel discussion was the perfect choice. It is fascinating to hear different views on why we blog, for the most part it is financially a thankless task, but rewarding in many other ways. For me personally the buzz is when someone cooks a recipe I have shared, or learns a new technique. Or just has a chuckle. Everyone has their own inspirations, hearing so many different approaches reiterated to me there is no one fit, as the song says “you cant please everybody so you’ve got to please yourself”….or something along those lines!

Representatives of the two senators and a local congressman gave brief speeches to welcome us to our new roles and encouraged us to actively participate and exercise our duties and responsibilities.

What does the index mean for NAMA? NAMA has chosen a valuation date of 30th November 2009 to value the Current Market Value of property. The NAMA Long-term Economic Value Regulations state that evidence produced after 10th January 2010 by the ESRI is not to be considered when evaluating future conditions in which the long term value of the property will be calculated. The latest figures show residential property has fallen by 14.1% from 30th November 2009 to 31st December, 2010. The PTSB property price series is the source for the Irish residential data in the key property market data at the top of this page. The NWL index is now at 893 which means that NAMA needs to see a blended increase of 12.0% in property prices across its portfolio to break even at a gross profit level (taking into account the fact that subordinated bonds will not need be honoured if NAMA makes a loss).
A lot people in modern day’s world are working hard striving for success,but why is it that very few attain it?Im 18 years old and for 6 of these 18 years I searched desperately for a formular of success….and I found it!Whats even better is that im going to give it to you..for free!Have you ever noticed that the bad feeling you have when you refuse to give someone something and the feeling you have when you LACK something is in actual reality the same feeling!Now think of that for a moment.Conversly the feeling of fullfillment you have when you GIVE to someone is the same feeling you have when you are in an urbundant state…Now here ,good people lies the secrect to prosperity,its simply giving!We live in an orderly universe and in this universe there can never be a vaccum,therefore: “when you give more of yourself to people,more things tend to enter into your life to fill up the space left by the thing you gracefully gave”.So you need only to learn to give and to keep in mind the fact that you are going to receive in due time.due to the short length of this post I have barely scratched the surface on the topic of giving and how to master it.Be sure to leave your comments for feedback and if you feel you have a burning issue contact me personally on facebook,my full name is Tapiwanashe Mushove…..dont forget to leave your comments!
A few years back, we would just get “(Arguably) the world’s most useful gift catalogue” from TEAR, but now it seems there has been an explosion of gift catalogues where every charity has decided that TEAR was onto something good (which they are), and done the same thing. Now with so many options to choose from, I’m finding it difficult to know which ones to support. So I thought I’d sift through a few that are available this year to find out what’s good, what’s different, and what to consider when choosing from one of the many charity gift catalogues around.

(Note: This focuses on girls' and women's issues because, well, I have a girl. Much of what I've written does apply to boys as well, and boys have their own set of issues. I'm not saying that there isn't pressure on boys to be manly (there is) or that moms of boys shouldn't get irritated when they have their own limited color palette to choose from (you absolutely should). Men's magazines offer body image ideals just as unrealistic as those for women, and this should upset you (though women's magazines and female models are far more prevalent). Boys are encouraged to be aggressive and ridiculed for showing emotion (and you should fight this). However, a) I have a girl, so the issues there are more glaring to me at this moment and b) worldwide, boys maintain that preferred status while girls suffer.)

The one positive thing in my life this weekend was finally, FINALLY, getting enough dirt to fill that f-ing raised bed garden. But I didn’t even have enough time to plant anything. And don’t you even think for a minute that, “well it’s okay Julie, your little seedlings will do okay for another week in their egg cartons”, because I KILLED THEM. I TOLD YOU I WOULD. I HATE MYSELF. I had been growing them outside during the day and then taking them in at night so I wouldn’t really have to harden them. But then we got some snow a couple weeks ago and I took them in and forgot to put them back outside for a few days after. During that indoor time they really started growing, so when I finally brought them back outside they were pretty much Scorching Colorado Sun newbies. Shit.

While on vacation we were visiting and fishing from the Pensacola, Florida, pier, and had experience we won’t forget. A huge pod of dolphins spent the day there, frolicking and fishing themselves. We got to see them jump, play, and herd and catch fish. Because they stayed right around the pier, we had a great view, and the water is beautiful, clear and turquoise there. This year we went back to the pier, but we didn’t see a dolphin. I hope we do the next time. This dolphin was very excited about his fish.

This brings up so much more than the experience of one individual, but rather how the NHS (and people in general) view mental health, social media and blogging. I’m struggling to put my thoughts into words but I will try my best. As it stands to the best of my knowledge, there is nothing in my writings here that I would not say to people’s faces. I make sure to not give away any identifying features of other patients, staff or people I’m associated with. I’m not telling their story – I’m telling mine. For a while now, as I start to reach out within “real life” mental health awareness and come out as a full-on mentalist, I’ve been waiting for someone to put two-and-two together and ask if this is “me”. Does expecting to be caught out writing about my mental health defeat my anonymity? No. Are all mental health bloggers liars? No.

On the grounds, there is a unique rose garden, which grows an ancient species of rose from Patagonia. It is surrounded by a circle of wooden frames, as seen above, and it was intended that this circle could be seen from the sky. This was not an accident as when Ernesto designed the winery, he looked up into the sky for his inspiration. The round winery is intended to symbolize the earth while the rose garden symbolizes the sun. The symbol of the moon is their labyrinth of vines, where Ernesto actually hopes people will wander lost for a time, and "get to know their inner souls." At the center of the labryrinth, Ernesto has buried a cow horn stuffed with crushed, powdered quartz, also known as Biodynamic Preparation 501.
To develop the story, Tony thought long and hard about the Big Bad Wolf. “My way of finding The Big Idea is to think very very hard about the character: who they are and what they want.

You can say at any one time: What does that character want?”
Jon started off with a bit of background about himself – he was booted out of university for his part in a sit-down anti-Apartheid protest: ”The same thing would be applauded now, but at the time it was a big deal.” He went on to say that if it hadn’t been for that he would have never met, and become friends with, Lord Longford, and certainly wouldn’t have become a journalist.
So, despite my foolish catch-up run, I did manage to, overall, build my pace over the course of the race. I hope to replicate that in the May marathon (but starting at 11 minute miles).
But, I’m getting off on a tangent…again.
Sometimes you need a gentle nudge to engage with an author for the first time (and sometimes a bloody great shove) and for some reason this is even more the case with authors that you suspect are actually very good but just haven't tickled your fancy enough. Huge thanks then to @wayfaringreader (as she's known on Twitter) for convincing me to read this superb novel (something she backed up rather hilariously with a tweet from Ivanka Trump who was enjoying Great House by the side of the pool). All of the reviews I have come across have been wonderfully positive and a belly band that came wrapped around my copy included one that mentioned Krauss as being Philip Roth's most likely literary heir. I wasn't quite sure what a comment like that was supposed to mean but as I read I began to have an inkling what Yevgeniya Traps meant in the New York Press. Krauss is the kind of writer who creates characters with such detail and specificity that they don't feel like characters in a novel at all, but real people whose stories we long to hear. She does this with the kind of mature psychological observations, emotional detail and interconnectedness that you can find examples of time and again in Roth's work. Regular readers of this blog will know that when I come on strong in the opening paragraph it's because I want to save you the time (if time is a luxury) of reading on and speed you towards a purchase. I'll join the chorus of approval and recommend this novel wholeheartedly: complex, engaging writing that slows down the reader; characters that live and breathe and even have the ability to affect your own breathing; a novel that deals with loss and memory so tenderly that it makes itself unforgettable.
I think that now there seems to be coming plenty of bands who have jumped the wagon so to speak and I think it’s sad to see that. Most labels today have not got a feeling for quality music thus flooding the market with low quality bands. I guess they just see the opportunity to cash in – and since they won’t do that they will drop the poor bands after one album. Nothing bad spoken about these bands, I think it’s great that this type of music get’s the attention it needs – but bands get signed too early on before having had the time to grow together as a band and get their own identity, and the people who actually buy their records are no fools, let’s not underestimate the listener. Therefore they will not buy the records, the labels lose money and people get fed up wasting cash on bands that are not good enough. When this cycle has reached its peak interest in this genre will fade away, except for a few devoted music fans, and the focus will move on the “next big thing/genre”. It is very fashionable right now to play this type of music, and even though we haven’t really released anything yet we have always loved and played this music to some extent. For us, we are not interested in being part of this hype attention that is happening now (although it helps of course let’s not deny that) and I honestly believe that we have a different approach to it as well. At least a few of us in the band are rabid vinyl collectors and love a lot of bands that probably no-one has ever heard of as well as listening to all different kinds of music. A good song is a good song – no matter what genre. This gives us something of a different background, as opposed to only listening to Black Sabbath and Pentagram then thinking “Hey let’s start a 70′s heavy rock band with occult leanings!”

Further, although the Frenchman’s lawyer offered up £1million in bail, gave a permanent address where he could live with his sister – and accept 24/7 monitoring – the Judge turned it down. He could’ve worked from her apartment, now he can’t. Sticking him in prison doesn’t make sense (if he’s monitored, he’s monitored) unless you’re trying to make somebody look dangerous. (When he arrived at the bail hearing, the accused was handcuffed and frog-marched in).

I don’t know how many people actually read this blog, but to those who do, I have not abandoned it!! Grad school just took over my life recently so I avoided doing any more writing than necessary. Didn’t do much baking during this hectic spring semester either, aside from these yummy cookies I whipped up while scrounging for baking supplies one morning, when the mood struck me to permeate the house with the smell of something deliciously sweet. I found an unopened package of Andes chocolates, along with some cocoa powder and nothing else but the basics, so I was set on making some mint chocolate magic happen. These cookies turned out delicious, and surprisingly very soft despite the cocoa powder… I think the extra tablespoon of butter did the trick, so don’t skimp on it!!

Foreclosures have also seen some dramatic increases over the last 10 years. Between 2002 and 2009, foreclosure filings increased 345% before dropping in 2010 and 2011. What’s unclear is whether the decline is due to an improving economy, a slowdown by mortgage lenders due to legal questions, or a combination of factors.

They ask, not because they genuinely feel I will grow out of this "phase", but because the fear I will not is growing in their hearts.

I have held my job for over 16 years now and have made myself pretty indispensible. I have earned performance awards, special act awards, etc. At my church I have never been one to be comfortable sitting back and watching others do the work. I am pushing up my sleeves, lifting things heavier than I probably should, getting sweaty & dirty, but getting things done. I have always tried to never have the attitude that I am better than anyone else, or that any particular job is “beneath” me. Toilets sometimes need to be cleaned, trash to be taken out, weeds to be pulled, floors to be swept & mopped, carpets to be cleaned, etc. Everything we do is an act of service for the Lord and anything that needs to be done is worth doing right.

In 1979, graffiti artist Lee Quinones and Fab 5 Freddy were given a gallery opening in Rome by art dealer Claudio Bruni. For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with the art form. Fab 5 Freddy's friendship with Debbie Harry influenced Blondie's single "Rapture" (Chrysalis, 1981). And who can forget Malcolm McLaren's unlikely foray into hip hop in 1980, when he first met Afrika Bambaataa on the streets of Manhattan. Then later released the album "Duck Rock" in 1983 (too much of that snow white!).

Our school is very fortunate to have extensive classroom libraries in each room, so my students are sued to browsing for books and choosing appropriate levels, most of the time. We also have Accelerated Reader at our school, so kids are invited to read any books that are "Just Right" that will help them move closer to their AR Goal. I have books in my library organized by genre and individually labeled by Guided Reading Level, so I oftentimes will guide students to appropriate levels at the beginning of the year and touch base with them throughout the year if I see them in a book that is too challenging/easy. I have found, however, that with AR, kids are much more motivated to choose appropriate books so they can do well on the comprehension quizzes and hit their goal by the end of the trimester.

Basically think of the board game Clue. All the characters are represented with a few additions. They are all being blackmailed in McCarthy era style and someone dies, then someone else dies, etc. They then have to figure out who the murderer is. It could be any of them and they all have a weapon, a la the board game. The simpleness of the plot makes the comedy easy and the twist 'endings'... and yes there are three different ones that were played in different theaters across the US... smart and well calculated.
James Sire in his book, The Universe Next Door, says that a worldview is “a set of presuppositions … which we hold … about the basic makeup of our world” (page 16). He more precisely and wordily defines it thus: “A worldview is composed of a number of basic presuppositions, more or less consistent with each other, more or less consciously held, more or less true. They are generally unquestioned by each of us, rarely, if ever mentioned by our friends, and only brought to mind when we are challenged by a foreigner from another ideological universe.” I’ll go with that definition, though I find it a bit cumbersome.

Miss Anything? Not really.
Sometimes I feel like I’m just floating…no line, no lure, nothing to keep me tied to the shore. I’m surrounded by lots of stuff – but I’m just floating. No direction…just floating! Decision making is the hardest task I have to do. When I have a ton of tasks to finish or just start – sometimes it’s hard to decide which has to be done first. I’ve seen a lot of people like that…sometimes the tasks or the problems in their lives are mountains. I wonder if that’s the way hoarders start out…they start keeping a few things that they might need sometime. And then everything becomes something they may need sometime. Their homes become a mountain of stuff that they don’t want or need. Some of us have that same tendency…maybe it’s not tangible stuff, but it’s a feeling or a worry or a lack of control in our lives. If we can just learn to take those problems, tasks or projects apart and do them a piece at a time, we’ll be restored. We’ll find our line and our lure and get back to the shore without getting wet!
This year I have come to love poetry. I read poetry, occasionally, before and have even cherished some. But this time it's different. In the past poems inspired me, comforted me, awakened my heart and mind to the extra- in ordinary, provided an unmatched vocality for the deepest suffering, the highest joy -- every experience, emotion and expression imaginable.

Now, it may seem petty and almost irrelevant to be picking on this group for their aesthetics and you'd be right to think so, however, all I'm doing is paralleling their position.

This is a call to arms to bring back the sexy larger knickers which we can sit down in without wincing but also wear in front of men without confusing them beyond belief (“Why are you wearing baggy bicycle shorts?”). French knickers for example, give lots of coverage but are still amazingly sexy. We’re not talking Victorian knickerbockers, we’re talking well-cut, bum-defining, gorgeous feeling larger knickers which stir the male imagination and make them want to see more. If French knickers were War & Peace, then thongs would be the equivalent of a post-it note; if you can read it on the shelf, why buy it?

As one might expect, the girls in particular were drawn to this picture, although none of them identified these beautiful young women in flowing gowns as princesses. Sylvia liked that they were sitting on "cushions." During our group discussion, we talked about the directions of their various gazes, noting that the girl (we were calling them girls) in the center was always looking right at "you," no matter where you were. One of the children mentioned that the dresses reminded her of a bridal gown she had once seen and we then decided as a group that they must all be brides. I read them the title of the piece, "The Wyndham Sisters," and that somehow, seemed to settle things. (For better or worse, having read the title, the children then began to demand I read them the titles of all the subsequent pictures we discussed. On the one hand it colored their interpretations from that point onward; on the other I admire that they were thinking deeply enough about what we were doing to want every clue they could get.)

This recipe is pretty close to Tessa's, but I changed the cheesecake mixture to include Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. The main reason for doing so was because I didn't have sour cream on hand, but I loved the subtle tang it gave to the cheesecake. And anything with Greek yogurt in it is obviously healthy. You're welcome.

Puma has been around for a decade, but never got purchased in large quantities by anyone. The latest model uses much proven tech from the Raven (both UAVs are made by the same company).

There is also a naval version, built to withstand all that exposure to salt water.

Around this time we started to notice that many restaurants menus became a little more pricey. Yet the menu items remained the same. Every year since then this trend has remained. Portions get smaller and prices get bigger. What I believe Disney is doing is making their menu items more pricey so people feel like they're getting their monies worth using the DDP. In actuality, guests are just paying more for their meals out of pocket or more for their DDP.

You could think of them as collaborators of a sort, but although they had many interests in common, their strengths were different. One early example of how they did collaborate was when Voltaire entered a contest for an essay on the scientific properties of heat and light. Émilie worked with him on his experiments and ideas, but at some point she disagreed with his conclusions and decided to enter the contest herself. Neither won, but both were recognized for their work by having it published. The prize was jointly awarded to three men one of whom was Euler. (That will give some of you an idea of the competition they were up against.)

When I tried it at PIB, one of the friends I was with had drawn a firm line: she didn't like beer. It was the "beery" quality that got her.

But then came the Duchesse, which she actively enjoyed.
I see the charge that "Zionists didn't care about the Holocaust during the war" as related to those works of scholarship and political polemic which talk about Holocaust memory having been manufactured after World War II by Zionists or Jewish elites. Alongside the myth that the yishuv was indifferent to the Holocaust, a myth arose several decades ago that American Jews did not really talk about the Holocaust until 1967, and that it only became a major focus of their attention due to Zionist manipulation. That is the heart of the accusations contained in works like Peter Novick's The Holocaust in American Life and the (far worse) piece of propaganda by Norman Finkelstein, The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering. These accounts have also been significantly undermined by recent, heavily empirical scholarship, most notably in Hasia Diner's We Remember with Reverence and Love: American Jews and the Myth of Silence after the Holocaust, 1945-1962.

I’ve already mentioned that I haven’t been tearing through the holiday beers as much as I did last year. Could be a number of reasons: (1) we’re more broke this year and I know that some of these holiday offerings will be on the sale rack in a couple weeks (2) I’ve had a houseful of women kinfolk this past week and consequently, I’ve been drinking less in an effort to keep my wits about me. (Men are generally less intelligent than wimmin and it only gets worse when the ladies congregate and a fellow gets a belly full of barley pop – I tend to say the dumbest things about six bottles into the evening!) (3) perhaps I’ve settled on a few seasonals that I know I’ll like and have wisely decided to pick only a couple of rare birds for sampling.
We cannot say that that the actual expansion of agnosticism is due only by the conditioning and cultivation of a modern concrete mind, but also due to the amount of contradictions of teachings from the diverse authorities, especially in regards of the concept of God, Men, Universe and how all they relate to each other. The truth of Christianity was intended to liberate the minds of men, not to transform them into slaves of dogma and discrimination, and puppets of selected elites.
This New Year's Eve was the third consecutive year we stayed home - After many, many years of partying the night away from home. 2008 saw our dear friends from Chennai spending New Year's with us, so we had a great time with them.

It is an interesting theory, but a dangerous place to let your mind linger. What if? What if I had done this? What if I hadn't done that? Would my life be unicorns and rainbows instead of the crap I'm dealing with now? My guess is a "what if" has already popped into your head. We all go to that "what if" place at times. Maybe it is a big thing like cancer, an accident, a personal tragedy. Maybe it is a little thing like getting pulled over or breaking your freaking big toe. Yeah, in case you haven't guessed I have found myself playing last Friday afternoon in my head and saying "what if...." What if that butterfly hadn't flapped its wings and I didn't break my toe right in half.

I never thought technology would be so intense. Producers can now edit from their desks. They can just pop it on while doing something else. It makes me wonder how much our brain can handle. How much can one person multitask? It’s hard for a lot of people to keep up with, but our generation has grown up on a computer and because of that, there may big transition to younger generation.
My heart and my mind were in conflict with each other as he stepped off the plane. 'I like him. Yes, I think I like him. But what if it doesn't work out.' The what-if's were looming and the confusion was mounting. A decision had to be made. Why? Because he was meeting my family for the first time.

So one thing that I started doing is budgeting. It’s a very foreign task for the impulsive spender that I am. I’ve been reading Suze Orman’s “Young, Famous and Broke” and boy has it been a helpful guide to getting my finances in order. It’s a good feeling to know where your money is going and how you can be financially responsible. I used to always hate talking about money because it was so stressful when it wasn’t there when I needed it or it was too confusing to understand interest and all that nonsense. But, when I actually took the time to sit down and once again, face my problems, I found it pretty helpful. Cheers to being on a budget.

What I find fascinating about discussions around masculinity now, seriously, is that there are few stories focusing on older men and women — past well into their 40s and 50s, but not yet old enough to qualify for retirement benefits — who have to take any kind of job to make ends meet.

Large data sets can easily outgrow L1 caches, which are size-limited because they must be as fast as the processor core. That’s why there are L2 caches. That’s also why there are L3 caches. Each step up the cache hierarchy is bigger—and slower. Finally, you get to main memory, which seems to be missing from Wegener’s chart but I can assure you it’s there. Main memory is usually implemented with SDRAM these days and today’s DDR SDRAM memories need hundreds of processor clock cycles to respond to memory transaction requests, so you really need caches. That’s just the way processor-based system design has evolved. Everyone would really love DRAMs that ran as fast as processor cores. Not yet.

However, with Newt Gingrich continually pressing into Mister Fantastic territory, Rick’s campaign suspension, and the impending conclusion to reality’s low-speed chase with Paul (Paul can barely walk, let alone run; reality is just a lazy bastard), we will soon lose all of our comedy fodder, at the worst time possible. Thus, America, I am proud to announce that… I will be your fodder. I will be the foundation of your laughter. I will be your new target for public mocking, your new source of gaffes. I will be your new candidate for the Republican nomination. I may be too young to run for the President, but are age limits not just an over-extension of the government’s power? Yes, they are. Shut up and start agreeing with me. You have to. I’m a Republican presidential candidate.
Everyone has been through something in life. I grew up in an unsafe environment and I have some pretty big issues with the feeling of safety. My safety is my first priority so to wake up and watch my country being accosted took the cake. Luckily my roommate - my brother who I can always depend upon to look after me - was at home so I didn't have to go through the horror of September 11th, alone. The day changed me forever and frankly, traumatized me. It made me very angry to watch the greatest country on earth get attacked. This is America - it wasn't supposed to happen. Not here.

Completely changing the way you do pretty much everything does not come without its challenges.

Long have we bemoaned the lack of a centralized resource for tracking upcoming releases and books in progress. ReaderAlert helps with the first; you can create custom searches by author, genre, and subject so that you can be notified when new books are either released or scheduled for release. It’s not quite as precise as we’d like, but this is definitely a step in the right direction.
So what about after it has calmed down? How do we address the issues? You can't really fix the underlying causes by just throwing money at it, even if we had any. Sure, you need programs to train kids, give them some skills so that they can make an honest living. We have some of those, probably not enough. But you need something else. You need to remove the alternative. What we are dealing with is a society in which for a couple of generations now the most attractive option for those growing up with fuck all is criminality. Looking around me, all my life it's seemed the easiest, most lucrative thing for those on a low income to improve their situation is to start dealing drugs. The risk of a criminal record isn't enough to stop people tearing the streets apart by now, and I reckon it's at least partly because it hasn't been enough of a deterrent so far to stop them using drugs and/or the money they can get from dealing. It's understandable enough. Wouldn't you? Any attempt to escape the incredible stress of having no money to pay off bills and spiralling debts, while living in areas populated by people who are just as fucked up, and reacting in fucked up ways. Something our dear Prime Minister is probably never going to get his head around. I doubt he has a friend who spent a year struggling with addiction, running scared and refusing to get help because the illegality brings stigma and the possibility of losing their child. I bet he's never lived somewhere he has to work twice as hard as the cunts next door who seem to be having some kind of rave-up marathon, because they're dealing while he's feeling like more and more of a schmuck for getting a job.

The easiest solution to all of this and one that Chinese policymakers will be sorely tempted to try would be simply to relax the “tightening” policy on money and lending. Let the money keep flowing and, for the moment at least, developers and speculators will have ready cash to pay their bills without selling off properties or jumping out windows. But China’s latest PMI (Purchasing Manager Index) numbers, released on Friday, indicate why that would be a mistake. According to Reuters, “factory inflation in China quickened markedly in September, with the sub-index for input prices climbing to a four-month high of 59.5 in September from 55.9 in August.” Despite the risk of a slowdown, all the money that has been pumped into the Chinese economy expanding M2 by 2/3 since the start of the global financing crisis in order to engineer an investment boom is still putting upward pressure on prices. China’s central bank knows that what might be good for speculators and developer more money could be disastrous for economic and social stability.

At the show, guests got to sample the Coconut Mung Bean Crepe filled with pickled daikon, long beans, carrot, bean sprouts and peanuts. The crepe was a little sour, and the style of preparation reminded me of Ethiopian. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of this particular dish - it was a toss up of flavors that didn't come together for me.

Method 2: Some prefer to cook the tomatoes then stir in the beaten egg at the last minute just to set it. I find this method can be a hit and miss sometime the egg can become too soft like a thick sauce than separated pieces of scrambled egg. Also with this method the egg is likely to stick to the pan/wok if it is not super non stick, and scraping it off will end up with tiny bits of overcooked egg. .
First off, the set up is completely illogical. We are expected to believe Cornelius, Zira, and a new chimp named Milo scurried off after Brent and Nova left them in BTPOTA to the sunken remains of Taylor’s spaceship. In spite of originating from a pre-industrial society, they knew how to repair the ship, get it flying, and somehow caught some sort of wave from Earth’s destruction in order to be thrown back in time to 1973. They managed to get airborne in a manner of a few days at most. Heck, I cannot even figure out how they got the astronaut boots on considering chimps have an opposable toe that could not be crammed into a human boot.

One of my last batches of beer was a biere de garde, a recipe that is fast becoming a staple for my homebrew palate. I am gratified to know that most who have tasted it have enjoyed it. And so my confidence grew, perhaps with a bit of pride. After all, I've not had to dump many batches of beer. Until…this particular batch was made with a slightly difference recipe, but nothing profoundly out of order. Fermentation, bottling, and storage went without incident, until the 2-3 week mark, which is the "usual" time for carbonation to develop. Much to my disappointment, at the 2 week mark there was no carbonation and at 4 weeks there is a little more but not enough to create the flavor and palate for which it was intended. It may yet come into its own, albeit late, or it may be destined for fertilizer.

“Ouray NWR was originally established to serve as a refuge for breeding and migrating waterfowl. More specifically, the primary objective was to provide food and cover for 14 species of nesting ducks. While the purpose for which the Refuge was established has not changed, the methods of achieving the purpose have changed. Management strategies today are focused on managing water to mimic the natural flood plains that existed before dams were erected along the river. Portions of protective levees throughout the Refuge have been removed to allow more frequent flooding. Five bottomlands within the river flood plain – Johnson Bottom, Leota Bottom, Wyasket Lake, Sheppard Bottom, and Woods Bottom – are fed by the river as it winds through the desert. In late May, as natural flooding occurs, ponds are formed, spurring the growth of semi-aquatic plants which provide food and cover for ducks and other wildlife. In addition, these ponds serve as nurseries for the endangered fish species of the Colorado River system. Water is a scarce resource in the desert, and Refuge managers tend it carefully.

Studies that have investigated the role of age in second language learning have tended to centre on the ideas put forward in the Critical Period Hypothesis (Lenneberg 1967) and the development of enhanced cognitive processing capabilities. This paper, on the other hand, argues that the ‘Younger = Better’ debate should not just be focussed on the route and rate of acquisition of particular grammatical structures or of target-like pronunciation but, should also refer to discussions of the socio-psychological and emotional factors that influence the language learning process, and how these develop over time. The paper draws upon findings from international research and, predominantly, on the findings of a longitudinal UK-based study of young learners of French. The study investigated the learners’ evolving motivation for foreign language learning during the transition from primary to secondary school. Data was collected at three points, at the end of Year 6, three months into Year 7 and at the end of Year 7 and is comprised of questionnaire as well as qualitative focus group interview data. The findings of the study highlight the integral role of the learners’ developing emotional and cognitive maturity on attitudes to the language learning situation and processes therein.

My husband came home the other day laughing after an experience of a heated debate at work. Two colleagues had arrived to a morning meeting with two different brands of freshly baked donuts. Apparently this was what began the war of 2012 among a bunch of men. For a normal work environment, I’m sure this would be similar to Christmas. For my husband’s work, this is an entirely different situation, one that conduces to a debate of which type of donut is best. These types range from cake-batter baked, deep-fried, crème filled, custard filled, and cutter shaped, and so on. There are a lot of choices but I would never seriously think a bunch of heated men would have this discussion at home. Lol, it’s more of a conversation that I would bring forth…
One of the inherent down sides to the Canadian comedy scene is of size – both of the numbers of comics and the numbers of Canadians. That audiences can still see people Like Mike Wilmot, Tim Steeves and Barry Kennedy at clubs – for relatively cheap floors me. Oh sure Tim is writing for Rick Mercer, Barry is doing all kinds of things including being an author and Mike is ripping it up in Australia and England for large chunks of the year – but still. This country should be rewarding comedians at that level handsomely – they should be celebrated.

I can, at least, somewhat divide the mess in my car. Somewhat. The front is presentable, trash is in a bag, and empty cups go inside to the sink. The back is deplorable, trash is everywhere, and empty cups roll back and forth across the floor mats, which, of course, has nothing to do with the lack of effort on my part to grab a cup or two or gather and dispose of trash (and petrified banana slices) while filling up with gas. Gas stations have large trash cans available for people just like me. Humph. I won’t bother mentioning the grass, dirt, and leaves.
That being said, I don’t know how I’ve been lately. I’ve had a lot on my mind. Nothing in my life is terrible or excellent at the moment, although I can’t shake the feeling that something might be a little off. The sensation is sort of like not realizing that you’re being bothered by an itchy clothing tag or an offensive background noise until suddenly it’s brought to your attention in a sudden flash of awareness. I’ve been so busy and distracted that it’s only lately I’ve begun to feel something like that tickling the edge of my brain, trying to break through.

Toast the quinoa in a saucepan for a few minutes. Add 4 cups of water and bring to a boil, simmer for about 20 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed. In a large pan, heat oil and add chopped swiss chard. Add the minced garlic and saute until chard is just beginning to wilt.
(& This is exactly the opposite of what Microsoft, Google, Facebook, et. al. want.)
First make the dough. Sieve the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder into a large bowl then add the beaten egg and gradually pour in the milk mixing with a wooden spoon to bring it together. With your hands, make it into a ball of dough then knead it on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until smooth (You may need to sprinkle over more flour to stop it being sticky).

Breaking It Down Further: Savannah Stone and her husband Zach moved to rural North Carolina after he was forced to retire from the police force in Charlotte due to a gun shot wound on the job, but when his old crew is facing a series of murders and their old friend the mayor seems to be the prime suspect, Savannah and Zach head back to the city to help solve the murders and clear the mayor’s good name. With the murderer leaving puzzles for clues, Savannah gets the chance to help her husband solve the crimes before more bodies turn up.

I had a productive day's sewing over the bank holiday weekend. I bought myself a SciPhone (the Chinese version of the iphone) so thought I would sew myself a cosy for it in the meantime whilst I was waiting for it to arrive in the post. I am really pleased with the phone cosy... I was a little less pleased with the phone (in fact I have sent it back as its rubbish), so the holder is now up for grabs on Etsy.... I do love the Alexander Henry spotted owl print :-)
Hello readers! I have a client that has some Schumacher Summer Palace Fret in Smoke wall paper that she would like to sell to my readers for A STEAL!!! It is gorgeous and absiluely stunning!

and I came up with this.
I have to admit, I had Kimberly’s connection to the whole situation pegged from the start, but it didn’t bother me in the slightest, I still loved reading about it and seeing it all unfolding before my eyes. What Haven did to make sure that the power wouldn't harm anyone and would not corrupt or cause any danger, sacrificing himself, was so heartbreaking but I am glad that it works out. There are quite a few twists and turns throughout the read and some things that are revealed that are unexpected, like with Haven’s father and what really went on with his mother. The plot is so easy to follow and the story keeps your attention right from beginning to end. I didn’t quite love this one as much as the last one, but it was still a great read.
I have a secret to share!!
This was proving to be slow going and for the impatient one it would be difficult ult. But Paul had just spent over two years doing nothing inCaesarea. Were his steps ordered by the Lord? If they weren’t he would have reason to question as so many do.

Women are also drawn by the free gifts, promotional offers and discounts that are found in any women’s magazine. That is why a women’s magazine with a sachet of perfume or a piece of discount voucher for a makeup piece would have a higher sales volume than one without.

So I’m not as bitter about my dismissal as you might expect, even though no one from the company told me I’d been canned or even informed me that my next column and a scheduled feature were no longer welcome. As a non-employed contractor in our brave new world of semi-employed twenty-first century servitude, I had to perceive I was fired. We all know how these arrangements work. Non-employees float in an opaque legal gelatin that can wash out from under us at any time. But remember, I had it coming.
Winding down, I made use of my new PVC hose cutter and re-installed the el. bilge pump which should be ready to rock when I get rid of that gook down there!
For the time being, I wanted to share a recipe inspired by Nigella Lawson's Chocolate Pudding. I made a few changes to this basic pudding and served it warm with a side of orange/mango sorbet. This was the easiest chocolate dessert and the perfect recipe to have on hand when you have a late night chocolate craving and not much in your fridge. It starts with plump canned pears - which help keep the pudding really moist. Although I usually prefer using fresh fruit, canned fruit really work here. They are plump and soft, and the extra juice they release gives the pudding a satisfying saucy consistency This sure hits the spot!
What are you passionate about? What inspires you? Goals need to be owned by the goal setter. And if the level of challenge is high, and you believe the reward is more than sufficient, the goal itself will drive and motivate you towards achieving it. I used to be a marathon runner until I was in a major car accident that prevented me from participating in that sport ever again. But I loved outdoor sports and wanted to stay active. I searched for a new dream – to learn how to “hike” the Rockies instead. My motivation was that it would give me exercise outdoors, plus the exhilaration of mastering the majestic mountains.

A large part of the Beatles’ allure is that, with each subsequent album, you could chart their development as songwriters, musicians, and human beings. It’s pretty difficult to do this with any other bands like, say, the Rolling Stones, who simply got older, or Led Zeppelin, who somehow got dumber with each release. In the same way, each episode of Avatar brings us closer to the characters and shows how they evolve as individuals throughout the course of the series, which almost never happens in a kids’ show. “The Earth King” simply doesn’t provide that sort of interest like previous episodes (even relatively lightweight ones like “The Chase”) did.
We completed the evening with a walk around town and dinner at Oscars. Oscars was our favourite eatery during our time in York and again most of my friends and family have eaten with me there at one point. Unfortunately the lovely building and courtyard they used to occupy was only rented and they were unable to renew their lease. However, they moved to a building only just around the corner and the food was as fantastic as ever.

Have you decided what gifts to give for Christmas? I did! And I can't still believe that. Each year I have a problem in choosing the "perfect" gift for each of my friends and family and after wondering through the crowded shops I eventually end up buying useless things because of my lack of ideas.
The question seemed to throw Mr. Potok off his game, as nobody, certainly nobody in the media, academia or the DHS had ever challenged his numbers before. He seems to hem and haw and grasp for words. At one point, Mr. Potok seemed to have a flash of sudden inspiration, the missing “hate groups,” said he, “are state chapters!”
Then probably Fujipet was considered garbage and thrown away. Now it is remembered in our hearts…
Had he felt that a sentence in excess of 26 weeks (the maximum sentence he could impose) was appropriate and could not be reduced, he would have had to send the matter to the Crown Court.

Psalm 78:70-72 in the Bible tells us that God chose David the shepherd boy to be the shepherd of his people and David fed them according to the integrity of his heart and with his skillful hands he led them. “Integrity of his heart” – what does that mean? According to Merriam -Wesbster’s, Integrity is defined as the quality or state of being complete (wholesome) or undivided.

Borderline personality disorder can be difficult to recognize, in part because individuals display different combinations of symptoms. There are nine criteria for borderline personality disorder, of which only five must be met for a diagnosis. So there are many different possible combinations of symptoms. The underlying condition that is shared by people with borderline personality disorder is instability in their self-image and relationships. It is important that borderline personality disorder be diagnosed and treated by a qualified mental health professional.
She handed me a Cinco de Mayo t-shirt the Mexican Restaurant was giving to all their patrons. I believe Cinco de Mayo (5th of May) is like Christmas in Latin countries. I proudly put it on when mom left – possibly my new favorite t-shirt. I can get excited by the littlest of things.

So knowing that, what good does it do to compare yourself to others? Does it make my accomplishments, goals, etc. any smaller because there are others out there that have done "more"? Or does it make my accomplishments, goals, etc. any bigger because there are others out there that have done "less"? I say NO and NO.

For these proposals to succeed, the legislators will have to vote in favour of a new law which reduces their power and discretion. To some, that might be an impossible contradiction and an unreasonable thing to expect, but there will be considerable political credit to the account of those who make this change happen. Our citizens deserve no less.

It was said before, “hope for the best and insurance policy for the worst.” Put differently a strongly built boat can withstand much, and most instances the boat may take in excess of the crew can.

1. As per Nick Hornby's Mixtape Rules from High Fidelity, the first track SHOULD be a great one... but it should also be a statement of purpose about what the album will be about (this has been true since Sergeant Pepper, the first modern album), and the second song should bring things up even higher, if possible-or go somehow further in the direction the album's going. No band has ever (or at least... SHOULD ever) put their most depressing song first. Or the one offbeat song that doesn't match the rest of the album's tone. The Joshua Tree put Bullet The Blue Sky fourth (a good place for a change of pace song), not first. White Stripes' Elephant also changes pace for tracks 4 and 5. Couldn't exactly gone any higher.
Thanks for stopping by, Nuala. Lots of good luck with this wonderful collection.
So this is just a little picture show of what I had to eat today. Two things are missing. The first is breakfast which was an Eggo waffle with a tablespoon of peanut butter and a banana. The other was just a snack that consisted of a couple of rice cakes. Yes I know. I don’t really care for them, especially because J picked up an off brand so it really is like eating cardboard. I was feeling snacky and needed some thing to munch on and they fit the kind-of -like-a-chip, but not really. So it finally occurred to me to take pictures of what I was eating at lunch time.

And I have added chocolate back in, as per the doctor's advice... at first only a little, but as I've gotten more hormonal and discouraged, I'll admit my chocolate usage has sky rocketed.
This is a great example of something a mini session could be used for. A small milestone, maybe you don’t want a full blown session but capturing your children as they change and grow up so fast, especially at this age!
I am beside myself with outrage.
Yep, your house gets the 7 year itch too. This can also be a symptom of why relationships experience it too. We can feel something is not right and it can quite often be our physical environment. If you have not moved in 7 years your home is likely bulging at the seams. This means every closet, cupboard, crawlspace, drawer and shelf is filled to capacity and needs a good once over. Depending on the square feet and working with a Professional Organizer your home can be decluttered in about 3 days.
The re-branding comes just as US toy giant Mattel completed its purchase of HIT Entertainment, the owners of the Thomas TV series, which is based on books first created by the Reverend Wilbert Awdry in the 1940s and continued by his son, Christopher.
They did taste good though – I’ll warm some through for breakfast tomorrow, hopefully they’ll be fully cooked then!
Another way I am like Sam is when he attaches himself to the wrong mom. If you are a mom of a toddler you know what I mean, for all others let me explain. When we pick up Thomas from kindergarten, we have to pick him up inside the school. The little kids run up and down the hallways while we wait for the kindergarten kids to be dismissed. From a toddlers perspective that's a lot of big people and legs. So often a toddler will cuddle in eventually to who he/she believes is mommy because aren't all big legs their moms. Unfortunately when they finally look up, way up, they realize "that's not my mommy" and go and locate their mommy.

Sunday was church, then family time. Grandpa George came for delicious roast dinner that John cooked- mmmm. We finished off with hot cinnamon rolls. That night the girls had a sleep over upstairs, and Cole and John slept in our bed and even watched a movie on John's laptop. Everyone was happy!

T: If you make a career of recording you’ll sometimes find boredom will set in. For days and months (and maybe even longer), you’ll go along recording songs with different artists and making the best recordings you can make (with the raw and sometimes woeful talent you have to work with). Then one day there is a moment when you push up the fader on a vocalist, and it brings goose bumps. No one says anything for fear of breaking the spell of whatever is happening, but those in the control room give each other knowing glances—but not too much, for fear of jinxing what’s happening. Often the singer is in the moment and unaware of the effect he/she is having on the other side of the control-room glass. For the next few minutes, hours, and days, you’ll be the first to hear what tens of millions will soon hear. When the session is over, you’ll play it one more time, then again and again. The singer’s song demands to be played one more time and is an addiction that stretches until the dawn. That amazing, indescribable feeling that you’re part of a hit record is like nothing I know, and it is why you do what you do. This hit will change people’s lives, including yours.
So I put in a call to the man at my church that heads up Mexico missions and said that I didn’t know how but I wanted to get involved somehow with missionary work again (I’ve been on several long and short trips to Mexico and New Orleans after Katrina) and medical missions in particular has always been an interest of mine even though I’m not in the medical field. I left a message.

All I can tell you is that I feel like I've been swimming and swimming, swimming in mud, dirt, muck, and every shade and thickness in between. It has been extremely hard for me to keep my head and attitude up above this river this time around. This has been the darkest I have felt since this whole experience has begun. I physically ache and the nausea can almost me unbearable at times and just laying there in bed seemed to take it's toll.
Today, I would like to restate the old message. I would like to remind you about what happened that day when the Lord Jesus died on the cross at Calvary. It was that event, which took place at Calvary 2,000 years ago that altered the future for every person who places their faith in the One Who died there that day. This purchased and provided salvation for every person who receives that event as their very own.

It will be the Paoli, Ind., native’s first head-coaching position. Combs became part of the Austin Peay basketball program in 1996-97 as a player.

Buy one microbrew six-pack and two six-ers of PBR (or similar swill) tall boys. After work drink a bottle of the good beer with someone you love, taking special care to note the characteristics you enjoy. Comment on them with your companion. Then drink a couple 16 oz. PBR's, noting how the flavor has little in common with beer. If you need more to drink after this, seek professional counseling. Hurry to bed, the sooner you go to sleep, the sooner you can start another day and enjoy another BEER.
If he couldn't bully me into what he wanted then the kids became pawns. Random punishment for the slightest offense. Threatening violence if they didn't do what he told them to immediately. And a complete withdrawl of his affection for them.

It was a superbly staged folkdance festival with rip-roaring dance performances coming one after another at a fast and furious pace. Spectacular is probably an understatement of the year, I believe. Showbiz Glitz is more fitting. Yah, putting on the glitz!
He asked me to take a few photos for his promotional material and this is one of them. I used a wide-angle lens (24mm) so that I could get the clogs large in the picture and keep those nice girls in focus too. These pictures were my only venture into the world of fashion photography…
Walking the peaceful woods of Fontainebleau didn't make much sense once it became clear I'd have to carry Alex on my back, so here we are, plans thwarted, stuck in Paris for the long holiday weekend.

As far as I'm concerned, if you have movies like King Kong Vs. Godzilla, Godzillas' Revenge, Destroy All Monsters and so forth in your collection and love them like your own children, Escapes is just another addition to the family...even if it is the red-headed stepchild of the group. It's still one of the gang, so you let things slide.
VY Canis Majoris is the largest star ever discovered. I was watching this show called "How the Universe Works" narrated by Mike Rowe, and I really enjoyed the explanation they had of VY Canis Majoris. Basically, it's a dying star. What keeps it burning at its center is a fusion reactor. Think of hydrogen bombs going off and you essentially understand the reaction taking place in the heart of stars.
I've heard this a lot since beginning First Person Interpretations Day at the C. Black Coffeehouse back in 2010 and feel the need to address what I think is a common misconception. There is this idea that you have to have a “character” in order to do first person reenacting. This is simply not true.
Unfortunately, if you chose your partner poorly for example out of love (either physical or brotherly) (like I did) and both of you are on different wavelengths, then unless you can get on the same path, you are doomed!
The five-pointed star also known as the pentacle, pentangle (just the star), and pentagram (any writing of 5) is the most common representation of the 5 elements. We can find the five-pointed star in many places in nature such as the apple core, starfish, flowers (5 petals), and Venus in sky. The use of the pentacle goes back as far as the Greek Pythagoreans blessing themselves with the pentacle sign.
Johannesburg - Fraud accused Thoshan Panday was admitted to hospital after experiencing chest pains in the Durban Magistrate's Court, the Hawks said on Thursday.
Tell him that abortion may or may not be murder, but that it is obviously not as bad a sin in the eyes of the Church as divorce is. If you have an abortion, or kill someone, that is a private matter between you and your priest during Confession and Reconciliation. If you get a divorce, you have to go through two years of paperwork for an annulment, processed by the nosiest busy-bodies in your Diocese, and the Bishop has to approve it. Ergo, divorce trumps abortion as far as sins go.
So one day as Alyson tapped her nail to her teeth she tasted something funny. “Wa..?” she thought, ”Was that garlic?” It was! And now our heroine was bogged down with garlic breath. The taste of garlic also started showing up in food that she ate with her hand like burgers and chips.
‘Virtual Boyfriend’ is probably the most commercial sounding track on the album and so I can understand it being released as a single (March 2011) but personally, I’m not so sure that this electro sound allows the freedom for Poly to exercise her vocal talents. It’s a little bit too kitsch for me …. which is terribly convenient as this leads (shoehorns?) nicely to the fourth track on the album – coincidentally entitled, you got it… ‘Kitsch.’
Kim Herzinger is about the coolest guy you could meet. He recently joined the staff here at University of Houston-Victoria and it was a pleasure to talk with him (though a bit intimidating, to be sure).
Bluebells feature in Rip Van Winkle style tales of people who wander into the flowers grasping at absolute beauty only to emerge and discover the world has changed by hundreds of years and everyone they knew and loved was dead. Another tale told about the bluebells is that anyone who hears them ring will soon die—although this story might have a hint of truth since the flowers are poisonous. If you find yourself disoriented in the midst of a bluebell woods with your ears ringing you might be in trouble (although scientists are poring over the chemically active compounds within bluebells to see if they have potential medical applications).

Two hand drummers sat down on the train home yesterday and started slapping their congas, praising Jesus and making their instruments sing. I couldn't help but hate them for celebrating life and having the means to do so.
If you haven't finished a book, you can't pass judgement either. You can talk up to the point you dropped it. I always finish a book - if I don't, then how will I know everything the author intended me to know? I might hate the whole book. But what if the latter third redeems everything that has gone before?
The month-long restrictions, which come into force on July 16, cover as far north as Stansted, south to Weymouth, east to the Thames estuary and west to Oxford.
This is the third book in the Chicagoland Vampires series and my favorite so far. This book had a more solid plot than previous books and things escalate both between Ethan and Merit and between the shapeshifters and the vampires. Definitely a must read if you enjoyed the first couple books of this series.
But God will not be laughing at me when it comes to my holiday. I have done zero per cent planning. I got some great advice from Emily- but apart from that, I don’t know anything else. I plan on printing out a bunch of things and read them on the plane. I hope that’s going to work to my advantage…

The dynamics are diverse for each sketchbook, you can choose whichever category you like the best, and throughout the year you can avail the opportunity to fill in that ‘recycled paper’ sketchbook with anything you feel like.

Marianne's Craftroom - 20
In my brother's case, I do know what started his slide into addiction. He was two years younger than me. He was the blue eyed, golden haired poster baby and everyone made a big fuss over him. He was always the center of attention and he could do no wrong. Then we acquired a blonde, blue eyed baby girl sister when he was 7. Suddenly, he was no longer the star of the show. Getting into trouble and punishment were new to him. Mom had remarried and our step-father was very demanding, expecting my brother to grow up and "Be a man". It warped my brother's sense of what he should be and he could not be what he thought our step-father wanted. At 15 he was already an alcoholic. He could not measure up. I know my brother blamed my sister's arrival for his problems, although he did not blame her directly. Babies have a habit of taking the spotlight away from others who seem to need it. The other thing with my brother was hypoglycemia, a pre-diabetic condition. I have also seen this to be the case in many alcoholics.

Maybe I’m blessed or lucky to have grown up with a family who supported local sports team, the Indiana Pacers and the Indianapolis Colts, and cursed that I fell into a family whom were Yankees fans. (Don’t get me wrong…I’m still a HUGE Yankees fan and going to NYC/Yankee Stadium in Mid May, but its a doozy traveling to see the boys play. Well worth it though. Makes for an even greater experience sometimes.) ((Sorry so many tangents!))
“I’m so excited about this win at collegiate nationals,” said Cinque, who has been practicing taekwondo since she was 5 years old. “I’ve won other national titles before, but this great because I actually get to represent Fordham, too.”
We were so excited about the extended time we would have together. We were in a state of perpetual bliss. And given the fact that we could actually extend our vacation romance together, we started talking about a different kind of extension… what if the Aussie could come to Canada?

It's been a fantastic, fast-moving day here. My agent phoned at around lunchtime to say that a publishing deal was on the table for my Tudor Witch Young Adult series. I discussed the finer details with him, hung up, and tried not to get too excited about the whole thing - though of course I was!

Last week, ICE conducted what has been called the largest raid in US Immigration history in Postville.

Those that have been charged have been shipped to jails all over the state and midwest. Some have been charged and released because they are the only caregiver for children at home.

In fact, it was in his other evidence, which I have omitted for reasons stated above, that there was more scope for perjured evidence to have been given. Specific questions were asked about specific events involving specific people, and specific answers were given. If these were incorrect, they would be more likely to form the basis for investigation, but unless it is purely a coincidence that the Crown Office raised matters this week, I can only foresee that it is the issues mentioned at the head of this article which are relevant.

Because of all these strengths, I loved the first 25 pages of Thief's Covenant. However, the second 25 pages, which consisted mostly of Adrienne as Widdershins pulling off a heist, didn't work quite as well for me. The problem is with the god Olgun hanging over her shoulder. Olgun gives Widdershins someone to talk to, like the daemon Pantalaimon in Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass. But I didn't find the humorous banter between Widdershins and Olgun terribly funny, although that may be because it's aimed at younger readers. More importantly, Olgun's constant presence detracts from the dramatic tension, because we know if Widdershins gets in trouble, Olgun can get her out. Marmell hasn't told us what limitations there are to Olgun's powers, but hopefully he will soon, or perhaps he will introduce an antagonist god to make matters more difficult.

Her one and only “glamor shot” was the focal point for my little layout. Paper from the “Family Fun” kit, a bit of the beautiful aqua foil sheet (one of my favorite things!), again from “Dimestore Vogue“, a border of vintage mother-of-pearl buttons…
I don't know what else to say. I need some time for self-reflection and I am not going to be doing any challenges for a while. It seems to make things worse.

Perhaps Jeddah's greatest draw is the Red Sea. We are located right on a gorgeous body of water teeming with exciting marine life. There are wonderful private beaches where, for a fee, you feel like you're in the Caribbean for a day. Plus, you can go to the beach year-round, and the water is always warm enough for swimming. It's occasionally too warm! Water sports are big here, particularly diving. Which I fully admit I have not taken enough advantage of. That's entirely my loss.
My concerns are in no way equal to these friends' at this time, but as a wise daughter once told me, we can't compare troubles. She was very sick and facing a kidney transplant, and her friends stopped sharing their concerns with her because they seemed trivial in comparison. Amanda faced off and told them that if they felt they had a lot on their plate, then they did. End of story. We just can't compare plates with someone else. Some people are facing life and death situations, but some days, a run in a pair of panty-hose as you're running late for an important interview can be a deal breaker, especially if you really need that job. I used that great insight in "Awakening Avery," when Teddie was trying to console Avery. See, art does pull from real life.

The characters are pretty well etched it. Actually so well etched out that you can associate movie which actor would be portraying that particular role. The narrative and flow of the story is pretty good as it moves effortlessly from their childhood in Varanasi to Gopal’s coaching classes in Kota to them becoming adults.

Two great games, then; if you’re a board game fan, be sure to check ‘em out. And if you’re at all interested in the hobby but perhaps don’t know a great deal about it, I strongly suggest you check out Wil Wheaton’s new YouTube show Table Top, in which he sits down with a variety of famous people (well, famous geeks, mostly) to play a game, explaining it along the way. It’s a good way to get a feel for how a game works — including the dynamic of group interaction during play. So far they’ve covered Catan and Small World.

I think that the image that instantly comes to most peoples minds when they think of homeschoolers (since most people think that all school-free learners are Christian) is a very specific one: it involves girls in long skirts or dresses, boys in dress shirts, and mothers in denim jumpers. Families with (often many) more than 2.5 children, who do their schoolwork at the kitchen table and have daily Bible study. The stereotype goes that they may also hate gay people and have a problem with the theory of evolution.

But I'm out of energy folks...I have no more defense for unschooling. I'm too busy living my own passions and trying to help my children follow theirs. I hope you find your passion too. Instead of describing what we do, what my children are exposed to precisely because they DON'T waste a bunch of time sitting in school all day, instead of using my energy in that manner, I offer you a few snapshots of our life. That's all I have any more. My camera and very few words.
She had attended literary festivals before but never on an international level and the excitement was making her nervous. Sitting under the shades of emerald-green palms writers joined together to celebrate creativity, to encourage new talents and to discuss their works. There was a different kind of intensity and devotion and a special kind of bonding. It almost felt like a spiritual quest to her. These fests provided insights that she couldn’t have found elsewhere. ‘An open platform for all to share their work’ was a fantastic idea and Ron had done a wonderful job.

Encouraging digital literacy. Sometimes small steps can be important in developing digital literacy skills. Each semester I try to help students understand how search works, and to help them become better searchers. I have tried to combine the use of online and physical resources from the library for research and historiography across the courses I teach. Likewise, I’ve started to use simple strategies such as only providing citations for work that is available through the library catalogue, requiring students to find it rather than directly linking.
The civil service and the Felda settlers in the rural constituencies have long been a backbone of the ruling Barisan Nasional and these two concerns obviously needed to be addressed before any elections can be called.

It is noted that there is demand for residential investment property, specifically apartment blocks and reference is made to a number of transactions understood to have recently completed.

The press release states:
Venerable Geshe-la says that every living being shares the same basic wish to be happy all the time. The problem is we are confused about what makes us happy. Normally, we think our happiness is a passive reaction to favorable external circumstances, so therefore when our circumstances are less than favorable we suffer. The fundamental revolution of the spiritual path is it provides us with a perfectly reliable method for building our own true happiness within our own mind that we can take with us in every situation of our life, and indeed for all our future lives.

This post is a little strange and hard to write. It's not even really a review, more just a tale about my experience with Victorian Disco Cosmetics. To cut a long story short, I had a really negative experience with the products I was sent for review. However, the owner Ashley has been really sweet and receptive to my feedback, and has already started overhauling some of the shades I had issues with. So while I'm about to detail the bad reaction I had to these shadows, I'm hoping the changes Ashley is implementing will ensure that nobody else has a similar experience to mine.
“Though we have announced that we will relaunch agitation from May, in the morning we decided to delay the agitation for two days honouring the requests of the district administration. But our people were not ready to delay the agitation. They wanted to resume hunger strike at the earliest and we are not going to stop it till the closure of the Koodankulam Nuclear plant,” Udayakumar said.
Forgiveness is the cure for anger and grudges, though, and it is an excellent cure with many benefits. People who forgive have less stress in their lives, lower blood pressure, sleep better, have a stronger sense of spirituality, better relationships, and are more loving and giving. Forgiving people are happier, healthier people. Forgiveness is good for you!
Then, I decided I should re-open my Facebook account.
I am inspired to write a bit about the nature of retail, when it is married to a greater purpose. I work for a non-profit. The money the Golden Gate Parks Conservancy brings in goes to support conservation in the bay area, education of kids about conservation, and the preservation of historic sites. This brings a different spirit into the retail enterprise. Sales associates aren’t just salespersons, they are educators, and they can transform the space into something special, not just a store but an opportunity to connect with the shared dreams of all of mankind. That may seem a bit lofty, but it isn’t an exaggeration. We will be greeting people from all over the world, who have saved their money to come see the Golden Gate Bridge. It represents many things to many people, and definitely ties into the dreams of all mankind. We have an opportunity to raise the bar as far as our interaction goes. To forge a bond. To share our enthusiasm for what life could be if we would only allow it. Our task is to find those qualities, represented by the Bridge and it’s beautiful natural setting, that all of us share and cherish, and celebrate it. It is a shame that we can’t find more of that quality in politics. I think this could serve as a good model for the ‘Occupy’ movement. Find a way forward that empowers instead of increasing the polarity and destructiveness.

Nashville is at the epicenter of the growing concern, not just about the cost of resettlement, but also about the cultural trauma experienced by communities receiving large numbers of Muslim refugees.

His new financial powers granted him avenues into New York's political scene. At first entirely uninterested in civic matters, he ran for mayor in 1880, and won, incredibly as a Democrat who also happened to be foe to the Tammany Hall forces.

It is clear, after last night, that Dan was and is the heart and soul of Augustana. It is his personality that propels the performance, giving it honesty, passion, and intimacy. I was thrilled that the set included new songs which sounded like vintage Augustana. Dan promised that somehow, in some form, this music will get out into the world, hopefully in a CD. I can only hope that he will be able to fulfill that promise. One song in particular, “Sunshine,” is still in my blood even though I can only remember snippets of the lyrics and the melody is entirely gone. Something like “shade in the moonlight,” and “right at the wrong time:” playing with opposition the way Augustana — OK, Dan — does so well.
Anyway, it is not the technicality that saw “the reverend” walk free that’s dragged me from my deep slumber, nor the crashing markets of Wall Street, Ike, alleged bonkings of the Bok coach or the third straight decent Spur ad in a row.

So what’s the beer actually like? Well it comes in the standard Brewdog 330ml bottle and is 4.7% by alcohol. It purports to be a “spiced Stout”; whatever that is. More of a Brown Ale in colour rather than a regulation Stout, it was lively and was topped with a large tan head.

During the talk, we also learnt about the three doshas (humours). These are Vata, Pitta and Kapha. I learnt that acording to their taste, different food will either increase or decrease humors in the body. One thing that was stuck in my mind is that I have to practise learning to take time to taste the food that I eat. There were times when I just eat and not bother to taste my food.

Chris’s novels, which include Dogwood, June Bug, Almost Heaven, and Not in the Heart, have won two Christy Awards and an ECPA Christian Book Award, but it’s his lyrical prose and tales of redemption that keep readers returning for more. He has also published more than 65 other books, including nonfiction and novels for children and young adults. He coauthored the Left Behind: The Kids series with Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, as well as the Red Rock Mysteries and the Wormling series with Jerry B. Jenkins. RPM is his latest series for kids and explores the exciting world of NASCAR.
It's true. I'm a sucker for exotic drawings, paintings, or photographs. It runs in the family. My mother, sisters and nieces were or are all painters, sketchers, and illustrators. Me? Almost by accident, I'm a lover of Oriental art, or arts, which doesn't mean I don't appreciate western and Islamic art.
Here is the deal with advertising on my blog...I can't keep up with it. I love the idea of it. I love supporting other small business. Especially the etsy-based ones. I just can't ever remember to takes ads down and send people renewal emails. Consider it one too many things on my plate.
MM has been a trooper through all this, too. He takes me to every appointment, actively participates, hold my hand and stays calm through every bump in the road. Even though he knew us having a baby wouldn't be a breeze, he still, I don't think, knew all that it would entail. Of course I didn't necessarily, either, as every pregnancy is different . . .theoretically. Unfortunately I'm proving to be pretty predictable at developing pregnancy induced hypertension. Well, we'll enjoy because this is most likely the last two weeks of me being pregnant in my life. Sigh.

ABC News – Yahoo News: Michelle Bachmann has endorsed Mitt Romney with a typical Bachmannism: (Mitt Romney is) “"the last chance we have to keep America from going ... over a cliff." The only woman to run on the GOP ticket, Bachmann left the race in January after the Iowa Caucus – she is noted for her work with the Tea Party from the beginning, and was responsible for rallying Conservatives to an historical win in the 2010 general election.

“I am willing to take life as a game of chess in which the first rules are not open to discussion. No one asks why the knight is allowed his eccentric hop, why the castle may only go straight and the bishop obliquely. These things are to be accepted, and with these rule the game must be played: it is foolish to complain of them.”
Lost in the Hillary Rosen-Ann Romney flap (with a side of Bill Maher thrown in for good measure) is what Mitt Romney's position has been when the subject of the debate wasn't his wife. A video has surfaced of Mitt Romney discussing his view of welfare earlier this year before the upcoming New Hamsphire primary. It's easy to locate on major media sites (and probably YouTube), so I suggest you should watch the entire exchange. The short version is that he believes that those who are going to accept aid from the government, federal or state, should in return be required to take a job so that they can share in "the dignity of work." And of course, intentionally or not he's suggesting requiring unemployed mothers to get a job since they comprise the vast majority of welfare recipients.
or there is just not 'one'
Also because someone's command of grammar does not correlate with his worth as a human being. Just because a person says, "ain't" doesn't mean she is not worthy of respect. There are educated people who should know better and when they misspeak, an internal, "Tsk tsk" might be in order, but when an older person who didn't go past eighth grade says something improper, you don't even "tsk." You just think, "Wow. This person didn't have a chance to go to school past eighth grade. I'll bet she wished she could have stayed in school rather than working as a cleaning lady to help support her family."

Here are some traditional (and some maybe just serviceable) things I've seen here, and I'll add to it.
· You pay for what you receive- up to a certain point. Usually the cheaper brands contain more wheat and rice than meat. Due to the fact that dogs are carnivorous, these foods sometimes leave them hungry and deficient in minerals.
Sometimes, it's really hard not to giggle at your child. I try, but sometimes I fail. Cause the drama? The drama is comedy.
And, the authors agreed, God help the writer who picks an animal as a victim. DeMille spoke about a novel in which his hero killed three dogs. "I had so much bad reaction," he said. "But all the murder and mayhem in the book -- no one noticed."

Here I am trying to make things work with my husband, as a Catholic and one that does not want to see her children suffer through a divorce. I am not happy in my marriage, but I am here first and foremost to serve the Lord and insure that my children are as happy as they can be. The “known” of divorcing my husband is established… misery for my children through all of that and beyond. I did marry my mother in many ways, but I can manage my husband right now. I cannot manage my mother. Not unlike my feelings of my husband on a motorcycle, I have had the same burdensome feelings for my mother. And I pray to God for forgiveness for such thoughts. The pain and anguish she causes my middle child has been so tormenting…. blatant favoritism of my oldest child over my middle child… blatant. It has caused my child to cry multiple times, including during my parents’ last visit. It is not healthy for my children to be around my mother. My father is just a controlled pawn in it all. He has to live with her and “manage” his life with her too, to minimize his misery. See the pattern here?

In the beginning of the school year, a group of students approached me and said that they wanted to start a Glee club. Their excitement was contagious. These kids were inspired by the television series, and they wanted to start auditions immediately. Their conversation was soaked with Glee references. I sat listening to them, trying to decipher the show characters from the real life students. “Can you help us, Ms. Haywood?” “Sure,” I responded. This was great. Motivated and upbeat kids with a purpose – success in the making.

When the police ask you what happened, respond and say, "That man threatened to kill me with a knife, I acted in self-defense, and I want him arrested." This makes your mindset clear... you thought he was going to kill you... your were in fear for your life... not in fear that he might hurt you or mess up your hair or clothes, but kill you.
but even so it was our best day with him yet, even though we didn't get to hold him. he is so strong & so many people have been holding him up in prayer, its no wonder he's been such a little trooper - & he's getting some good books read to him in the meantime :)

Mind you, it’s not that I am feeling delicate after Hogmanay, if that’s what you are thinking. The Scottish Hogmanay or New Year’s Eve is a notoriously hard-partying night – but we were with nice English relatives, who were extremely, well, English about it all. In fact I went to bed before midnight, without a drop of whisky. Given how tired out I was feeling, I didn’t mind much. (Well, not too much.) I was reminded, though, of a pertinent comment which I read in a newspaper a year or two ago. I thought it so true that I stuck it on the kitchen noticeboard, but I’m afraid that I didn’t make a note of who wrote it, so I must quote it unattributed:
Dr. Wayne Dyer says if we want to see the doors open in our lives, we detach from what the ego says and allow ourselves to live from the Spirit. Lao Tzu spoke about 4 Virtues that he encourages us to live by:

The thing is, the bank (aka the seller of my house) doesn't really give a crap about me. They don't care that we have had today set as my official close date for over 3 weeks. They just don't care. They don't answer to "clients" since the house is bank owned. They have no actually people on their end hollering at them to get this done. It's just me, my realtor, and my loan officer telling them this has to be taken care of. They don't care. They don't care that I had everything planned out with my close date being today. We were supposed to be over there tonight, taping everything off so we could begin panting tomorrow night and finishing by Friday. They don't care. We have a moving truck reserved for Saturday - that, if we have to cancel, we still have to pay for. They don't care about any of that.
One of my favorite parts of the Brooklyn Central Library is the video collection. The part I liked most was the surprise that it gave me. On the first glance, I didn't even think it was much. It was half the wall in the internet hall. It looked like a fraction of a chain rental store. I almost made the mistake of not giving it a chance. When I looked closer, I saw that it had a nice variety of movies that I wanted to see, had been meaning to see or enjoyed at some point in the past. After many visits, I realized why the small shelf space. In my opinion, and seeing so many other people doing the same, most of their collection is out in the hands of the people. At least, that what I like to think. But wait, their is still more.

My wonderful sixth grade language arts teacher, Ms. Brooks, once imparted to us that yes, there were indeed times when she said "shit," which shocked and amused us at first - ooooh, teacher said a curse word in class! - but in that particular case she was making a point, that just because she stands in front of a blackboard talking to ten-year-olds all day doesn't make her any less human.

The reality reflected in the documents from the Abbottabad compound is that bin Laden had been exiled by the leadership of al-Qaeda because he had come to be seen as a loose cannon who was a danger to the organization. The train of events that led to bin Laden's holing up in the compound in Abbottabad began in August 2003, in a small village in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, near the fabled caves of Tora Bora where he led a battle against US Special Forces in December 2001. It was there that the leadership of al-Qaeda conducted a series of extraordinary meetings on its most pressing problem: how to ease bin Laden out of his leadership role in the organization.

We’re in the midst of the khamsin! I expect that doesn’t resonate with most of my Gentle Readers, so let me explain. Khamsin or خمسين‎ is the Arabic word for fifty. Every April that the Good Lord sends, the wind begins to blow. And, lest you deceive your Gentle Selves, let me quickly assure you that this isn’t a placid, benignly cooling breeze that lures you into the back yard for a read or a bit of a siesta on the hammock as you sip on a nice frosty glass of sweet tea. No, thank you very much; these winds are carrying tons of dust from the deserts of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. And wait, you haven’t heard it all. These winds blow for fifty days! No need to go back and re-read that; you read it correctly the first time. I said fifty, dusty, dirty, gritty days! So, we don’t call the wind Moriah over here, we call it Khamsin. I’m fairly certain that the entire surface of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has blown into and been swept out of our flat over the past three years!

It amazes me, sometimes, how I can just plod along, moving forward in life, following the same old routines day in and day out. Get up, shower, dress for work, get breakfast, drive to work, work, drive home, fix dinner, do some household chores, watch TV in bed, sleep and the whole thing starts over again (on most days). It's habitual. It's rote. There are times when I arrive at work and don't remember large pieces of the drive! How crazy is that?

Vv. 9-10… God roars against Tyrus… “because they too delivered up captives to Edom, and because remembered not the brotherly covenant” (KJV)… The word “Tyrus” means… “to cause distress”… Breaking covenants is a sin… Tyrus broke a covenant between brethren… (Joel 3:4-7… They sold the population to Greece.) In 2 Samuel 5:11 and 1 Kings 5:7-18, Hiram the king of Tyre made a covenant with David concerning the building of the temple. Later, they turned against both Israel and Judah to make money by the selling of the slaves. There is a lesson here… wealth obtained by covenant-breaking practices brings God’s judgment. Nations have broken covenants that they made with other nations. Many employees sell secrets of the businesses they work for to competitors for money. Even in Christian circles, covenants are being broken. The Lord will roar from Zion…

Early on I mentioned my passion for all things true crime, and one of the two women revealed that she has been in many a crime show re-enactment, which of course immediately gave me visions of licking her face. Was she a star? Oh yes, she said, in one of the shows she played the actual killer. I'm pretty sure it's understood that news of this nature makes you my new best friend, and that I will now attach myself to you like a leech until I suck you dry of every bloody detail. Turns out she doesn't have a copy of that performance, but says that when her big episode airs, she gets calls from friends asking, "did I just see you strangling a child on television?" And she says yes. Yes you did.

Meanwhile, the film satisfies another noir requirement, a dark sense of humor delivered by way of hard-boiled dialogue. For all the suspense and unwholesome interactions, I found myself laughing along the way and I do believe Le Corbeau should be appreciated as a form of satire. To call it a "distant cousin" to Haneke's The White Ribbon, well, the distance is very, very great; my own middle-man references to Shirley Jackson notwithstanding. I'll not pursue this further except to say that Haneke appears to have adopted Kubrick's title as the intellectual Ice Man of cinema... minus the sense of humor.
And in the “rescue” packages, Greece, at the cost of its own future, is doing its part to keep those Germans and French buoyed.

I find it indicative of the stupidity of some of the commentators on the issue that accuse Canada of racism in their refugee policies. Canada has a wonderful refugee programme that accepts people from all over the world and of all hues. I have known Vietnamese, Colombian, Chilean, Somali, American (draft dodgers from Vietnam), Rwandan, Palestinian, Russians and know of numerous other nationals living as refugees in Canada. All were accepted on a case-by-case basis and never on the basis of their race. Some of these may have been false claims, some of these drains on the social system, but most settle in and work and live as Canadians. We are an immigrant nation and I know few people without recent historic memory of another place and identity.

You need to wear modular helmets every time you and your friends go for a road trip. There are times when the tarmac is full of stones or other things that might cause your bike to trip off. If there is one part of the body that you need to protect that would be your head. The head contains your brain which is responsible for your body’s processes and if in case you hurt your head then you need to go directly to the doctor. With the help of the modular helmet, you can limit the impact on your head and at the same time you protect other part such as your eyes, nose, mouth and others.

Armin Meiwes’ original advertisement on The Cannibal Cafe along with Bernd Brandes response was originally thought to be a joke by other members on the website but when Bernd was not seen on the website again, another member eventually reported the advertisement to the police who started an investigation. Armin was arrested in December 2002 and charged with manslaughter for which he received a sentence of 8 years in prison. The court ruled that the lighter charge of manslaughter would apply instead of murder as Armin and Bernd had recorded the entire process as a documentary while performing these acts and Bernd was 100% consensual and enthusiastic throughout the process.

We had this get-together to celebrate the end of our winter semester. With lobster coming into season, we had figured that we’d buy a bunch of them and fire up the barbecue. One of our friends had the brilliant idea to actually get some Schwartz’s instead. One thing to keep in mind, we were about two hours out of town, which means a four-hour drive just to get a bunch of meat. Which they did. And it was glorious. There are few things that can bring people together, but Schwartz’s is one of them. Just say the name and someone will lift their head and ask about it.

While I was still breaking in the New Balance MR993s my club had a 20 mile long run. We started at the Marathon start in Hopkinton and ran to Boston College. Because the MR993s were not broken in I wore my old Brooks and my feet were killing me by the time I got to BC. It was a difficult decision to go with the old shoes over the new ones to run Boston. But the MR993s made my feet hurt so bad I had considered seeing a podiatrist. The pain from the Brooks was caused more by impact than what felt like a structural problem with the New Balance. I could mitigate the discomfort from impact.
García Márquez immersed himself in a Third World consciousness to write a formally inventive novel that can also be inserted into the rich canon of protest literature. But exactly how does its protest work? How effective is it? One could argue that the book’s ultimately miserablist conclusion is also conservative; in a world that is cruel and inexplicable, where human agency is doomed to fail, how can there be the kind of political progress that, for example, García Márquez espied in the Cuban Revolution?
After the first part of the day spent watching seven young boys run their hearts out it was an afternoon stroll from Barnes to Hammersmith and back up on the opposite bank.

By all accounts Clift and Monroe were both half out of their minds on booze and pills during the torturously long location shoot and the wild vulnerability they display is probably not all acting. They'd both be ground up before you know it, just like the scores of mustangs that used to be out in these mountains. And the cowboys will be thrown up against the barb wire and neon of the west they've won, and lament there's no more hosses to rope. They've all been turned into dog food and the dogs that ate the food are all dead from old age and there you are. Mustangs gone as if they'd never been. That's progress, like the westward expansion that reaped the dust bowl. The whole final segment of roping the mustangs and Marilyn Monroe freaking out with those big doe eyes running the bi-polar gamut is so painful I had to walk away from it, keep it running on the DVR and came back for that brilliant final fade-out, with Gable and Monroe driving 'home' - wherever that is. No credits, no music, no... nothing. It's not perfect as a film but as death's desert Christmas card it's ripe with transcendental mythic inscrutability and that alone makes THE MISFITS a quiet, drunken, desperate little triumph. Set it free, set them all free, like Monroe and Clift and Gable are free, and play God here tonight.

Secondly, the store needs to get its maintenance section sorted out so we don’t have as much stock on hand. A lot of my time is wasted doing up work orders for jobs that are to simple to need a work order and all because they need parts from the store. We have a rule that any stock removed from the store requires a requisition therefore a work order, the exception being for consumables. The only problem is that we haven’t established all of our consumables just yet – or rather the new Warehouse Manager hasn’t – and so I’m stuck with raising work orders for jobs that I won’t require a history on.

Part of me wants to think the concept of The People’s Key is all a big wink-wink, that it’s not as sincerely mystical as it seems, but the other part insists that Conor Oberst long ago lost his bearings. Integrating goofy poetic monologues by Denny Brewer of Refried Ice Cream and covering topics such as the cosmos, the future, and “the essence, the basis of life,” Bright Eyes have thrown out all the down-to-earth introspection (with the exception of the truly affecting “Ladder Song”) for what is proposed to be their final album and the results can be both exhilarating and laughable. Some critics and fans have likened the album’s electronic sound to the band’s superior Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, but ultimately this is unlike anything Bright Eyes have ever done: poppy, bombastic, ecstatic, and demented.

He’d won the battle. He’d killed Arthur Pendragon, high king of men and guardian of the Round Table. Even now, his spies were looking for the Sword and the Lance. The Crown, snatched by a dragon from his uncle’s corpse on the battlefield, was rightfully his. As soon as he got his hands – hand, curse it – on the Grail, he would be strong and handsome again, and the world would worship at his feet. But now this! Another with a claim to the throne.

As you begin to discover what damage the Calamity has wrought on your world of Caelondia, you encounter several inhabitants turned to stone who never made it out alive.

When you smash her stone statue, Rucks tells you that Maud was the one who taught Kid some good manners. “Never used ‘em though,” he says.
The pink look is possibly an issue – I know pink sells well and it’s a great way of attracting girls to buy the book. It’s of some concern to me though the pink look might put some kids off who might otherwise have bought and enjoyed Shine. Someone told me that he feels my characters are very well rounded and have a depth to them that he likened to Michael Morpurgo’s characters. It maybe that eventually we move more to that kind of cover. Although to be honest, I don’t have a lot of say in that area.

At the end of this conversation, my hope was renewed. She showed us all of the numbers, all of the possibilities, and even helped me make a decision that I had been really struggling with. We could have our answer over what is causing the fluid if I were to have one, invasive test performed. A lot of people have this test done, because let's face it, not knowing for the next 26 weeks could be awful, so I get it. But when Christy asked me how I felt about the test, I told her I wasn't comfortable, I was afraid of something happening, and I just didn't know. She said, very quickly, "Okay, it's off the table!" We were then told of the opportunities that we would have in the future to see the baby as it's growing, and hopefully that would give us more answers. I love her. She's realistic, but clearly, all about this baby having life whatever the outcome is.

Next are some of my hints for storage. The next three pictures will show you how I store my fabrics and projects and why. I have a closet that hold some of my fabric and new projects. To me these are different that UFO's...Why....Because:
R loves surprises as much as I love jadeite and antiquing. I always make fun of R saying that she is like that SNL skit of the lady played by Kristin Wiig, who can't keep a surprise because she's so excited!
Also on the spa collection of Haven you can get: antibacterial foaming hand wash, antibacterial hand sanitizer, bath and shower gel, bath salts, body cream, hand and body lotion, hand cream, and linen spray.
The focus then switches to skills, with step-by-step instructions (all fully illustrated) on different techniques like sewing seams, adding zips and quilting. After each new skill is introduced, you get 1-3 simple projects to make to test out the technique (20 projects in total). Some of the projects have templates provided at the back of the book (most of which need enlarging by 300-400%) and the rest just require you to cut pieces of fabric to certain sizes.
The rules of the challenge have changed slightly. There will be a top 3 and there is a winners logo to display on your blog also, the overall winner will be able to choose two of Linnie's sheets. Anyone can enter but only those using a Whoopsie Daisy digi will be considered for the top three. However, Linnie frequently has a freebie on her site - in fact there is one there now and, not only that, she has a buy one get one free offer on, and there are always 4 digis on each sheet, a bargain at £1.99! There are so many to choose from you will be spoilt for choice.
Every once in a while you get something unexpected at a meet like this, and in Greece it came in the form of Carmelita Jeter's 10.67 dash down the track. How good was Jeter's run? Well, for starters, it was the 5th fastest time in history. Only Marion Jones (once) and FloJo (three times) ever ran faster. And when taken into account that Jeter's time came with a slight negative wind, and all but FloJo's incredible 10.49 came with winds of 1.0 mps or greater, it may well have been the second best performance ever only behind the WR itself! And take note that Marion's single better performance also came at the altitude of Johannesburg South Africa.
I’m kind of nervous about meeting his family though. What if they don’t like me? I’m sure they will. I’m a really interesting person. Wouldn’t it be funny if they couldn’t speak English? Then what would I do but my other friend said they DO speak English in Greece. They just spoke Greek before there was English, which makes sense. And anyways, it doesn’t matter because he speaks English. It says so on his page.
I don't think it is something the people who believe it ever ask. But I have. And I found out.
“I became convinced that non-cooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good,” Reverend King wrote. “No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest.”

Needless to say, ebb and flow are important parts of this song and are massively used to bring different sections and sonics of “Rascal” together. It’s such a minimal song on the surface level, so these mixing techniques are used to completely engross the listener and use what’s available in terms of engineering techniques to present a better aural depiction of available mood.
So back to my title question, which you may be wondering when I was going to get to that…Sorry, I have a tendency to float off topic. Anyways, it seems that every time I tell someone that I coach team handball, they ask, “What is team handball?” or, “Oh, that’s like racquetball, right?” That’s when I try to explain, “Well, no, it’s actually a team sport, like hockey meets soccer meets basketball.” After saying that I usually have their interest as well as their confusion. Then I explain, “It’s a really big game in the rest of the world, but not in the US. We do have a national team and a handful of club teams, oh, and sometimes it’s taught in PE classes, but other than that, we are foreigners to its awesomeness.
I felt like she just couldn’t be happy for me, because she was obsessed with weddings since we were in college and it was happening for me and not her.
Benjamin’s door was closed. Julien hesitated, biting his lip, and went into his own room.
So when the Silver Fox was on his cleaning frenzy we sorted out our walk in wardrobe and he borrowed a humidifier from the neighbours to 'see what would happen', after noting that it was kind of musty in there. He is like that. A bit of an experimenter at times.

The Gaza Hospital shows how an effective structure and dynamic narrative can accurately portray scenes of personal affliction, whilst keeping the portrayal of real events accurate. The film keeps a firm balance between politics, emotion and hope for progress. Those unfamiliar with the context of the film will gain a detailed historical account of the conflict in Beirut. While those who consider themselves experts on the subject will find interest in the personal perspectives on offer, not to mention the cleverly sought out viewpoint of the hospital itself
They believe that more needs to be done to make sure children aged between 11 and 14 in Welsh schools are developing core communication, numeracy and thinking skills. They say that despite “good opportunities” to develop key skills across all subjects, very few schools have a “coherent and well-planned” approach to their delivery. They were also critical of the Welsh Government’s Skills Framework, which “does not significantly influence planning in most secondary schools”.

Sony KDL46Z5500 – A Review
I was asked to make a couple of cards for our small town Police Chief and Deputy for National Police Week which is upon us. What fun this was! I used great cardstock sitckers from Creative Imaginations, with silver and gold star brads. These great Free Clip Art of the 2 officers was found online and I just fancy cut them and put pop dots under for dimension. On the inside of both cards, I stamped Gold stars and printed out a great sentiment. Hope you enjoy looking at these and remember all these brave men and women that put their lives in danger for us every day, no matter what the size of town.

So why will I no longer enjoy the comforting aroma of baking donuts wafting through the walls of the bakery I share a basement with? Carl shares some of his thoughts over at MassLive. In a nutshell, he says it just stopped being fun. I think most of us who start our own business say it at the outset, but I also think few actually live by the words - 'When it stops being fun, I'll get out.' Too often businesses fail or in some ways worse, they survive while their overworked owner watches the years of their life zoom past at warp speed as they play the wizard behind the curtain for 83 hours a week. Let's face it, owning your own business is a lifestyle, and anyone who tells you otherwise, hasn't done it, or if they have, it probably wasn't for long.
Next week, I think I will show you how to make something for mom....like a mini word book.
The other patient was a lovely lady who's heart arrythmia caused fainting spells (syncopal episodes) at home. With medications administered at the hospital, that arrythmia was now under control and she would probably be transferred to the floor the next day or even discharged home. We had a few nice conversations and I reinforced some of her health teaching. It was such a slow night that I finished all of my online education modules that aren't due till October and tried, mostly in vain, to help out the other nurses on the unit. A couple of them joked (semi-seriously) that I was so willingly helpful that I should transfer to their unit permanently. A nice compliment, but also a necessary trait on my home unit. Easy, easy night.
As you can imagine, this event rather traumatized me. I still am. Even though it's been over a decade since I left Hawaii, I still shake my blankets out every night before going to sleep. Just to make sure a centipede isn't curled up somewhere in there.
I just love this photo of Geoff and Iona. I found it hard as I don't normally use so many flowers and it took me ages to stick them done. The white flowers were from spotlight and are in a bunch. Due to looking silly if I laid them on the side, I used my eyelet settler to make a hole in the paper and put the stalks in and tape at the back to hold. The Big green one is prima and the rest is the new flowers from kasiercraft.

Note: I did decide to use a second can of creamed corn – and I threw in some extra frozen corn kernels (to avoid using an entire can) to balance the corn-effect. It wasn’t necessary – but, hey, it was another can used!
This bag is by a newly discovered, fantastic Thai brand called Wonder Anatomie. And although the paper Birkin is a direct Hermès copy, I see this more like an ironic tribute to the designer tote that make girls like me think investing 3000+ on a bag is money well spent. My new tote cost me about 100 pounds which surely most of you still think is way too much for a paper bag. I just could not resist the thought of how much confusion, laughs and double takes this one will end up causing.
The bug's favorites were Winnie the Pooh (DL) and Little Mermaid (DCA). Ours were probably Tower of Terror and California Screamin' (both at DCA).
By my own sometimes admittedly harsh judgement and humble opinion, Horace and Anne are right. Marcus was only conditionally right. Let me explain by borrowing more words from the wise:
Like millions of Americans, I lost my job (bookkeeping) in 2008. I filled in my time listening to/watching college level courses from The Teaching Company that I borrowed from my public library. I read voraciously. I like to say Robert E. Howard saved my life. I started reading Conan novels and I have yet to stop. I am just a little over halfway through the nearly fifty paperbacks. I also made sure I watched all the documentaries I wanted, setting reminders and waking up early to catch just the right ones. Without a place to go every day, I was driving myself mad to keep my mind occupied. It was not only an economically devastating time; it was an emotional rollercoaster, a real blast to my ego.

If you can’t imagine a book this amazing, then think of it this way. Take your religious god(s), deity, figure, or person you just think of as plain awesome (if you aren’t religious, let’s go with Chuck Norris). They drenched the book in tears of angel-ninjas and sewed it together with the fabric of the universe, each word whispered in melodious harmonies through the Medusa Cascade (Dr Who references are always appropriate), into the vortex of eternity and bound together in the light of the time continuum, covered in the brightest stars that shine in the depths of creation. (and if that didn’t make any sense, then replace the words with some form of the word awesome. E.g. Awesome awesomed the awesome in awesomes of awesomeness…)
So, Charlie kept her promise, and disappeared after the crash. But apparently, she forgot which family she’s dealing with, because Lily won’t let go. She hires a private eye to look for her. This leads to the discovery of the real Charlie! Dun Dun Dun! She doesn’t seem aware of her mom’s evilness though…
Hataway is linked to the disappearance of 27-year-old Tracy Ocasio. He was the last person seen with her when they left a Metrowest bar in May 2009.
This is not an easy record. No one said it would be.
Me: He sings funny. I can't make out the words but I'm sure it's 'cheesy lips', though it could be cheeky lips, or hips, or tips?
i did meet up with a few friends, as well. one that i worked with at the coffee shop eons ago. then i met up with my knitting buddy - she's older and wiser and always has sage advice. there was also a bit of knitting at the shop. so, basically, knitting.
Thanks for reading this and wish me luck!! xo

Here comes Spring, historically the time of year when buyers awake from the winter slumber of the holidays and snowfall, and go on their pilgrimage to look for new housing. Houses look better in Spring with green grass, blooming trees, and flowers.
Are we really living in such unenlightened times that men called ‘Richard’ can’t have a familiar abbreviation? All Dicks face an unenviable choice. Do we bear the stigma of the shortened form of our name or do we append an ‘ie’ to become a ‘Dickie’? Though I respect Dickie Davies, Dickie Bird, and Dickie Attenborough, I’ve always believed that ‘Dickie’ is the coward’s way out. It’s fine if you want to be patronised as some doddering national treasure but I want to be taken seriously as a modern vigorous Dick.
I became "a smoker" without realising it because I got labelled by Tobacco Control and it's uncharitable "charity" front groups.

I know; I gave Corman as producer a lot of carp about repackaging an Italian movie about fish men and Barbara Bach and turning it into Screamers and promising inside-out men (which there were none of). However, Corman as director gave the wanting world some recognized classics in the world of film such as A Bucket Of Blood, The Little Shop Of Horrors, The Raven, The Masque Of Red Death and many others. How can I argue with the successes of a man who can make magic with a couple of days, a few dollars and a camera at his disposal?
My obsession with the bath doesn't end there. I love soap....bars in particular. Soaps come in all kinds of shapes, smells, sizes, and even some with little pictures. In our guest bath, mom always had decorative soaps. They were for looking only. I'm still not sure why people use them. I knew then, as I know now, that I would never have them since you couldn't "use" them.
Iris’s crime is revolutionary, or at least given the era in which Hepinstall sets the story. Robert Dunleavy, Iris’s husband, is cruel both to his wife and to his slaves: “He is simply a terrible man, a brutal slave owner, a liar, and a killer.” When his finances take a turn, he cuts back on what meager medicine and clothing he provides the slaves. He has the overseer punish them for even the slightest offenses. The punishment is so severe in one instance that Iris intervenes. Dunleavy, livid, vows revenge and treats Iris as if she were property. Iris hates her husband, especially when she catches him with a young slave girl.
This was the first time I’ve actually played 10 hanchans on there in a row, so I was rather surprised to find there was actually a high score screen. ^^;

And as for the sweet spot - I love it that Edith Wharton began every day writing in bed for a few hours - no doubt while trim housemaids in starched cap and apron poked the fire, opened the draperies and brought tea in delicate Messein. You can almost catch the rustle of their silent assiduous bustle in the words with which Wharton finally found a way to populate her page.

Two of the biggest surprises at Shanghai were Kimi Raikkonen and Williams. Raikkonen did well in qualifying and put the Lotus in 5th, starting 4th. After a brilliant drag race down the pit lane with Lewis Hamilton, Rakkonen fell back and finished a disappointing 14th, after being walloped by a quarter of the grid, in 2 laps. The other big surprise of the day was Williams who went from bringing up the rear in 2011, to a serious mid-field contender in 2012. Both Bruno Senna and Pastor Maldando had excellent drives, finishing 7th and 8th, ahead of Ferrari. Williams and Sauber are definitely mixing things up for the rest of the grid, this season.

I have heard ideals of peace and truth preached from religious leaders, friends, and musicians, but I find it difficult to hold everything together long enough to move forward with a coherent and consistent set of actions. I empathize with friends during their tough times, but I find it hard to imagine that actual people occupy the other cars during rush hour. I study hard when I see a clear path to knowledge, but I run away when I encounter confusion. I am a characteristically tenacious and loyal friend, yet I still struggle to keep in touch with those who matter most to me if distance divides us.
Maybe it’s just these two episodes, but Chizuru seems to have changed a little bit. Love got to him~. He still seems a little bouncy, but ever since Mary stepped into the spotlight I think he calmed down a bit…I noticed that now after comparing him to what he was last season. I also think Chizuru should have his hair down. He looks better that way, don’t you guys think? d:

Past years, it was very difficult. I spent four birthdays with infertility. Three years ago on my birthday I ovulated, which resulted in a pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. I've thought of that baby on my birthday every year since then. That was the farthest I'd made it before V. That one was the most traumatizing.

I used to laugh my head off when people tried to make animal noises in the circus. Most humans are only any good at mimicking dogs and pigs. The English aristocracy are not too bad at horses. Only men with very deep voices are capable of sounding like a gorilla. Tom Jones is one, and Davy Attenborough managed to imitate some of our grunts after soaking his scrotum in rum. I remember a pie-faced fellow trying to impress me with “Ook! Ook!” noises after watching me perform in the ring. He was hopeless.
This time, Danny's a college student as well as a tycoon's playboy son, and Dad (Henry O'Neill) cancels his return to Yale and sends him to his own alma mater "out west" (Cody College, the state unspecified). There, under the eye of Cody's dean (Guy Kibbee), he is the usual fish out of water, smitten with the dean's grandaughter, postmistress Ginger Gray (Judy). (I wonder: was the changing of the heroine's first name a wink to Broadway's original Molly, Ginger Rogers? How could it not be?)
Where the Orangutan Forest now sits, turned out to be a very heavily populated ancient graveyard. But as ancient graveyards aren't covered in the same way as ancient buildings, these were all quickly yanked out and disposed of.

We need to ensure that the oft quoted words of Voltaire are upheld as a way of life for the preservation of all our freedoms. We may not agree with what other people say, but we must fight for their right to say it, even, nay especially, when it is hurtful and thereby challenging. If we allow censorship on any issue, we give credibility to those who wish to silence debate on the Holyhoax, Man-made Climate Change, the Money System, Zionism, Palestine, and indeed every issue which the Establishment seek to control. This isn't the first time that Icke has travelled the censors' road. If alarm bells were ringing in the background, they have gone up a few decibels. Maybe his close relationship with Alex Jones isn't so peculiar afterall...
