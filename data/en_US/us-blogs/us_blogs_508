My final website has 5 functioning web pages, and the 3 Javascript elements all working as they should. You can change the colour of the font, the size of the font, and the type of font. Initially I was going to change the background colour for a bit of variation, but it turns out it would have been too difficult to do with how the css and html interacted with eachother, although there are no known compatibility issues between IE7/6 and Firefox. Overall i’m pleased with the result, now I just have to write my evaluation and double check that the validation checks out! Hooray!
And it’s a shame how vehemently some sports writers attacked Paterno for this because Jerry Sandusky is alledgedly the real culprit here. There is no doubt about that. Sandusky is the villain in this case as he alledgedly terrorized, abused and raped at least eight young boys causing irreparable harm on their lives forever.

You might just have been able to dismiss this as a faux pas - you can't and shouldn't force anyone to drink what they don't want, and this could just be an unthinking oversight in a wedding where every single choice of decoration, clothing, dinner service and music is being analysed and dissected to discover it's meaning and symbolism.
But, to return to my theme: most company mission statements are, frankly, gibberish. For some reason, business people cease to be human beings when faced with the task of defining their company’s mission statement, becoming company clones with MBAs in Empty Platitudes. And it doesn’t matter how many staff consultation workshops they run: the result is still as meaningless.

As I have said on many occasions, we do not live in an abstract or theoretical world. We live in a world in which our clients face very real threats to their health and financial well-being. I believe that we have an obligation to have frank discussions with our clients about life insurance products that can have a meaningful impact during their lifetime, as well as at their death.
Congestion can also happen due to non-recurring highway incidents, such as a crash or road works, which may reduce the road’s capacity below normal levels. Economist Anthony Downs, in his books Stuck in Traffic (1992) and Still Stuck in Traffic (2004), argues that rush hour traffic congestion is inevitable because of the benefits of having a relatively standard work day.

CHOUTEAU - Word Fellowship auctioned off a rare item Sunday at the annual Jamboree Auction - a signed ball by the members of the Holy Hitters.

Last March the United States Breastfeeding Committee (U.S.B.C.), supported by national birth and breastfeeding organizations as well as state and regional organizations sent a letter to six federal legislators urging the Federal Government to fund specific activities recommended by the U.S. Surgeon General to effectively increase breastfeeding rates. CIMS, a member of the U.S.B.C. felt strongly that this national outreach to policy makers was vital for implementing these recommendations and signed onto the letter to the six legislators.

Kip was selected by the Chicago White Sox in the first round of the draft in 1998. He made his MLB debut on August 9, 1999 against the Detroit Tigers, winning his first outing. Wells would go 20-21 for the Sox over three years before he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates after the 2001 season.
I moved on to Thor, and had a much more enjoyable ride. The combination of humour and the sprawling fantasy of Asgard is much more up my street, and the emotional trials of Thor’s family situation, and his feelings for Jane really made me root for the characters (including Loki despite his evil-doing; Tom Hiddleston steals the show). Not my favourite film ever though, so I was hoping that Avengers would take everything good from these two films, combine with a bit of Tony Stark bad-ass-ness, and make a super-hero-filled pile of fun.
Midnight Haze was sold as a six-year-old by breeder and then trainer Philip Dando at Doncaster in August, 2008, for £22,000 after winning his debut bumper at Worcester in June. Scored for the first time over obstacles more than a year later when he took a novice chase at Kempton in November, 2009. He sustained a hairline fracture of the cannon bone when winning at Wincanton the following February, which truncated his season, but returned in November, 2010, with another success, at Ludlow. Has raced only twice this term, winning at Ludlow on his favoured easy ground before a sixth place in the cross- country chase at the Cheltenham Festival in March. His sire is best-known for high-class staying chaser Midnight Chase but his maternal family is less exalted; his non-thoroughbred dam Gypsy Haze, a sister to triple hunterchase winner Bill Haze, was a point-to-point winner. Race Record: Starts: 15; 1st: 5; 2nd: 2; 3rd: -; Win & Place Prize Money: £29,081

I’m a late blooming book nerd. I returned to children’s books in my 20’s. Though I had read books as a child, it wasn’t until I read them again as an adult that I felt moved by an indescribable “something.” Now I can’t get enough. When I was a kid, the stories I remember best, the stories I begged to hear, were my Mom’s stories. I used to lay in bed with her and ask her to tell me a story. She always had something to share about her own childhood. For years I’d hear some of the same stories over and over again. One of my favorites was about her father, my grandfather, whom I’d never met. When she and my Dad were first married, my Mom’s father lived with them in their two-bedroom apartment in Philadelphia. There was a courtyard where all the kids would play. One day, my Mom looked out into the courtyard and saw my Grandfather lying on the ground, his shirt open. The kids where gathered around him. Panicked, my Mom ran downstairs. When she approached, she saw that the kids had a toy doctor’s kit out and my Grandfather was the patient. They were all laughing and having a wonderful time!

This journey has been painful and it has sucked in every possible way, and some of my days have been dark and filled with much sadness, but I have been able to find ways to turn all that nastiness into a whole heck of a lot of good. I have said it before, but I will say it again, I am calmer, happier, and more fulfilled than I have ever, ever been. I am so sorry if I ever made it sound easy. It hasn't been easy, but it has been worth the fight.
It's all well and good when mom is home and can let the kiddos sleep in. But it won't be OK when that bus rolls up at exactly 7:43 a.m. a couple of weeks from now. And I know from previous experience, switching up bedtime routines and sleep schedules doesn't happen over night!

- After a year of trying to disconnect from the universe at large, this whole "no laptop" thing is beginning to seriously grate on my nerves. So much so, in fact, that as I was walking to the bus last night, I very nearly walked into Best Buy and handed the computer nerd my Visa with instructions to give me anything under $500 with MS Office pre-installed. I know I should have just bitten the bullet already, but what with my well-earned reputation as a miser, I wanted to wait awhile to see how badly I thought I actually needed a laptop before shelling out the dough for a new one -- especially when I technically have a working desktop at home (though I'm pretty sure it dates back to the Paleolithic Era). As it turns out, I DO actually need one, for my sanity if nothing else. And so, the search for a new laptop begins.

Can we decide right here, right now that this battle ends with us? Can we say to the corporations and the politicians that we’re willing and ready and able to do whatever it takes this time, to bring into being what was once considered impossible? Can we say to the system of oppression that the tear gas and the batons and the riot shields and the rubber bullets and the beatings and the arrests and the court dates and the prison terms will not stop us from giving birth to the impossible. Can we say with some certainty that we’ll die to make the world a better place if we have to? Can we say that nothing will keep us from finally having a hand in remaking the world in our own image? Can we sacrifice our time, our education, our career, our family, our friends, our future to see something better? Can we risk everything NOW so that the next generation can be without the burden we were forced to inherit? Can we become the generation of sacrifice? Can we be the ones to say it ends with us?

And does science really seek to “reinforce what we already think”? If that were true, science wouldn’t progress. (In contrast, faith does seek to reinforce what the faithful already think, which explains why, while theological doctrine may change, it doesn’t progress.) Indeed, science seeks to test, or even to overturn, what we already think. Think of all the excitement attending the now-dubious finding of faster-than-light neutrinos.

In Africa, people don't believe in the Tooth Fairy. Instead, they have the Tooth Mouse. In Spain: Ratoncito Pérez. In France: La Bonne Petite Souris. A tiny magical rodent that steals teeth and replaces them with spare change. In some culture, the lost tooth must be hidden in a snake or rat burrow to prevent a witch from finding and using the tooth. In other cultures, children throw the tooth into a roaring fire, then, later, dig for coins in the cold ashes.

Nearly a month ago I went through my ever busting-out closet and thought I had really done well. This was the time,……. even purses and shoes; even that black pair of slip on clog-like ones that I pull out every year for which I hate. I let them all go…joyfully! After several (meaning more than three–lots more!) black garbage bags (to hide the evidence) taken to the Goodwill drop off station, I swear if it doesn’t appear to still be too full. I have a date with that room and this time I will keep no alliances…I will never fit into those clothes again and if I do its time to be out of the ’90′s!
Lervigs Jul is a Christmas beer with 6.8% alcohol. In the glass, this is a cloudy coppercoloured beer. There is a medium sized head, but nearly no carbonation. In the nose I feel toffee and grapes. The beer has as sweet taste with some toffee and a touch of tutti frutti bubble gum. The finish is boring, as the tastes more or less disappear. Lervigs Jul is a fine Christmas beer, but it is not among this season's best.
So you can see from the line number one, the inbound port numbers have been set to 80, and the IP address of the ethernet shield has been set to 192.168.0.77 – the same as in the sketch. After saving the settings, we’re all set. The external address of my ethernet shield will be the WAN:80, e.g. 213.123.456.128:80 into the browser of a web device will contact the lonely Ethernet hardware back home. Furthermore, you may need to alter your modem’s firewall settings, to allow the port 80 to be “open” to incoming requests. Please check your modem documentation for more information on how to do this.

I started the blog as a "virtual baby book" for Olivia and to keep family and friends up to date on our life, and that's still who a majority of my readers are. But then I met my amazing January mama friends, and they introduced me to a bigger blogging community.

I live in a Subdivision called Hamilton on Hunter. It’s huge. It’s a mile and several turns from my house to the main artery, Hunter Road. There are a pair of TVA Power Lines that run right through the middle of Hamilton on Hunter. Sometimes you can spot deer in the cleared areas below them.

The first problem is that ocean currents don't behave the way Warmists want. There is nothing steady about them. It is true that several La Nina (cooling) events have happened in recent times but they alternated with "neutral" and warming (el nino) events. Fear not, however! With statistical averages we can maybe smooth that out. And so to the article below.
A campaign by the student wing of South Africa’s official opposition party is just perfect for a country that has an all inclusive Constitution; and so why the big deal? Well the Ad has caused a storm and depicts a black woman embraced by a white man. Judging by the social network comments, it would seem, sadly, that SA may not be ready to embrace true post racism post apartheid as it forges into reality; and yet worse it may still be stuck in mud of Calvinistic persuasion that pervaded apartheid’s reign! But what about the recognition of same-sex relationships? Is that going to far?
Once told they could not proceed, Eisner said, “the activists tried to block the Jordan Valley road.

I devoured Savita Kalhan’s debut novel, The Long Weekend, in a couple of hours. Aimed at over 12 year olds, The Long Weekend is a gripping and terrifying read which is not only a first rate reality horror story, but also a singularly cautionary tale about the terrible things that can happen when you accept a lift from a stranger… Without being overly explicit, The Long Weekend is a warning to children about bad men.

I wanted to tell her, she was wanted, by many and not just for her beauty.
What did Jesus say about His scriptures? Jesus said that He will send scribes (Matt. 13:52, 23:34). The scriptures were written by Apostles and prophets. According to the Gospel of John, Jesus prayed for all who would hear the Word by the Apostles (John 17:20-21). In John’s gospel, Jesus addressed the “Father” in prayer saying that Jesus had given the words of the Father to the Apostles (John 17:8, Acts 1:2). Jesus also said that those who kept His word would keep His Apostles also as Jesus said in John 15:20, “If they kept My word, they will keep yours also”. With confidence in Jesus’ words to the Apostles, Christians do not find it difficult to accept the New Testament as the eternal words of Christ. According to John’s gospel, Jesus said that the words He spoke are spirit and life (John 6:63), and He stated that He would not judge the world but that His words would (John 12:47-48). Evidently, Jesus’ words are very important and vital to one’s salvation. In the synoptic gospels, Jesus said, “My words will not pass away” (Matt. 24:35, Mark 13:31, Luke 21:33), which words are found in other place than in the New Testament scriptures. Believers are convinced that Jesus being resurrected came to Saul, who is later referred to as Paul. The Apostle Paul said, “Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Spirit teaches; combining spiritual things with spiritual words” (1 Cor. 2:13). Followers of Christ are confident in following the New Testament scriptures as being the words of Christ. Looking to Jesus’, He accepted the Old Testament collection as was delivered to Him and to the Jews of the 1st century. Jesus did not doubt God that the Old Testament collection was guided by God’s providence, since being God He knew the workings of God. Therefore, there is no reason to reject the New Testament writings as delivered to them.

MAC Fresh Amour Mattene is a light, white blue-toned lavender that can be incredibly hard to wear. On its own it's like Nicki Minaj jizz lips, but if it's rubbed in a bit or worn with a pink lipstain/liner/gloss it's infinitely more wearable. It's also incredibly creamy and feels lovely on the lips, even though it has a matte finish.

Yes, it is targeted to teens and tweens. Yes, I, a 30 year old physician, was glued to my iPAD watching a teen drama show on high school gymansts for 45 minutes, periodically glancing behind me to see if anyone could see what I was watching, because that would’ve just been embarrassing! Those dang ABC Family shows just suck you in! Not a bad problem if you’re just trying to battle your way through a workout on the elliptical. Unfortunately at the end of the episode just when this bit*& girl’s father was about to bribe the coach into letting his daughter on the team, my ipad died. That’s why my elliptical workout was a random 46 minutes. I cannot survive on a stationary piece of equipment without major distractions.
Life Lesson: Jesus Christ will enable and empower you to minister in His directives.
Here I am, half way through my undergrad career (I would say “college career,” but with a Masters and Doctorate to go, that’s a bit of a stretch), and I have realized more things about myself. As I think about it, I am prompted to write an expansive post cataloguing the manias and themes that have pervaded my adolescent and young adult life – the fashions I thought were valid, the causes I thought were legitimate, the values I found important, and so forth. But that’s, as I said, a different entirely. Summing up the paragraph, and getting this post back on course, let me just say that, ”While I’ve always criticized the cultural ideal of ‘searching for one’s identity,’ and ‘finding oneself,” I have certainly traveled along that road, and I’ve noticed a great many changes that should probably have their own blog post.”

The silk printed dress is unlined with an exaggerated batwing sleeve. I admit that when you have a larger bust, this kind of sleeve probably does little to "flatter" in the traditional sense. I liked the print too much to care. The style is cut larger so you can size up or down. I am wearing a size 8 and belt or layer with cardigans to make it a little less billowy. It has ample room in the bust, waist, and hips so you can size down if you prefer.

The line between writer and crazy person is very thin. Both go around holding long, involved conversations with people who aren't there.
I fire a text off to you and sometimes expect instantaneous response. But even if it doesn’t come, I feel virtuous. I have communicated with you . . . minimally, of course, but in the latest mode, and often while supposedly occupied doing something else: listening to a lecturer, walking with my kids (last week, I saw a woman pause in mid-restaurant-doorway with her three children and a pram, so she could hold her phone outside for good reception for her text), even driving my car or bus or subway train.
I'm off tomorrow to get some things taken care of. Important things like Pedicure, Eye-brow Wax, and Hair cut/color.. can't be having this baby looking like a hot mess..
One thing my summary doesn't capture is how freaking funny this book is. I could name a dozen scenes that had me laughing out loud, and the loose, anything-can-happen structure of the book reminds me of my favorite seventies movies. And if you have lived in Texas for anytime at all, McMurtry's descriptions are going to bowl you over. From drunken, academic Austin to swampy Houston to the dry expanses of West Texas and the contradictions of the Valley, McMurtry knows Texas.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place sprouts in bowl, drizzle with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Carefully toss until well coated with the oil. Spread on baking sheet. Place in oven on middle rack for 35-45 minutes, shaking pan every 7 minutes to cook all sides evenly. Cook until dark brown, almost black…this is the carmelization that is deliciously sweet and savory! So good! So easy!
Kristal over at Getting Cricky is hosting a link up party this week. It's a great way to meet new people and find new inspiration. For this month's party, she asked that we post our favorite fall/Halloween project.
I love Christmas movies and Christmas decorations. I love yummy Christmas food and Christmas candy and Christmas drinks. I love joyful Christmas songs and the beautiful Christmas cards. I love the cool Christmas weather and the sweet fragrance of Christmas spice in the air. I love vivid, colorful wrapped Christmas presents under the Christmas tree-what a sight.
Not a movie for teens, methinks. The message is: The teens are in control. You will get what you want (from your parents) in the end. We are living in post-parental-authority times. And not only that. The CLEAR message is: You can be as wild as you want as a teenager. You’re SUPPOSED to be bad. Do anything you want. Drinking, drugs (not too many hints at teen sex--almost avoiding?). Nothing bad will happen to you. You will “outgrow” it unscathed. (Bad things only happen to parents and adults!) Once again, Hollywood chants its mantra: NO CONSEQUENCES.
However, these problems didn't prevent me from enjoying the story. While I think it could have been better, Clockwise is still a good read. I was emotionally connected to the characters, the plot was quick and interesting, and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. I definitely recommend fans of time-travel to check this book out.
In four years time I will be half a century old. This just isn't fair, I feel about twenty. All the cardio, weights, boot camps, hiking and running I do can't stop my body wearing out and the fact that my eye lenses are no longer as flexible as they were is the first indication of my inevitable decline.
The TED video is here. It is interesting that introversion tends to cultivate leadership and creativity. In a commercialized society like Hong Kong, extroversion is highly valued and (I think) overstated. It is very frustrating to know that my Hong Kong peers rarely do real reading. By “real reading” I mean reading that inspires contemplation and enriches one’s knowledge of how this world works.
And MOST IMPORTANT of all - (well VERY exciting for me) this week you started saying Mama!! You started by saying 'Ma' for a few days, then it progressed to Mama, and my heart melted :)

BHP took up the opportunity, breaking the mould from sponsoring purely sporting endeavours. In 1986 their first sponsorship money was used to purchase a french horn, trombone, bassoon and oboe. Scholarships were also set up for students to get tuition on these instruments, paying fees of the instrumental tutors.

We have the opportunity of developing a critical mass of citizen journalists dedicated to truth and honesty in news reporting from which the MSM may have no other choice but to “follow suit” if more readers demand it.
Last night I ended up DJing back at The Sherman (I was playing there last week for a French street dance show called Elektro Kif also) for the opening night of ‘A Provincial Life’, a retelling of Chekhov’s short story put on by National Theatre Wales, which has been brilliantly adapted by Peter Gill. The play is based in 19th Century Russia and revolves heavily around themes of work and class, so I was asked to pick a whole selection of tracks based around ‘work’ (thankfully they didn’t have to be Russian as well or I might have struggled a bit more than I did). Although I didn’t get to play them all, much fun was had picking them so here’s just a handful of my favourites.
New friends were met. Old acquaintances were reestablished.
Summit is not a miracle cure. But for 50 years in America and for 21 years in South Africa, it’s been a trusted source for preparing students to be the kind of leaders who shape culture, rather than who are shaped by it. That’s why Evangelical leaders such as Dr James Dobson, Dr James Kennedy, Charles Colson and Josh McDowell endorse it so enthusiastically — and why they sent their children to Summit USA before college. There simply is no substitute for the excellent training and mentoring participants will get at the Biblical Worldview Summit (30 March - 5 April 2012).
Some interesting facts about shad:
In In re Cox Enterprises, Inc. , Serial No. 76591278 (January 12, 2007), the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board affirmed that the mark "THEATL" was merely descriptive for magazines, a weekly newspaper, and a section of a newspaper:

I was getting tired and thinking that I really should make my way back to recognizable sights. I sat down on a rock that was right next to a tree. The rock was just the right height and the tree was perfect for leaning against. I don’t know if I fell asleep or was just in that in between stage between awake and sleeping. But I came to with such an awareness that I had to rush back to my car where I could write down what I had seen, dreamed, experienced, all the time dreading that I would forget it before I got out of the woods.
Sigh. That's all I can do is sigh.
Or, our morning.
The children played on in the courtyard. The youngest child wore on his breast the gold star that had topped the tree on its happiest night of all. But that was no more, and the tree was no more, and there's no more to my story. No more, nothing more. All stories come to an end.
In early 2011, Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) requested an ATF briefing. The agency refused. Congress has now issued a subpoena summoning ATF to report on the Fast and Furious program.

2011 was Red Bulls first year with KERS, having chosen not to run it in 2009 as it compromised their design too much. As is typical for Newey, Marshal and their design team the KERS installation was unique and uncompromising, with its energy storage in two packs either side of the gearbox and a smaller unit inside the gearbox. Reliability issues plagued the team throughout the year, with the batteries succumbing to heat and vibration.

Now, first off I must say that I feel quite bad for the researchers who had to slog through thousands of Tweets, where they had to microanalyse each one. I myself do not follow anything on Twitter because I can’t stand reading about the minutiae that makes up the average Twits life. For researchers to do this…I must really give them kudos for their patience and perseverance.

I have to figure out the balance between getting things done (and making sure the boys are involved in this) and having fun. Without completely exhausting us all.

On January 31st they appeared as the special musical guests on Fox’s hit TV series GLEE where they performed “Smooth Criminal” in the Michael Jackson tribute episode. This was the first time that an instrumental duo had performed on the show in this coveted guest spot.

Instead of developing the ostensible main character, the book focuses on the three sisters and Edie becomes just a set of eyes, an outsider stand-in for the reader who does a lot of telling instead of showing. Morton wants to deliver a mystery, to make us wonder about how these three women came to spend their entire lives in a decaying castle. But the “mystery” of it all is laid on so thick that we learn next to nothing about the characters until the final act. By then, I cared little for Saffy and Percy Blythe or the origins of the mysterious Mud Man. These people even edit their own thoughts to keep us from discovering their secrets (which, by the way, are not even that scandalous or surprising). The only one with any semblance of depth was Juniper Blythe, who had some vivacity in her early appearances in the novel as a young girl, but is rendered into a Jane Eyre Bertha-esque specter in Edie’s present-day interactions with her. As Morton keeps us from the secrets, whole chapters end up feeling like treading water. I kept telling myself there’d be some kind of shocking payoff, but there wasn’t. t can hardly believe the same person wrote both these books.
First and foremost, I want to know what you write. I must admit, I've been pretty selfish when it comes to contacting agents about doing these interviews. For the most part, I've concentrated on agents who rep YA, fantasy, and sci-fi, since that's what I write. In the future, though, I want to interview agents who rep things that are more proportionally representative of the genres you write, so let me know in the comments (even if you write the same things I do, because you might never see another YA/fantasy/sci-fi agent again otherwise:) ).

I have worked as hard as anyone in the industry and have played my part in generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue for agencies and clients. A lot of profits have been made as a result of my efforts. All that being said, my compensation has always been salaried with a small percentage of my salary coming as a bonus some years. And by small percentage, I'm talking 10% maximum and as an overall average through the years more like 3%-5%. Regardless of how much revenue I generate or how much profit a client might make as a result of my efforts, I know as a media buyer that I will never make $500,000 a year, nor should I.
“We are in sales,” says Greg. “That’s what we do. That’s how we roll.” Greg and I rolled to Starbucks this morning so we could accomplish an impromptu chore only worthy of the sales bitches. He leaves that fact out of his monologue.

My workout today was pretty tough again, but thankfully pretty uneventful from the kids side!! I went to bed pretty late last night (so stupid!!) was pretty tired when I got up this morning and was REALLY hoping the kids would nap at the same time so I might catch a quick nap also!! My Wednesday mornings are always kind of rushed because my daughter goes to a church class every week and she is thrilled from the time she wakes up until we pull into the parking lot!! So generally, I'm trying to go through the morning routine with her literally following me from room to room asking, 'we go to church today?!' and then she proceeds to give me my 'to do' list before we can leave.....maybe talking to her so much during the day is starting to bite me in the butt a little???

Think about that concept for a moment. We have a hijacked Vernal Equinox celebration of the start of Spring. Baby sheep and new flowers needed Jesus dying on a cross to make them more special apparently. Religion has never been something to follow logic. We're talking about the people that believe the Earth was created in 4004 BC, on a Tuesday. Yet, Easter, one of the most important events in the religious calendar is based on the lunar cycle.

Cons: This should have been a stupid fast project, but I ignored the instructions for hemming everything (bottom, sleeves, neck) and first tried hemming with a twin needle, which I loved, but it skipped on occasion. Then I switched to banding, which was bad. I pulled on the sleeve bands and they ended up kind of tight on my biceps. And I'm no Hulk! So then I didn't pull on the neck band and it ended up loosey-goosey. Since it doesn't look bad I'm going to leave it but I know better for next time. The pattern itself just calls for a narrow hem. All this banding meant the dreaded hand sewing and that's why it took 4 hours instead of just 2.

It is the law of the jungle that prevails for most part. The bigger the vehicle the greater right it has to hog the road – any side of it. But the motorcycles are the hyenas of this jungle – they do not care even for the tigers or the elephants. They steal the crumbs – the empty parts of the roads – from the mighty trucks with impunity. Some hyenas lose their lives, but then, in a jungle that is to be expected, now and then.

Aside from the fact that robots are now encroaching on even more people’s jobs, what are the philosophical implications for art? When a robot draws something, who’s the artists: the robot or the person who programmed the robot? Also, if robots learn to understand and appreciate art on their own, how much closer does that bring them to being just like us?
In order to continue my education, tomorrow I'll be practicing at home with my pal Dr. Dance, who has been taking lessons for over a year and is a student in Intermediate 2. Dr. Dance has a great sense of humor, with Look at you! being his phrase of choice.

One of his finest homes, the Merritt home, introduced Gregory to the Merritt family, and later his daughter, Clara would marry C.H. Merritt. The First Methodist Church has a memorial stained glass window to the Gregory family’s memory. Hampson Gregory died in 1922 and is buried in Park Cemetery. Today, nearly a century after his death, Gregory’s true memorial is the many homes and public buildings he built and which still stand today. The Mining Journal was correct—he remains one of the men most responsible for building Marquette.
I'm not categorically against heroes dying. One of my all-time favourite films is Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, which has one of the most famous heroes-peg-it endings in cinema history.

Suddenly breeding special species of human beings has gained currency amongst intelligentsia in the country! A leading film star, John Abhram made waves by declaring that every third girl in the country is dying for donor sperms to raise a progeny which will be a class apart in terms of macho looks and brawn! The IVF clinics in the country are having a field day in making tall claims and promises for those without kids! Lord Krishna’s elder brother Balrama was born to parents Devaki and Vasudeva as their seventh son.
He appeared broken down, fatigued, but he smiled back anyway. I handed him one book and he asked in English, “Who is this for?” And I said it was for me, “Rigoberto.” I handed him the other book. “And this one?” he asked. “It’s for me also,” I said. He looked up at me and laughed, so I laughed with him, not understanding why that was so funny. I knew my time was up, but I went for it anyway and said to him before I was turned away, “Yo soy de Michoacán. Yo también voy a ser escritor.” He humored me and answered, quite gently, “Pues, suerte, muchacho. Nada más cuídate los dedos.” He raised his hands up to show me and I was stunned: he had crooked index fingers. Many years later, I would read how he continued to write on a typewriter, using only those two digits. Another lesson I would come to learn about being a writer: its physical toll.
Tomorrow evening, Jews around the world gather to retell and celebrate the Exodus. At some seder tables, undoubtedly, there will be some allusion to the sufferings inflicted on the Palestinian people, in our name. But I don’t think that can suffice. Our hopes and efforts really imply a new Exodus, out from the Occupation mentality, the Mitzrayim, that justifies such cruelty and the doing to others what we ourselves have found so hateful that we have retold its story for thousands of years. I spoke of Jewish activism as –educative– from the Latin to lead out. I see Jewish activism here and in Israel as leading out from the idea of tikkun olam toward a new evolution of Jewish consciousness, not only against the Occupation but in solidarity with all who are trying to liberate themselves. Let’s not deceive ourselves: this is not a simple or straightforward movement. It’s a long sojourn in a different kind of desert, a sojourn to be shared with others, and I believe the people of Jewish Voice for Peace are part of its reality.

There is so much more to say, but not to be over-looked was Stott’s personal interest in helping the poor and downtrodden. This was eventually worked out in a thorough evangelical conviction about social concern and evangelism. I was interested to note that both Steer and Stott considered “The Cross of Christ” as his finest and most important book. Of course, the contribution this book makes to a clear understanding of penal substitution as central to the many faceted ways in which the cross may be viewed and the penetrating application of the Scripture’s teaching on what was achieved by God through the work of the cross must not be denied. However, I wonder whether enough has been made of the huge impact of “Issues Facing Christians Today” in encouraging a biblical vision for the poor and the alienated alongside the need for effective evangelism. I know that for me, reading “Issues” was a life transforming experience.

When a threat is detected, the amygdala sends notifications to other parts of the brain to put us into fight, flight or freeze mode. Chemicals race to our extremities to make us stronger and quicker (or, in the case of freeze, so much that we imitate death by freezing) and into our higher brain to shut things down. These chemicals in motion are what I call “the whoosh.” And yes, as I said, part of their job is actually to shut down the active functioning of the pre-frontal cortex. This is where we think, plan and make productive choices.

No matter how great the hurt, no matter how great the tribulation, there is always a part of us remains untouched. That is our authentic being. It needs no image.

All Fear-Selves, no matter how refined they might be, are ultimately images.

I originally started playing them a few years back when I was still in college. I had saw the anime on Cartoon network a few times in the past and thought the idea of it in game form would be so cool. Finding out there were games really made my day! I think my parents bought me the first 2, Infection and Mutation. Unfortunately, it was hard to track down the last two. Part 3 (Outbreak) I managed to find in the used bin at ones of the game stores that weren't transformed into Game Stop yet, but it was months before I could find the final one, Quarantine. By the time I found Quarantine though, I had already beaten Outbreak for awhile now and had gotten a bit bored. So I figured I'd go back to it eventually.

One thing I've learned in my almost 25 years of following Christ (Friday is my spiritual birthday) is that you can't teach gratitude--it has to come from within. As I mentioned on here a little over a month ago, I'd just lost my job, but thanks to a couple years of diligent food storage efforts, my family won't have to worry about food for several months. I started a new job almost two weeks ago, and I'm very grateful for it. The downside at the moment is that while it's a full-time job, I took a significant pay cut from my previous job and the wages at my new job will cover everything except gas and food costs. Now, I could be ungrateful for the fact that I'm shorter on cash than I'd like to be, but I have a little bit of cash to fall back on and, to emphasize the point again, no trips to the grocery will be needed for several months except for milk and (until we start making our own) bread, because we have plenty of food on hand. Now, at some point, our income will have to exceed our expenses, or else our reserves will be depleted--so from the perspectives of some people, I'd have every right to be upset. But let's think back to basic math--half of something is more than nothing, right? I'd rather have a job at half of my previous salary than nothing at all! Keeping at least some cash flowing in is stemming the financial blood loss, so to speak, and I'm very grateful for that!

Then churn the chocolate mixture then spread over the blackberry ice cream, allow to set for two hours, and then repeat with the raspberry mixture. Then cover with the overhanging plastic wrap and allow to set for at least 4 hours if not over night.
So I've written a lot of books since I retired, and they're all much better than the ones I wrote.
While the excavation revealed a number of structures and foundations associated with buildings at a shallow depth below the ploughing level, the relatively undisturbed context of both jewellery and drinking vessels imply a stronghold, even a ‘palacio’ which was more common in the 6-7-8thC Pictish capital of Forteviot in Strathearn. This is exciting because the Rhynie artefacts were found within the remains of what would have been an elaborate system of defensive enclosures, including two deep ditches and a massive timber palisade — alongside remains of extensive wooden structures and fortified buildings. Early power centres of the Picts are scantily documented. The Pictish Chronicle, whose Latin original is lost, and whose various 12thC copies have been ‘tampered with’ by Scots successors to Pictish wealth and culture, gives much detail of names and historic events, particularly in AD7-8thC. But Scots addenda and manipulation of text and some names has traditionally made historians unwilling to depend on it. The Rhynie revelation provides an exciting opportunity to find out more about how the kingdoms of powerful Pictish warlords were consolidated in the North.

And what better way to celebrate than with a giveaway! With not one but two signed copies up for grabs, and it's open to anyone no matter where in the world you may be!
Well, everything! It is perfect for Spring, it is substantial, it has the perfect balance of heat and sweetness, it makes the perfect picnic lunch, my kids like it, my husband loves it, it tastes even better the next day… I could go on… it’s great for entertaining, it’s delicious, it’s great for vegans, it’s my ‘you so don’t need the meat’ salad, I could go on but let’s get cooking…

- Speak Spanish. Went into the grocery story and asked the lady at the service counter "Donde esta el bano?" She spoke Spanish, so it was not too embarrassing. But after she told me where (in Spanish), she asked me where I was from "Estados Uni.......dos....... doh!" I answered.....I then explained I had spent the last two months in Argentina and was not used to speaking English to people at service counters. And come to think of it, I was not used to service counters! She laughed, thought it was funny, and complimented my accent.

Bran is green dreaming (yes that’s a thing; I took it directly from the books) inside his wolf Summer again. They seem to be going through the books rather quickly; I wonder what this means for the publication schedule for the final two books and for the series. Does this mean we’ll get the books sooner or will Martin’s concentration on the TV series set us back? I’m definitely crossing my fingers it’s the former.

As soon as I got the perfect shot I had to take everything down and get everything ready in the car for our location shots at the AMF Rocklin Lanes.
Her secret is taking a toll, eating at her conscience as she goes about her pastoral duties week after week — two sermons every Sunday, singing hymns, praying for the sick when she doesn’t believe in the God she’s praying to. She has had no one to talk to, at least not in her Christian community, so her iPhone has become her confessor, where she records her private fears and frustrations.
So you are at the crossroads, you can turn left (please.. don’t accuse me of being a rightist here…) and use manual settings, take the long way around and see more of the scenery. Or you can turn right, use auto, reach a mini-roundabout and before you know it, you’re back to where you started. If you have time you can now go the other way….
It didn't happen like that though. As soon as he stopped being madly in love with Cassandra, he became a little more cold, a little more distant, and a lot less interested. And for some reason, that made Cassandra interested in him. A reverse psychology kind of thing perhaps. She became clingy. She acted jealous for the first time. They had a huge fight about him being interviewed on Good Morning America with his costar of Get it Out of Me. "The way you guys were talking. It looked like you were in love." And she claimed, "It's not just me. I heard people talking about it. And they were looking at me. Staring. Wondering if you had dumped me."
The bigger travesty here is that they actually had the children AUDITION for this farce AND TURNED SOME AWAY. For the love of Cain I have to wonder HOW BAD THEY WERE that they failed to be accepted. So as well as singers who could not sing, musicians who could not play, and a cheer that was about as enthusiastic as I was about the arts in school at that point, SOMEONE thought IMPROV and TALENT SHOW were appropriate. Let’s see. My daughter has had to attend several hours of practice for this and my question is firstly WHY??? obviously none of the other acts had bothered … or if they had I hate to think what they were like before …. and HOW TO YOU PRACTICE IMPROV … and IMPROV GUITAR at that!!! Oh wait … it wasn’t IMPROV, but rather a set of practice exercises that you learn before you play any real songs. Yes that is what I want to go and hear.

I may be a HIP sceptic still. There is no doubt, sadly, that the movement has sometimes advanced the wrong people for the wrong reasons; it has promulgated approaches that may be radical, but that are often misleading, mistranslated or misinterpreted into going against the very grain of what it purports to do (see Sir Colin on Geminiani, or just read Leopold Mozart, to see how the words on 18th-century violin playing have been distorted for dubious ends).

My review of the first reading of Still Life can be found here (Feb 2009). I remember liking the book and being impressed with Penny's style of writing and I enjoyed the characters, hoping we would meet them again in future books. And we did get to chum with them in the sequels. Penny unwraps parts of each character and lets us slowly get acquainted with them as we might a new friend. In this reread I was reminded of earlier descriptions of the characters and to see them in light of what I knew about them from later writings. My word, they are such multi-faceted, complex, flawed, and yet lovable people. The following quote illustrates how well Penny brings her characters to life, as well as her understanding of human nature and her gift for expressing it in writing.

On Sunday, The New York Times reported that Apple had evaded billions of dollars in corporate taxes by setting up subsidiaries in low-tax or tax-free states and countries around the world. The company also setup a small office in tax-free Nevada, 200 miles away from Apple’s California headquarters, to collect and invest the company’s profits, allowing it to bypass California’s 8.84 percent tax rate, the report said.
This was the heart of the matter. Abraham and Sarah fully believed in their heart they were past the point of producing a miracle baby.

Yet if you visit any White country, it doesn’t matter which one you choose, you find diversity is celebrated and White minority is demanded and calculated to the exact year in the ones where they got the program started early – USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Western and Central Europe. Eastern Europe is dirt poor and is asked when they will be ready for this immigration, regular as clock work; even Iceland (it only has a few hundred thousand White people lol) is pressured to become “more diverse”, ie less White.

They even take James Madison’s name in vain — Madison, who was opposed even to the idea of a congressional chaplain — to argue that any interference with their desire to mess around with other people’s liberties is, itself, an abridgement of their own liberty. There’s a word for that, boys: theocracy. And we voted with our feet and our rifles on that more than two centuries ago.
Spring Barrel at the new NHV tasting room went well. With the tons of things that had to be done prior to opening, the NHV team was running on fumes. I apologize for not posting anything for a while, but that was the reason. It was ironic that in our attempt to create a wonderful relaxing place for people to enjoy and get away from it all, we were having so little peace ourselves. All that changed when we opened. The sound of laughter and happy people enjoying each other’s company all around the property made it all worthwhile. We would like to thank everybody who came out last weekend!
At its heart, Bmore Urban strives to serve as a blog for those Baltimoreans new and old who “Believe” that Baltimore City is great but could be greater. I believe in a few core principles for turning the City around. Many of these differ from convention but convention hasn’t gotten Baltimore very far; the City is still losing population and still ranks among the most violent cities in the United States. These two things need to change before Baltimore can. There are, however, things the City and its people can be doing to expedite and foster this change.
Training under the Yoshinkan Aikido means repeatedly practicing some 150 basic techniques until you get exactly the correct execution of each movement or technique. Mastering each and every technique will lead Aikidokas to master the remaining 3,000. Unlike other styles, Yoshinkan does not study any weapon forms and only practices with weapons as part of the Aikido’s open hand techniques particularly in the areas of defense movements against weapon bearing opponents. Also, Yoshinkan Aikido does not participate in competitions. The focus of Shioda’s Aikido is self defense.
How many people actually enjoy having their picture taken? Apart from the odd one or two and those who make their living in front of cameras! This would be one of the reasons I stay behind the camera! That said, I absolutely LOVE this image photographed by my five (5) year old granddaughter. I think the camera was set on Aperture mode...I think my granddarling captured something special...my relaxed and playful side.

Last night, I finished chapter two and attempted to begin chapter three, but it wasn’t coming right away. Part of this is due to sleepiness, and the other part is due to reservations I’m having about where I want to take a confrontation between two of the characters. It has to happen, but I’m not sure when or how. I’m hoping that a few hours away from it and some thinking will help get me there. Or maybe, I just need to listen to them better. Then again, maybe I just need extra sleep.
Our unit when I took it over only had 12 Brownies in it, so we had our work cut out to get the numbers up! We had a bring a friend night and put out adverts in our local paper and we got the numbers up. 6 weeks after starting with them I had to take them away on a Pack Holiday which had already been arranged by the previous Brown Owl - even though I had my Licence, I still asked the Division Holiday Advisor to come out and visit to check that we were OK! It gave me the opportunity to get to know the other leaders too!

Larry Crowne isn’t a laugh riot like Hangover or a brain teaser like Inception, neither is it a computer graphics overkill like Transformers. It doesn’t leave you drained like The Dark Knight( We’ll talk about That One some other day), it isn’t even an intense romance like, say, The Notebook. And the best part is that it doesn’t try or pretend to be any of those things. It’s just a pleasure to watch, an hour and a half of honest, happy entertainment. It’s what you should watch when you’ve had a long day in the office and want to shake off the bad mood before you go to bed, or when you have got home from a particularly nice date with your girl and don’t want to let go of that warm feeling. Larry Crowne doesn’t try to be an Oscar winner or even a contender. It’s just a simple, entertaining, feel-good movie that makes you happy. And sometimes, that’s what a movie should be.

Without looking where she was going Alice tore through the forest. Branches whipped across her face, cutting her, and roots and rocks tried to tripped her up, but she did not stop. She did not look back to see what had become of her assailant or rescuer but continued to run, as blood and tears streamed down her face she ran until she collapsed against a tree, broke down and sobbed into her muddy, bloody hands.
For the previous month, Bahrainis have succeeded in getting several hashtags to trend worldwide.

We’ve been adding to our collection of baby goodies throughout the past couple of month’s. The baby’s library is ever-growing thanks to the help of ‘uncle’ Derik and some purchased here and there by Tyler and I.

Some days I am a fool to myself. A desire to try new things can on occasion open your world up to new pleasures and delights. It can also thrust you headlong into the very pit of hell.

Muslims are offended or insulted so much because Islam is an eggshell. It is so utterly fragile, and it hides so many blatant and nasty secrets, that anything critical would destroy it - at least destroy it in the case of people who are intellectually open and honest. After all, Islam has cushioned itself entirely from all or any criticism. That’s what sharia law’s for. That’s why apostates are killed and those who convert, or don’t convert, are persecuted and sometimes killed. That’s why Islam has survived so long and also why it has so many adherents.
Camden loves to smile. I take him to the YMCA with me almost daily and he now waves at the lady at the front desk, and other people often run over to say hello to him. They have no idea his name, but he is a literal celebrity because of his 4-toothed grin. I promise that we don't ask him to smile for pictures. He just does. That's just who he is. He's quite the little social butterfly. (He gets it from his father. ;) ) He will randomly wave and almost anyone, and can even do it on command now, always with such a satisfied little grin.

Ah, the generator. A household must that never crossed my mind to procure before I moved to the Frozen Tundra. When it comes to generators, there is an order of supremacy. First, there are the "haves" and the "have-nots". People without generators are the have-nots, pitiful souls at the mercy of the elements, doomed to move to a hotel or worse, the in laws. Those with the foresight and just plain good old Yankee common sense and Boy Scout-level of preparedness...well, obviously those are the haves. As in having heat, water and flush toilets, a fridge, some lights, a way to charge the cell phone, DVD's for the kiddies who can't read or otherwise haven't the first clue on how to entertain themselves, and maybe even....the Internet".
And of course, in few days, in trots the Natural Force. Which, really, is just them remembering the English definition of “normal” rather than the math definition and then trying to place a word with the “n”. So it gets gently corrected each time. And each time we say “normal force” (for quite a while), we (or at least I) usually follow it immediately with “crunchy force” to try and make that connection stick.

When widespread defaults occurred, Trustees discovered that the laws regarding Mortgage Assignments varied significantly from state to state. Many issues regarding such Assignments were simply unresolved. One of the most significant issues was whether Mortgage Assignments could be back-dated or have retroactive effective dates. This issue arose because Trustees and their lawyers discovered in the foreclosure process that the Assignments could not actually be located, or that certain states did not allow blank Assignments.

She went on questioning him about his early life, and Christopher obliged her gladly, feeling as if he’d known her for a long time.

Trouble is that every time you work for a different company they require a separate one, at £51 fee each time. But I've had to register with 4 different agencies. 3 more job possibilities also require separate ones. That's £357 just to prove I'm not a crim.

In a previous post (http://expatiallymexico.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/magical-weight-loss-or-what/) I already told you about Auri’s diet strategies: eat pure aloe vera in the morning, and you won’t feel hungry for the rest of the day. Or drink a juice out of cactus, parsley, celery, aloe and grapefruit and the pounds will magically disappear. So far, no magic has happened to our housekeeper, but you never know… It might just take some time.

Both Deng and Iguodala are underrated players who excel on the defensive end and contribute in multiple ways offensively. Iguodala has taken a dip in scoring in favor of a more team-oriented style of play for the Sixers but continues to spread the ball around (5.5 assists per game) crash the boards (6.1 rebounds per game) and pick pockets (1.7 steals per game). Deng, on the other hand, now becomes the Bulls most important offensive player with Rose out for the rest of the playoffs. With Rose attracting most of the defense’s attention Deng contributed 17 points on 8-14 shooting last night, but the game will be completely different with Iguodala focusing all of his efforts on Deng.

There is nothing wrong with being an Internet experimentalist, fetish or slut as long as you keep your clothes on. Although, I would probably describe myself as an Internet Tease, as I know I have left all my blogger followers with hopes of follow-ups to some of my posts and have never got round to doing it. However, Candy was pushing writing orgies and reckons it is probably better nowadays to be promiscus in a group... or something like that!

What the image on the front of Time magazine is not is a normal depiction of breastfeeding. When a child breastfeeds, especially a child aged 3 or 4 or 5, they are usually going into or coming out of sleep. Which means that rather standing at full height on a chair they are lying down, either on a bed beside their mother or in their (seated) mother's arms.

When should you not double-space your text? When the editor tells you there's no need to. Yes, that's right. If an editor tells you there's no need to double-space, then you don't have to do it. But don't do this until you have permission from the editor. (Let's be honest, if an editor says he wants your manuscript on pink paper, in Comic Sans font, at size 8, then that's what you bloody well give him!) But until you are told otherwise, you give an editor double-spaced text.

The main cause of the Great Trek was the British colonial masters trying to colonize the Boers of the Cape frontiers. There were other smaller factors, but it can be said in summation that it was the Boers' desire to be free and independent of colonial rule which caused the Great Trek.

OK, it’s a little more complicated that than that. Joe, a private detective and narrator of the tale, is hired (by the inevitable attractive woman) to find the author of the ‘Vigilante’ novels. He sets off on a quest to find the implausibly named Mike Longshott, and the closer he gets, the more he realises that something strange is going on.

Sleep, that is what Sicilians want, and they will always hate anyone who tries to wake them... our sensuality is a hankering for oblivion, our shooting and knifing a hankering for death...The novel is ultimately despairing, I found: the truce, indeed loving friendship, between Angelica and Concetta is founded on a pragmatic repression of the past, but that past is briefly revived and Concetta must face the fact that she has lived with a personal legacy of emptiness echoing the wider political impotence that the novel portrays.

Is it not reasonable to suggest a dawdler lane? Perhaps even an unspoken agreement that the sauntering strollers among us stick to the right hand side of the path, and let the rest of us by at a respectable pace? This way they will be far less annoying; we might become friends, we may even wave at them as we pass. If there are any renegade slaloming dawdlers however, then I can only suggest that they are rounded up and carted off to a countryside exile where they can take up as much room as they want and wander off dawdling to their hearts content.

At one point, Jack was "pitching" and Ben was "batting". Ben apparently hit Jack's pretend pitch deep into right field. Jack was NOT happy. He seriously could not believe that Ben hit his perfect pitch so far. Then, he really became irate when he realized that nobody was playing right field and Ben was surely going to score a homerun. I'm sure that in his head, he was mathematically calculating how this was going to damage his ERA in the pretend baseball league.

Well, it finally happened. Two months flew by in a whirlwind of clay activity. This is the last sunrise I saw on Saturday morning from my bedroom window in the Craft House at Penland School of Crafts. On Sunday I woke up at 2:30 am and was in the car by 3:30 headed for the Asheville airport. I left with many mixed emotions. There was sadness to be leaving such a beautiful place where I had many wonderful experiences and met tons of great people. But there was also relief. Being away from home for two months is quite an experience and I was feeling ready to get back. Of course now that I am home, I miss Penland!

A few weeks ago, my roommates and I threw a themed party to celebrate the beginning of “Summer”. The theme was a combination of “trash and class” and, in this context, was interesting because it both flies in the face of fashion while also testing the ways in which we try to look good by looking bad. I know exactly how I would have approached this theme a year ago but the inclusion of Fetish in my life along with the different styles of people I have been fortunate enough to get to know in that time frame have supremely affected my way of thinking. That night, I found myself debating trashy clothing; should I go with a more ultimate form of trash, or add in some class? I made myself a pair of jorts, and threw on a nice dress shirt, tucked in, with my Simpsons tie added in for good measure. I ended up changing later upon the realization that I owned a custom-made (and super-uber small) graffiti shirt that showcased a 1960 Chevy station wagon my father used to race. There were a couple reasons for that change, but the point is that I actively debated the ways that I could look good while looking bad.

We should preserve the elements that keep us informed (i.e. data and years of collective experience), while embracing innovative practices that require us to do what feels wrong…One thing is certain: defying convention always results in
Autumn by David Moody - I was in a very fatalistic mood and what better to read in such a state than a novel where most of the world dies in the first few pages and some rise as zombies a few days later? Overall, the novel seemed like an overblown short story, but there are some good aspects as well with the way characters respond to the world. Shell shocked would be putting it lightly. Recommended with reservations.

Now, I still wake up early (I guess mostly out of habit), but I take my weekends much more seriously. I.e., I try to do as little work as possible, and take advantage of the 48 hours I don’t have to sit at a desk, answer the phone, and contend with the outside world. I read, I bike, I go out in search of new restaurants…And most of the time, I bake.

The 3 Series stands out. Annoyingly for those who want the bmw service center california of the bmw service center california. BMW isn't predicting a massive 540Nm of torque that you'll get from the bmw service center california, the bmw service center california and 152g/km while the twin-turbo range topper which gets 306bhp and a good road and a well-integrated folding hard-top roof isn't the bmw service center california. The power delivery is billiard table smooth and the bmw service center california a 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel. The difference is that both are quick, though the bmw service center california is going to take the bmw service center california to its manufacturer's considerable strengths.

Over time I grew to despise cupcakes. My mission in starting DDC was to offer things you could not get just anywhere. I need not point out that every town has a cupcake shop and every city has many multiples of them. I have been trying to phase out cupcakes for the longest time now because of this plus the fact that they are such a pain in the ass, at least the ones I make. I guess I could just make simple toppers that are cute and decorative but you know I'd never take the easy road.......nope, If there's a way to make something complicated and time consuming I'll find it. Despite finding the production quite tedious, I will (just this one time) admit that it's cool to see lots of little things in groupings. I do love miniature stuff =)

I had exactly one hour to drop Glen off at work, drive home, and fill his prescription. I knew I was cutting it close so I was driving as fast as possible. Both the doctors and nurses told us numerous times to stay on top of the pain killers and never let him go without or longer then the time span for the first day. I finally got to Walgreens and had 10 minutes before I was supposed to give him his first dose. I pull up in the drive through and the pharmacist told me it would take 40 minutes. I about died. I told them I had a 6 month old baby that just got out of surgery and I was in a really big rush. The guy just pushed me aside and told me to wait the 40 minutes.

When you’ve been reading a lot, you can tell what an author is thinking. It doesn’t matter who the author is; whether it’s Brian Jacques, whose books you’ve been reading since age 7, or a new author you’d never heard of, you can tell what he or she will do next. There are things that you can recognize as big writer no-nos, which if violated will mangle the author’s reputation for good writing. Things like describing a scene vividly, then leaving it empty with nothing substantial pertaining to the plot. If the story had a break between plot points that spanned three months, is the author going to describe each and every day in detail? No, just the one at the end of the break. Thus you can see when something big is coming.
He tells a bit of the backstory about this album only in passing, when introducing the "unreleased album" at the end of the boxset. In short, when "Samba de Verão" became a huge international hit and ended up being recorded in the USA by the likes of Connie Francis (!) and Johnny Mathis, record company executives were clammering at his door to bring him to the US and record. In a confusing rapid sequence of events which were only partly clarified for me by Marcos` notes in another disc in this set, but which in truth only left me confused until the contributions of one of my blog friends here, pawylshyn, set me straight, this album was NOT recorded in the US in spite of what I consider a very "American sound." A production credit by West Coast lyricist Ray Gilbert (who, aside from writing English lyrics for songs penned by Brazilian composers, is probably most famous for the tune "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah") further threw me off in my having thought this album was recorded in Los Angeles or someplace. Nope, it was recorded in Lapa, RJ, but with Gilberto and Aloysio de Oliveira (founder of Elenco Records) and NOT Milton Miranda Once more, a whole bunch of great players here -- it's as if every album adds more incredible musicians who want to work with Marcos, this time bringing in new folks on horns like the inimitable Paulo Moura as well as Zé Bodega. Geraldo Vaspar and Roberto Menescal on electric guitar? This almost seems like a typographical error... Anyway, in spite of the huge cast of great musicians here, and the presence of Deodato again as arranger, the album has a very, well, "American" sound. Too many strings for my taste. Not enough horns, not enough jazz, and most definitely not enough of MARCOS VALLE. Still, there's some gems here -- its the first appearance of 'Os grilos' in this box, a song that appears on `Samba 68` with lyrics. It's an infectiously good tune and would be recorded a few more times by Marcos himself. The version of "Samba de verão" is not too shabby, and "Batucada surgui" actually kind of smokes with jazz swing. Others are sadly watered down, musak-like versions of otherwise great songs. "É preciso aprender a ser só" being one of those. You can pick the others yourself. On the other hand this may be prime material for the crowd who likes 'kitsch' and cheesy lounge music to sit around and practice being ironic.

And I thank you for taking the time out of your busy day
West Elm had sent me $25 design dollars I had to use by April 15. I sent Chris with the card since he was going to be near a store. I told him just to get us some pretty bowls. Well then that day they emailed me a 15% off my purchase, including sale prices, because they wanted me back so badly. And every time they come back to me I just can't say no. So of course I emailed Chris and told him not to use the dollars, and immediately got online to choose something. I decided on the Hand Blocked Mosaic Quilt which was a more dramatic choice for me. I tend to go for plain bedding. I liked the inky blue and thought it would work well with my gold leafed nightstands. Anyhow, it arrived this past week and I put it on the bed and loved it. But I was afraid Chris would hate it! So I didn't tell him it arrived and just waited for him to see it. And when he got home from work and went upstairs to give Sawyer his shower, he saw it. He came downstairs and specifically told me "I really love that new bedspread. I really love it". I had to ask him if he was messing with me, but he wasn't. So win-win. We both love it! Want to see it in action? I want to find some throw pillows, and the room is not done at all... but at least I have a good jumping point now. And whatever I do will still go with my plain white duvet when we put that back on in the Fall! The room still has yet to be painted, there will be a headboard soon, and the curtains and hardware will change... so don't judge.

Klein will be with the best Ponysitter in the world, a close barn friend. She is already neighbors with Ponysitter's two geldings and turns out with them, has traveled with them, etc... I Ponysit when she needs it and vice versa. All Klein will do is eat and hang out with her friends. She's already showing a response to her new workload. She rarely will throw a hissy fit but the other morning out of nowhere she threw a big one when her two gelding neighbors went out to the turnout. She knows the deal, she sees them go out every morning and knows that about 20 mins later I get there and I put her out. My friend said she was bucking and squealing and just throwing an absolute fit. Then she stopped and turned her but to the fence between her and one of the gelding's runs, looked right at my friend and pee'd into the next run. What a brat. She got a little sassy with Nina last week when she got her feet done. She also ripped her freedom feeder off the wall the other night and I found it half buried at the end of her neighbor's run. I was not impressed.

We continued through the village and Robert showed us the oil baths - the outdoor bathing area where villagers go to wash, made up of several concrete baths which are filled via small channels running from the hot geothermal pools and derive their name from the oily texture and mineral deposits within the water that is used to fill them. The mineral rich water in Rotorua is said to have healing properties, and can be used to treat arthritis and eczema amongst other things - it's certainly very believable; Mr T suffers with eczema and found that it improved dramatically after a couple of dips in the Rotorua water.

This Friday marks the final opening of Foundation Gallery. Yes, another gallery in Chicago is moving on. Not to oblivion, as in some cases, just the city on a fault line, Los Angeles. Art or Idiocy? spoke with one of the directors of Foundation via email leading up to this announcement and she stated that, “Chicago just cannot support the gallery and our personal goals. Its time to move on, sadly.” Foundation Gallery has provided a unique vision of art to the Chicago scene that will be missed. Foundation’s exhibitions have featured art and design collectives and work that merges the sometimes disparate fields of commercial work, and work for it’s own sake.

This supports the transquote by showing us this is indeed a shadow of Jesus’ actual death and Resurrection, meaning that all the details don’t fit perfectly into place. — Abraham was correct in saying, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering,” God provided a ram to take Isaac’s place in this passage: there was no lamb. The lamb was to come later; Jesus is that lamb.
So as you know, I belong to Swap-bot.com which I love because of all the different card swaps they do there. I have one that is a card swap with a twist...so my partner actually sends me the embellishments to put on the card, I make it and send it back. So I was sent some ribbon, a flower,a button and a brad. Not a lot to work with, but luckily they all matched. So this is the card that I created inspired by the supplies I was sent. Someone had sent me this stamped image in a swap so it seemed like a good one to use up. I cut it out using my Spellbinders and inked the edges with Broken China Distress Ink (BTW have you seen the new distress colors for spring IN LOVE!!!!). I can't wait to get mine.

It's been a busy two weeks, but we're nearly finished with our ryegrass harvest for this year. Our yields have been comparable to last year, and we should have enough harvested to make it our milking herd's primary forage from June until possibly as late as early October. Up to this point we have cut and chopped just over 75 acres with 12-15 more to go. Depending on the weather, we may pass on chopping a few of those acres in favor of rolling a few bales of dry ryegrass hay.
Digging waaaay into the recipe box last Sunday, I decided to make Chinese dumplings. D. and I used to make them all the time B.C. (Before Children) when we had free time. Feeling ambitious, I chose two different kinds of dumplings and two different kinds of sauce. We ate a little late because I got started a little late, but these aren’t hard to do – just time-consuming. This is a great Sunday afternoon recipe when you can devote the time, and the kids could actually help. Miss E ate the crab pot stickers the next night for dinner and loved them (I was very pleasantly surprised!!). The sauces can be prepared in advance and refrigerated until you serve the dumplings.

Zora and Me was the other book I picked up at my end-of-the-alphabet spree at the library.

I watch him at close quarters- he bites his lips ever so lightly,nervous and excited at the thought of it.An amalgam of a smile and a restrained sneer zig-zags down his face in confused arcs.He draws a deep breath,smelling the aroma of roses and earth.And temptation.This helps him out with his predicament.He allows himself another,more convinced smile,puts his i-pod on shuffle,adjusts his headset and the collar of his oddly sweaty shirt before his eyes start gleaming with someone i know for a tricky consort of mine.I relax in the familiarity.

Among the softcover novels worth reading is Samantha Bruce-Benjamin’s The Art of Devotion ($15.00, Gallery Books), a haunting debut novel filled with secrets, love, betrayal, obsession, and deceit. It is a window into one family’s dark and complex history as told from the view of four women and tells the story of the emotional damage within a family led by a matriarch who was tragically widowed too soon, the almost inappropriately close relationship between her son and daughter, and the deceit of an outsider. Its plot is too intricate to describe, but that makes for a story that is hard to put down once begun. The More I Owe You by Michael Sledge ($15.95, Counterpoint) will please those familiar with the poet Elizabeth Bishop. In 1951 she boarded a ship bound for South America to visit friends in Rio de Janeiro for two weeks and stayed for seventeen years. In a mesmerizing debut novel, Sledge creates an intimate portrait of Bishop, her life in Brazil and her relationship with her lover, the aristocratic Lota de Macedeo Soares. Drawing on her lifelong correspondences and biography, he imagines the poet’s intensely private life, lived in conflict with herself as a writer and a woman. There is much to admire and enjoy in this novel that closely mirrors the reality of the poet’s life.
Now, a really good comedy I can watch again and again without hesitation. The one we simply won’t erase – as of late – is Get Him to the Greek with Russel Brand and Jonah Hill. There’s just something about watching Jonah Hill lose his mind and yet still try to keep things in control that is pitch perfect funny. I also feel until you’ve seen a grown man almost raped by a drunk girl with a giant dildo – well – you just haven’t lived.

Following the Talibanised Islamic bridle in and around the abuts of the nation, it is but an anticipated, general dogma. While the situation is supposed to be of similar contour in all Islamic states, the reality is quite the contrary. This disparate is directly consequential of lack of development, urbanisation, infrastructure, education and proper economics. Whereas other Islamic states have cunningly utilised foreign aids and the western nexus to block build a shape of self-sufficiency, Afghanistan has been and still is a continuous victim to spiralling, flourishing feudalism, provincial supremacy and an undemocratic doctrine.

We started the day off walking through the Parco della Montagnola. The entrance to this park is a gorgeous fountain in a wall with stairs on either side of it, and when you got to the top and crossed the small street you were in a beautiful green park, studded with intricate statues of lions and mermaids. (The Mermaids were my favorite, and were very impressive.) This park led to another group of stairs, that you walked down and you were really close to the medieval center. We turned down two streets and we were on the main road leading in to Piazza Nettuna.

I sit here looking out my window. From the 11 floor skyscraper in Toronto Canada. I look down on the streets, on this arctic air morning in April. I have my cans on. It’s first thing in the morning, as the sun comes up over the towers. The silver spot of the day. No one has arrived to work yet, so I have the whole department to myself. No telephones. No whinny sales staff. Just me, the black bird flying high, and my headphones cranking Birth of Joy

Sometimes after great passion, sometimes after profound simpático the great heights of the heart are scaled, promised potentials glimpsed, or sometimes the disappointment comes in the morning to strangle the heart among the cold sheets.

(the children I mean, although technically you shouldn't whine either). 2) Teaching them character and obedience was always more important to me than school itself. If you don't get all of the schoolwork done (WHEN you don't get it all done) don't sweat it. 3) Give yourself a break and don't let outside pressure push you to do things that aren't necessary to your family at this point in your life. Whatever you and your husband decide is necessary is all you need. Just because your over-achieving sister-in-law is teaching Latin to her children doesn't mean you have to. If all you do for a while is math and a study on spiders....that's perfectly
Day 4 was another small challenge because Diana and I were taking day 1 of 2 for ATCN- Advanced Trauma Care for Nurses. Which was catered by the hospital. With fajitas. Also queso. Thankfully we had each other to sit by with our quinoa salad and hummas but man did the queso look good. Another round of stir fried veggies tonight…super quick to make too, I’ll definitely be keeping this particular recipe around. It was a good one. Bought the food for week two and a TON of fruit. Lots of fruits and veggies- I even branched out and got some beets and asparagus so we’ll see if I like them. My fridge is WAY full. Plus the freezer because I had just bought about a weeks worth of meat and pasta for dinners before I decided to do the reset…Whoops!Q
Sendak was a lovable curmudgeon who did not suffer fools very well. Though he said in a 1993 interview with NPR that “Children surviving childhood is my obsessive theme and my life’s concern,” he claimed he didn’t write children’s books. He just wrote. I know he was right, because his audience includes adults still trying to survive their own childhoods, who find empowerment in his stories and images.

David was wealthy, healthy, handsome, talented, smart, strong, loved, respected, and trusted – all in II Samuel Chapter 9 – but only two chapters later, we see David fall into his greatest sin – the incident of his affair with Bathsheba and subsequent murderous cover-up. Was David so blessed by God that he became filled with pride and fell into sin? Or was there something else going on behind the scenes? Stay tuned for Part Two, in which we will delve deeper into what it means to be a good steward of our blessings.
Years ago as a gift to my mother I had framed some needlework that her mother and grandmother had stitched. These are precious momentos from generations past and to protect the work I had the framer cover the needlework with glass. No one walks up to the needlework pictures and exclaims about the glass in the frame, they are focusing on the picture underneath. To me, that's the idea behind this verse and Kris' challenge . . . we are to become more and more transparent ourselves so that the Word of God and the love of God is what people see. If we accept Jesus as our Lord in an intellectual sense I don't think it ever is deep enough to achieve this transparency, it has to be the movement of our hearts. When we truly have it in our hearts then it becomes what we live and breathe every day, it becomes our daily walk, and that's when the transparency can begin, when people in the world around you can see Christ in and through you.
Coraline Jones is bored. It's the summer holidays and she is now trapped indoors by the unseasonal damp and rain. Her parents are both too preoccupied to see to her entertainment. Her father suggests she explore their new home. Once a grand house, the Jones' have half of the second floor. There is even a door that goes into the other half of the house. A door that is very firmly bricked up until it's not. When Coraline goes through this door she finds a mirror world of garish colors and eccentric people made odder by this "otherness." Everyone in the house has an "other." Everyone but Coraline. Her Other Mother has been waiting for her to come. Her eyes made of buttons hungrily awaiting the arrival of her daughter. She is solicitous, and loving, and would never desert Coraline for work. Coraline quickly realizes that this is not a place she wishes to stay. Yet her Other Mother has plans for Coraline's permanent residence in her world. If Coraline won't stay, she'll make her stay.
The Beach fluctuates between extremes. It can epitomize California surfing and beach-going perfection, with waves that are worthy of surfing magazine covers and glorious, sunny days that bring the crowds out to sunbathe en masse. It can also be home to some of the most unfriendly and punishing waves on the planet, and when shrouded in wind and fog it is one of the most aggressively uninviting places imaginable. Its bi-polarity is a big part of what makes it so intriguing, and representative of our city as a whole. We’re renowned for being a progressive hub of social harmony, and regularly live up to that reputation. However we are also home to a despicable and well-documented sex trade, and our neighborhoods on a micro-level are noticeably homogenous, just to name a few of our many black eyes in the city. The human creation that is San Francisco mirrors the complexity and energy of the natural creation that is our Western border, Ocean Beach.

So as I move into my second year of blogging, my vision of what I am doing has changed. Overall, I am happy with what I’ve done so far. I’m tickled that the most hits I’ve gotten so far came via the search term ”slutty dress.” I’m proud that a ninth-grade reader shared “Teen Girls and Tight Corsets” on her Facebook page. And most of all, I’m delighted with the people I’ve met out here.

I hate to sound like a killjoy but I’m basically a traditionalist. While a little Shakespeare is better than no Shakespeare at all, it’s rather a disconcerting experience to ponder King Lear‘s startling lines of ingratitude and misplaced love drowned out amid a tidal current of flurried people, bawling children and barking dogs. That kind of theatre turns the like of King Lear and Shakespeare into just another day in New York City. In fact, that’s the very reason you’ll probably find me in attendance at the next Shakespeare on the Run performance, regardless of whoever happens to be running it, if only because I live here.

There’s no such thing as registering too soon, however you should edit and delete items as the seasons change and items are discontinued or no longer available. Remember that your wedding is probably 12 months away and the stock in stores will change so you should revise your registry a few weeks before your bridal shower and around the time you mail out your wedding invitations to ensure there are enough items for guests to choose from.
But Victoria went her own way often enough that a film could be made of her younger years. The only negative is that the film lacks passion. Despite that, kudos to Director Jean-Marc Vallee as well as screenwriter Julian Fellowes for his fine script. Four point zero, and recommended for anyone that enjoys historical dramas and fine period furniture and costumes. Plus Emily Blunt is quite nice to watch for nearly all of the 105 minutes.
In my time away from you, I’ve done a lot of thinking, a lot of working and a lot of living. I’ve rearranged my living room at least three times and it’s even now going under its latest transformation. I’ve moved couches, rescued an ottoman from the Goodwill for a meager $10 (I brought them down from $15) and offered new homes for things that no longer worked in my humble abode – things that no longer fit my existence. It’s been liberating and a little scary as I stumble to discover my new sense of self. My living room reflects that as I wonder what exactly my new sense of style and self entails. And, like myself, my home for the past eight years still feels unfinished despite the work that’s already taken place.

In the second section we are presented with a glimpse into the life of Vasily Kiprianovich, a professor of cinema studies, who has been invited by a famous Writer—Solzhenitsyn capitalises the word—to advise him “on types of screenplays and techniques used in writing them.” They meet in the Writer’s dacha, a Russian country cottage used especially in the summer, hidden from view by a tall wooden fence. While showing the professor round his home he has no problem boasting “about a remarkable new appliance—an electric refrigerator he had bought from Paris.” Of course we realise at the end who it is that Fedya has written to and there is no likelihood of a response. I had never really considered Solzhenitsyn a satirist—despite being influenced by Chekhov—but that’s what we have here, plain and simple.

We spent Thanksgiving in Pennsylvania with Jonah’s family. We flew, and on both trips we had layovers– so that is four flights that we took with Skip in a week’s time. He did amazing. We are fortunate to have such a good traveler for the time being. I think he’s helpless to the vibrations of transportation. He always falls asleep in the car, and an airplane is no different. It’s like as soon as we are taxi-ing to the runway his eyes get heavy and by the time we are cruising in the air, he’s passed out. He loves it. All four of the flights we took were around an hour each, so they weren’t too long, but holding a content baby in my arms really helped in calming my flying anxieties.

Mitt Romney is an old hand at campaigning by now, and it shows. His answers to questions are clear and obviously well thought out.

There comes a time when you must apply the Word where it hurts. For God is not unjust. He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other believers, as you still do. Hebrews 6:10 (NLT) You must not quit! Don’t even consider giving up. God’s promises are true; I know I’ve seen the works of His hands. God specializes in providing hope to the hopeless. He is fully able to do that which seems impossible. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. James 1:4 (KJV) You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. Hebrews 10:36 (NLT) “I know all the things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance. I know you don’t tolerate evil people.” Revelation 2:2 (NLT) “I know all the things you do. I have seen your love, your faith, your service, and your patient endurance. And I can see your constant improvement in all these things… Revelation 2:19 (NLT)

After World War II, the government endlessly warned about the dangers of Communism and taught to fear the military strength of the USSR. The US engaged in military conflicts (Korea, Vietnam, etc.) to “keep the world safe for democracy”. The Communists also hated us for our freedoms, apparently. With the fall of the Soviet Union, our government lost a valuable tool for justifying unconstitutional activity and defense spending – until September 11, 2001. I have no doubt there were many in our government who found a silver lining that day – a new enemy to replace the one that did itself in.
Sometimes, I drive to the ocean which is just a few minutes from my job. I park, overlooking one of the most beautiful and famous areas of the California Coast.

I know all the tricks. Never bad talk your old employer. Instead, say ‘no room for growth’, makes you sound ambitious. Make your greatest weakness somehow a strength. “I care too much, I don’t delegate enough, I’m a perfectionist”. Don’t ask about salary, even though you probably really need to know that. Instead, ask about the companies five year plan, even though, let’s be honest, you don’t really care.

These champagne cupcakes make a great treat for an adult party - be it an elegant party or a bachelorette party. You'll want to use a sweet champagne rather than dry, pink champagne would work too.

Top champagne cupcakes with a chocolate covered strawberry for a fancy dessert. You could also make them mini cupcakes for a cocktail party.

Some lessons in life that are harder to learn than others. Taking a step back and seeing the truth about yourself and your choices is not an easy thing to do. It's hard to admit that there are things you are responsible for that continue to affect your relationships. It's hard to admit that we create some circumstances in our lives that we may not like. It's hard to let go of control and just accept that...
On a podcast I was listening to, a full-time Shamanic practitioner in America stated her anger at those who approach her expecting training, but offer nothing in return. Not money, not food, not even a bit of help around the house. But they want a full shamanic apprenticeship. What are they expecting? Why are they asking?
Mostly, though, there was laughter, and scoffing.

Babyloss is a UK-based resource of information and support for bereaved parents and their families who have lost a baby at any stage of pregnancy, at birth, or due to neonatal death. The organisation was established in 2000, and is run by a small team of volunteer administrators and forum moderators.

September 23: Great Britain and Spain sign a treaty prohibiting the slave trade: Spain agrees to end the slave trade north of the equator immediately, and south of the equator in 1820. British naval vessels are given right to search suspected slavers. Still, loopholes in the treaty undercut its goals. Slave trade flows strongly, 1815-1830. Slave economies of Cuba and Brazil expand rapidly.
So the Tea Party Mascot is “palling around with Black Nobility, Bloodline Sun-Worshipping Satanists”…the entire McGinniss Fence/Belmont Race Track Boob Flashing saga is just another Annual Bilderberg Conference distraction, and it’s highly possible she blew into town to participate in the Black Nobility June Satanic Rites & Rituals! Last summer it was “death panels” and the faux Letterman feud. Next stop for the Global Management Team…the Annual Summer PEDO-fest at Bohemian Grove in California …wonder will ole Henry K sneak any of the MK’d Palin women onto the 2,700 forest campsite for the usual antics of w/ their BETA Sex Kitten alters prog’md for ANYTHING, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE w/ANYONE FUN?

These two dishes were so playful and delish! On the left we have a fun take on clams and spaghetti (the clams are stuffed with spaghetti squash). And on the right we have a faux-sagna where the pasta sheets were made with turnips and rutabega, and covered in tomato sauce, cheese and truffles.

Carol Denbow: So many authors write a book and never manage to get it published. Big publishing houses only seem to want to publish books by previously well-known writers. A lot of great manuscripts get passed over in the process. Not to mention, the frustrating “no thank you” responses to our submissions. How long did it take you after writing the book to find the right publishing option and what was that journey like?

Since my house will consist of domes, I decided that I would construct my gingerbread model in the same way you make a clay coil pot, which would be similar to using earthbag tubing. I looked around online to see if anyone else has made a gingerbread house this way, and while I didn't find any, I did find a few gingerdomes that were constructed in other ways, such as this geodesic one: http://www.flickr.com/photos/35535885@N03/4153861565/. (The image is password protected, so I couldn't copy it in.) I also found a really cool site that features "green" gingerbread houses.

Divorce offered salvation to “the battered wife or abandoned husband, for the wife whose children starved because her “breadwinner” husband owed his wages to the tavern keeper or the card shark, and for the husband whose wife flaunted lovers and neglected the children.”
Last week, we had two friends visiting from Scotland. Whenever we have visitors, I tend to want to take them to lots of restaurants, because that seems like the best way to show them our city, but when jet lag is involved, it feels mean to force anyone to sit upright or speak in complete sentences after approximately mid-afternoon. So on Sunday night, after a morning visit to the farmer’s market and a long walk down to Golden Gardens, past a cluster of plastic flamingos and a creepy guy digging for sand worms and back up the hill again, we decided to stay home. Our friends shelled peas and opened a bottle of wine, and I washed arugula, put on a pot of water for pasta, and got some sauce going.

6. At some point, you will want to give up on breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is hard. Even though it is natural and every woman is capable of doing it, it takes a few weeks to get the hang of it. DON’T GIVE UP!! It is the best thing on this earth that you can give your baby. See a lactation consultant as many times as it takes to get the hang of it. And don’t believe that crap that “some women weren’t made for breastfeeding” or “my boobs are too small/big” or “the baby just likes the bottle better”. lies, lies, lies. You can do it. And if you don’t want to breastfeed because you think it is awkward, hard, inconvenient, or because you don’t want your breasts to sag….then you’re selfish. I’m sorry, I’ll get off of my soap box now.

The thing is that once you get into the cooks lifestyle: the heat, the stress, the camaraderie, and the eventual reward at the end of it all...it becomes hard to let go of. It starts to become less about a reward for yourselves at the end of the night and more about your nightly plans. Everyone's sharpness becomes just a little more dull...but you tell yourself that its ok. The team is stronger now...closer. Isn't it?

Gee, I feel like I've not been doing much but show and tell of my shopping pursuits lately. While that may be true, I do want to show you what I found last weekend. The photo above shows the sugar dish of the sugar and creamer I found. It is so pretty and would you believe I found it at a yard sale? For $1 for both pieces? I didn't need it, but how could I refuse? I rarely find anything like that for that kind of price. I fell in love with those roses~ YUM!

Our garden this year was the biggest we've had and it did fairly well. Next year we'd like the garden to provide for more of our needs and to do that we really need to improve the soil quality. We know the chickens will help with that - we're putting their bedding on the garden this fall and letting them scratch in it over winter.
We assume that the hardest, most difficult path will always be the most fruitful in the end and that the more we bring suffering on ourselves, the more generously we will be rewarded. But if we listen to the great saints and teachers of the world, we are struck by one common theme: They all speak of how gentle it can be. Jesus says “Come to me, all you who are heavy laden, and I will give you rest…My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” Thomas Merton says that in the moment we stop working for ourselves and begin to work fo the divine, we will be amazed how easily it goes.”
Paruresis has physical causes, but ultimately root of paruresis is mental. On top of the fact that paruresis is a mental problem, it is exacerbated by negative emotions as well. Paruresis itself tends to be magnified by emotional issues, the very issues that drive some paruretics into such a severe state of the condition, that they often become functional agoraphobics who completely isolate themselves from society and human contact in general. But when a paruretic accepts the condition for what it is: a mental disorder that causes physical issues and is made worse with negative emotion, they can begin to really make progress. It is my firm belief that the most vital step to truly overcoming not just paruresis but secondary paruresis (the emotional impact that paruresis has) is by being able to have a more positive outlook on not just their condition, but life in general.

That mindset is no longer confined to a few ghettoes; it finds open expression in city government, in state government and even in the White House and the Justice Department. The ugly resentment, the selfish greed by those who have never worked for a living, is dressed up with American flags and the looting is described as wealth redistribution, but it's still the same thing. Except now the government functionaries do the looting.

If we, the church, continue our over-dependence on money to advance God’s mission, the majority of God’s talents will remain dormant and the body of Christ will not grow to maturity. Thus we rob Christ of the full demonstration of His grace that He is so anxious to put on display before the universe – the display of sinful people being transformed and moving away from self-absorption to serving others unselfishly.

A skydiving experience would cost me about $100 more than a hot air balloon ride, but it would include photos or a video done by a skilled free falling videographer. On the other hand, the hot air balloon ride itself would last 45 minutes-1 hour versus a minute-long skydive with a professional on your back. Then again, skydiving would be more fun if I were to do it alone [even though the pro would be there behind me] compared to a long hot air balloon ride alone with the professional, unless I had someone special to do it with. Oh, and if you haven’t already read my blog about my deal with roller coasters—particularly the huge drops in the course—then falling at 120 mph would probably scare the hell out of me.

Despite proper notice to respondent requiring him to file his answer to the complaint, respondent continued to ignore the matter. Finally, on 20 February 2002, the case was set for hearing by the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline. The complainant appeared. Respondent did not show up despite his having been duly notified of the hearing by personal service effected on 12 February 2002. Respondent’s failure to appear prompted the Commission on Bar Discipline to grant the request of complainant to allow her to adduce evidence ex-parte. An order was issued setting the proceedings on 18 March 2002 for such reception of evidence. A copy of the order was served on respondent on 28 February 2002 at his given address.

I didn't get to go to Salem last Wednesday like I had planned. I really need to get some backing fabrics and that is the place to go for those. So I thought I would go tomorrow. NOT! Got to work on my day off. That is not a bad thing because I sure could use the hours. So maybe Saturday I will get those backings. We will have to see. I think I will just quit planning to go!

Yes, we finally got some snow! It is crazy to think that we didn't have snow on the ground until January. Vanessa and Owen were super excited to be able to go and play in the snow. Vanessa could stay outside all day long if we let her. The cold doesn't seem to bother her much. But Owen on the other hand, can only stand playing outside for about 30 minutes. He must get that from me.

There are 118 boys per 100 registered girls in China, whereas the biological norm is 104-106 boys and 100 girls. To put it in a nutshell, they destroy one-seventh of Chinese girls. The girls are killed by their own parents. "One family - one child" policy gives an incentive to it as well.

Right now I play most of the blockbuster games and I’m left with a meh feeling. Some good moments but still some really bad. And I feel that if they’re developing these new consoles will they do away with the 360 and PS3 entirely? Sony seems to be heading that direction and returning to the motive of destroying used games. I get that you want the developers to get more money to make more games, I get that. And I support that. What I don’t support is having that used game linked to my account and my account only. That’s a horrible idea! I have to be connected to your online network just to boot up single-player? Bad move Sony and bad move Microsoft. If this is in the final stages of your system I won’t buy. If I want that I’ll just go on Steam and play on my PC. Console games are made for the home and that’s why.

Despite the obvious comparisons ranging from the Running Man to Battle Royale, The Hunger Games is largely original in its execution. What must be congratulated is the films obvious criticism of reality t.v. that is so relevant today, along with a veiled criticism of the gratuitous media coverage of modern war. If anyone believes that this film is too bloodthirsty or horrific then they need only look at their own television tastes and turn away from the public humiliations of individuals on the X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent and that is the point and beauty of The Hunger Games, where does reality T.V. end? 8/10

Some of the things they’re doing to me are really stupid. I no longer put my bath towel on the rack in the bathroom. When I did, I would find finger prints all over the towel. So, instead, I hang my towel on the pole in my closet. Well, what they been doing is placing the towel on a hanger, which I did not do, to make me question myself. I’m damn well aware of where I’ve placed my towel. I put a piece of cardboard on top of my refrigerator and find it on the floor near my window. I put my paper towels in my kitchen cabinet and find it on top of my refrigerator. They take food from my apartment and then return it a day later. I turn my oven off when I leave home and come home and find it on. I turn off my circuit board, to save on electricity, and come home find it turned on. Oh, for a while, I had to replace toilet paper almost every day. I’d put a new roll of toilet paper in the bathroom and come home and find an empty roll. Right away, I knew what they were doing. Trying to make me question my sanity.

Of course, it's not finished, but the facts remain. I'm much like a water faucet these days because the complications surrounding my broken heart are, well, complicated.

As does brushing my teeth. And peeling a mandarin. And getting dressed. Getting undressed is arguably worse, for reasons as inexplicable as why I can't put on mascara with my mouth closed. No, I can't. Don't even try to argue with me right now.
Raise only what you need to get of the ground. Optimize for people not for valuation, if you have a great idea it will do well and it will most likely get a great valuation anyway. Seek out the people you want to work with, don’t just hire people on their resumes. Raising VC, is like hiring people to be on your team, find people who believe in what you are doing. Do not assume you need a lot of money to get going, Instagram raised only $60k to launch their first version. Focus on the prototype and gaining traction do not waste time on a fancy pitch deck. Bringing a prototype into a meeting speaks louder than graphs predicting future earnings. Prototypes are tangible and something that people can understand and talk about.

When I pulled the dough from the freezer is when we realised our mistake. One slice of the cookie dough would only yield half (maybe) a pinata burro. What to do?!

Once upon a time, not even that long ago, I actually wished I could go back to the way things were. However, with life experience comes wisdom and the passage of time has brought me the realization that I don't want to go back to the way things were. I've learned so much and value the experiences I've had far too much to want to go back to "the way it was," that nostalgic tugging I often feel isn't a desire to go back and replay life's greatest hits, it's that longing to "re-feel" my firsts.

And yes, I got many, many, many weird looks while shopping. Usually people selling candy buy the full bars and people assume they're at a stand or filling vending machines. But bags and bags and bags of miniatures really had them guessing. I had to make another trip to pick up sugar free items and more chocolates as we sold probably close to 1500 of those. So, with making flyers, candy shopping excursions, printing candygram cards, the TShirt sale, assisting with planning the educational lectures and helping with some other prep work, I was lucky to be home to let the dogs out to pee on a regular basis, poor pups.
As was to be expected from the results of both previous studies, there was a significant negative relationship between the Moralism and Attitude to Apartheid scales (r = -.200) when the sample was analysed as a whole.

There is a bakery in a city of Bandung, Indonesia called Bawean or Sweetheart. This bakery is so famous and I've been hearing lots of things about this particular bakery. I for one, never been there and when I heard so many good things about it, especially about what they call "Mocha Nougat Cake", I just had to try making it at home. From what I heard, this is one of their most popular cakes, it has three layers of vanilla sponge, filled with very strong rum custard, covered in mocha buttercream and crushed nougatine. When I say strong custard, I really meant STRONG. I never prove it of course, but I have quite a few friends coming from the city and the first thing they say when describing this cake is that this cake is strong strong strong in alcohol. I mean literally, it's so strong that it's bitter and the alcohol goes straight into your nose on your first bite. Many said that they feel tipsy after a slice or two, but strangely, people kept coming back and makes you wanting for more.

It feels like the beginning stage of 'Oh fuck I'm about to get diarrhea' mixed with horrible menstrual cramps.
Here is the link to the news page that I run. RecoveryNowTV News You can find all my personal writing under the "Voices in Recovery" tab at the top. But, I also curate all the news, so all the news articles are my work, too...but I cannot take credit for writing the articles themselves, I simply curate them for our website. It is a great resource for addiction and recovery news. I know some of you out there would really enjoy having this addiction and recovery news all in one spot. (I am thinking of VJ on this, in particular!) I post about six news stories a day, so it really keeps me up to date as to what is going on in the news in regards to addiction and recovery. I curate a few recovery pieces, a few news pieces that generally center more around addiction, as well as some informative pieces, often based in research and statistics. Each day, I try my hardest to put up a mix of the three. Along with a personal blog piece, several times a week. I would love it if some of you checked it out. If you like RecoveryNowTV on Facebook, you will get each news article and blog piece in your Facebook feed. All the comments are done through Facebook, rather than on the website, so Facebook has a lot of good interaction with others, lots of comments and debate, at times. It really is a great job. I love it. And I know this is what I am meant to be doing right now.
And that is why I've never been a fan of bars.
During these times we often find it difficult to cover some of the subject areas, such as Science and SOSE in a more formal way.
This clasp is so easy to hold in one hand with the curve open slightly and slip it into the ending link, then press closed, I rarely use anything else for bracelets now. If you are in a pinch the swirl can be opened with pliers and a closed wire-wrap can be wound into the middle, the swirl can then be pressed closed.
This year, was a sold out event and attended by some 800 guests. All primarly in the medical profession. More than one hundred artists donate a piece of art, which is carefully juried. The inaugural event, some years ago, showcased " Featured Artist" Sophie Matisse, the great grand daughter of French painter Henri Matisse.

I weighed myself like five times yesterday, each time with the same result–130 pounds. Then I weighed myself with my clothes off and I weighed 129. I’m not sure which one is more accurate. The one with my clothes on for weigh-ins with my therapist, but with my clothes off when I’m at home.
We need to take better care of our children to provide better suited entertainment and education that helps them grow in a positive way that will give them (and us) a better society in the very near future. If we end up with a society in 60 years time that is cruel, uncomfortable, impersonable and violent, we’ll only have ourselves to blame.

KJARTAN: It affects everybody in a way.
This will probably come as a surprise to most people but I actually really love John Mayer, as a musician. As the lothario of Hollywood, dating and ditching some of my very favorite celebrity women, (Jennifer Aniston, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jessica Simpson, the list goes on,) I am not so much a fan of. Still, as a musician, he is absolutely brilliant. I am also really in love with this song – it has actually become a bit of an anthem for me since I first heard it a few weeks ago. It is very much in the typical John Mayer style and, while I have complained about 2 artists earlier in this post not changing up their style, John Mayer’s style is what it is always going to be because he is one of the best at it. Plus, where I have always felt that John Mayer’s real progression shows is in his lyrics, and that is definitely the case with this song. The lyrics to this song are absolutely beautiful, just discussing a moment when you stop and realize that things are going to turn around for you and, as the lyrics say, your “shadow days are over.” Like I said, this song has become a bit of an anthem for me lately and I highly recommend checking it out!
Overall, I'd have to say this is a good resource if you have questions, but as I would recommend with any book written about the Bible, always be sure to double check references and make your own inferences from the Bible directly.

The article by Hecht et al. indicates that the authors are comfortable with TSNA levels in Marlboro and Camel snus, and that they view these products as acceptable cigarette substitutes. Perhaps Drs. Hecht, Stepanov and Hatsukami will now endorse them in this manner.

The myth frequently used by politicians to justify the further dismantling of the barriers to political patronage is that both Civil Service and Tenure make the firing of a bad employee impossible. “It is employment for life” – they say. That is an absolute lie. The two systems provide due process. Discipline must be for just cause. And employment must be granted through a system of exams and vetting; not by “connections.”

For the conference, I was asked to give a workshop on plotting. When I sat down to figure out what I did, I discovered a surprising fact. I’ve written nine books—eight erotic romances for Ellora’s Cave and Kensington Publishing, and one sensual historical for Dell (The Club—my February 2009 market debut). But I had not plotted any two books the same way.
My Spring Fling IPA will be on tap by Saturday night. I can't wait to give it a try. Sometime next week, I'll keg & carbonate the Belgian-style Saison. The "pre-tastings" of this brew (when I checked the specific gravity) really got me (and my son) excited.
Stan and Mae struggled together in vaudeville and films for ten years. George Burns spoke highly of their two-act in later years. He recalled that Stan played Mae’s mother, cried a lot, and got pushed around a lot by Mae, who was a sort of matronly Margaret Dumont type.

It doesn’t look like the public is quite up to speed on this issue, which obviously has something to do with the fact that we Canadians have access to a hell of a lot of fresh water so we don’t even realize how fortunate we are. Just what are Canadians’ views about fresh water? Interestingly, Royal Bank has been polling Canadians about this since 2008 as part of their Blue Water Project. Their 2012 Canadian Water Attitudes Study found that 40% of poll respondents believe that fresh water is Canada’s most valuable resource. A shocking 21% said oil is our most valuable natural resource.

Professor Nutt also said that “parents should be aware that the drug that is by far the most likely to harm their children is alcohol”. Across the whole of society, that may be true, but no drug can harm you unless you actually use it. Obviously parents don’t want their teenage offspring either drunk on Diamond White or stoned on skunk, but on an individual basis I’m sure the vast majority would prefer them to have a glass or two of wine or beer rather than a daily joint.

I also followed the veins on some coloured paper leaves with PVA glue, and repeated the process with the foils. The writing on this Scrapbook page "Hidden Among the Flowers" achieved in exactly the same way. I used a fine nozzle attached to my PVA glue nozzle to write the words free-hand with the glue. The finishing touches were made by adding flowers punched out of brown cardstock and purple foiled sticky backed paper for constrast.

I bet when I shoulda folded, folded when I shoulda bet. Even when I was the dealer - which came really, really early in the evening - I flipped over cards, misdealt, and generally irritated the regular poker players (see Wikipedia entry under "Crack Whores").
Last night, I took some serious action to work towards this goal. Me and a few cohorts met up to have an International Beer Night of sorts. We each contributed beers from various countries and held our own miniature tasting party, taking a hoppy, yeasty virtual trip around the world. Germany, Scotland, New Zealand and Japan were just a few of the countries whose products we enjoyed, and we definitely enjoyed the majority of what we tried.

Last year they were convinced autism was caused by vaccinations and now that’s been dismissed. Meanwhile, there’s a whole lot of kids running around who are going to get things like whooping-cough because their mothers are afraid to vaccinate them. I suspect that’s why a lot of people are homeschooling their kids.
"Nightmare" is the first word that comes to mind.
I make no apologies for the life I lead and how I portray myself. Just like I'm not ashamed of one very hard working and ambitious man I call my husband. I married a rather frugal and funny man who grew up as one of 7 children. He doesn't like to spend money on himself and I have to throw out his boxers and t-shirts on the sly and just this weekend keira asked him why he had a hole in his jeans. I rolled my eyes and was prepared for the answer - because I spend all my money on you kids. Of course he laughed afterwards. He does have good jeans, btw. But that's him. He regularly tells me that I'm doing such a good job with the kids or how gorgeous they look and so on. He is incredibly proud of our little family.
Still with all of the snafus, setbacks and cussing, we had just enough time to sample and get our LA-31 into the kegs before the Gulf Brew.
I haven’t even touched on the design magazines, book covers, posters or the music and film clips in the Exhibition – Vanessa Redgrave in Blow Up in 1966 - or the fact that David Mellor could design cutlery that’s sublime to hold and at the same time design the traffic light still in use today. Or that the Concorde, that awe-inspiring example of British design, made its debut in 1969 and or that the street sign for children crossing still used today was first designed by Margaret Calvert in 1964.

1. The MRC PACE Trial used the Oxford criteria which do not define patients with ME/CFS. If used correctly, they exclude people with neurological disorders yet ME is a classified neurological disorder (WHO ICD-10 G93.3). The Trial’s “operationalised Oxford research diagnostic criteria for CFS” (Trial Protocol version 5, 2006, Section 7.2) were partly financed by the Chief Principal Investigator’s (Professor Peter White) own money (JRSM 1991:84:118-121). Professor White’s American peers have pointed out that the UK estimates (that are based on the Oxford criteria) are likely to include a high percentage of patients with psychiatric morbidity (“It is at least possible that the 2.54% to 2.6% rates in both the United States and Great Britain are due to a broadening of the case definition and possible inclusion of cases with primary psychiatric conditions. Some CFS investigators would not see this as a confounding problem because they believe that high rates of psychiatric comorbidity indicate that CFS is mainly a psychiatric disorder….Most importantly, the erroneous inclusion of people with primary psychiatric conditions in CFS samples will have detrimental consequences for both the interpretation of both epidemiological and treatment efficacy findings” (Professor Leonard Jason: Problems with the New CDC CFS Prevalence Estimates: IACFS/ME: 2007; Professor Leonard Jason: How Science can stigmatise: the case of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. JCFS 2007:14:85-103). A Canadian psychiatrist who specialises in ME/CFS, Dr Ellie Stein, said on 25th May 2007 at the ME Research UK International Research Conference held at the Edinburgh Conference Centre, Heriot Watt University, that the Oxford criteria “could describe almost anybody. I do not believe that studies which use the Oxford criteria can be generalised to patients which most of us in this room would consider to have ME/CFS”. Indeed, on 14th July 2006 Professor White sought Ethics Committee approval to advertise his PACE Trial to GPs, asking them to refer anyone “whose main complaint is fatigue (or a synonym)”. The MRC PACE Trial entry criteria had an “open door” policy and did not identify people with ME/CFS (those supposedly under study in the PACE Trial), hence the reported results cannot be claimed to refer to ME/CFS patients.
Even though we are believers, we have let our fallen state lead us into the dominion of the world system. It is through the allure of this world, and the deception of the enemy that we have been wounded and taken captive by the enemy to hinder us from living out the destiny the Lord has for each of us. And, because we have not been taught how to appropriate the deliverance from bondage – the spiritual freedom that is our legacy, we continue to be bound by these anchors of our past - our sins our failures, our suffering through abuse and betrayals.

Today we didn't really do much to celebrate we just got on with the business of living, but this year we were able to do that without the deep seated fear that we were in the final days of the freedom that we have taken for granted over the past 10 years.

Anyway, I drew the map with coloured ink on heavy rag paper, and then baked it until it became quite fragile so that the players (just like their characters) had to be quite careful about how they handled it.
In case I’ve ever left any room for doubt, I am hopeless at times like this; utterly helpless in the presence of these sweet and chocolaty foods. Even though I would steal only a piece of cookie here and a slice of brownie there, that’s all I ate for eight hours: cookies, brownies, Nutella and cake… I had such belly bloat from all the refined sugar by noon that I should have been frightened, very, very frightened, but instead I kept going back for more. And it was all topped off with a giant bowl of pasta for dinner, which was delicious—Mel and I had dinner at Caffè dei Cioppi—but it was not exactly the smartest choice at the end of that gluttonous eating day. My belly bloat was beyond a polite woah-ho slow down, girl! look. It was disgusting, to say nothing of how carved out and empty I felt.

Have you ever wondered why manicures done at a salon lasts longer than doing it at home? They don't actually have top secret information. It just takes a few simple tricks. Tricks that spell the difference between a long lasting manicure and one that is not up to par. I am going to share with you some tips to get a salon-worthy finish.
Unfortunately I didn’t get the chance. At 9.30 in the morning someone handed over £20 for the collection and took the whole cake !! However, they did phone back the next day to say it was delicious and could they have the recipe, please !! So I will just have to make another one some day.

Mr. KELLAWAY asked the Prime Minister if his attention has been called to the verdicts in the series of libel actions arising out of the last General Election; and whether, with a view to increasing public confidence in the administration of the law in such matters, the Government proposes to introduce legislation?
I once met the son of a Liberian government minister and asked if he had seen video-footage of his former president Samuel Doe being tortured to death. ‘Of course’, he replied with a smile. ‘Everyone has’. They cut off the ears of Doe and force-fed them to him. His successor, the warlord Charles Taylor, was elected in a landslide result using the campaign slogan He killed my ma, he killed my pa, but I will vote for him. Nice people. Liberia was founded and colonised by black Americans to demonstrate what slave stock could achieve. They certainly showed us. Forgive my heretical belief that had a black instead of a white tribe earlier come to dominate South Africa, its opponents would not have been banished to Robben island. They would have been butchered and buried there.

Another favorite attraction of ours was Talking with Crush (the turtle from Nemo). This "show" was amazing! The animated Crush on screen talked to and interacted with the audience perfectly in sync with his animation. He would take questions from and ask questions to people in the audience and said things like "You so totally rock dude!" Kyla (with Nate's help) asked Crush if he painted his fingernails like she does. When she said she was 2 he said, "Oh, you just hatched! Awesome." He was perfectly in character and sounded just like Crush on the movie. I have no idea how they did this but we all loved it. He was very funny and witty so it catered to adults just as much as the kids.

By now it’s 1am and we were just arriving at the resort. We pulled into the parking lot and saw no parking spots available. I drove around a while, did a little off roading (not realizing some of it was on a golf course and on a part of the TM course) and eventually came back to the main parking lot. There was actually a lot of activity for it being 1 in the morning so by our luck somebody pulled out and drove off and I took their spot.

Neil’s thirst for knowledge and his quest to be the best he could be was an increasing struggle as his body slowly deteriorated. He is a quadriplegic with full body involvement, which means his head and neck are affected. He has limited use of his left hand and the extension of his arm. He has full use of his right hand and right arm. The muscles in his legs are too weak to support his body weight. If he tries to stand his entire body shakes and he falls to the ground and is unable to get up on his own. He has problems with visual scanning of both eyes, which makes it difficult to read a paragraph of words.
Wasque is part of The Trustees of Reservations, a Massachusetts land trust organization that sounds arcane, but is actually exceptionally relevant. This conservation and preservation group is hard at work acquiring and maintaining more than 100 irreplaceable and amazingly varied treasures that are sprinkled all throughout the beautiful state of Massachusetts. Their reservations cover more than 25,000 acres and range from strawberry fields to verdant pastures to lush woodlands. (For my full song of praise on the Trustees, see post on 7/26.) And of course, there’s Wasque.
If you remember, I couldn't tell you exactly when/how I learned to crochet, which complicates things for this question, too... What I consider my first finished crochet object was the Luna Lovegood scarf, which only took me a few days to crochet-- but I have no idea how long I began working on it after I first started learning to crochet. It was a while, I imagine. (I was a very slow starter in crochet.)

This week, our specials and intervention time was cancelled. That makes for a LONG day!! I survived, I'm still in one piece, and was still up by 8:00 a.m. this morning---so I must have not been completely exhausted!!! I'm so thankful I have a GREAT class!! They were so well behaved, worked hard and stayed quiet (there are two classes on the other side of my wall that were testing). I think they enjoyed their week too!!

First, look inside your own life. Are you walking in the integrity you expect from others? It’s easy to chuckle at a child’s inability to know that Mickey Mouse isn’t real, but what about the destructive belief systems we’ve lived with so long they’ve taken on a life of their own?
But what about the authors--most of whom, apparently, pony up for the highest-price packages? Do they get their money's worth? Apparently, the readings/signings have proven popular, and in the fist week of March, 75 consignment books were sold. However, without knowing how many authors are involved in the program, and which of the books were tied to readings/signings, it's hard to assess that figure.
When a publisher showed interest in one of our project ideas, we gathered the stories and put Mishaps together (about 5 months). That particular publisher opted to not take it, as their budget had changed by the time the book was complete.

The Feast of Unleavened Bread occurs concurrently with Passover after the night to be much observed (Passover eve), and lasts for seven days. The Feast of Unleavened Bread is meant as a reminder to us of the Israelites’ redemption from bondage in Mitzaryim (Egypt) and also of our own redemption from sin through Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). These Feast like I said were institued by Yahweh. They were not started by the Jewish people.
The app store will still find future app updates and everything should be working as it should. I’ve found no issues by performing these steps but as usual I take no responsibility if things don’t go to plan for your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. I’m pretty confident you’ll have no issues though.
Jesus has borne the death penalty on our behalf. Behold the wonder! There He hangs upon the cross! This is the greatest sight you will ever see. Son of God and Son of Man, there He hangs, bearing pains unutterable, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God. Oh, the glory of that sight! The innocent punished! The Holy One condemned! The Ever-blessed made a curse! The infinitely glorious put to a shameful death! The more I look at the sufferings of the Son of God, the more sure I am that they must meet my case. Why did He suffer, if not to turn aside the penalty from us? If, then, He turned it aside by His death, it is turned aside, and those who believe in Him need not fear it. It must be so, that since expiation is made, God is able to forgive without shaking the basis of His throne, or in the least degree blotting the statute book. Conscience gets a full answer to her tremendous question. The wrath of God against iniquity, whatever that may be, must be beyond all conception terrible. Well did Moses say, “Who knoweth the power of thine anger?” Yet when we hear the Lord of glory cry, “Why hast thou forsaken me?” and see Him yielding up the ghost, we feel that the justice of God has received abundant vindication by obedience so perfect and death so terrible, rendered by so divine a person. If God himself bows before His own law, what more can be done? There is more in the atonement by way of merit, than there is in all human sin by way of demerit.

I don't use a hoop. I tried using one for my first quilt, but I just found it a pain to keep moving it around. So now I just rest the quilt on my lap (or sometimes tuck my feet up on the couch and drape the fabric over my knees) and grip the fabric with my left hand. I'm careful not to push up too much from underneath, but just try to hold it neutrally. I grip the fabric between my thumb and palm, and spread my fingers under the quilt, with my middle finger under the place I'm sewing.

I work for an 18 month old construction company, a partnership between Max and Manuel, 2 brothers whose single mother raised them and who have worked together always. Max’s wife is our office manager. On a good day, Max’s nickname is Gordo; on a bad day, it’s Cabezon which means “pig-head”. Manuel’s nickname is Borrego, Spanish for sheep, since he has a habit of looking straight ahead when he walks or works, not left or right, in direct locomotion to his destination. Max and Manuel have never known anything but hard work; their kids’ graduations from college were family firsts.

The same outcome also happened in the case of two Singaporean JC students caught on video kissing publicly in school – they were expelled immediately without a chance to appeal.
It seems obvious to describe this as a kind of mobile version of the Sea Organ in Zadar, Croatia—or the San Francisco Wave Organ—with the addition of fine woodworking skills and some quasi-scientific instrumentation. Putting this into the context of a project like "Amphibious Architecture," featured here a few years ago, it's easy to imagine an acoustic early-warning system for pollution, floods, and even the appearance of rare marine wildlife. A city's waterfront—a whole bay—ornamented by singing buoys.

5) Sensitivity – All these guys nowadays talking about women so objectively via all sorts of media- from musicians through to every day school kids, again made me think that a guy who genuinely cares without an ulterior motive was actually non existent. Ladies (or men) there are men out there who are sensitive without being so emotional that they need a permanent box of Kleenex by their eyes so the tears continue to be soaked up by the ultra strong tissues.
My husband and I started attending services at a very large church. The pastor's word spoke to our hearts. His interpretation of the Bible compared to today's lifestyles captured us.

This card features the menu for my Hostess Appreciation Tea....It won't be held until June, but I thought it would be cute to show at the beginning of stamp club as a teaser of sorts. I purchased the teapot card template from Stampin Up! demonstrator Ilina Crouse, and I think it makes an adorable faux Old Country Roses when used with the Baby Blossoms stamp set. I wish I'd pre-ordered the crown charms in the mini catalog--One would have been ~perfect~ hanging on the ribbon as a tea tag in the spot I used a vintage brad!

Well, all of this babbling is just a roundabout way to 1) make it seem like I am writing more than I actually am, and 2) introduce a new little series of films for me to review (or probably not review if my track record holds true) starring (or at least featuring) a particularly massive-maned man I once knew as Malibu.

My Lord gives me peace and as such I am able to see the others out there who are somewhat like me and I am compelled to pray for them and not just myself. We are all women just trying to live as normal a life as possible given our own special circumstances.
When people like Rennie are convicted of vile crimes but then have their minimum prison sentence cut, it puts the legal system in this country to shame. The do-gooders in society will point to Rennie's 'human rights'. This dismisses the human rights of those children who are the victims of his actions.
Listen to the sound waves within you.

I went through Baird, Texas, primarily because the tiny town was the county seat, and, therefore, has a county courthouse. The 1929, Classical Revival building wasn't all that unique, but the sky was a deep blue, and the clouds were white and billowy. So I think the pictures came out really well, despite the plainness of the courthouse.
On a really sad note, Today we are saying Goodbye to CHERYL, a really gorgeous lady who has been with Bizzy Becs Store Blog Challenges from the very beginning.
Start as Yoshi, afresh go about with the babyish aboveboard crates (like in the alpha of Bleared Bewilderment Cave), lick it up, afresh swallow, you egg should be a aboveboard egg now, allocution about easter egg.
But anyways, this mani is from a while back when the movie The Hunger Games first came out. This was what I used :)
If you have ever attended a slimming club with the resolve to lose weight, be it Weight Watchers or Slimming World, you will be laughing out loud at Fat Chance Guide To Dieting. While the diet group in the novel is purely fictional, and a little extreme, with all the worst parts of slimming clubs thrown in, anyone who has ever been on a diet will be able to relate in some way. While there are some extremely funny moments within the novel, especially during boot camp, I really enjoyed the way in which Claudia Pattison also dealt with the distress that being overweight can cause to women. Holly, Naomi and Kate, are clearly unhappy in their lives, even though they may put up an affront to the outside world, and I enjoyed reading the events that led them to their weight gain, as is usually the case with women piling on the pounds.
Needless to say, once I realized my mistake and made two more batches using only 1 stick of butter each, they came out great, super tasty and smelled soooo good.
In a food processor, coarsely chop the almonds, cranberries and pineapple. In a large bowl, mix in the chopped nuts and fruit with the seeds and oats. Fold in the almond butter mixture. Press the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
The hills were hands down the worst part of the course, horrible on the knees and calves and relentless. We went downhill to Funky Monkey bars where a recent dip in the mud made it nearly impossible for me to grip the grease soaked bars. I made it about half way and fell into the muddy water. We had one team member push all the way, he screamed on every bar to put him through the obstacle mentally, it was epic.
“When did I poop last?”
There is some bloodshed though – this isn’t strictly comedy – but considering how sexual the situation is there is almost no sexuality, which again illustrates the cultural differences between the Americans and the Chinese. This gives the movie a curiously sexless feel, and the sex did add a certain amount of kick to the original like adding jalapenos to a salsa.
Actually- she rarely walks. She's usually running. Full board, non-stop.
He squeezed his eyes shut again, and sensation ceased. At least if he couldn’t feel anything, he couldn’t feel the chaos around him. Even the feeling of sinking below the murky waters of sanity faded and he became nothingness. Stable.

I told Leo that there was still the gravestone marker in the Cemetery to add credence to the story, and I quickly was met with another laugh from Leo. The Spring of 2009 had seen torrential rains in the canyon and at one point, a large mud and rock slide had struck a small area of the town cemetery. A number of headstones were destroyed. All the headstones were eventually replaced with new markers, except for one.
The same, of course, applies to a cover letter or application form. And the classic mistake if you are addressing it to a named individual is to get their name wrong.
At that point Mr. Big was still in my tummy and Little R just hadn't fine tuned his devilish ways yet... So, here we are 2 years later and it's ruined.
So i open this beer up and before I even pour it I get all kinds of sour cherries, brett, and soda esters. The beer pours well with high carbo and a deep mahogony, but it comes out with more of that nose. Oh that's disgusting. I think this one is infected. I just did a search on beeradvocate and a few of the folks on there may have had the same issue I have. I smuggle this thing all the way from St. Louis and it must be infected or something. Just terrible. I'm trying to chug down at least one glass, but I think we have a problem Houston. Let's try something else and let this thing be for cooking.
Jay: What nerds.
But who’s fault is this?
