For Elyse, these things don’t make her special. They make life dangerous. After the death of her parents, she’s been careful to keep her secret as closely guarded as possible. Now, only one other person in the world knows about her age and ability.
Our individual and very powerful choices have huge consequences for ourselves and our loved ones’ futures. Trading in that big, huge monster truck for a more efficient model is like trading in the wood stove for a fan on a hot day. Turning off the lights and reducing the temperature in the room is like turning off that hose in the flood. Doing these things means we can contribute to a much larger, natural bank account for our children in the future when the going gets tough. What loving parent wouldn’t want to save into that kind of trust?
The first time I walked into McSorley's Old Ale House and asked for a bottle of Bud was years ago and I was informed that they only sold their own ale. As a matter of fact, McSorley's has only sold it's own ale since it opened it's doors in 1854. As another matter of fact, the one big change that did take place required a decision from the Supreme Court, that being the admittance women. The feminist landmark decision forced the bar to finally install a female rest room by 1986, but other than that little has changed. Nothing has been removed from the walls since 1910, and souveniers from visitors past include handcuffs from Harry Houdini, a chair that Abraham Lincoln sat in when he visited in 1859, and wish bones left by soldiers during World War I. Those wishbones that remain are of soldiers who never returned to take them back.
So, here’s my question: is it wrong that I do most of my outlining in my head?

I need to make a few points regarding the political landscape facing us in 2012. But first, a proviso: it is a new year and we just finished its first week. By this I mean that much can, and much will change. But these are a few things that I have gathered from the past several months and believe apply at this point in the game, from my view on the sidelines:

It suggested that management might have been better off using the RM766mil to expand its plantation land or motor segment in China.
If you have ever researched composting you have likely seen the rule that says you should not put seeds in your compost bin. I was always so proud of myself for composting in the first place that I never took that rule too seriously. As it turns out, there is a reason for the rule. If seeds get mixed into that lovely, fertile compost, guess what happens? Well, sometimes they grow into a massive vine.

Tamotsu Fukada, the father of Fuka-Eri, was alternating his story as "Tamotsu", the idealistic leader of an agricultural commune, and as "Leader", the godlike leader of the Sakigake cult. The background of Tamotsu's/Leader's story were already prefigured in the first books. Professor Ebisuno, one time best friend of Tamotsu and eventually the adopted father of Fuka-Eri, had already recounted parts of the story to Tengo, while Leader himself talked about it to Aomame before she killed him. Aomame's research into the archives of library already provided the general arc of the key incident in Book 4. Also, the novella Air Chrysalis, as read by Aomame and described throughout the first books, already gave away some of the plot elements. Hence, it would appear at first that this was another repetition of the story. Surprisingly though, there were new elements to mine in this story, and there were several inconsistencies, slight modifications, between the versions of events and reality mentioned in the first three books and the events and reality of the present book.
I know they’re really bad for me, given my genes and health history. I know I feel better when I cut them out of my diet. I know I should follow all of these rules and tricks for sugar addicts. Of course I know all this, I’m a smart girl.

This is relevant too your interests because you’re a douche.
If you have more than platonic intentions for our relationship, you need to use the word date. Or some imperative implying a power role, like “I’d like to take you out.” No hanging out, grabbing food, meeting for a drink. That’s how my friends ask me to hang out. I honestly won’t see the difference and it’ll be super awkward at the end of the night when I realize what’s really happening.
I commit to myself to only start considering the practical aspects of participation in this world where I let go of my preoccupation in my mind with unnecessary thoughts based on fears and desires
Not only was Spofforth the first great fast bowler ever, he was also cricket’s first true fast bowler- one with deadly accuracy, overpowering aggression and good pace. His terrorising effect on the opposition batsmen earned him his larger than life nickname- ‘Demon’. It was his crippling 7/44 that gave England their first ever Test defeat and gave birth to the legend of Ashes. He was the first man to take a hat trick in Tests and his 14/90 at the Oval remains the second best performance by an Australian till date. Had business concerns not forced him to retire at the age of 34, Spofforth would surely have taken his already legendary career to even greater heights.
I am in year 5 of my 5-year project to build a gentleman’s wardrobe. When I began the project I confess that I did not set out with this as a clear aim. Like many men my wardrobe was not near the top of my priority list; family, career, finances were at the top, and rightly so. A little over 4 years ago I got round to looking at my wardrobe I realised that something needed to be done. I certainly didn’t have the money simply to replace my wardrobe so it needed to be done bit by bit. With hindsight I now know that this is the best way to build a gentleman’s wardrobe. A 5 year project was begun.
Yes, yes I will do that because I love you, but you know what? It has also taught me something that I don't think I would have allowed myself to learn on my own because (blush) I would have been too busy working.
Medicaid law is very clear; a state may not restrict patients’ choice of providers of services like mammograms and other cancer screenings, if those providers are qualified to deliver care covered by Medicaid.
That’s it. I’m done. 11 years later and it’s over. I can’t believe it. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for so long and couldn’t seem to fit the time. God blessed me with a layoff … and time. Blessings in disguise, I’m a believer of that. All the work, the all-nighters, the headaches, the fights, the financial stresses, the advising headaches, it’s all over. I walked out of my last class.
Hellfire! If Facebook Friends count for anything, I could never review a comedy gig and would get arrested as an accessory after the fact in many a dubious minor crime.
Universities? Well, if you're from the EU the fees seem to be subsidised by the government, but you still have to live, and good luck with that in Sweden. In Norway, which is richer than Sweden, the government offers student loans rather than grants to cover fees and living costs. With interest of course. Sociology grads, beware.

So there you have it - we like the idea of drinking in the pub but fewer of us are actually doing so! Mintel have a theory - it's down to the recession and cheap drink in supermarkets. Nothing to do with this then:

*According to pre-Hellenic myth, the Age of Gemini (approx 6000 BC) was considered the ‘Golden Age’, Saturnia regna when Saturn/Kronos ruled. Following the Precession of the Equinoxes, each celestial Age lasts around 2200 years. More detail on successive ages here. In Mongolian myth the Age of Gemini signaled a time when ‘heaven and earth separated’ and fire was born. In other words, before the ecliptic and celestial equator fell apart (and the equinoxes started to precess), there was no fire. It was ‘given by heaven’ in the Golden Age of the Twins. 8000 years on, we entered the Age of Aquarius on February 14, 2009.
The house was awesome! Right on the beach with fantastic views of the sound. There were 3 1/2 bedrooms in the main house along with nice living room, sun room, dining room and big kitchen.

Rental costumes are a pretty good idea too. We have this place near us that does authentic movie type costumes which is neat, and rental is about 35-55 dollars depending on the costume. (Great deal for the looks available) This is also where I’m going to get some of my wardrobe for photoshoots and such. For all of my coastal Georgia readers, check out Acme Costumes in Garden City, GA. The backroom is the authentic rentals and the front is all the normal costumes. They have year round business unlike most seasonal costume places.

Overall, the idea behind the novel was good, but Dawes takes a very long time getting to the meat of the story. Some readers may really like this slower pacing, but I am in-between. Too fast and little development leaves me yearning for more, but too slow and too much development leaves me a tad bored. This novel lends itself to those looking for a good vampire story that slowly develops its characters over the years within the novel. Two and a half stars.
In its absence take a look at this interesting picture and make something up for yourself. I'm going to give it a try while me and my horse are out doing our thing - if the story comes together well I might post it here sometime soon.

The move for this old sailor who served in the ‘forgotten fleet’ in the Pacific has been quite emotional; he has left behind a lot of memories. The place was brand new when they moved in all those years ago, my wife was a young girl still at school, his late wife was a young woman and he has seen lots of comings and goings over the years with neighbours moving in and sometime later moving out, some to a higher plane.
All in all an enjoyable evening. David’s suggestion that we then meet up in the pub, ‘The End’ (actually a wine bar that looked like a pizza restaurant, eeeugh), we took literally and went into a really nice Young’s real ale pub at the end of the block. Business cards were exchanged, ideas to fix the worlds current problems were formulated, and chunky chips were devoured (thanks Inga).
There's lots more going on, but I'm out of photos, and want to get back outside.

Peer learning relationships are based on the concept of mutual and reciprocal helping between two or more people of a comparable status and who share a common or closely related learning or development objective from learning how to deal with relationship problems to finding out how to drive traffic to your website. Unlike traditional mentoring, peer-to-peer learning and support is characterised by its non-hierarchical status thereby saving learning and development costs.
A more common use of the “r” word is in respect of those who object to the fact that the most significant changes ever to have occurred in this country were imposed upon us over the last forty years without even a pretence of democracy, a choice or the opportunity to vote on it. It is used also against those who do not unquestioningly welcome uncontrolled levels of immigration, or accept as gospel that the newcomers bring nothing but benefits to our ancient homelands.
I have not lost confidence in our president or in our military, whose boldness, courage, vision and decisiveness are admirable. I have lost confidence in the Iraqis themselves, and I certainly have no confidence in our media or in our national will. To the extent that the November 7 election is a referendum between staying the course and cutting and running, we will soon find out what our national will is. I am afraid that Americans are short-term thinkers, and that we will choose to minimize our short-term casualties, thereby maximizing our long-term problem with radical Islam. Sometimes pain is the only path men are willing to take in the acquisition of wisdom.
The referendum in May 2010 was later passed by local voters (Tower Hamlets administered the referendum and many people suspect it was rigged) and in October (on a turn out of just 10%) the controversial Lutfur Rahman was elected as Executive Mayor for the next 5 years.

After gathering this information, I decided to research the prevalence of Adderall usage here at Hofstra. I asked students what they thought about Adderall and whether or not they used it. Out of the six I asked, five admitted to taking it, and of those five, only two actually had a prescription. This shows that Adderall is not only commonly used, but commonly used illicitly as well.

The car at the front of the queue might have looked disconcertingly empty but it was headed up by a shrivelled homunculus consisting of a ropey cardigan and a flat cap and a sackful of crappy driving habits. I know. I was there. A plume of smoke and the irritable shucking of the fag ash out the window was all that proved that someone was putatively alive behind the wheel. Normal life form was undetectable in terms of things like motion.
And, speaking of opening, a bad job of doing that can ruin the whole thing. Just keep a few things in mind:
Don’t look at it and cast judgment; don’t let me know how bad any of the parties I mention within has acted. Each person on this earth makes decisions they think are best. If they did not think they were best they would not have acted as they did and therefore, who are we to say anyone should have acted any different. What is done is done, nothing can be done to go back and change the things that have transpired, we can only move forward hoping to have taken something from what we have learned and apply it to our own lives to
Forgiveness is an act of will, not a feeling. Forgiveness is choosing not to seek revenge. Some would say that forgiveness is not fair; it’s letting those who have wronged us off the hook. Some would say of those who have hurt them that hanging is too good for them.
“Bagels!”
I am not a bit hungry. Maybe that is why no recipe has challenged me tonight. Guess I will tell you about one that I tried for Easter! You are on your own with it. One of my daughters told me it looked like raw meat balls. After I told them what was in it several were brave enough to try it and said with a surprised look on their faces, “Mmmm. Not bad.” Will that be enough of a testimony for you to try it? I tried it because I had saved the recipe for a long, long time and had a half box of Vanilla Wafers in my cupboard that I wanted to get rid of. I would eat the whole batch myself if I dared risk the sugar.
Perhaps they should spell out that Queen of Teen is there to promote contemporary books with girls as main characters, well-written books which often handle difficult subjects with a light or humourous touch. That QoT recognises a bias against girls' fiction in the world of children's literature, and wants to reassure girls that the authors that they enjoy are more substantial and important than adults sometimes realise or recognise.

The word “credited” is a banking term. It referred to monies that were transferred or credited to your account. What was credited to Abraham because of his faith in the promises? How is our faith to be like Abraham’s? What gets credited to those who believe in the death and resurrection of Jesus?
I use bone in chicken with the skin on because it has a lot more flavor when cooked and makes a good gravy. Season chicken with seasonings and cook through, about 15 minutes on the skin side then turn over for 10 minutes on the back side. If you are using boneless skinless, cut into chunks first and pan fry until all pink is gone. About 5 minutes.

The next 30 minutes my grandma's heart beat on it's own. She had the world's biggest heart, and a heart for her family, and it was evident there on the monitor. As odd as it seems, I stood at the base of her bed, and held her foot. I just looked down at her feet and thought of the many pedicures I had given her as a little girl, and thought of the current day, when Taylor loved to color her nails. Sometimes many different shades on top of each other. :)
Usually when you love an author's first book, you don't expect to be blown away by her second book, but with Sarah Pekkanen's Skipping a Beat, that's exactly what I was. Blown away. From the very first page I was swept up into Michael and Julia's story of how they were less than privileged high school sweethearts turned millionaires by his DrinkUp flavored water. Yet, because of her father's gambling habit, Julia requested a pre-nup before she and Michael were married so that she could be responsible for her own money and have a secure life unlike her own mother who lost everything because of her father's gambling habit.
Just like in a job, just like in relationships, just like in life. Never, ever sit down and pen that angry profanity-laden diatribe that tells the other person exactly what you think of them. It never works out well.

So, I decided that I will live with my horrible wire shelving and make the best of the unused space that existed above all the shelves. (Side note :: if I lived near Ikea, it is very affordable to build out a closet using some of their systems and I would consider it. But, I have no plans to hit Atlanta's Ikea any time soon, so whatever, I think I will let go of this dream. My husband will be happy that he doesn't have to build any thing. And that, my friends, is worth a lot.)

That’s the way I’ve been doing it so that’s the way I’ll continue to do it. One semester at a time. I’ll work all day and study all night and one day it will all be worth it. That “one day” apparently is at least a year and a half from now. :-/

Davis was an enthusiastic shooter and gun owner. He participated in fast-draw competition and was said to be capable of drawing and firing a Colt Single Action revolver in less than a quarter of a second. Davis was skilled at fast and fancy gun spinning, and appeared on T.V. variety shows showing off this skill. He appeared in western films and as a guest star on several “Golden Age” T.V. westerns. Davis nearly died in an automobile accident on November 19, 1954 in San Bernardino, California, as he was making a return trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles.[14] The accident occurred at a fork in U.S. Highway 66 at Cajon Blvd and Kendall Drive. Davis lost his left eye as a result, and wore an eye patch for at least six months following the accident.[15][16] He appeared on What’s My Line wearing the patch.[17] Later, he was fitted for a glass eye, which he wore for the rest of his life. While in the hospital, his friend Eddie Cantor told him about the similarities between the Jewish and black cultures. Prompted by this conversation, Davis — who was born to a Catholic mother and Protestant father — began studying the history of Jews and converted to Judaism several years later.[1][18] One passage from his readings, describing the endurance of the Jewish people, intrigued him in particular: “The Jews would not die. Three millennia of prophetic teaching had given them an unwavering spirit of resignation and had created in them a will to live which no disaster could crush”.[19] In many ways, the accident marked a turning point in Davis’s career, taking him from a well-known entertainer to a national celebrity and icon.[14]

Songs. Let me make that clear. Sábanas Blancas by Gerardo Alfonso, Havana's unofficial anthem; To Be Continued by the Azerbi pianist Aziza Mustafa Zadeh, because death doesn't signal end but transformation. And I just love the energy in the piece. Because by The Beatles, a song that has some of the better harmonies the Fab Four ever came up with and whose lyrics are some of the saddest ever written. Águas de Março by Tom Jobim and sung by Elis Regina (the live performance on youtube, though, not the studio version) because it showcases Elis's talents brilliantly. And last but not least, we come full circle back to Cuba.

Few people have enjoyed a closer association with jump racing in the last 30 years than John Patrick ’J P’ McManus, who was born on a farm in Co Limerick on March 10, 1951 and attended the Christian Brothers school on Sexton Street, Limerick. He left his father’s plant hire business at the age of 20 to become a racecourse bookmaker, but then took the less well-trodden route of gamekeeper-turned-poacher when becoming a professional punter. McManus recalls one of his first bets as being on Merryman II in the 1960 Grand National when he was just nine, but the bet that changed his life was £4 on Linden Tree in a Newmarket maiden in 1970, the horse winning at 100/8. He had another £4 on when Linden Tree won the Observer Gold Cup at 25/1, and £5 each-way at 33/1 for the Derby, when the horse beat all bar Mill Reef. The amount he wagered grew rapidly and he is still one of the highest-staking punters on the racecourse. Dubbed “the Sundance Kid” by journalist Hugh McIlvanney after a number of major gambles in the ring during the 1970s, he is also the biggest jump owner in terms of numbers in Britain, Ireland and France (some 300 horses spread over 50 trainers ran for him last season) after he purchased his first racehorse, Cill Dara, at the age of 26. He has a host of business interests including dealing on the financial markets from his Geneva base and part-ownership of the Sandy Lane Hotel in Barbados, where he also has a house. With John Magnier, he bought a 28.7% stake in Manchester United through the Cubic Expression company before subsequently selling out to US tycoon Malcolm Glazer in 2005. He was in the news shortly after that because of his stake in the pub and restaurant operator Mitchells and Butler. In 2011, the Sunday Times estimated McManus’ wealth at £481 million, making him the 12th richest person in Ireland. Since Mister Donovan landed the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle in 1982, he has enjoyed 36 other Cheltenham Festival successes, headed by the great three-time Champion Hurdle hero Istabraq and the brilliant Baracouda, who landed the

Why is it that we wish to hold onto those childhood moments. I suppose it’s because as a child they seemed perfect.

This put a big damper on the event. It took me two hours to calm him down. He was angry. He doesn’t like to be touched by strangers, and in my opinion, he has a right to feeling that way. Yes, ideally, he’d be able to better handle it but right now, I have bigger fish to fry. The fact that I got him to an overnight event is a big deal! I can’t downplay that, or let anything else do it either. And I was angry. All the work I’d done was about to get flushed away, all because someone else was irritated by something small and not necessarily even legit. She got to go hang out with her friends and smiling kids, and I was left with an angry child unable to enjoy the cool stuff all around him, a kid who spent the rest of the night trying to block out the sounds because the overstimulation (both physically and emotionally) had him super-sensitive to sound.

A great deal more could be said about Narcissus–and indeed, about Hyakinthos, Ampelos, Krokus, Hylas, Kyparissos, and any number of others–and yet, we have to reckon with the fact that in the attested literature, Antinous is compared to them but never equated with them, and in fact more often he’s equated to their divine lovers (e.g. Dionysos, Hermes, Herakles, Apollon, Silvanus). This might, in some sense, clear up the difficulty seen in the comparison which Arrian made between Achilleus and Antinous, perhaps in terms of the already-divine and deified lover therefore not being like the slain youths who became flowers in these myths, but instead being like the divinities who loved mortals, of which Hadrian was still one. However, we can’t be sure.
RDS has tons of different options, from traditional to modern and everything in between. Even if you don't have walls to paint, these stencils are beautiful for furniture, fabric, or craft projects (like my little wrapping paper project).
Still, Christmas or not, there was work to be done. The chickens and sheep needed to be fed, the floors needed washing and so did the clothes. I was sweeping out the inside porch when Dad came in, his eyes sparkling. He held a big piece of tin, probably left over from someone’s roof. Dad had been collecting little shiny bits for weeks and was stashing them in his workshop. He never spoke of it, and when anyone asked about it, he just pretended not to hear, but we all knew he was down there working on something big.
Since the marriage between Abhimanyu and Sasirekha takes place while the Pandavas are still in exile in Dvaita Vana, we conclude that she is the senior wife to Uttaraa, the daughter of Viraata Raja, who Abhimanyu married at the end of the Agnyaata Vaasa of the Paandavaas. Still it is Uttaraa’s son Parikshit, the father of Janamejaya, who continues the Pandava race and we kind of never hear of Sasirekha, Sri Krishna’s sweet niece again, in any story…
Also in preparation for boot camp, I’ll be eating three times a day. I’ll need to start waking up early and going to sleep early as well. I’m going to look into a job with UPS. It’s full time, so that would actually help with the sleep schedule, but my thesis might die…

The glass mugs were also used to dispense the fiery mustard served with most food listed on the menu, but particularly with the basic "cheese platter". This specialty has been described in a previous blog so I will not return to prior revelations. The mention of mugs and mustard returns our attention to the above picture.

To collect damages the farmers legal team used an obscure attachment to the 14th amendment which most people are not aware of. After the civil war the government allowed citizens to claim a payment on anyone who suffered damages as a result of the Federal Government failing to protect its citizens from harm or damages by a foreign government. President Grant had this attachment sealed from public eyes but somehow, someone the farmer’s legal team got a hold of it.
Here’s another picture of the garden.
We caught up with Lee just as she was coming back from a trip to St. Lawrence Market .. Wearing a beautiful shearling vest over a cashmere beige turtleneck, she takes off her brown leather riding boots and starts showing us her place…which is very cozy for how small it is. Then, she starts hovering around the kitchen, unloading her grocery basket into the fridge and telling us all about her wine party plans! Lee Anne is clearly an avid party planner and we realize that we should hurry it up because she has a lot of plans for the rest of day, aside from our little photo shoot.
And guess what. This cut doesn't work if you have baby fine, slightly wavy hair. Even a pinch of humidity causes the ends to go from straight and sort of punky to curled up and just plain messy looking. It looks like shit, frankly.

From an anynoymous source we just heard that Kalup Linzy pulled out at the last minute from his show scheduled to open Friday at Monique Meloche. Rob Davis & Michael Langlois, also showing, stepped up and filled the whole space. The website now makes no mention of Linzy and only features info on “Robert Davis + Michael Langlois in collaboration with Rashid Johnson Look into the Rays...”

With a title like this, I think I ought to dispense with the rhetorical amenities and come straight to the point. For those of you who do not know, it may be worth saying that the phrase, “crap-detecting,” originated with Ernest Hemingway who when asked if there were one quality needed, above all others, to be a good writer, replied, “Yes, a built-in, shock-proof, crap detector.”

No-one has ever taken the time to explain to police officers that legal and lawful are two very different animals. Simplified, legal = plastic and lawful = solid gold. Legal pertains to benefits, lawful pertains to rights. Never ever confuse or conflate the two.

A kitchenaid mixer has always been on my list for kitchen wants- but baking has suddenly become much much more important. When I was working for a baking products client we knew that taking up baking was mostly linked to having kids. So true. And more than ever I need to know what is going into my food. Until recently, I would happily buy baked products from a few different places in Sydney - but unfortunately I witnessed a huge delivery of cage eggs to one of these bakeries. The treats just didn't taste the same ever again.
And to be honest, I really dislike the original photo. My make-up is a mess, as well as my skin. I look so red. Awful.
Isn’t the point of all these puns to make people laugh? It’s FUN to be clever and witty and whatnot, and I think that occasionally you cross some lines for the sake of a joke.
Where are the jobs bills that the freshmen legislators promised? Where are the infrastructure projects to repair our crumbling country? Where are intelligent ideas to move our economy forward? All these seem to be caught under the determination of Republicans to do nothing—except try to defeat the opposition.
I mean, they have to have some space-age technology that's not hindered by rain, right? Fucking hell... they PLAY football in the rain. Why can't I WATCH it?
I have to get some housework done today. I've been so busy lately that I haven't done much around the house and with the weather so nice, I really should get some spring cleaning started. Have a terrific day everyone!
Pours exactly the same as the Harvest. A nice roasted malt aroma filled the nose but not much else was present. Full flavored beer with nicely balanced hop and malt characters. If you’re looking for a simple and great fall beer this is for you. Nothing out of the ordinary, just plain good. Medium body which is perfect for the fall weather.
And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.

Matthew 26: 59-60:
The risque-ness and very confident, fashion forward ‘LDN wildchild’ feel of this video places it on a higher plane in terms of how it’s received which I think works well for her. I won’t run my keyboard about it, just check it out – maybe even thrice over. I had to watch it four times over at first though I loved it instantly. I mean, for Pete’s sake, with the red lip feature and immaculate styling for starters, it’s difficult to see fault in this music video. What I think of the actual lyrics and vocals et cetera may not fare as much with what I think of the aesthetics, but I think it’s a pretty dope song she’s got here. It also helps that she teamed up with some of the best artists in the world right now.
Yadda, yadda, yadda. Alcohol Concern and Drinkaware are given ample space to say the usual stuff, but this is really a non-story. One age group is bound to drink more than the rest. It is a statistical inevitability.

I have decided that this is the year that my family will be debt free (with the exception of our mortgage)!! I am now a licensed insurance agent and that means I will be making commissions. I am going to use those commissions along with my VA and affiliate marketing income to start paying off our bills and to get the things that we need by paying cash. I really feel this is an accomplishable goal. We only have two credit cards, one doctor bill and one home improvement/business loan to pay off.

A while back, I posted news of how I might have played cricket for Yorkshire if only I'd known at the time that I needed spectacles - and that, had I done so, I might have had the miserable experience of spending a career opening the batting with Geoffrey Boycott (HERE).
The media regularly cover awards for their reporters, editors and producers. They regularly cover award ceremonies for movie stars, athletes, and business leaders. But they regularly ignore the far more important awards for people who ethically blow the whistle on corruption and suppression in both business and government, risking their careers and more to tell the truth to the American people.

After lunch, we went down the street to visit the Victor Hugo museum (Maison de Victor Hugo). He lived in this building on the corner, between John’s shoulder and the gate, on the “second floor” – i.e. 3rd floor for us Americans.

Waking up at 7:00am on a Sunday morning just doesn’t seem right. It’s probably that I don’t want to miss anything. Or that I’m missing something. Two cups of Civet coffee later (yes, I’m still drinking that cat poop coffee), I’m a little wired, pondering the day and reflecting on the week that flew by.
I lay there, listening to the rain and the cars swishing by in the wet road, thinking "Thank God the snow is done and melted and I can start going for walks again." So nice to think that spring is getting here and the white is being replaced by green. Even if it is still cold.

Is there a single non-Muslim and non-Trot who has even a second’s worth of time for this despicable little exhibitionist tyrant-lover? No one else outside his IslamoTrot tiny circle of friends takes him seriously anymore (if they ever did). He is an utter buffoon and an unashamed exhibitionist. He will say anything and do anything to get himself on TV. That’s why he pretends to believe in so many outrageous and absurd things – all before breakfast. It is only the absurd and the extreme which will guarantee him a slot on TV and keep his tacky little Respect career afloat. Aren’t his supporters not even a tiny bit embarrassed by this master-fool? Unless all of his supporters are deranged IslamoTrots. And nothing is too foolish and absurd for them. They thrive off such things.

I know some of you must be saying "OMGOSH....this woman is slow"...LOL!!! I do take a good bit of time on my armatures. I start with twisted wire and then put it in the shape that I want. Then I wrap the wire with white florist tape. As I'm wrapping I am also building out areas...like the shoulders, hiney and such. I have discovered that I don't have to use as much clay when I actually shape the armature a bit more. Once it is all taped, I apply a thin layer of white glue. Ya know....plain old school glue!! Works wonders!! This gives the armature added strength plus it gives a better surface for the clay to adhere to.

A well written article from Praag about the entitlement culture of the American Blacks. The best line of the piece for me is the following: 'As has been true throughout human history, the dependents America has nurtured will eventually destroy her'. How true. Liberal Whites have always treated the USA Blacks as if they were born without an IQ. Now, the lie repeated over the years has become truth and the mastermind of the lie will become the victim of his own folly.

The boat owners are mostly Tamils themselves. Many of them worked for the terrorist Tamil Tigers during the war, smuggling weapons and supplies to the Tigers’ fighters. One-way passage for a single man can run as high as 500,000 rupees ($A10,450). But most smugglers, realising their clients’ limited means, will take 100,000 rupees ($A2090) upfront with the balance paid when the passenger reaches the destination.
So in the last few days I have read two potty training books (Yeah, its kinda weird, but think about what a prepared mommy I will be, plus I baby-sit so its good to know anyways) which have taught me SOOOO much more about the importance of cloth diapers, as well as the importance of early potty training!
All pubs/restaurants have a website, most of them listing their menu/card.

For eight months at Americal headquarters in Chu Lai during 1968-69, Powell had worked with Donaldson and apparently developed a great respect for this superior officer. When the Army charged Donaldson with murder on June 2, 1971, Powell rose in the general’s defense.

Well let’s look at the Clive Davis and her staff. Why would Whitney be advised to come to Hollywood the entire week leading up to the Grammy’s? She wasn’t the type of person who could control herself, so God help the people who were trying to control her. Her own brother-in-law/bodyguard spoke during her funeral of his concern with how mad she would be if he entered her hotel room, even though he knew something wasn’t right. Only to soon find her lifeless body.

Yet the SAPS found it absolutely necessary to raid a working-class Afrikaans high school at gunpoint, and undertake searches of 350 pupils’ belongings. And when they find a few schoolboys with harmless, ordinary, non-narcotic cigarettes, these children are treated as common criminals -- for doing what schoolboys all over the world have been doing for the past two centuries: sneaking a few cigarettes…

Be that as it may, Kilgore points out that the analysis is interesting because it shows that it isn't the wingnuts who have been "purging" the moderates in primaries --- it's a generational changeover, mostly fueled by retirements. There are reasons for the subsequent shift to the right, but it's not just because voters are assholes who don't understand how the world works.
The Bond Consultant was sure that there had to be an error somewhere in the system, and the application was resubmitted to all the major banks. On round No.2 ABSA bank finally approved R311.500 but demanded a cash deposit of R88.500. Now I ask you with tears in my eyes, why are the banks doing this? Where must we suddenly get R88.500 for a deposit? Besides the evidence of my son’s healthy bank balance, secure job, his monthly income in the strong currency of the British Pound, PLUS the guarantee that a rental agreement will be covering the entire bond payments every month, the banks simply refuse to cooperate.
Then, she got to hang out at the barn for several more hours with her friend and sister while the boys and I went into town. I believe she got to scoop horse poop. This was actually exciting for her.
What I especially like is this illustration of the space station on the blackboard. It gives me the idea that the children are encouraged to have knowledge that their parents didn't. Teaching them to master the possible future they would grow up in.
- For the remainig two-thirds of the flour, Reinhart gives a choice of either bread dough or "clear flour," a coarser flour with a higher content of bran and ash than bread flour.

Kid Auto Races isn’t much on its own, but it does do one interesting thing: it selectively breaks the fourth wall. It makes the camera Chaplin’s mugging in front of the same one we see him through. I liked the creativity of this, and the cheekiness—Kid Auto Races, like some other Keystone shorts I’ve seen, remind me a lot of the Warner Brothers cartoons that would come along twenty years later. Same snarky spirit; same immunity to convention.

The one unit you really need to watch out for are Vikings. If your opponent masses Vikings (in large numbers these are extremely good against Protoss air), then you’ll need to respond with a lot of Phoenix. They really don’t do that much damage against Vikings, but you’ll like their capability to act as shields for the rest of your air force—a Viking needs 9 attacks to kill a Phoenix, and to kill a Void Ray, a Viking will need… 10 attacks. So a Phoenix will take nearly as much time to kill as a Void Ray. Phoenix are also fast, and can chase enemy Vikings that run.

Ne part of the story I had always heard, but hadn’t understood, until today was that the Pharisees were very upset. They told Jesus to tell the people to stop saying these things. Then Jesus told the Pharisees that even if the people were to stop the very rocks would declare it. So in my mind I never understood why Jesus didn’t tell the people to shut up so the rocks would declare it. How much more of a miracle would that be? That would be awesome! Creation itself would acknowledge God before man. So I just always thought that God didn’t want to perform on command for the Pharisees another miracle they wouldn’t believe. I didn’t get what Jesus was saying or showing. It went right over my head until today when Pastor Phil spoke about it.

I can’t say that I was bowled over by Ska’s entry into the milk stout category; it was good enough I suppose. I'm partial to all stouts and porters anyway. My notes from last Friday state: “Dark coffee color, almost opaque. Quick tan head with medium lacing. Faint coffee taste, slight sour finish then gone.” I suspect that, served on tap in some dimly lit bar in southern Colorado, this stuff is dynamite. I'll buy this again, if the price is right. I also like Ska's website and suddenly wish I could be in Durango today – especially since it’s going to hit 90 degrees here at Beer Rant Headquarters this afternoon! Browsing Ska's other beers, I’m also feeling inclined to go out and find some of their imperial porter!

Somehow, my fascination with confidence doesn't seem to be as compelling as my fascination with doubt. Many of us may consciously (or subconsciously) desire to possess the arrogant bravado of a cocky showman. Perhaps it's not to the extent that we wish to flounce about stage in a Harlequin leotard, sure, but there is a lot to be said for having faith that there is value in who we are and what we do. I suppose I yearn for those subtle indicators of doubt in those I admire, as a reminder that although these doubts are universal, we are all capable of achieving great things.
Although I received many books over the holidays I didn't take appropriate photographs, plus there were just so many, that I figured the best bet in discussing what books I had gotten was to start over again in the new year. My first week of mail when I returned home after the holidays was definitely a welcome batch of awesomeness that I look forward to reading.

As long as my fellow Virginians (and fellow Americans) decided to take a hysterical step into the past with this last week s election, I decided to dive headfirst there myself, back to my natural spot in time, medieval Europe, home of turkey drumsticks, lusty wenches and incredibly handsome long-haired men in kilts and tights.
I feel quite differently about that one and what I was doing in it now. It leads to a strange, uncanny feeling now when I read it aloud. A lot of the things I wrote and felt about Christianity then were less informed, not necessarily from a religious point of view. My empathy had some intellectual weakness in it. If you really subscribe to the enlightnment, which I’d like to think I do, there’s something patronizing about the piece. I feel like it’s ultimately a snapshot of a mind that was trying to crawl out of some stuff.
As I scrolled down the list, however, I couldn't help but think, "Wait, where are the Cowboy and Indians parties?"
It is not about being weak or easily influenced. It’s about being flexible and willing to evolve just as language itself evolves. And this is something that applies to all aspects of leadership – not just communication. A part of being a great leader is being able to take on ideas from other people, and constantly learn and update your ways of thinking.

The drive home was a short one. The park sat in the adjoining neighborhood and he only needed to take a couple of side-streets to get there. The only real effort was avoiding the numerous potholes that littered the road. Eventually, someone would complain enough and they’d send a group of workers out to fill them with asphalt. Then, like clock-work, they would erode again and cause some poor, unsuspecting motorist to bend a rim.

Maybe this is just because I've read and written so much about war, and because so much of my family has served in war (including the Iraq war). Maybe it's also because when I sent in my resume for consideration as a private contractor in Iraq subcontracted to Halliburton that I was very, very clear about just what kind of shitstorm that would entail. I would likely have been one of the folks in the video decrying the abuses of Halliburton as far as waste and endangering soldiers' lives, but I don't know that I'd have been upset because Halliburton put me in a war zone.

Consciousness involves knowledge. Before we can willfully do what God commands and what pleases Him, we must first understand what it is that God requires. From the law comes a knowledge of righteousness.
Up until relatively recently all oranges were bitter. They originated – as did all varieties, right down to the tangerine and the kumquat – from China, and go back 3,000 years. Arab traders brought them to Europe at the end of the Roman Empire, along with spices, silk and sugar, and the main crop was established around the area of Seville, in Andalucia, hence the name we English know them by. The skin of the bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) is distinct from its sweet cousin (C. sinensis) in that it is baggy and heavily dimpled, reminiscent of cellulite. Here in Southern California, bitter oranges are often left to rot on the branch, untouched and overlooked, but up until the nineteenth century it was the bitterness that people prized the most. The aromatic peel and sharp juice were symbols of opulence and sensuality, and the flowers were distilled and used to flavour food as well as to perfume baths and make-up.
Today, we spent a few hours at the hospital, where Peach was getting the last two of 12 shots she's had over the last 12 days (two, every other day). The shots take only a few minutes, but we have to stay for observation for two hours in case she has an allergic reaction. While we waited, we snuggled up in the hospital bed together, watching the rain outside. I held her close and kissed her fuzzy head, and we decided that this was the best Mother's Day gift ever. And it was.

On our way back out of the park several hours later, we again stopped by the chimpanzee habitat and caught the tail end of the same lecture. There was a new keeper giving the lecture this time and like the one from the morning, he opened up the floor for anyone in the crowd to ask him questions about the chimpanzees.
Our goal is to help every day people to make profits while helping other good every day people. Asking the bank for loans has never been harder and banks charge big huge interests!
In Dubai, Koko goes on a shopping trip with Valmet while Jonah is taking lessons from Tojo, but the boy ditches class. Assassin duo Orchestra – teenage girl Chinatsu and her nameless mentor – interrupt Koko’s date. A gunfight between the rival teams ensues, with Jonah jumping into the fray in the nick of time. The rest of Koko’s team arrives soon after, but Valmet takes a shot to the leg. Jonah rushes in, guns blazing, to allow her and Koko to escape. Lehm stops him, however, bringing him to the ground with a makeshift tripwire and hauling him out of trouble. He lectures him for attempting to sacrifice his life needlessly and tells him to escape with Koko, while he and Valmet cover them. Orchestra soon run out of ammo, however, so they retreat to their heavily armed pickup. Lehm and Valmet rendezvous with the HCLI team and set off in pursuit.

I don’t want to pin just anything up on the Pinterest site. It needs to be in keeping with the story – which is of an urban wedding (NYC) between the jewelry-making daughter of an Italian restaurant chain owner (well-to-do), and a Shakespeare scholar, who also happens to be an English Lord. (Yes, it’s a romance story!!) It’s also a Fall wedding, which’ll make a difference to some of the pics.

This leads me to a point of distinction between the Kingdom believer and the member of the Body of Christ during this age of grace. For those who were under the kingdom programme they had this promise of Matthew 28:20. The Lord told them, “Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.” This is repeated in Hebrews 13:5. “He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”
While it's good that another bad guy is now headed to meet his 72 Virgins who look like Joy Behar, the downside is that's a batch of intelligence on possible terror attacks that has been silenced.
Although I couldn’t put the book down, it really did creep me out. It’s the sort of thing you read with all the lights on. In fact, I even skimmed a few pages for the sake of wanting to be able to get to sleep that night. Especially towards the end, the story takes a turn straight to disturbing and depressing. Again, this is in line with the Gothic horror and tragedy of the 1818 novel.

These are the other pants that I really love that matches the shirt above which these are valued at $92.95. I am really going to have to get these and the matching shirt. I would feel awesome in these and at the same time look great lol at least my hubby would think so. I have found so many others pants and tops that I would love to purchase along with the pair that I reviewed. They are great and feel good too.

Now, while picking achieve as my word does pertain to actually getting stuff done, the real crux of choosing this word was so that at then end of the year I didn't feel like I had let it slip by. Our time is finite, and I do need to take a more active role in my life. (Yesterday's shooting in AZ really sorta drives this point home for me.)
Today marks the 50th anniversary of the very first human space flight, April 12, 2011. On this night, 50 years ago, Russian Cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin completed an orbit around the earth. He became an instant international celebrity and a heor of the Soviet Union. Today, space flight and exploration isn't as new as it was then, but it's stilll exciting! Everybody's doing the moonwalk.
This L.O looks a little top heavy to me...I think it's the big flowers, but I loved this photo of my niece and nephew..and Athina's head was cropped so I added a flower mmmmm....not a good move what do you think...I also journaled on the flowers, I liked that!
And I'm not complaining. I'm really interested in the kind of reader that likes non-obvious books. I think there are enough of them across different countries and over time to create a respectable audience for demanding fiction and unuusual prose. but today's market wants a mass appeal now, in the first few months of a book's life. It wants synchronic not diachronic readerships, if you like.
Now that that has been settled how do you go about

What is clear is that third is the only guarantee of entering the Champions League next season; the squad and manager have spoken frequently that this is their target, how their destiny is in their own hands so now is the time to prove it. Nobody said it would be easy and true to Arsenal traditions, they are going about achieving their targets the hard way.
You cannot unschool only until you disapprove of what your children choose to do. If you're happily "unschooling" during a time when your children are willingly and by choice doing math workbooks and reading the classics daily, but quickly step in with enforced curricula when your children instead start choosing to play games and read back issues of People magazine for a while, you weren't unschooling in the first place. If you don't plan on respecting your children's choices in learning even when you'd prefer they be doing something else, then you're not unschooling.
I liked that Sub-Mariner waged a war against humankind while simultaneously helping us. Makes for a very conflicted character, more interesting than many of the goody two-shoes superheroes of the era.
What was expected to be the depressing final chapter of a motorsport legacy, turned out to be (to the surprise of all) the blossoming of a new and uplifting chapter in the Pescarolo story. During yesterday’s liquidation sale, OAK Motorsport team owner Jacques Nicolet and Joel Rivière, owner of Prestige Racing, secured the purchase of vital PescaroloSport assets. The joint venture saw the pair acquire both Pescarolo P01 chassis, in addition to an array of assorted technical support equipment (valued at over US $550,000) crucial to team operations.
First cab off the rank was this sweet little red cardigan for Ivy. I made it in a red merino bamboo. It's so lovely and soft and because of the bamboo it has a really lovely weight to it. I like a weighty hang, don't you?
I wasn’t planning on my last post for A to Z sounding so much like a mini literary analysis, but the book lends itself to discussion, academic or otherwise, and would be a great springboard for discussions with students about race and segregation in the U.S. post-Civil War.

Brands I’ve always liked are Shu Uemura, L’Occitane, Jurlique, and Aesop. All of them make great cleansers that clean very thoroughly without drying me out, and smell fantastic – Shu Uemura’s Foaming Cleansing Water, L’Occitane’s Imortelle Brightening Cleansing Foam, and Aesop’s Amazing Face Cleanser especially. I rotate between these three.
I find it interesting that my becoming anarchist went hand-in-hand with my embracing of unschooling. Coming out of a not-so-great time in my early to mid teenage years, a time characterized by feelings of depression, of feeling like an outcast, and of not knowing who I was as a person or what I should be doing, I started reading extensively about both unschooling and anarchism. And, not long after I decided, with both relief and a new found conviction, that unschooling really had been the right thing for me, and really was an amazing way of looking at and living Education, I finally found a political view that truly spoke to me, that felt right in the most fundamental way.
I watched it all from my vantage point on the table as they were stitching me up and couldn't stop smiling. I had no idea what they were doing to me at this point and was only focused on her. However, according to photographic evidence, they were quite busy down there. Don't worry, I won't share those pictures. I think you've already seen enough blood and guts for one post.
Madame led us to our “hotel” and we were on our own. Again we were apparently dealing with the owner but we were now communicating in sign language. The restaurant owner spoke perfect German but neither the hotel owner nor anybody else did. The hotel owner showed us where to put our bikes in a locked storage shed and then led us upstairs from the bar, which was obviously the main business of the place, where he indicated we could choose a room. We took the largest, naturally, and it also happened to be next to the bathroom. It was good that the room was big. One of Maun’s panniers had leaked and she had some wet things and in the big room we had room to spread them out. We did this and then walked back through the very small town back to the restaurant.

First, grab the sides of the foil and lift the bar out of the baking dish. Place that onto a cutting board. Then you can easily pull down the sides of the foil so you can cut the bars, after this next step.
In the interest of full disclosure, my personal experience with autism, particularly the past 3-4 years, has not been all that difficult. My son is an absolute joy. We do not experience any of the behavioral issues that other parents face, at this point he has very few sensory issues that affect his daily life (I'm not talking about school, that's a whole other ball game) he is not rigid, he is not inflexible, he deals with change very easily. He's got tons of quirks and stims, and his expressive language skills cause him, and me, a great deal of difficulty and frustration, but that's okay; we deal with things as they come and we all love each other very much.
Right there, on the streets of Bath, there was a camera shop.
I looked closely at her bookshelf to help me decide which of her twenty novels was my favorite, and I have to say, it was a toss-up between three of them. I like them all, of course, but these three stood out for different reasons. One made me laugh almost continuously (many, if not all of them make me laugh out loud at least once), one I felt was her steamiest, and one was her most romantic, all in my humble opinion. And when I checked, none of these three were RITA finalists, which surprised me. But I digress.

Another “flaw” of the book (and probably the biggest problem of the novel for myself), and one that could potentially make readers extremely uncomfortable, was the whole Season part. The Season is the ships term for mating season. The docile members of Godspeed during “The Season” strip off their clothes, grab the nearest member of the opposite sex, and start having sex anywhere they please. I found this a little uncomfortable. Maybe that was the point of the Season was to make people think, and feel uncomfortable, but I felt the random sex would popup in scenes where it wasn’t really necessary.
While Gen. Azazi did not rule out the poverty, economic constraints (economic alienation as US Ambassador Carson puts it) and the dearth of opportunities in the North as supplementary cause of the new Boko Haram, I interpreted his speech to mean that, the metamorphosis of Boko Haram has principally been driven by political interests. The old Boko Haram has evolved into a political Boko Haram.
As voters ready themselves to vote in November, it would be wise to revisit the way Obama hid his true past from them in 2008 and since. His college records were sealed, his Indonesian adoption records were sealed, his passport file was sealed and, of course, his official birth records were sealed. He has since provided a birth certificate that an investigation by Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently asserted was a complete forgery. His first executive order in office was to put these and other documents off limits to public examination.

One of those things that we've been getting a lot of are Sidekicks, and they are a bugger to keep tidy. They don't stack like cans, they fall over if they don't rest on something, etc. So I was planning on getting some sort of container for them, to sit them all in, BUT when I was shopping at the grocery store and went to buy more Sidekicks, I got the perfect idea to organize them. See where this is going? No?

I chose to create a card with the cute little girl - because she looks just like my little girl - those cheeks and that black hair! so cute! I created a little house for her with different papers and scored the roof and sponged it and then created a little window for her to peek out of. I colored her in with copics and added a little glaze to her hair :) and some rose to her cheeks!
Well, my first thought is WHAT?!?! Nowhere on the website did it mention ANY of these extra costs. My total was supposed to be $39! We are on a SERIOUS budget and I did not plan on spending $13.70 extra. To some people that would be no big deal, but to ME, it IS! At this point it was TOO LATE to cancel my order!

The convention proposal was to "raise awareness" that ***** exists and that it's also more common in those of Irish heritage; 1 in 50 is a carrier. As was expected (and feared) the proposer was a mother whose child had *****. I could have let it go I guess, but I could see how this trend was developing so I stood up to speak against.

So we learnt about air density, and that cold air is more dense than hot air. I love this book - after it describes the experiment step by step, there are two sections: 'why does it work?' and 'how does this apply to the real world?' - giving really clear, concise explanations.

A recent study done by Crisil Research said that FCCBs worth Rs 20,000-22000 crore could be either redeemed or see a downward revision in their conversion price. The fear is that companies which have a strained balance sheet, weak financial performance and low promoter holding will find it tough to meet their repayment obligation on their outstanding FCCBs.
It hurts to get these rejections, true, and it is discouraging. A friend who is a famous American novelist put me out of my misery. Drop it, he said, and get writing your next book. Reluctantly I put it behind me, and started on a fresh page.
For some reason, my mind keeps remembering that day when my math teacher accused me of cheating on the math test. I was 11, we had geometry and I had, uncharacteristically, studied for the test. I aced it. The only A in the class. It was definitely unbelievable, even to me. Looking back over the years of barely scraping by with Cs, I can now see how the teacher had to accuse me of cheating. Except I didn't. And it kinda broke my heart.

Orange! Really orange. Like Home Depot orange. I was a little weary of the colour at first but after the first wall I found that I loved it. And as I posted up my pics on Facebook my friends said they loved it too. The ugly faux trim could not be left so I decided to paint it out a simple white. Nice contrast to the laminate floor and the wall itself.
My prayer today -- May the Holy Spirit touch the hearts of man, that they embrace the call to suffer for sake of their neighbor and family and church, as Christ has suffered for us. In Jesus name, Amen.
Checkpoint 303’s music is a mix of drum and bass, experimental, breakbeats, dubstep, and, on occasion, electro acoustic. But it is not, insists SC MoCha “world music”. Let us be clear, “world music makes everything that isn’t Anglo-Saxon, European or American as other. It’s like putting all the rest of the world, which is probably 99% of the music produced, into one bucket. It basically comes from the industry, they needed to find a name to put all the other stuff under.”

Galloway is a member of Parliament by the grace of an electorate in the East End of London but is widely regarded as a corrupt scumbag, an egomaniac, an apologist for tyranny, and a supporter of jihad. How would he phrase his complaint if someone were now to propose overruling his voters and offing him as the insult to humanity that he has become? I think I can hear the squeals of self-pity already.
"No, but how is it good for your brain?"
I have a few movies I like to watch even if they are not very good in some ways and have bombed at the box office when first released. Howard the Duck is one of those movies. Here in Stockholm I remember it opened in cinemas and was gone again maybe within a month or so. At least it was gone very quickly due to few viewers and even poorer reviews in the papers.

The sold vehicle arrived to my shop on a tow truck shortly before terminating my brother-in-law. I’d asked what was happening, was told it was no big deal, just some minor problems that my brother-in-law would look after. The young man who’d purchased the vehicle dealt only with my brother-in-law, I saw him through the shop windows, but never had even spoken to him.
Bake the toasts for about 25 minutes, until lightly browned. Transfer to a rack. The toasts will crisp as they cool. When cooled, store in an airtight container at room temperature.
The result: a beautiful, elegant dish that would make a beautiful Valentine's Day dinner. In fact, I think it's going to make it into my Valentine's Day Menu coming up soon. I love these Supperclub Challenges because what it shows me again and again is that being compassionate is really not a challenge at all. Next time someone says vegans can't enjoy a thick, juicy steak, prove them wrong with my Seitan Steak in Beurre Blanc Sauce with Oven-Baked French Fries.
All in all, a sad end to Volume one of Jonah Hex. Jonah acts out of character turning down the money, one minute he appears to be happy about having Cindy around and the next he ignores her. I always wished that this book could have made it to issue 100, but on a bimonthly schedule, 8 more issues would be over another year of very poor sales.

I decided not to countersink them and fill the holes with putty because you would still be able to see the putty circles after I was done since I wasn't sanding/painting over it. I wanted to let the wood grain show through to give it a simlar look to the weathered coffee table. I've actually seen nails/screws showing on other rustic pieces and I'm down with the look, so it wasn't a big deal to me at all.
These last couple weeks have been kind of hard on me. I started my new job and besides it taking up way too much of my time, I can’t complain. My co-workers are nice, the day goes by relatively quickly, and although it’s a big company they are very relaxed about things like taking lunch breaks (or more like not taking lunch breaks so I can leave earlier) and what time I start.

Anyway, do me a favor and say a prayer, send up good vibes, do a rain dance - whatever it is you subscribe to - that his leg gets fixed and he's back on his feet and back in the garage being a pain in the ass ASAP. Leave him a nice comment and next week I'll print it off and take it to him so he knows he's got a bunch of support.
The rest of the taut little film plays out like a cat-and-mouse game as Brennan uses just about everything available to him – including the use of Doretta as sexual bait to lure one of the outlaws – to keep himself and the woman alive.

Ralegh's appeal to the Indians was more positive and personal. He gathered all he could of the tribes together, and told them that he had been sent by his Cacique to set them free from the Spaniards, for he was 'the servant of a Queen who was the great Cacique of the North, and a virgin, who had more caciques under her than there were trees in the island'. The metaphor is the earliest instance of his quickness to understand the native mind. Already he saw how impossible it was for them to take in anything of actual numbers; time and space, as well as people, could not be measured, only suggested by some vivid pictorial image.
4) The vain hope for worldly significance for His lasting honor - The Lord knew that in the heart of every man is the desire for self-exaltation, to “be noticed by men” and to “love the place of honor” and to “be called leaders” (Matthew 23:5-10). Yet He calls us to a life of humility, self-denial, and service. What are the rewards for so living? As the Parable of the Talents and other places show, Christ gives His servants responsibilities and gospel knowledge in this world to invest in the kingdom of God. If they are faithful, He will pronounce them so on the day of judgment. He will give them eternal honor and responsibility in the new heavens and the new earth (Matthew 25:14-30). Even the smallest of works done unto Him will be greatly blessed (Matthew 10:42; 25:31-40).
There’s been a series of emails firing back and forth through our department this morning discussing the possibilities here, and what has been pointed out by Graeme Eagles – something of an expert in plate motions – is that the India-Australia plate is under a really acute stress regime as it gets split into 3 and twisted. That leads to these large build ups, and eventual release under strike-slip.

But there was life in the old boys yet. A 1947 tour of England played to sold out crowds. In the late 40s their earlier films started to be shown on television and they began to receive a huge new flood of fans – more than they had ever enjoyed in the past. Their last film Robinson Crusoe-land a.k.a. Utopia a.k.a Atoll K was bizarre and atrocious, ending their cinema career on a sour note. But they squeezed in another successful tour before strokes felled both Laurel (1955) and Hardy (1956). Hardy passed away in 1957.

His misophonia has gotten much worse just during the past couple of weeks. He has so many more triggers now -- not just chewing/eating but breathing, yawning, coughing and certain speech sounds set him off. I laugh now (bitterly, before tossing back a couple of fingers of whiskey or vodka) when I think how stressful things were when he was "only" set off by eating/chewing sounds.

What the Mail has done is present the figures so as to make the ballot sound as close and unfair as possible in order to fit with its own political agenda. Had they reported the ballot fairly, they would have been forced to acknowledge that support for a strike in the five businesses concerned was solid. The full results of the ballots can be found in the links to the pdf documents at the bottom of this press release. Those results show that in three of the five ballots the total voting ‘yes’ was more than 50% of those entitled to vote. If you were to amalgamate the votes in the ballots that supported the strike (you shouldn’t of course, but just for fun) you’d find that the results were as follows:

I laughed when other older women were trying to figure out how to wear a scandalous shirt (many cut out areas, backless and a gold chain halter tying it all together. Yes, scandalous) I retired from my college days. One woman said she couldn’t possibly wear it, have a photo taken in it and end up on Facebook, because she would surely be fired.

The simple truth is that most fee-charging agencies make their money off the authors they represent, selling everything from representation to critiques to editing services. Selling the rights to your book is often an afterthought. If you decide to consider this type of agency (which I do not recommend), ask the agent a simple question before sending your first payment: Where has the agency placed works for the authors they represented in the past? If the only answer they can give is that they have placed manuscripts with a “sister company” of the agency, you might be better off investing your money elsewhere.

Borgia sends off a message, via dove (I can’t help but wonder where he’s getting the dove from), to Cesare, ordering him to scare up some cash from the Borgia monestaries to pay off a few of the cardinals. The details of the payoffs are then hidden in the cardinals’ special dinners. Clever, Borgias. The cardinals all seem pleased with their unexpected little gifts. Still, Borgia fails to secure the majority at the next vote. He sends yet another message to Cesare, who sends Juan to their monasteries to get even more money.
One boy was thrilled to find a spice rack sitting on the "Free" table.
The song is a sort of piss take on Jailhouse Rock on Elvis, as is obvious from both the style of the music, the accent and the lyrics. Its very 1950s, with more than a dollop of mind bending psychedelia especially when it comes to the solos. The lyrics themselves are intensely political. 10cc is a British art-rock band, and the song alludes, intentionally or accidentally, to the then ongoing intense conflict in Northern Ireland, and the use of rubber bullets there. For all these reasons Rubber Bullets a gem of a song, and the 70s aesthetics on show throughout the film clip is only the icing on the cake.

Now of course there are a few things that we need to understand first before we dive headlong into this phrase. I am well aware that Jesus was not purposely here giving us his philosophical treatise on human nature. I know that the context is that of prayer and that he was making a comparison by contrasting one extreme with the other all in the attempt to help his audience understand that God answers his children’s prayers. But, as often times happens with Jesus, everything that came out of his mouth was so packed full of truth and can be applied in many different contexts. I believe there is another issue here that is abundantly clear.

SA's Minister of Rural Development and Land Affairs Gugile Nkwinti warned on March 2 2010 at a press conference that 90% of all the 'redistributed farms' were unproductive, with 5,9-million hectares of these formerly white-owned, productive farms laying idle, its once so modern, well-developed, multi-billion Rand infrastructures stripped and vandalised by looters. He blamed the entire problem on 'foreign-land ownership' however – threatening to crack down hard, saying:

The book gives a broad overview of how the current copyright monopoly is starting to degrade free speech and people’s privacy. Internet censorship proposals have become commonplace and alleged pirates are punished without due process, all without any clear evidence that more stringent measures actually cause a decline in piracy.

By getting out now, he can keep his hopes alive for a 2016 race if Obama wins, and maybe push his way into a gig at FOX or one of the alphabet networks as a talking head. As a good example of the kind of phoney 'conservative' boogie man the Left adores parading, I'd be surprised if the offers weren't already coming in.
But socialism did not grow organically from toryism. It is rather that toryism by the sixties was a spent force. It left behind a political culture that put strong emphasis on law and saw government in a more positive light than Americans did. But Baby Boomers and left-wing intellectuals resented the fact that Canada had always been part of the British Empire – by now identified with totalitarianism in the popular imagination. So Canadians elected Trudeau to build his “Just Society,” expanding the state and continuing the program of iconoclasm started under Pearson.
They say if you do 10 mins of hula hooping a day you can lose 2 inches in one month. I have been doing the hula hoop on the Wii Fit for 10 mins as I unlocked it on the super hula. Of course I doubt I could keep a regular hula hoop up any other way. Also, hula hooping helps improve your core strength.

Recently the government’s department of rural development has been airing proposals to nationalise productive farmland as a “national asset”. Critics claim it is designed to deflect criticism from the ruling ANC’s failures.

Another key reason we haven’t intervened directly is that laws designed to prevent birds being targeted by egg collectors, thieves and people wanting to otherwise harm them mean that if we were to access the nest to remove the chicks we would almost certainly be committing a criminal offence under the terms of the Wildlife & Countryside Act.
If Kaz was here today I'm sure she would be pissing herself laughing, she might even suggest that Dave should stay in touch with his feminine side and that he should make a huge comeback as Jaunty Jane the nubile nun from Norfolk... then at least we wouldn't have to read all the dreary cricket posts.

Similarly, the writer Charles “Cannibal” Miller — a prewar version of Bruce Parry — claimed to have taken part in a cannibal feast in the 1930s. Then again, he also said he’d spotted a 40ft dinosaur. Anthropologists say that cannibalism hasn’t been practised here for generations — if ever — but missionaries working in the further reaches of the valley are less sure.

When I walk into the house and he sees me (with much encouragement from his mom) he gets almost as excited to see me as I am to see him. He smiles from ear to ear, his hands and feet flail, and when I put my arms out to him, he reaches towards me as well. It is the most exhilarating feeling you could imagine.

24.ONE LAST WISH "This Time"
For my money, the absolute best kind of conflict to be had in a dungeon is between the players themselves. I want players to doubt their abilities, I want them to debate the proper plan of action, and I want them to be worried that one or the other of their party aren’t going to hold up their end of the bargain. You need a special group of players to do this well–you need players who like the ‘Role-playing’ part as much or more than the ‘game’ part. These players are able to separate their own emotions from the emotions their characters are feeling. They are in it for the story, not the reward at the end. When I introduce a conflict that forces their character to make a horrible decision (e.g. “You can hold on to your sword and be possessed by the daemon, but kill your enemy OR you can release the sword and watch your enemy escape with your lady love”), I want them to smile and say ‘that’s awesome’. Obviously it sucks for the character, but it makes for some fabulous fun for the player. These kinds of players don’t care so much about their character getting ‘better,’ though it is nice; they much prefer having fun with the character, even if they wind up begging for food in some alley somewhere, with only the memory of glory in their past (which is, of course, when the desperate young princess seeks them out and asks them to swing into the saddle one last time…but at a price).

Now, granted, both of these areas would be super easy for a Dwarf of my level of experience to simply walk through.

Beauregard launched a series of counterattacks from the Shiloh Church area by the early afternoon, hoping to ensure control of the Corinth Road. Although the Union Army’s right was temporarily driven back by these assaults, Union troops seized the road junction of the Hamburg-Purdy and East Corinth Roads, driving the Confederates into Prentiss’s old camps. Beauregard’s final counterattack was flanked and repulsed when Grant moved Colonel James C. Veatch’s brigade forward. Realizing that he had lost the initiative and that he was low on ammunition and food and with over 10,000 of his men no longer in action, Beauregard knew he he was in serious trouble. He withdrew the Confederate forces in an orderly fashion back to Corinth, Mississippi. The exhausted Union soldiers did not pursue much past the original Sherman and Prentiss encampments.
And while I'm still liable to break down into tears any second now, the point is this: I defended myself for what I thought needed defending, I asked for specific feedback instead of settling with generalizations, and I found a way to measurably improve the skills I was lacking in. I still feel like crap, (I'm sure no one ever feels good after someone tells them their completely inadequate) but hey, life goes on. I'm a bit scarred, and for the most part I won't be disclosing anything related to myself to any staff member for a good, long time. They can just think of me as some nomad or drifter with a counseling license for all I'm concerned.
So, I am on a roll this weekend falling in love with the DSP (Designer Series Paper) and here is yet another card set that I put together thanks to Cybil. This one I used all of the stamps in the Herb Expression stamp set. I have had it for months and only used one of the stamps from the set and now, I have used them all!
I think about the space between one culture and another, the space that is created from travel, the space that opens up in oneself from traveling within and understanding different worlds. I think about what it means to be a “third-culture” kid, as my cousin once named it, to have grown up between two countries, sometimes feeling like I did not belong to either, struggling to feel like I belong to both.
Right after I posted the last rant, cried a whole lot, wrote a bitter and negative email to my husband and cried some more, I finally checked my private email (a no-no at my job) and realized a message had come in from her social worker at 9:30am, right around when I was working myself up into a good cry.

When my parents visited again on Monday, we were ready for them, equipped with a few pizzas and our Flinch cards. We had a great time and lots of laughs, and the realization that, in the event of a blackout, we could play just as easily by lighting a few candles was satisfying too. No wires, no plug-ins, and no electricity needed; just camaraderie and conversation.
But also? It made me think. It made me re-assess how I DO parent, and made me look more carefully at WHY I parent as I do. And the outcome? I’ve become even more Free-Range! If THAT’S the mentality of others out there – paranoid, terrified, helicopter-ish to the max – then I know I *HAVE* to continue with Free-Range thinking and parenting more than ever, to ensure that my daughters grow up to be confident, strong, and capable, and to look at the world knowing that dangers do NOT lurk around every corner, that most people ARE good, and that they, themselves, are competent.
Dress front:
We believe that we are attractive based on what we have been told from a young age, we believe what we are capable of achieving in life from the words we heard as children, from our parents and their limiting beliefs and life experience. Our teachers told us that we were disruptive and so now, 25, 30 or even 40 years later we still believe this and act in a particular way.
Then there is the West Town Gallery Network ART HOP on Saturday too. It produces mixed feelings. It makes sense and all that, let’s coordinate, and get people out together, but it is a little cheesy too. Everyone gets a sticker at each gallery on the itinerary, and if you collect them all, you can enter the raffle to win a work of art (taking place at 6:30P at 40000). It is by the same artist who designed the WTGN’s current pamphlet. This time it is Deb Sokolow.
Humanistic Psychologist Carl Rogers believed that active listening was the most important trait a therapist could have, and that having a good listener in your life is essential to your happiness.

But is when COP Leader Prakash Ramadhar started to zest up he self and talk about poaching, and wanting back the mayorship whose “allocation” was given to him that I start to pause and check out the thing. It seems that Local Govt Politics has its own morality as well. at first I didn’t understand why Ramadhar felt it was his right to choose the mayor until I realised that in local government elections it’s the party with the most seats that consults with the councillors and other pertinent bodies to select a mayor. And since is a coalition government we have, and not a coalition party, the Fyzabad Accord (which beginning to sound like a kaiso) apparently delineated which parties within the coalition would get to determine which mayorships went to whom. So the COP got Arima and San Fernando as part of their historic 2010 scramble for Trinidad and Tobago. What startled me was that these arrangements were ironed out since May 2010, and Local Government Elections happened in July of 2010…so these parties were very confident of victory.
I did tell hubby that starting Monday, we are going to sit on the floor and stretch. He is going to get some elasticity to those muscles so that falling issue won't happen as much. I also told him that he needs to use his cane and walker when he needs it instead of being a hard head.
This year, Coney Island's off season has been particularly harsh. Many well-known businesses are not expected to reopen in the summer. Cha Cha's and Ruby's have served their last drinks and have, in turn, been served with eviction papers. Demolition crews are busy tearing down landmarks like the Bank of Coney Island. And in December 2010, Shoot The Freak was destroyed in a surprise attack by its landlord. “They came like thieves in the night,” the booth's owner told The Brooklyn Paper. “Those little sneaks emptied out the place and there is nothing left, except for the Shoot the Freak sign.” The cyclical nature of destruction and rebirth in Coney Island is currently in a valley of annihilation, as the city moves towards a sanitized version of the boardwalk.

We all talk to each other, to buyers, to marketing and we may even have some research to let us know who is reading our books. But these are numbers, not interactions with real people. This attention to the fan is what I believe has kept comics and will keep graphic novels alive, even in hard times… Imagine if you will a BEA, open to fans, where publishing showcases their best and the brightest they have to offer. How many would show up? How many would dress up like their favorite characters? Is this the type of passion that needs to be ignited in publishing in order to survive the hard times and build for the future?
That night, I prayed with Bill that he would always feel taken care of whether he is on earth with us or in Heaven with God... I want him to feel loved. I want him to always feel that. This evening, my mom called me and told me that they found a way to have my Grandpa live at his house with care. I can't explain my emotion other than I felt so much relief for him. Life is so precious and fragile, and I'm so glad that he is going to spend his time at his home. He deserves that...

This success enabled Cline to buy her dream home in Nashville’s Goodlettsville community, personally decorated in her style featuring gold dust sprinkled in the bathroom tiles and a music room. Loretta Lynn stated in a 1986 documentary interview, “She called me into the front yard and said, ‘Isn’t this pretty? Now I’ll never be happy until I have my Mama one just like it.’” Cline called her home “the house that Vegas built” since she was able to pay it off with the money she earned during her time there. (Later, after Cline’s death in 1963, Cline’s home was sold by her husband to singer Wilma Burgess who told Patsy Cline author Ellis Nassour that “strange occurrences” happened during her years there.)

The study was based on answers to the General Social Survey, which began asking people about their level of trust in various public institutions, including Congress and the Supreme Court, in the 1970s. The dip in trust toward the scientific community didn’t correlate to a decrease in trust for all political institutions, since conservatives showed increased trust in political institutions during the Bush presidency, but still found science suspicious.

“Coming of Age” was originally part of the third story in the “Chloe trilogy”. I’d like to publish the others, so here I’ll be vague about the content. For the first part, a friend’s comment prompted a story about Chloe’s punishment caning. It’s still one of my favorite masturbation fantasies. I presented the story to my friend as a gift and planned to end things there, but when she mentioned an upcoming shopping trip, my muse poked me again.
CHILI # 2 - AUSTIN'S AFTERBURNER CHILI
I’ve recently begun creating four large-ish canvasses to paint, and am looking forward to seeing what becomes of them. I’ve been thinking of painting an Elvis, a Johnny Cash, a Tom Petty, and a larger version of a Kurt Cobain drawing I have made. Though I’m not exactly certain which order I’ll paint them in. I’ve been more inspired lately by another idea. I kind of want to make a wacky painting of one of these crazy singers that you see auditioning for American Idol, you know, the guys in the pink bunny rabbit suits screaming, going for broke to get on the show? That stuff makes me crack up, and the idea of painting a successful version of a bunny rabbit vocalist is one of those things I find hilarious enough to actually work in an image. That’s when I say “Hey, if I’d put it on my wall, someone else would too!” LOL
Basically, I’m trying to accomplish in a simpler way what I was doing before. Since it’s not exactly the same, the results won’t be the same, but I’m expecting similar returns. I have adjusted size of my trades to account for an anticipated fewer number of total trades.

You get the picture. Sipping presents many opportunities for fun. If you have electricity, you can watch television, digital video discs, or maybe even surf the information superhighway and obsess about current events. If the power’s out, as it was for a good chunk of today in our neighborhood, you can entertain the kids with games of hide and seek, or fill up wash basins in the courtyard for them to cool off in.

After the passing of my grandfather, Mae remained in the trailer for a time, but eventually moved in with my parents on the farm where we had moved. She spent the next 11 years with them there. For a portion of that time, I lived right next door. I don't believe there was a day that went by that I didn't talk to her, if only on the phone. (I still remember her number!) She would call me to tell me the "news" that she had just read in the National Enquirer, always certain that it was,without a doubt, the truth. I would call to let her know what new thing one of the kids was doing, or how my work was going.

Critics say allowing more riders to go helmetless will add to motorcycle injury and death tolls in Michigan. They also say it will raise insurance costs for all motorists to help cover the increased risks to motorcyclists.
Nonetheless, social media shouldn’t be driven by making more money. It should be viewed as merely a compliment to the business strategies that have already been working. It isn’t that time consuming and is easier than ever to cross-post on multiple social networks. So why not give it a try and start reaping the benefits of digital interaction?
I started with The Cooker's recipe for some delicious Orange, Oats and Almond Muffins - they seemed delicious. K had a compensatory holiday last Friday, after her Sports Day in school and was bouncing off the walls at home. So we decided to bake - and she said she would do "everything". I helped her measure out the ingredients, and as she poured and stirred and whipped, she slowly took over the kitchen till the recipe morphed into something else with a life of its own!

Another example is Everett, WA. Everett designed a system that provides superior individual care while insuring that utilization (usage of medical and technology procedures) is cost efficient. Boeing, which self insures its employees, joined the program as an experiment to determine if employee health care costs could be reduced while providing quality health care. The result has been remarkable in both patient health care and cost savings.
Cook vermicelli for 3 minutes in hot water where we would have cooked the shrimp skin and head then discarded them, for more sea flavour. Then we drain and cut the long vermicelli with scissors about at least 2 cm length to make it easy for people when they’re enjoying the sbiaats/briouates.

After that experience I decided it would be a better idea if I let Loli teach me how to cook Spanish foods so that she could maintain the kitchen as her space. As we cooked paella Loli showed me the various steps of chopping vegetables, preparing the seafood to be cooked, and staying patient while the ingredients absorbed the flavors of each other. The final product of paella was gorgeous and absolutely delicious. I can’t wait to take a stab at making it on my own for friends and family in the States.

I liked that we got to see a few of Luce's previous lives, and I liked the constant action. There was no time while reading that I was bored or thought the pacing was slow. I sped through Passion because of this. The twist at the end was a bit obvious. I think we all knew something was up with Bill. I expected him to be someone else, though, so his true identity was a nice surprise.
On the quieter roads, and in particular, the hilly bits, there were words of encouragement painted across the roads. Thomas Voekler was obviously a favourite. I saw a couple of “Allez Cav”.

But I didn't initially see it. For the first day or two I was edgy. I was still upset with him. Any contact from him sent my anxiety through the roof. When he got home from work and was near me or talked to me, I wanted to back away. I wanted to hide. I was afraid.
Before I mention any of the other actors, I have to single out Angus Scrimm for bringing to life one of the most undeniably effective villains in a horror movies. His Tall Man is a nasty, steely-eyed, thin-faced demon who has such peculiar habits as bleeding yellow blood, regrowing severed fingers, speaking extremely few words and possessing the ability of being able to appear out of thin air. This is pure cinema magic we're watching here, kids; Angus Scrimm not only created a character, he created a legendary figure.

Well this particular evening the 18-year-old was in need of a ride home from work (I did list “chauffeuring” as one of my sidelines) and “work” was across the street from the gym. This night the husband was home so I quickly volunteered for the driving assignment ahead of time. I devilishly plotted to leave early from home to afford me twenty minutes to worship at the physical fitness temple. Furthering my scheme I informed the 18-year-old that his chauffeur would be “working out” and he should walk across the street to meet me at the gym and I would be finished by then and drive him back home. Everything went well. I escaped my responsibilities and was very proud of my sneaky tactic to get a few moments to myself. Having limited time I chose the treadmill as the “torture de jour”.
Future Media Concepts (FMC), the premier authorized digital media training organization for post-production, broadcast, and content creators, has announced that Oscar®-nominated Avatar editor, Stephen Rivkin, will be the keynote speaker at their first-ever IBC Digital Media Training Workshops, held from Saturday 11 – Sunday 12 September amid the world-renown IBC. Rivkin’s feature editing career began in 1979 with the low budget romantic comedy The Personals. Soon thereafter, he worked on a variety of TV movies and a mixture of comedy and action films, including Robin Hood: Men in Tights for director Mel Brooks, four films for director Norman Jewison, including: The Hurricane starring Denzel Washington; the action-thriller Swordfish with John Travolta, Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry;and Michael Mann’s bio pic Ali, starring Will Smith. Rivkin achieved monumental success editing the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise from 2003-2007, including two Eddie Award nominations and a win. His career culminated in 2009 with BAFTA and Oscar nominations alongside James Cameron and John Refoua for his revolutionary work on Avatar, the highest-grossing motion picture of all time. Rivkin will discuss the 2½-year challenge he faced while editing Avatar, and present various clips thattouch on Performance Capture, Virtual Cameras, 3D, and the stages of shot development and finishing that brought this film to life.

Who is the strongest character in your story? Watch out; that’s a trick question. Consider Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day. The main character, Stevens, is a weak man, yet his presence is as strong as a hero. How? Ishiguro gave him a voice that is absolutely certain, yet absolutely vacant of self-knowledge. We know Stevens, and because we see his limitations, we know things will be difficult for him. Don’t be afraid to give all the depth you can to your main character early in your story. You’ll discover much more about him later, and can always revise if necessary.
Just a quick note really just to apologise for the lack of blogging recently. I am insanely busy at the moment opening a new brewpub in the new Westfield at Stratford City.

Of course I will also need someone who will take on that father role for the kids I do have with me still. Who will take care of them and come to love them and all that obvious stuff. In line with that, someone that can accept how I got pregnant with G because I know that its not a typical situation and some people have been very quick to judge. These along with some other major things were things that I needed in a partner.

Anyone who is trying to be a public figure on the internet is going to get hate. Especially if they don’t couch their words and expect people to “get their point,” and ignore the details for the greater message. Because sometimes it’s the details that are the most hurtful. Sometimes it’s the details that are someone else’s life. Words mean things. People can and will use them as carelessly as you, and I, and your haters do, but that doesn’t detract from their meaning.
At the end I asked them to pop the balloons. Dude! It was like giving them the keys to the candy store. Once all the ballons were popped, I had them play the one and only game I had for them—pick up all the popped balloons, put them in the trash and you win a bag full of candy! And a noisemaker! I was the most popular mom in the nighborhood! At least as far as the monsters were concerned. The parents force themselves to say hello at the bus stop. Muahahahaha!

I sit down to write my blog about how pissed I was at him when he says he needs help setting everything up. Seriously, it's a fish tank, read the directions. So now another hour of my day off is sucked up because he put water that was too cold in, the filter wasn't hooked up right and I am now freaking that my fifteen dollars worth of fish are going to die in a plastic bag.

1. I’m a bully. There’s no doubt about it, I’m not against bullying even if I’m being bullied at times. I’m a bully for a reason. I don’t just bully for fun.

As I said, when I received the welcome letter, my name was spelt “Pawan Lateshri Chawla”. I called customer service at 121 –which actually tells you you will be charged for calling customer service for help! Anyways, I informed them about the spelling gaffe. Someone said we will inform the concerned people.
One of the biggest peeves within the respect topic is the control, which no one deserves, no matter who you are. One example of this was a scene from the show “Hardcore Pawn” my wife and I watched the other night. This kid, who was probably high school age, was pawning off a piece of jewelry for his girlfriend because he wrecked her car and was paying off tickets for various things. The poor woman looked unhappy to begin with, not the mad kind of unhappy, but the nervous unhappy. He walks in with her, kind of authoritatively and explains his story to the pawn broker. The broker says the asking the kid gave him of the jewelry was unreasonable and offered a different price. The women put her input in and her boyfriend says “you need to shut up and let men handle this.” The broker looked shocked and was wondering why he said that. The kid replies to her again, “Just get behind me and shut up.” That right there, I would tell the kid to get out of my shop and never return. That kind of disrespect is completely uncalled for and drives me absolutely nuts. What made it worse was when he referred to her as his property when he said “I can talk to my property how I want; you would talk to your property that way wouldn’t you?” The key word there was “Property.”

Bayer became part of IG Farben, the conglomerate of German chemical industries that formed the financial heart of the Nazi regime. After World War II, the Allies split apart IG Farben, and Bayer again emerged as an individual company. Its purchase of Miles Laboratories in 1978 gave it a product line including Alka-Seltzer and Flintstones and One-A-Day Vitamins. In 1994, Bayer bought Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter business, gaining back rights to the Bayer name and logo and allowing the company once again to profit from American sales of its most famous product
In one of his recent emails to me he explained why he felt the way he did and I thought it was worthy of a post. What you see below is almost exactly what he wrote to me and I have only taken out some of the personal stuff. It in no way detracts from the main theme.

But, then, I mentioned mixed emotions earlier, didn’t I? Well, before some sweet soul cues the violin music, perhaps I should lighten up and come clean on what Mr. Harvey would call “the rest of the story.” It so happens that while the 8th of May will find me miles from home, it’ll also find me in Savannah, Georgia where I’ve secured myself a little reservation at that famous establishment belonging to Mrs. Paula Deen, the Queen of Southern Cooking. Indeed, y’all, I’ll be suffering for Jesus at The Lady and Sons. I know. It’s a dirty job, but someone has to do it.

Some of you may or may not think about these things, but I know that I am someone who does put some thought into buying a handbag. It may be silly to some of you but how I see it is that, if you buy a purse or handbag (whatever you like to call it) you would like to at least wear it for a while.

We ate one of the little cakes for dessert the first day and the next morning for breakfast - plain and unglazed. It had a lovely soft somewhat refined crumb. Grating the apple meant that there were no obvious pieces of apple detectable in the cake. Rather the apple shreds along with the apple butter contributed to the pervasive apple flavor of the cake. It reminded me very much of a very good banana cake, except with the taste of apple where the banana would be. If that makes any sense. I'm glad I omitted the raisins but the nuts added a nice crunch. The cake was quite sweet so I'm also glad that I cut the sugar. My husband asked for seconds, so we know he loved it!
In November the tot already went to ‘creche’ for three familiarization days and even though he was happy when the three days were over, he was actually looking forward to go again. And on Sunday he told me ‘Mommy, you know, when you leave me there, I’m just gonna cry a little bit. I’m a big boy now, I’m not a baby, so I’ll stop.’
To be fair, I was right based on my first impressions – it is hella awesome. It’s not just one of the coolest sci-fi settings ever published, containing five of the most well-crafted alien species you’ll ever see and a fantastically strong premise (“what if the Federation lost a huge war and so had to hire Han Solo and Mal Reynolds to police deep space in the aftermath”) it also has some great depth of detail and infrastructure to that, all the things that aren’t really setting but aren’t really system (or core system) but make a game unique and strong, like a fantastically detailed exploration of the intricacies of the justice system and a simple but detailed guide to making planets and some awesome cyberware and a huge list of ship stats and what might be (haven’t plummed it in detail yet) the best ship-to-ship combat system ever written…
This new boy, dubbed Malibu (cuz he lives in Malibu), is super cute, has a very attractive body, and has a really nice personality. He's very laid back. He's also very smart and motivated. And I can tell he's a really sweet and kind person. We met on OKCupid. He actually messaged me first. And I must say that the guys that usually message me, I'm not interested in. So when I got a message from this attractive guy that I seemed to have lots in common with, I was rather surprised and excited.

6. Goodie Mob – “Fight To Win” OK, where did these guys get their costumes – from Madonna’s halftime show this past Super Bowl or from The Black Eyed Peas halftime show from the Super Bowl the year before? Also, it’s clear that any group dynamic this group once had has been obliterated by Cee-Lo’s individual star power. The other guys in the barely got any mic time. I expected to hear some solid Southern hip-hop that had Cee-Lo’s voice as one part of the appeal. The beatless, indulgent classic rock arrangement felt like so much wankery from the Lady Killer. Hopefully this isn’t indicative of future material these guys come out with.
Honestly, I didn't write the post to get their attention. I wrote the post because I write about my adventures with beer. I'm sure fellow beer fans in my area frequent Total Wine. So I wanted to share my experience.

To those from home who've inquired how we're holding up and queried just what to think of all this, all I can say is we're doing fine and just as confused about the politics as you are. Does the right to strike trump all? Will public opinion shift if services are still at a standstill when the school holidays begin Saturday? Your guess is as good as mine.
We have known people who foster animals from rescues. However, when some of these animals are placed into the foster home, there is nothing but trouble. The aggression toward other animals already in the home is extremely dangerous. Then comes the guarding of the food. When you take the rescue animal/s outside to do their business, the family pet is harassed and snarled at. What do you do when that rescue animal takes it one step further and attacks your dog? Who do you blame when the foster dog snaps at your child? I do understand that there is the hierarchy to be determined here but when is it time to say “there is nothing you can do for this animal”? Do you continue to bounce it from one foster home to another? Is there something in place in that rescue that has these dogs watched before they are sent to a foster home? Should there be?
We went shopping for more plants this morning and after walking around for a good hour, walked out with quite a few.

* I waited impatiently for more information in the 2002 biography by Roger Lewis. Alas, Lewis had fallen out of love with his subject and the biography informs the reader more about its writer than Burgess. Fortunately, Andrew Biswell was writing another biography, The Real Life of Anthony Burgess (2005). Biswell made the effort to investigate Burgess in Aylestone and Leicester, as you might hope of a University of Leicester graduate, but he should have spent more time in the Black Horse.

Think about what an epic story like The Lord of the Rings would be like if there were no possibility of failure. Frodo’s trip to Rivendell is reduced to the equivalent of a lazy walk in the park. The trip to the Black Gate is a little more strenuous (maybe Sam stubs a toe). Yes, the gate is locked but there’s a secret door (along with a pretty good sized spider…no problems there) and Frodo does, in fact, simply walk into Mordor. He strolls up to the door of Orodruin (maybe he’s starting to breathe a little heavily, but he hasn’t broken a sweat or anything) with Sam and, with a flick of his thumb, flips the One Ring into the fire. High-Fives all around. Quest completed, time to head back to the Prancing Pony for a beer.
The general idea behind Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is that people suffer emotionally as a result of certain logical fallacies. That is to say, we think in ways that don't make sense. But by identifying and combating those destructive patterns of thinking, we can minimize their negative impact on our psyche. Mental health professionals call these kinds of thoughts "Cognitive Distortions," and they classify them in various ways. Below, I've listed some of the more common Cognitive Distortions, defined them as best I can, and given examples of how they affect my own thinking.

In John 20:30-31 we read; And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book, but these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. So we’re told that there is much more to know about Jesus but we’ve been told just enough to fall completely in love with Him and believe that He is who He claimed to be…the very Son of God. The Giver of Life.
The Digital Marketing lecture on a Tuesday night is always very interesting. However, some gloom had to be added to it. I mean, it couldn’t just be 100% edutainment! So, they guy has decided that everybody should do, and present, an eight minute discussion on any topic relating to digital marketing. I had high hopes of dodging that particular task. Bouts of hiding under tables, leaving for a loo break at opportune moments and feigning illness. This last one came in the form of fainting, broken hearts and sanity issues. Now, that bullet has caught up with me, and I have to stand up there and do it. I looked at mentor/ lecturer and tartly said “That was a nasty trick, Andrew!” He laughed. He thought I was joking. Aha, I thought, “we’ll see who has the last laugh.” On consideration of that point I realised I could not, and never could hope to, come away from the task with minimal work and my pride still intact. Hmph.

Dear Mr. Mixed Signals,
A text arrived from her saying that she would buy her own perscriptions with John. I will check on her tomorrow to see if her fever went up. The Dr. said it might. I wonder if she will sell her antibiotics as well or just the narcotics. Once again, when faced with dire medical consequences she goes for the highest high she get. The suboxone and clonoprin would have calmed her and helped her get by. Getting by and or regaining her health is not her priority.
Enforcement of the barmaid ordinance didn't begin until 1961. Dozens of women were arrested and hundreds lost their jobs. Early attempts to sue the city on behalf of female bartenders were unsuccessful. It was only in 1968, in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, that a federal lawsuit began to gain traction.

Let's talk cost. A 52-mile round trip commute translates to about 250 miles a week and over 1000 miles a month. Divide that by the 33 miles to the gallon I get with my Scion (still not as good as the 41 mpg with my beloved Saturn) and I'm saving over 30 gallons of gas--or about $120--per month. Not to mention the wear and tear of my car.

Just then a rollercoaster car with two guards comes up behind Jonah and he dives over the side just as the car slams into the wrecked cycle and chopper. The whole shooting match explodes as Jonah climbs down the side of the coaster track.

I think sometimes people feel nervous about talking candidly about motherhood and their own scheduling choices, and I understand that. Parenthood is emotionally ridden, because everyone cares so much about their babies—so sometimes it can seems as if, when another mom makes a different decision from you, you are at odds. Differences in parenting choices can make people defensive. But, really, making various parenting decisions is like apples and oranges. We have to remember that there are 824,739,894,536 ways to be incredible, loving parents, so we should all support each other and our lucky babies.
However, they were working “at a residential house on Staten Island that was being remodeled by Jones’ company”--and were the only workers at the site. Unpaid, the workers did demolition, “removed debris, laid cinderblock walls to support the upper floor, poured cement floors, framed the rooms, installed plumbing, rewired the house, installed sheetrock, and laid tile for the bathroom.” They didn’t learn much, since they did work that they already knew how to do.

Though it is not yet clear exactly what happened on April 23, 2013 to trigger the momentous events that followed, a broad outline can be offered here with some confidence. At approximately 19:30, a native Danish couple were taking a stroll at the edge of one of the ex-Autonomous Cultural Zones in Copenhagen when they were approached by a group of four or five young Muslim men. The men insisted that the Danish girl should cover her head or leave the area. She refused, leading to a violent altercation between her companion and the men, which resulted in him being knocked unconsciousness with a fractured skull. The girl herself was dragged off into a nearby alley and gang raped, after which the Muslim men left. Still in shock, the girl called her brother, who then made two phone calls. The first was to the ambulance service, as both the girl and her boyfriend were in urgent need of medical attention. The second was to the leader of a small Copenhagen militia of which he himself was a member.

I should plant a cover crop, but I never get around to it.

We know I'm also a sucker for a soft aqua. I think the color palette would be relaxing and soothing.

To all writers: when you have to give up an idea - if it wasn't working, didn't get published, whatever - it's not wasted. One day, you might see how to write it entirely differently, and better. If not, the seed can lie dormant for as long as it's needed, and when the right time comes you will find a way to grow it. Or if you don't, it will still strengthen you. So, never view an idea as wasted.
Although the contractions had slowed down, they did get stronger.

The Flynn side of the family arrived after a painfully slow drive through a snowy mountain pass, and everyone fell asleep. At 5:00 am I was awake and ready to get going, but I figured I had several hours ahead of me and didn’t feel the need to wake anyone. I walked the halls for about an hour by myself, pausing to lean on the walls when I had contractions. Then I decided I might as well take the shower I’d wanted before I left home. Again, I didn’t wake anyone. I kinda figured the shower would do that, but they were all tired and slept through it. But then I was standing there naked in the bathroom and realized I didn’t know where my clothes were, so I yelled out the door for Steve to get up. He didn’t hear me, but Angie did, and she woke him up enough for him to find my clothes. They were all rather surprised to hear that I’d been up and about for awhile.
The scars of the 20 year conflict are everywhere in northern Uganda. I walked through internally displaced person (IDP) camps. I smelled, I listened, I saw, I touched, I tasted. I experienced Uganda. I saw people whose lives had been radically changed. I placed my hands on a woman whose lips had been cut off by the LRA. I walked with children whose parents had been killed. I sat on the foundation of a hut burned down by the LRA. I talked with people whose relatives had been abducted. I walked over land guarded by the UPDF. The landscape, the people, and the country itself has an immense burden to deal with.
I want to feel the way I felt on that trip, at 3 a.m., to go see him. When things were exciting, new, not confusing. When we were just two people who really wanted to see each other. I was not a love Indian giver, and I was falling in love – in my own time, at my own pace. No pressure. Here’s hoping that spending some time together this weekend will get me, get us, back there.

When it comes to different ethnic groups otherwise rational people become sentimental and weak. It’s like a woman on seeing a baby or a child talking to its pet.

The wheaten bread was brought in immense baskets, and as to drink, there was assuredly no scarcity of that, for the Superior and the Saltmaster had each given a mighty cask of beer. Both of these monstrous barrels lay on wooden stands under an ancient oak. The boys and the Saltmaster's men drew from the cask which he had given, while that of the Superior was served by the brother butler and a number of us younger monks. In honor of Saint Franciscus I must say that the clerical barrel was of vastly greater size than that of the Saltmaster...

Well, that picture doesn’t really relate to what I’m seeing, nor does the name “cherry sensation™.” Because I’m silly this way I pull out the iPad and do a little research. Everything I find for Cordyline austalis “cherry sensation™”points to bright reddish pink leaves, like on the tag. I can’t find a single photo that looks like the plants in front of me.

And after those 45 minutes of waiting, I order a beer, which takes approximately (with absolutely no exaggeration involved here) 15 minutes for her to bring. Fifteen minutes! What is so complicated about filling a glass from a tap that it takes an hour from after sitting down before I am able to enjoy my Friday night cocktail?! As the beer arrives, I decide to order food as well, though I fear it would take at least one-and-a-half hours before I even see it. Surprisingly, it only takes about 20 minutes, but the Chicken Tikka Masala that I ordered was perfection. Never has Indian food tasted so good, which is surprising on many levels here: 1) the Germans know nothing about making ethnic foods because they know nothing about the magical use of herbs and spices, 2) even authentic Indian restaurants I have visited have never measured up to the full-flavoredness of the food that enjoyed on this evening.

Our weather had calmed down alot! No wild storms - just rain every now and again. Other than that, nice days. Then we got hit again! The tornados from the midwest were moving towards us. We were reassured that they would weaken and there was no chance of danger. Suddenly, last Thursday around 10pm, the wind kicked up like nothing I have heard since Hurricane Hugo and there were alerts for our area to take immediate cover! A tornado! I was totally freaked out and grabbed my pocketbook (of all things to save) and told my family that if it carried me away (like Dorothy) I would at least have my ID on me and would not be a missing person! Funny the things that go through your mind. I always thought I would be gathering up my samplers if anything like this ever happened! It lasted about 35 minutes and quit as suddenly as it started. Once again, the storm left plenty of damage all around us. For some reason I can't post any pictures right now but I'm just glad we have power! Now we have Hurricane Season right around the corner!

This is a great cast and there are certainly laughs to be had in the pilot – I especially liked the team trying to figure out ways to stop the VP’s ‘retard’ gaffe getting on the front page: “What if Tom Hanks dies?!” – but I simply need to spend more time with the series. HBO doesn’t give you easy-to-digest comedies; they give you series that take more time to work out. Take the series that occupied this timeslot last week, Eastbound & Down – it was a comedy series I was initially put off by but the more time I put into understanding that world and getting to know those characters the more I got out of it because I better understood what the show was trying to do. This is, of course, rather obvious stuff – certain comedy voices take more time to understand than others – but that’s how I feel about Veep; this is a clever comedy but it’s one that needs more time before I completely give myself over to its way of thinking.

I imagine that many people will say that the BNP are 'right-wing' because of the party's opposition to immigration. Conversely, I would argue that importing unskilled labour to artificially suppress wages is itself fundamentally 'right-wing'. The fact is that politicians have, for years, brazenly stated that 'immigrants do the jobs which Britons are too lazy to do'. The reality is that the wages offered are below the market-clearing equilibrium or, more likely, that the benefit system interferes with the labour market.

Jeffries referenced the circus-like atmosphere that sometimes accompany these hearings, noting that the public officials who testify go back to neighborhoods like Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge.

I went to the dentist today. And no, I haven't been flossing. I could say having things stuck into my mouth by a cute girl is fun, but I would be lying. Flossing may make your gums bleed, but getting them jabbed with their alien prodding devices makes it look like you've been chewing glass. I guess if I did actually floss my gums would be all scarred and bled-out so this wouldn't happen. At least it isn't a week long mouth period like after I got my wisdom teeth out (which I even wrote about while I was still loopy from the pain killers.) I guess the horror stories of what happens when I don't floss aren't strong enough to stop me from forgetting what floss actually is.

However, all polarities are prone to be biased by what I will call peer pressure. Electrons that carry (or spin with a polarity) of what you would call a certain kind of charge – we’ll call it positive – are drawn to those that are negative so that they will null themselves out. They seek each other out to create the null of balance. They seek to be balanced, and if they are not, they are not happy. I use this word only to emphasize the condition of a particle of physics that does not find its balance. Even the unscientific can appreciate this.

Consequently, we learned this weekend that her former reality show, Sarah Palin’s Alaska” may return for a second season following its hiatus during the Queen of Quit’s flirtation with a presidential run last season. This second season would presumably feature more staged vignettes of Sarah and family fishing, hunting, bickering and drilling for oil. It has been rumored that the re-emergence of this particular show followed Palin’s failed attempt to create a spin-off series featuring husband Todd the “First Dude” on the professional snow-machine circuit. Apparently TLC could not be convinced that snowmobile racing is the next NASCAR. Of the renewed series however, a network source told the Hollywood Reporter, “I think it is safe to say her time has passed.”

How has doing a yearlong/daily project affected your life? Before my project was clearly defined, I came across a string of words that stated, "Motivation comes from doing." This clicked with me and I was able to see for myself that by simply "laying it down" I was creating paths to explore that had not been there before. I tend to be a critical perfectionist that enjoys the "gestation" period of a project; dreaming but never fully expressing. I'm learning, through this project, to trust myself and take a leap.

There was a possibility of five games, but our team was eliminated after losing the first two games. I got up to bat a total of four times – got one hit but was out at first base, and struck out the other three times. I played right field both games, which was fine with me because it saw the least action, although several hard grounders came my way, and I actually got them and threw them in. Michael did a lot better than I did, but then, he’s not a silly girl.

I think the problem behind the corruption and inefficiency ay the TM Registry is quite simply a lack of personnel to conduct hearings. The DIPP needs to conduct a scientific study on the number of hours that are required to be spent by each Examiner/Registrar on examining a trademark application and then appoint Examiners/Registrars according to the expected number of trademark filings every year. Even presuming that the DIPP does fill up the sanctioned strength of 122 officials, I still don’t think the numbers will suffice. 400,000 is a huge backload. I’m guessing that at the very least the Trade Mark office will have to quadruple its staff to meet the increasing needs of the Indian economy. More on this later.

In the beginning of the film, a man climbs out of the back of a car and breaks the fourth wall to talk to the viewer about the ‘great’ movie tradition of “no reason,” he calls it. This means the nonsensical things we overlook due to suspension of disbelief in many classic films – why characters don’t go to the bathroom, for example. Apparently, that is his excuse for the rest of this film, which features, again, a psychic killer tire lusting after a woman at a cheap motel. Isn’t there a bit of a divide in magnitude there? Overlooking not seeing a character go to the bathroom is a world away from overlooking a tire that comes to life for absolutely no reason and kills people with psychic powers. Those are very, very different things, and the fallacy of the movie’s argument goes right over its own head, resulting in a rather humorous effect, but not for the reasons the director intended. It’s more funny in spite of itself.

The government’s action around the BP oil geyser is equally negligent and harmful to humans.

Given the media silence on radioactive seawater spreading out from Japan, I’m not so sure.

With all the travelling and staying a little extra for the party, we arrived home just 24 hours before Sukkot would start, and pretty stressed out. Sukkot had kind of fallen off the radar and now it was upon us, with no formal plans. I was worried it might turn out to be kind of a lame chag, but that’s not what happened. Instead, we were able to make it special, although pretty different from what we’re both used to.

“The Pennsylvania State Police surrounded the house, and before they could knock and announce their identity, a person up on the third floor was looking out the window, and they felt their positions were compromised, so they conducted a forced entry into the house,” Moon Township Police Chief Leo McCarthy said. The woman’s father said the family has been living there since February and was confused and startled when police arrived. “She claims that, about a month ago, she switched homes with Mr. Ghafoor,” McCarthy told Channel 4 Action News. ”In other words, I’ll live in your house, you live in my house.” McCarthy said Allegheny County records led police to the home, which he said is still registered to Ghafoor and has not been sold to the woman. He said Ghafoor still had some of his belongings inside, which were seized…

The Coroner asked me if I wanted to see pictures of Rob, he assured me they were not close-ups, but I’d be able to at least see that it was Rob. I thought about it for a few seconds and immediately said no. I didn’t want to remember Rob dead. The Coroner left the room to make a copy of the autopsy report for me and it was then that I realized, this was probably the one and only chance I’d get to actually see a picture to help me have closure, and once he returned, I told him I’d changed my mind and wanted to see them.

The Palm family amateur radio tradition continues.
Before Ichigo dies from his wounds, he is rescued by Kisuke Uruhara who continues to prove that there is far more to this man than meets the eye. Uruhara takes Ichigo back to his shop to tend his wounds (with what I’m going to call magic pills for lack of any explanation as to how they miraculously cured him) and explains to him that if he wants to rescue Rukia, he’ll have to let Uruhara train him (for ten days) before he attempts to enter the Soul Society to save her. Chad and Orihime are also being trained (by talking cat Yoruichi) and though they want Uryu to train alongside them, he refuses, instead opting to open a mysterious box for his own private training. Ichigo goes down to a massive cavern beneath Uruhara’s shop for his training where Uruhara forces his spirit out of its body. Ichigo is no longer a shinigami so he’s just a normal ghost, with a spirit chain connecting him to his body and none of his superhuman powers (or his sword). Ichigo’s first test is to fight the little girl that works at Uruhara’s store, Ururu. Ururu is powerful enough to take on full-fledged shinigami and if she hits Ichigo, it would kill him. Still, during the fight, Ichigo’s survival instincts kick in which allow him to summon back the speed he needs to tap into his spiritual power though he still can’t be a shinigami. Then, Uruhara has his assistant sever Ichigo’s spirit chain. It is is slowly receding back to his chest and when it reaches the end, Ichigo will become a Hollow. That’s how long he has to figure out how to get his shinigami form back.

This summer was not only fun filled with playdates, trips to the zoo, swimming, library story time and crafts, but we reached a few serious milestones. We got rid of pacis in just 3 days. My goal was to have the Lovies "off" the pacis before returning to school in September. So we started very slowly, taking them away first thing in the morning and only be able to have the pacis during nap time and "night, night". Then finally after a few meltdowns, they both decided that pacis were for babies and they were not babies anymore. So we "threw" away and never looked back. Now we only use pacis for baby dolls. I could not believe how easy they let them go, but they did and have not asked for them again.

Eric prides himself on being super liberal, intelligent, and the dude in charge of the campus drug ring. He’s your stereotypical over-privileged wealthy high school student who makes good grades and dabbles into illegal activity because his first world problems have become unbearable and he’ll stop at nothing to be intriguing (if you can’t already tell, I grew up with far too many entitled assholes like this).
It is easy to identify the Jesuits and the Jesuit puppets in the United States Congress, because they are the ones that continually try to get all kinds of laws passed that require exactly the opposite from what the Constitution says. They continually pass laws that restrict the liberty of the citizens of the country. They continually pass laws to regulate every aspect of life in the United States. They continually pass laws that restrict freedom of speech such as the Campaign Finance Reform Act.

First of all, this may have been the best episode of The Office ever!
To disobey God for fear of losing career, reputation or respect is surely to make idols of these things. We cannot say that in our hearts we worship God if our actions betray that we don't. Could we imagine Daniel, Shadrach or Jesus himself bottling out at the last moment on the grounds that the cost of obedience to God was too high?
Make no mistake, Charlie was not that brilliant looking.

This recipe really came about at the last minute when my mom reminded me that she had decided on two days of abstinence from meat during Lent.....not only Friday but Wednesday as well. With chicken broth simmering, and no fish on hand the only quick solution was canned tuna from the pantry. Tuna croquettes came to mind as the perfect protein substitute. I used white albacore canned tuna, which I feel is worth the extra cost. Packed in water, it is chunky, truly meaty and light in flavour. No wonder poor Jessica Simpson was perplexed while eating this "chicken of the sea"; wondering whether she was really eating chicken or fish. ......anyway back to the recipe. Although mom hasn't made these in years, I relied on her basic recipe which calls for garlic, eggs, fine breadcrumbs and lots of Italian parsley. The only thing left was to give the croquettes some colour and extra flavour by adding cherry tomatoes and shallots. Also, instead of frying the croquettes, I sent them into the "no fry zone" using panko breadcrumbs drizzled with a bit of olive oil to give me all the crispiness but none of the saturated fats. Served with a creamy celeriac salad and maple Dijon vinaigrette (again a homage to our maple sugar season), it proved a winner and got my mom's seal of approval.
Let's get started:
I opened the package of butter and it smelled fresh and delicious, almost like a foodie perfume. I knew exactly what I was going to bake with my free butter-- Maple Pecan Shortbread. I originally saw it on Every Last Cookie and thought it was a gorgeous cookie and I wanted to eat them. I also wanted to make them for a special friend of mine, Debby from A Feast For The Eyes. I made these as a thank you gift for showing me around town in San Francisco at the Foodbuzz Fest last month. Thanks Debby!

You may notice that I have a new Halloween themed banner and layout. I love Halloween and all things spooky!!! I have a big interest in ghosts and hauntings and strange things so I've decided that I'm going to share some of them with you guys this month. There will be some ghosts stories and photos, Vampires and witches, Horror Movies, weird Colorado History, and whatever else strikes my fancy. I will of course keep up with all my vintage and outfit posts as well. I hope that you guys enjoy this and feel free to post any cool stories that you may have as well.

Fourth – It’s not about you telling your 200 friends your news, it’s about inspiring them to tell their 200 friends about your latest awesomeness. This is about getting the word out at exponential rates. You tell your 200 friends. Ten of them tell their 200 friends. 7 of them tell their 200 friends, and so on. Think rippling waves when you throw a stone into a pond.
Ultimately, I think that a labor market bailout will have to face up to the task of dealing with the labor market directly rather than compensating for its weaknesses. A strong social insurance system and wage protection system will help, by giving workers more options and a feeling of security. However, there is in the end no alternative to creating a social insurance system for jobs to tighten the labor market for the long-term.
The writers also create the craziest situations for each character. For instance, Phoebe has a twin sister she absolutely loathes, while Joey who is sweet but rather a slow-witted actor sometimes finds himself at the weirdest auditions.

I made an appointment with my friend's doctor and off I went. Her office is in an apartment building which is typical for France. No fancy smancy doctor's office. Hell, there isn't even a nurse or even a secretary that works there. Just the doctor. I sat in the "waiting room" aka the hallway of the apartment building until she called me into her office. Her office resembled something out of the 1960's. I swear. I don't think anything has been updated since then honestly. And "sterile" is probably not a word I'd use to describe anything.
Going into 2011, I was very, very determined to lose a serious amount of weight. There were times when I was not motivated at all, but I stayed determined. I pushed and pushed and pushed. Until early October, when I slammed into a wall.
By the 1970's The Foundry was essentially an abandoned space, housing defunct vehicles and a mountain of debris. In 1980 the Du Val family purchased the property. The family restored and renovated the space to reflect its original industrial character, and began hosting events in 2001.
Bottom line… Do what you love and you will always be successful. If you know where your passion lies, then there is a job for you in that field if you look hard enough. What i always suggest to do if you are having a hard time landing a steady employment in a company or field that you KNOW you love, volunteer or intern for a short time. It may seem like you are working for free initially, but the connections and being on the inside may just make that time the best investment you ever can make because you will finally have access to what you are passionate about, that you can build your future around.
How was the experience of playing with Sigur Rós?
I wanted to try my hand at gunkan-style sushi. Yoshio has made them before, but not me, until tonight. Gunkan is an oval-shaped sushi with a strip of nori (a flat sheet of the dried leaves of a sea plant called laver) on the outside, sushi rice on the inside bottom, and with some garnish on top. Gunkan means “battleship” due to its vague resemblance to an iron battleship. The garnish is usually fish roe, jellyfish, or some other fish. There are a few vegetarian garnishes for gunkan like spinach and nato (fermented soybean) but I wanted a more striking color for mine, to mimic the nice color and texture of fish roe.

Pushing someone to let go before they are ready, allows emotions such as anger to linger and causes us to doubt ourselves and even have regret later on. Going through the process of letting go brings understanding... and ultimately peace with our decisions.

But the Herald Sun also loves dogs, as can be seen on about page five or so, even third day, give or take. There was the article about the labrador fetching beer from the fridge for its owner (they showed a little picture of the dog doing just that), and then there was the snippet they ran about Australia's fattest dog (accompanied by lots of pictures of this fat dog). Fat dogs, as any good tabloid writer will be able to tell you, are even better and cuter than fat kids, because they allow you to use lines like 'canine obesity crisis sweeping this nation', and 'cries for help from Australia's fat dogs'. (Also, have you ever tried to photograph or pat a fat child? It's dangerous. Sometimes they even bite.) The Herald Sun even ran a follow up article on this corpulent canine several months after, talking about his journey back to good health ('before' and 'after' photos featuring prominently).
It will be interesting to see how long I can go without crashing. I am sticking to a list and that is that. I am sure I will find a couple things for me but it is OK, I think I am worth it.

Plus, your hen party only comes around once; we would love to really spoil you.

The modern religious search often begins in disappointment. The rhetoric of religious believing and the reality can be miles apart. There can be very legitimate reasons for this disjunction. The truth claims of many religious groups border on the absurd. Complex dogmatic constructs quickly reveal themselves to be the intellectual fabrications of cultural and psychological forces. Disappointment leads to disbelief.
For any one interested in making 1930s clothing, particularly early 1930s, Dress Cutting -- Instructions and Illustrations for Sewing 26 Vintage 1930s Fashions by Margaret Ralston is a must have. This book offers a very informative look at cutting and creating your own custom sewing patterns shown in well illustrated step-by-step sections. Starting with an exercise in taking your measurements, you learn how to create a basic skirt, blouse, and dress. Once you have a basic well fit pattern, you can adapt it to make a variety of items. I particularly like the sections on pleated and flared skirts. I was a bit disappointed when the book first arrived because it was so small, roughly 5" x 7" and only 71 pages. However, if you order this book don't let the small size discourage you! At first glance some of the sections look a bit challenging so take the time to read the book thoroughly. I'm looking forward to really using this book once I clear my sewing schedule a bit.

The sign on the 3rd door on the left said "prefecture." Thankfully, I didn't have time to process the fact that there's a police office in the OFII building (and that they probably were sending me there to get arrested). There was an L-shaped counter. Two chubby, gigantic-breasted, older women sat at desks behind the counter, facing each other. They were deep into a discussion of the pros and cons of buying clothes with elastic. They greeted me with chubby and friendly Bonjours! And one of them, still discussing spandex, stood up. She kept talking while she opened up a Tupperware container. Her friend laughed. Then she offered her a chocolate and then she turned to me and offered me one. Holy shit! I said no thanks, but in retrospect, I should have taken such a lovely gift.

Talked with my mom yesterday. I am trying real hard not to talk about anything Disney World, but as you all understand, it is damn hard! I don't want to talk cause I don't want to push. I've known since June that them talking this trip with us was iffy. But I'd been hopeful the last couple months. Well...not anymore.
Tonight I decided to go for a walk. I was exhausted from the efforts of a long day and while it would have been easier to curl up in front of the TV for an hour or two, I gave in to the calling from the universe to get outdoors. When I finally stepped outside, it was raining and incredibly dark. I decided that my destination was going to be the public library (when I am feeling out of sorts, a good book often helps to relax me).
I switched lenses a couple of times during our walk, but I think in the end that most photos came from the 70-300mm. Given I only have two lenses, I’m not sure I can call it a ‘favourite’ as yet, but it’s getting a fair amount of use. Once again, I was switching between AF and MF, as AF only really seems to want to lock in on something if it is obvious – I haven’t spent time with the manual to find out if there is a better way to get the camera to reselect the focus point. On my old camera, it would usually work by depressing the shutter button to the halfway point over and over until it found the correct spot, but it doesn’t seem to work so obviously with the 60D. Anyway, you can see from the photo below how it misses just enough to be quite annoying.

But Mullah Krekar isn’t the only foreign terrorist living the high life in Norway.

According to passengers that were onboard the plane at the time, Mrs. Andrawes acted very aggressively towards the passengers and she physically assaulted several of them. But the Norwegian authorities took pity on her and gave her a residence permit. Mrs. Andrawes now lives in Oslo.
My husband was shocked, but no, it was not something my parents ever made for breakfast when I was growing up.

My husband is from northern California, which doesn't scream "biscuits and gravy" to me, but his mom grew up in Kansas, so that's probably where it comes from!

I guess I've been quiet lately because I've been doing a lot of personal thinking. Also a lot of personal filtering....No one, not even Handsome, knows about this blog. I've always liked it that way. I started it as a way to just gush out my real thoughts and feelings, but then I started self-censoring. I was worried people in my real life would find this blog. And then, looking back through my posts, I realized I wasn't saying anonymously what I wanted to say anonymously in the first place. It just all ended up being crap and half hearted.

Not to say certain aspects of the plot are not silly. Pretty much every character bends over backwards to imply whales may be more intelligent than humans, a mantra of the time to make people more sympathetic to them.

Geniuses these critters ain’t.

Today I started the day with waffles (I'm still on a breakfast honeymoon with my new waffle maker) and some serious budget evaluating. I've been pretty lax with my budget lately, with Christmas presents, a new stove, a trip to Chicago (Jay-Z and Kanye!) and a Groupon-induced eyeglasses purchase. So it's time to get back on track. Instead of using Quicken to plot my budget based on what I'd like to spend on each category, I started plotting this year's budget based on what I've actually spent on each category- and then making a few adjustments. I think this will be much more reasonable and set me up for success, rather than failure. And overall for the year, I didn't do so bad.
