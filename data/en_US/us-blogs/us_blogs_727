The children are rescued from their plight by a pitchfork rebellion instigated by Caractacus Potts, a widower whose own offspring are imprisoned in the Baron’s castle. I question whether this is the right message for the children of today. Violent revolutions have a poor track-record in human history, often fomenting a reign of terror in which the masses reminisce nostalgically about the ancien régime. As the children’s ideological mentor, one might have expected Mr Potts, an Englishman, to advocate a more measured approach. The Baron, perhaps, could have been forced to sign a Magna Carta and accept a new position as a constitutional head of state. And storming the castle on the Baron’s birthday was a mean-spirited decision, more befitting embittered proletarians than fun-loving children.
There is some regional variation. For example in Australia, the chase car is judged on how accurately it emulates the drift of the lead car, as opposed to being judged on its own merit, this is only taken into consideration by the judges if the lead car is on the appropriate racing line. Other variations of the tansou/tsuiso and the tansou only method is the multi-car group judging, seen in the Drift Tengoku videos where the four car team is judged in groups.
That about sums up our week. Those of you just now entering spring break, enjoy!
Here's something that I know must be bothering guys out there. Do you know that there are weeds that look just like beautiful, magnificent flowers? I'm serious. Do you know what led me to this brilliant observation? The fact, that for the past month I've been meticulously watering a wide assortment of weeds. Some of these weeds have even reached prodigious heights under my tender, loving, and gentle care. I've even been pulling out weeds from around these weeds.
So what’s the problem? The problem is that you, me, and everybody else in the world only have a limited amount of money we can share, so when we run out some of our favorite artists get missed for no better reason than the fact that they weren’t in our faces at the moment when we had cash.

Hello, hello~ I’m really trying to stay on top of blogging, but its kind of difficult – especially between classes and lesson prep and spending every holiday/weekend with K. or in Seoul.
Regardless, I do the best I can and send the information off into the ether. I'm not hopeful that Microsoft will be quick to respond, but I hope that they'll at least lock down the account while we work out the details.

Dad died of Stage 4 Renal (Kidney) Cancer... and heart failure due to the fluid building up around his heart and lungs. That fluid was more cancer, trying to take over. When they found him, collapsed in the hospital room, they tried to revive him. Three doctors tried CPR. His body had given up the fight... and I am pretty certain his spirit had lost the will to live. His "fight" died with Mom. Sis said that when she and Bro went to go identify his body (uh, really?), that he had a smile on his face... an amazingly happy smile, that they had not seen in months. I think he knew where he was going, and that Mom was waiting there for him.

I heard from many of you who serve from your heart who were really feeling you needed to stop giving so much of yourself and your gifts away for free, not out of greed but because you were feeling depleted and taken advantage of. These feelings surfaced as part of you stepping into greater levels of self-valuing.

Aswad took the best of Jamaican reggae music – its rhythms, instrument sounds, chord structures and harmonies – and gave it a British relevance. Other British reggae acts took a similar course in the late ’70s and early ’80s – Steel Pulse and Linton Kwesi Johnson being memorable examples – but Aswad seemed to break more cultural boundaries, gaining the attention of a wider public. Significant numbers of whites as well as blacks. Perhaps this was because Aswad were perceived as broader in their message and not exclusively a band for the downtrodden, or the victims of racial injustice. But I suspect it was just as much about the compatibility of the music. Aswad had a sweet and soulful reggae sound, which used minor keys, a brass section and multi-part vocal harmonies to seduce the most demanding ear. It was a hard sound to resist – whether or not you were a reggae fan.

Therefore it is necessary for me to write of these things for my own sake and the Gospel’s sake and to enter our defense; not because of the blasphemers, however. They are not good enough to make it worthwhile to say a single word of defense to them, for to them the Gospel must always be a stench and a savor of death unto death, as they have deserved by their willful blasphemy. But I must write in order that innocent consciences may not any longer be deceived by these slandermongers, and made suspicious of me or my doctrine, and may not be deceived into believing that we must not fight against the Turks. I have thought best to publish this little book under the name of your Grace, who are a famous and mighty prince, so that it may be the better received and the more diligently read. Thus, if it came to a discussion of a campaign against the Turks, the princes and lords would readily recall it. I commend your Grace to our merciful God’s grace and favor, that He may keep your Grace against all error and against the craft of the devil, and illumine and strengthen your Grace for a blessed reign.

We're living in some pretty tough and interesting times. Around the world right now, countries are going bankrupt, economies are in turmoil, and rates of hunger and poverty are soaring. You don't have to go very far to find people who don't have enough to eat--it may be your neighbors, coworkers, people you see at church, even people at the grocery store who can't afford to buy all the food that they need. According to recent statistics, about 1 out of every 8 people in the U.S. is either going hungry or doesn't yet know where their next meal will come from. And this person could be you. Or me.
I’d stopped going to the bereavement group for a while, then returned to help support a friend through the worst of her grief, but it’s come full circle and I need the group for me again. I was okay for the first two months after the anniversary of my life mate’s death, but the truth — that he is irrevocably gone — has seeped into the depths of my being, and I am feeling heartbroken. I need to be with those who understand this upsurge in grief. Who don’t mind my tears. Who know that the calendar means nothing when it comes to grief. Who realize that yes, the newly bereft need support, but so do those who are further along.

The base is Chocolate Chip and some blue bazzill, topped with Very Vanilla that I've stamped the crab all over in Memento Desert Sand. Next is another piece of blue, punched with the EK Success Dotted Wave punch and topped with more Vanilla, this time stamped with Ticking Stripe BG stamp in Desert Sand. Around this is some May Arts Mesh (I really need to find some more of this stuff!!), topped with a piece of striped knotted ribbon from which I've hung an anchor charm. My focal image is from Oceanside and has been stamped in Memento Rich Cocoa onto X-press It Blending Card and coloured with Copics (E31, E33, E35, E50). I've cut it out with the matching JustRite Nested Oval Medallion Dies and matted with a piece of Chocolate Chip cut with Labels 18 Nestabilities and all popped up on foam tape. To finish I've stamped the sentiment in Rich Cocoa at the bottom and added a couple of silver pearls to the top corner!

This is one of those times. I recently watched The Baader Meinhof Complex, an award winning film by Uli Edel about the Red Army Faction, a left-wing terrorist group that carved a bloody swathe across Germany in a series of brutal politcally motivated attacks from 1970 to 1998. Watching that movie has made me think a lot. Whilst it made dead certain to me the absolute moral repugnancy of much of their actions, which included bombings, assassinations and sieges, the movement that this extreme and in many cases misguided group sprang out of inspired me.

Even though we eat beef burgers quite a bit, I still enjoy eating a good hearty veggie burger. I'm so lucky to have a husband that's willing to try new things... even if it means trying a veggie burger. To my surprise, he actually loved eating this. He even said that he would be happy eating this on a weekly basis, and I agree. I think the only change I will make next time is to add a chopped jalapeno. We have some growing in our garden, and I'm kicking myself now because I didn't think to add this.

Falconer cannot hide behind hard cases, emotional arguments and imprecise terminology. He has to be specific about what ‘safeguards’ he is proposing and if his proposals are to have any traction at all they must be much better than those which have been repeatedly rejected by British Parliaments.
But now, knowing how gross this rotten stump looks like in my face, I’ve started smiling with my mouth closed, or covering my mouth when I smile. I don’t think I do it out of embarrasment, I just don’t want to gross people out. Maybe it is vanity or something, but it’s not nice. I miss really smiling. Because I tend to smile a lot, even when I’m dying inside.

A question remains what are these superheroes avenging, and also how are they talking to each other, but all that doesn’t mattter. The friendly banters amongst each other is fun. The Avengers represents the perfect fusion of an intelligent, witty script. The movie is action packed with a power punch. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book film, but a story with reason that’s backed up with incredible action and humor. The movie is a comic book fan’s fantasy.Can’t call it THE BEST Superhero movie but surely one of the best and entertaining.

The main benefit of this model of education is that I can capitalize on something which has already piqued their interest instead of trying to generate enthusiasm in them for something which I think is important or interesting. The main challenge of this model is relinquishing control over the immediate direction of learning and the vague feeling of power that goes with that control. It also means that I constantly have to scramble to keep up with them - though I am finding that with practice I can often find a way to make most things about some preferred set of ideas or concepts. It just requires being prepared with a range of ideas and finding which one fits best with the current object of interest.
OK... I am so falling short of my July goal of posting everyday, that I need to do something about it, and I cannot procrastinate any further.
Confession: My experience documented in the previous entry took the wind out of my sails. I need to be stronger than that. It is inevitable that there will be people along my journey who do not have the answers I am looking for. I should be glad to recognize the disconnect so quickly. The irony for me is that even though I was very quick to dismiss the advice – both in my head and on my blog – I was still thrown off.
12:45 GMT: More shooting coming from the same direction, including the “boom-boom-boom” of heavy weapons. I’m wondering if I should revisit my hypothesis of shooting into the air.

The very last night of the cruise... after I ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, AND 2 desserts at dinner, we had the big farewell party. Students had spent the whole week working on secret projects and it was finally time for the design contest. We had some seriously talented people in our midst. Prizes were awarded for Most Intense, Simply Sweet, and Show Favorite after votes were tallied. Then... the picture snapping commenced!! It was seriously like something off the red carpet with a sea of paparazzi flash bulbs going off for about 30 mins straight. I snapped Instagrams with each of the other teachers... Heather, Tracy, Jill, and my favorite lady, Beverly Herman (Heather's Mom). Beverly is an absolute sweetheart and OMG, an amazing instructional illustrator. Her project pattern graphics are nothing short of brilliant. If you have the chance, you must take a class with her!!

If you decide to read "The Heart of a Woman", I recommend starting on page 273, or "Also by Maya Angelou". Here, you will find blurbs to the previous three books which may help you make sense of the present volume. This is not to say that "The Heart of a Woman" cannot be read on its own, but simply that, as is necessarily the case with any story written in parts, the experience is not as rich.

The kingdom of heaven is messy: This isn’t going to go smoothly. God is working to advance His Kingdom in this world, but there are powers of evil and darkness that want the same soul-territory. Right alongside Kingdom will be anti-kingdom. There are people who will swallow up any seed of hope we might plant in another person. ”The world’s worries and the seduction of wealth” choke our devotion like thorns and strong weeds (13:22). Purification and complete rescue won’t come until the end.
Since I was on a kick for the regency romance novels lately I decided to go for one modern day romance. Talk Me Down was the book. The moment I started I wanted to finish to see how it would end and who this stalker was. But Victoria Dahl leaves the reader wanting more and gives a twist that was not seen coming, a good misdirection.

Fringe is renewed! Yaaaay! For 13 episodes only, though it does let the writers wrap up my favourite show on tv. Friday's episode saw a tear or two when they had to close the bridge to the other world. I am constantly amazed and surprised by Fringe, even after 4 years, even when I think the episode is slow, or the story is familiar, there is all the delights of watching variations of our characters in other worlds, and how they are different.

Maybe if she understood how things are, she'd be inclined to give me a bit of leeway. Maybe if she knew how when I control food my powerlessness becomes empowerment, how my aimlessness becomes directed, how my fears are vanquished by aspiration and certainty, maybe then she'd back off some. Maybe if she knew the relief it is to look at your own reflection and for the first time in months not be overwhelmed by disgust, she would empathize.

Offerings for adults include egg & bacon pie, lamp wraps, focaccias, salads, steak sandwich and chilli con carne, plus a specials board for breakfast.
However, even with this mainstream aspect, the social justice movement is still counter-cultural. What’s more counter to American culture than a movement rejecting political boundaries, and striving for just treatment for everyone, regardless of which side of an arbitrary line a human was born? Obviously we can be sedated by the ads into thinking this is just a fad.

To me, parenting is not an art, although there can be a lot of creativity involved, because our children are not lifeless raw materials, waiting to be shaped by our input. Parenting is not a science, although there can be research and experimenting involved, because there are no formulas or equations to follow.
Of course, if the book proved a success, then that second run might well be of 1,000 copies and the subsequent third print run of 400 copies – which would make up the 1,500 copies in three print runs as promised in the contract. Any subsequent orders would – in the fullness of time – be covered by the contract’s statement of ‘subsequent print runs shall usually consist of 500 to 1,000 copies.’
Bulimia is rearing it’s ugly head again. Bite. Chew. Swallow. Stick fingers down throat. Repeat. Then the inbetweens where I fall apart. Can’t eat. Won’t eat. Can’t drink. Won’t drink. I have a cupboard full of medications I’m supposed to swallow down; supplements, things to make my mood not fall to the end of the earth. Things to make me sleep. I swallow the main ones; the anti depressant & the sleeping pills. Everything else seems to expensive to have it come straight back up.
Some of our irises are still flowering...which is long overdue but with the extended summer this year perhaps they have been tricked. Even though they are short lived I find the iris and all her various shades very lovely...So lovely, that I have recently split all of our bulbs in an attempt to border our driveway....Did you know that the iris, if not split every two years, will revert to the classic pale blue/purple shade? This is what I am told happens in Provence and that is why there are so many overgrown clumps of pale blue growing wildly in the countryside....I am aiming for the majority of my blooms to remain white....so splitting I will be and planting I will continue...for the near future...or until I have enough to completely line both sides of our driveway....
I began by forcing myself to drink ensure shakes, they do taste yummy but with a burnt throat it is extremely hard to do but I needed the calories and vitamins so I pushed myself.

Around 725AD a Benedictine monk named Korbinian founded a little chapel on a little hill called Weihenstephan. This means ‘sacred Stephen’ and its significance in this story is really cool and will be revealed shortly. By 1040AD the chapel had graduated to the status of abbey and was granted the right to sell its beer. This was a big deal because the retailing of beer was strictly controlled by the government and it wanted to protect its tax revenue and to ensure that the beer sold was of a good quality.

3. Another good control is to offer the first hour as paid by the company/organization/etc and then change to a cash bar for the remaining hour(s). Or, if it is a casual affair, give your guests drink tickets to use. Agree before hand with the hotel/caterer on the price for each turned in ticket. For example, if the highest price of a drink is $9.00 and the lowest one is $4.00, suggest that the “flat ticket” price be $5.00 to $5.50. Thus you control the bar cost and after the tickets are used, the guests can pay as they go.

In the evening there was range led presentation about the global warning. Though I wasn’t surprised by most of the information he said about the warming, I was surprised about the things that Alaskans do about it. I was under the impression that Alaska would be this very conservative state that denies any mention of global warming. However, being hit one of the hardest by the changes, they seem to be doing a lot more about it that many other more liberal states.

As the police car moved closer, I also noted the sound of a siren, so the two vehicles in the left lane kept moving forward well into the next block with a police car behind them with lights and siren going. They finally pulled over and let by the cop who proceeded to go through the intersection another block later – and there’s a story about this intersection as well. This was several moons ago, but since I’m on the subject – there are three lanes at this intersection: the left one labeled “left turn only”, the middle one with a straight arrow, and the right lane labeled “right turn only.” I was planning to go straight through the intersection and chose the appropriate middle lane. The light had just turned red, so I stopped as trained by parents, driver’s ed, etc. Once stopped (remember the light is red) a truck passed me on the left going straight followed by another passing me on the right and going straight.

We each had a handroll too. I went for a California, and in stark contrast to the Opera Plaza Sushi's version, Moshi Moshi's roll contained whole pieces of crab meat, still shaped like the creature's claw. D's spicy tuna roll couldn't have been further from the Opera Plaza one either. It contained delicious looking, deep red slices of fish. I regretted not having enough room to try one myself.

Right now all I know for certain is that I will be in London at some point between April 9-13, possibly longer. I may be doing one or two conventions in England the weekend before and after, and I might make it up to somewhere in the midlands (Birm, Notts, Leeds?)
He pushed the white door open a few inches, poked his head round the gap. The buzz of the mower still droned from the garden. There was a huge furry black cat curled up in an armchair, but it appeared to be fast asleep, didn’t even raise an ear, let alone move, or question his arrival. He glanced around the room, assessing the possibilities; there was a flat-screen TV in the corner, but little else that could be grabbed and carried.
I wasn't entirely sure what to choose since I've never worn 'real' circle lenses before. I've only used the Johnson&Johnson's Acuvue Define lenses which are dailies.
Terrestrial vertebrates evolved from fish, and their eyes would at first have been similar to those of modern fish: adapted to seeing under water, with a hard, spherical lens solely responsible for focusing incoming light. Moving from the sea to land created an extra point of refraction (at the air/cornea interface), which means that our ancestors probably suffered from blurry, myopic vision for millions of years. In time, though, the refractive ability of the cornea opened new avenues for evolution, and turned the handicap into an advantage. Relieved of some of the burden of refracting incoming light, our lenses were freed up to become softer and less dense, more flexible, capable of changing shape to fine-tune their focal distance. That is why the eyes of some modern terrestrial vertebrates – in particular, predatory birds such as hawks and owls – are probably the finest that ever saw.

What can we do? As in everything else, it comes back to the money. As long as consumers are buying enough Special K (or SlimFast or fill-in-the-blank-weight-loss-product) to keep them in business, companies will continue to produce the products. And advertise to sell them. Because the ads are working. But, the truth is all around us if we'll just pay attention. All the yo-yo and fad diets don't make us healthy, and usually cause more problems than they solve. (If they work at all.) It all comes back to a healthy lifestyle. Exercise and eating real food. Being skinny isn't the ultimate goal. Being healthy is. Overweight people who exercise are healthier than sedentary skinny people. So forget the sugary cereal, eat something truly healthy, quit watching those stupid TV ads and go exercise.

A demon is in pursuit of the blameless Sarah, and has already killed her previous 7 husbands on their wedding night. With the help of the archangel Raphael, Tobias is determined that a similar fate won't befall him. The demon is exorcised and bound by the angel. But Tobias does something really profound, rather than go ahead straight away and consummate the marriage, he and his new wife pray at the end of the bed and then sleep without consummation. Purity is so important when vanquishing demons and making sure they don't return with their mates. The prayer is worth quoting in full:
Today, unceremoniously, after almost 4 years, I stopped being a vegan. My heart literally pounded when I put the first forkful of rice and chicken broth in my mouth. It pounded as I ate every other bite in the rest of the bowl. It pounded 20 minutes after I finished. My body waited in some sort of....pausing? testing? making sure that I was really okay state of being. That I had just finished my first intentional mouthful of liquid chicken parts in approximately 1,200 days. That I was not going to break out in hives. Or puke.
But Jesus loves me, I guess. No, I don’t guess, I know. And I guess on nights like tonight, I just need to pray that I’ll KNOW it.
The only thing worse are when these people are your friends. Oh wait, they are! You know the friends I’m talking about? The people you never really wanted to be friends with because you didn’t like them and then one day you were like “hey, they’re not that bad. They’re actually pretty chill!” but then when you become friends with them, they get all irritating again and you just can’t shake em because you’re too nice of a person? Hate those guys.

Review of the Sony TDG-BR100 3D Glasses
It isn’t proximity to one’s neighbors that makes a community, but rather experiences, commonalities, and sometimes conflicts define communities. Communities are also support networks, and these networks were essential for survival, particularly for working-class families in the early years of the 20th century.

American "liberals" often deny being Leftists and say that they are very different from the Communist rulers of other countries. The only real difference, however, is how much power they have. In America, their power is limited by democracy. To see what they WOULD be like with more power, look at where they ARE already very powerful: in America's educational system -- particularly in the universities and colleges. They show there the same respect for free-speech and political diversity that Stalin did: None. So look to the colleges to see what the whole country would be like if "liberals" had their way. It would be a dictatorship.
Jeanette Allan, Lead OT is “Delighted that Buddy Beat has gained the recognition it deserves and is especially as the award is in main stream arts not mental health! The Buddy Beat model has been highlighted as a good practice example in a report ‘Realising Potential: our Own and Others’ being produced by Scottish Government. The model has also been adopted in Dundee, a city that now hosts its own group now called ‘Drumdee’. Buddy Beat are musicians in their own right, raise awareness by sharing their recovery stories and are an amazing group of people who continue to support new people into the group. Some members are now workshop assistants coming back into Dykebar Hospital to deliver sessions.”

At Cana in Galilee there is shown only one concrete aspect of human need, apparently a small one of little importance (“They have no wine”). But it has a symbolic value: this coming to the aid of human needs means, at the same time, bringing those needs within the radius of Christ’s messianic mission and salvific power. . . . Mary places herself between her Son and mankind in the reality of their wants, needs and sufferings.

Woo Jin points out a purple gift wrapped box which Dae Su opens, finding it contains his own family photo album with many pictures of his daughter, who he realizes is Mi-Do. We see Mi-Do with Mr, Park wearing the angel wings from the beginning. Dae Su, enraged, now attacks the bodyguard who easily throws him back every time. The bodyguard doesn't realize that Dae Su had a pair of scissors in his hand which he had shoved into his ear, leaving him paralyzed and disoriented. Woo Jin shoots his bodyguard to put him down and he falls. Dae Su asks if Mi-Do knows, and Woo Jin tells him he was stupid to leave her with Mr, Park, who wasn't angry about the hand but gladly gave it up for a good amount of money. He also tells Dae Su that he has been secretly raising Mi-Do since she was 4. Woo Jin then arranges for a call so Dae Su can talk to Mi-Do who is with Mr. Park. She tells him that Park has a box there he wants her to open. He pleads with her not to open it. Dae Su then grovels on the ground begging Woo Jin not to tell Mi-Do as she's done nothing wrong. He abandons all dignity, crawling like a dog and barking, even licking Woo Jin's shoes. He ultimately cuts off the tip of his own tongue off, in order to get him to spare Mi-Do. Woo Jin laughs at the display but calls Park and tells him to leave the box closed. He holds a gun to Dae Su's head but takes it away. Dae Su realizes he's dropped the trigger device for his pacemaker and grabs it as Woo Jin walks to the elevator to leave him. Dae Su presses the trigger but rather than kill Woo Jin it plays audio of he and Mi-Do having sex. Before the elevator doors close, he tells Dae Su "Believe it or not, my sister and I really loved each other. Can you two do the same?" Dae Su is left there to listen. In the elevator, Woo Jin remembers the day Soo Ah died. In the memory he struggles to hold her arm, as she hangs from the bridge. She begs him to let go and he finally does, watching her fall. In present time, Woo-Jin shoots himself in the head.

It’s good that Mrs Brick appears to have an outstanding amount of self-confidence, it’s something that a lot of woman (myself included) are lacking in.

Would it be beneficial for Paul to remind those Jews what he was like in his unsaved state? Or would it not be more profitable to tell them how they, too, might have the resurrected life in Christ Jesus? He was God’s apostle in his saved state not as a lost sinner. He was to preach the Word, according to 2 Timothy 4:2; not his own experiences, especially as an enemy of the Lord.

She had moved on to a game of virtual Chess on her computer. As I made to leave, I caught sight of my reflection in the black mirror of my phone. Even in black and white, the extent of my reddening was evident. Judy gasped in knowing. I stood, lotion-less, horrified at the entire thing. Judy turned and tapped at the keys of her computer briefly, before roaring in victory.
In the past three years, running has become our obsession, our solace, our exercise and our joy. We’ve had our ups and downs. Family crisis, persistent injuries, work/school schedules and stress; running has gotten us through it all. We do not know how to take up an athletic endeavor without the other, and I am glad. I may never have discovered this passion on my own without her encouragement. Thanks sis.
Well, there's no way to sugar coat this so I won't. My PET scan revealed spread of disease. That's the doctor's nice way of saying-spread of the cancer-to my liver, many lymph nodes, part of my pelvic bones and parts of my spine. This classifies the cancer as stage 4. Now if you are offended by swearing jump down to the next paragraph or better yet skip this post all together because I need to get Brooklyn right now. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME, PEOPLE? This is me. Elisa. I don't get cancer much less the really bad, terribly serious kind of cancer. It just doesn't suit me. Heart disease. I could see that in my future with all my emotions running wild, but cancer? Or diabetes. That's a likely disease for me. I have PCOS and it's in my family. But CANCER? No way. Give me a break. This is fucking ridiculous. Fuck, shit, mother-fucking, what the fuck? AHHHHHHHHHH.

I'm a chronic multi-tasker and I don't mean that in a good way. In trying to do everything, it's hard to do anything really well. It also leaves me feeling like every room in our house is unfinished, whereas focusing on one room or one project at a time would give me a place to escape to when the rest of the house is feeling particularly chaotic. So this year I'm going to try to focus on one room at a time, one project at a time.

Things have definitely started seeing a change of pace around the home front since the news of the third little amigo being on its way. I can't find much energy to do most things, so priorities have changed. I find myself spending more time focusing on the boys and just enjoying them. I don't want to spend my whole pregnancy thinking of things that need to be done OR being overwhelmed by how much life is going to change by adding another little being that needs all of my attention. I want to remember this time with just the three of us. I want to really and truly enjoy the beginning of the preschool age and the end of the baby stages. Every day seems to bring new accomplishments or discoveries. I don't want to lose those little celebrations in exhaustion.
So neo-liberalism suffers from the huge handicap that it is a highly intellectual body of ideas that requires considerable study and knowledge of economics -- something that Leftists normally seem to avoid like the plague -- in order to understand it fully. It originated with an economist (Smith), it could even be seen as the practical application of modern economics and some of its most prominent proponents have won Nobel prizes for economics (Friedman, Hayek etc.). It is certainly much harder to explain and communicate to laymen than are such simple ideas as "all men are equal" or "get the government to pass a law". And the heroes and villains of neo-liberalism do not suit the Leftist either. The neo-liberal hero (the business entrepreneur) normally has to work long and hard to achieve his status. Storming the Winter Palace (as the Bolsheviks did in October, 1917) or vandalizing Seattle (as the anti-globalization protesters did in December, 1999) are heaps quicker, simpler and easier. And the neo-liberal villain is government! The solitary proposal that Leftists have for solving social ills is snatched away from under them! No wonder Leftists do not like neo-liberalism!
“There was also a crackdown by the police, there were threats from Perkasa and Umno Youth, a court order forbidding a bunch of leaders from entering KL, news of planted parangs at SOGO and Pertama Complex (probably planted by you know who to scare away protestors), pre-arrests and raids on premises, and so on. This time there is none of those. Hishamuddin even said “Bersih is not a security threat”. What a change from last time.”

- Questioning doctor's orders when they don't seem reasonable, though 6 units of insulin (what kind of insulin? Though that may be a bit too picky) isn't crazy. And is definitely, definitely the nurses job. "Just following orders" isn't a defense against getting your license yanked for violating the Nurse Practice Act. The questioning the order scene was decent, but we really didn't need that nurses-are-just-failed-docs bit. I love being a nurse and would never want to be a doctor. Two quite distinct jobs not on a continuum (damn you ER's Abby Lockhart). Also, no recapping your needles! You're a suck-o nurse for that. Lastly, insulin overdose doesn't cause shockable heart arrhythmias. And if you were that worried, check his blood glucose as a follow-up, if you see it drop below normal levels, give the patient some orange juice. That's good nursing care. I'm not impressed with your work.

For those that didn’t hear about this controversial bit of legislation. It would have prohibited anyone under the age of 16 from working in agriculture. This included the family farm. Young people across the country would have also not been able to engage in anything related to agriculture that could be deemed as “labor”. This could have included many projects for 4H and FFA, such as livestock and horticulture. Millions of dollars in money and scholarships related to these projects are awarded across the United States. Not being able to participate in this type of activity until the age of 16 would have devastated that aspect of the industry and hindered many from attaining a higher education.

She freaking skips. She skips into her class room with a smile. This happens most mornings, I’m told. She’s a pleasure to have in class. When I have to visit the school for one reason or other and I happen to see her in the hallways she’s always looking happy. She used to get so distressed at seeing me at school whether it was planned or not that I’d have to take her home with me. She fusses a bit now, asks if she’s supposed to come with me, but if I say no there aren’t tantrums. Of course if I do have to pick her up for an appointment she’s ecstatic to leave and that transition is nearly seamless except for the fact that it’s an appointment and not coming directly home. Unless we’re going to her Auntie Tracy’s house. Any time we go there it’s a perfectly seamless transition. Every single time, because her best friend Ella is there.

The discussions for this program have been wonderful. I love hearing everyone’s thoughts and ideas. This is the most positive part of this program, and it is encouraging to see families bonding and sharing in the library and literature experience. The one challenge that we may be facing is attendance. At our last session, two of the families were missing, but, since we do keep tabs with one another on edmodo, I’m hoping that this was just a fluke. Our next session is tonight, and I’ll see how attendance holds up.

I also feel with Entanglements a lot of the things people said about the record...they either said it out right or suggested that they didn’t have time with the thing, because it is a pretty dense record with it being so short.

I feel like part of the deal was the album seeming less and less relevant as also part of our consideration. I’m not as enthralled with a new record as often as I use to. I don’t feel like it is a real tragedy that the album format is kind of going away.
On our last day, we got cocky and climbed out to some huge rocks as the tide was coming in. (The tide is pretty important here, since it can trap you if you're caught out during high tide.) The formation of these rocks created a blowhole that forced the waves 30-feet in the air! One of which nailed me and the camera. Oops, no more pictures for awhile.

Humility is the key to gracious living. When I feel grumbly or discontent I need to ask myself why I feel that way...pride is usually the answer and stands in the way of gracious living. Now picture if you will someone who is acting graciously....the picture of beauty and strength is undeniable.

I was in a conversation, or battle, with this professing Christan named Wilson over at Triablogue and I thought it would be a good post because of the subject and points that was made about alcohol. This guy that I was talking to is not the point here, even though his ego needed a check, the point was what was said about the consumption of Alcohol.
These are cards from "Row 2" of the three available rows. Whatever. Yet, there are two different backs. One back is listed as Showdown and one as Showtime. I can't tell you how glad I am that I was not collecting in 1999. I would have been committed by now.
In addition to requiring employers to be transparent regarding pay rates, the new legislation officially now makes it “legal to promote a woman or a black person over a white man if they are equally able”, the same would apply when considering two “equally able” candidates for a new position, where one is a white man and the other is either a woman or a non white person.Officially the intention is to encourage equality, however, given the woolly manner in which the legislation is drafted, the real intention is clearly to encourage employers to employ woman or black people instead of white males.
Today, February 16, Premio Lo Nuestro – the Latin Music Awards, is being viewed by millions of television viewers around the world including the English-speaking audience (closed captioning in English).

Much smoke over at on old post of mine called ‘Milbank in the Monstrosity of Christ‘. A certain Alasdair Maclagan is making some rather large claims for the way radical orthodoxy, blue labour and red toryism are about to change the world – well, at least England, which is certainly not the same thing, although some seem to think so. Even moles within the good old conservatives, which will soon rule that sodden patch of ground, are in on the act – of destroying liberalism and replacing it with the long-awaited golden age. Add the pope and we’re really into something, it seems. However, when I clicked on the edit function in the WordPress thingy I noticed something strange. You see, to make a comment on WordPress (for those of you not in the know), you need to add a name and an email address. And the address connected to the name of Alasdair Maclagan is:
It is quiet clear: A society that does not punish its criminals creates more crime for itself. And everyone suffers the consequences — including the coddling judges. For they too, have children, grandchildren, wives and siblings who live in this land. Needed above all are the policies which will make the determinations that are appropriate to protect the people, rather than exterminate them.

From the second chart, we see how every category of income has increased, with sales, fees and charges, plus "other income" increasing to match that of Council Tax.

Not many lifetime marriages are tested on the "in sickness" vows like Billy and Vanessa have been ever since Vanessa was diagnosed with breast cancer nine months after they said "I do."

That vision carried over in interviews with the likes of Isabella Rossellini, Lisa Fonssagrives-Penn (pictured, above), Lillian Bassman, and Lola Schnabel, and rich photo essays to go with them. Here, Style.com has the exclusive first look at a few of the editorials, including Fonssagrives-Penn’s (with photos by her husband, Irving, selected by their son, Tom Penn) and Bassman’s—both are women that drew Persson’s attention for their glamour and sophistication.

I am nothing if not a treasure hunter. I love to wake up early on a Saturday morning and head to the flea market with nothing in particular in mind just to see what I might find. But sometimes you actually are looking for that something. Maybe you need to finish off styling some bookshelves. Or you need that one, special serving piece for a party. Or just the right lamp for an end table.
In the center of the grounds was a round stage with the beach behind it. There were seating areas around 2/3rds of the stage where people could sit on mats. Tony saw them and said, “I'm glad we're not sitting there”. I told him I requested conventional seating (chair/table) rather than traditional mat seating. His knees thanked me. The regular tables fanned out from the stage and ours was on the first row closest to the mat seats. Nothing obstructed our view of the evening’s performance.
And by you, we don’t beggarly the accepted hero in these situations, Mario; rather, we beggarly a accomplished blend of Mini-Marios broadcast about the game’s eight worlds. Advance of the Minis follows a agnate anatomy to the aboriginal game, with altered stages in anniversary world, as able-bodied as a bang-up date beyond you action Donkey Kong. However, the stages don’t play abundant like they did in the GBA game. Here, the gameplay takes a camber far added affiliated to something actuate in the Lemmings series. Anniversary date has a bulk of deactivated Mini-Marios sitting in one atom or another. To actuate them, you artlessly draft one with the stylus, and it will actuate walking in whatever administration it’s facing. You can about-face it by annexation the stylus in the adverse direction, achieve it jump by annexation upward, and stop it by borer on the Mini again. The ultimate appetite is to get all the Minis in a date to a aperture that’s usually abandoned by a alternation of traps, pitfalls, enemies, jump pads, adaptable walls, and the like.
Traffic was stop and go, up to 2nd gear maximum. I saw the cruiser behind me, but I had no concerns. The van in front of me drifted to the left, and I followed suit, trying to see the tail lights of the car 2 or 3 in front of me. Something I've learned about early braking. When the cruiser activated it's lights and motioned me to pull over, I thought I might have a light out or something similar. No way I could have been speeding.

So you might think then that you must attend only to the thoughts of your mind. Billions of dollars and hours have been spent trying to change our belief about ourselves. We read books, us affirmations, vision boards, chants and videos. We go to seminars, and workshops, psychologists and support groups. We might have some progress, however, not enough progress to affirm that we indeed are solidly changing our beliefs. Why, after we have tried so many things to change our beliefs, does it seem like we are hitting a brick wall every time.
My two boys are on spring break and we have been trying to keep busy. Today is a rainy and cloudy day, so we don't have anything exciting planned. I think we might pop in a movie and enjoy some popcorn! Have a super day and thanks for stopping by!
My pink cruiser stood out like a sore thumb – It was clumsy to ride but the thrill it gave me out weighed any difficulty I might of experienced. The odd car would whizz by glimpsing life in the valley at top speed. We certainly felt as if we had the better deal with a warm breeze in the air and our spokes turning at a gentle pace on the smooth tarmac.
Eventually the truck pisses off down the road and they wonder what to do before heading off in the same direction the truck went in. Down the road the truck is stopped halfway across the road forcing them to swerve to avoid it and going off the road and stopping and then they sit in the car and bicker and do even more nothing at all.The truck drives off down the road

Anyways, it brought me back to thinking how musicians and bands need to consider those that are performing even if it isn’t them. As a music consultant, I understand that a band may need to deal with loading in and other issues that may keep them from watching a performance, but when the work is done, if you can show that respect, give the attention to that band on stage, it can not only show yourself as respectful but also get that artist to do the same.

Weston had served less than four years in prison for a 1984 conviction for starving to death a man, 25, she kept trapped in her Philadelphia apartment. She was arrested in October with her daughter and husband after the landlord of a Tacony apartment house found four intellectually handicapped people locked in the building’s cellar.
Or did this Bigfoot really exist? In 2002, Philip Morris, owner of Morris Costume Company in Charlotte, NC admitted to media sources that the creature seen in the film was actually a man dressed in a modified gorilla suit that Morris had sold to Patterson via mail order. The story was taken up by author Greg Long in his book The Making of Bigfoot: The Inside Story. Philip Morris had told the story many times since the 1980s but never made a big deal out of it. He had mentioned the story in a radio interview and it caught the attention of the media, eventually reaching Greg Long. Since then, Philip Morris's account has appeared in print and on television numerous times.

I am such a fan of this cotton top's style: I like the long sleeves, the tiered ruffles, and buttoned cuffs. A word of warning, though, it is extremely lightweight, thin, and prone to wrinkles. I'm not sure how it'll hold up after a few washes and wears, but I have faith in this ruffly top. :)
Other suggestions, don’t let them watch horror movies with you, don’t discuss how you’re sure aliens DO abduct people in the night, and don’t chase the two-year old around the house with a two-foot tall replica of the Cloverfield Monster. Like most insanely fun things, you will pay for it.

But making our schools healthier isn’t just about what happens in the kitchen. As Norah said, it’s also about what kids learn in the classroom. And that’s why we’re also encouraging you to do things like put on cooking demonstrations; teach kids how to prepare meals at home. You can help start a cooking club, work with the teacher to integrate food into the lesson plan, like they’ve done at Murch, or help students plant a garden, if possible. All that stuff is a part of it. It’s not just about the work in the kitchen.
So, things are good, despite the worry that I can't talk about... some nice time with friends, romance blossoming, which is lovely actually, and this gorgeous warm weather is such a treat. I feel as if I come alive in the spring, a cliche, I know, but these light nights, the warmth, everything growing, it gives me a real boost.
There is more than just one theory to how the moon was formed. The most common and accepted is that another, large object, roughly the size of Mars (named Thea), impacted the Earth before it completely formed, swiping part of Earth off as well as obliterating itself and later, due to Earth’s gravity, formed as Earth’s very own satellite. It’s not set in stone that this is how this happened, after all we were not there when it happened, approximately 4.5 billion years ago. We may never know how our celestial companion came to be; however, there is no doubting her influence on our planet.

I know I said that you'll become more awesome by reading my blog. Which is true. But chances are you'll become a whole a lot dumber too. I would apologize for that but I have bigger things to figure out. Like why isn't there peace in the Middle East? I mean, I have a vague idea of why, but I don't really know why. I know I could learn why by watching the news or reading a newspaper.
What is yet more frightening is that we are doing with the reading of the Word the same that we are doing in the hearing. Has it not become for us what Ezekiel’s spoken words became for his generation, “a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice” (33:32)—and we do them not? We do not receive the word of God as something that would affect our conduct and our relationships.
The image is one of Stampavie's Sarah Kay stamps, Sofia Wishes, oh my goodness I absolutely love Sarah Kay stamps, so very beautiful and, guess what........ I've coloured her with distress inks.... I know another medium. Some say you should stick to one but wouldn't that be boring, lol. I was lucky enough to win $100 at 7 Kids College recently so I topped up on some distress reinkers and have put them to good use. I hope you like her, I did her face a little too dark but as it was the last part of the image I coloured I wasn't going to start again. You learn don't you.

Yet. What if the build-out is truly ill-conceived? If Party leaders (central and provincial) are so close to the elites who run the state-owned conglomerates, they’ve got hands in eachother’s pockets. If the governing elite simply hired the enterprise-running elite — the state owns the biggest engineering firms, cement manufacturers, transport and energy conglomerates. If they’re investing the nation’s wealth not in education or healthcare, but roads to nowhere, tunnels through mountains, out of nepotism, favoritism, intra-elite self-dealing?
Fail Five: How many appetizers did you order? I'll forget to order yours. About 30 minutes passed, and the table was presented with two of the three appetizers - the steamed artichokes (2 whole) and the leek & potato soup. The artichokes were shared around the table as we waited. We worked on our second basket of bread with the over salted olive oil. After another 20 minutes, we inquired about the escargot that I had ordered for the table. The waitress insisted that they were coming out. Instead of going to the kitchen to get them, she went to the computer to place the order for them.
Some of my favorite people went to Rice Paper for some pho and fun. Since I already talked about this place I wanted to give an update. The pho was so good and I definitely recommend the Spider roll!

Despite economic conditions not conducive to sales of high-end, high-cost supercars Ferrari is known to be him? Even if Tom Selleck's character sported a fairly wild haircut and a driving position complicated by having the enzo ferrari photos and clutch pedals offset well to the 2004 enzo ferrari from the enzo ferrari photos to the enzo ferrari photos. They will also be joined by Michael Schumacher, who contributed to the enzo ferrari photos of the enzo ferrari photos, and the enzo ferrari reviews a power-to-weight ratio of 3.18 pounds per horsepower, and has issued around 550 certificates thus far. Certification is a first time - small gains, but significant given China's place as a result of Ferrari's collaboration with the enzo ferrari homepage by using all of the enzo ferrari photos by a 15-member official team made up of engineers, electronics experts and mechanics capable of accommodating four occupants in unprecedented onboard comfort, thanks to Eastern European sales increasing by 23 percent, as well as the enzo ferrari photos is the enzo ferrari photos of Ferrari's own Fiorano test track in under four seconds. The engine was now placed longitudinal, therefore the enzo ferrari photos of the available power.

So yeah, it wasn’t the prettiest of wins… But we totally pulled it off. With our clear ability to make other teams throw terrible passes and miss one too many catches, we continue to hold a strong advantage over most NCAA football programs. You see, other schools may pride themselves on their “offense” or their “defense.” But what it really comes down to is knowing what it takes to make the other team screw up. And I’ll be damned if someone tells me otherwise.

Clearly the South African Government is a part of the genocide that is being perpetrated by the lack of strong decisive action to control the murderous criminal behaviour of black on white. White citizens are targeted and the response from the Minister responsible for Justice states in parliament that if people don’t like the crime in South Africa they can leave. It is clear to whom he is referring to.
If an entire nation could seek its freedom, why not a girl? As the Revolutionary War begins, thirteen-year-old Isabel wages her own fight...for freedom. Promised freedom upon the death of their owner, she and her sister, Ruth, in a cruel twist of fate become the property of a malicious New York City couple, the Locktons, who have no sympathy for the American Revolution and even less for Ruth and Isabel. When Isabel meets Curzon, a slave with ties to the Patriots, he encourages her to spy on her owners, who know details of British plans for invasion. She is reluctant at first, but when the unthinkable happens to Ruth, Isabel realizes her loyalty is available to the bidder who can provide her with freedom.

One way credit could be used to grow this economy would be for the candlestick maker to borrow bread and steak for sustenance while he improves the productive capacity of his candlestick-making equipment. If successful, he could repay his loans with interest out of his increased production, and all would benefit from greater productivity. In this case the under-consumption of the butcher and baker led to the accumulation of savings, which were then loaned to the candlestick maker to finance capital investments. Had the butcher and baker consumed all their production, no savings would have been accumulated, and no credit would have been available to the candlestick maker, depriving society of the increased productivity that would have followed.

Baring entered the diplomatic service and was posted, between 1899 and 1904, to Paris, Copenhagen, and Rome. Becoming disillusioned with life as a diplomat, and simultaneously becoming enamored with Russia, its language, and its people, he resigned from the diplomatic service and arrived in St. Petersburg shortly after Christmas 1904. It was from here, in January 1906, that he had written excitedly to a friend about the books of Chesterton, particularly Chesterton's first novel, The Napoleon of Notting Hill, and his controversial book of essays entitled Heretics, stating simply and emphatically, "I like his ideas."

Its hard to imagine what they could be thinking. Are they actually backwards enough to think that if Barak Obama converted, all Americans would just blindly follow his lead, because he's the fucking President? Is it just the idea that if he converted he would look more favorably upon Islamic causes, to the extent he might end the war in Afghanistan and more forcefully support the Palestinian cause?

FULL CIRCLE. It is perhaps the hands of fate that made me return to Boracay last April as a Guest Speaker at Events Asia 2010 and as luck would have it, talk about Sustainable Events Management. With my experience at Inkaterra, Peru’s Eco pioneer and Conservation leader, I shared my knowledge and experience in Sustainable Tourism and Environmental Protection. In 1975, Inkaterra opened a lodge for scientists to study Peru’s rainforest long before eco tourism was trendy. With 33 years of experience in sustainable tourism initiatives, it is the first to be carbon neutral in the country, doing reforestation projects in a total of 17,000 hectares in the Amazon.

That’s the sort of thing you say in novels. It’s nonsense and you know it’s nonsense. Sophie wallows in the gutter because she likes it. Other women have lost their husbands and children.

I’m not talking about instituting a Hitleresque breeding program to produce a “perfect” human being (POSITIVE EUGENICS), I’m talking about common sense rules that would prevent genetic illnesses from continuing from generation to generation that create individuals that can never be competent enough to enjoy a full life and which could easily be avoided. We already do something like this with RH factor and by preventing close relatives from marrying, and therefore inbreeding. And we have genetic testing for Downs Syndrome babies. Are we really so egotistical that we believe we must pass our genes on, even if they are seriously flawed, causing untold harm and anguish to our children? Becoming a parent has nothing to do with procreating. You can become a parent through adoption.

"What children need is not new and better curricula but access to more and more of the real world; plenty of time and space to think over their experiences and to use fantasy and play to make meaning out of them, and advice, road maps, guidebooks to make it easier for them to get where they want to go (not where we think they ought to go) and to find out what they want to find out."

In recent years I've heard visitors to your shores complain about the noise, the dust and the collapsing buildings. Sometimes, though, and call me a hopelessly romantic fool, we need the scratching sound of an old record to appreciate its value. Your imperfections make you human.

I am from Buffalo. We are a town that appreciates our sausage. I am from a very Polish family. My innards are practically made of processed meats. I would love to say I am vegetarian and have the easiest excuse for avoiding these meats while tailgating, but my friends know me way better than that! Even more, I know I will WANT those processed meat products, and I am not about to give up all the great things in life if I don't have to. Everyone is going to be eating hot dogs, sausage, and hamburgers. However, I will enjoy eating these goodies more if I know they aren't a heart attack on a plate... So I substitute. First, I bought reduced fat hot dogs. Second, I am bringing some homemade venison sausage (venison is a very lean meat). And third, I am eating these products on wheat rolls with more fiber than your typical hot dog bun:
Pili Nuts - [Pee-lee] (Canarium ovatum) Looking like elongated pumpkin seeds, pili nuts are indigenous to the Philippines, particularly in the Bicol Region on the southeastern portion of Luzon, the largest island in the archipelago. Mostly unknown beyond the Philippines, pili is popular as a snack, flavored with salt and garlic or covered in a sweet sugar coating. Its mild flavor and almost airy crispness are belied by its fat content - approximately 68.5 grams per 100 grams of nut, nearly 50% more than that of cashews (45g/100g) and comparable to macadamias (69g/100g). Furthermore, the quality of its oil composition is similar to that of olive oil. As such, I decided to reduce the amount of olive oil normally used in making pesto to compensate for the richness of pili nut.

Paul used this to teach about spreading the word of God. Unlike today where we can buy seed that is 99.9% pure seed and plant rows that are identical and harvest almost pure wheat, they could not do that then. They had to rely on spreading lots of seed over as much of the ground as possible in order to get the biggest harvest. That was the idea of spreading the gospel too. Not to be picky about who heard it, but to let as many as would listen hear it and let God produce the fruit. In 1 Corinthians 3:6-9, Paul uses this analogy to teach about how the seed of the word of God is what we spread to the hearts of people and God is the one who ensures the growth.

Stop making hasty decisions and start consulting God in all you do, in this way you will always make the right decisions and remember that Jesus’ plans for you will only prosper you, not harm you. I know that it is not always easy but it is something as believers, we must do, there are times that I forget to consult God because I was too hasty and you know what, I see it fail or I see it take even longer to come to pass. I want emphasise that it is not always easy, but with God it will always be accurate. Put your faith and trust in God for all your future decision making and all your endeavours and see miracles happen in your life, that only God can do.

The author believes that there has been a revolution unnoticed by the press in controlling crime by means other than brute-force incarceration. He believes that substituting swiftness and certainty of punishment for randomized severity, concentrating enforcement resources rather than dispersing them, communicating specific threats of punishment to specific offenders, and enforcing probation and parole conditions to make community corrections a genuine alternative to incarceration. In a world where there are always more offenses than there is punishment capacity the best way of achieving less crime is to create ‘focused zero tolerance’ approach’ by clearly specifying the rules and then delivering the promised sanctions every time the rules are broken.

Games that come on CDs and DVDs are extremely fragile. Gone are the days of sturdy cartridge games from the 1980s! Today’s game discs can get scratched, broken, damaged, lost, or stolen ridiculously easily. These games are also very pricey. In the 80s, when I was a kid, Nintendo games cost around $25. Today’s games are at least double that. So, you see, it is critical for a variety of reasons to backup your game collection.

Were there moderate Nazis or moderate Stalinists? Absolutely not. There were, of course, many people who were called Nazis and Stalinists who were moderate. They were moderate people who just happened to be Nazis or Stalinists. As Nazis or Stalinists, they could not be moderate. They could escape this by being nominal Nazis or Stalinists only. Alternatively, perhaps they were only 34% Nazis or Stalinists, if such a thing can be quantified at all. If they were 100% Nazis or Stalinists, then there would have been no possibility of calling them ‘moderate’. Even in this case, perhaps they were moderate when they got home to their families, etc. This would not have been Nazi or Stalinist moderation. It would have been an example of someone who just happened to be a Nazi or Stalinist being moderate.

I think I have believed: I think I love the Savior: I sometimes hope that I am his; but am I so? Shall I be found to be a true believer at the last? Will my love be mere cant or true affection? Will my graces be mere talk, or will they be found to be the work of God the Holy Ghost? Am I vitally united to Christ or not? Am I a mere pretender, or a true possessor of the things eternal? Oh my soul, set thou these questions in the light of that tremendous day.

It’s a world that Granik portrays in such depth that Winter’s Bone never simply feels like a vehicle for its young star. The visual style of the film never falls into Southern Gothic clichés, but finely straddles the line between naturalism and noir. She then fills this world with a vivid gallery of supporting players, from the great John Hawkes as Ree’s uncle Teardrop, who reluctantly aids her on her quest, to Dale Dickey as Ree’s most intimidating obstacle, a local crime queen who has her fingers in lots of pies, all of them rotten. And throughout the film, Granik fills the frame with detail after vivid detail, from the crowds at the local cattle auction to the way a birthday party turns into a sing-along. It rang particularly true that the only option for young adults aside from crime is the military, which reels in many of its enlistees with the promise of money, travel, and the allure of potential heroism.

I’m expecting that come fall, my Opening Day experience I spoke about is nothing more than a distant memory. As long as the Indians continue to grow and learn and stay healthy, I really believe that will be a realistic expectation. The extra Wild Card spot could really benefit a team like the Indians and give them an extra chance to sneak into the playoffs this year. I think it will be hard to win the division with the Tigers and their team, but we could definitely contend for one of the two Wild Card spots. To borrow from the Indians tag line, what if we sneak into one of those spots and have to play a 1 game playoff in Cleveland? The Richter scale wouldn’t be enough to monitor Progressive Field.

The mind, for all its wonders, is a distraction. We educate ourselves to expand it. To please it we seek both enlightenment and vices, textbooks and drugs. And the pleasures of humor, knowledge, and verbal interaction become our reasons for living. It is absolutely necessary for personal satisfaction and for the advancement of society that we seek purpose for life, but we must not neglect the beauty of life itself. It is here that I propose we make a degree of simplicity a priority: immersion in a beautiful surrounding, a disconnect from the digital world. And, especially, relaxing the mind and engaging in physical activity.

A new dry bean for us this year is white cannellinis. Last year we had trouble getting these to germinate in the cold wet soil so we saved the seed from the few that did survive hoping to breed some cold soil resistance into them. It was cold and wet this year again and we got a good crop so maybe it is working. The best reason for saving your own seed is that you end up breeding strains that work really well in your garden, in your microclimate.

International community efforts will continue to lack cohesion, insurgency activities will still be significant and the Afghan government will still be struggling to exert influence across the country. A major series of difficult military, political and media issues are going to emerge between 2010 and 2012 and will further confuse, delay, distract and destabilise. These will include elections, withdrawals of international forces and renewed and critical media attention on achievements and prospects in Afghanistan. The impact of these events will predominantly be negative and be making themselves felt from 2011 onwards. This wavering commitment on the part of the international community is likely to be the the cause of further Afghan political and security difficulties.

4. The Pixar success story was another good Jobs pick of some very talented people who eventually found they could integrate their technology skills with an appeal – without sentiment or kitsch – to our shared humanity. Jobs invested in them when the animation was just a hobby – at the time they were trying to sell image rendering software. Note that, a bit like Xerox, the competing Disney corporate culture under CEO Michael Eisner had been so inimical to creativity (‘rapacious, soul-less’ – Roy E. Disney) that they had had no major box office successes for 10 years. 2006 saw a de facto reverse creative takeover by Pixar of Disney, with Pixar personnel now holding the key creative positions and (incidentally) Jobs becoming the single largest Disney shareholder (7 per cent of a current $37 billion valuation). The longest index subentries (under the main entry for Jobs) in Isaacson’s book are for ‘controlling personality of’ and ‘offensive behaviour of’, but with Pixar Jobs also clearly backed and continued to back, even under severe financial pressure, other people’s creative skills when conventional corporate wisdom would say bail out.

A belated recap of my Saturday night prerace meal - Spicy lamb and Italian sausage ragu! I made this in the style of a Bolognese sauce with all sorts of aromatics - carrots, celery, fennel, onion, garlic, fresh rosemary and thyme, lots of crushed red pepper, and a small amount of dried cumin and coriander (a little trick I learned in the "Urban Italian" cookbook) - along with tomatoes, red wine, tomato paste, and beef stock. The Italian sausage was the last of my homemade stuff (need to make more). I served it over fusilli. A very good effort, and the leftovers have been making for some fantastic lunches this week.

She said she had two college degrees at age 23. But all is not well with her. She has violent outbursts and manic episodes, hits others, and has been hit herself in what appears to be a popular recreation among crusties. Morgan always seems to be bleeding somewhere.
A leader is someone who has responsibility, commitment and accountability for his or her team. Leaders are able to look outside the box and are willing to do whatever it takes to help the team. They have effective communication skills and are able to give constructive feedback to teammates as well as take constructive feedback from coaches. After building this relationship between players the team will grow stronger as a whole and be able to work together on and off the field.

I wish people would just leave her alone, like the guy/girl said. I wish people wouldn't be so arrogant that they thought that they could judge someone elses behavior based on their own reality. Mostly, I wish that society would 'get a clue'. For Britney's story symbolizes a lot of the sins of mankind, that we judge, we are self-righteous, that we can turn on someone at the first sign of weakness and that charity is only extended to those who are similar to us.

I asked one woman, what time she had to be back on the train the next day, and she answered, “8 AM.” When I asked her what kind of home/family life commuters had, she replied, ” I am single, so home life does not matter. I get home, go to sleep, and do it all again the next day.” These folks cannot all be single, and at 8 PM, most young children are already in bed. What has this country come to? These workers appear resigned to this lifestyle, as observed in this photo. Are all major cities in the US following suit?
Because I work directly with the gentleman who supervises their entire livestock program – he's the one I contact to come pick up (spent) grain and I'm on their email list – so whenever they slaughter anything and they open that up to public sales, I obviously get the heads up.
My favorite moment as a writer is when kids talk to me about one of my characters as if she were actually alive. I want to create characters that children remember like so many characters that I have read have stayed with me.

One boy asked if there was rivalry and jealousy amongst authors! No, of course not... Actually, as I said to him, there seems to be very little amongst children's authors. We all get on pretty well, some better than others, of course, but some of my best friends are technically my "rivals" and I don't feel we really do jealousy.
2. Eating Too Fast
Mt. Humphrey’s is about 12,300 or so feet and the highest point in Arizona. We had ten minutes left and we were more than halfway up. We pushed our legs until we crested the saddle. We didn’t have time for the extra hour to the summit, but the saddle gave us an awe-inspiring view. It even began to sleet as we stood on the saddle far above the earth. On the way down, we came across that woman still working her way to the summit. I don’t know if she ever got the top, but I continue to remember her now weeks later. Her perseverance was amazing!
"We never had rats in this neighborhood until now," said Sabrina Parada, who lives around the corner from the partially-built three-family house. "We don't even know what's going on over there. There might be pools of standing water. We had more mosquitoes than usual this year."

He nodded his confirmation.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: ‘Healthy parenting’ (or lack of) is often cited as critical for a healthy society. If we are to progress this notion we need to question why so many of us are fearful to be open about the demands of parenthood?

This is a sign of what St. Paul calls the “mystery of lawlessness,” – a mystery in that it is something which is not fully revealed in this world; it is something which comes from the other world. The “mystery of righteousness” is the whole story of how God came from heaven and became incarnate in order to save us. The “mystery of lawlessness” is the opposite: it is a mystery coming up from hell, which breaks into this world and changes it. Therefore, this is the mystery of lawlessness or anarchy which is preparing for the coming of the “man of lawlessness,” who is Antichrist.
Place a heaped teaspoon of filling in one half of each pastry circle, leaving the edges clear (see photos above). Then fold the pastry over the filling to make a semicircle, press the edges together with your fingers then seal/crimp the edges well with a chopstick or fork. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
With all of that good stuff happening you'd think I was just sailing along. But, I'm not. We found out last week (long story leading up to this point) that our cat, Crater, has a degenerative disease...basically kitty MS...that will eventually make him lame in his back legs, incontenent, and eventually we will have to choose to put him to sleep. He's such a good boy, Carter. He's wonderful with your big sister. He's super loving and just an all around great cat. So when I took him in to our local vet yesterday and had to talk to him about what we can/can't do and when we will have to make the choice to put him to sleep it really bummed me out.

I only got lost (properly) once on the way home. I was very very glad when I finally rolled up outside our house. I proved that I could do it alone (well, almost alone if you don't count the three pixies) but it's not something I really want to prove again. I'm a very lucky woman to have Mr B to look after me, and last Saturday brought that home. Thanks to those who did help, and to Darren for inviting me. And I hope one day to visit Lincoln again under less stressful circumstances as it looks like a beautiful city. Complete with wrens.
Acknowledge your fear, and find a way to make it work for you. For new players, the transition from the relative-predictability of college ball (marriage) to the pros (family life) can evoke a full range of complex and often overlapping emotions. Yes, feelings. Get used them, they’re going to be hanging around for awhile. Chief among these feelings is fear. Particularly during the first game. When the ‘fight or flight’ response kicks in, be prepared to man up or suffer the wrath of a particularly terrifying defensive lineman known as ‘The Mother-in-Law.’

In its prime, the toast of New York filled its pews, including Cornelius Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor and Jay Gould. A shadow of its altruistic days can still be seen hovering over St Luke's Hospital (now St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center), which the congregation helped found. To tie this into our podcast at the beginning of the week, it was in this hospital that John Lennon died of his wounds sustained at the Dakota Apartments.

So last week had a test on Monday, then on Thursday, Monday again this week, Tuesday this week, and again today. But then again welcome to college, right? It is difficult getting used to a semester system, because even though I have been taking four classes a quarter for the last several years it is four classes over a fairly drawn out period (not counting the internship class). By now (meaning this many weeks into the quarter) finals would be looming in my imminent future. Instead I just finished Midterms. It’s much more of a jog for semester than the quarter spring where everything feels somewhat like a crash course.
Mugabe, who was forced to form a power sharing government with Tsvangirai after the international community including some of his African allies refused to accept his bloody re-election victory in 2008, has already indicated that fresh elections should be held this year.
The picture at the left shows the initial pattern that was created in Photoshop with the brush and custom shape tools on a white background. Notice that none of the icons are cut off but are within the boundaries of the sides. This is to avoid imperfect repeating when the pattern is tiled. As was stated above, the background could have been transparent when the pattern was created so that it could have been placed on any color background. The repeated pattern in the example was created with the Pattern Overlay and was scaled down to about 20% while in the Pattern Overlay window.
Although Upsweep’s relatively pure tone didn’t fit with the more varied sounds typical of other volcanic activity, the researchers speculated that it came from some kind of oscillation of bubbly liquid, perhaps seawater coming into contact with a large pool of lava. “Somehow within the volcanic cycle,” explains Emile Okal of Northwestern University in Chicago, “there must be some resonance of a column of water or gas.”
Our lawyer showed up too and I introduced him to my family and Rob’s family. It touched me he’d come. My father-in-law was so heavily sedated that he was totally out of it. I didn’t agree with this, but it was my in-law’s decision. I wondered if he’d even realized it was Rob’s memorial and whether he’d even be able to remember it. I made extra special effort to make sure my in-laws were looked after, moreso than even my own family.

Hubby and I have done stupid, inconsiderate things that have hurt each other. Some of those things I am positive have ended up on a divorce decree for someone else somewhere in this country. But we're not giving up. We've had to learn the hard way that not every argument is commentary on the state of our relationship. Not every transgression is a relationship killer.

Ten years ago today, my mother committed suicide. It’s very hard to explain what that does to a child, especially a daughter losing a mother, no matter the age. I was 34; my sister was 24. I was angry with my mother for a while; I felt very abandoned and suffered a major loss of self worth. The fact that Mom thought she had nothing to live for when, in fact, she had two daughters, one with grandchildren on the way, hit hard, and I went through a couple years of serious soul searching. But after a while, I realized there was nothing I didn’t do, nothing I could have done, that could have helped her. My sister reached that point as well, and we are much closer now than we’ve ever been, coming out of that darkness together.
Good news! I survived my final. Man oh man I knew those objects backwards and forwards. I'm actually proud of myself for how well I memorized this past week.

To be “credal”, “confessional”, and “historically orthodox” means that you hold primary those few essentials found in the creeds, and allow disagreement on all those other things. This is the most it seems Douthat is proposing; not a wholesale acceptance of every religious opinion he and the Catholic Church have.

Government Policy about media regulation in Australia, America-Australia Fair Trade Agreements and Media Ownership legislation has come and go from Federal Court in Australia in the last 10 years under the Howard and Rudd Government (Murray, 2005). Murray also argues that in negotiations for trade between countries as well as promoting Australian content both nationally and internationally, organisations like Screen Australia are presented with issues of national identity and cultural self-determination (p. 101).
Lindzey talks about his hometown passionately. I’m curious how Boljoon (pronounced bol-ho-on) got its cute name. He says the name is derived from the Cebuano word bulho, which he says has two meanings. The dual definition corresponds to two natural features of the town.
The only dent in the chiseled armor of this film is the shaky-cam, fast editing style. I believe the same level of kinetic energy could have been sustained in these action sequences using more stable photography. If that’s how it had been shot, then I would have no problems with the editing, but when you can’t discern what’s happening in these shots, cutting quickly from one to another does not help you to comprehend the visual storytelling any better. Of course, with just how slam-bang amazing this movie is, I just can’t allow that to be much of a hindrance to my critique of it. Dramatically, on levels of storytelling and acting, I don’t see how anything can be topped here, but I highly encourage future filmmakers of the franchise to give it every effort.
Anyway, Dearest Granddaughter, February 14 has many lessons for us from God. Let us always keep our hearts and souls on Him.

I have SO dreaded transitioning Miley and Irelyn from cribs to beds. The girls have never tried getting out of their cribs, but now potty training at night has become a bit more tricky. The girls are fully potty trained at day, but at night only Miley is potty trained. Irelyn has a way to go. My fear though is that Miley won't be able to go to the bathroom at night if needed when stuck in her crib. It hasn't been a problem yet, because she holds it all night, but I wonder about the future. Thus, the transition began.
The evangelist John started a church. A community built around Jesus’ teachings and the belief that Jesus was incarnate God; that he was both fully God and fully man. Letters that were passed around this church from John himself and from other leaders show us that John was concerned about what he called anti-Christ’s. This is someone who positions him or herself against Jesus or even who preaches about another Jesus; a Jesus like our own but viewed through a twisted mirror in a fairground funhouse. These other Jesuses sound like the true Jesus but they are not. According to the letters of John’s church these teachings had lead people away from the core truths of our faith: Which are love, belief in the reality of the incarnate Christ and the things he achieved.
The human body is not the only food for thought. Life abides in every square millimetre of the earth, be it observable by men or not. The world overflows with many living beings, from unicellular organisms to plants, from insects to sea animals, and from birds to human beings. If you take a handful of soil and look at it, even therein you can discover manifold living creatures with diverse characteristics. The same is true also for the air you breathe. Even on your skin, there are many living creatures whose names are unknown to you. In the intestines of all living beings are millions of bacteria or unicellular organisms that help digestion. The animal population in the world is many times greater than the human population. When we also consider the plant world, we see that there is not a single spot on the earth where there is no life. All of these creatures that are spread over an area of millions of square kilometres have different body systems, different lives and different contributions to the ecological balance. It is preposterous to claim that all these have come into existence by chance with no aim or purpose. No living being has come to exist through its own accord or effort. No coincidental happening can ever result in such complicated systems.

I posted something funny about being stranded on Facebook, waited for the storm to let up, and drove back to the office. There were trees down everywhere. One had smashed a car. I heard on the news later that a tree had smashed through a house with two men inside – one in his mid 60′s, one in his 80′s. They were trying to get to the basement, but couldn’t make it, so they went to the center of the house. Unfortunately, the tree crashed right through the center of the house. The younger man threw himself on the body of his friend as the tree hit them. The 80-something year old partially blind man crawled out from under his hurt friend, crawled down the stairs, crawled out the front door, and laid in his yard, screaming for help. It amazes me what the human spirit can do when needed. Last reports were the younger man was in critical condition. I looked today to see how he was, but I haven’t found an update.

At some point in time, the Republic of Nauru owned cruise ships, several jets (they had to be kept somewhere else because the island can only accommodate one), and properties worth billions of dollars in other countries. It’s unfortunate that the country has not been successful in managing its resources and had to eventually become dependent on foreign aid. There were serious efforts to revive phosphate mining in recent years and it’s everybody’s hope that the effort succeeds and that this time this small nation will be able to sustain this vital lifeline for its future generations.
GMO crops also offer a number of advantages for modern agriculture. Crops resistant to specific herbicides, like glyphosate, can be grown weed-free by spraying the entire field. Weeds are killed, but the crop is not damaged. Glyphosate-resistant crops are often known as “Roundup Ready.” The use of genetically modified crops can reduce the need for mechanical cultivation, saving labor, fuel, and soil moisture by employing no-till practices. Also, GMO crop plantings often reduce the need for insecticides such as clothianidin. In today’s photo greater white-fronted geese, “specklebellies,” wintering in the Arkansas Delta, forage in a harvested soybean field. The Delta is seeing increased numbers of migratory waterfowl.

Braking with the extra-large Münch drums was very good for such a heavy bike (all-up weight with rider and fuel in this case being 820lbs!), and while not in double-disc territory, they hauled up the Mammut quickly. This was especially welcome as the engine provided almost no compression braking, seeming to have very little flywheel effect in general, from idle onward...of course, Münch used a much lighter flywheel than the NSU car. The suspension wasn't really noticeable, which is itself a high complement; the front forks are Rickman items, and hold the road very well without being Italian-stiff. The riding position was very comfortable, more sport-touring mode than uncompromising boy racer, as of course, most Mammut owners were middle-aged connoiseurs, able to afford a handmade Superbike.
The specialist mentioned an interesting article which I hope to track down and blog about here in the future, which discusses how the funeral is, for grieving persons, an opportunity to build a new shared reality around the person who has died. I am interested in reading this article and investigating how it could be applied in a wider sense to the particular difficulties of cyberloss and the absence of funerary ritual.

John Carter is the ultimate colonizer. Mars was literally made for him.

One of the most common misconceptions about homeschooling and unschooling is that you have to be wealthy to do so.

The beauty of the Cohn/Levithan collaboration, though, is that they make each other better in what they are already good at. This is especially true for Rachel Cohn. Cyd Charisse is the definition of edge. But the edge in Cohn’s writing is definitely toned down by Levithan’s heart. Luckily Cohn doesn’t lose the edge, of course, but it’s quite understandable that for some the Cyd Charisse series might come over as too harsh, too gratuitous, too much like your typical teen rebel story with a character you will love to hate. However, the typical teenage antics that Cyd is up to, are just that: typical teenage antics, hiding away a lot of anger and especially fears and insecurities (there’s a lot of stuff that is unresolved, especially concerning her ‘Problem’ with the boy of the boarding school).

Yet this morning, I can still recall those Thanksgivings of my childhood and how they were filled with love, with music and laughter, the sense of belonging. I no longer see the world as perfect or my family as perfect. And, despite the erosion of some of my childhood naïveté, this remains a Norman Rockwell, magical time for me. I celebrate with thanksgiving for the goodness that coexists in the midst of the imperfection. It is a time to gather together, to remember, to celebrate and to be grateful. Happy Thanksgiving.

Trying to work things out with Nash—her maybe boyfriend—is hard enough for Kaylee Cavanaugh. She can't just pretend nothing happened. But "complicated" doesn't even begin to describe their relationship when his ex-girlfriend transfers to their school, determined to take Nash back.
It brought it home to me that it’s really not that hard to find some sort of connection with whoever you want, and that links with the high and mighty may come through social contacts as much as through senior work contacts. Of course, whether those long-range connections could actually put you in contact with the people you’d like to meet is another matter.

In many ways, Noel was preaching to the choir – the largely-male, 30-40 ish audience were clear Oasis devotees, and had appeared to memorize quite a bit of the High Flying Birds work as well. Will Noel be able to expand outside the insular Oasis audience in the future? It seems difficult, especially when you can connect nearly all of his new work to something in the past. But you’ve got to give him credit for giving him a shot.

Despite being recorded in 1973, Tonight’s The Night’s released was delayed Young’s record label, it would be two years (1975) before it finally saw its release. In the meantime during the delay of this release Neil Young recorded what would be his 1974 release On The Beach.

Seriously, you wouldn’t believe how often we’ve been told by people that we should do x, y, or z, or all of them, differently because whoever it is seems to be an expert. An expert with no experience.
The minute you enter Muir Woods, a curtain of leafy quiet descends, the cool atmosphere is flecked with dappled sunlight, and the enormous columns of redwoods fill you with awe. Though I’d never been in a rainforest, the rich fecundity of the redwoods made me acutely conscious of being in a sacred living space…an endangered sacred living space.

My major concern at this time is that of cumulative change – that is, that the Core Strategy might in total end up being substantially different from its submitted version (which is the one I am examining). In that case it may not be possible for me to recommend the necessary main modifications to make it sound, despite the intent of section 20(7C) of the 2004 Act. Therefore, you should bear in mind the advice in paragraphs 9.25 and 9.26 of the Procedure Guidance which says that it may be best to withdraw the Core Strategy if it becomes apparent that it is heading towards a very clear outcome of unsoundness.
And thank you all for being...Some Xceptionally Smug Wankers!

Next we popped in to say hi to Larry's neighbor Julie Fernstrom, owner of Brimfield. While many of our Chicago customers would remember Julie from Kane and Grayslake, she now has a gorgeous permanent outpost, full to the brim with fabulous textiles and vintage finds. Think lodge, lake, English country house. Julie also does custom upholstery, which has been featured many times in national publications. In fact, the shop's name comes from her signature plaid, not the east coast show.

The power and sophistication of the missile and rocket arsenal that Hezbollah has used in recent days has caught the United States and Israel off guard, and officials in both countries are just now learning the extent to which the militant group has succeeded in getting weapons from Iran and Syria.
At present the only place a midwife has the authority to attend women for birth is at home. We must remember, however, that there is no insurance exemption for midwives who attend women privately in the capacity of a 'support midwife' for planned hospital birth. Midwives in private practice are exempt from the requirement for professional indemnity insurance when attending home birth.
I could probably benefit from a class but I think I'm doing pretty well on my own. I've had my work checked by a local goldsmith several times, and I'm delighted to hear praise each time but also what I can do differently to make something better.
And hey, maybe those feminists are wrong anyway. It feels natural to shave and to wear makeup and heels. It feels natural to put oneself on display all the time. It couldn’t possibly be that it feels that way because we’ve been trained from birth to acclimate to those behaviors. Surely, it must be biological, yeah? Surely, the fact that girls choose dolls and boys choose trucks must be because they’re hard-wired to do so, and not because we’ve been gendering them since before they were even born …

I had to apply layer after layer of the magnetic paint to get even the lightest of magnets to stick, but the board has been in use for years, so I'd say it was worth it.

Tuesday we picked Lindy up from school and headed straight to the dentist. If you remember correctly, it’s never gone well for Lindy and always ends in puke. We’d been talking about it for a couple days so she knew where she was going. Will went first and as usual did a great job. We let Lindy watch for a minute and she was fine, until they called her name. We decided a private room would be the best bet so we headed there. I felt a bit bad about leaving Will all alone. He didn’t care a bit and they brought him to us when he was done. It took some convincing to get Lindy in the chair and to lay back and to let the hygienist look in her mouth, but she eventually let them do everything. She gagged and tried throwing up but since she had no food in her belly she didn’t throw up. She did finally let them clean her teeth and then the dentist came in and she let her put fluoride on her teeth. We got out of the dentist with no vomit! A pure miracle. We headed to Chick-fil-A for lunch and to let them play and headed home. We had to skip gymnastics because of the appointments.

As I said at the beginning of this piece, what struck me most about the film is that it is something of a “revisionist”-revisionist Western, essentially circling back to the Classical approach, both in its themes and in its style. The Coens make masterful use of long shots, encompassing the beauty of the scenery, and allowing the action to play out in well-staged action scenes that take full advantage of the choreography of the actors within the frame. The beauty of the American west is captured in a series of breathtaking shots that take on an epic quality rarely seen in contemporary films.
Anywho, I went through the posts and discovered their Tips for style and fashion. Oh! I thought. Let's see what they have to say. Maybe I'll find something useful. You can never have too many tips... While I'll second the first two, but tips three and four leave me cold.

Me thinks I Goth'd her up just a bit. I used Copic Toner Grays for the black, my favorite "dead" skin combo (BV23, BV20, C00), and for the red: R39, R56, R37, R35. The two papers are from Karen Foster, the glittery die-cut is from a LSS, May Arts bat trim, & who knows where the black heart brad came from :) Did you notice I added a little rhinestone on her garter, too? Love it.

Personally, I think the biggest problem with our healthcare is limited knowledge. If everyone knew what it should cost, instead of what it actually does cost, I think most people would demand accountability and be more willing to participate in purchasing an insurance policy that wouldn't be cost prohibitive. Maybe I'm wrong, but I doubt I am; especially if the policy holders can be part of huge groups to balance the costs of those that need care with those that don't.

I have spent most of my personal fortune to establish my new Lodge. I had a huge enclosure designed and built in the shape of a glass Mason jar – because, obviously, of the symbolism of the name – and it is capable of holding a human being who will use it for purposes of meditation and study.
I'm not even sure which class this goes with - it's kindof a morph of a few different lessons. First, I brought in the rays/background image, filled it with a gradient blue-green color (I even learned -- all by myself -- you can change the direction of the shading. Sweet.) Then I changed it to only print, not cut, but I drew a box around it and had THAT cut.

Extending this further, can Malaysians handle discussing problems of a sensitive nature (not just apostasy) rationally and resolve them together? At a Malaysian student conference I attended recently we touched on some of these issues. At the conference a speaker jokingly asked “Malaysia boleh…ke?’ I left that conference thinking ‘boleeeh!’

On the whole, a bright yellow field (which is how they are at present) is a lovely, sunny sight but you can have too much of a good thing and there is certainly nothing subtle about the colour.

I was born in Seattle and raised north of the city in Snohomish County. I graduated from Edmonds High School in 1942 and went to an office job in Seattle. In 1944, I had the idea to join the Air Corps in honor of my fiancé, who was shot down in a Boeing Flying Fortress in a raid over Germany. However, the Air Corps wouldn’t even take my name until I was 20 (in April). I walked down the sidewalk and saw the Marine Corps recruiting office. (“Be a Marine and Free a Marine to Fight.”) They signed me up, gave me a physical exam, etc., and told me to come back on my birthday to take the oath, which I did.
The early Paragons sound was influenced by American soul music and used the tight vocal harmonies of Jamaican groups of the early 1960s. In 1964, the group caught the attention of the record producer, Duke Reid, and they cut a succession of singles for his Treasure Isle record label.

However, today, while staring blankly into my fridge as I often do, I found myself staring at my box of vegetable stock and slightly craving a warm cup of broth to soothe my sore throat. Known to some as Jewish Penicillin, chicken soup has been widely known as the go-to meal for generations of cold and flu sufferers. However, my lack of wanting to eat chicken, combined with the medley of vegetables in my refrigerator that have decided to wilt in unison, inspired me to stir up a vegetable-based bouillon.
These days when it comes to buying furniture for home, I find myself slowing right down to almost a halt. I haven’t really done much with our new house because, to be completely honest, I just can’t get my head around it with everything else which is going on in my life right now. I seem to be way too busy trying to keep the shop decorated and looking beautiful instead of our own home.
I enjoyed spending time with the little huddy buddy. His aunt manda took him shopping to baby gap and got him a dancing elmo. He is getting so big.

Buzzing about in some big, bright, boring, suburban grocery store probably made me an easy target for an idle and perceptive young lady. But let me assure you I did what I usually do, pulling the energy back when it becomes personally palpable instead of trying to push karma with needless immediate opportunism. And these days, I consciously shut it down far more out of maturity than social anxiety. Still, once business had been transacted and while we said our polite social valedictions, we looked each other in the eyes again and slightly sparked the always present, tentacled flow of energy between us.

A buy-sell agreement is critical to protect each of the business owners’ interests, especially in the event of death. The first step is to select the type of agreement that best suits a given company’s needs. The next step is to identify the business owners’ personal objectives and understand their finances. The last step is to fund the buy-sell agreement with life insurance.

Whitman now moved around to the east side of the Tower, killing Peace Corps trainee Thomas Ashton, who was on the terrace-like roof of the underground Computation Center. He then ran around to the west side, killing teenagers Paul Sonntag and Claudia Rutt somewhere between the University Co-op at 2246 Guadalupe, the Snyder-Chenards dress shop, and the Sheftall Jewelry Store at 2268 Guadalupe. Graduate student Harry Walchuk was felled in front of a newsstand in the middle of the 2300 block of Guadalupe. Thomas Karr was shot a little further north up that same block–he’d just finished an exam after pulling an all-night study session. Karen Griffith was walking with Karr when she also was shot. Walchuk, Karr, and Griffith all died later in the hospital.

So it was three strikes against aspartame at this point, four strikes if you count the Bressler Report.

DR was a public radio and television broadcasting organisation which was required to provide public service programming as an independent public institution financed by the audiovisual licence fee, and TV2 Danmark was a commercial public television broadcasting organisation, financed by advertising, which was also required to provide public service programming.

NCB administered the rights to record and copy music for composers, songwriters and music publishers in a number of Nordic and Baltic States.

*Sigh* It really is true what they say. "You don't know what you got until it's gone." When we live with something that we like for so long, we become very accostumed to it, so much so that we can't ever imagine how we'd get along without it. And yet, when it get's taken from us, we just have to somehow get by. In this case I'm referring to internet service (as if you couldn't tell).

I’ve never been one for sport either playing or watching, but sport offers a useful excuse when faced with a weekend of shopping and visiting people you really cannot be arsed with.

I quite like going to the gym to lift weights, but things that involve being part of a team are not really my bag.

Growing corn is easy to start out. Peel corn kernels from fresh sweet corn, and then watch the seedlings coming out in a week time. Baby corn will start to grow within 2 months and that’s the time to watch out for pests like grasshoppers. I use newspaper to fan the leaves and grasshoppers will start jumping out one by one which I can easily catch them all. I don’t really like to spend time catching pests, so I keep a few frogs and toads around to do the job. They are excellent helpers and amaze to watch them grow such big size in short period of time.

There are several great lessons in this demonstration. One is that we can so overload our life with spinning plates that we lose track of them and they all fall down. Another is that there are limits; spinning plates slow down (there is no such thing as a machine which, once started, runs forever). Another is that one cannot be stable on a stick unless you are (a) glued to it or (b) doing something. Another is that, if you are a plate and want to be stable without spinning, you are best off resting on a larger, broader, stronger foundation than just a stick (like a table). Another is that order and stability descend into chaos if left alone or if left to human intervention.

That last one is a perennial prediction, which Kerzner of LIMRA found interesting. It seems, as far as you can go back, the existence of independent producers was always threatened by something and people always seemed to think the worst. He remembers that a decade or so ago, people were predicting the demise of independent insurance distribution. And, yet—it is still alive and kicking. So the odds are good that, in the next decade and the one after that, we’ll still find independent insurance producers. But their way of life might be far different, and for the better.
Besides these subversive acts, similar pattern of attacks have kept on going in 2009. On December 4, suicide assaulters stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi, killing 40 people. On December 28, a blast in the middle of the Muharram procession killed more than 25 persons in Karachi as the Shias across the country were celebrating the key holy day of Ashoura. On June 12, a suicide bomber killed five people including anti-Taliban cleric Dr. Sarfraz Naeemi in Lahore.
We thus have a formal declaration on the part of the Congress that the emergency created by the last war exists as regards only those debtors whose war damage claims have not been settled by the United States Philippine War Damage Commission (section 2, Republic Act No. 342), patently meaning that said emergency is, at most, a partial emergency. It is needless to point out that only a small portion of the Philippine population are debtors and not all of those who are debtors are war damage claimants.
The internet, angered by web hosting titan Go Daddy’s initial support for a disastrous online piracy bill voiced their grievances with their “domains”, moving tens of thousands of website names to other Internet domain registrars in a coordinated day of online protest.
Okay, turns out I was too busy enjoying said girly drink to take a picture of it. But here’s one of many girly drinks I had while on vacation.

Okay, so go ck out The Voice New Testament ~Step Into the Story of Scripture from Thomas Nelson and see what you think HERE! You can download a book from The Voice NTwhich is pretty cool and also see other resources such as how The Voice NT was put together. I'm always interested in the translation process of Holy Scripture and this is insightful. Go see what you think! Let me know, too! ;-))
The human was Don. His dog was “Fluffy,” although her pedigreed name (and I noticed he threw that in pretty much right away—didn’t want me to think this was just any old mutt, although, as Seinfield would say, “Not that there’s anything wrong with that!”) was "Caylee Rose."

If you know me at all, you are aware of my affinity for the St. Louis Cardinals baseball club. Having been born and raised in St. Louis, I have spent my life watching and cheering for them. While I do not consider myself a fanatic and my life does not rise and fall with their record, I do have a sizable collection of autographed memorabilia. And you’d better believe I was happy last October when they won the World Series for the eleventh time.
There are several reasons, most of them are interlinked in some way and all have been exposed over time yet none of them have been rallied against, fought against, argued against but all have simply been meekly accepted by the population with absolutely stunning apathy and everyone has been led meekly to the slaughter by the men in white coats.
Alleluia. How good it is to make music for our God, how joyful to honour him with praise. The Lord builds up Jerusalem and gathers together the outcasts of Israel. He heals the brokenhearted and binds up all their wounds. He counts the number of the stars and calls them all by their names. Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his wisdom is beyond all telling. The Lord lifts up the poor, but casts down the wicked to the ground. Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; make music to our God upon the lyre; Who covers the heavens with clouds and prepares rain for the earth; Who makes grass to grow upon the mountains and green plants to serve our needs. He gives the beasts their food and the young ravens when they cry. He takes no pleasure in the power of a horse, no delight in human strength; But the Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their trust in his steadfast love.
"Summer Echoes" will be released on Morr Music in March 2011. A limited edition Sin Fang 7" featuring the non-album coverversions of Fleetwood Mac's "Landslide" and Simon & Garfunkel's "The Only Living Boy In New York" is available since December 2010 while the album's first single, "Because Of The Blood/Two Boys" was released in February 2011. The artwork for the release was done together with Sigfússons partner Inga Birgisdóttir. “I’m cancelling that dinner-and-a-movie tonight so I can listen to this 17 times.

Until early 2010, China insisted it had only $300 billion in gold. Suddenly, it announced gold reserves of $1.3 trillion. Its claims to have mined this within China are risible – although with South African technical help, it is now mining more and more of the stuff.
W: What makes you run late: not being able to decide what to wear
It's christmas morning, there is a beautiful layer of white powder on the ground and I couldn't feel more cheerful. This is the time of the year to cherish you loved ones and appreciate what you have, no matter how much or how little it may be. Learn to be grateful, because there is always someone who is worse off than you. Don't dwell on the negative or be upset that you didn't get the gift you wanted. The simple things in life are always the best. Material possessions mean nothing if you have no one to enjoy them with. So go out and live life in the moment. I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to go grab a trash can lid and do some hobo sledding.
6. Learn to Make Even Your Irrelevant Experience Seem Relevant
So I’ve been working on a new project for a few months now and there are complications obviously – as all new projects have, but it’s also been time consuming in many instances. Without a traditional nighttime kitchen job, things have been quieter in the evenings and sometimes I catch myself still with the feeling of excessive downtime (not really true, I’m just overactive/workaholic most of the time). Basically, it means I don’t know how to relax.
Dedicated to these heartfelt themes, one day I got back to my fiction writing and realized I want to write for kids directly expressing all of my thoughts and visions through stories and characters. Thus this decision re-ignited my former love of reading great classics from my youth, and a thrill to return to what seemed my natural path - inventing the world as I see it.
I have heard more this week than in the past "I'm so excited for conference." Mostly from Blake. I don't care if they are just excited for the candy or the toy as long as they are having a positive experience feeling the Spirit of our Heavenly Father teaching them eternal truths and also knowing that this is what we do when it is conference weekend. It's great with TIVO now because if there is something we really want the children to hear, we just replay it right then and there.
I hope everyone has a Safe & Fun St. Patty's Day!!

Oh, right, and two rich white people got married today too, apparently.
Lately anything that can be made in five minutes or with one hand is what I'm making for breakfast, lunch or dinner. These smoothies fit the bill - with a bonus that I only need one hand to drink it too. Things involving forks and knives haven't been happening too often lately.

The Association of Sarcastic Sitizens, in yet another display of pointless metaphorical adventurism, submitted their version which apparently symbolized the culture of corruption in India. The stroke rises boldly upwards only to be chopped into smaller and smaller pieces towards the end as it falls ignominiously to the ground. It typifies the average citizen’s (or sitizen) struggle with getting things done as money keeps leaking as bribes and commissions all the time, they said. Needless to say, it was rejected as a result of the judges falling asleep while reading the A.S.S’ 15,000 page explanation of the symbol (they had commissioned Umberto Eco to do the writing). The organizers further pointed out that any association willing to misspell “Citizen” just so they could have a more descriptive acronym must not be trusted.
Slipping out of their clothes they slid into the cool waters and lazily floated taking in the picturesque surroundings.

I'll tell you what I'm not going to do, I'm not gonna let the misshapen density of The Tower intimidate me. Sure, it's set in Hamilton, and, sure, the characters don't say the word "out" like you and I (it sounded like they were saying "oot" most of the time), but that's no reason to be afraid of the peculiar goings on at the Sandawn Building. Besides, LOLA can smell your fear, and you wouldn't want her to zap you while you're trying to adjust the whirlpool setting for the swimming pool/jacuzzi located inside the building's state-of-the-art aquatic centre, now do we? In other words, play it cool, man, LOLA sees all.
I don’t feel like I should have to defend Andrew Kliman, who wrote a polemic against David Graeber and “Graeberism”. I have two critiques of it, but they are minor: 1) I do think Dr. Kliman should actually be tougher on the Occupiers if one thinks that Graeber’s philosophy has led to serious problems, and 2) I would want more critique of Graeber’s overall output, instead of the focusing on two interviews.

As the film ends, his enemies have discovered the stash of his money (the only thing keeping his men loyal to him). As they approach, General Yen drinks a cup of poisoned tea in his empty chambers. At his side, wearing a bridal gown meant for his future wife, Davis sits and kisses his hand. Besides the stirring artistry of the scene and the rest of the film (courtesy of photographer Joseph Walker who shot it through filters and used highly textured shadows), this sequence provides several paradoxical interpretations. It was Davis’ naivety in both her faith and the powers of forgiveness that doomed the man that she loved. The idea of a film that subversively argues against the teachings and practicality of religion was unheard of in those days.

'Your offending is of the utmost seriousness,' said Judge Dean.
The servant has been made ruler over all the master has and it is assumed that he will be doing the will of the master all the time. So he calls him blessed. Not much is said about doing what is right because that’s what we are supposed to do…
Spirit: This is another of those things that is easy to take for granted or neglect. I have to make an appointment with myself and prioritize the time to just be with God, in prayer, in praise, and in the Word. Whatever your spiritual path, I think it is vital to health to make time for contemplation (what is the meaning of my life?) meditation (be still and go within) and fearless search for truth and meaning.
Another piece of randomness I feel the need to share is that I gave myself a head injury as I was letting the dog out over the weekend. I honest to God, turned and whacked my head in to the door frame. I saw stars and let out several expletives that I am sure my kids are having fun repeating them. It grew a knot right away and throbbed! Always graceful. It is fun explaining the purple bruise on my head.
James’ central argument in “The Will to Believe” hinges on the idea that access to the evidence for whether or not certain beliefs are true depends crucially upon first adopting those beliefs without evidence. As an example, James argues that it can be rational to have unsupported faith in one’s own ability to accomplish tasks that require confidence. Importantly, James points out that this is the case even for pursuing scientific inquiry. James then argues that like belief in one’s own ability to accomplish a difficult task, religious faith can also be rational even if one at the time lacks evidence for the truth of one’s religious belief.

When it came to choosing a color, I went with Behr's Navajo White. I held up tons of paint swatches, and it was the one that seemed to match most of the items in the house at the time. And, I had seen an inspiration picture with a similar color and really liked the look.

School for my muchkins starts on August 17th. I may or may not know how many days until then. This working mom thing and school being out is NOT easy...not easy at all. Not that it is easy when school is in but this is worse. I think it has been harder on my house than anyone one person. My poor kitchen floor is just dirty. all. the. time. The kids have on more than one occasion worn dirty clothes. I have not made my bed in weeks. Dinner is more often then not a game of " what ingredients can I throw together and pass off as a meal". We wont even talk about how many times we have called popcicles lunch.
Around the Copic warehouse live 6 cats that were abandoned and are now adopted by our crew. Four of the cats are all black, so sometimes just walking to the door at work I'll have a couple black cats cross my path, but I never seem to have an unlucky day because of it. Each of the cats now has a rich, glossy winter coat of fur.
Myself? Well this week I have applied for two jobs, one in an insurance/pension office (sales assistant) and the others a solicitor (filing clerk). However, there is a few positions of care assistants going in the Leek, Congleton etc area that I need to ring the appropriate source for. I will get trained to NVQ level II in care if I get the care job, this will be great and may help me towards getting my NVQ II in childcare too somewhere along the line, although I recognise they are two different qualifications!

They searched every hole and corner of the house, and just as they were about to give up the hunt, White saw a woman’s foot inside the old fireplace. Stooping down, the detective discovered the ghost. He dragged her out into the room, tore away a sheet from the woman’s head, and discovered a trim, but greatly frightened woman. She was a Mrs. John Barrett, who had been making her home at the house, and the ghost business was merely a sham to keep people from entering the house.
As Leif got older, we relied on the Ergo every time we left the house. Diaper bag, Ergo and a wallet (stashed in the Ergo’s front pocket) and we were good to go. Grocery shopping, trips to Mama Goose, and even friends’ weddings became simple thanks to the Ergo. After a bit of practice, breastfeeding on the go became second nature for us. No one had any idea that my “good baby” was happy because he was nursing – that little “sun” hood covered everything. When other moms asked about our carrier (and so many did) I was more than happy to recommend it.
After three hours of sanding, the bottom of the cabinet was looking like I wanted it. I stood back, pushed my hair off my forehead with the back of my hand, rolled the tension out of my shoulders, and wiped my dusty hands down the front of my jeans. I turned to Bruce who was putting the carburetor back on the lawnmower. “What do you think?” I asked.
We later learned the organizers responsible for the dedication said families specifically requested that particular album be played through the sound system. Humbled by the grief and choice of music, I wanted to respond to with new music, hopefully to heal my own broken heart and possibly others.

I think the thing I am most excited about is just getting out of the house for more than a day and spending some with friends. I don’t think I have laughed as hard and as much as I did the last time I was up there!

The do-it-yourself and vaguely subversive, underground nature of FKTs is the primary attraction for me. FKTs tend to exist on routes where races aren't allowed (or the organization of one would be far too involved), but the line is so pure and obvious and hews to a certain geographical or mountain aesthetic (summit link-ups, circumnavigations in general and range traverses all come to mind) that it simply begs to be cleaned in a single, concerted push. The satisfaction that comes from pushing oneself all-out to explore a personal limit is still there but the hoopla and expense of a race isn't, even if one prepares with as focused of a training regimen as he or she would for a race. It's a very primal and largely unfettered way of being in the mountains and testing oneself.

Who will Christ be able to give this amazing gift to? The Overcomer. Who is? According to this letter, the one who can stand up against the devil’s persecutions, against poverty, jail, discomfort, and in extreme faithfulness cry out that Christ is God’s Son and the Savior of the world.
In every ‘dinner party’ situation I find myself in, when people find out what I do and want to know a bit more, I’m asked questions that go something like this; “But how do you get into the head of a modern teenager?” or “Who are your books aimed at?” And these are fair questions, but having been asked them enough times, and stumbling out some answers I didn’t really believe myself, I came to the realisation that I do not attempt to get inside the head of a modern teenager, nor do I aim my books at anyone. Anyone at all.
What I liked best about this book is what makes me want to live in Paris for the rest of my days: David writes all the ways the Parisians can drive someone to the utter BRINK of insanity, but, instead of hating them for that, he develops a kind of tender adoration for their quirks that I can really relate to.
He's not surprised there's no correlation. He didn't expect it. As we both know, the variables are huge.

If this sounds like a hypothetical situation, it's not. I know of at least two temporary-grant-of-copyright publishers that have gone out of business in the past year. Both, as far as I know, returned copyrights to their authors. Other authors with other publishers--for instance, the writer I mentioned at the start of this post--may not be so lucky.

In rejecting Petitioner’s claim, the district court relied on the Supreme Court’s decision in Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1719, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), in which the Court held that in order to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must establish that an “actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer’s performance.” We conclude the district court’s reliance on Cuyler’s “actual conflict” standard was misplaced.
