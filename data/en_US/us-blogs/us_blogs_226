There are several reasons why seeing a chinchilla in the wild might be difficult today. Not only are they few in number, they also live at altitudes that spell out death for most of us valley-dwelling humans.

Once upon a time, one of the stupid cats managed to get his leg seriously injured and infected, and I took him to the vet's, and he cost me $175, which the vet kindly let me pay in installments. The cat, who the Spouse Sparrow calls "Sleekit," then went and adopted himself out to one of our neighbors. If I had known he was going to do that, I would have sent her the vet bill.
With all of this "unhappy" stuff. I looked around and saw that I did not like anything that was going on in my life. Work, Family and Friends. So I've decided that I'm going to be the change I would like to see. While rediscovering who I really was. I was reminded of the fact that I really and truely do love crafting. While I have always had a passion for Vintage Fare. The last 6 months vintage seemed to find me wherever I went.

At “Sofia’s” usual Chinese restaurant, Mi Roo is about to dig into the food when Joon stops her. Before she takes a bite, he needs to know what she thinks about his book. She finds it moving, especially the part when Miss Jo’s identity was revealed to the public.
It’s not impossible, though, to successfully transition to being an adult. Difficult, yes, but not impossible. There are only a few things you need.

States in blue have more people coming into the state than leaving. As shown by the data, Southwestern and Mid-Atlantic states were the most popular destinations with the District of Columbia having the highest percentage of inbound moves. For those looking closely at the map, you will notice two things. First, New Hampshire is colored both red (map) and blue (box). This is a small mistake. New Hampshire is a net balanced (red) state with the amount of people leaving and coming into the state fairly equal. Second, North Dakota is a net inbound state. This is likely due to the development of the oil industry which has led to a large influx of workers.
So that's my week. How did you do? I plan on doing better next week. I think a big loss is in my future. I maintained last week and lost that big .1 pounds this week. I think I owe Team 4 some pounds.

It is important to be aware of water availability at your campsite and to prepare for the situation. Even if your campground has readily available water, a backup plan should also be in place. Be sure to bring enough water for at least two days for each person and each horse. Some horses do not like the taste of different water sources and may not drink what is available. In such cases, it is a good idea to have some apple juice, grated carrots or even to dunk the horse’s hay into water.

Released in 1964, Kitten With a Whip is wonderfully sleazy, with excellent, crisp and stark B&W cinematography—probably greenlit as a mash-up of Lolita with Touch of Evil, it’s still overwrought campy madness with some beatnikilicious “hepcat” lingo peppered throughout that must’ve really zlorched some brains back in ’64. “You think you’re a smoky-something, but you’re really a nothing painted blue!” taunts our heroine at one point.

The allegations put to the TRC about the people's war may have been exaggerated or incorrect. They were also sufficiently serious to merit systematic investigation.
I’d visited Teardrop Park while construction was going on around it. I had some concerns about its design and functionality which I wanted to study with some thought to how it reflected upon plans for Atlantic Yards. I will discuss these concerns later, but the concern about superblocking was not then among them.
Over the past few days many details have been filled in. Mr Gorbuntsov was preparing to claim political asylum in Britain. Before amassing his fortune he was jailed for robbery. He was reportedly a witness to a 2009 murder attempt in Moscow on a billionaire banker called Alexander Antonov. Oh, and he has a mistress in London and a wife in Russia.
Lee Min Ho had arrived at the wake looking really shocked and saddened by the news. And while paying his last respects, he was seen tearing at the wake.
Now we come to the final paragraph of her note to me, where she complained about the animal names I gave to my main female characters as a matter of setting them within their world in a way that made their plight understandable. Why I did what I did was lost upon this person I have known, who complained about how none of the male characters were given these animal names, missing the point of what I was after completely.

The campaign is viral, simply because it was initiated to involve the public for a certain cause with the least cost. Launched in January 2012, it asked the Filipino people to make their say about what they think is more fun in the Philippines. The campaign was simple, people just need to tag the slogan and create their own to an original picture that shows tourist attractions in the country. That was fun because it gave the Filipino a voice, and that the campaign went overboard the traditional brainstorming among ad experts. It went viral through the Internet that engaged the young digital natives.
Since it's so lovely here, I am going to share a little picture that I just took of my nine year old son vrooming around our still-somewhat-snowy yard on his little 50cc motorcycle. Just cuz it's cute!
On the Dec. 2, 1965, episode of the French television program Cinéastes de notre temps titled "François Truffaut ou L'esprit critique," Truffaut spoke at length on the topic of freeze frames and this particular use. He pointed out that in part the scene poked fun at Moreau's previous roles in films such as Antonioni's La Notte that tended to be deadly serious. However, the process isn't as easy as one might think.

What, exactly, did Seligmann do? He attended a team party in which he played no role in organizing and drank some beer. That is “bad enough” to merit widespread public condemnation and suspension from school? If so, does Brodhead extend this standard to the other 6000-plus undergraduates at Duke? How many of this total would he consider “bad enough”? Twenty percent? One third? Half? The estimated 75-80 percent who consume alcohol? I’m sure that Duke parents would be alarmed to hear that Brodhead’s characterization could apply to their son or daughter.
We ate a nice lunch: gluten free & vegan mac and cheese (a sophisticated version that was full of flavor), cream of tomato soup (using cashews as the creamy base), lentil veggie burger (on a beautiful Le Bus whole grain artisan roll), Caesar salad, and strawberry spinach salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. After two little monkeys ate most of my spinach salad, I knew I had to remake my own version at home.

Jeff and Traci have danced fierce for three months. She’s been tied up, tied down and probed with more vegetables then she’d ever eaten. Traci has stayed at Jeff’s apartment for days in a row and has missed so much work, she’ll probably be fired soon. Jeff has lied to her so many times she’s forgotten what reality is: she clings to him, desperately, for her biggest fear is being alone.

I am a water girl. I have a connection to water, and while I may loathe the gray skies of winter and spring, I welcome their raindrops. They water the plants, the trees, our earth and skin. Rain builds up the rivers nearby, that center me in their vastness.

Their lyrics were packed with goofy couplets, in-jokes and pop-culture references. And each of the Beasties cultivated distinct personas and vocal deliveries that meshed well together and could stand alone.
Writing the stories has been an interesting experience as I've been both fascinated and deplored by Jimmy Kiley’s ruthless imagination and his inventive means for killing his hapless victims (where he gets his ideas from I don't really want to think about). I should note that none of the stories involve any sexual violence - they're more gangland hits with cameras.

Surprised and ashamed that she had lost her father’s gift, the princess ran back home. As she ran her breath escaped in labored puffs, her heart pushing against the space in which it slept. Tree roots reached out, curling oddly and tripping the small feet that pounded against the earth. Small shrubs scratched at the princess’s ankles, nipping at the heels of her feet. She shoved through the tall bamboo shoots that separated the fields from her home and fled past her sister sitting silently in the garden, heading to the prayer temple. Upon her arrival, she noticed the hunched figure of her mother on her knees, trembling, her hands clasped in front of her.

the steward's hand. He pulled her from the chair. Snatching her bonnet, she pressed it on her head, fighting to get it over her loose, rebellious chignon. Forfeiting, she flopped the bonnet on the chair and concentrated on her hair. Once satisfied with the way it lay, she bent to retrieve her bag. A shock of blond curls escaped, tumbled into her face. She battled to right it in a dignified manner and realized she had an audience. At the far end of the room, a man with a full beard and hat low on his head, watched with interest.
These were long summer days, far away from the strife that was afflicting America: the Vietnam war, kids taking over college campuses, riots in the cities, drugs virtually everywhere and runaway crime. We spent the summer hearing instead of police sirens, the shooop! of ball into leather and the splash of brave divers in the lake. It was enforced innocence, these days. Where the world was far away. None of us kids knew how lucky we were.

Don’t get involved in anything that could get you arrested. There are many different places that claim they can help you get a new credit profile. Do not attempt this because it’s illegal; you will not be able to avoid getting caught. In addition to the possibility of facing jail time, you could be fined, your attorney bills may be substantial, and your reputation could be ruined.
Carnivals are better. I love a good carnival. Of course now that I am old, I can’t ride many of the rides. My favorite old stand-by, the merry-go-round is out. Since giving birth lo these many years ago I can’t watch or be on anything spinning without horrible things happening. And by horrible things, I really mean HORRIBLE things.
He is the Christ, the Son of God today. He is the Christ of the present. Yes, He was the Christ yesterday, but He certainly is still the Christ today. He will be the Christ tomorrow, but He wants to be your Christ right now. He is on your side. What He has done for others, He desires to do for you today. Let Him be the Christ of your moment, the Christ of your circumstance, the Christ of your storm, the Christ in your sickness, because He desires to do for you what He did yesterday. He was there then, He is now here with you.

The textbook advice, and recommendation by the AAP, is that infants are exclusively breastfed (meaning no solid foods of any kind) until 6 months of age. This was of course my goal, and I'm still struggling with accepting that this might not be best for my baby.
On the plus side, though, it will add a whole new dimension to my Beckham bathroom contemplations.

Fast forward to today. Kate is still that woman. She has remained stoic and strong through a very public divorce, she handles the unwarranted hate with grace, she continues to put those beautiful eight blessings FIRST. Yes, FIRST! Any mom whose true goal is for her kids to have the best lives possible is putting her kids first. Some moms work three jobs and hardly ever see their kids but in many cases that is their only option.... and they do it FOR their kids!
The kids are excited and my prayer is that this experience will be a bonding and fun adventure for all of us. Nardos thinks it is so weird that she will have a white sibling. Hana keeps begging to go buy baby stuff. Netsanet wants to be sure this wont cut into her playdate schedule. Micah repeatedly thanks me and then reminds me that he is still my baby. Oh yes he is, always will be.

Boom! He gets from a ban on cigarettes in pharmacies to the abolition of the food industry in three easy steps. This is world-class stuff.
Don’t forget the fear – yeah, right, like that would ever happen, but seriously, the fear is a really nutritious kind of mulch for your future creative efforts. Just…learn to cope with it without turning into a hater yourself, and that’s tricky, chump. As we’ve already seen, you’re eminently capable of it. I could say “if only in your own mind,” but that’s the most important component of it, because that’s where you unleash the hate on yourself. That guy you met in college? Who knows where he is, but your internal skepticism didn’t affect him at all. The only person it affected? YOU, CHUMP. And damn, boyo, it’s so backward, because you’re good at this! You can write like hell!

A friend recently shared an online article with me as it is closely related to my interests regarding renewable energy (specifically wind energy). This article titled Wind farms make climate change WORSE: Turbines actually heat up local areas is just another example of poor journalism. For one, after briefly researching what else the author writes about (celebrities, tips on how to lose weight, etc.), the title & presentation of the scientific article makes sense; clearly the author is unqualified to write about such an important topic & scientific material & lacks some understanding about the article that was published in Nature. This is truly disappointing (& that may be an understatement) in that the title is so misleading climate change deniers & skeptics will probably completely dismiss the article and take the title & subtitle to support their claims & not bother to read the article to get to the end. As near the end is where one good statement & probably the only redeeming statement in the article is made: “But they warned that firm conclusions should not be drawn until more research had been carried out.” But like I said, many will probably not read past the title even though it is a very brief article (with several ads between paragraphs). It is a shame that articles like this portray renewable energy in such a way which makes the discussion about climate change & renewable energy more difficult for those who want to create a better future.

This is a close tie between Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan. They both are train wrecks and horrible role models for our kids! I wish they would stop featuring them on all the news shows.

What was so interesting? Apparently it was fascinated by an empty yellow plastic bag left in the front basket of the bicycle. The thief took off with the plastic bag and climbed up a nearby tree. It remained there for quite a bit and I managed to snap this photo.
Ok-nam and Hye-na cross paths first. Ok-nam, told by her husband “not to come home for a while” after he leaves her at the police station, is bound for Flower Island from the start, in the hope that she might find peace there. Hye-na, in search of the mother she never met, boards the same bus as Ok-nam, but they find themselves – thanks to a driver who hijacks the vehicle for his own purposes and throws them off the bus – in a snowy landscape rather than at their intended destination. It is there that they encounter Ju-jin, who has opted out of the potentially life-saving operation and gassed herself up in her car, intent on ending things her way rather than suffering a meaningless existence without a voice. Ok-nam and Hye-na manage to save Ju-jin’s life and, with nowhere else to go, the three eventually set off to finding their way to the mythical Flower Island – and their own healing.
That you read it and comment is a bonus I never expected.
I mean, hello? Unmanned vehicles and weapons? As awesome as that kind of shit would be, the possibility of that very technology we made turning against us is not out of the ordinary. We’ve come across several films that have explored the theme of future tech possibly causing our downfall. We’ve got the film adaption to the novel I Am Legend that showed the result of how humans have gotten arrogant to try curing cancer. While they succeeded, they also managed to create a race of zombie-vampire things. Then there’s also I, Robot depicting robots becoming intelligent enough to try killing off the human race in order to protect Earth’s natural state (at least, as natural as it was in that time). And how can I possibly forget about Blade Runner, the original dystopian future film that was the epitome of questioning the argument humanity vs. technology?

We have done our part now and it is up to the courts to decide the fate of the murderess. Though our friend was taken from us untimely, we can be assured that he had had a good life and he is indeed free of all the perils that life has to offer and that we, of the living must yet suffer those perils still.
Maybe you doubt, or haven’t seen or heard much progress lately…or maybe there’s a lot of resistance coming up for you, or perhaps you are just beginning your search for a Balanced Life. Or a million other “maybe”s. But I wanted to tell you, from a DEEP space, that is vast, humble, and perfectly full of Grace: You are Doing it Right. We are OK….there is NOTHING that needs our worry or fear.
There is a bigger jigsaw puzzle in which I am only one piece. God is putting the puzzle together in His own time. But He knows where every piece goes. He is confident that every bit of the puzzle will fit perfectly, because he made each piece with His own hands. Perhaps that’s why His Son was a carpenter? It is good to remember that although the puzzle is comprised of billions of seemly small pieces, every piece is equally important to God.
I know I can do a better job of communicating with teachers. I also know that large numbers of teachers believe we are on the right track. I ask that you join me in exerting our energies on the battle to improve student performance, not the conflict between union and district leadership. The latter can, I believe, be resolved with the help of a mediator. The former can only be waged by working together toward the common goal of helping our students succeed.
There are things you'll probably need to keep track of now that you might never have had to track before. Do you know when garbage days and recycling days are? Do you know when bills are due? Buy an organizer with a decent amount of room to write every day, and use the space to note everything from birthday parties to triple-manufacturer's-coupon day at the grocery store.
Review the list with your parents and if money is not a point of debate because your parents are willing to pay the added cost (catering, invitations, cake, rentals, favors, flowers for five more tables are some of the added costs you can mention), think of the space. Can it accommodate another 50 people?
Impartiality is not the same as objectivity, neutrality or balance … though it contains elements of all three. All councilors should try to take an objective, neutral and balanced view of any planning application
It was a raucous night. The music in the disco started and could be heard in our rooms 4 floors up. During the course of the night, there were 3 false fire alarms. The management at the hotel said that it was due to smoke detectors but I tend to think some drunk was pulling the fire alarms. Ultimately it further cements in my mind why all hotels should be non-smoking.
Finally, Mr. Handsome replaces Mr. So-So! We haven’t had Spa Day in a month because of “You Know Who.” Jet. What? You know. Ok, Mom. JJ arrived during my off weekend with an ear infection. Understandable. Then, she couldn’t get wet because she had a terrible sinus infection, which required a shot, Cipro, a culture and lots of tissues. Next, we had to wait because we endured our monthly application of Frontline this Tuesday. Mom insists on putting showers aside until four WHOLE days after application. Jet, I do that because the instructions say for best results… I already found a tick on JJ’s back when combing her. Can you imagine trying to find a tick or flea in your rich, fluffy, onyx coat? I guess I understand better now, Mom.

For Joseph Cheng, it is quite different to experience using a full-frame camera (you name it, yo! FF camera has MORE benefits than you think!). The focal length of your lens matches what the full-frame sensor sees (FYI, I’ll still keep the 550D with me because it’s been my best buddy ever since the third term frosh!). If I were to own one, I might be the happiest person in the whole wide world, swear!
After two weeks of front-page headlines about demonstrations over the high cost of housing, Yehuda Shimon - a lawyer from the West Bank Jewish settlement outpost of Havat Gilad - decided on Thursday that the time had come for him to visit Tel Aviv himself for a firsthand look at the tent city on Rothschild Boulevard. As an expert in the never-ending struggle over the unauthorized Havat Gilad outpost, Shimon thought he might be able to learn a thing or two from the Tel Aviv demonstrators.
It makes me wonder why the medical fraternity are not researching the immune systems of people with autism. I wonder why they are not profiling the immune systems of people who have survived adverse reactions to vaccines, and see if they can find a pattern, so maybe we could predict (and lessen) adverse reactions before vaccination happens. I wonder why they are not looking at the similarities and differences between autistic subtypes. We've got a whole wide world of controls out there... a world wide willing cohort of parents and siblings for genetic profiling... a world that needs to work out how it's going to survive an ever increasing social and medical services load.
One of Boko Haram’s main goals (as its name implies) is to prevent Nigerian Moslems from getting a Western education (despite that being what most parents want). So far this year 14 schools have been destroyed, leaving 7,000 students without an education. The threat of attack on schools, and teachers, has kept over 100,000 other students away from class at least some of the time.

Granted, there are definitely legitimate trolls out there who enjoy creating cyber drama and hating on successful people solely based on the fact that they are successful in their particular field. Those people exist everywhere, even before the advent of the Internets, and they’re not going anywhere, no matter how many times you call them disgusting, Ben and Jerry’s binge-eating cat ladies. If those trolls comment on your blog and you don’t like it, either delete the comments or shut down your blog. But, me simply not kissing your ass, or thinking you aren’t that great at whatever it is that you do on your blog, doesn’t make me a fat jealous loser. The fact that you’re a no-talent assclown doesn’t make me fat by default. My fat makes me fat.
I also created this "Dance" piece for Basic Grey using their monogram chipboard letters. The chipboard is plain white so I started out by covering the fronts with fabric from the Little Black Dress line using spray adhesive. Then I carefully folded the fabric around to the back and secured using tacky glue. This involved a bit of clipping when it came to the insides of the letters.

But hold on! the relative share might have shrunk, but that does not mean the other guests will not get a larger share with respect to what they have got in 1999. And indeed it did: the third guest -the one who leaves an equal number of guests to their left and right in terms of wealth and importance- have had their income increase from MAD 57,000 in 1999 to MAD 64,000 in 2009.

I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Baby Einstein videos and have probably enjoyed them with your little ones and/or put baby in front of one so you could take 20 minutes to shower and change the clothes you've been wearing for 2 and 1/2 days. But did you know that some Baby Einstein videos now include a "Grow with Your Baby" feature. The Grow with Me mode offers a second viewing option on the same DVD. It contains spoken words and additional content to entertain toddlers and prolong the life of the DVD.
Back on the handsome campus, studded with Tudor brick buildings and manicured fields, Mitt Romney spotted something he thought did not belong at a school where the boys wore ties and carried briefcases.

Just look at him!” an incensed Romney told Matthew Friedemann, his close friend. – Washington Post

Therefore, one of the key issues of the book is to offer alternatives. The Pirate Party doesn’t want to abolish copyright, they want to reform it. For example, the moral rights of authors would remain unchanged, but all non-commercial copying would be legalized. In addition, DRM woud be banned entirely.
Also remember that most food storage will store at least 10 years, and some for as long as 25 years (for more information on shelf life, please see Tip #13) . In 10 years your 9 year old will be in college, and in 25 he/she could have kids of their own. Be ready to add to your supply for your kids as they grow or plan for them as adults, depending on your circumstances. It's always better to have a little extra than not enough.

For a nation so saturated with such Buddhist righteousness and integrity, we have seen a three decade long war, the full-blown armed hostilities which were triggered by an ‘isolated incident’ not unlike this in 1983. We pretend that thousands of civilians were not killed under the flags of victory. We do not think of the thousands more who remain displaced as a consequence. We pretend that our country is not rife with lawlessness, corruption, grave insecurity and violence, while we hide behind the white cloth of Buddhist morality. Such ugliness cannot happen in a land where the Buddha himself set foot thrice, we tell ourselves.
In Britain, the economy was growing when Prime Minister David Cameron took office two years ago. Adhering to the platform of his Conservative Party, Cameron took the austerity route with a host of gloom-and-doom budget cuts.

Dee: FUCKING STANNIS. Listen, I’m not saying I loved Renly. I didn’t. He was alright, he seemed level headed, and I think he would’ve made a good king. He was willing to join with Robb. No, right wasn’t on his side, but Robert wasn’t by blood the heir to the kingdoms. Renly tried to take it by force the way that Robert did, so fuck you Stannis. You let some psycho shadow self murder your little brother in an extremely dishonorable way. You can DIAF.

Fast forward to the current day. My kids are now 19, 17 and 15. My oldest is going to college and preparing to get married, my middle is graduated and trying to find work so he can afford to go to college.

Having recounted some of the Schindler story now in this post, I cannot deny that Schindler did a noble and heroic thing, although he wasn’t all that noble or heroic himself.
My dad is a wonderful man. I love him to bits and I know that he loves me – I’m Daddy’s only daughter and although I’m all grown up now he still wants to provide for me as if I were still the happy, hyper six year old that needed to be lifted up into big trees. But arguing with him is a waste of time because no matter how reasonable he thinks he is, he won’t consider anyone else’s opinion because if it isn’t the same as his, they’re talking nonsense. I couldn’t tell him I was angry because he’d have told me I was being unreasonable and I wasn’t as sick as my cousin was when she was anorexic and I hadn’t gone too far down that path so I was alright, I would be fine. Trust me, I did try.
I don’t love you like I used to.

This poem is a snapshot of the poet’s kitchen to me. It is so quiet you can hear a fly tap on the window pane which draws the poet’s attention to plants resting on the window sill and there they are green and recovering from being watered and refreshed. I can relate to such a moment in my own kitchen and this poem is selfishly plucked for presentation here just because I can relate to the poem in my own way.

Jacob was surprised to find himself in the presence of God. Sometimes we go to church, never expecting to meet God, but in the unusual and unexpected places, we are surprised by God. God wants and desires to surprise you with an encounter with Him. He wants to do it right here and now! Consider this verse Psalm 61:2 – “When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to a rock that is higher than I” You have to get out of the way and let God come in and change you and that is the problem why many will not – they are too stuck on it being about them. You hear it in all their conversations words like: me, my, and I. You need to cling to Him and get rid of me, my, and I because they are deadly foes of God encounters.

It’s customary for the bride’s sister to be maid or matron of honor, and if she has more than one sister, for the role to be shared between them. Regardless of how close you are, it’s probably best to ask your sister to stand with you at the altar, especially if it will cause a family rift if you don’t.

Officially the National Debt is £890 billion (that's right - BILLION). You might regard that as rather a lot – even if your share is divided by 60 million of your fellow British citizens. But there is evidence it is more than twice as much. Private Finance Initiatives add £130 billion and Public Pensions Liabilities add £1,200 billion, so instead of a trillion pounds, maybe it is two trillion pounds.

Also what does this say about Mitt Romney’s support for gay marriage ? He obviously has no problem hiring gay people so does that mean he supports gay marriage ? if he does support it privately then is this another sign of Romney turning on his so-called principles when in public to keep his votes in the conservative community ? Maybe maybe

I am relieved that we have done this. But, it really bothers me that I let it get this bad. I know it's because Maddie is a bit older than Isaac and he just ended up watching whatever she was. But the truth is his maturity is not at the same level as hers, and he is still very susceptible. It does matter that they are different ages. I believe it's totally reasonable for Maddie to cater to Isaac's needs and watch appropriate shows for his sake.

I like to say that Bern is a city founded by bears. Bern’s coat of arms is a fierce bear sporting enormous sword-like red claws and an equally red engorged penis. Medieval settlers came upon an area suitable for starting a village except there was a community bears already installed there. The King waged war on the bears and once victorious imprisoned the Bear King in a pit on the edge of town known as the Bärengraben. Nobody really knows how the Bern got its name. A popular tale tells of the Duke vowing to name the city after the first animal he killed on hunt. And since the 1440s there really has been a bear pit at east end of the Nydegg Bridge. Only now it is an historic site and the bears live in a natural habitat on the riverbank called Bärenpark. It is kind of odd then that this small old-world city is the capital of the cantons that make up the “Confoederatio Helvetica”.

But the senior U.S. official was not, in fact, describing the ethical reasoning behind the effort to “find bin Laden.” Bin Laden had already been found. The vaccination campaign was a matter of bureaucratic self-protection—to get DNA samples from people inside the compound, to confirm that the target that the CIA had identified in Abbottabad was correct, so that the agency wouldn’t embarrass itself. The most that the vaccinations could have done, if the DNA tests had come back negative, would have been to allow the CIA to quietly add this particular house to the list of places in which, over the course of a decade, it had failed to find Bin Laden.

But over the years I've gotten used to hearing bring where I would say take -- "I'll bring this to New York," for instance, spoken by a husband sitting next to me in Boston. And even when I was still suspicious of that bring, it was clear that bring and take often hovered on an imaginary threshold, with only the speaker knowing which point of view was assumed: "Shall we bring/take an umbrella?" (See Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage for a thorough and sympathetic analysis.)

I have this ongoing argument with my husband, who hates fantasy fiction (even mine! I ask you!), because ‘it isn’t real.’ To my last breath I’ll argue that fantasy fiction can be as real or unreal as any other kind. All a writer has to do is tell the truth – whether it’s the truth about your holiday in Barcelona or your Journey of Self-Discovery with Chickens. It doesn’t matter if it’s the truth about ancient Romans, the Battle of Britain, hobbits, dragons or mermaids. So long as it’s the truth, it’s real, and for a writer it’s an obligation. Anyway, readers can tell.
I'm scared.

And of course that’s exactly what we’ve seen in recent decades in industrial society. The Glass-Steagall Act, which imposed resilience on the US banking system at the cost of a fair amount of inefficiency, is a good example; it was gutted by an enthusiastically bipartisan majority, giving us the highly efficient but hopelessly brittle financial system we have today. Many other measures that put resilience into the system were also scrapped in the name of “competitiveness,” though it’s worth noticing that America’s ability to compete in any arena that doesn’t involve blowing large chunks of a Third World country to kingdom come has gone down steadily while these allegedly competitive measures have been at work. All of it, slogans aside, served to free up resources to maintain living standards for America’s privileged classes – a category that extends well down into the middle class, please note, and includes a great many people who like to denounce the existing order of American society in heated terms.
ALDERMAN GARTH Corriveau’s name is always one of those tossed around when people talk about up-and-coming Dems.

We've also been car shopping the past two weeks. We don't really need a new car, and we're not even getting rid of my Honda Accord for at least a few more years, but for some reason, now seems like a good time to buy. The problem is that we figure if it's going to be something we're going to keep for 10-15 years, we better get something with a third row seat AND a good amount of storage. But by that point we are basically limited to Tahoes, Suburbans, Sequioas, Expeditions (XLT), and Yukons (XL) and possibly the Saturn Outlook/GMC Arcadia. But of course, those are all beaucoup moola! So then we are looking at used ones and really its a toss up. If you go too old (older than 2007) the interest rate to finance it is 3.897%, so it makes sense to leave the money in the bank earning 4.5% (our new credit union checking account rate!), but if it's a 2006 or older, well then we might as well just pay cash. So then we look and they all have super high miles for their year and are really beat up. So we're getting quite frustrated.
I hope this helps! I'm always curious how long it took other women to lose their "baby" weight too, I think it helps knowing that for many of us, it takes a loooong time!

So the SIL & I have been conversing pretty routinely regarding the state of our uteruses (uteri?) and other such fertility stuff. We are having some pretty big issues w/the nurses at Dr. J's office (but more on that later) and I was telling her how I am ready for AF to come so I can get this cycle on the road. And she asked me "Are you nervous about going into this Fem.ara cycle?" And I have to tell you, like I told her, I am terrified. I am actually more nervous about this cycle then I was when we were TTC Lulu. She asked me why (since we had so many m/c before we had her) and I told her, now I know what joy, what a miracle having a baby is. How it changes your life. How much we stand to loose if this doesn't work out, or if we have another miscarriage. I don't understand why just being on the Glu.metza didn't work this time, why we have to move onto fertility drugs and treatments. I'm just at a loss. I figured if we had to go through RPL or IF again after Lulu, that it would be easier because we had done it before. I've learned over the past few months that IF is not something gets easier each time you have to experience it. I am so, so nervous about starting actual fertility treatments, and we aren't even doing any procedures. I want it to work so bad. I had been keeping it together really well, & it was nice to get it off my chest how scared and nervous that I am.

So I started checking the smear every half hour or so and after about two hours I suddenly found about 25 of my little victims all crowded around gorging themselves. They reminded me of cattle around a large feed trough, they were pretty cute all lined up. I felt a short pang of guilt about it, but, gosh they just have to go!! I also noticed as they started getting full the ones that were moving off were staggering around like little drunk sailors. If you listened carefully you could just about hear them hiccuping and calling out to their friends that they were going home to sleep it off. Ok my imagination is running amok. LOL. I touched a couple of them and they certainly didn't scurry off like normal so I knew the Boric Acid was having the desired effect. Hmmm or was it??

A home for my heart
Up for the week: Nothing HUGE that must get done, but a lot of tiny things. My parents came to town this weekend and my mom helped me tackle our basement all day Saturday. It felt AMAZING. AAAAA! When we first moved in here, it was only going to be for 6 months. So the basement, made up of two halves, ended up being a "catch-all" place. One half was chock-full of our moving boxes, still packed, all the things we loved. The other half was the place for "MISC." Things we needed, but not immediately... half unpacked boxes... new stuff we acquired but didn't have a place for. Photography props. Outgrown toys. Empty boxes saved for future packing or care packages or whatever. Now, 2 years later, it had gotten OUT OF HAND. And I've been in the mood to trim, pare, purge my life so very much, that I've been itching to get down there and make magic happen. Purge with a vengeance. So this Saturday was AMAZING. With the help of my powerful, energetic, incredible mom, we got the crazy half of the basement SO organized--- stuff trimmed down to a third of what it was before.... so many things thrown away or donated... And a new sense of order-- a more PERMANENT sense of "basement order" down there now. So much so, in fact, that my parents brought with them a full-sized bed and frame and we'll set it up in a cozy corner down there (what basement is EVER cozy, I ask you? NONE. So I'm being optimistic when I call this corner cozy.)... and there will be a little more space for the family we love that we often host. It's no "Oprah Guest Room"--- (my dream guest room, someday, will TOTALLY be like Oprah's guest rooms in her home(s)--- gorgeous linens, lovely light, and a gift basket with a novel or two, a bottled water, a bag of something yummy, and , like, a freakin' brand-new BATHROBE or something... SOMEDAY.)--- so yeah, it's not THAT, but it'll do.

Instant Chemistry is a dark purple leaning red. The application was just like any other polish, and despite my poor clean up (sorry, I didn't realize how rough it was until I looked at the pictures on the computer!) was a very normal application. I found no flaw with the magnet itself, though it must be said that the magnet is pretty easy to use, but challenging to master. The magnet has a nice little groove in it so it can sit right below your cuticle comfortably. I always got a decent image, but I did have a few times where I got the magnet too close to the nail and smudged the polish- the magnet does clean off with polish remove though. It also took several tries to figure how to get a centered image.

The patch of transplanted marigolds that you saw in my last post filled out nicely. Here you can see a picture of them one month after the transplant and again as they appear today. They have grown so thickly that they have closed ranks with no space between the blossom heads. An insect could easily walk from one end of the patch to the other without need to take wing, so dense is the carpet of bright yellow orange blooms. My coleus is not to be outdone, exhibiting its green-edged scarlet leaves in an impressive show. As usual, my black-eyed susans were a riot of flowers, completely taking over the northern border of my front garden. Alas, they will riot no more in my yard as I have uprooted them all and given them away to other deserving gardeners, keeping only a large potful for myself. I have reclaimed the space they used for next year's vegetable garden. I have enjoyed the few herbs I have planted this year so much that I am determined to do more of it next year.

Anyway, I had just learned to ride horses when the first spring show rolled around during my eighth grade year. I’d also become a proud horse owner thanks to my “second parents,” dear family friends who owned the farm right next to the school. Peaches and I had very little experience together as a team. She was young and considered “green,” or not at all well-trained. We were definitely not ready for a horse show, so I planned to watch and see what I could learn.
So, there you have it! a $1 mop! Would it cost us more than $1 to make it? Yes. Please don’t slam me for buying a mop that was probably mass produced by children in a foreign country as you type away on your mass produced electronic gadget that was probably produced by the same kid.

The best parts about any Ladakh zanskar Tour would be seeing the great ranges of the Himalayans and of course, the Zanskar Mountain. It also has a valley system which is dominated by the population of Buddhist communities. As you head to the Pazila watershed right on the road of Zanskar, you would first get to see the Stod Valley, which is one of tributary valleys in the place. It renders you an amazing view of the Drang-Drung glacier which is believed to be the biggest in the entirety of Ladakh. The rest of the wide area of Zanskar is about mountains and other deep gorges.
I hope I don't bore you with this post. I am at a critical point though, and although I don't air much personal stuff out here, I feel I need too. Life is super busy, good busy and crazy busy. I am trying to find a balance between running a business and taking care of a family, and there are plenty of days when I feel like I am failing in one department and can't please everyone. Bigger than that, I have struggled for eons with getting organized. I am actually amazed at how much I can accomplish in my crazed ADD world, but it is usually at the expense of those around me. My husband especially.

02. Feel A Whole Lot Better
I’m not the only one that is in pain in the house at the moment – Mrs B and I were having dinner the other night, when a loud screech disrupted the night air and the cat flap erupted in a ball of black fur that streaked through the kitchen, leaving a trail of black fuzz like an etch-a-sketch pad in the hands of an active epileptic.... Mrs B almost hit the roof, while I took the opportunity to check the underside of the table to make sure it was safe.... when Mrs B had returned to terrafirma and I had finished off the vital (and long overdue) table safety inspection, we went in search of a rather disturbed Mischief. We discovered the poor thing in one of the spare rooms, puffed up to twice her normal size (very impressive considering the amount of fur that had been distributed along her epic escape route), her little heart pumping away like a small boy who has just discovered underwear catalogues. Her tale had a rather distinct kink in it and she spent the next few days struggling to sit down and getting very tetchy at any attempt to inspect the damage. We are not sure what attacked her (Fox, neighbourhood cat, territorial robin), although to be honest she can be a bit neurotic at times, I have seen her panic and streak across the garden after doing a poo (truly a case of being scared shitless).

You have guessed it by now I am sure. I had to take the kitties back to the vet again for yet a third rabies shot in 18 months and will have to take them back next week for another titer test. Oh is Godiva going to be thoroughly pissed at me, and the vet. Every vet and web site I check says that many rabies shots will not hurt them though. They could probably spit on other cats by this point and project immunity on the other cats.

The bad news is that I didn't see as much of the game as I normally do. I was spending more time (and money) watching and buying for Shyanne.

Let's dance.
SO MUCH BETTER, Y'ALL! So this episode really sold me again after a lackluster third episode. The story? It's the first day of the workshop and Karen's pretty excited to be there until all of Ivy's minions (how is she friends with every single ensemble member?) start being bitchy to her because she acted like every single other up-and-coming Broadway wannabe and *auditioned* and *came to her callback* and was *good*. So she *almost* got their beloved Ivy's part. WHAAAAAT? Anyway, they're all horrible to her. Ivy is playing Diva Extraordinaire and getting Karen kicked out of each of the numbers for drawing focus (a fair enough criticism, but lay off, Ivy!). Karen's ticked that Ivy is sleeping with Derek. Dev is super busy (yet still delicious) being important at the mayor's office. So Bobby - who seems shaping up to be Karen's new ensemble BFF and friends stage a fashion intervention, get her into dance class (why is she not in dance class?) and tell Karen off for pulling focus in a much-needed You're In The Chorus Now speech. Not sure how well it takes since Karen ends up dancing in the front and singing, but I'll take it.
Amy ups her game a bit with this installment. She has added some extensive (albeit, made up) research into her story and the way she goes about revealing it is a fun adventure for both Kate and the reader. I like her Revenant mythology and was surprised by some of Kate’s findings. I think she needs to work on her ability to keep the story from being too predictable. Though, considering the twist that she gave us at the very end of Until I Die, I doubt we have to worry about that issue in book three. Or, at least, I hope not.
Delightful though the story of Pinocchio is, it does raise a serious question. Does the fantasy of creating a child through magic suggest that humans have some deep dissatisfaction with the fruit of their own seed? I sense that many human parents expect their children to appreciate them as their benefactors. If so, they expect too much. No infant will ever accept that it is indebted to anyone for the pure fact of its existence, or even for the sustenance it requires in its early years. A mother may describe the trials of her labour in excruciating detail to her child, but the most likely response she will get is a rather bored resentment. The child, after all, did not ask to be born.

I will start with a quotation from one of my heroines, George Eliot, which I first wrote down in my teens, in purple ink with silver underlining in a miniature ringbinder of blue plastic, adorned with a suitably profound Snoopy sticker, along with various other bon mots which appealed to my dreamy, romantic teenage mind. My teenage days may be long gone, although the tendency to romantic dreams of a more bucolic kind perhaps persist, but I think that Eliot's inevitably wise words are worth repeating.
Now, at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, middle-class taxpayers are going to be forced to bail out the Democrats’ two most important constituent groups: rich Wall Street bankers and welfare recipients. Political correctness had already ruined education, sports, science and entertainment. But it took a Democratic president with a Democratic congress for political correctness to wreck the financial industry.
The first two parts of this series described many of the qualities that the people of the end times will have. That covered the first four verses. In this part we will go over verses five and six to learn why those qualities are not just talking about the people of the world but about the church and why this is a prophecy about a coming apostasy.

“Barack said he wanted to meet me in secret, in a secure place. And I said, ‘You’re used to coming to my home, you’ve been here countless times, so what’s wrong with coming to my home?’ So we met in the living room of the parsonage of Trinity United Church of Christ, at South Pleasant Avenue right off 95th Street, just Barack and me. I don’t know if he had a wire on him. His security was outside somewhere.”

McLaren have also altered their exhaust system over recent races, switching from a simple oval profile tail pipes, for pipes that pinch-in to form a nozzle at their exit. Also the detailing around the floor area varies by track, with more or less floor being cutaway around the exhaust exit. This alters the amount of exhaust flow passing beneath the floor to suit differing ride heights. As one of the functions of the EBD is to act to seal the diffuser, often likened to a virtual skirt. The high energy exhaust gas, prevents other airflow entering the diffuser, thus maintaining downforce.

It’s quite obviously based on a book and the film just makes you want to read it! There is intrigue and international mystery and the threat of sudden death but also the pervading question of what the fudge is going on here? It’s quite exciting in it’s own way.

He walked over to the anvil, dropping the tongs and transferring the hammer to his left hand. The right hand he laid on the face of the anvil.

Slight spasms coursed up and down his arm.

I could have rushed him off somewhere for tests and without a doubt someone would have found something to start “working” on. However, I stood my ground and calmly said I would worry if it hasn’t improved by age 4. I also had to take my own advice, having given a mum this recommendation when her 3yo wasn’t talking. It turned out he spoke non stop when he turned 4,5yrs old. So with that in mind I let my son develop and he has, sure he struggles pronouncing some words beginning with sounds like "sh" or "j" but if we correct him he copies how we say it and slowly he is making fine progress. We also make it fun for him and he loves trying. He is talking more and more and becoming easier to understand so I am glad I waited.

Clues can be straightforward or cryptic. You can also include map coordinates or compass bearings from landmarks. Think about using wordplay in your clues as well as multiple choice questions or poetry. If your group is doing a theme-based activity, base your clues around that same theme. Or, write a story and incorporate landmarks into it with various turns and paces thrown in. Clues can even be based on sights, smells, sounds & textures of nature (rippling water, smooth white bark).

Today, however, I feel like this same elevation of the individual has become cheap and cliche. “Self-help” is an entire section of every book store. Everyone seems to love saying “believe in yourself,” including the institutions that attempt to destroy that same individuality. Effectively, we’ve taken some very good works and turned them into cheap, feel-good programs designed to make you feel better about yourself without actually changing much about you. In reality, you’ve buried reality so deep you’re out of touch with it. You’ve done exactly what existentialism DIDN’T want you to do.
The first President of my time that I can remember was Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma (1992 to 1997). I remember that we had numerous complaints against him when we were in school. “He is fat”, we used laugh, “He has a broken knee, he can’t even walk properly.”, “Look at him, he’s soooo old.” Conveniently forgotten were the the facts that the guy was a freedom-fighter, a professor at Cambridge and an internationally famed legal expert.

Scot is an expert at comfortable, transitional, interiors. I think he has a real strong-point in lodge and smoking room style inspired interiors. When one browses his portfolio an instant sense of warmth, cozy comfort and welcoming is sure to follow. However, that is not to say that Scot is not a master at creating a more modern interior, his contemporary spaces are every bit as well done. His sense of balance with multiple patterns and colour palettes is superb, he also tackles asymmetry very well. I also admire Scot’s ability to create an instant mood for each space he designs.

One fantasy book I thoroughly enjoyed and can enthusiastically recommend is Here, There Be Dragons by James A. Owen, a book I happened upon while perusing the library shelves. It weaves classic sci-fi and fantasy references into a well-written and engaging fantastical tale of adventure, with a clever revelation. It is the first book in The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica series.
This resulted in rampant multiplication of the cancer of sahajiya. Today there are more than hundred malignant tumors attacking the body of ISKCON. Thousands of innocent souls seeking shelter of Your Divine Grace are misdirected into the faith that these persons are their personal gurus, to be revered and worshipped as per standards taught by you in the matter of perceiving and treating a bona fide guru by any sincere disciple. Your Divine Grace did never taught of any kind of semi qualified bona fide guru with a lower standard of reverence and worship like once a year puja, etc. from the disciple.

Below is a reprint of a tongue-in-cheek article that appeared in Thursday's Chicago Tribune.

After that I talked with the brewer for a bit and sampled a few of the offerings. Strange to say, I really enjoy Pelicans standard beers, but their special releases are... well.. not my thing. I thought the Wee Heavy was rather bland, not enough earthiness and character, more like a typical American strong ale. The Bridal ale didn't have the malt depth of a good Bier de Garde. The Pelican Brune didn't have hardly any carbonation, leaving it flat and lifeless. I think Pelican makes an awesome IPA, stout, dark, and Stormwatchers is delicious, but all of these seasonals just seem to be mediocre. Even their Saison and Gran Cru which I had last year had a vegi flavor like they were rushed.

By the time Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein she had eloped with a poet, lived in France, been estranged from her father, had a baby girl and lost her, become wealthy, accompanied Byron to Geneva, and had a second child, and lost her sister to suicide.

We have already had several opportunities to share about different aspects of our faith on this trip, so this is what is on my mind today. You never know when the Lord will put an opportunity to share your faith in your path, and you don't want to be caught unprepared, so do a little thinking this week about what you would say if someone asked you the all important important question, "Where does your faith/hope come from?"
We fear hurt feelings, confrontations, disappointments and general frustrations. Our lives would be so much clearer if we ask powerful questions and gave powerful answers. Everyday I realize how much more there is to learn. When our children ask “Why? Why? Why Mommy?” its music to my ears.
This divorce is taking much more time than I thought it would, but then again, we were married for 12 years, so I guess one year is not too much to bear in order to dissolve it. It is much harder than I thought it would be. I used to say that it was too easy for people to get divorced, so when things didn't work out, no one bothered to work on it - they just filed. I take it all back! Getting a divorce is one of the hardest things anyone ever has to endure. Not just the time component, but the gut wrenching emotions that come with it.
Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, warned she was “technically prepared for anything” and said the utmost effort must be made to ensure any Greek exit was orderly. The effect was likely to be “quite messy” with risks to growth, trade and financial markets. “It is something that would be extremely expensive and would pose great risks but it is part of options that we must technically consider,” she said.
But probably the best gift was for Shelby. When Luke stayed with us in March, we planned a trip to our favorite photographer, Andrea. She actually made my dream come true...to have ALL THREE of my grandkiddos in the same picture! It was our first day with Luke so we had no idea how our little trip would turn out. We gave Shelby a framed print of Luke with Maddie and Maci. Her reaction was priceless. She was so surprised and SO loved it! And we were so proud of M&m for keeping our suprise a surprise!

Starkwell, Lovelock and me all left the room then, and came back ten minutes later, to some kind of weird bar makeout scene. And then these zombie girls ate a guy. While it was a welcome addition to the film, as Starkwell noted, “It seems a bit out of place.” The insane close-up of a guy furiously playing the cowbell, on the other hand, was perfectly at home in this completely incomprehensible film.
The YSL Vernis À Lèvres (lip laquers, $32 for 0.2 fl oz.) are a curious hybrid of a stain with a gloss with the texture of a sticky liquid lipstick. The glossy stain definitely feels quite peculiar on the lips and make the wearer ponder the mysteries of modern cosmetic chemistry; or it could be just me. My favorite way of applying the stain is to put on a sheer coat and smooth it on the lips with a finger, and then top off with a more generous second coat. The effect is a gorgeous glossy pout that lasts for at least 4 hours in mint condition - I can't really attest to the wear above that, because a girl has to eat. It also lasts reasonably well through nibbling, but a larger meal would require some consequent touch-ups.

Still, her begging me to teach her to read is better than me forcing her, so perhaps I have inadvertently created a good learning situation, since she has never been the kind of child who just does as she is asked!

The dynamic of “Tiva” could very well be lost if it becomes reality. We’ve all seen that happen far too many times on our favorite shows, haven’t we?
The romance was executed well and didn't come off as forced. Although I'd rather have seen how the romance between Eryn and Wade played out instead of that of Alec's. Although Under My Skin doesn't add anything new to the paranormal genre it was still a decent read and for those who are fans of vampire and werewolves this might be for you.
01 Saiten en Flammen (Part 1)
- Shift your focus off of self-condemnation. When our conscience relentlessly condemns us, remember that Christ will have the last word. He is judge of the living and the dead (1 Peter 4:5) and only he can pronounce the final sentence. Christ is the judge — not us or our conscience. So never for a moment dare to take the judge’s place by proclaiming irreparable guilt when he proclaims hope, grace, and pardon. If we think our sin is too great to be pardoned, remember that Christ doesn’t agree.
Poor girl. She has her mother's teeth. I used to get called Monster Munch teeth, they were so big. But then I got a brace, glasses (and not cool ones, Deidre Barlow/Christopher Biggins style), and skinnier legs, so the teeth teasing was replaced by boys running up to me to put their hands around my ankles whilst running off and calling me Bony Joanie (a character from Garbage Pail Kids, all the rage in 1987, see above. That was me aged 12).

Cute new product alert!!! Well it is new to me ;) It is Clinique Chubby Stick Moisturizing Lip Colour Balm. Now I'm not sure I would call it a "balm" but it is cute and I love the way it looks-just a touch of subtle color. I struggle w/ not looking too 'done' while I'm teaching classes at my studio. I mean I always wear make up (wouldn't want to scare my clients away), but I am exercising so some lip colors seem a tad much. But these Chubby Sticks are perfect!! Here is the info from Clinique:

As for his famous (or infamous) "Valentine's Day Tweet", in what sense does predicting a "potential earthquake time for the planet between 15th-25th" with a slight narrowing down of scope to "especially 18th for Christchurch, +/- about 3 days" for a city which had suffered three thousand or so aftershocks since September require any great acumen? And how does getting the day of the "big one" wrong (and not even within your scope of variation, albeit quite close to it) inspire such unreasoning awe?

If you like a good microbrew beer, then Sierra Nevada Brewery hits the spot with their award winning brews. They make a wide variety of tasty beers and even offer seasonal ones too. My favorite is Summerfest, light and refreshing. At the brewery they also have a restaurant with amazing food, a gift shop with all kinds of goodies (their mustards are sooo good!), and a "Big Room" where they have live music.

I believe I keep track of the Frisco Bay screening scene well enough to assert that Canadian DIY director Denis Côté's exhibition history here is on track to becoming the mirror image of Swanberg's. If the latter's work has been absent from local screens after seeing his first three films brought to town, Côté has had a steady increase in global acclaim for his first five films, none of which have shown locally. Finally, he broke through when his fascinating short Les Lignes Ennemies screened earlier this year at Yerba Buena Center For The Arts (which has a terrific December-January lineup by the way). And this week (for only one and a half more days, "thanks" to the holiday Thursday) his latest feature Curling is playing New People Cinema. I saw it in Toronto last Fall, and can highly recommend it, but my friend Adam Hartzell is much more attuned to particulars of the cinema of Canada, so I'm proud to host his review here on my blog.

Many stampers like to use a variety of coloring mediums for their stamped images. They use Copic Markers, chalks, sponging, colored pencils, watercolors, watercolor crayons, etc. I like all of these methods of laying down color. However, I often use 2 or more of these mediums at once. I've used Twinkling H2O's, Copic Markers and Inkssentials pen to color this rose!

Hey, everyone! This is going to be a shorter post than my usual... wait, who just yelled "woohoo!"??? Shush! As I was saying... short post. I'll fill you in later on my buzy week, but I have about 30 minutes to get this done, so to the point I go...
So. You want to be known. You want to be loved, no, you want to be adored by the masses, for them to worship your every footstep, for them to wash and kiss your toes, perhaps even erotically. If you swing like that. Ew. You want money, you want power, you want the pleasures of a flesh and a dramatic boost in your ego, perhaps damaged by a feckless woman or tragic childhood. Well heck! I’ve got the solution for you! Generate your own Personality Cult! Pfff! You say! That’s ridiculous! And there are far too many exclamation marks in this post for the author to be anywhere nearing sanity! Well, sanity and all logic does not matter dear friend, not where personality cults are concerned. So discard these middle class virtues, and let me teach you how to be successful!
Transleted in numbers with an example we'll have this: if on the card there's a 133x it means that the amount of data written in a second is equal to 133 times the unit of measurment used for the CD writing speed (that is 0,15 MB). In this specifica case we'll have 133x0,15 that's equal to 19,95MB/s. Should we find a 200x card the speed would be 200x0,15 or rather 30MB/s.

A final thought in this matter is to consider taking 800-1000 international units of vitamin D a day or more if your Dr. tells you that your blood tests have indicated that it is low. Studies of various populations have shown a link between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of sarcopenia.

The first time we were at my sister in law, Marissa’s, house. We were sitting on her couch and McKenna was next to me laying on her back when she started to roll over to her side and got stuck (with us going, “do it do it do it do it”) and then she fell back onto her back, but she tried again over to her side and finally flopped over to her stomach. She was on a bit of an incline so that helped of course, but it was so wonderful to see her do it for the first time and be with family when she did!

We have what it takes to cause Americans to turn on their TV’s and root for good ‘ole Team USA. So why don’t they? Because America doesn’t know – and it’s time we started telling them.

I hope that when Scooter Libby gives his first jailhouse interview to Barbara Walters, he will remember Miller's steadfastness and not reveal too much. Invariably, Walters will ask Libby, "What kind of a tree are you?" I think the Vice President will be pleased with his response. "An aspen," he will say. "An aspen."
The general consensus seems to be that the three records they released in 1969 (What We Did On Our Holidays, Unhalfbricking and Liege & Lief) are the band’s best, and that what followed was a slow and steady decline. Certainly, the departure of Sandy Denny (their key attraction at that point) was a major blow, and the band’s infatuation with esoteric traditional material ensured that it wouldn’t have much more than a cult following. Still, they released plenty of solid albums in the 70s, most of which made little impact at the time, and are today only beginning to be rediscovered. Case in point: Pitchfork reviewed the reissues of What We Did On Our Holidays and Unhalfbricking, giving them high ratings of 8.8 and 9.3 respectively, without so much as mentioning the 10 or so other albums of theirs that had also been reissued.
Stevenage are currently in pole position by the slenderest of margins, they are on 70 points with a goal difference of +22. Hot on Stevenage’s heels are Notts County who are also on 70 points and are only behind Stevenage due to having a goal difference of just +9.

If you happen to have the equipment and wherewithal to sterilize and seal jars, you could jar the lemon curd and store it at room temperature for up to 3 months until opened, at which point it should be kept in the fridge (for up to 4 weeks). If, like me, you're better with Tupperware than boiled glass, just seal it up and pop it straight into the fridge. It'll need to sit awhile to set to its proper, jellylike firmness.

I am hoping this shined a little light into darkness.
Fact. I’ve missed blogging for my personal love of blogging. I admit it though, being by a computer screen every second is causing me to not be anywhere near one when I get a spare moment. But now that I’m here and so much happier to actually be sitting here writing on the Mathurini blog, let me tell you – there has a been a LOT happening recently!

David who slew the giant Goliath as a shepherd boy failed to slay the giant of lust within his heart as the king (shepherd) of God’s people and commited the sin of adultery with Uriah’s wife, which displeased God. So how could it be said that David had a heart of integrity? God chose David because he was a man after God’s own heart (Acts 13:22). So David started out with a heart of integrity. But when David wilfully sinned against God, his heart was divided between the matters of the Spirit of God and the flesh; no longer wholesome, no longer complete. So God sends his prophet Nathan to confront the king and David repents. In his prayer of repentance David prayed that God creates in him a clean heart (Psalm 51:10) and later affirms that God will not despise a contrite (remorseful) heart (Psalm 51:17).

Gingrich is the oldest of the Superman pack, born as the Allies began to retake Europe from the Nazis. I’ll admit the idea of a Gingrich White House frightens me more than a Romney White House (The New York Times Magazine recently dubbed Mitt “All-Business Man, the world’s most boring superhero”). A Gingrich White House would be more like Lex Luthor winning the Presidency back in 2000. An event eliminated in the recent DC universe reboot.

Again, in hindsight probably not the best thing to say since one, he wants me to hit him and two, he would probably hit me back, but it was a text, so I felt safe talking a little smack.

“Yeh koi insaniyat hai,” he shot back at me (Is this humanity?) before continuing, “Nirdoshon ne kya bhigada tha kisika?” (What had the innocent victims harmed anything of anyone). A palpable disgust took hold of Usman as he flailed his arms in the little space the taxi afforded him, venting his anger at the terrorists who shared his religion, his voice shaking, and eyes wide open. With old age the voice can quiver when rage takes hold of it. A quivering voice even if an angry one can project little menace, compensating instead with flailing arms projecting the anger in the arc the hand describes. Usman looked to be nearing seventy.
Food as Fuel My diet has been pretty good this week. Not perfect. But pretty good. I've eaten things like cottage cheese, unsweetened applesauce, whole wheat english muffin with almond butter or nutella, grapefruit, cantaloupe, turkey burgers, salad, broccoli slaw, spaghetti squash, coffee with creamer, popcorn, animal crackers, Vitatop vitamin muffin, green beans, chicken. My indulgences were pizza at church on Wednesday and a couple pieces of candy in a moment of weakness on Tuesday night. Need to improve: The night time snacking is my biggest struggle right now. Once the kids go to bed, I want to mindlessly eat. I've turned to popcorn most nights and I'm ok with that as a choice. I just want to work through the behavior so that I only snack occassionally and only eat if I'm actually hungry.

During recess one day in grade two, I remember sitting atop a snowy hill and sneering to my friend, “Ugh, I hate that Amy girl. I’ve never liked her—never have and never will.” My friend nodded, shrugged with indifference, and then gobbled up another fistful of snow before the bell rang. She, no doubt, returned to class feeling normal, if slightly over-hydrated. I, however, felt powerful, even menacing, in a way only gossiping can beget. I’d torn someone down, built myself up and escaped reprimand all before lunch. I was unstoppable! I was unconquerable! I was untouchable! I was in trouble.

Some so motivated by the agenda-makers they simply can no longer listen to or indeed see reason, they charge blind at a given enemy whilst the real villain rides past with impunity. Good god what an age we live in when even the common man has no bond, when all we have left are the years of our fathers because the present is so intolerably awful, we reach out to the past because they have given us no future, we tell tales of a better age because this one shames us, makes of us victims, hunted and prey. Better days then, no crime upon the street ,women walked unmolested and the little ones played in peace, the police served the people and neighbourliness existed, not as a ghost, a phantom, not as a spectre, conjured up in tales told by the aged, front-doors left open and a better world, a kinder world, a peoples world.

Garlic is one of my favorite things. I put it in everything. Usually if a recipe says to put 3 cloves of garlic in, I'm pretty sure they really mean 6-7 cloves so that's what I do. This giant garlic bulb made my day. I ended up roasting it and putting it in some roasted garlic and sage bread that I made. Delicious. I realized a couple of years ago that I'd never actually had fresh garlic before. When it's newly picked, it's so juicy and crisp, it's incredible. I think we're going to try and grow some of our own garlic for next year because I get so excited about it. I can't wait!

In 30 states — including Arizona, California, Idaho and Utah — the LDS Church showed the largest percentage gains of any Christian group, Jones noted. Of course, many of these states — Rhode Island, Connecticut and Mississippi, for instance — have relatively tiny Mormon populations, so adding even a small number of members can produce a large jump in percentages.

In the meantime, a new controversy has developed over a change in the charity tax relief. The government plans would mean that from 2013/14 wealthy donors to charities would no longer be able to give to charities in order to get tax relief and get their tax rate down; effectively an ‘opt out’ of paying their tax. Labour have taken this opportunity to champion the concerns of the charities to tell the government to maintain the current status quo which currently sees nearly 10% of those with income over £10million paying less than 20% tax (more than half of those were below 10%), and further, fewer than ¾ paying over 40% tax. Considering the amount of money these individuals earn this is an incredible amount of money not paid in tax due to the ability for these individuals to pay money to a charity and effectively ‘opt out’ of tax payments.

Police could have used the law to arrest activists, journalists, and passersby for recording protests and other events.

I made one with gold edging to mirror the gold in the cup, but wasn't thrilled with it. I'm also not thrilled with the placement or color of the sentiment. This card definitely is not finished. For now, though, I've given it all the time I can and must move on. :)

My artist date was my art group this week. I know that's 'wrong' because you're meant to do it alone but I really wanted to do that for my date. I wanted to look at other work and ask questions and be asked and inspired. It was a HUGE hurdle for me and I'm proud of myself. Even if it had been awful I would have been proud.
It isn’t uncommon, in the wake of a disaster, for aid to take a while to reach those who need it. There is always footage of some angry resident complaining that promised aid has not arrived. However in the prevailing culture of Port-au-Prince, dissatisfaction of this kind swiftly leads to violence. This is a problem that needs fixing fast, or there will be a lot of very cross Haitians, who have over the years repeatedly demonstrated a penchant for angry mobs and violent protest.
Duggan Veterinary Supplies will also be launching a large animal brochure over the coming months.
Unocal – which led a consortium of companies from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Japan and South Korea – has maintained the project is both economically and technically feasible once Afghan stability was secured.
And except for a small snafu, in which she was very nearly hit by a yellow VW bug during mile 1 (she insists she wasn’t actually hit by the wayward car, but I disagree- the crazy person basically turned her car into her), we did just fine.
I have so many half written posts.
We can only conclude that late spring is when Panetones reproduce. Just before Christmas is a bit like peak lambing season for these things. Panetones seem to have an asexual reproductive mode, budding off in the manner of garlic or daffodils.
“Ohh oooh.” Tears started to fill my eyes.
In that vein, we go over all the assignments and work and tests that come home. We go through what they did well - where they remembered some of the lessons they're being taught or where they did their best handwriting or where I can see that they checked their work and erased a wrong answer. And then we go through the parts that the teacher marked wrong to ensure that the wee ones understood what was done incorrectly.

In deference to those who haven’t seen it, I don’t want to spoil too much of CitW’s plot. Instead, I’ll say this: CitW is one of those meta-exercises that unabashedly critiques horror movies, the people who make them, and their audiences. It’s not afraid to do a little moralizing, either. The basic lesson of CitW can be summed up in this exchange:
I pondered telling my husband but knew he would chide me for being so silly. So I told the cat. She rolled her eyes and turned her back on me, thus confirming that she believes all humans to be weak and inferior. This is a kitten who charges at things she’s scared of. Maybe I should be more like her.

It's hard to think of Christmas when the weather is warm, we in Northern California are experiencing a very warm early winter. The rain we normally see this time of the year is traveling up an over us. Christmas day is supposed to be sunny and warm. I was humming "It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas" as I put up my tiny village....At least inside my home it's Christmas!
Since becoming pregnant, I’ve been plagued almost non-stop with a multitude of unpleasant symptoms. These symptoms forced me to adapt my schedule and sacrifice my precious morning time with God. I still found ways to sneak in time with Him, but for me, it hasn’t felt the same.
It felt good to just look out at the water, stick my feet in the sand and watch the kids skip stones. Thank you Kevin for knowing just what I needed even if I didn't.
What is a free radical and what difference does it make in your life? Free radicals are active molecules which are missing an ion. That missing ion must be replaced and the molecule will do all in its power to grab the first one it can find. They are all around you. You can quickly see the damage it does by cutting an apple and putting a slice on a table. It will soon turn dark. That darkness is free radical damage. The same kind of damage can be seen when you look at anything that is rusted. The rust is the action of free radicals. The scary part is that it is going on in your body every minute of every day.
Which is I guess what interests me about HOTBIRD's rebirth. Understand, that for me HOT BIRD means as much as a manhole cover. Even though I've gone on at length about all manner of things destroyed and discarded, even the DKNY sign with the NY Skyline that used to be on Houston in the Soho, ironically.
When I was 3 my Dad took a job that meant he would work away from home on a fortnightly roster. I guess essentially that means that for the last 28 years of my life he has only been around for half of the parenting. For the first 10 years of his career our family consisted of myself, my younger brother, my dear mother and dad.

No bedtimes. No bedtimes helps because in the night sometimes I can do things I couldn't do in the day, such as playing outside in the dark, using a flashlight and having it work; and last but not least and best, at night, everything looks just so calm, peaceful, and nice, especially out in nature, just like it's supposed to be.

From what was once a total of over 100 councillors, the BNP now only has a meagre 9. And from having been in credit to the sum of some £2.3 million, the Party is said have debts of £700 000. Sad to say, back as far as the autumn of 2006, I saw that there were problems which eventually led to the difficulties that are now besetting the Party and that have resulted in its regression.
She had a fantastic time. I was sad we had to limit the attendance, to tell you the truth, because I honestly think she could have had 20 girls there dancing with her, and she would have been in complete bliss.

For all of you eagerly waiting to hear...the radiation did what it was supposed to do (besides give me "the exhaustion!)...the brain tumors shrunk in size. They did discover a very minute spot in the area of the tumor they removed in March, but are not going to worry about that at this time. I'm not exactly a candidate for the gamma knife treatment, although it might be an option.
I have a major issue with being touched unnecessarily. Most people I know somehow also know not to touch me (it could be the fact that they’re scared I might snap one of their bones if they come too close but I haven’t had that confirmed). Unless they’re going to give me a back rub or massage my neck, then hell, that’s a free for all.

Well, what with my world being consumed with mountainous mammories, sweet milky breathed cuddles, a dear hearted little lass serenading her wee brother with exuberant renditions of Feliz Navidad at a decibel level one or two notches above loud....while he sleeps!, the stockings were the only item that found it's way out of my craft cupboard.

The story goes that after the accident, his co-workers pulled his body to shore. The young man’s employer contacted his father, who then rushed down from Maine. However, the father took his son’s $300 in wages and left the body where it lay on the ground under a blanket. The men Charles had worked with buried him on the river bank and carved his name into a stone*.
We just cleaned it up and left the peeling paint finish alone for the time being.
It's a bad enough headline in itself, but it becomes even more grim when you realise that this story, this new 'evidence', worthy of a front page headline no less, is based entirely on the claims of a single psychic. Yes, you read that right, a national newspaper has given over its front page to the wild claims of a psychic investigator.
So live in love, and live in happiness. Not in the way that people tell you to, not how society’s social rules tell you to. Don’t conform, but rather live in the way that you feel is right. Listen to your heart. Be open – Ephathatha. And be happy.
When I was over at a friends house looking at her baby's nursery I saw in the closet clothing size dividers. She told me she got them at Babies R Us for $10- so I checked...sold out in blue AND green. Well, not to be discouraged I figured it was something I could make myself on the cheap- and I did! I picked up my supplies- blank closet size dividers (eBay seller, $5 for 20 of them plus free shipping!), scrapbook paper (5 for $1), vinyl sheet for the letters (already on hand), Mod Podge, some scrap cardboard, and a foam brush.

Phase 2 “reduce your quince poaching liquid”…
Eliza has had her hair cut for the first time in over three years. It ends her quest to grow it down to her bottom and came as she gave way to frustration at how tangled it got and the time she had to spend brushing it to keep it tidy. Taken by L to a hairdresser for the occasion, she also seemed to enjoy the attention. It now ends below her shoulders, long enough still for a pony tail.
33. People who aren’t prejudiced against dobermans are awesome. That includes the sheriff that picked up our runaway dog, and the humane society that adopted him for a couple days. The little brat got to follow the workers around the office for two days. He was their pet. I was so ecstatically relieved when I called them and found out he was there. We brought them flowers. Evidently no one ever brings them flowers. They all got a little teary eyed. The entire office had to come look at the flowers. We got them potted chrysanthemums, so they can have them around for awhile. We are going to bring Mauler Mulligan back for a Yule visit with a santa hat on, and bring a little sack of goodies off the Humane Society’s wishlist.
Today I had the day off from my "paid" job which gave me a little time to work at my "unpaid" job. (Laundry, vacuuming, cleaning--you know the drill...) I also took the opportunity to tackle a small project in my kitchen.
Some time ago, I found THIS baby pattern on the blog of an online friend which was translated from the original Portuguese. I planned on making the sweater but had no baby to make it for. So I thought about it and wondered how it would look in an adult size. So I found a pound of mill ends in a craft store, upped the hook size to a J and decided to give it a try. This is the result.......
No one likes to feel like the slow one. No one likes to feel left behind. It’s not unfair that this was the way it was, but that doesn’t mean it felt great.

Nothing could have prepared me for the searing pain I began to feel as Jack lifts me up by my under arms and sets me on the banister. So many ribs are broken or shattered that it feels like the rest is just dangling; waiting to fall.

3. Make a list - I find this especially helpful. Make a list of everything you want to get done during the day, then cross off tasks as you complete them. If you do something that isn't on the list, write it down and then cross it off. Trust me, it'll make you feel like you're really accomplishing stuff. Make sure to add all ordinary things like brushing your teeth, going to the bathroom, and drinking a cup of coffee to the list.
These are my regular customers, twice a day they line up and watch me fill their dog bowls, once filled they each go to their respective spots and wait for me to place the bowl down. We each have a routine before I put the bowl down, Presley sits and waits until I tell her o.k. and then she gets a big hug, Cody runs to his red carpet, sits and waits for me to give him a big kiss and scratch his chin and Sparky speaks and spins then sits and waits for a kiss.

I read many of the beer blogs and do see that among beer enthusiasts in the UK there is a point of view that brewers & pubs are some sort of charity case and people need to be encouraged to go out and spend their money supporting them. The stats speak for themselves, pubs and beer are declining and for want of a better term “craft” micro brewers are bucking the trend and growing. The growth of these small outfits in no way matches the overall decline but heh ho.
Preheat the oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. bake until golden brown around the edges but still light in the center, about 8 minutes. Removed from the oven and let cool 10 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to racks to cool completely.

So things are moving along in the basement, slowly. Lots of cleanup has been going on... old electrical, alarm wires, plumbing - all cleaned up, made more efficient, moved out of the way. We also moved the hot water tank into the storage are and and took the opportunity to switch it from electric to more efficient gas. Surprisingly, since we were renting the tank from Direct Energy, making the switch (moving the tank, getting the new unit, drilling for the external vent) was free!
Karl: you’re not concerned about
The other issue is traffic. When I get an intern from SDSU or "down south," as we say here in San Diego, she often don't realize what commuting during rush hour will do to her day. Add on the cost of gas in this day and age and the fact that most interns aren't driving a Nissan Leaf, and you get an even greater burden.
Also, this should go without saying, but be kind to each other in the comments. Disagreeing with others is fine, but I simply won't tolerate bashing, from either side of the equation.

The Swami shortly noticed that the abstract philosophy didn’t go down well with a large part of the audience. He, therefore, changed gear and dwelt upon the humorous angle of names. Names, he said, are highly deceptive in this world of illusion. To begin with, a man named Amir Lal suffers all his life juggling to make both ends meet. A Collector Singh lacks the power to discipline even his errant son. Vidyasagar happens to be the name of a guy who has long retired hurt after struggling with alphabets in vain. Nayan Sukh is the label given to someone afflicted by congenital blindness. And so on and so forth.

Although quite stressful at times, I'm having a lot of fun. I wake up every morning and look up to the stunning green alps that technically belong to Austria. I'm living in a village of about 50 people called Baad in the Kleinwasertal, which is a funny area in that it's a part of Austria but only accessible from the Germany side due to the towering Alps blocking any sort of road. I'm leaning German slowly and understand more than I speak, but it can be frustrating being the only teacher/instructor there that only speaks English. My Vietnamese has not helped me one bit.

These are some pics from the 110 camera my boyfriend's stepdad lent me. The macro is just amazing on it. It's only a little cam, doesn't weigh much and he picked it up to take happy snaps while visiting San Fran in the 70s. But it still takes perfect pics and it's got some great features.

My balloon image is from the "party this way" set. I stamped the balloons and then used embossing powder to make them stand out a bit. I stamped the party this way arrow, cut it out and placed it over a punched circle.
Anyway, I also voted for the challenger to my current Congress critter. The current guy has run unopposed in every election (barring primaries) since I have been able to vote. I've been wanting to pry his RINO, insider trading ass out of that seat for as long as I've been aware of him. Maybe this will be the year, but I'm not all that hopeful.
At 8:15 my doctor came in and checked me. I was still 4cm so she went ahead and broke my water and started Pitocin. That drug is mean! It really really really jump started things. My doctor predicted I'd have him before noon. Not even 5 minutes after my doctor left I could feel my left leg. I buzzed the nurse and she hit the bluster button on my epi pump. She told me she lay a certain way and she would come check me in 5 minutes. Well it didnt work I could still feel my left leg. I was also feeling a lot of pressure and it hurt!!! She decided to check me at 8:30 and I was 6cm and a 0 station. I went from 4 cm to 6 cm in 20 minutes after Pitocin was started. I could still feel my left leg so my nurse hit the bluster button again and decided to call anesthesia so come look at me. At 9:00 I was in a lot of pain. My left leg was STILL not not numb and I was hurting! I was feeling contractions and they hurt. I called my nurse and she checked me again I was 9cm. She told me to get ready I was going to be having him soon! Everything was happening so quickly. My nerves started to kick in and I started to cry. Am I ready ready to hold another baby? I was just so scared. Can I do this with no drugs again? My nurse was so nice. She knew our story and had read our blog. She calmed me down and told me she was there to help me. I am so thankful for her she was so sweet.
“No, no,” said the latter; “come in here.” He led the way back into his room, and struck a match to light the candles on his chimney. Their dim rays fell upon the disorder his packing had left. “You must excuse the look of things,” he said. “The fact is, I’m just going away. I’m going to Rome at seven o’clock.”
A little girl asked her Mom, "Mom, may I take the dog for a walk around the block?"
I get up the next morning and peer out my door. I’ve decided that I’m going to peek and shout to announce my presence before going through any doors or around corners. It’ll be a pain, but it’s better than having to see that again. I’m convinced I’ll be scarred for life, like that kid at school that caught his parents doing it on his four-wheeler. Now he won’t ride it anymore and he wears dark sunglasses all the time. I’ll probably have to move in with my grandma if it gets too awkward. That thought cheers me up a bit though because she has better snacks at her house.
And then she comes home for a visit. Something happens inside my brain, and MJ moves from the "MJ's responsibility" compartment to the "My responsibility" compartment.
Third Quarter: MLB
Not sure how many of you faithful blog readers knew, but I once again retook the Praxis exam on March 10, 2012. It was a quiet day, and has been a quiet time leading up to this exam that will set me free from my college education. A week before the Praxis I had dreamt that I had over slept and missed the exam. As I awoke to complete panic I soon realized that I still had one more week before the exam. Once again, the very next night, I had another dream to which I woke up very discouraged. I had dreamt that I had (at least) made it to my exam, but was given the results that I did not pass (once again). I decided to push these thoughts aside and continue to not think, or care about the upcoming Praxis I would take again for a third time. The Saturday of the 10th arrived, and I carelessly went and took my test. With only minutes until the timer went off I managed to finish the test before time was called. Time was called and I turned in the exam, and walked away with a thought that I don't care. Whatever happens will happen. This third time around I had been telling people (if the topic of my test came up - and was rarely brought up by me) I was not studying, and I was not going to use any religion. Last time I had studied, and used all that religious stuff to only get me a score that was worse then the first time I took the test. Now please don't misunderstand the "no religion" bit. During this time of much trial (as I see my life right now - to which some of you are probably thinking, "Gee's Libby, it's a test get over it!" Believe me, I wish I could...) I have turned to a wonderful talk that came out just before I left on mission many years ago. The talk was give by one of my favorite apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Elder Oaks. The talk entitled, "Timing" has made me realize that I am NOT in control AT ALL!

This film is essentially a remake of 1932′s Red Dust – and the film-makers obviously thought that the only man who could reprise Clark Gable’s role from the original was Gable himself – because he is the star of both films. Gable plays Victor Marswell, a big game hunter in Kenya. When earthy, sexy Eloise Kelly (Ava Gardner) arrives, the couple have a brief relationship. Things change when Donald and Linda Nordley (Donald Sinden and Grace Kelly) come to stay, Victor falls for Linda – and the feeling seems mutual…

While we agree with Byskov et al. that our work represents a radical departure from the age-old dogma that mammalian females permanently lose the capacity for oocyte and follicle production during the perinatal period, careful examination of all of the available data leaves no doubt that adult female mammals retain the capacity for oogenesis and folliculogenesis.

He was, at the time, a deeply unhappy man, a subtle, sensitive person questioning many of the fundamental certainties on which his life had been based, and this had fatal consequences for his control over the mob we were. He was the teacher, the enemy, and we sensed his weakness, judged him accordingly, and there was little he could do to reverse this instinctive implacable judgement of failure. He was like a poker player holding a pair of deuces whose opponents were well aware of what he held in his hand – bluffing was useless.

Even in the best-edited book I would expect to find one error, even if it’s only an extra space or an infelicitous repeated word, every couple of pages. Proofreading is really not a luxury extra. Authors, demand that your publishers provide it!
I won’t hold my breath for either.
My goal has been to lose just one pound a week. Now, I realize that being a bigger girl that my body is capable of losing more than one pound a week. However, in the past I have lost a considerable amount of weight in a short period of time - only to gain it all back. My approach this time around isn't necessarily just for weight loss, but simply making healthy changes for the better - when I can, where I can.

Enough of this – if you’ve read this far I’m impressed by your stamina. Thanks to all DMT people for a great experience the last few months – I’ve learnt a lot this semester and am hoping to build on it and learn more web design, particularly HTML 5. I’m nowhere near to being classed as even the shadow of a qualified geek yet, but am starting to think that this could be possible. Maybe.
There are numerous other references to the Chaldeans in the Old Testament scriptures, but the following verse is the last mention of them:
Blog about what you love. If you blog about who you are, what you love, and what you know it will show in your blog. I don't try to stretch this blog to be something that it's not. For example, every so often I try and post about something "deep" however it's been a while since my last really thought-provoking post. Though this bothers me some, I also know that if I tried to force myself to add one of these posts when I can't really think of a good topic, it would be uninspired and not fun to read.
Please be sure to check out their blog HERE - the talent there is AMAZING!! Thanks again for choosing me for a Guest Designer spot this month ladies - I am tickled!!! :)
One of our major pivot points happened soon after we had won the competition and we acquired a new contract with a school. Most of the previous inventory that we purchased had been ‘used’, and we were able to buy at a very discounted price. But for this new school and for growing at the rate we planned to, we knew that we had to get financing and restructure our procurement and growth processes a little bit. We needed the ability to purchase more expensive new units. Again, being part of Cupid’s Cup was very influential with this because of their partnership with BB&T. Through these connections, we were able to acquire a loan at a very low rate, and now have a solid business plan and financial model in place for any new school we happen to form an agreement with.

Auntie Joan came in with a tray. It wasn’t like the painted metal one they had at home with the scratched old roses on it; this was a long wooden tray, with high raised sides, and holes cut in each end for handles. On it were three tall glasses of milk. Carol didn’t like milk, she’d never drink it, not even when Mum heated it up in the milk pan and put sugar in it. Susan wondered if she should say something, explain how Mum had written a letter to school, excusing Carol from the morning milk. She watched Carol wriggling in her seat, she noticed how even Rachel had stopped rolling her socks, waiting to see what would happen.
If we could convict them for being insensitive douchebags, this would be an open and shut case.
So, anyway, to encourage her readers to leave comments, Katie offered a giveaway for a barbecue cookbook by one of her favorite cookbook authors, French chef and resturanteur Stéphane Reynaud. The book is entitled Stephane Reynaud's Barbecue. Katie drew my name out of the hat, and I won the cookbook! Now, mind you, my cookbook was making its way to me via Australia, Katie's native land. (So it had a prettier cover than the American version!) And it took its time getting here from down undah, but finally, my cookbook arrived last week, complete with a few extra GORGEOUS Australian gourmet cooking magazines that Katie threw in, for fun. (She's a featured contributor to the Australian gourmet food magazine, "Delicious", you know!)
Today Libya has fallen, how the Libyans would benefit from it only time would tell but one thing is sure that US and her allies have formed a bridgehead in Africa. Further deployment of the US troops in Africa are taking place, its China encirclement there where China has friends in the Muslim countries. Sudan has been split, and Obama plans to occupy some other countries like Uganda, Somalia, Morocco etc.

How do you know when a person in a position of authority or power is lying to you? Their lips move, or their typing fingers or their TV ads. Sometimes people lie to you by telling the truth. Several years ago, when trans-fats were the cause-du-jour, I walked into my supermart and immediately noticed a large product display with red printing on the packages and the banner above them. It said, “Now With No Trans-Fats”. I instantly knew that I had just been lied to, twice! The product was Nestle’s 24-packs of bottled water. Of course it had no trans-fats. It never did, but, “Now with no trans-fats” says, not only that it did, at one point, but that the company has taken steps to remove it for your safety. Aren’t we a great company? Buy our safe products!

My goal for the week: finish the new beginning and connect up to the previous beginning. It'll take a bit of rewriting, since I made a few setting and story changes, but I hope it'll be even stronger.
“and I talk about it being the operator’s manual of America. It’s how America works. It’s the “how” of America. But there’s another document equally important, which is the “why” of America, and that’s the Declaration of Independence. And in that Declaration is these words, ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.’”

So you guys like Amagami? here you have it… am I to speak more of it….? no… its just Amagami with different characters but essentially with the same formula and that Shigeru is not like Junichi who was “dumped” on Christmas day… instead he accidentally “aimed” to get dated on the said day and or a confession also on the said same day there you have it a guy who won the Amagami challenge somewhat cleanly… so yes Amagami with Ero content enjoy.

When my sister and only sibling, Elizabeth, died from a brain tumour at the age of 29 in August 1987, I found myself turning to poetry for succour, consolation and a deeper view of things. I called on Keats, Coleridge, Wordsworth and other English Romantic poets; I visited Lorca, Levertov and RS Thomas. I also began walking more and more, and further and further. In the simple act of walking, in the natural human activity of placing one foot in front of the other, I encountered a kind of fragile peace; and the sublime scenery I often walked through seemed to provide, at least partly, a benign and numinous response to my unanswerable questions.
While stuff like "I love you all" written with blood on the walls and you hanging in the foreground does have a great effect on people (especially for the ones who find you) and will instantly make them feel sorry for your ass, you should know that it's already becoming a cliché.

Josh Matthews interviews Mr. McMahon. He wants to know if CM Punk signed the contract, the answer was no. In fact, when Vince went into Punk’s locker room, Punk told him to get out. This is John Cena’s fault for insisting on this match, and if he doesn’t win, than have mercy on his soul.

A Franzenian footnote: On Monday I was in London, and the Tube was mostly shut down due to striking. During my train journey home, I read that Jonathan Franzen had accidentally wandered into the Tube shut-down when his chauffeured car hadn’t shown up. There was something about the congruence of me and Jonathan Franzen – both affected by the strike; both out walking the London streets – that just amused me. Without a doubt, the freedom of workers to strike adversely affects the freedom of commuters to get around the crowded city. And yet, compared to the sardine tin of the Tube, it really did feel liberating to stride down Oxford Street!

Fat burning has become a popular catch phrase in marketing classes at the gym and exercise videos. Most people who are seduced by the idea of burning fat just want to lose weight or tone their bodies. When it comes to weight loss it really doesn’t matter if your body is burning fat or carbs: what matters is that you are burning more calories than you consume. About.com exercise guide Paige Waehner recommends that you exercise consistently and vary your workout routine if your goal is to burn fat. Yoga can be an effective part of both these strategies.

The plumber arrived early on Sunday morning to survey the damage. He confirmed that the central heating system had exploded (it didn't actually take a plumber to work that out, once we had established that the world wasn't ending, and the house wasn't falling down). and set about mending it. I was quite impressed - I'd been all set with a second possible house lined up in the town, but he actually dealt with it quite quickly and we all crashed into bed for a lunchtime nap to make up for being up half of the night.

Today, my feet are soft and sheltered from the elements, but my mind still races down the path toward the creek as though it was yesterday. I see the curved beech tree and hook my small fingers around it, then leap forward and land with a splash into the cool water.

Girls are usually stuck on the sidelines, watching their brothers play, but Averil & the Fellows felt passionately that girls should be able to get in the game. So they convinced 9 of the 11 school owners to just give it a chance. By the end of the first tournament, even Reshma Lohia, the most outspoken opponent of the league, was cheering her heart out on the sidelines, buying new cricket equipment for her schools and planning for the next round. The kids were on fire to play, school spirit had never been higher, the students, teachers and community came out to watch the games on Sunday afternoons, and boys and girls were getting up at the crack of dawn to get to practice on time.

Which brings me to my current situation. Years of enthusiastic seed starting have left me with a large zip-lock bag full of extra seeds. They fill a whole crisper drawer in my fridge, and have for years. Last year I made a huge effort to scatter sow many of the easy growing flower varieties. As a result I had a huge cutting garden of zinnias, cosmos and calendulas. I still have a large quantity of seeds however, and wrestle with the temptation to order more. Of course I need to at least pick up some zinnias since I adored them last year and now I have no more zinnia seeds!

We feel compassion for others because we empathize with them, and can place ourselves in the position of another. Whether or not this empathy comes from God is irrelevant, because whether or not we believe in the existence of God, the capacity for empathy exists within us. The brand of Christianity in which I was raised denied that animals have souls, though countless examples of kindness and selflessness exist in the animal kingdom. How can these creatures exhibit what we define as goodness without benefit of a soul or Sunday school teachings?

I arrived at Clause to find Vernon and another friend already settled at the bottom of the stairs with a bottle of cheap white wine. Ready for a quick exit (I hoped). Apparently the wine was free, which explained Vernon's insistence on the venue. With the alternative overpriced bottled beer I poured a large glass. Immediate thoughts were that it would blend into the image of many bars that I have reluctantly agreed to meet friends in over the years (while dreaming of a decent pub). I'll however have no trouble remembering it. Within an hour we had witnessed the same person fall from his chair three times, attempt a Haka, grab a female member of staff and finally exchange words with Vernon for repeatedly kicking his chair. At 6:30pm this is never a good sign, nor is the apparent blindness of the staff to his state.

Good luck to everyone back home (on finals & then surviving senior week for those of you participating). I am really excited to get back home just so i can see everyone, but I also don’t ever want to leave Sydney. I can’t really explain the feeling. I wish I could just pick up all my friends from back home & teleport them right to Sydney Harbour. That would be the best case scenario. Unfortunately that won’t be happening, but a girl can dream.

To break the domination of upper castes, it became necessary to introduce affirmative action for and positive discrimination of Dalits, as part of the policy of the government. But implementing positive discrimination has not been an easy task and many seats reserved exclusively for Dalits still remain vacant, again because of the shrewd manipulations of the dominating castes.
Recently, I was talking to my rents, and they are thinking that they may want my car, but in replacement get me a similiar, newer car...I am all for this idea, or I was anyways. Lately I have been noticing alot of door dings on my car, I hit the car a couple of times (mostly my fault), and someone hit me. Last week, I was careless not paying attention and bumped into a car infront of me, in the DRIVE THRU. Luckily, the gentleman was so nice and understanding, there was no damage on his car, and well mine I haven't fixed it yet from the previous time. The other night, I was in a parking lot and once again a car was backing up and just touched my car, there was no damage just a couple of scratches. A car is a car, it is suppose to take you from point A to point B, but I have just been feeling that I am such a bad driver and do not deserve a newer car. It really got to me, and I have been meaning to express it because I take it personally. I started realizing, that its not my car, its not me (well sometimes) but it may in fact bethat I tend to drive alot. I am usually at the mall or a coffee shop where there are cars flying through. I want a newer car, but I am also ok with this car.

I heard a story of an old Cajun family that lived way back in the Neches River bottom. This was in recent times, but these stories and these abilities went way back in his family, and one of these stories is that these haints would give you the ability to predict the future, and this man claimed that he could predict the very day that a woman was gonna have her child or the very day that a cow would have her calf. And the way he did this is he would look in the sky, and the haint would appear, and it would look kinda like a luminous cloud and it would tell him what was gonna happen.
You would naturally espect that countries like Italy and Spain, with their soft-centred atheist anarchist cosmopolitan populations, would soon fall for this sort of protesting. So far, Paris, home to the crunchy Frog, has not surrendered, but it is only a matter of time. Saddest of all is the news that even in Holy Pissing Ireland they have a couple of #Occupy sites. This is the sort of thing you can see and hear if you go to the one in Dublin. Is a big disgrace! I am mortified. I think.

And how is it going? Well, I've had a few frustrating days, but overall the process has been even more healing and more insightful than therapy ever was. My protagonist is me. Well, not me. But kind of. Her experiences, especially as an adult, differ greatly from mine, but her primal needs, her motivations are all me. And I've had to delve into why I do what I do. I've had to get very uncomfortable, examining me. All of the things she has done, as an adult, I can see me doing if it had not been for some divine intervention. Sometimes I wonder if I had not met my husband at 19, what would my life have looked like? And some of those imaginings are not pretty. Let's just say that if my husband had been George Bailey and he had come to see what I had become if he had never been born, he probably wouldn't recognize the woman before him. Probably would be pretty jarring, and my protagonist has done a lot of things I believe I may have done had I not met my husband at the young age that I did.
When you find yourself looking for important dollars, exactly what do you do? Are you the person who gets carefully from relatives or friends? Will you get lending products?

“We previously had services 40 and 120, running every three or four minutes. We now only have the 120, timetabled every 10 minutes. This is a joke.”
Other conflicts can arise as well. For example, in 2007, when Wilson was developing its Greenlight service, the town tripled its rate for using municipal utility poles from $5 to $15 a year. That raised the pole fee for Time Warner Cable from $82,000 to $246,000 a year, but Time Warner is still paying the old rate while it negotiates with town officials over the issue.

That being said, sometimes you have hard and fast requirements and your stakeholders truly don’t understand what they’re asking for. For example, one of my prior companies went through a rebranding process where we renamed the company and they wanted “everything” with the old name to be renamed. Of course, our internal AD domain was xyz.prv. You CAN technically rename a Windows domain, but who have you ever run into who thought that was a good idea?

Ten years of exchanging, 'Morning!' in the university carpark. The odd conversation at various annual events. There may've been one dance at a Christmas party once, or was that a dream?
I think we all edit and draft with a list of rules about where we're going and how we want to get there. Perhaps 'values' would be a better word than 'rules' in this context. If reading lists of other writers' rules gets people disagreeing and thinking about their own, that's great. Isn't comparing your own method against someone else's and comparing your own sets of words to other people's sets of words one of the ways you develop style, or voice, or whatever you want to call it?
Well worth having a look if you don't feel like watching the video or if you want more.

You are puzzled because there is a woman that you know and you like and the bad thing is, she likes someone else. Well, that is not the only bad thing, though. The guy that she likes just happens to be a total jerk to her and you just don’t get it. How is it that a good looking and fun to be around kind of a woman like that ends up with a guy who is a jerk to her? Well, it might have a little to do with the reason why women like bad boys even though they say that they want to meet a nice guy.

I can't eat,
We eat one dal (pulses) dish almost every day. Here is an earthy dal preparation using green-gram dal and brinjals. You may also choose any other vegetables that you may have handy, viz., cabbage, french beans, ridge gourd, snake gourd, potatoes, etc., with this recipe.
Introduce a system where if you step out of line or misbehave just once, you lose your monetary investment in this game for a temporary duration. You can even lose it completely, as in forever, if you step out of line three or more times (I’m unsure when a player is permanently banned…) This sort of system makes people extremely wary. And with good reason; I don’t want to spend money on a product that might be taken away from me.
Two months of going to sleep praying that someone is picking them up when they cry, that someone is feeding them when they are hungry, that someone is cuddling them close, and singing them songs, and nuzzling their sweet baby necks, and patting their soft baby backs.
I am SOOOO glad I don't have to manhandle this stiff and heavy thing through my machine any more!
So then I started thinking about this concept of bins, and how many we see when we look at the rest of the world, recognizing that the number changes depending on context. In the specific context of my reading my college glossy-mag, I think my bins are scientists and non-scientists. Within the non-scientists bin, there are many possibilities, including ballerinas, politicians, and stay-at-home moms.
Do you think the title is too much?
Chop lettuce and place in bottom of glass salad bowl (for appearance if desired). Decorate top with all other ingredients and sprinkle with tortilla chips.
When these examples are what makes people known and attracted, and this is what people – especially the young among us – want to make the example for their lives, then I believe that we are far from an ethical society, where the knowledge and insights in law and the reasons behind laws, is a guiding principle. As Yose ben Yo’ezer says it, we should focus on the Sages of our times, not on the drunkards.
The intersection between those two facts has produced a classic bubble, with wildly inflated reserve estimates bringing a torrent of cheap credit to bear on an asset that can’t support the grandiose claims made for it. Because US mineral rights laws and Wall Street’s expectations both require firms that buy shale gas rights to produce right away, irrespective of the state of the market, natural gas is now selling for a price—wobbling around $3.50 per thousand cubic feet, last I checked—that covers much less than the cost of drilling and extraction. My readers will no doubt recall real estate speculators in the midst of the bubble feverishly buying rental properties even when the rent covered only a small fraction of the mortgage payments; the logic here is exactly the same.

It’s already way past midnight and still you’re mentally wandering the streets of Oxford, unable to get this story out of your mind. Getting up, you tiptoe your way down the curving staircase, pausing briefly on the landing to stare out through the fog. It’s so thick now the streetlamp has no more power than a firefly. Entering the library, you switch on the reading lamps, pour yourself a small glass of sherry, and curl up on the velvet paisley sofa with your bare feet tucked underneath your nightgown. You pick up your book once more.... now, where were we?

My sleep cycle has been sliding further and further into a nocturnal one. Night before last I tried to go to sleep at my current hour of bedding down (2am) and found I could not get to sleep. Knowing only too well how these nights can go, I didn’t bother pretending but got up and read. At 4am I tried again with success.
One of the quotidian features of this paper is a poll that asks for the reader’s opinion on a wide variety of subjects regarding life in Lima. People can answer “yes” or “no” to the question of the day by sending a text message to the paper.

At 11:44 a.m. on a beautiful Autumn day, an invisible dome clamps down over the town of Chester’s Mill, cutting it off from the rest of the country. Law and order in the small town rapidly deteriorates, with police and town officials being the first lawbreakers. And we know something -- just not what -- is going to happen on or near Halloween. Diner chef Dale Barbara, who has a shadowy past with the military, is put in charge by the “outside” -- the president and military officials. But town officials aren’t going to give up control that easily, and Dale’s very life is in danger.
Once the certainty of a response was understood, she was allowed to ‘patrol’ what became her favourite ‘tea-spot’ in uniform. When on the ward investigating other matters, she would take time to talk to patients who had been flagged for low-level, verbal threats. She told them what she could consider doing if anyone was assaulted. She pre-empted problems. Eventually, she was allowed to move around the hospital unaccompanied by NHS staff, with a set of keys and an NHS ID badge ‘police liaison officer’. It was her ‘beat’.
I realized he wore the same clothes Eli and the other boys did. Not good. He was one of them. Although… I cocked my head, raking my gaze over him. He seemed born to wear the uniform, like he was the pattern everyone else was cut from. My eyes wandered to long, layered, blue-black hair tied at the nape by a silk ribbon. Even in dim light, his hair possessed a sheen akin to mercury.
Now the bar is on the hummer,

What did the publishers do to bring down the wrath of the Justice Department? They did nothing other than what any rational business person would do in the face of unfair pressure from an over-bearing, dominant retailer.

So many of the houses in this town continually had me saying “Wow!” It gets too difficult to look up all the names of these and all the details that go with them. That’s what gets me so behind on my blogs! LOL! Anyway, I thought I’d just share some of the photos by themselves instead. Hope you enjoy them!

The cops were chasing them through the sewers, and during one of the flame thrower shots, it was clear that they set an actual live rat on fire. Now, I don’t like rats, but that’s weak. When Tommy was set on fire, however, the crowd (Lovelock and Starkwell) gave the film a standing ovation. It’s a small crowd I know, but it was impressive nonetheless. The movie ends with a twist that isn’t really a twist wherein the neighbour kids are infected and have eaten their aunt. I guess the world will end shortly thereafter. Starkwell and Lovelock were just thankful that the movie had, in fact, ended.

I feel bad for M's mom. There was a while there that she kept finding all of M.'s pillows at the bottom of the basement stairs every morning for like 6 months. And then there were the times she'd be sat in the living room watching tv, and M (whose bedroom was on the other side of the living room wall) would start banging on the walls and screaming swear words.

I interrupt my China memoir after terrorists have slammed two commercial airliners into the World Trade Center. I have brought this baby to the safe haven of New York City, I think to myself, and now I stand on the roof of St. Francis College in Brooklyn Heights and watch the towers burn across the river. I remember looking across the river Gan in Nanchang (where my daughter was born) and thinking how anything could happen out there, how uncertain life was here and how I couldn’t wait to get back home.

“The Libyan government regards the trial of Mr Gaddafi and Mr Al-Senussi as a matter of the highest national importance, not only in bringing justice for the Libyan people but also in demonstrating that the Libyan justice system is capable of proper investigation and prosecution, and that it can conduct fair trials,” the government said in the document.
Why is the 4% number being used in articles and blog posts on bullying? Because it's convenient for those who want to downplay the bullying problem. The trouble is, it is irresponsible and misleading. When almost one-third of children are being bullied in school, there IS a crisis.

When you think of hackathons, you might think of coding, right? That’s certainly where the concept came from, but it’s taking on new meaning, as more non-profits and civic leaders embrace it as a format for social innovation.

We're probably quite late getting going with these and the tomatoes, peppers, chillis, sweetcorn, courgettes and salad leaves compared to some people, but we've found that if we plant things out too soon they get checked, and if they're kept in the greenhouse too long they get leggy and spindly.
About 7 miles from the finish, I am rolling fast (50 mph, no exag.) down a long, shady road. Because I have been alone for so long, I have had ample time to notice all kinds of things, including the fact that the QR adjuster on my front hub is sticking out, instead of being folded in. It is really kind of bothering me, cause I am OCD (obsessive-compulsive). I decide to reach down and fold it flat.

I could see myself stretched out on a metal slab. It felt like I was viewing myself from outside my body. I lay very still staring unfocused at the bright light over head. Around me the room was circular in shape, the walls and floor also made of metal gleamed under the harsh lights. A strange scent stung my nostrils a sweet antiseptic smell. I could see a shadowy form standing beside me, I struggled to see through the cloudy film that was slowly blinding me, and tried to bring the image into focus. I wanted to raise my head to get a better look, but my muscles were frozen. I lowered my gaze down to where the thing had taken hold of my wrist. He looked like he was checking my pulse. I knew there wasn’t one, my heart had stopped beating, my blood deprived of oxygen was slowly thickening, and congealing inside of me. I could just make out three long spidery fingers attached to a shrunken gray arm. The sight filled me with dread, I wanted to run, to flee from what I was seeing, but I couldn’t move. I started sobbing for the thing to get away from me, but all I could manage was weak mewing sounds. My stomach twisted into oily knots as the thing came into full view. It’s limbs were disproportional to its body. Long skinny arms stuck out of a stumpy torso. His head was oblong with over sized eyes and slits where its nose and mouth should be. The thing walked out of view, and began making shuffling sounds. When it returned it placed its long spidery fingers on my eyelid holding it open, and with a long metal instrument began scraping my eyeball.The sound unlike anything I had ever heard it made my skin crawl as I lay there listening I begged over and over in my mind, please stop.

Do not get me wrong. The special effects were quite good for the time. They still produce an interesting atmosphere even thirty years later. But at times, you get the feeling TMP is a special effects presentation created by a special effects house to land job with some Trek actors thrown in as scene breaks.

I have missed you my friends. My life took on some crazy twists and turns this last while. I had written some time ago about my friend who was diagnosed with cancer and I am happy to report the transplant went well and things are looking like they may just turn out alright. I have prayed every day and it seems as though it was not wasted.

I was nervous Monday morning, but I got out there and did it! I ran the full 5K! For me, this was a much bigger achievement than the treadmill 5K. Maybe this sounds stupid, but it felt sort of like cheating to complete my goal on a treadmill. I know that's silly, and that a 5K is a 5K no matter where you run it, but it felt a million times better to run the real distance, you know? I ran 3.1 miles, outdoors, on trails, on hills, plus I completed it a whole minute faster than on the treadmill. Here's how my laps came out:
Often, a barrel full of lawyers and a dozen prosecutors couldn't produce a tangible answer on using a firearm or other weapon for self-defense if you covered 'em all with honey and tied 'em to an ant hill. So I provide (I'm not God, your pastor, your mama, or your attorney) some things to think about in light of what my students just learned, along with the Ohio Concealed Carry Handbook, the affidavit they'll be signing when they apply for the license, and my general knowledge gained from many years of experience and reading.
It seemed that I personally prefer free-and-easy tours. Yet, group tours have their benefits as it minimises a lot of planning on my end.
I made this dish without measuring or thinking, and I really had to sit down and think hard about what I put in it, even after I'd just eaten it. You know when you get cooking, and just add a little of this, a little of that... but I'm going to try my best and share a real recipe with you!
Do they intersect much where you stand? I doubt that much has changed in this regard, even in all this time, but I wonder have they divorced further, or have they melded together? Has there been born some new balance of the two? Where we walk between them do they meld at our passing or do they simply ripple outward where they part?

Oh... poor Ashes. We've been dealing with her chewing her fur off for about 4 months now. We have treated it with steroid shots... which help, but only for a month... and we can't keep giving them to her or they can cause other issues. Because the last steroid shot has worn off, she has about a 3-inch by 2-inch patch of fur missing from the base of her tail up her backbone.
So ye, I really hope you’ll enjoy it.
Like Frank Skinner (see earlier post!), I go back further than I care to remember with Ross, and again it was at our local comedy club that he first came to my attention. As someone who has watched live comedy for over 20 years, seeing hundreds of acts in the process, Ross is probably the comedian I most admire. The vast majority of comedians turn up with the set memorised, heckler 'putdowns' written, and the jovial audience banter well scripted (and the next time they turn up you can hear it all again word-for-word!). Ross Noble however pretty much just turns up and wings it!
lynne is one amazing woman (we took to calling her The Prism, for her sage wisdom and guidance of our many colored ways); she has wisely guided and helped many of us throughout the years, urged us to go beyond our safety zone, made me sit back and think what i could do to express myself in a format that would be shared by many. the work i did - the detail, the emotion - is something that amazes me still.
