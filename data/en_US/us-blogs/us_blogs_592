In 1717 Voltaire was sent to the Bastille for a poem which he had not written, of which he did not know the author, and with the sentiment of which he did not agree. What adds to the oddity, in English eyes, of the whole transaction is that the Regent treated the affair as a sort of joke, and, so to speak, "chaffed" the supposed author of the satire "I have seen" on being about to pay a visit to a prison which he "had not seen". In 1725 Voltaire, then the literary hero of his country, was lured off from the table of a Duke, was thrashed by lackeys in the presence of their noble master, was unable to obtain either legal or honourable redress; and because he complained of this outrage, paid a second visit to the Bastille. This indeed was the last time in which he was lodged within the walls of a French gaol, but his whole life was a series of contests with arbitrary power, and nothing but his fame, his deftness, his infinite resource, and ultimately his wealth, saved him from penalties far more severe than temporary imprisonment. Moreover, the price at which Voltaire saved his property and his life was, after all, exile from France. Whoever wants to see how exceptional a phenomenon was that supremacy of law which existed in England during the eighteenth century should read such a book as Morley's Life of Diderot. The effort, lasting for twenty-two years, to get the Encyclopedie published was a struggle on the part of all the distinguished literary men in France to obtain utterance for their thoughts. It is hard to say whether the difficulties or the success of the content bear the strongest witness to the wayward arbitrariness of the French government.
There are numerous problems here, the main one being that the “debate” between intelligent design and evolution is a “scientific issue.” It’s not, and there’s really not much “reasonable doubt” about that in most quarters. Bachmann’s elevation of opinion to the level of theory–or, more appropriately, leveling of theory to opinion–also serves a clear political function, as is all too clear.

It never occurred to Nietzsche that the lust for power, with which he endows his superman, is itself an outcome of fear. Those who do not fear their neighbours see no necessity to tyrannize over them… I will not deny that, partly as a result of his teaching, the real world has become very like his nightmare, but that does not make it any the less horrible.

As I spend my time here cleaning out my dorm room for one last time I realize that this is probably my last night in Vermillion.

I took my time away, of course, but this definitely didn’t sit anywhere in the original plans. I’m almost certain I thought that I’d be a lawyer by now doing lawyer-like things.

Oh yes!! – During my childhood and youth I have probably seen more bright green grass than any possibly living average cow herd on earth… It’s bright – and green and juicy – so what? Can I eat it??

Jolenta, the Nessus barmaid who becomes part of Dr. Taltos and Baldanders's travelling troupe, serves as an example of this mind/body union. Altered by Dr. Taltos's arts, she has become a thing of beauty and of desire, but yet there is a sickness within that mutates from a metaphorical matter into a very real and visible disorder near the end of the book. Her façade has crumbled and what we see then is now related to what the astute reader might have perceived soon after the first encounter with her after her transformation.

Bad copy editing, on the other hand, introduces new errors while overlooking existing errors. Bad copy editing cites Wikipedia as a definitive source. Bad copy editing betrays cluelessness about the author's tone and style while revealing far too much about the copy editor's own limitations (and, perhaps, failed ambitions). Bad copy editing is painful. It takes time and is horribly enervating. Bad copy editing causes one to wear out pencils writing STET over and over. Stet is Latin for "let it stand," which is to say, it is a veto of a correction. But if you have to write it too many times on a manuscript you begin to think it is actually the Latin for "fuck off."

I should be thankful to Whitbread. And their desire to keep a close on competitors in certain key categories for the company.

This is simple common sense. And not just because they quite obviously are deadly to some people, although that should put any further debate to rest. The fundamental reason they should be limited is because in a free society the police should not be allowed to inflict terrible pain on citizens for any reason they choose, no matter how petty or inconsequential. If police are to be allowed to carry tasers they must be strictly controlled. At the moment, this is far more common than not:

A subfamily of the Old World Monkeys, cercopithecines range from Asia to sub-Saharan Africa and as far north as Gibraltar. Baboons, mandrills and macaques are examples of cercopithecines. According to fossil records, cercopithecines and colobines split between 12.5 and 10 million years ago. This suggests that the cheek pouch probably evolved at least 10 million years ago (Lambert & Whitham, 2001). The cheek pouch is present in all members of the cercopithecines but not in the colobines. While the exact adaptive function of the cheek pouch is unknown, numerous behavioral studies have been done on different cercopithecines to understand what the cheek pouch is selected for.

Amir suspects that Ali knows the truth about what happened to Hassan and why he is not the same anymore.

You begin to identify with many of her emotions and thoughts, the same way like you did as a young girl. In fact, this book nostalgically transported me into a world I had been familiar with during my school days. Being an ex- Bangalorean myself, having spent my childhood with many friends who followed the Islam faith made me take to Kite Strings like fish to water. The author, Andaleeb Wajid, has very effectively described a Muslim household as it exists in most homes. Her style of writing is deceivingly simple and you need to take no great effort to understand situations and emotions that keep coming up.

When he arrived at the poor girl's house she was not standing in the doorway, but instead was sitting in her little kitchen. He stopped his horse and looked into the window, through which the bright sun was shining, and saw the girl, sitting at her spinning wheel and diligently spinning. She looked up, and when she saw the prince looking in she blushed all over, closed her eyes, and continued to spin. I do not know if the thread was entirely even at this time, but she continued to spin until the prince had ridden away.

Watching the cop fall apart through gambling, drug abuse and outbursts of anger was kind of entertaining due to Cage being rather good at this type of role. Also it was interesting to see some scenes from the streets of New Orleans. However I soon lost interest in the plot if there is one and the movie just rolled by towards the end.
The expertly crafted endeavour is basically about everyone's innate desire the put back together the pieces of one's damaged childhood by utilizing the non-holistic method known as "cadaver accumulation" (the incessant collecting of body parts in order to satisfy a misguided yearning). Commencing with the sight of a young boy axing his mother in the head after she takes exception with his playing with a pornographic jigsaw puzzle, the film jumps forward forty years and lands us squarely on the palatial grounds of some Boston college. This palatialness is sullied somewhat when a lithesome coed studying on the grass of a grassy patch of grass finds her head removed without her expressed written consent by the rotating blade of a yellow chainsaw. This unlawful (at least I think it was unlawful) act of decapitation attracts the attention of the local branch of the department in charge of enforcing the law and junk, as it is just the first of many gruesome murders to besmirch this formerly serene learning facility.

Have you ever been in a photo where everyone else thinks you look great except yourself? And for some dumb reason you trust your instinct. To be honest, mostly when people say that someone looks good, they do mean it. Unless there being funny and evil to you for no damn reason. So you feel and think that you look really bad, and the girls next to you look good. And they be thinking that they don’t look good either, but that you look do. Do you get where I am going?

Where local policies contribute is property. As rent rises, so too do food prices. Supermarkets need to charge more to maintain inventory, and hawkers need to pay their stall rent.

For example, the other morning in Psychology the teacher covered sexual biology. Barely. For a fleeting second. She talked about XY and XX. Men and women. Then, for "other" developments, a couple of syndromes. She mentioned some terms, like "sex", "gender", and "gender identity" - but didn't really distinguish between them too much. Nothing about intersex or transgender. She didn't ask for input or feedback before moving on to the next topic - but I felt this insane gnawing itch to say something to highlight that it isn't always that simple, the complexities of sexual development.
My school is stuck on AR. Students are required to meet a reading goal (assessed via AR test) each month, based on their reading level. While I admit that the program has increased the amount reading taking place in our school, I’ve also seen it slowly suck the fun and love out of reading. Students pick books based on length, based on perceived AR-points-to-effort ratio. They completely avoid books without tests. They pass on recommendations for all of the reasons above. It’s frustrating. I don’t support it, but it’s the way of our school, for now.

It was another opportunity, however, for Brodsky to suggest that properly balanced oversight was missing.
“I love what this show will do for our city,” said Spanos. “”It will increase awareness and portray strong beautiful women. THere is also the true artistic power of it as well. I believe all viewers will have the same reaction that I had when I first saw the images. I was shocked, then moved, then wanted to learn even more. It’s incredibly meaningful. Also, because of the large and dramatic size and scale of the exhibit, along with the natural light and high ceilings of the gallery, it’s a perfect fit.”
So In terms of self realization, self change and transcending the mind and consciousness and all that – I believed this to be a strictly spiritual journey so to speak.

The Delgados kind of flew under the radar of most folks during their heyday. It’s a shame because they continuously progressed and evolved during their eight-year career into something truly special. Not only did they start their own influential record label, Chemikal Underground, which spawned the careers of Mogwai and Arab Strap, but they quietly released some of the most gorgeously bruised and bittersweet albums of the era. Between Peloton, The Great Eastern and Hate, this Scottish band recorded a trio of albums that will hopefully get the attention they deserve someday. The band was blessed with a knack for well-written odes to disappointment and despair and the tandem of vocalists Alun Woodward and Emma Pollock allowed the band to alternate between her stately and elegant singing and his more resigned and beaten tones. Ironically, as their music grew more orchestrated and gorgeous, their subject material and instrumental palette consisted solely of shades of grey. No one wins in these songs. No one finds true love. Everyone just drinks a bit too much and fixates on their flaws while pointing out the imperfections of others and how they let them down over and over again.

So, last year, I was going to blog about some old-school stuff we had in the house that I love so much that I will never part with them. One was a toy, another was a CD and the last was a book. This particular book is called “The Sick of Being Sick Book”. It’s one of my favorites because it’s a unique book of humor and quips about how to be sick when you’re sick. The reason this book played a big part in my life was because, well, I was always sick. I had asthma as a child and usually spent time at my Grandma’s house on sick days so my mom could still go to work. “The Sick of Being Sick Book” was one of my favorites to bring along with me and so I read it over and over and over. As I said, I was going to write about this book, a CD and a toy last year, but then the holidays hit and the three items were just sort of floating around the house. Not literally. That would be creepy.

It is quite against his nature to look at something nice to have and to hold and then walk away. Silly me, I led him into temptation over and over without realizing he would break.

He's fucking with my life. He's fucking with my boyfriend's life... I don't know what I did wrong, but he's been avoiding me for a week and then this morning I get a text message saying something shitty and telling me to take next week off. And that he'll get my boyfriend next week off too (we work for sister companies) so we can "just play house" together. Whatever the fuck that means. He says all this fucked up shit that makes no sense. He's threatening to demote me back to that company. And that if things are slow my boyfriend can go to the office and help me. Which makes no sense. He's just trying to be an asshole. And he's fucking good at it. Piece of shit. He's completely isolated me from all other employees so he can just emotionally abuse me.

But, because it was so easy and North American-like in Finland, I had quite a bit less fuel to feed my bizarro blog fire. When things are 'normal', they often aren't too exciting to write about. But, there's a new country on the horizon. One that you probably don't know much about. And one that I think might be just the thing to kick start my writing back into action. Curious, aren't you?! Well, I'm going to make you sweat it out. (And if you already know, help me keep it a mini-secret, at least for now!)
It's hard for post-Vietnam viewers to accept even a prisoner-of-war camp as legitimate fodder for fun. But in that time between World War II and the Vietnam War, all men did a stint in the armed forces. Those men and all the vets of World War I, World War II and Korea were a large part of TV land in the sixties. Those guys liked watching buddy pictures about the military. Combat, 12 O'Clock High, McHale's Navy, and Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. were watched by all those vets and their families. And, of course, the ultimate buddies-in-uniform program--though each of the buddies was in a different allied air force uniform, they were working together to defeat their common enemy--was Hogan's Heroes.

#2. As I was preparing these kits, I didn't include a lot of embellishments. I decided not to. What a mistake that was. I basically was able to stick some PP on some CS with my photos and that was about it. But the reason I didn't include them, was this. As I looked around at my supplies, it occurred to me that is use my embellies and tools in spurts. Lately, I've been sewing and using a lot if twine. Before that it was border strips and border punches. Before that it was Stickles and bling. It isn't that I can't use more of them together on one LO, I just don't. I don't use a lot of embellies on my LOs. I never have. So, something else I learned about myself this week. (Oh, and even though it is beside the point, yes, I have too many tools and embellishments anyway).

So Robin, the real reason that I’m calling this a “state level issue” is because I actually don’t have the ability to make this change all by myself right now. Really, it’s a issue that either has to be decided by the Supreme Court or else Congress has to pass new laws that make it the law of the land and then I will happily sign these laws.

Cayla has been going to daycare since November last year and she is loving that too. She is a very social little girl and really enjoys playing with the other kids, dancing, painting and joining in all other activities in the prekindy group. Her daycare centre is a great one but they have recently increase their prices from $85 to a whopping $96/day! Yes, Swedish people - $96 per day.. that is about 675 kr/day..!! Though if both parents are working you are entitled to receive 50% of that of the fees straight back to your bank account every three months.

When we prosecute parents who are trying their hardest, who make mistakes, or who misjudge a situation, we are prosecuting them for being what parents have always been: human. Not superheroes with super strength, judgment, fortitude and foresight.
The first story doesn't mention it, the second story buries deep in the last third of the text. But to those who are willing to use their brains for a split second, all it takes is a look at the entire poll to see how heavily this poll was skewed. On page #37, you will see the respondents were 46% Democrat, 29% Republican, and 4% Independent. 20% are too stupid to know what they are.

I just wanted to pop in let everyone know about Nathan's MRI. He had another one done on June 11. We received the results from the neurosurgeon on the 17th. The abscess went from 2.3cm to 1.7! This was very good news. I will admit I was hoping that it was a lot smaller (preferably gone) but it is going in the right direction so we're thankful. They did notice that the fluid collecting on another part of his brain has gotten larger since the last MRI. If it continues to get bigger, they will most likely drain it. He has another MRI scheduled for July 16 and we will get the results on the 20th. I am a bit discouraged that we are dealing with something new. It seems when we get past one thing, there's something new to deal with. However, I am trying not to focus on that. There is so much to be thankful for that it's definitely not productive to focus on the negative.
It was evident to me that we needed an early lunch break. Tired, hungry kids aren't at their best for learning. We finished the lessons they'd been working on and prepared to go downstairs to the kitchen. First though, I called everyone in for a group hug.

My role, I’ve come to learn, is to provide love, comfort and support – but no question, it’s hard.

I haven't seen the second movie but the third begins with Kelly and another guard bring a prisoner to a holding cell. The prisoner falls asleep in the holding cell and dreams that guard Kelly is a prisoner who is taken to the guard house where she is stripped naked and bent over a horse for twenty strokes with a cane that looks and sounds like a hollow plastic pipe. Next, the prisoner dreams that Kelly is bound to an overhead beam and whipped with the same belt that was used in the first movie. I don't find this scene with Kelly being whipped naked as hot as the scene in the first movie where she is whipped topless. I also don't like the camera work in this scene because there are too many closeups of her chest while she is being whipped; I would have preferred a longer shot.

But whatever, I know that it can never live up to the flawlessness of this nugget of heart-tugging pop gold.
The latest EP from the Chicago garage-rock duo features three tracks of more of the frenetic fuzzy guitars, pounding drums, and raw energy that siblings Alex and Francis White have become known for. “Toxic Sugar” in particular stands out with its kinetically riffs and the back-and-forth interplay between Alex’s guitar and Francis’s drums. The blaring haze of guitar-fuzz sometimes drowns out the vocals, but the tracks are just as energetic and raucous as ever.
So I devised a plan. A scheme really, that involves cookies.

I'm proud to announce that my bribe to make them cookies if they finished a project has been successful, and we're launching a project in January after several months of hard work. I've reduced them to children. Bravo me.

He brought me to his apartment which looked almost empty except for a few modern furniture and a large glass window. The ghost-white drapes were opened and the night scenery was beautiful. It brought a different feeling to the whiteness that filled the room. The lighting was orange and it felt strangely warm, calming and safe. I looked at the piece of wall covered with mirrors which reflected the image of the night scenery. It made the apartment seemed longer and larger than it already was and, in a way, a little intimidating.
It's impossible to know exactly how many men were forced onto boats along New York's port, as the victims were frequently drunk, thrown onto boats that embarked on long voyages and then failed to press charges when they returned.

American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion.

Pleasant View, Utah (population 7,482): The city has hired a new chief administrator, according to the Standard-Examiner. At a recent special meeting, council members approved, with a 4-1 vote, an employment agreement for Melinda Brimhall to take on the duties of city administrator. Brimhall’s contract with the city began Feb. 8. Her salary is $78,000 a year, with benefits that include three weeks of vacation, sick leave and holiday leave. She also will receive health and retirement benefits and a travel allowance of $300 per month, using her own vehicle. The city administrator position will be evaluated annually. Mayor Doug Clifford said the city is happy to have Brimhall on board. The previous city administrator, J.J. Allen, accepted a job with the city of Clearfield, necessitating the new hire. Brimhall grew up in Utah County and graduated from Weber State University with a double major, earning degrees in psychology and criminal justice. She also has a master’s degree in administration from Brigham Young University. Brimhall is coming to Pleasant View from Grand County where she worked as council administrator for two years. Before that, she was was a management analyst for three years in Casa Grande, Ariz., and a management assistant in Chandler, Ariz., for three years. Brimhall said she has family in Pleasant View and is pleased to start working in the area. When she is not working, she enjoys spending time with family and her puppy, Flynn. She also enjoys biking and other outdoor activities. Brimhall was sworn into office Tuesday night by Judge Patrick Lambert.

Apparently mildly insulting The Pope in song warrants death threats now – Protestant pastor Clemens Bittlinger is also a musician and well, his latest song didn’t go over too well with The Pope so now he needs armed protection to avoid the Catholic fatwa against him.

I identify most with Taylor. He is a cynic tired of the social trappings of man. He is a loner who considers himself to not be a part of any group. That is the primary reason he chooses to go on the deep space mission from which he will never return. Not only is the trip as far away from humanity as he can possibly get, there is a certain amount off peace in his voice as he records his suspended animation has lasted seven hundred years, so everyone he ever loathed back home is long since dead. Taylor never changes his attitude. When he first meets the mute human population, his first instinct is to gloat over how easy they will be to rule. Even onnce he is captured and treated like an animal, he feels no sympathy for his fellow humans. His only interest is in Nova. One gathers his interest in her is little more than carnal. Of course, the final scene displays his disdain for humanity in all its ugly glory.

Over time, the pain in my heart ceased to be a daily reminder of how bad I could feel and made me a stronger person. Life is for living and I lived.

Pinterest is a revolution, to undo the years of damage caused by social media. You see, Facebook and Twitter encouraged you to actually interact with people, so you could share the mind-numbing details of your life, even “@ messaging” specific people at times, forcing them to reply. But now……you can make all these boards and pin all this shit and it’s all for YOU! Sure you can follow people, and re-pin their pins (WTF?), but in the end it’s all about how pretty your boards look. It’s like having the walls of your home covered up in all your awkward hopes and dreams in a cut-and-paste collage…but without actually ruining your walls! That’s a win for both wall care and family relationships. Instead, Pinterest kindly offers to get “all up in the walls” of your mind’s daily obsessions (if that’s not Pinterest’s slogan already, they should pay me a large sum to use it).

Pet owners have insisted that their dogs were taken ill after eating the ‘Compy’ dog food which recently switched from cans to cartons.
No, though, this is More Like Electronic Farts we’re talking about, not Valve. (I once sent an email to Valve with an inquiry and they replied very quickly – and over a holiday, to boot!) I’m sure that Grant Rodiek or John Riccitiello (most likely the former) checked his email a few days ago and said to himself, oh my God people are angry at me AGAIN! What did my employees do THIS time?
i just wanted everything to be a bit more cohesive. i also picked up some flowers from home depot (the ones in the front have already almost-died then come back to life at least 2 times this week. resilient little guys!) and cute little pots. you can't really tell in the photo, but the pot that is sitting on the table in front of the bench is the perfect pale robin's egg blue that is in the pillows on the furniture.

The suggestion came up that we should look into the site where the former warden had been attacked. Now this was at a graveyard and frankly, the whole place crept me out and then the gnome showed up. Now Halflings I can deal, but gnomes? Creepy little buggers. To boot, he introduced himself as the new warden. Great. So the group talked with him about the current events and he said he would go talk to the feathered lizard for us to see what could be done and if there was any information on the elf’s mentor. I tried to follow him after he left but like I said, he’s creepy and fast. I lost him in the forest.

It's a fiercely hot summer, so hot that the north pole's heat record is broken by fifty degrees. Massive ice melt stuns the world as open ocean appears at the pole for the first time in living memory. Deep under the Atlantic Ocean, currents crucial to life react, dropping south -- and suddenly, storms of unprecedented ferocity start exploding over the arctic as cold air returns, slamming into the heat with cataclysmic results. The storms grow until they form a bizarre and gigantic blizzard unlike anything ever seen before. A stunned humanity realizes that a second ice age is about to engulf the earth.

That may seem a little overboard if you’re talking about, say, a short story or a smaller project, but it’s still a good idea to have to something in writing to make it well known between the two authors about their rights.

Xu Guan ran around the corner of the building to the side where the 55 gallon drums sat in a row. Near the back of the building Xu Guan tested the drums. When he found one that was empty, he moved it aside and began digging as fast as he could in the spot where the drum had sat. The hole was just over a meter deep when Xu Guan found that he had dug down below the foundation. Xu Guan dug a little farther back and then down underneath the concrete footings. The job became more difficult as Xu Guan attempted to tunnel beneath the concrete and back up into the dirt floor of the shed. After nearly an hour of furious digging, dirt collapsed onto Xu Guan from inside the building.

It seems that these huge rats started appearing in the Florida Keys between 1999 and 2001 after some really bright exotic animal breeder released 8 of them into the wild. I’m sure he really did not want to part with them, but, due to the economy and the rising cost of cheese, he had no other choice. My guess anyhow.

The opening verses look backwards to the earthly life and ministry of Jesus. Jesus is used rather than Christ for this was the name of His humanity and humility. Matthew1:21gives that command from God to call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins. This recounting ends with the ascension of Jesus as also seen in Luke 24:51, “And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried into heaven.” Luke is the only one of the four gospel writers that writes about the ascension.

Ok. Carter is a 3-dimensional thinker. He has the piece of a shelf under his bed. He brings it into my office and tells me he wants to make something. He has a piece of paper on which he as drawn out all the shapes and sizes of pieces he wants me to cut (like a part sheet you would see at the back of an appliance manual). I cut the pieces he wants and help him attach them together. He was making a trophy. He was in charge of family home evening and it was going to be a tournament of board games. This was the trophy for the winner. Allison was the lucky winner and her name is now on the front plate for all to see forever.

I live in Manhattan. It has its ups and downs, but overall it's petty cool. There's new construction going up everywhere but those tend to be luxury, state-of-the-art, high-falutin places. IOW: Very expensive. So the place I live was built roughly 50 years ago and as with any aging infrastructure it needs upkeep. About two months ago they started repointing the brick facade of my building which normally means replacing the outtermost inch or so of mortar with new mortar to keep water out. Unfortunately the corner and floor where I live happens to have such severe damage that they're replacing entire swaths (we're talking 50sq ft areas at a time) of brick but the good news is that they're putting a waterproof lining behind the new brick.

This is a post that, in essence, is just a rambling of incoherent thoughts, wrapped text, saying that I wish this world were a little less disappointing. This is a sign of suicide, as the pages upon futile pages of rudimentary psychological analysis of someone that needs counseling tells me. But honestly, the only way that we can discover our true thoughts and intentions is to continuously talk. It is the way a psychologist can analyze a patient, a lover their own, a human themselves.

That kind of put a downer on my day. I was at the ER for about 7 hours getting IV fluids, torodal (for pain), zofran and protonics (for nausea) and of course a little Tylenol for the fever. I'm home now still trying to recover. I'm honestly not sure how much more my body can take. It seems like one illness after the next. It's not good for my family and not at all good for my job.

In these last few weeks I have been to see my family again. In London we saw some wonderful works of art. The Sacred Made Real exhibition at the National Gallery is a rare and unique opportunity to see seventeenth century Spanish devotional painted woodcarvings of exquisite quality. Many of them are lifesize and imposing in their realism, and yet somehow more than real. There is blood and bruising, ivory teeth, glass eyes and horn fingernails. This figure of the dead Christ is by Gregorio Fernández:

This is the piece that goes in that hole. It's about 3/4 inch long and .450 diameter (the round part). It doesn't appear to be any sort of high-zoot alloy, and is finished in "something black". I was able to get a replacement from Savage, but that didn't solve my problem (I didn't know threads in the rifle upper were damaged until I got this). The threaded stud on the top of the piece is 10-32. The internal thread is an odd one: #12-32.

In putting together this post, I have simply and somewhat randomly set out what have seemed to me over the years generally to be the most common issues of weakness displayed by barristers in practice. To me, they really do seem obvious and straightforward, to the extent that reflecting on this post I am wondering why I even need to spell them out. I mean surely during the course of one of the most arduous and demanding journeys to becoming a member of such a highly respected profession, someone must teach them this stuff. Mustn’t they …?

It would be one thing if DiLorenzo made his argument using broken logic and an illegitimate distortion of the historical record such that certain events appear in a more or less favorable light. As one reads The Real Lincoln, though, one realizes that the 559 footnotes and a bibliography that contains 88 entries is not all for naught. DiLorenzo’s passion gleans though the text. I understand why he would be so passionate about writing about Abraham Lincoln. This era in American history is particularly steeped in controversy and pulls at the heart-strings of those that consider themselves so called “Civil War” buffs, Lincoln scholars, and history traditionalists. Like the intrepid alcoholics at their weekly meetings, they must accept they have a problem. That problem is that Lincoln escapes scrutiny and much of what they perpetuate about Lincoln is a myth.

Perhaps, dear reader, you have experienced loss this year – loss of a loved one, loss of friendship, loss of health, loss of financial security, loss of trust, loss of love, or loss of direction. Even with the best intent, words of encouragement shared by others can somehow seem insufficient to address an inconsolable loss. A spoken word cannot fully restore joy to a broken heart; however the Word can. And that’s the bottom line message of Christmas! God gave us the most amazing gift: His Son - the Word of God, the Holy Comforter.

Years before we had children we talked about Halloween and whether or not we would celebrate it when we did finally have our own little goblins.

Music goes out of print, and when it does, it disappears from these music services. This might change in the future, but basically these services are licensing music that somebody is selling somewhere. If the music is not for sale online or in stores, it doesn’t get license and thus not available to stream. But not ever song for sale is licensed for use in a subscription music service. Surprisingly, more and more are. I think we’re evolving away from owning music. Owning makes sense when music is on a physical medium, but it doesn’t make sense when it’s digital.

It’s easier to find things out, as I said. But it’s harder to think of obstacles for your characters to find things out. Realistically, your characters would spend an hour or two on the internet and find out what they need. It’s not very cinematic. The life blood of narrative film is conflict and when there is no challenge for your character, things get pretty tricky balancing reality and film reality.

Even after such a short course and a tapering off period I had withdrawal symptoms including mild auditory hallucinations (just for one afternoon). No one had really prepared me for this. It frightened me! Though it also made me glad that I had only taken the drug for a short period and wasn’t reliant on it. I can’t imagine how difficult it must be to wean yourself off it after several months, or a year (if you’re in this position – keep trying, with the help of a sensible physician and therapist. It’s so worth it!).
As I mentioned, the Swensons settled right around the same time. Like our family, they have occupied their farm since it was settled. They too leased out their crop ground prior to the crash.
Telegraph newspapers gave clues to his home address and refused to print an unedited reply. He was then turned on by Wisden whose following issue had five pages of vitriolic attack on him even though they printed the original article. Editor Mr Firth would not print a reply.

There’s really not a lot to watch on digital TV at that time of the morning whilst you’re periodically dabbing your cat with kitchen towel: only rolling news, freeview porn, and film-length adverts for space-age hoovers.
The others are all looking the same as yesterday. I brought Clarice out for a bit and all she did was cry the whole time. I'm off to make some turkey carcass soup with the vegetables I bought.
Other sources informed me that there were about 300 EDL protesters but that there must have been about 2,000 blacks and Asians who appeared to be very well organised.
The reason I asked her was that I have had quite a few of what were to me odd reactions from people, some written and some in person, and so had Tracey.
Actually I will be the one who won't be there. I have other plans - even if they only involve being in the room next door. In the meantime there is the usual incongruous collection of props to assemble; cowbell, bag of gold/beans, buckets, baskets and feather duster. Not my kind of shopping I'm afraid.

Hello everyone, hope you are all well and happy. Sorry that I've been missing again, my Mom hasn't too well and it's taken up quite a bit of time trying to get her sorted. Happily, she's much better now and more able to cope again.

Savanah's the type of horse that even if you're off her for weeks you get back on and pick up where you left off. With Rogo, if he's off for more than three days it takes weeks to get him back where he was. I'm not sure if it's just because he's younger, or because they have different personalities. Opinions / experience with this question?
At Arches NP, I spent most of the afternoon taking in the sights from the one-mile foot path along Park Avenue where red sandstone monoliths tower above the desert floor like stately skyscrapers. The most prominent of these were once cohesive fins of Entrada sandstone, gradually chiseled into their present forms by the unrelenting forces of nature. The mid-afternoon light was less than ideal for photography, but I tried to make the most of it by shooting a few HDR exposures.
Mr Jasper, who quit after the Standard revealed he had sent sexually charged emails to a woman heading an organisation which received City Hall funds, said he wanted to help improve Londoners' lives.
Oh, I've just remembered! My assignment for my creative writing class this week is about establishing setting, and our homework was to write three paragraphs about a place we've been. Mine's still in the works, but it will be three paragraphs about places I've been in Japan. Would you all like to see it when it's done? I know a lot of people have been asking for more detail about my Japan trip - I know, I know, I still owe you one article on it- it's coming, promise! - so if you're interested that'll be posted later this week! ♥
“Accordingly, as we forge ahead with the process of fundamental social, political and economic transformation of our country, we know too well that we can indeed count on the unflinching support of the Cuban people.
He started hosting AB the year I was born in 1957 and I can remember watching it from as far back as 4 years old in 61′. My God what innocence in the kids from those days to now. Maybe that was apart of the sadness. Dick Clark always referred to as America’s Oldest Teenager was a part of our youth, dreams and that at one time innocence. With the news of him dying it felt like a little part of all of us died right along with him. He meant that much.
And then there was the Fashion, Embroidery & Stitch show at the NEC in March where once again I was giving workshops on the Freudenberg Vilene stand. Had such a good time, talked to so many lovely people – takes a few days to come back down again. This was how I filled, maybe overfilled?, my stand.

When you decide to go to a restaurant for a special dinner, you enjoy the anticipation. You’ve committed to spending sufficient time and money, and now you’ve arrived, and the place looks good and smells good. You smile and order an appetizer. When it comes, you enjoy it as a foretaste of the larger, more complex courses that will follow, but you also savor it for what it is: a delicious dish, complete in itself. If it’s a truly great appetizer, you recognize it as an exquisite blend of flavor, texture and temperature. And you’re happy, because you know you’ll be in good hands for the entire evening.
The portly tonsured man, seated at the crystal kitchen table, glanced up from reading the newspaper at the man who had addressed him. "Good morning, Frankie."
We can now state reasons for doing design research. We believe that design research has the potential of establishing a conversation between different disciplines. Although still at its nascent stage but it is doing this by attempting to draw on methods and tools in use by natural sciences and other disciplines like psychology, social sciences to devise research methods of its own. This is synonymous to the discussion of “breaking the disciplinary matrix” by Kuhn; something which he regards as essential to bring a paradigm shift. May be utopian but as design researchers, we believe that interdisciplinary learning is essential for the growth of knowledge and design research can do this. On the other hand we also see a great value of design research to the development of design itself. Design, in the form of design research is learning to subject itself to a wider criticism and review and to a practice of acknowledging different sources of influence and origins. This brings a wider understanding of the context along with an ability to filter out any totalitarian or relativistic solution. We look forward to bring more insights into future discussions based on these notions of design research and its implications.
The other Halfling, not to be out-done, skipped the rope entirely and leapt straight onto the crocs back. A good athletics check gave him the opportunity to sneak attack, which he did to good escape. The thrashing vicejaw was unable to shake him, content to gnaw on his before dinner snack. The rest of the party proceeded to hurl their ranged weapons, or in the case of the dwarf, to make it to some shallow rocks on the other side and engage the squishy, squelching oozes. He sees a head pop up in the far corner of the chamber and can barely hear a hissing whisper. The nearest ooze reshapes his body into an ear-like shape, listening to the Kobold Ooze Whisperer before attacking the dwarf.
Paterson’s introduction to Elliott Carter’s Triple Duo presented the arresting image of a cocktail party, at which conversations between three pairs of people, more or less independent of each other and yet with some knowledge of and some reaction to the other conversations, finally closing with a conversation involving all six. Spatial separation between the three pairs heightened that way in for the listener; Carter may or may not approve, but there will always be other performances that do not adopt the experiment. It certainly offered clarity as well as visualisation for the first-time listener, so that the different varieties of ‘conversation’ – in rhythmic terms, triplets for flute and clarinet, twos and fours for violin and cello, slightly more elliptical groups of five for piano and percussion – might be more readily identified than would otherwise necessarily be the case. That in turn enabled one’s ear to devote a little more attention to the crucial intervallic characteristics of the different ‘conversations’ and eventually to the nature and implications of their combination. Again rhythmic exactitude proved fundamental to the success of the performance, permitting one to delight in the almost Haydnesque sense of invention Carter typically brings to his material. Perhaps surprising is the frankly lyrical quality of some of his writing, heightened again in performance.

Shankar got a hold on himself. He was becoming hypnotised by those eyes. But he had to stay alert. It wasn’t as if he could get some help — his survival depended on his nerves. But there was obviously a physical limit. His hand couldn’t go on staying still forever. At some point, even a snake bite must have appeared to be more appealing!

Guess who is super excited to be in heat?!!!Yep, BELLE!!! And yes that is her happy face. Cowpokette had to jump in for the picture too. Belle has come into heat and this time around we are going to breed her! We have been waiting a long time for this. I am really excited for little Belle pups. The kids are super excited too.
I have done a ton of personal work over the last few years, and in some areas of my life it shows tremendously. In this area, a very important area to me, it seems I am REALLY struggling. I haven’t felt this way or respected someone this much for as long as I can remember. He makes me want to be a better person and not only that, but he tells me every day that I am a good person and that I am lovable. Why can’t I believe it and let it be?
Rant over - sorry!!! Lol.
3 Days to go. I have not slept very well for the last 3 weeks. I have searched high and low for medics, but have only 3. Myself and one ambulance that I am standing down from my operations. I phone my stepson, who is one of the ambulance staff and plead with him to find me more staff. Even the medics who attended last year have pulled out. I have phoned my competitors and asked them to take over the event; assuring them that the exposure they will get far exceeds the little money they will get paid. Again I am turned down.
We've been known to laugh in synchronization, and even to burst out singing the exact same song at the exact same time, completely out of the blue. We make comments and references that cause us both to burst into laughter, when no one else has a clue what we're talking about. We exchange plenty of secrets that never go further than the two of us, and we almost always know what the other is getting at, even if we're exhausted and making no sense (which, being the very late night people we are, is a fairly frequent occurrence).
The other day, I overheard a sophomore calling one of my colleagues “A terrible teacher” because he, the sophomore, “didn’t learn anything.” I almost stopped to correct him, to tell him that learning is always a partnership and that, in fact, students may bear greater responsibility for whatever learning does or doesn’t take place.
I work full-time, people! I'm out the door at 6:15am, and home around 5-ish. That is, if I don't stop for errands. Then I get home closer to 6pm. I cook dinner, read the mail, tidy up a little bit, and spend a little bit of time visiting food blogs. I rarely have time to watch TV programs that I've recorded. By 8:30pm, I'm getting ready for bed and it's light's out! Repeat cycle.

I decided to order a Bloody Mary to compare with Brown’s which I had anticipated to be more or less the same. Unfortunately it wasn’t.

Over here in smug Sell! Towers we created our own little bubble, where common sense rules, and powerpoint is outlawed. However, we know that this isn't the case for everybody. So in an attempt to help redress the balance, we are fighting fire with with fire. We are creating a body of charts to illustrate common sense. We're sorry it has come to this. But here we are. Here. Anyway, now the smart people of advertising and marketing can fight the bullshitters and nonsense-talkers with their own charts. A chart-off, if you will.

Our flights were uneventful, we had a 5.5 hour flight to Reykjavik followed by a 2.5 hour flight to Heathrow (after a 1.5 hour break). This was actually a nice way to go things as it broke up the journey nicely and helped make the journey less arduous – I would do this again (as long as the break in the middle is less than two hours). We few Iceland Air, nice enough, however be warned that you need to buy your own headphones and all foods, so take on your own (they take your usual MP3 headphones). Nabeela found the trip tiring, and proclaimed that the only way she could be cheered up was by seeing her newly-bought anniversary jewellery. Maybe I should take her wedding jewellery around everywhere we go as an instant pick-me-up for whenever I c*ck up??!!

This article calls the Lega Nord "anti-immigrant," but this is a bit of a misnomer really, because it gives the impression that it is anti-"things foreign to Italy." The Lega Nord (per l'Indipendenza della Padania, which is the full name) is actually a party consisting of those who think that certain regions of northern/central Italy should either have more autonomy(according to the more mainstream view now dominant) or should secede altogether (no longer the official view, though some extremists would still claim this I imagine).
I'm going to burn my brain a little more with thinking, but, I have to make a choice, don't I? I have to decide something, I think I almost have the answer, but I still have got to think...
First stop ~ New York, for all of the festivities surrounding the annual Winter Antiques Show. While we couldn't see it all in one day, we did make it to the Duncan Phyfe exhibition at the Met (buy the catalogue) and the preview of the Betty Ring Collection at Sotheby's. Both truly fantastic! Our day in the city was capped by an evening reception at Gracie Mansion, where this particular blogger actually sat in a Duncan Phyfe chair. Yes, it is still in one piece (a testament to its excellent construction). The house itself is truly magnificent, a rare glimpse of Federal-era New York. If you have never been, make a point to go! They offer tours every Wednesday. . . and special tea tours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The butterflies are cut using the mini butterfly die by TH. For the one in the left hand corner I cut one from Grunge Paper and one from card. I used Distress Stains to colour them and then stamped over part of the card one using the Stampin' Up stamp called En Francais. The flower is made using the TH Tattered Flowers die cut from Crinoline, which you can buy from the lovely Linda's Zibbet Boutique. Then I used Tumbled Glass and Broken China Distress Stains to colour it and also the seam binding. The swirl is made with the mini flourish TH die, again coloured using Distress Stains. The word 'sister' is from a Dovecraft stamp set and the lovely brad is a Marah Johnson.

"In Gloucestershire, England, 1970, five musicians got together to rehearse, producing one of the most innovative and under rated rock bands of the seventies. The original idea for this band was first conceived in a hotel room in New York City, by Peter Solley and Keith Webb. At the time, they were the opening act for The Rollingstones, with the Terry Reid Band. Deciding to break away from the creative restrictions imposed on them as backing musicians, they returned to England to form their own band called PALADIN. Many months were spent finding the right blend of musicians, writing and rehearsing. The band consisted of Lou Stonebridge on vocals, piano, and harmonica, Derek Foley on guitar and vocals, Peter Solley on organ, piano, violin and vocals, Keith Webb on drums and percussion, and Peter Beckett on bass and vocals. Stonebridge and Foley had been playing with the band Grisby Dyke, and Peter Beckett was formerly of the band WORLD OF OZ. When the rehearsals began, it was clear that PALADIN was going to be a dynamic live band. Instead of recording a demo, they invited people from the music industry to attend the rehearsals. Their sound was a mix of rock, blues, soul, jazz, and latin, creating a rich blend of world beat, long before it existed. PALADIN'S use of dual keyboards also created a unique sounds. By the end of 1970, they hit the road to play live gigs. Their first appearance took place at the Revolution in London. After some negogiations, PALADIN signed with the newly formed Bronze Records. They began recording their self-titled, debut album on January 8, 1971, at Olympus Studios in West London. They also recorded some of the album at Island Studios, also in London. They recorded almost everything live in the studio, with a few overdubs. This decison produced some outstanding pieces of music. A year later, it was time for their second album, which was recorded at the famous Apple Studios in London. Entitled CHARGE!, the second album was pegged by critics to be the absolute classic masterpiece of the 70's. This diverse album, which at times mixed folk with rock and roll, made it difficult to pinpoint influences. The lead vocals were shared by the band members on select songs. Famous album cover artist Roger Dean, designed THE PALADIN, a rider on a horse, for CHARGE!, claiming it to be one of his most difficult sketches. Unfortunately, PALADIN'S lack of success led to frustration, with Stonebridge and Foley deciding to leave the band in the middle of 1972. Foley was replaced by Joe Jammer on vocals and guitar. However, the revised lineup didn't last long and by the end of the year, PALADIN disbanded. The career of PALADIN produced two of the finest hard/prog albums of the 70's. They also recorded early versions of tracks leaning more toward jazz. These were later reworked and the tapes were forgotten for almost 25 years until their release in 2002 by Rock Symphony under the name of JAZZATTACK. PALADIN did record live for the BBC but the tapes are believed to be still collecting dust in the vaults of old Beeb in London. Today, Peter Solley owns Peter Solley Productions, a company that produces MIDI files." (www.peterbeckett-player.com)
During pregnancy I researched the available cloth diapering options. There were a fair number of fitteds, a few pockets, and the standbys - prefolds and flats. Our cloth diapering journey began with 24 cotton bleached preemie prefolds, 6 ProRaps Basics* in the preemie and newborn sizes, a Bummis wet bag in medium, a Bummis wet bag in small, diaper pins, and 2 Snappis. To be honest, the Proraps didn't fit her very well and left marks on her thighs. We also had foldover issues on the tummy where she would get scratched by the velcro.

However, it's neither Seth nor Finn who is the star of this interview. Conal MacGregor is the quiet one--the 'good brother', and I feel that sometimes he's overlooked for that very reason--though he's just as..um...'huggable' as his younger brother. I also really wanted to know a bit more about what made him tick, and to get inside his head. So Gillian very kindly agreed once more to act as amanuensis, and write down Conal's answers to my fearsomely intrusive and personal questions. (Honestly? I'm just really nosy! But Shh! Let's just pretend I'm an intrepid journo on assignment for Hello! for the moment....)
I plan for a simpler, less stressful Christmas season and, every year, by Christmas Eve I'm exhausted! After our delicious and very-time-consuming-to-make traditional Swedish meal to honor my husband's relatives (think: Vikings), it's time to head to church. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but the last few Christmas Eves, I have sent my husband and kids off without me. The pull to spend an hour of quiet in the house feels as strong as a magnet.
I realize it may not last. It is only March, and this kind of weather usually doesn't arrive until late April... or late May... ! But boy is it nice while it's here!

Spending two days at Shepherd’s Field Children’s Village outside Beijing was a highlight of our trip. Shepherd’s Field is an orphanage offering loving care, education, and necessary medical attention to special needs orphans until they are placed with a permanent home through adoption.

I think I may be allergic to raw onions and garlic so I didn't add any fresh chopped onions to mine, wish I could have though! I can see topping these with a dash of fresh tahini sauce or a crunchy pickle relish or even salsa. They had the cool creamy sauce and mildly spiced 'meat' flavor I was looking for and I didn't even have to go to the store. The cucumber sauce was actually more than we could use but it made excellent salad dressing the next day.
Until next time....Happy Stampin'!

"The sexual cells of the 'tetraploid' form of a plant will, therefore, contain twenty chromosomes, i.e. the full number characteristic of the original diploid variety. If a tetraploid female hop is crossed with a diploid male, the cells of its progeny will contain three sets of chromosomes - two from the tetraploid female and one from the diploid male. They are, therefore, called 'triploids'. As they contain a full complement of chromosomes from the female plant, they will have a very much greater chance of resembling that parent. Dark proposed in this way, by using disease-resistant male plants, to produce disease-resisting varieties closely resembling existing varieties in their other general characters, but, because triploids are usually sterile, containing less seeds."

Some fun from the Inquisition though, there are a bunch of beers that weren't needed by the judging and so I'll be able to get these three cases of unopened beers and serve them in the HomeBrewer's Corner at the Black Star Social this coming Saturday. It means that we'll have more beer to serve and we will likely last past 8:45pm this time and we don't waste any of the entries.

Moe areas/booth and events like the Maid Cafe, K-on live dubbing and cosplay skids are well received though. People have made it clear that they are willing to fork up triple of the entrance fee to attend them. These moe related events garner a lot of hype even before the convention starts.Sure, Mamoru Hosada’s talk did garner quite a crowd in the end but it is definitely not as heated as the K-on live dubbing or the cosplay skids . Not to mention, I never heard of anyone getting excited about Mamoru Hosada before and after the event . It’s also pretty clear that K-on is pretty much the big thing here and from the things people do and like, it isn’t hard to notice that fans here are geared towards the moe fandom.
Seventy-five years ago, in the midst of the Spanish Civil War, the Basque town of Guernica was carpet bombed by Fascist Italian and Nazi German forces. Three-quarters of Guernica was destroyed, and as many as 1,600 civilians were killed. The attack was immortalised in Pablo Picasso's Guernica, one of the most iconic paintings of the twentieth century.Which showed the horrors of war as expressed by the destruction of Guernica.

As far as my spirituality goes, I must admit, I haven't been to church on a regular basis in some time. The last few years, I have been distracted and somewhat disappointed in the church communities I have encountered so I have strayed. This past weekend, my husband and I actually went to a non-denominational gathering. It was very different from anything I have been to and we decided that we would continue going. The music and the message were more relevant and you could tell people truly enjoyed being there. It was a nice change.

Shimla Rohru Trek is a medium difficult trek. You can easily go for this trek in between the months of May to June and also in between September to October. Rohru is in the Shimla region, near Dhanwari. From Shimla there is a convenient road towards Dhanwari and on way you will get the opportunity to visit the places like Jubbal and Theo in addition to Rohru. There is also a tourist rest house. The maximum duration for Shimla Rohru trek is of 2-3 days.

Is there a Kinks bias on this list? Yes, because Raymond Douglas Davies is the greatest rock conceptual songwriter of all time. I could easily have put in the number ten position Muswell Hillbillies, Lola Vs Powerman And The Money-go-round, Preservation Act 1 and 2, or Schoolboys In Disgrace. I chose Soap Opera because of its simple tale that resonates so well with today’s celebrity-fixated culture. The story revolves around Norman, a common man who wants to be rock star in order to escape his mundane world. Ray Davies has always been in tune with everyday feelings and emotions. Is there a more real story than the idea that we all want to be famous? Soap Opera accurately foreshadows the beginning of the modern celebrity cult that we find so fascinating today. I envision a slightly revised Broadway show with Norman now playing Guitar Hero or Rock Band 2 on his play station as he rules the universe. With Ray Davies as the writer, everybody’s a star.

I feel as if the year has well and truly started...it is already mid January and I have had a lazy kick off to 2011. Spending a few days away after the holiday festivities is the leisurely way to move into a new year. As we drove home from Switzerland to our farm in southern France my thoughts turned from snow capped mountains and skiing techniques, from fluffy light-as-air meringues and double cream, from crunchy rosti potatoes and melt-in-the-mouth milk chocolate to practical matters.
I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to judge myself within my writing where I place a specific standard upon my writing and thus if I don’t reach that standard I go into fear and anxiety instead of just writing what I experience without judging my process and within that simply sharing what I am going through as to show the whole picture and the whole journey with all detail and experiences that get in my way as it’s possible that others will go through the same thing when starting their journey of self-exploration

The God of the mystic is not necessarily the God of sectarian religion. The mystical conception of Divinity goes beyond the narrow sectarian conceptions of God that rule in some religious circles. The Divine Creative Power, from a mystical perspective, is that which has created human nature in its own image, imbuing all human beings, not just religious believers, with a capacity to act selflessly and generously, to follow impulses other than one’s own self-interest, and that this tendency is innate, or latent, in the human condition itself.

The second layout was for the Get the Cover Look page the Scrapbook Magazine usually does. They show you how to make the cover layout and then give you two examples of other layouts you can try and mine was one of those. I actually found this one a bit hard to do as the magazine supplies the photo and you use the free paper that comes with the magazine and as little else as possible but it was still fun!

Banks will only borrow from the ECB in this way if it is their cheapest source of funding. But right now, it isn't. 1-week Euribor, which is the rate the best banks charge each other for loans, without collateral, is about 0.35%. So, if you're a financially secure European bank, you have the choice of borrowing at 1% from the ECB and having to post collateral, or borrowing at 0.35% on the market without collateral. This choice is a no-brainer! You're going to borrow on the market.
The Expo Culture Centre, designed by Shanghai architect Wang Xiao’an, won first prize in the Shanghai category of the 2010 Far Eastern Architectural Design Award, a Taipei-based architecture prize honouring innovation in Shanghai and Taiwan. ‘China has huge opportunities for architects but many works are designed in foreign collaboration,’ said judge Zheng Shiling, director of the Institute of Architecture and Urban Space at Shanghai’s Tongji University and a consultant to the World Expo. According to Zheng the building has a ‘stunningly complicated structure’.

Shortly after midnight on March 18, 1990, two men broke into the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston and committed the largest art heist in history. They stole a dozen masterpieces, including one Vermeer, three Rembrandts, and five Degas. But after thousands of leads—and a $5 million reward—none of the paintings have been recovered. Worth as much as $500 million, the missing masterpieces have become one of the nation's most extraordinary unsolved mysteries.

A couple of nights ago, I decided to take them for a treat at a frozen yogurt place. Sean was not too much in favor of the adventure since it was late and they had whined a bit. But I had promised them earlier, so I decided to take them anyway. Ryan was stressed the entire car ride. I could tell he wasn’t enjoying himself. Finally, he asked me, “Mom,

The final one I’m going to mention isn’t country, but it’s every bit as special to me. “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey. This is one of my all time favorites to listen to while writing the scenes with the badboy and the girl next door archetypes. I feel this one creates an atmosphere where they can meet and get to learn the true people inside of each other. I also feel this is the perfect song to represent what the badboy faces day in and day out. Anyone who reads my work knows I have a soft spot for the badboy archetype. There is just something about them and figuring out what makes them tick that I can never resist.
But the point was the fear he instilled. I hated those parent-teacher meetings. I hated the feeling of that fear. And my brother was the same for a really long time. Him worse than me, because my dad did not do anything to get close to my brother. He tried to make me happy because he wanted to keep molesting me. But he wanted my brother out of the way. And eventually when my brother was old enough, he left for university. And when he tried to come back, my father made sure my brother felt controlled, under pressure and unhappy, so that he would not want to come back. He wanted to control my mother and me, and was afraid that my brother would one day see how evil he was…

Eventually, any ale or lager yeast will reach its limit of survivability as the alcohol levels continue to rise. Thus, brewers will sometimes switch to other strains of yeast in later stages to finish off the fermentation to the target levels. Champagne yeast is a favorite alternative, as it is highly tolerant to alcohol and neutral in flavor.

I was listening to the radio the other day and there was a snippet of Reece Witherspoon (I heart her) plugging her new movie (I can’t wait to see it). She said that Pinterest was her favorite site at the moment and that she is addicted to it. Pinterest? Never heard of it so I put it in my file bank. I am an avid reader of the Daily Candy blog and on Facebook yesterday there was a status about how the Daily Candy was now on Pinterest.

For Aubrey's party - we did a little bit of a circus/carnival theme - I'll admit largely due to the fact that I was slightly obsessed with the pennant flag banners that are popping up all over the place right now. I just love them and thought they would make adorable party decor. My sister Nikki, of Doodle Dog Advertising, made some adorable invitations for the party featuring a cute little elephant that I decided to use for the cookies too.

On Wednesday, I wrote about my belief that Christians need to rediscover that profound fast which Lent was once known for. In the same post, I also briefly mentioned the old tradition - but one that was new to me - of eating pretzels during the Lenten season. It seems that these savoury snacks were especially invented for the purpose of fasting during Lent - as a replacement for luxury foods.

They have a product called Insul-Bright which is an insulated lining for oven mitts, tea cozies etc so I used that. I bought some 10mm bias binding but with all the layers of the mitt it wasn't really wide enough for a novice like me so I went back and got the 25mm instead. One of the ladies at Bernina gave me some good advice which was to zigzag around the whole mitt before binding it so the layers would be nice and flat to bind. I also used the zigzag stitch to attach the binding to the mitt. It's not perfect at all but I am happy with it for a first go, and Kelli was rapt with it so thats good! I was a bit worried that I should have put some cotton batting in the mitt as well but Kelli used it last night and said it worked a treat so that's a relief!

So let's be clear - it is not "boomer warfare" which has distorted our politics, or made rational politics so elusive since the 60's: it is something far deeper, something far older, something which has been with us from the beginning in this country, and which we in turn brought with us from the Old World; something which in fact traces back to the very origin of humanity - spiritually, psychologically, politically, evolutionarily. That depth is what gives the American story its pathos and its importance. That is why the world watches us: to see if we can work it out - to see if there is hope.
But the war has now ended, peace reigns and there is a desperate need for dealing with the past in a way that solidifies that peace and ensures an untroubled future.

The shopping environment will be all about experience rather than stuff. Stuff in all its ranges, sizes colours and packaging will need to be available, but it will not be the main attraction. Apart from all the emotional, rational and functional aspects of making choices and purchases, people also need somewhere to go, to hang out, to see and be seen. Employees will, therefore, be more conscientious about the “hangouts” and brands they want to be associated with.
I have a tart shell crust that I've fallen in love with, and it's the one from The New Best Recipe from Cook's Illustrated. It doesn't look like it from this photo but it's very easy to work with (I mauled it once it was in the pan). It's like a buttery shortbread, and that's a good thing in a tart shell.
But back to the resurrection and history. I see one clear difference between stories of the resurrection of Jesus and his virginal conception. I can think of no historical effect which is / would be different for a virginally conceived as opposed to a conventionally conceived Jesus. Mark, who seems not to know of such a conception, portrays a no less miraculous Jesus than Luke, who does. Indeed, it seems that Christian belief in sexual restraint and renunciation in the early centuries leads to greater emphasis on the virginity of Mary, rather than vice versa. By contrast, early Christian history is full of the effects of belief in the resurrection. Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to say that belief in the resurrection is the proximate cause of early Christian history.

At the humble Sargent farm outside Wabash, Ind., Lee's hard shell begins to soften and melt in the glow of a household suffused by warmth, affection and mutual support -- the kind of nurturing family atmosphere that was completely missing from her own upbringing just a few towns away. This idyll of a Hoosier holiday brims with lovely moments, from Sterling Holloway leading the family in singing "The End of a Perfect Day" around the Christmas tree to the always-delightful Elizabeth Patterson (here at her sweetest) ruefully musing about her own youthful brush with romance ("I twiddled around with the idea one summer; was all right again by fall.").

I could go on. Porn. Access for people to cheat on their other halves via dating sites. Ease of commnication between terrorists. A mouthpiece for racists, bigots of all kinds. It was all out there before, but everything was harder. It was harder to communicate, to get yourself listened to. You had to go out and find a bit on the side, now you can just order one from the comfort of your sofa. You wanted porn you had to go to your local video shop or newsagent. And don't get me started on parents who don't keep an eye on what their children access on there. It's all so much easier, and only time will tell if this ease of everything will have a positive impact on society.
Had Malibu Shark Attack kicked it old school and gone with some honest to goodness, old fashioned, hella bitey Great Whites, I’d have probably enjoyed this more. Turns out Goblin sharks are bit rubbish. All in all, rather less exciting than that episode of Baywatch where that lifeguard lady that isn’t Pam Anderson gets attacked by a shark while saving a boy, but Hassellhoff saves her and then she dies anyway of something stupid. Also, what the hell happened to poor old Peta Wilson? She looked unwell and frankly miserable as sin, like maybe someone was making her act at gunpoint, but, as it turns out, she is up for a threesome so that’s good to know.

"Jerry," began the kindly voice, "I realize that there is apparently no connection between the machine and increasing the velocity of molecules. You will get more from the idea if you will suspend judgment a while. The red glow is caused by the colloidal gold in the ruby glass over the top. The particles of the glass are exceedingly small aggregations of molecules of gold suspended in the super-cooled liquid we call glass. These transmit and reflect red light. The size of the colloidal particle controls the color of the light to be reflected or transmitted. In the case of the blue light collected from tobacco smoke or some wood smokes, the particle is of such size as to cause Tyndall's law to take effect. You will remember Tyndall found that in reflecting white light, colloidal particles of this size reflect the colors of the rainbow in intensities inversely proportional to the fourth power of their wavelengths. Thus, since the blue light has the shortest wavelength, the inverse fourth power would be the largest number and hence the greatest color in visible intensity. Lilies owe their white color not to white pigments but to the diffusion of light striking the very tiny colloidal bubbles of air in the lily petals. Of course, when all colored lights striking the lily petal are diffused thoroughly, they mix and form white light. The same phenomenon is found in the case of white hair -- no white pigments are found -- only colloidal bubbles of air to so diffuse the light as to appear white. As to this machine, the red light is purely accidental. I did not design the machine to make red light. I used ruby glass because I find the Roentgen rays do not penetrate the glass as was heretofore believed. The light is a byproduct of the true purposeful action of the machine. Observe, please."
Then we have blogs. On my blog roll are many blogs I like to read as often as possible, but I follow loads more. Bloggers share ideas, and often recommend things to read. Which I then buy. They link to articles, and I follow blindly, trying to absorb as much information as I possibly can. They link to other blogs, and it is a neverending trawl from one to another. Hours of fun. Hours. Blogs have replaced magazines for me (apart from my subscriptions), except there are so many more than magazines to read.

I was also tired. We had recieved a call about a situation at our rental so we had to drive down to deal with it yesterday. The renters have a brand new baby and they have seen, and caught, some rats and noticed a bad smell coming from under the house. So my husband - who is always my hero but especially so yesterday - went under the house not once, but 4 times! Something you could not pay me enough money to do! Cleaned up the "bathroom" under there - set out a bunch of traps - and put some odor neutralizer things there. I just hope it all works.
So we talk about maybe getting the generic (for $3) would be better than waiting till Monday. So we take a chance, and drive to a 24 hour Walgreens. And wait. And wait. And wait. And finally, a guy comes out. Andrea asked him if he could tell her how much it would cost, and he said that it wouldn't be until 2am that he could help us. That there were 18 prescriptions waiting in front of her. What? He couldn't even look at the prescription? That's not cool.
Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, by Mindy Kaling – So. Much. Fun. After Tyneford I needed some laughs so I turned to someone that I think is absolutely hysterical – Mindy Kaling, better known as the shallow, dippy customer service representative Kelly Kapoor in the American version of The Office. You wouldn’t know it to watch her none-too-bright character, but Mindy is actually brilliant (Dartmouth grad – almost as good as Cornell!) and has been a writer/producer on the show since the first season. Mindy’s book is part memoir, part stream-of-consciousness-random-goofiness and I laughed until I cried. I knew that Mindy was smarter than Kelly, but after reading about her journey from a childhood as a “timid chubster afraid of her own bike” all the way to the glittering lights of Hollywood, I had a whole new respect for her and enjoyed Kelly that much more the next time I tuned into The Office. (Also, Ryan – LEAVE KELLY ALONE. She deserves better than you! So says Pam, and so say I.)

After the game, I went for a much needed mani/pedi with another baseball mama! I am so happy that Kyan plays with kids that live in the neighborhood and go to his school! I have become close with a few of the mamas and it is nice to know that I can count on them to pick up Kyan or they can count on me to grab their kid from school if they are running late/stuck in a meeting! I got gel nails once again and I love that the salon I go to have about 60 different colors to choose from. It was the toughest decision I had to make! Later that afternoon, we loaded up the car as a family and went to watch Xavier play some football across town. We had plans to go out for pizza afterwards, but I was able to talk everyone in to going to Fajita's (it wasn't hard, they loved it too), since we were close (and I have been begging for months to make the drive - Chad and I used to frequent there quite a bit back in the day)! It is always nice to catch up with the Swishers, lots of laughs are always had when we are with them!

The 1015 has a very short season—they only grow from April to late May. And this is why when I do encounter them I buy as many as I can carry because I might not see them again, which is just what I did last week. As I worked through my latest acquisition, I’d eaten them in the ways mentioned above, but I still had a few left. While I wasn’t getting tired of them, I was looking for something new. And that’s when I learned about Texas 1015 sweet onion and rice casserole.
A bit of work here has found that Golden Shield Corporation was founded in March 1959 and incorporated in Delaware 3-11-59. Apparently the company's main place of business (offices, warehouse) was at Great Neck, Long Island, New York. The company essentially existed to distribute home equipment such as radios that it had designed, which were made by either itself or more often other companies. Many Golden Shield, or else Astrotone radios are found even today. The company had other product lines such as sewing machines, vacuums and of course, as we know, typewriters. We are pretty sure that this company itself did not survive the middle 1960's since it appears that its only registered trademark ("Astrotone") was sold to Magnavox in 1967. That makes us think that the company's life span was essentially 1959-1967 and that matches up well with the typewriters we see labeled as "Golden Shield." So then what Golden Shield was doing was having Smith-Corona specially decorate and label these machines, which it then distributed. It is interesting that the Smith-Corona name is not only so visible on these relabeled machines, but even on there at all.

It is unfortunate that the “me first” attitude that currently permeates our society is only made worse by the slippery slope of acquiescence by the minority whether it’s the right thing to do or not.

6. Pay attention. Start with keeping a journal. Even a few simple notes to remind yourself of what happened, what was meaningful, what you felt, what was said, and how you connected the dots. This process continues into a moment by moment mental note taking—noticing what is happening. Becoming aware is the process of dropping the unhelpful “programming” we assume is us, but really is simply something that has been downloaded to our systems. By seeing ourselves and our lives through a compassionate, non-judgmental space, we allow for the opportunity to live joyfully and free.

We bump into long-haired Roli who knows the artist and apparently that’s her subject of choice – all things penetrative – I’m chuffed to have picked up the message so clearly having failed Intercert Art and being totally devoid of any artsy-craftsy competency! Art to me is very much what you make of it, once it’s out in the public sphere, you can assent and assume what you like. I can’t stand reading what I’m supposed to take from it, what this piece means or that painting intimates. Bog off and let me make up my own mind! There’s organic pods stuck up a tree bark with dinky cars growing in them (no doubt a profound message about how we’re making a fume-filled mess of the natural environment), a giant nest with bright blue duck eggs, sound boxes next to the river, tall bronze heron keeping some spoilt ducks company and strange objects hanging from the vines in the Victoriana glasshouses. A stone mattress leans curvaveously against a wall, a simple tagline Insomnia as its chosen communiqué.

But mainstream liberals from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama — and the intellectuals and journalists who love them — often assert that they are simply dispassionate slaves to the facts; they are realists, pragmatists, empiricists. Liberals insist that they live right downtown in the “reality-based community,” and if only their Republican opponents weren’t so blinded by ideology and stupidity, then they could work with them.

In the wake of their pillaging by international financiers, Greeks who have realized that protesting is likely to bring little relief have begun to implement barter systems to meet their local community needs.

When Dymphna heard about the situation she asked me to post a notice to correct the record.

And as for the Wolff incident, well, what can I say? Clearly everyone overreacted big time. Wolff didn't need to be such a dick. As a film critic, he's been to enough movie theaters to know that they tend to frown on people sneaking food and/or drink into theaters. He should also know that people still do it anyway, and often. He didn't need to act like he was above it. That said, was a single bottle of some health drink really worth calling the cops? No winners in this situation, says I.

From a visual standpoint, Street Fighter X Tekken looks very similar to Street Fighter 4 albeit sharper and some more detail, It may not be the most impressive looking fighter out there but it certainly has a nice and colourful art style which makes it nice to look at. I have to say that I also really like how the Tekken characters look going from the more realistic style to the more wacky cell-shady style of the Street Fighter 4 series. The stages however, look really awesome, and feel much bigger than the stages from Street Fighter 4. There’s a few stages are multi-layered and between rounds you’ll change location and there are lots of references to both franchises littered through each stage, and there’s a stage that features a giant Pandora woolly mammoth chasing after you…that’s just awesome. The music is also pretty good, with some pretty memorable tunes and has a bit of a Tekken-vibe with some trance elements in a few of the songs. Like other Capcom fighting titles, you can choose english or japanese voices for the characters although a few characters are language locked (I.E.

Yoochun is really scared of bugs. If there was only one fly, he would hold a bracket and wandered around. Sometimes if those insects were still there, he would use one can of F killer (insecticide I think) to kill them all. Out of all the bugs he’s really scared of (the most scariest one) is spider because he said when he sees their eyes, they feel like they can really move so fast. There was time when he confronted with spider and he called for Yoohwan and asked him if it was dead and Yoohwan said it was. Yoohwan just used his hand to stamp it and then he responded with choking sign. He’s really different from Yoohwan. Yoowhan, even at 4th, he grabbed spider with his bare hand. Even now if Yoochun sees spider, he calls her or Yoohwan while he himself runs away somewhere else. She asked him “in this house you are a man. Aren’t you supposed to be the one take it away?” and he said “I cant with something like spider” (How cute chun scared of bugs )
Potential migrants in the Middle East and North Africa were the most likely worldwide to say they plan to leave their countries permanently in the next 12 months. While more than one in five adults (21%) in the Middle East and North Africa overall said they would migrate permanently to another country if they had the chance, one in six of them said they were planning to do so in the near term.

Jeff had to work late last night. We never made it to the grocery store over the weekend so we didn't actually have anything to eat in the house aside from frozen veggies and bags of flavored rice. Jeff had eaten the hold out frozen pizza last week. I didn't want to take the time to go to the grocery store without feeding the kids first- that's a recipe for disaster. Zach's behavior in restaurants lately has been pretty bad so me taking both kids by myself didn't feel like a good option. Fast food just didn't sound appealing in the slightest.
School is almost over! Only one more week and then finals. It’s so crazy how quick it went, and how much work gets assigned at the end! I swear I’ve had a total of 10 papers due in since my last post. And a few exams. Some of them have been KILLER. I studied my ass off for my CHD development exam and I’m pretty damn sure I aced it. My math class is the one that has been giving me the most stress, but I’m really keeping the positive outlook on it and keeping my spirits up.

Often the Cthulhu Mythos is recognized by the notion of one specific feature: the tentacle. Last week, I sat outside a pub at the Miskatonic river, enjoying the blooming trees and discussing idle topics with some colleagues. One of Henry’s students dropped by and the conversation shifted towards Lovecraft’s fiction. From my fellow readers, I got the impression that the tentacle might become the biggest addition to public culture from this author. The tentacle is a small detail in the depiction of the Old One, and it might have vanished in the evocation of Cosmicism, what in my opinion is the bigger contribute from his side.

Promoters of giant wind turbines, and for that matter of centralized power generation schemes of all kinds, tend to talk quite a bit about economies of scale. In an expanding economy with a stable or growing resource base, that sort of talk often makes sense, though the extent to which those economies of scale are a product of direct and indirect government subsidies to transportation, financing, and large businesses generally is not something economists like to talk about. Still, in a world facing economic contraction, resource depletion, and a loss of complexity potentially capable of rendering a great deal of today’s infrastructure useless or worse, the balance swings the other way. In the face of a future where small, cheap, localized approaches that are sparing in their use of resources, relying on massive, expensive, centralized, resource-intensive power plants of any kind is not an economy but a profligacy of scale, and one that we very probably will not be able to afford for much longer.
The majority of people would limit this debate to simply Kobe or LeBron. I think that Rose, Durant, Howard, and Love have legitimate arguments, but it is Kobe or LeBron in the end. The top two players in the league are Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. Bryant leads the league in points, is in his fifteenth year, and is still playing at an unbelievably high level. On the other hand, LeBron James is nearly averaging a triple-double, has the Heat sitting atop of the Eastern Conference, and is in the prime of his career.

I had some crappy clams and pasta at an Italian place down the street, but whatever. We called a happy hour for a few of the guys, calling it the "Oil and Gas Boys" happy hour. Since our happy hour, the price of oil has gone down by about $23, so check us out man.
The doors opened at 6, but I felt as if we were eagerly waiting, leaning against the railing for about an hour before the opening band, The Miniature Tigers began their set. Having been curious about this opening act, I had looked into the Miniature Tigers prior to attending the concert. From what I heard in their recordings, I doubted I would enjoy them. (Though nothing will ever surpass the horror that was Foxy Shazam. They played with their feet…literally…) Yet, I ended up being pleasantly surprised in that the Miniature Tigers were much better to listen to live than they were in recording. (A rare find–like a Charizard card in the original 150 decks.) However, I always find that the opening band is supposed to complete one simple task–warm up the audience for the band they really came to see. The Miniature Tigers seemed to fall a bit short in this respect. True, their lead singer did his best to get the audience interacting, but due to their somewhat mellow Modest Mouse meets The Beatles and Whites Stripes sound–it was difficult to get the audience pumped. Their last song, ‘Sex on the Regular’ was catchy enough to get a little “wiggle” (as the lead singer put it ) into the crowd. After re-listening to them, I think they may be something I could even get into.(And apparently their song ‘The Wolf’ was in that movie Easy A.)

I read this book because my mom had heard about it and she wanted it to be the first book I bought on my Nook. I was pretty excited to read it because it basically spelled out my high school life; being the odd-one-out, not always fitting in, sometimes feeling lost in a sea of popularity. I started reading this book and knew that I would have some late nights with me, this book, and my lamp.
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to go cliff jumping. Pretty sure he was being sarcastic because he knows I’m terrified of falling. I can jump off the high dive into a pool, but it takes quite a bit out of me to do it and the platform board is out of the question. He asked me why I wouldn’t want to go cliff diving and since telling him I’m acrophobic has gotten me nowhere I told him that people can die like that. He asked where I heard that and I told him about a 1000 Ways to Die episode where… let’s just say the guy landed wrong and water went somewhere it shouldn’t. As a female, there are two such places.

The aim of Reiki is to restore the balance. To be ‘unbalanced’ is to be unwell. The Reiki energy tries to remove any blocks to achieving balance. It always works for what is good or best for the receiver. Reiki cannot be misused and can only do good. Reiki always comes in the quantity needed at that time and for the greatest good of the receiver. A Reiki receiver can ask for Reiki for something they specifically want it to work on, but it may be that the Reiki comes in response to the ‘need’ of the recipient rather than the ‘want’. Words used in an attempt to describe Reiki energy are love, compassion, nurture, support and peace.

Don't have much time for a lengthy update right now - things are pretty hectic. As you know, we took Levi and Steph down to the hospital yesterday to continue his fifth round of chemo. It was a rough morning - I won't bore you with the details, but one of the mornings where everything you try to do right and all the plans you've made don't amount to anything; you realize pretty quickly on mornings like that it doesn't really matter what you try to do in your own strength.
I’m sure there are times when I should have done research, but that doesn’t mean I did it, and it was never really necessary. That’s the nice thing about fantasy and horror – often you can just cheat and go with the not-recommended-but-oh-so-easy “because I’m the author and I said so” explanation rather than try to write something based in scientific fact.

Borrowing heavily from Potter, particularly the key musical stylisation of the BBC series Pennies from Heaven (which Potter adapted into an ill-fated 1981 film for MGM starring Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters), Same Old Song also draws upon a host of Potteresque themes – especially the collision of fantasy and reality and the heavy mediation of personal expression. Of course, each of these themes remain – along with the confrontation between conditional memory and ‘the imaginary’ – typical of Resnais’ own 60-something years of filmmaking.
Everyone always says, "There's SOMEthing about San Francisco." And then they proceed to try to nail it down by making lists of the things that make this city what it is... But you can't do that and actually capture that something. Maybe because it's different for everyone. Maybe it's not actually something and people just need to justify why they live in a loud, crowded, dirty city with a bunch of loud, crazy people.

The story line is a complex one, almost as if the author was challenging himself, but I never had a problem following it throughout. He also uses some literary devices I have never come across before, i.e. the use of italics, bold face and regular type, to differentiate between the various voices. It is an unorthodox method—at least it is to me—but it worked.

I wonder if we have had so little interaction at the moment in order to maintain a sense of mystery. Particularly in relation to the Lord Ruler. I’m finding it difficult to believe that he’s immortal for example and can’t help wondering if he has some sort of secret device or other means or regenerating himself? I suppose the less we know the more our minds will run rampant looking for explanations. I like that about Sanderson’s way of storytelling. The other thing that I’m really enjoying about Sanderson’s storytelling is just that he has this brilliant way of making me feel as though I’m on the same wavelength as him (which I’m pretty sure I’m not), but, what I mean about that, is I read something and think (‘well, why/where/when,etc) and within a few pages or lines even he’s explaining away my query. It’s great – it’s as though he’s reading my mind and answering my thoughts as we go along (virtual reading!).
Pilsner Urquell pours a rich straw color and is dominated by an impressive hop character, derived from 100% Saaz hops. The bittering is solid, the hop flavor decidedly spicy, the aroma prickly and enticing. The beer is highly carbonated, which brings a sharpness to both nose and palate that is rousing and engaging. While most ales are better served at just below room temperature, in my opinion this beer does better started out quite a bit colder. It goes beautifully with many foods, but I consider it best paired with spicy Thai stir fry, a hearty steak, or barbecued ribs.
An-Nu’man replied:
As children of God we sometimes get the idea that we should not have to experience pain or suffering. In fact, one of the misconceptions in Christian society today is that once you accept Christ as Lord and Savior you begin a new life where everything runs smoothly.
Friends, I ask you this; Is it not our calling to seek a life that mirrors that of Christ? The process of sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in making changes in us that will lead us down the path of being like Christ. Notice this as told in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 (NASB) “Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” We are to be preparing for the return of Christ by allowing God to work in us so that at His coming we are to be without blame. But we cannot do this within our own power. 1 John 2:3-6 (NASB) says “By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments. The one who says, "I have come to know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him: the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.” Read that last line again. “The one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.” The Apostle gives a clear command in 1 Corinthians 11:1 (NASB) “Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.”

The Curse of Gremdon is dichotomy. The women are separate and not equal to the men. It's the an almost polar opposite of our society (I say almost, because of the recent rhetoric in politics), but easily understood, and detested. Life within the wall for this fantasy realm would be unbearable, both for the repression and the horrible treatment of the people who live there. It's also an excellent story, a captivating read that demanded my attention. I had to see if our lovers would survive, if the Elders would remain in control or if they would meet their much deserved ends. It's another recommended read for me. Fantasy lovers and paranormal romance lovers would find it most easy to devour. Five out of five fairy kisses for this reader.

At Young Gul’s place, Young Gul is drinking while Anna is asleep in his arms. LITERALLY.

And he’s adorably arranging three lunch boxes in his relaxation room, all smiles. However, he gets a text from Ga Young thanking him for his words but saying she’ll eat outside. That dampens his mood and he starts chugging down food, trying to keep himself upbeat telling himself it’s delicious but finally puts the box back down. He walks into the working room to find Ga Young half working, half eating.
In the Earthbag Building book, Kaki and Donald say, "Action dispels doubt," and that has become sort of a mantra for me. Every time I've felt overwhelmed by the scope of the task, not having a clue what I'm doing, I've simply gone out there and started, and something in me has known what to do. It's as though the earth in my bones is listening to the earth beneath my feet; it's an intuition deeper than than an idea.

With the exception of the few minutes he got his shots he was super happy and smiley and cooed at the pretty nurse and his doctor.

They are not allowed to talk to each other, and they have been given ten minutes to figure out their hat color.

These frightful murders, the low point of the Troubles in terms of their sheer bestial brutality, were not only well within the boundaries of what Islamic terrorists seem to allow themselves, but very similar to what appears to constitute a key operational option for these people. The beheading, on camera, of those unfortunate enough to fall into their hands, is something we have come to expect from Muslim terrorists, and that this material should be used in recruitment attempts tells us something about Muslim psychology and the opinions of Muslim terrorists as to what will excite and motivate their fellow Muslims.

If it weren't for the government demanding that I carry car insurance, I wouldn't. I am not sure about other states, but the law in Florida is that a vehicle owner must have insurance that pays the owners and occupants of other vehicles in the event that an accident occurs that is the insured driver's fault. In other words, you insure everyone except yourself. To insure your own vehicle costs extra. Here in Florida, there are so many drivers ignoring the law and driving without insurance, coverage for uninsured motorists is important.

At first glance this sort of thought may seem ridiculous, but this is 2012 and oddly enough saying something to thousands of people at a time isn’t uncommon. And just to add to the pile of crazy that social media has created for us, it’s up to others to decide how far our words are carried and we all just have to hope that when the day comes that our words are carried much farther than we ever thought, that it will be words we’re proud of.

But what seems like a hallucination to everyone else is a chilling reality for Mara. Someone from her past has discovered her strange, disturbing secret and that someone wants her to pay. But she's about to discover that the price is more than she can bear.
I have seen sooo so many fab ideas on Pinterest and Etsy and one i thought was a fab idea was Decorated Pegs! Who wants boring old wooden pegs when you can have funky ones and it's a great way of using the fabulous Washi Tape! I have quite a few designs now so it's good to put them to use!
Back to the kitchen; a pantry had a window looking out to the enclosed back yard and police cells. A door led from the kitchen to the scullery on the right which had a back door into the yard. In the scullery was a copper for boiling up clothing, and a blue bag would be added to make ‘whites’ whiter. Under the copper was space for a small fire to heat the water. There was also a large old fashioned mangle on a stand with a bucket beneath to catch the water which was squeezed from the items as they passed between the wood rollers by turning a large handle. When I had my first cycle it was kept in this room as there was no shed. The last time my father chastised me was in this room, I can’t remember what it was about. He gave me a ‘ ding round the lug’ but it didn’t have much effect!

A giant vat is used to mix the ingredients according to a traditional recipe with modern technology directing the amounts needed. Computers also monitor quality control as the soup progresses. Soup is poured into individual cans and cooked. The cans are made on site by the Silgan Container Company which also reduces transportation costs. The classic labels made famous by the painter, Andy Warhol, are last to be added.

Later on, when I began to read proper novels, I discovered an altogether different kind of wolf. After my Tolkien phase (between the ages of 11-13) I moved on to the historical novels of Rosemary Sutcliff and Henry Treece, in which wolves often featured. These were real wolves, though, the kind of lean, dark killers who howled in the woods and hunted in packs, who took sheep and left blood behind. The kind of animals who scarily stared with their cold green eyes at humans from the edge of the forest, the place Rosemary Sutcliff described in one of my all-time favourite phrases, ‘the wood-shore’. There’s a whole Rosemary Sutcliff novel that centres on wolves, the amazing Warrior Scarlet. The book’s hero is Drem, a Bronze Age Celtic boy who was born with a withered arm. But in his tribe each boy must kill a wolf to prove himself a man, and Drem fails at his first attempt. The plot is gripping, the writing extraordinary, but it’s the wolves that will stay in your mind.

My Lesson from a Horse Whisperer
Later, Myra meets with Roy and tells him she was at the track. He asks if she saw his mother and Myra says "How could I? I was in the clubhouse." Roy says "Lilly wouldn't be in the clubhouse, would she? How did you know that?" Myra then says that she did see Lilly, but Lilly didn't see her. She mentions that Lilly is always nasty to her and mentions "I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is." Roy says "You must have some very knowledgeable friends." She acts as if her connections will pay off for the scam she's been pitching.

6. The lack of time constraints in text helps to prevent the use of rhetorical tricks, as one can step back and look at the argument again, or even go to someone else for a second perspective if they feel that the argument is ‘off’ (that is, it seems to make sense but has the echoes of an argument that in fact does not at all, or it seems to make sense but does not seem to make any valuable or relevant point, if any at all).
It's tempting, as a reporter, to spend a little time in a place, talk to a few people, and believe that you understand the place. But, of course, I don't really understand Hazleton. Yes, it's tempting to think so … and so much of it feels familiar. But I don't know what it's like to live here, what people are feeling. I hope that Joe Maddon's plan succeeds, that with some hard work and dedication and will they can bring the people of Hazleton closer and help more kids have childhoods with only good memories. I hope so.

To be clear: abortion when a fetus reaches 'viability' is murder, not manslaughter. All involved to make that happen are conspiring to commit murder. That means the 'patient', doctors, people who review tests and procedures, their clinic and its leaders... get where this is going? The only way this could ever drop to manslaughter is via ambivalent evidence, which means that all involved did NOT get enough evidence to prove the fetus was NOT viable. If States can start turning this into manslaughter on principled grounds, then more power to them. The long-standing traditions of 'quickening' being the first sign of life and birth being a major event, however, cuts both ways, which is why we have 'viability' language in the SCOTUS decision.
I think that might be gone, now.

Ignore anyone who talks about hybrid liquidation, coming out of liquidation or what happens to a company after liquidation. It’s all a mixture of wishful thinking and ignorance. A company that is liquidated ceases to be. It is an ex-company.
I'm reviewing Dark Summer, but I could equally have recommended Frozen In Time or Wishful Thinking, her other standalones. Or indeed, her series fiction. They're all great reads.
Most men don’t want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead, they sometimes take the apples from the ground that aren’t as good, but they are easy to get.
As you know, Maija and Sidhe are in Boston this week with their school. I know they are having fun, but I must admit that it is very strange being so far away from her on her birthday! It's also strange to think about my baby girl being 14 years old when I can remember so clearly just how tiny she was when we first met (8lbs 2oz and 21 inches long to be exact).
In the future, I might start this strategy sooner because it really helped get me to the end.

Goldstone has refused to disavow the report’s attempt to eliminate laws against terrorism from the international legal codex, and its refusal to acknowledge that Hamas is a terrorist organization. He has not renounced the preposterous characterization of Gaza as territory under Israeli occupation, or the report’s shocking claim that Israel’s limited economic sanctions against the Hamas government are an unlawful form of collective punishment. He continues to remain silent on the report labeling all Israelis liars to stamp Hamas’s anti-Israel libels with the imprimatur of truth. He has not yet expressed remorse about the report’s gratuitous inclusion of anti-Jewish slurs, such as its endorsement of the bigoted claim that Israeli Jews are dehumanized and paranoid.

The other day in a fit of "bad conscience" gardening I was hacking away at the overgrown shrubs outside our front door and found a nest, with big white eggs in it. The next day I peered in at the nest to find a Mama Duck peering out at me.

The Kindle is a really cool device, and I like how its matte, luminous screen is easy on the eyes for reading, but it really cannot not handle scanned-from-a-book PDFs. I tried for a few days when I briefly owned a Kindle to get it to pull up scanned documents, but it completely failed. There were a couple of types of software that I downloaded and tried converting said PDFs to Kindle's reader format, but it mostly resulted in garbled text, and it could not do anything about the aforementioned scanned documents. For me, that was the deal breaker. Sure, it's about 1/6th the cost of an iPad, but I needed something that could deal with the massive amounts of scanned and photocopied PDFs that are routinely assigned to me, and the Kindle just couldn't cut it in that department.

Louise Meintjes' Sound of Africa! documents the making of Isigqi's 1992 album by placing it within the context of South Africa's political history and the lineage of mbaqanga music itself. The only major flaw with the book is not the text - it is the fact that a copy of Lomculo Unzima was not included with the finished work. Long out of print, this album is presented to you by Electric Jive in the hope of plugging something of a gap that has remained unfilled heretofore. Although the material here does stray quite a bit from EJ's usual focus, we are sharing this recording not only to assist the ongoing internet documentation of all South African musics, but to bring added colour to the words of Meintjes' book - and to bring the voices of Jane Dlamini, Joana Thango and Janet Dlamini... and every musician associated with them... to life.

The discussion above deals with the primacy of the Bible and also J. F. Cowan’s remarks about that. Then too, in his chapter entitled “More Prayer in the Prayer Meeting,” Cowan held forth equally simple principles as to prayer. He wrote:
When most think of the word “Budget” they have images of confinement and withdrawal from society. On the contrary, budgets are useful when getting yourself on track and securing your personal finances. If you want to get your financial house in order a budget is the way to go.
This is a very intriguing notion, certainly, and in many ways, it “works” even though the actual inscriptions and syncretistic equations are not there on the ground to make it absolute and definite.
“Trouble follows the wind this night,” Lyla murmured softly, as if to no one in particular. Jake checked his response, since Morning Sky was known for her accurate gift of prophecy. He felt rooted to the kitchen floor, unable to move his feet in any direction, and a chill came over his heart.
I contacted WACAP for their input, and they responded with a lengthy response, insisting that I correct my "misunderstandings". I informed them that while I appreciated their perspective, the information in the following article originated from first-hand accounts of adoptive families and others. I did tell WACAP that I would be happy to post their comment at the end of the article, but they declined my offer. I personally have no ax to grind with WACAP, and appreciate the difficult position they find themselves in when dealing with China. They are used in this article merely as the unfortunate example to illustrate an extensive and deep-rooted problem; certainly other agencies are equally involved.
